The devaluation is only matched by the moment in 1931 when , under Ramsay MacDonald , the UK was forced to abandon the gold standard , plunging by more than 24 pc against the dollar .
The parallel is significant , since many economists have attributed the gold standard exit as one of the main reasons the UK enjoyed a relatively mild depression in the 1930s , while the US suffered mass unemployment and saw its economy shrink by a third .
SOME people are into feet .
Some are into feathers .
Some are into watching , and others , being watched .
The Republicans have developed an extreme case of executive - experience - fetishism .
Apparently 18 months running Alaska , and much more time running a tiny town , is vastly more experience than Barack Obama has .
It is also vastly more , then , than John McCain has .
( For the record , he briefly comanded a training squadron , in Florida , while in the Navy . )
It 's also vastly more than Lincoln , Kennedy , Johnson or Truman , just to rattle a few off the top of my head .
None were governors or mayors or ran a big business .
If the vice - presidency does n't count as executive experience — the veep , after all , just runs his own office — it 's more than Nixon .
It 's more than Bob Dole , whom the Republicans nominated in 1996 .
Jack Kemp , his running mate had at least run Housing and Urban Development , and an [ American ] football team .
Governors do include , however , Mike Dukakis and Jimmy Carter .
Hubert Humphrey was a mayor .
( So was another famous landslide loser , Rudy Giuliani . )
There is achievement in government , and there is lack of achievement .
Both Barack Obama and Sarah Palin have short careers in government , but both have had their moments .
Mr McCain and Mr Biden tower over both , despite their lack of executive experience , in my " experience " books .
But if you want to throw out Mr Biden 's experience and Mr Obama 's because they are legislative , throw out Mr McCain 's , too .
Vote the manager of your local Staples , who has more executive experience than John McCain .
Or throw out this bogus argument .

Mr Ferreyra was live on Cronica TV when he killed himself
A former police chief in Argentina , wanted for alleged crimes against human rights , has shot himself dead in front of television cameras .
Mario Ferreyra was giving an interview on top of a water tank at his home in the northern province of Tucuman .
Police were coming to arrest him when he killed himself .
Mr Ferreyra was wearing his customary black shirt and cowboy hat and told the interviewer that he was innocent and had not committed any crimes .
He then told his wife , Maria , that he would love her forever , pulled a pistol from his boot and shot himself behind the ear .
' Pact of silence '
The Cronica television cameras were still rolling , transmitting live , as the distraught family gathered round .
Police , who had come to arrest Mr Ferreyra at his farm , came running , but it was too late .
He was dead .
Mr Ferreyra was accused of kidnapping and torture during the military government that ran Argentina between 1976 and 1983 .
The victims ' families say the suicide was part of a pact of silence - that the ex-police chief would not testify against former colleagues accused of kidnapping and killing some of the tens of thousands of Argentines who died during a period that became known as the " Dirty war " .
Since my last article on integrating Storm with Django , I ’ve merged my changes to Storm ’s trunk .
This missed the 0.13 release , so you ’ll need to use Bazaar to get the latest trunk or wait for 0.14 .
The focus since the last post was to get Storm to cooperate with Django ’s built in ORM .
One of the reasons people use Django is the existing components that can be used to build a site .
This ranges from the included user management and administration code to full web shop implementations .
So even if you plan to use Storm for your Django application , your application will most likely use Django ’s ORM for some things .
When I last posted about this code , it was possible to use both ORMs in a single app , but they would use separate database connections .
This had a number of disadvantages :
The two connections would be running separate transactions in parallel , so changes made by one connection would not be visible to the other connection until after the transaction was complete .
This is a problem when updating records in one table that reference rows that are being updated on the other connection .
When you have more than one connection , you introduce a new failure mode where one transaction may successfully commit but the other fail , leaving you with only half the changes being recorded .
This can be fixed by using two phase commit , but that is not supported by either Django or Storm at this point in time .
So it is desirable to have the two ORMs sharing a single connection .
The way I ’ve implemented this is as a Django database engine backend that uses the connection for a particular named per-thread store and passes transaction commit or rollback requests through to the global transaction manager .
Configuration is as simple as :
DATABASE_ENGINE = ' storm.django.backend '
DATABASE_NAME = ' store - name ' STORM_STORES = {' store - name ' : ' database-uri'}
This will work for PostgreSQL or MySQL connections : Django requires some additional set up for SQLite connections that Storm does n’t do .
Once this is configured , things mostly just work .
As Django and Storm both maintain caches of data retrieved from the database though , accessing the same table with both ORMs could give unpredictable results .
My code does n’t attempt to solve this problem so it is probably best to access tables with only one ORM or the other .

Air marshal program in disarray , insiders say By Blake Morrison , USA TODAY
For years , the government touted federal air marshals as the best of the best — an " elite corps " of undercover officers trained to stop hijackings on commercial flights .
Two air marshals take handgun training at the FAA Technical Center in Pomona , N.J. By Tom Mihalek , AFP But today , after rushing to hire thousands of new marshals , the program is so beset with problems that sources say at least 80 marshals have quit , and other marshals say they are considering a class - action lawsuit over working conditions that they fear put travelers at risk .
Documents obtained by USA TODAY and interviews with more than a dozen current and former marshals from around the nation suggest many have grown disillusioned with a program that one says has become " like security - guard training for the mall . "
Hiring standards for marshals added since Sept. 11 have been lowered dramatically , sources say .
No longer must applicants pass a difficult marksmanship course that used to be the make - or - break test for the program .
In addition , many new hires were given guns and badges and put aboard flights before extensive background checks were completed .
At some of the agency 's more than 20 regional offices , the program has struggled to provide ammunition for shooting practice , sources say .
Despite the undercover nature of the work , officials have implemented a dress code that marshals worry identifies them to terrorists .
And scheduling has been haphazard :
While some marshals have not flown for weeks at a time , sources say others are working 12 - to 16 - hour days and are falling asleep or getting sick aboard flights .
" This used to be an elite , great group .
This used to be the baddest people you could find — war heroes , " says one marshal who joined the program just after the terrorist attacks .
" Now they 've turned this into a laughingstock . "
At least three incidents involving the conduct of individual marshals are under investigation by federal authorities .
In one incident last month , a marshal was removed from a flight in Washington after smelling of alcohol .
The head of the air marshal program confirms at least two cases in which marshals accidentally discharged their weapons , one in a hotel room in Las Vegas .
And sources say one marshal was suspended after he left his gun in a lavatory aboard a United Airlines flight from Washington to Las Vegas in December .
A passenger discovered the weapon .
By law , the marshals — all with top - secret security clearances — are not allowed to speak publicly about the program .
All requested anonymity and say they have been told they will be fired or prosecuted for talking to the media .
Based on a presidential order first issued in 1979 , they cannot form a union , either .
That 's why some of the marshals say they 're considering contacting lawyers .
They say they 're frustrated that managers ignore their concerns , and they have little hope that the organization will improve .
Officials with the new Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) downplay the concerns .
They say any organization that has grown as quickly as the air marshal division is bound to have some problems .
Although the precise number of marshals is classified , sources say about 6,000 have been hired since Sept. 11 .
Before the terrorist attacks , fewer than 50 marshals flew , and only on international routes .
Tom Quinn , the head of the program , disputes those figures and the number of marshals who have resigned .
" I 'm not going to share the number , but it 's significantly less " than 80 , he says .
The marshals with complaints , Quinn says , represent " a small number of disgruntled individuals who are total amateurs . "
" I 'm very pleased with the way the program is going so far .
...
We 've gotten it right , " he says .
' It 's not growing pains '
That 's not how some marshals see it .
They say they were lured to the program with promises of promotions and four - day workweeks to make up for the rigors of travel and days away from their families .
Now , they say they 've been misled or lied to , and they worry that new rules put them and travelers in harm 's way .
" A lot of people were drawn to this agency because it was a fresh agency , " says one manager involved in the hiring process .
" Now it 's spoiled to the point that it 's rotten .
They tell us to bear with it , that it 's growing pains .
It 's not growing pains .
It 's a disease . "
After Sept. 11 , the air marshal program became especially appealing to hundreds of law enforcement officers who guarded the nation 's borders , monuments and federal buildings .
Promises of better pay enticed many applicants , who left jobs with federal law enforcement agencies and local police departments .
The typical marshal earns about $ 52,000 a year , officials say — at least $ 2,000 to $ 5,000 more than a Border Patrol agent .
" The people I see staying are one of two types : people who were on the border working in the heat for 60 hours a week , and the other are local cops who are seeing another $ 18,000 to $ 20,000 a year in salary , " says the marshal who joined the program just after Sept. 11 .
But even some of those marshals have come to regret their decisions , says the president of the union representing border patrol agents .
" We 've had over 700 people go over there , and we hear from a fair number of those people — people who have left ( the air marshals ) , " says T.J. Bonner , head of the National Border Patrol Council .
Bonner says the former agents he talks with say " they made a mistake " by becoming air marshals .
' Real issues with morale ' " The folks were lured over and were told they'd be flying three days a week with a day of training .
Now they 're flying five days a week and rarely train , " Bonner says .
" They never in a million years thought they'd be taken advantage of the way they 're being taken advantage of . "
Documents obtained by USA TODAY , including e-mails , minutes from meetings and standard operating procedures for the division , underscore their complaints .
One memo from a June 18 teleconference of regional managers notes " real issues with morale in the ranks " of those applying for leadership positions in the program .
Among the concerns : A marksmanship test that simulates conditions a marshal might face aboard a jet was eliminated as a means of qualifying for the program , apparently to get more marshals on more flights quickly , sources say .
A manager and two sources within the TSA say the difficult shooting course was cut from qualification tests after a high number of applicants began failing what had once been the program 's critical requirement .
Program officials insist the shooting standards for marshals are among the highest for law enforcement organizations .
Regular training opportunities , such as time on the shooting range , are often precluded by the expanded flight schedules , marshals say .
Even getting bullets for shooting practice has proven difficult .
Quinn denies any office ever has struggled to provide ammunition to marshals .
" It 's never been true , " he says .
But one memo obtained by USA TODAY documents the problem last March : " The question keeps coming up and believe me I feel your pain , " says an e-mail to marshals from a manager in one regional office .
" We are getting bullets shortly .
...
You can shoot on your own time and buy bullets with your own money however . "
Although they work undercover , marshals at some regional offices have been ordered to adhere to a dress code that requires them to wear " conservative male or female business attire " during most of their trips , documents show .
Without special permission , they cannot dress more casually .
Quinn says working marshals reviewed the dress code before it was issued , and good marshals " would clearly understand , respect and appreciate " the policy .
He says marshals who provided details of the dress code to USA TODAY " are putting us all at risk . "
Do dress codes threaten cover ?
But marshals say making them look and dress alike is what threatens their cover .
" This is really dangerous , " says one marshal , who left the Justice Department for the air marshal program five months ago .
" We are so obvious , the terrorists do n't need to bring guns on the planes anymore .
They just need to gang up on us and take our guns . "
New hires were given badges and guns and put aboard flights before extensive background checks necessary for national security clearances were completed .
Quinn says that , in order to hire marshals quickly , the new hires were given waivers while the more extensive background checks were underway .
" Would I prefer it another way ?
Certainly , " he says .
So would some marshals .
" If someone slips through the cracks , how do you not know they 're not a terrorist ? " says one marshal who received a waiver .
" You 've already put them on a plane . "
Work schedules are disorganized .
Schedules reviewed by USA TODAY show marshals often fly with different partners each day , even though they were told during training that developing rapport with a partner was crucial .
Many end up flying more than 10 hours a day .
" It 's ridiculous , " says the marshal from the Justice Department .
" Guys are complaining about headaches and vertigo and dizziness .
We 're falling asleep .
We 're nodding off . "
And though one memo from a manager 's teleconference says the agency is " being judged on how many flights we can cover , " more than a dozen marshals in each of two offices were not scheduled for weeks at a time , sources say .
" In May , for 3 1 / 2 weeks , they forgot about me , " says one marshal .
" And not just me .
There had to be 15 guys in the office they forgot about .
We sat in the office watching kung fu movies . "
The marshal says many colleagues , cynical about the division 's failure to offer them training , jokingly considered the Bruce Lee movies " our close - quarters training . "
When the marshals repeatedly called the scheduling center in Atlantic City to try to get on flights , schedulers said , " Do n't worry about it .
You 're getting paid , " the marshal recalls .
Charge ' totally erroneous ' Quinn denies the marshal 's account .
" Totally erroneous , " he says .
" There was no office with federal air marshals sitting there watching kung fu movies for a month . "
Other marshals say they routinely work more than 50 hours a week but , because of a government pay structure for law enforcement officers , never earn overtime .
Instead , based on a policy called " law enforcement availability pay , " they are paid for 50 hours of straight time each week even if they work more than that .
Quinn says schedulers take into consideration whether marshals have worked long weeks and try to schedule them for less time in subsequent weeks .
But one manager says if marshals report more hours than 50 hours , time sheets are changed to reflect only the 50 hours .
" I do it on a weekly basis , " the manager says .
" I 'm having to white 'em out . "
When he speaks with marshals at regional offices , Quinn says he stresses two points : " Professionals embrace change .
Amateurs cling to the past and what somebody may have said to them along the way . "
But for some marshals , what they were told when they applied affected their decision to join the program .
In an Aug. 1 letter of resignation obtained by USA TODAY , one former marshal wrote of frustrations stemming from " the lies that were fed to myself , and most of my colleagues . "
The letter details concerns about scheduling , pay and promotions .
The marshal who wrote it would not comment on the letter , but he accepted a position outside the division " because I can trust the people and organization that I will be working for , " he wrote .
The new job , he wrote , pays " $ 11,000 less " than his air marshal salary .
“ Why do bloggers put so much focus upon growing RSS subscriber numbers to their blog if most of them only ever read your content in Feed Readers and do n’t visit your blog ? ”
This question ( or variations of it ) hit my inbox 3 times in 24 hours from different people so I thought I ’d tackle it as a post instead of individual replies .
Let me start by saying that this problem can be frustrating .
You see your RSS subscriber number growing by your actual visitor numbers remain steady – as do your comment numbers .
It can actually feel like you ’re wasting your time – I remember myself feeling kinda like this guy when I first noticed this happening to me :
Image by Sybren Stüvel
However all is not lost .
There are a number of points that I ’d like to make in responding to this question about RSS subscribers not visiting a blog .
I hope that they give those facing this problem a little hope , encouragement and also a few ways forward .
1 . A subscriber that never visits is better than a one off visitor who never returns
I had one blogger recently tell me that he ’d removed the option to subscribe to his blog via RSS from his blog because he did n’t want to ‘ give away ’ his content .
He wanted people who read his content to ‘ pay ’ him by visiting his blog ( and earning him money from his advertising ) and he saw RSS subscribers as ‘ freeloaders ’ .
My response to him was that I ’d rather have a subscriber who rarely visits my actual blog than a one off visitors who never returns because they have no way of keeping in touch .
While a subscriber might not actually visit your blog they are a powerful connection to have .
My reasons for this will hopefully become evident in the points that follow .
2 . Every post you put in front of a subscriber is an opportunity to reinforce your brand .
RSS subscribers are opting in to receive your content .
When they hit ‘ subscribe ’ they are putting themselves inside your sphere of influence and are asking you to teach , inspire and communicate with them .
Each time you hit publish on a post and a subscriber sees something that you ’ve written you have the potential to deepen the relationship , trust and influence that you have with your subscriber .
While this might not have an immediate pay off in terms of advertising revenue – it can have a long term ‘ pay off ’ .
3. RSS subscribers are Influencers
RSS is used by a smallish percentage of the population ( around 11 % at latest reports ) .
While the percentage may be smallish – I have a suspicion that they are a reasonably tech savvy and influential bunch of people .
I ’m guessing here – but I suspect that those who use RSS are also likely to have blogs themselves , they ’re more likely to be into social networking , messaging and bookmarking tools .
This makes RSS readers a potentially very influential audience – capable of spreading news of your posts and blog throughout the web very quickly .
4. Making the Mind shift from Traffic to Influence
When I started blogging one of the main indicators that I looked at when measuring the success of my blog was traffic .
If I had a day with lots of visitors I was happier than if I did not have anyone visit my blog .
While traffic is still important to me – I ’ve noticed lately that I ’m checking my visitor stats less than I used to .
These days I ’m increasingly interested in ‘ influence ’ .
I do n’t mind so much if someone reads my content on my blog , in an RSS reader or in some other tool – what matters to me is that people are reading it , that in doing so they interact with me , that they are drawn into some sort of ‘ relationship ’ or ‘ community ’ around the content .
My reason for this is that I ’m finding that while traffic can be monetized directly – influence is actually a more powerful ( and potentially profitable ) thing .
Let me explain more in my next point .
5. Influence can Lead to Profits
More and more bloggers are discovering that while direct income earners like advertising are great – that there ’s also incredible potential for bloggers to earn an income through other more indirect income sources .
Making money ‘ because ’ of a blog rather than directly ‘ from ’ a blog is possible in may ways including consulting , writing books , running training and workshops , selling products , landing other paid writing gigs , speaking at conferences etc .
The more people that you have some kind of influence with the increased chances of being able to monetize that influence in one of these indirect methods .
A subscriber might not be visiting your blog each day but if you provide great content on a daily basis to them you can bet that the day they decide that they need to hire a consultant on your topic that they ’ll come knocking on your door .
6. Other Monetization Models for RSS
Indirect income is not the only possibility for RSS .
There is also RSS advertising – this industry is still in its infancy and while is n’t hugely profitable using tools like AdSense I ’m hearing bloggers reporting that it ’s a growing income source for them .
The other great opportunity for income from RSS subscribers is affiliate programs .
This taps into point # 5 above – when you have ‘ influence ’ or trust established with readers an affiliate program can be very profitable .
7 . The challenge of drawing subscribers into your blog
Just because someone subscribes to your blog does not mean that they ’ll never visit it .
In fact RSS subscribers can be among your most regular visitors to your blog if you draw them into actually visiting it .
I wo n’t go into a lot of techniques for this in this post but using techniques like asking questions , running polls , interlinking posts , writing ‘ best of ’ lists and more techniques can draw subscribers into visiting your blog on a daily basis .
Read more detailed tips on getting RSS readers visiting your blog .

[ New Deal or Raw Deal ?
How FDR 's Economic Legacy Has Damaged America .
By Burton Folsom , Jr. Threshold Editions , 2008 .
Xvi + 318 pages . ]
Readers of The Mises Review will not be surprised to learn that Folsom considers the New Deal a failure .
Nevertheless , even those already familiar with such books as John T. Flynn 's The Roosevelt Myth will find Folsom 's book valuable .
Folsom advances new and important arguments .
His anti–New Deal verdict is hard to dispute : levels of unemployment at the end of the 1930s remained at depression levels .
In May 1939 , Treasury Secretary Henry J. Morgenthau Jr. , one of Franklin Roosevelt 's best friends , testified before the House Ways and Means Committee : " I say after eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started …
And an enormous debt to boot " ( p. 2 ) .
When he spoke , unemployment exceeded 20 percent .
Further , and here Folsom has absorbed the pioneering research of Robert Higgs , not even the onset of World War II ended the Depression .
True enough , unemployment ended ; but this was only because of the draft .
Absent this military slavery , there is every reason to think that Roosevelt would have continued to struggle with unemployment .
A diehard defender of Roosevelt might essay two replies to this indictment .
He might argue that Roosevelt was insufficiently far - reaching : despite his radical reputation , Roosevelt only reluctantly embraced the Keynesian prescription of increased public spending .
Roosevelt did indeed spend a great deal on government programs ; but this must be balanced against his tax increases .
When the two are taken together , the stimulus that New Deal outlays provided the economy was less than needed to restore prosperity .
William Leuchtenburg , one of the most influential historians of the New Deal , favors this approach .
" The havoc that had been done before Roosevelt took office , " Leuchtenburg argues , " was so great that even the unprecedented measures of the New Deal did not suffice to repair the damage . " …
Some historians say that FDR should have done more deficit spending during the recession of 1937 . ( p. 12 )
Folsom wisely rejects this argument .
It rests on a familiar fallacy , classically exposed by Frédéric Bastiat in the 19th century and Henry Hazlitt in the 20th .
Spending by the government does not add to employment , since taxes displace private spending and investing .
Folsom aptly quotes Hazlitt in this connection :
" Every dollar of government spending must be raised through a dollar of taxation , " Hazlitt emphasized .
If the WPA builds a $ 10 million dollar bridge , for example , " the bridge has to be paid out of taxes …
Therefore , " Hazlitt observed , " for every public job created by the bridge project a private job has been destroyed somewhere else …
All that has happened , at best , is that there has been a diversion of jobs because of the project .
( p. 84 )
Keynesians of course have a response ready .
They will say that investors , owing to pessimism about the future , would not have spent on their own the money the government takes in taxes .
Instead , they would have hoarded it ; had the money remained in private hands , the increase in employment would have been less than what occurred under the beneficent auspices of Washington .
Folsom ably dispatches this Keynesian canard .
If businessmen were reluctant to invest , precisely the antibusiness attitude of the Roosevelt administration was in large part responsible .
Roosevelt supported confiscatory rates of taxation ; small wonder , then , that investors were reluctant to embark on new projects .
They had good reason to think that if they were to be successful , Roosevelt would grab their profits for his own dubious schemes .
Polls of businessmen taken in 1939 make evident this reluctance .
In March 1939 , for example , AIPO [ American Institute of Public Opinion ] asked a national sample , " Do you think the attitude of the Roosevelt administration toward business is delaying business recovery ? "
More than twice as many respondents said " yes " as said " no . " ( p. 248 )
Unfortunately , there is a gap in Folsom 's case .
His argument , as so far presented , is sound ; but what if the government simply increases the money supply ?
In that case , defenders of interventionism will claim , the new jobs created by the government generate a net increase in employment .
To refute this , one needs the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
Government spending , if it takes place through the expansion of bank credit , will , if " successful , " result in another artificially created boom .
The recovery thus generated will result in the long run in even worse economic distress , once that new boom in turn collapses .
Nor can a policy of further monetary expansion indefinitely postpone disaster .
Eventually people 's confidence in the monetary system will crumble , and a hyperinflation will result .
Folsom , though not blind to the danger of inflation , ignores Austrian theory .
In his own account of the continued severity of the depression that began in 1929 , he rightly stresses the malign effects of the Smoot - Hawley tariff .
Its extraordinarily high rates greatly restricted trade , not only through restricting imports but also because of retaliatory tariffs imposed by other nations .
But he says nothing at all about the Austrian view , i.e. , that the expansion of bank credit during the 1920s was the principal cause of the 1929 crash .
Quite the contrary , he follows Milton Friedman and the Chicago School in bemoaning the Federal Reserve 's contraction of the money supply .
He appears not to be aware of the Austrian view .
He does not cite Hayek or Mises on the cycle , and he ignores Lionel Robbins 's outstanding The Great Depression .
( The fact that Robbins wrongly repudiated his own book should not make one reluctant to benefit from its analysis . )
He includes only one reference to Rothbard 's America 's Great Depression , and this is in connection with Herbert Hoover and the RFC ( p. 276 , note 18 ) .
But I come not to bury Folsom , but , mostly , to praise him .
One of his best insights is that the New Deal programs were financed in large part by the poor .
At Roosevelt 's behest , excise taxes were imposed on many popular items of consumption ; and these weighed especially heavily on the impoverished .
" In the first four years of Roosevelt 's presidency , revenue from excise taxes exceeded that of income and corporate taxes combined " ( p. 126 ) .
( I do not think it right , though , to call excise taxes " regressive , " as Folsom does .
Everyone paid the same rate ; the poor were not charged more . )
This was far from the only way in which New Deal programs hurt the poor .
Blacks fared very badly under Roosevelt , the supposed great exemplar of enlightened modern liberalism .
Minimum - wage laws proved a stumbling block to efforts by blacks to secure jobs .
These laws prevented employers from undercutting unions by offering lower wages to nonunion members .
Since blacks faced exclusion from many of the powerful unions , they were in effect frozen out .
Roosevelt , by the way , allowed unions freely to violate private - property rights : sit - down strikes , i.e. , the forcible seizure and occupation of an employer 's property , were for him quite in order .
In the famous sit - down strike by Walter Reuther 's United Auto Workers against General Motors , neither " Governor Frank Murphy of Michigan nor President Roosevelt was willing to support evicting the strikers from GM property " ( p. 120 ) .
Roosevelt was not much concerned with the effects of his programs on blacks .
Indeed , he did little to support civil rights : he would not , e.g. , support antilynching legislation .
To do so might antagonize important Southern congressmen .
Despite his seeming indifference to blacks , Roosevelt gained support among many members of the black community , in part owing to carefully calibrated publicity gestures by members of his administration .
Nevertheless , several prominent blacks saw through him .
Roosevelt snubbed Jesse Owens after the latter 's triumph at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games ; and thereafter Owens campaigned against him .
Joe Louis sent a telegram of support to Wendell Willkie in the 1940 election : " ' Win by a knockout , ' Louis telegrammed " ( p. 210 ) .
Folsom ably addresses an objection to his anti-Roosevelt thesis .
If Roosevelt 's policies were such a miserable failure , why was he reelected ?
In 1936 , he won by a landslide over the Republican candidate , Governor Alf Landon of Kansas .
Moreover , not even the most bitter anti-Roosevelt partisan can deny the president 's popularity .
In part , Folsom claims , the answer lies in Roosevelt 's great personal charm .
Even opponents , such as the eminent journalist Arthur Krock , found themselves under its sway .
Krock once explained to Roosevelt why he no longer attended presidential press conferences .
" You charm me so much that when I go back to write a comment on the proceedings , I can't keep it in balance " ( p. 223 ) .
But Folsom has a deeper explanation .
Roosevelt manipulated welfare programs , especially jobs under the WPA , to gain votes .
WPA officials were quite willing , if need be , to twist arms in order to gain votes for the president and his congressional supporters .
More generally , under the expert advice of Emil Hurja , the principal assistant to Postmaster General James Farley , polls were undertaken to indicate where patronage and pork could be used to best advantage .
Folsom here uses to good advantage a long - forgotten book , Who Were the Eleven Million ? by David Lawrence , the founder and editor of US News & World Report .
Through a county - by - county analysis of the 1936 election , Lawrence showed that voting for Roosevelt varied directly with the patronage and jobs extended .
Sometimes one can trace in detail the way particular acts of political beneficence shifted voters to the Democratic camp .
The Republicans were caught in a bind .
As the party out of power , they could not match Roosevelt as a dispenser of favors .
They could to an extent try the path of virtue , denouncing Roosevelt 's tactics for what they were ; but this tactic could not be pushed too far .
To do so risked alienating voters who benefited from the government 's largesse .
Thus , Landon promised to maintain payments to farmers under the AAA , fatally compromising his denunciation of Roosevelt for political manipulation of welfare .
Folsom places great emphasis on Roosevelt 's character , and the president comes off very poorly indeed .
Politicians are hardly noted for honesty , but even judged by the low standards of the breed , Roosevelt was mendacious .
In a speech in the 1920 election , when he ran for vice president on the Democratic ticket , Roosevelt falsely claimed to have drafted the constitution of Haiti .
When challenged , he denied ever making the statement , though numerous witnesses attested that he had done so .
Folsom might also have mentioned the charges of dubious dealings leveled against Roosevelt 's Warm Springs Foundation for polio victims .
( Folsom does mention this project but says little about it . )
The president did not grow more honest with age .
Though he had promised to stay neutral in the fight between Alben Barkley and Pat Harrison for Senate majority leader , he came down decisively for Barkley , who won the vote , 38 - 37 .
As a result , he converted the popular Harrison from a strong New Dealer to an opponent .
Roosevelt also had an unslakeable thirst for power .
Though the 1936 elections gave the Democrats overwhelming control of Congress , this was not enough for Roosevelt .
He sought to purge those who were not fully behind his program .
In particular , he could not forgive those who dared to oppose his unsuccessful proposal to pack the Supreme Court .
He opposed long - serving and influential Democratic congressmen , favoring instead more pliant newcomers .
( One favorite was Lyndon Johnson , whose later efforts to bring the New Deal to South Vietnam were not altogether a success . )
In most cases , Roosevelt 's efforts proved unavailing .
The once - dominant Roosevelt , despite his undoubted political gifts , found himself in a much weaker political position at the end of the 1930s than he had been in 1936 .
Roosevelt had overreached .
Roosevelt 's quest for power and disdain for criticism had a sinister side .
He used government agencies , especially the FBI and IRS , to harass his political opponents .
Thus , at the president 's instigation , a case of tax evasion against former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon was pursued , though known to be without basis by Elmer Irey , the head of the special intelligence unit of the IRS .
Robert Jackson , who ordered the prosecution of Mellon , was later elevated to the Supreme Court .
Mellon was eventually vindicated .
As soon as Jesse Owens and Joe Louis criticized Roosevelt , IRS investigations of them commenced .
Readers of this well - documented book will view Roosevelt with distaste .
David Gordon covers new books in economics , politics , philosophy , and law for The Mises Review , the quarterly review of literature in the social sciences , published since 1995 by the Mises Institute .
He is author of The Essential Rothbard , available in the Mises Store .
Comment on the blog .
KYOTO , Japan ( Reuters ) - When Satoru Iwata became the president of Nintendo Co Ltd six years ago , the video game world was ruled by Sony Corp ’s PlayStation 2 and populated by young men .
Nintendo Co Ltd's President Satoru Iwata speaks during an interview with Reuters at the company 's headquaters in Kyoto , western Japan , December 8 , 2008 .

Iwata knew the market could be much bigger than that .
Under his watch , Nintendo started inventing products for an unlikely crowd of gamers from pensioners eager to train their memory to yoga students perfecting their poses .
“ Today there are people who play and who do n’t .
We ’ll help destroy that wall between them , ” Iwata said in May 2006 ahead of the year - end launch of the Wii console .
Unlike most consoles , the Wii is meant to appeal to everyone , whether their idea of entertainment is a tranquil round of golf or a battle with fantasy warriors .
“ Regardless of age , gender or game experience , anyone can understand Wii , ” Iwata said at the time .
His prediction proved accurate : The Wii turned into a bestseller and has consistently outsold its rivals .
Global Wii sales came to 34.6 million units as of the end of September , against 16.8 million for the PlayStaion 3 and 22.5 million units for Microsoft Corp ’s Xbox 360 .
Iwata ’s knack for unconventional solutions has marked his career , including his rise to the top at Nintendo , the world ’s largest video game maker and creator of the well - loved game characters Mario and Donkey Kong .
He became president at 42 , in a country where executives at major listed corporations tend not to make that step until their late 50s or early 60s , if not later .
Iwata ’s predecessor , Hiroshi Yamauchi , a member of the founding family , picked him for the top job only two years after he joined the company .
Yamauchi himself had held that position for more than half a century .
TEENAGE Programing
Iwata was hooked by computer programing at high school and studied computer science at Japan ’s top technology university , Tokyo Institute of Technology .
In 1982 he joined HAL Laboratory , a small game maker , only to watch it fail about a decade later .
Instead of leaving the firm in search of safer and better - paid work as a game developer , Iwata agreed to become its president and helped it return to profit .
He moved to Nintendo in 2000 and helped it launch the GameCube console the following year .
The GameCube never really took off , however , overshadowed by the far more popular PlayStation 2 .
Yamauchi recognized Iwata ’s rare ability to understand both the hardware and software aspect of the game business .
That ability shows through in the Wii , which combines games for different age levels and interests with unusual hardware , such as a motion - sensing controller that can be swung like a tennis racket or a baseball bat .
Nintendo’s other bestseller , the DS handheld game player , also appeals to a broad fan base with software that includes puzzles , memory exercises and educational games , for example for learning Chinese characters .
Players can use a stylus instead of a key pad to operate the DS , something that appeals to people who are used to working with a pen but find key pads unfamiliar .

EYEING IPOD
Helped by these features , the DS has outsold the PlayStation Portable two - to - one and is now encroaching on the territory of other gadgets .
Last month , Nintendo started selling a DS model that can take pictures and play music , taking on Apple Inc ’s iPod and iPhone .
“ We find ourselves at an unprecedented stage where one in every six people ( in Japan ) has a DS , ” Iwata said at a news conference to unveil the new model .
“ We will strive not only to appeal to those households without the DS , but to promote a shift to ‘ one DS per person ’ from ‘ one DS per household ’ . ”
Nintendo expects its operating profit to jump 29 percent to 630 billion yen in the year ending March , more than three times that of Sony .
Whether it can keep up that kind of trend in a global economic downturn remains to be seen -- after all , even Iwata , now 49 , acknowledges that Nintendo ’s products are not strictly necessary .
“ We are producing something people can live without .
But we need to keep thinking what would make our products a priority purchase even if they are not a necessity , ” Iwata said in October of this year .
“ If we stop doing that , no matter how successful Nintendo is at the moment , things will start going wrong in no time . ”

------------------------------
1 ) ABOUT THE NEWSGROUP 1.1 )
What is alt.sysadmin.recovery ?
Alt.sysadmin.recovery is for discussion by recovered and recovering sysadmins .
It is a forum for mutual support and griping over phenomenally stupid users , mind - bogglingly unhelpful tech support , surprisingly lousy software , astonishingly deficient hardware , and generally how idiotic this job is .
Think of it as a virtual pub where we cann all go after hours to gripe about our job .
Since the concept of " after hours " is unknown to your average sysadmin , we have this instead .
Warning :
If you are a user , you may well see your sysadmin posting messages about how stupidd YOU are .
( But none of us will be surprised when you fail to take heed of this warning . )
1.2 ) Special note REE : alt.humor.best-of-usenet
It is prohibited to re-post alt.sysadmin.recovery messages to alt.humor.best-of-usenet .
Most ASR denizens have nothing against that group itself , but sometimes in the past we have averaged a few messages a day there .
This has drawn the lusers here like moths to a candle -- more unpleasant for the moths than for the candle , but we do n't care about the moths .
We strongly recommend that you put " X - No - Ahbou : yes " in your headers .
1.3 ) What is not welcome on alt.sysadmin.recovery ?
If many people object to your articles , consider the possibility that it might be you .
Some people are just a waste of skin .
But occasionally it will be the topic , rather than the user .
Not welcome on alt.sysadmin.recovery are : advocacy , user questions , users ( unless you are a sysadmin in another life ) , amateur salespeople , or general cluelessness .
Particularly unwelcome is ANY real sysadmin related stuff .
Useful ( to our job ) information is forbidden .
It does n't matter if you ROT - 13 it , cast it as a sonnet , or attach it as a mime - encoded mpeg , just do n't do it .
We are here to escape , and there are plenty of other newsgroups that will be able to answer your question .
And please avoid excessive quoting , " me toos " , etc .
There are things that have become tedious .
Gratuitous ROT - 13 ( especially frequent switching on and off within a message ) , $ USEE $ OF $ SHELL $ VARIABLES , ranting about it ( a single , well - aimed " BLAM " will suffice when necessary ) , and anything else the Official ASR Taste Committee deems tired .
Yes , you are smart , young , old , had trouble in school , enjoyed school , never went to college , use vi , use emacs , hate them both , read Robert Heinlein , have a cool web page , and practice martial and marital arts .
Please do n't tell us about it .
To repeat , ROT - 13 does not make a posting acceptable .
It can , however , interfere with luser searches .
Sometimes we rotate text to avoid lusers who might search for their own name or their company name , and we certainly rotate common luser - magnet software names such as yvahk .
( There is still a debate about whether or not you have to rotate the ' Q ' word , but indeed the article http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=97ltlp%24s21%241%40atlas.dgp.toronto.edu did not cause untoward summoning . )
MMost of all : DO NOT mention how to post here , do n't even hint about it , and do n't tell them or hint about it by e-mail .
It 's already far too easy to work it out .
Those who belong here can figure out how to post .
Unfortunately , so can several people who do n't belong here .
Fortunately , we usually manage to make such posters leave " willingly " .
By the way , , do n't cross-post to newsgroups with different moderation policies ( e.g. unmoderated groups ) .
It accomplishes nothing and annoys the pig , or something like that .
11.4 ) What does BOFH mean ?
How about LART ?
TTTSNBN ?
PFY ?
Cow - orker ?
BOFH : Bastard Operator From Hell .
Our role model .
( The Bastard Operator From Hell was originally a series of stories written by Simon Travaglia , s.travaglia@waikato.ac.nz .
See section 7 . ) LART : Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool .
Something large , heavy , and painful .
TTTSNBN : [ sorry , I can't name it here ]
PFY : A term for a junior sysadmin indicating both age and skin condition , both often metaphoric .
Cow - orker : A one - time misplaced hyphen ( in alt.folklore.urban , in fact ) revealed a shameful truth here .
Copro-grammer : literally , " writer of feces " C|N>K : C is coffee , N is nose , K is keyboard ; and think unix shell syntax .
STR : synchronous transmit receive .
A mode of the synchronous communications adapter that provides for point - to - point operation only .
( Rumour has it that ' S ' actually secretly stands for " slurp " . )
1.5 ) Official ASR mottos
The official ASR motto , our catch phrase , is the immortal : " Down , not Across " It is our mantra .
We recite it to ourselves as we deal with the day - to - day realities of a life that is far more nasty , brutish , and short than even Hobbes could have ever imagined .
Some other mottos include : * clickety - click *
" Oh , lovely . " " Just DON'T . "
" I need a drink . "
" Either way I 'm screwed . "
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The official ASR position : Hiding in a corner , under a desk , in fetal position , arms covering head and quietly whimpering .
The official ASR luser position : 6 feet under .
1.6 ) If you find sysadminning to be such stress , why not find a job other than being a sysadmin ?
" Why not ?
Sure , why not ?
Why not just kick the heroin habit ?
Why not just stop breathing if the air gets polluted ? "
Sysadmins are driven by a desire to _make_it_work_ .
We loathe non-functioning pieces of crap .
Similarly , we hate seeing equipment working at substantially below its potential due to moronic admin decisions .
Does n't this mean we should shun sysadminning , then ?
Well , as you will see from discussion in ASR , we have this tendency to drift into the job .
It starts when you 're given a machine on your desk which crashes every five minutes , and you know how to make it crash only once every five days .
You get given the root / administrator password .
You end up fixing someone else 's machine too .
As word gets out , you have more and more people calling on you for basic computer administration assistance every week .
Eventually you get told that your sysadmin work is more important than what you were doing before .
Since you seem to be the only person in your company who is doing any work , you have to agree .
After a while , you quit and go to work for somewhere else , where you 're promised you wo n't have to be a sysadmin .
But the machine on your desk crashes every five minutes ...
1.7 ) What is the scary devil monastery ?
alt sysadmin recovery rancid mystery loaves steady micron slavery comedy striven salary trendy mosaic slavery convert already missy scary devil monastery misty adversary clone discover anal mystery 1.8 ) I hate this group !
Where do I complain ?
Probably you want the folks who run the net .
Address mail to : Usenet Central Administration 1060 West Addison Street Chicago , Illinois USA 60613-4305
Allow six to eight weeks for a response .
1.9 ) Why is this FAQ dated April 22006 even though it was last updated in May 2007 ?
Ha ha , April Fools !
------------------------------
2 ) AABOUT OUR FINE PROFESSION 2.1 ) I want to be a sysadmin .
What should I do ?
Seek professional help .
2.2 ) So , I 've just " volunteered " to be a sysadmin .
What do I do ?
See 5.4 . 2.3 ) Where do sysadmins rank as a profession ?
Appparently held in considerably lesser regard than building maintenance , because no one goes complaining to the janitors saying that it's the janitors ' fault that they can't manage to throw garbage into their garbage bin from across the room .
2.4 ) What 's a typical day in the life of a sysadmin ?
Perrhaps Abby Franquemont summarized the life of a sysadmin the best , when she described us as : " disgruntled , disenchanted with things we used to really get a kick out of , foul tempered , hard - drinking , heavy - smoking , overworked , with no real social life to speak of . "
Or perhaps she was being optimistic .
2.5 ) Do sysadmiins all drink a lot ?
Most sysadmins seem to , but there are always exceptions .
In particular , some psychotropic medication makes you react very strongly to alcohol ; if you 're on such medication , you find that you can't _ever_ have dozens of drinks in an evening , and if you have five drinks in an evening you 'll feel like you used to when you occasionally had dozens .
Then as you drink less your tolerance decreases , and pretty soon one drink will make you too drunk to go back to work after lunch .
All this is to say that psychotropic medication ( e.g. SSRIs ) seems to be either software or hardware , because it sucks .
And for some reason , a llot of sysadmins seem to need medication .
See section 5 . 22.6 ) Why can't I find my sysadmin ?
Would you want to be found by a luser ?
------------------------------
3 ) OUR LITTLE FRIEND , THE COMPUTER 3.1 )
Are there any OSes that do n't suck ?
No. See http://www.ehlke.net/os-suck.html
3.2 ) How about any hardware ?
The PDP - 100 was pretty nice .
Pity they are n't made any more .
3.3 ) Just HOW MUCH does this system suck ?
The ASR standard unit of suckiness is the Lovelace ( Ll ) .
This is defined as : One Lovelace is the amount of force ( measured in dynes ) it takes to draw a round ball weighing e Troy Ounces down a tube it fits exactly ( in air ) at a speed of pi attoparsecs / microfortnight .
Like Farads , this is a rather large measurement .
Thus , Plan 9 sucks a few mLl , for instance , while your average Microsoft product achieves many Ll. 3.4 )
Where can I find clueful tech support ?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
There is a device the telco puts on the phone that ensures that whoever is on the other end of a service call is always a drooling moron with the IQ of a potted plant .
Note that this applies both ways ( see 4.1 ) .
3.5 ) What can I do to help my computers behave ?
Some go for the carrot approach , others the stick , others both .
If you favour the carrot , try offering memory upgrades or faster processors .
For sticks , try bullwhips .
Many computers are easily fooled , so placing a picture of yourself in front of a computer will often cause it to think you are watching and it will be too scared to misbehave .
Remember that if computers are networked , they can talk to each other .
That is useful in that you can make an example of one and the others will watch ( and hopefully learn ) .
Of course , some computers require a blood sacrifice .
But you do n't have to worry about this one , because they will simply take the blood without asking .
------------------------------
4 ) OUR BIG HEADACHE , THE LUSERS 4.1 ) I 'm on tech support .
Where can I find clueful customers ?
See item 3.4 .
A clueful luser is an oxymoron .
4.2 ) Some tips for general luser interaction - lusers , bless their little hearts , have simple minds .
Even if you think that a lobotomized flatworm could understand your instructions , your luser probably wo n't .
And we tried lobotomizing a few lusers to see if it would help , but it did n't make any detectable difference .
- since lusers will neither read nor understand any docs you write for them , just do n't even bother .
- NEVER anthropomorphize lusers .
4.3 ) What is the best way to deal with lusers ?
Lusers are much easier to deal with if they are n't breathing .
240V across the heart , a revolver round through the head , or even a simple little broadsword thrust into their abdomen will improve your interactions wonderfully .
See next item .
4.4 ) Revolvers , cyanide and high voltages :
The pros and cons of various luser education strategies .
There has been a great deal of debate on ASR about the best way of dealing with lusers , and at this time no consensus has been reached .
What we can suggest , however , is to be sure it is painful , clean , and does n't harm the computer .
That unfortunately leaves a lot of options out ; you can't just throw a grenade at them ; it will hurt the machine .
4.5 ) How can I clean up the mess made by a luser 's brain splattered across a monitor ?
First of all , be careful .
While cluelessness is not contagious , there are some nasty things that can be picked up from lusers , such as blood - transmitted diseases .
( Watch out for Creutzfeldt - Jacob syndrome , aka mad cow disease .
Of course , we are all mad anyway . )
Be sure to wear latex gloves -- available for 40 cents a pair ' round here -- when you 're through , remove them by peeling them off carefully so that they end up inside - out , and discard .
Luser guts will usually clean up with soap and water .
They say that to clean up blood you should use cold water , not warm ; a little bleach sometimes helps for the more stubborn cases .
Be sure to get all of the blood off the keyboards or the keys may get very sticky .
To get rid of the body , people have suggested using several garbage bags and a large quantity of duct tape .
If you have to keep it for a while , try to remove the guts ; that will keep the smell down .
Alcohol and formalin works well as a preservative .
4.6 ) What is the penalty for murdering a luser ?
Unfortunately , in the eyes of the law , lusers are treated like humans .
We therefore recommend you be discreet in your luser era^H^Hducation campaigns .
4.7 ) How much should I charge for holding their hands ?
See the official ASR price list at http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~moose/sysadmin/pricelist.html
------------------------------
5 ) DEALING WITH BEING A SYSADMIN 5.1 ) Caffeine and other recreational pharmaceuticals Caffeine : Much information about this can be found on alt.drugs.caffeine .
See FAQs at http://db.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/caffaq.html
Booze : Much low - quality information around the net these days .
Perhaps try rec.food.drink .* , alt.drunken.bastards , http://www.beerinfo.com, and / or http://www.camra.org.uk
Other : rec.drugs .* , http://www.lycaeum.org
5.2 ) The ASR Drinking Game
The rules for the ASR Drinking Game , as hashed out over a period of several decades ending on 27 January 20007 , are quite simple .
When something happens , drink .
As much as necessary .
5.3 ) The excuse server
This is an important net resource that lets you give the exact reason why you can't do something yesterday .
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ballard/bofh/
Or telnet bofh.jeffballard.us 666 Or telnet bofh.ucc.asn.au 666 5.4 )
The insults server
Once you have got rid of your lusers , you will probably want to tell them what they really are .
For this , the insults server is useful .
telnet insulthost.colorado.edu 1695 5.5 )
Should I slit my wrists across or downward ?
Downward .
See http://ash.spaink.net
5.6 ) Sysadmin tools
There are a number of tools important to system administration .
Most important are chemical by nature ; see item 5.1 .
A particularly useful tool , revered by many of ASR , is the noble chocolate - covered coffee bean .
Peter Corlett reports that they can also be bought from Cranberry ( stalls dotted around London and also rather more sparsely around the rest of the UK ) , and he has also seen fancily - packed versions at fancy prices in the food courts of the likes of House of Fraser and Selfridges as well as common or garden supermarkets .
You can also make your own .
Melt some chocolate , place some coffee beans in it , and Bjorn Stronginthearm 's your uncle !
Next in line is a good LART .
A 2x4 works fine , but a real professional needs something a little more effective .
Unfortunately , this is a very personal thing , and no consensus has yet been reached on the group .
Everything from a simple 7.65 mm
Walther ( for the Bond fans only ; it 's not a very good gun ) to a 155 mm with depleted Uranium rounds has been suggested , some even going for exotic things like Thermite , nukes , or flamethrowers .
For further info , look at the rec.guns home page ( http://recguns.com).
You can find a lot of cool stuff at Military Surplus stores .
Sadly , they do n't sell the _really_ interesting surplus stuff like tanks or F16s .
Try US Cavalry , 1-8800-777-7732 , or http://www.uscav.com.
When you ca n't use the LART ( e.g. you do n't want to damage a computer ) , Nerfs are excellent substitutes .
These are a range of foam weapons .
The leatherman is another useful tool .
The Perl of Swiss Army Knives , this should n't be too hard to find .
Finally , there are some tools a sysadmin is forbidden from having .
Adequate computing power is first on this list , but the most important is called a " life " .
And be warned : life is always eventually fatal .
5.7 ) Psychiatric assistance
If you are reading this , you need it .
Contact your family doctor .
Perhaps consider
http://www.aspergersyndrome.org.
Medication for depression and / or OCD these days is often an " SSRI " , a category of drug which changes your brain chemistry not subtly .
SSRIs tend to have a range of seemingly unrelated side effects , such as decreased alcohol tolerance , difficulty reaching orgasm ( depending upon dosage and other factors ) , weight gain , intestinal changes .
But despite the drawbacks , some people report advantages such as greater stability , e.g. the ability to refrain from choking the living shit out of a luser who richly deserves it , and , occasionally , enjoyment of life .
See a pshrink near you to determine whether you could benefit from psychotropic medication .
Some of the checklists on the web are n't complete bullshit , but keep in mind that Sturgeon 's law was an underestimate for anything important .
5.8 ) But seriously , should I kill myself ?
Seriously , no .
As posted to ASR by Ed Evans : Ultimate recovery stalks us all , no need to succour it .
Quit or take a leave with or without pay ( or permission ) , stop seeing him or her , recognise that the cat or dog does rule you , call in sick and spend the day in the big blue room , it 's only money and can be earned again , all the pictures will be posted again , call the local professionals if you really feel that way ...
And if all else fails ?
Lawn mowing .
If you 're willing to take the severe step of killing yourself , you should be willing to take less severe steps such as quitting your job or taking a leave without permission .
And really , there _is_ help out there .
Maybe in here , too .
And more of us have been there than you may realize .
We 're grateful now that we did n't do it .
( Most days . )
In chess they have a saying , " You ca n't win by resigning . "
Keep playing ; you never know .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Archaeologists in China have discovered fossils of a pigeon - sized feathered dinosaur which they believe to be an ancestor of birds .
Its remains were found 90 percent complete , preserved in a slab of rock in Inner Mongolia ’s Ningcheng county in northern China , the researchers wrote in an article in Nature .
Its four limbs lacked contour feathers for flight and it probably lived from the Middle to Late Jurassic periods , or 176 to 146 million years ago .
This means it is older than the Archaeopteryx , which lived around 155 to 150 million years ago .
Feathered but flightless , the small creature weighed just 164 grams and had buck teeth resembling that of carnivores .
But scientists have no clue what it ate .
“ Insects ?
Other reptiles or amphibians ?
Or plants ? ” Professor Fucheng Zhang of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences wrote in reply to a question from Reuters regarding its diet .
Named the Epidexipteryx , it had four long and thin tail feathers and a short tail .
The scientists said it belonged to a different group from the Microraptor , which had flight feathers and which some scientists believe flew sometimes in addition to gliding .
But like the Microraptor -- which lived in a later period 130 to 125 million years ago -- it gave important evidence about the evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs .
“ You could say it was a link between dinosaur and birds .
It was very close to the ancestor of birds , ” Zhang wrote .
“ This new fossil adds yet more complexity to the early history of evolution from dinosaurs to birds . ”

Firefox Extension to Browse As If You Were in China
China Channel offers a Firefox extension for those outside of China mainland that aims to let you experience the web – and the Chinese web censorship – as if you were within China .
Not sure how well this works at all times ( for instance , I heard that sometimes different locations within China show different blocks ) .
When I installed the China Channel add - on and then searched Google.com for falun gong , I received a “ connection interrupted ” instead of the Google result page – without any doing of Google , I suppose , but based on the URL ’s parameter with functionality coming from the Chinese Ministry of Information .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. intelligence agencies believe Osama bin Laden is isolated from al Qaeda and spending much of his energy merely surviving , the head of the CIA said on Thursday .
Osama bin Laden remains on the run despite a $ 25 million reward for his capture .
CIA Director Michael Hayden said hunting down bin Laden remains his agency 's priority .
" He is putting a lot of energy into his own survival -- a lot of energy into his own security , " Hayden said in a speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington .
" In fact , he appears to be largely isolated from the day - to - day operations of the organization he nominally heads , " he said .
In recent weeks , there have been several U.S. missile strikes by unmanned drones around the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
The United States maintains that Taliban and al Qaeda forces operate with relative impunity in tribal areas along Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan and use those areas as staging grounds to attack U.S. forces and their allies inside Afghanistan .
Hayden said al Qaeda has been hurt by a sustained fight with the United States and its allies , but remains a threat .
" Al Qaeda has suffered serious setbacks , but it remains a determined , adaptive enemy unlike any our nation has ever faced , " Hayden said .
" The war is far from over . "
Regardless of whether bin Laden is actively helping lead the terrorist organization , the CIA believes capturing or killing him would be a huge blow to al Qaeda , according to Hayden .
" This is an organization that has never been through a change at the top , " he said .
" For 20 years , bin Laden has been the visionary , the inspiration or harmonizing force behind al Qaeda . "
Hayden said it remained to be seen whether bin Laden 's deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri , could maintain unity in the ranks without him .
" The truth is , we simply do n't know what would happen if bin Laden is killed or captured .
But I 'm willing to bet that whatever happens , it would work in our favor , " Hayden said .

The UK unemployment rate rose to 6 % in October At least 600,000 jobs could go in the UK in 2009 , according to a report by a personnel managers ' professional body .
The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development says even those who escape redundancy face pay freezes .
It says that while total unemployment will not hit three million , the time between New Year and Easter will be the worst for job losses since 1991 .
According to official statistics , there were 1.86 million people out of work in the UK in October .
That figure was the highest since 1997 , taking the overall unemployment rate to 6 % .
' Worst year ' Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The CIPD , which represents managers and personnel staff , issued its gloomy forecast a day after children 's retailer Adams joined a growing list of well - known chains applying for administration .
Chief economist John Philpott said : " This time last year , in the face of some scepticism , the CIPD warned that 2008 would be the UK 's worst year for jobs in a decade .
" It was , but in retrospect it will be seen as merely the slow - motion prelude to what will be the worst year for jobs in almost two decades .
" The CIPD 's annual barometer forecast is that the UK economy will shed at least 600,000 jobs in 2009 .
This is a time where organisations need to engage in an open and straightforward communication with staff
Charles Cotton
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development " Overall , the 18 - month period from the start of the recession in mid-2008 until the end of 2009 will witness the loss of around three quarters of a million jobs , equivalent to the total net rise in employment in the preceding three years . "
Mr Philpott said job losses were likely to continue into 2010 , taking the final toll to about one million .
The CIPD also surveyed 2,600 workers and found that more than one in four did not expect a pay rise next year , while others feared a wage cut .
The institute 's reward adviser , Charles Cotton , said employees were " realistic about their pay prospects " .
" Against this backdrop , employers will need to work hard to find new ways to motivate their employees to perform , " he said .
Financial incentives and targeted investment in training and development could be effective ways to do this , he added .
" More than ever , this is a time where organisations need to engage in an open and straightforward communication with staff , clearly explaining the reasons for any difficult measures that will affect them , " he said .
" This will help preserve staff loyalty and engagement even during times when unpopular decisions need to be made . "

This is Part Three of a series of articles on Java. next .
In Part Three , I will explore how the Java . next languages ( JRuby , Groovy , Clojure , and Scala ) support dispatch .
For my purposes here , dispatch is a broad term covering various methods of dynamically choosing behavior : single dispatch , switch / case , pattern matching and multiple dispatch .
These concepts are not generally grouped together , but they should be .
They are used to solve similar problems , albeit in very different ways .
Single dispatch
Let me start with single dispatch .
In Java , methods can be selected based on the type of the object they are invoked on .
All the Java. next languages support single dispatch , too :
; clojure ( fly vehicle speed ) // Java , Groovy , or Scala vehicle .
fly ( speed ) # ruby vehicle .
fly speed
In all of these languages , the actual implementation of fly can vary depending on the run-time type of vehicle .
( Clojure also supports multiple dispatch , where the implementation can vary based on the type of speed – more on that later . )
Better switching
Another way to dynamically choose behavior is with a switch statement .
Java has a simple switch statement , based on its historical kinship with C and C ++.
Switch statements have gotten a bad name , so much so that programmers are encouraged to replace them with polymorphism where possible .
This anti-switching bias is based on the limited kind of switching allowed in languages such as Java .
In Java.next , there is a different story .
The Java. next languages all have powerful switching capabilities , allowing you to switch on any criteria you like .
As an example , consider a method that calculates a letter grade , taking input that is either a number or letter grade .
Ruby 's case statement
Here is letter_grade in Ruby :
def letter_grade ( val ) case val when 90 .. 100 : ' A ' when 80 ... 90 : ' B ' when 70 ... 80 : ' C ' when 60 ... 70 : ' D ' when 0 ... 60 : ' F ' when /[ ABCDF ] / i : val .
upcase else raise " Not a valid grade : #{ val } " end end
In Ruby , the switch / case variant is called case .
The Ruby when clause can take arbitrary expressions .
Above you see ranges and regular expressions side - by - side in the same case expression .
In general , the when clause expects objects that implement a well - known threequals method , === .
Many Ruby objects have sensible === implementations : ranges match numbers in the range , regular expressions match strings containing the regular expression , classes match instances of the class , etc .
But any object can implement === , so you can implement arbitrarily complex dispatch with Ruby case .
Groovy 's switch statement
Here is letterGrade in Groovy :
def letterGrade ( val ) { switch ( val ) { case 90 .. 100 : return ' A ' case 80 ..< 90 : return ' B ' case 70 ..< 80 : return ' C ' case 60 ..< 70 : return ' D ' case 0 ..< 60 : return ' F ' case ~ " [ ABCDFabcdf ] " : return val .
toUpperCase ( ) default : throw new IllegalArgumentException ( " Invalid grade : $ val " ) } }
In Groovy , the switch / case variant is called switch .
If you compare this code with JRuby , you will see minor syntactic differences :
Groovy switch keeps faith with Java , so you have to return or break out
keeps faith with Java , so you have to or out Groovy uses default where Ruby uses else .
where Ruby uses .
Groovy 's top - exclusive range uses ..< whereas Ruby 's uses ... .
whereas Ruby 's uses .
Groovy uses isCase instead of === .
( This is not visible in the code sample , but you would need it to test case matches individually . )
The general ideas are the same .
Both JRuby and Groovy provide far more powerful and general approaches than Java 's switch .
Clojure 's cond function
In clojure , as in many Lisps , you can switch on arbitrary functions using cond .
One possible approach to letter - grade would be :
( defn letter - grade [ grade ] ( cond ( in grade 90 100 ) " A " ( in grade 80 90 ) " B " ( in grade 70 80 ) " C " ( in grade 60 70 ) " D " ( in grade 0 60 ) " F " ( re-find # " [ ABCDFabcdf ] " grade ) ( .toUpperCase grade ) ) )
In Clojure , regular expressions look like # " ... " .
The in function above is not part of Clojure .
I wrote the code the way I wanted it to read , and then wrote this function :
( defn in [ grade low high ] ( and ( number ?
grade ) ( <= low grade high ) ) )
In Clojure , I probably would n't use a regular expression for the letter - matching step , but I wrote the example that way for symmetry with the others .
Clojure 's cond is just the tip of the iceberg .
Clojure - contrib includes a set of macros for other variants of switch / case , and later in this article I will demonstrate Clojure 's multiple dispatch .
Scala 's pattern matching
Scala 's pattern matching is a powerful generalization of the switch / case idiom in many programming languages .
Scala provides out of the box support for pattern matching on
constants
variables ( which can be used in the match result )
constructors
sequences
tuples
types
With pattern matching , implementing letterGrade is a snap :
val VALID_GRADES
= Set ( " A " , " B " , " C " , " D " , " F " ) def letterGrade ( value : Any ) :
String = value match { case x :
Int if ( 90 to 100 ) .contains ( x ) =>
" A " case x : Int if ( 80 to 90 ) .contains ( x ) =>
" B " case x : Int if ( 70 to 80 ) .contains ( x ) => " C " case x : Int if ( 60 to 70 ) .contains ( x ) => " D " case x : Int if ( 0 to 60 ) .contains ( x ) => " F " case x : String if VALID_GRADES ( x.toUpperCase ) => x . toUpperCase ( ) }
In this implementation , numeric grades and letter grades are both matched first by type .
Then , case expressions also allow a guard that limits possible matches to some condition .
So , for example , the first case above matches only if value is an Int ( type match ) and between 90 and 100 ( the guard ) .
Scala 's guard expressions are cool , but the combination of type + guard does not exactly parallel the other implementations of letterGrade , which rely on arbitrary predicates in case expressions .
Scala can do this too : Scala extractors allow you to create arbitrary patterns .
Here is one approach to letterGrade using extractors :
def letterGrade ( value : Any ) :
String = value match { case NumericA ( value ) =>
" A " case NumericB ( value ) => " B " case NumericC ( value ) => " C " case NumericD ( value ) => " D " case NumericF ( value ) => " F " case LetterGrade ( value ) => value }
Behind the scenes , NumericA and friends are objects that implement an unapply method to determine if and how a value should match the pattern .
A more complex example
Scala 's pattern matching is much more general than the letter grade example shows .
To see this , check out Daniel Spiewak 's series introducing Scala for Java programmers .
In Part 4 , he gives an example of pattern - matching working in conjunction with case classes , which I will explore below .
Scala 's case classes
Case classes offer several interesting properties when compared to regular classes :
Case classes automatically get a factory method , e.g. Foo ( 1 ) instead of new Foo(1 )
instead of Case classes automatically get reasonable implementations for toString , hashCode , and equals .
These properties are so useful that Scala programmers use case classes for all kinds of things .
But their true purpose is revealed in conjunction with patterns :
Case classes work directly with pattern matching , without having to write an extractor as in the previous example .
class Color ( val red :
Int , val green :
Int , val blue : Int ) case class Red ( r : Int ) extends Color ( r , 0 , 0 ) case class Green ( g : Int ) extends Color ( 0 , g , 0 ) case class Blue ( b : Int ) extends Color ( 0 , 0 , b ) def printColor ( c : Color ) = c match { case Red ( v ) => println ( " Red : " + v ) case Green ( v ) => println ( " Green : " + v ) case Blue ( v ) => println ( " Blue : " + v ) case col : Color => { print ( " R : " + col . red + " , " ) print ( " G : " + col . green + " , " ) println ( " B : " + col . blue ) } case null => println ( " Invalid color " ) }
The printColor method pattern - matches Red , Green , and Blue to provide special behavior for basic colors .
Because these are case classes we can capture the actual color value v .
All other colors fall through to a general Color , which prints a more generic message .
Clojure 's defmulti
Scala 's pattern - matching is a signature feature of the language .
How do the other Java . next languages compare ?
To implement printColor in Clojure , I begin by defining a structure to capture a color :
( defstruct color : red : green : blue )
Where the Scala example defined basic colors with case classes , in Clojure I can use functions :
( defn red [ v ] ( struct color v 0 0 ) ) ( defn green [ v ] ( struct color 0 v 0 ) ) ( defn blue [ v ] ( struct color 0 0 v ) )
Now for the fun part .
I will define a multimethod named color - string , which dispatches based on which basic colors are present in the color struct .
( defmulti color - string basic - colors - in )
basic - colors - in is a dispatch function that reports which colors have nonzero values :
( defn basic - colors - in [ color ] ( for [ [ k v ] color : when ( not= v 0 ) ] k ) )
Now I can define multiple implementations of color - string .
The basic syntax is
( defmethod method - name dispatch - value function - body )
So for the three pure colors , I can define color - string as
( defmethod color - string [ : red ] [ color ] ( str " Red : " ( : red color ) ) ) ( defmethod color - string [ : green ] [ color ] ( str " Green : " ( : green color ) ) ) ( defmethod color - string [ : blue ] [ color ] ( str " Blue : " ( : blue color ) ) )
I can also provide a catch - all implementation by specifying a dispatch - value of : default :
( defmethod color - string : default [ color ] ( str " Red : " ( : red color ) " , Green : " ( : green color ) " , Blue : " ( : blue color ) ) )
Multimethods are more powerful than polymorphic single dispatch in two important ways :
With polymorphic single dispatch , the dispatch function is always the type of the the first argument .
With multimethods , the dispatch function can be any arbitrary function , e.g. basic - colors - in above .
With polymorphic single dispatch , polymorphism is limited to the first parameter .
The dispatch function for a multimethod can look at all parameters , and vary based on any of them .
( This feature is not needed in the color - string example above , but see Runtime Polymorphism for an example . )
Like Scala 's pattern matching , Clojure 's defmulti provides an extremely powerful and extensible dispatch mechanism .
Accidently blue
Both the Scala and Clojure code above take special action for colors that are declared to be pure blue :
// Scala scala > printColor ( Blue ( 10 ) ) Blue : 10
; Clojure user= > ( color - string ( blue 10 ) ) " Blue : 10 "
What about colors that are not declared as blue , but are , nevertheless , purely blue .
These colors are accidentally blue :
// different result for accidental blues scala > printColor ( new Color ( 0 , 0 , 10 ) ) R : 0 , G : 0 , B : 10
; all blues equal user= > ( color - string ( struct color 0 0 10 ) ) " Blue : 10 "
The Scala example was written to dispatch based on type , so it treats accidentally blue colors different from " real " Blue s. The Clojure example , on the other hand , dispatches based on the actual color values , so all solid blues are treated the same , no matter how they are created .
Of course , nothing stops me from " fixing " the Scala example , e.g. by dispatching on something other than type :
case class Color ( val red : Int , val green :
Int , val blue : Int ) object ColorDemo { def colorString ( c : Color ) = c match { case Color ( r , 0 , 0 ) =>
" Red : " + r case Color ( 0 , g , 0 ) =>
" Green : " + g case Color ( 0 , 0 , b ) =>
" Blue : " + b case col : Color => { " R : " + col . red + " , " + " G : " + col . green + " , " + " B : " + col .
blue } case null =>
" Invalid color " case null => " Invalid color " } }
Or , I could " break " the Clojure example by adding a type tag , and dispatching on that instead .
Rich Hickey posted this example on the Clojure mailing list :
( defstruct color : red : green : blue ) ( defn color - class [ name r g b ] ( assoc ( struct color r g b ) : tag name ) ) ( defn red [ v ] ( color - class : red v 0 0 ) ) ( defn green [ v ] ( color - class : green 0 v 0 ) ) ( defn blue [ v ] ( color - class : blue 0 0 v ) ) ( defmulti color - string : tag ) ( defmethod color - string :red [ c ] ( str " Red : " ( : red c ) ) ) ( defmethod color - string : green [ c ] ( str " Green : " ( : green c ) ) ) ( defmethod color - string : blue [ c ] ( str " Blue : " ( : blue c ) ) ) ( defmethod color - string : default [{ : keys [ red green blue ] } ] ( str " Color , R : " red " , G : " green " , B : " blue ) )
This version now works like the original Scala version , treating " accidental " blue differently from things marked with a : tag of : blue .
Note that multimethods are open .
I can add new colors later without having to modify the existing code :
( defn orange [ r g ] ( color - class : orange r g 0 ) ) ( defmethod color - string : orange [{ : keys [ red green ] } ] ( str " Orange , R : " red " , G : " green ) )
Dynamic Scala ?
If you are a dynamic language programmer fearing the tyranny of the Scala compiler , pattern matching is a cause for rejoicing .
With pattern matching , you can bypass static typing and get the flexibility of much more dynamic dispatch .
Consider : Scala 's pattern matching can be used to dispatch on arbitrary predicates .
These predicates are not limited to type relationships known at compile time , so a Scala program that uses pattern matching as the cornerstone of its dispatch strategy can be as dynamic as an extremely dynamic Ruby program .
Put another way : Scala 's catch - all match default ( _ ) is the moral equivalent of Ruby 's method_missing .
Conclusions
Dispatch takes many forms .
Single dispatch , switch statements , pattern matching , and multiple dispatch all meet similar needs : Selecting runtime behavior in response to varying runtime conditions .
Flexible dispatch is a key element of Java. next .
All of the Java . next languages support dispatch strategies that are far more flexible than Java 's single dispatch .
These strategies are not perfectly interchangeable , but have a great degree of overlap .
For example , Clojure 's multimethods and Scala 's pattern matching look quite different on the surface but can be used to solve similar problems .
Dispatch can be based on criteria more dynamic than the type system , even in Scala .

TOKYO , Dec 29 ( Reuters ) - Japan's Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and NEC Corp 6701.T will invest at least $ 1.1 billion to make lithium - ion batteries for about 200,000 electric and hybrid cars annually in 2011 or later , the Nikkei business daily said on Monday .
Nissan , NEC and NEC Tokin Corp 6759 .
T have a joint venture to start manufacturing lithium - ion batteries from next year .
It will have an initial capacity to supply 13,000 units a year , which will be first be used in forklifts .
The companies have said they plan to ramp up annual capacity gradually to supply 65,000 units in 2011 for use in Nissan ’s in - house hybrid car and electric vehicles due in 2010 .
The Nikkei said , without citing sources , that Nissan and NEC had decided to bring the plan forward , building a new factory in Japan in 2011 or later .
A spokesman at NEC said the venture was considering further investment and capacity expansion but no specific figure had been decided .
No one at Nissan , Japan ’s third - biggest carmaker , could be reached for comment .
Shares in NEC Corp jumped 6.3 percent , NEC Tokin soared 15 percent and Nissan inched up 0.6 percent by the end of morning trade , all outperforming a slight fall in the broader market .
. TOPX
The venture , Automotive Energy Supply Corp ( AESC ) , is also considering setting up factories in the United States and Europe in a bid to tap low - interest loans offered by local governments for the production of environmentally friendly vehicles , the paper said .
The battery joint venture had said in May it would invest 12 billion yen over three years to manufacture lithium - ion batteries , seen as key to making electric cars practical .
[ ID :nT367855 ]
Nissan is developing electric vehicles with French partner Renault SA RENA .
PA .
A top Renault executive told Reuters in October that the Nissan - NEC venture was considering producing the batteries in France to supply its first electric vehicles .
[ ID :nL1715724 ]
AESC also aims to supply other vehicle makers in what promises to become a competitive field .
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.
T both have their own joint ventures to develop and produce lithium - ion batteries .
Honda Motor Co 7267.T this month announced a joint venture with GS Yuasa Corp 6674.T -- also Mitsubishi Motors ' partner -- to produce and sell lithium - ion batteries mainly for hybrid cars .
While demand for cars falters around the world , automakers are looking to speed up the roll - out of next - generation vehicles to sharpen their competitive edge .
AESC is held 51 percent by Nissan , 42 percent by NEC and 7 percent by NEC Tokin .

But you do n't have to click through menus to open a new tab ; instead , just press Ctrl - T to view a blank page on a new tab , with the cursor in the address bar .
To have a link open in a new tab , either right - click the link and select Open Link in New Tab ( see screen at left ) , or highlight it and click the mouse wheel .
Also , you can have links that would normally launch a new browser window open instead in a new tab : Select Tools , Options , click the Tabs icon , choose a new tab ( as shown in the screen at right ) , and then click OK .
To move between tabs with the keyboard , press Ctrl - Tab to open the tab to the right , or Ctrl - Shift - Tab to go left .
Or reorder your tabs by dragging them with your mouse .
You can also download Firefox 's FLST 0.8.6 extension , which lets you toggle between two tabs by pressing Ctrl -+.
To close all but one of your open tabs , right - click the one you want to keep open and select Close Other Tabs .
If you accidentally close the wrong tab , press Ctrl - Shift - T to bring it back .
Given that Russia has shied away from making any changes to its constitution since it was enacted in 1993 , eyebrows were raised at the haste with which so momentous a reform was broached .
Over the eight years that Mr Putin was president , he consolidated his grip on power by abolishing regional elections for governors and neutering pressure groups , the media and parliament itself .
But each time , the Kremlin was careful to go through the motions of democracy , with long debates preceding each clampdown .
Statistical Analysis and A / B Testing
In this article we 're going to talk about how hypothesis testing can tell you whether your A/B tests actually effect user behavior , or whether the variations you see are due to random chance .
First , if you have n't yet , read my previous introductory article on hypothesis testing .
It explains the statistical principles behind hypothesis testing using the example of a biased coin .
We 're going to move quickly beyond that and dive right into A/B testing .
Landing Page Conversion
You 're testing a landing page that has a signup form .
You want to test various layouts to try and maximize the percentage of people who sign up .
This percentage is called the " conversion rate , " i.e. , the rate at which you convert visitors from passerbys to customers .
You have a four - way experiment with a control treatment and three experimental treatments .
How you pick your treatments is a subject worth discussing in its own right , but they should try to move the big levers : copy , layout , and size .
For this experiment we 'll just call the treatments control , A , B , and C .
You can use your imagination .
Fake Data
Your totally awesome Project X is attracting users .
You 've analyzed your sales pipeline and the point with the highest potential impact is the landing page .
You want increase the landing page conversion rate by at least 20 % .
You create an A/ B test with four treatments : control , A , B , and C .
Here is the data you collect :
Project X Landing Page Treatment Visitors Treated Visitors Registered Conversion Rate Control 182 35 19.23 % Treatment A 180 45 25.00 % Treatment B 189 28 14.81 % Treatment C 188 61 32.45 %
From the data both treatments A and C show at least a 20 % improvement in the landing page performance , which was our goal .
You might declare Treatment C " good enough , " choose it , and move on .
But how do you know the variation is n't due to random chance ?
What if instead of 188 visitors treated we only had 10 visitors treated ?
Would you still be so confident ?
As usual we 're aiming for a 95 % confidence interval .
Hypothesis testing is all about quantifying our confidence , so let 's get to it .
The Statistics
Remember , we need to start with a null hypothesis .
In our case , the null hypothesis will be that the conversion rate of the control treatment is no less than the conversion rate of our experimental treatment .
Mathematically
H_0 : p - p_c \le 0
where p c is the conversion rate of the control and p is the conversion rate of one of our experiments .
The alternative hypothesis is therefore that the experimental page has a higher conversion rate .
This is what we want to see and quantify .
The sampled conversion rates are all normally distributed random variables .
It 's just like the coin flip , except instead of heads or tails we have " converts " or " does n't convert . "
Instead of seeing whether it deviates too far from a fixed percentage we want to measure whether it deviates too far from the control treatment .
Here 's an example representation of the distribution of the control conversion rate and the treatment conversion rate .
The peak of each curve is the conversion rate we measure , but there 's some chance it is actually somewhere else on the curve .
Moreover , what we 're really interested in is the difference between the two conversion rates .
If the difference is large enough we conclude that the treatment really did alter user behavior .
So , let 's define a new random variable
X = p - p_c
H_0 : X \le 0
then our null hypothesis becomes
We can now use the same techniques from our coin flip example , using the random variable X .
But to do this we need to know the probability distribution of X .
It turns out that the sum ( or difference ) of two normally distributed random variables is itself normally distributed .
You can read the gory mathematical details yourself , if you 're interested .
This gives us a way to calculate a 95 % confidence interval .
Z-scores and One- tailed Tests
Mathematically the z - score for X is
z = \frac{p - p_c}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p) }{N} + \ frac{p_c(1-p_c ) }{N_c}}}
c
where N is the sample size of the experimental treatment and Nis the samle size of the control treatment .
Why ?
Because the mean of X is p - p c and the variance is the sum of the variances of p and p c .
In the coin flip example the 95 % confidence interval corresponded to a z - score of 1.96 .
But it 's different this time .
In the coin flip example we rejected the null hypothesis if the percentage of heads was too high or too low .
The null hypothesis there was
p = 0.50
X \le 0
but in this case our null hypothesis is
In other words , we only care about the positive tail of the normal distribution .
Here 's a graphical representation of what I 'm talking about .
In the coin example we have and we reject the null hypothesis if the percentage heads is too high or too low .
In this example we only reject the null hypothesis if the experimental conversion rate is significantly higher than the control conversation rate , so we have
That is , we can reject the null hypothesis with 95 % confidence if the z - score is higher than 1.65 .
Here 's a table with the z - scores calculated using the formula above :
Project X Landing Page Treatment Visitors Treated Visitors Registered Conversion Rate Z-score Control 182 35 19.23 % N/ A Treatment A 180 45 25.00 % 1.33 Treatment B 189 28 14.81 % - 1.13 Treatment C 188 61 32.45 % 2.94
Conclusions
From the table above we are safe concluding that Treatment C did , in fact , outperform the control treatment .
Whether the performance of Treatment A is statistically significant is irrelevant at this point because we know the performance of Treatment C is , so we should just pick that one and move on with our lives .
Here are the key take - aways :
The conversion rate for each treatment is a normally distributed random variable
We want to measure the difference in performance between a given treatment and the control .
The difference itself is a normally distributed random variable .
Since we only care if the difference is greater than zero we only need a z - score of 1.65 , corresponding to the positive half of the normal curve .
Statistical significance is important for A / B testing because it lets us know whether we 've run the test for long enough .
In fact , we can ask the inverse question , " How long do I need to run an experiment before I can be certain if one of my treatments is more than 20 % better than control ? "
This becomes more important when money is on the line because it lets you quantify risk , minimizing the impact of potentially risky treatments .
We 'll cover these things in future articles .
Until then !

The rumors that spread shortly after 9/11 have been passed on so often that people no longer know where or when they first heard them .
At this point , they have heard them so often , even on television , that they think they must be true .

First among these is that Jews did not go to work at the World Trade Center on that day .
Asked how Jews might have been notified to stay home , or how they kept it a secret from co-workers , people here wave off the questions because they clash with their bedrock conviction that Jews are behind many of their troubles and that Western Jews will go to any length to protect Israel .
“ Why is it that on 9/11 , the Jews did n’t go to work in the building , ” said Ahmed Saied , 25 , who works in Cairo as a driver for a lawyer .
“ Everybody knows this .
I saw it on TV , and a lot of people talk about this . ”
Zein al - Abdin , 42 , an electrician , who was drinking tea and chain - smoking cheap Cleopatra cigarettes in Al Shahat , a cafe in Bulaq , grew more and more animated as he laid out his thinking about what happened on Sept. 11 .
“ What matters is we think it was an attack against Arabs , ” he said of the passenger planes crashing into American targets .
“ Why is it that they never caught him , bin Laden ?
How can they not know where he is when they know everything ?
They do n’t catch him because he has n’t done it .
What happened in Iraq confirms that it has nothing to do with bin Laden or Qaeda .
They went against Arabs and against Islam to serve Israel , that ’s why . ”
There is a reason so many people here talk with casual certainty  and no embarrassment  about the United States attacking itself to have a reason to go after Arabs and help Israel .
It is a reflection of how they view government leaders , not just in Washington , but here in Egypt and throughout the Middle East .
They do not believe them .
The state - owned media are also distrusted .
Therefore , they think that if the government is insisting that bin Laden was behind it , he must not have been .
“ Mubarak says whatever the Americans want him to say , and he ’s lying for them , of course , ” Mr. Ibrahim said of Hosni Mubarak , Egypt ’s president .
" It is easy to spot pretty girls because they have big earrings , fancy dresses and all the jewelry , " he writes in Chapter Three .
" Pretty girls are like cars that need a lot of oil . "
He advises , " The best choice for most boys is a regular girl .
Remember , some pretty girls are coldhearted when it comes to boys .
Do n't let them get to you . "
He believes the best way to approach a girl is to keep it to a simple " hi . "
" If I say hi and you say hi back , we 're probably off to a good start , " he said .
As for his own love life , he said he is not dating anyone at the moment .
" I 'm a little too young , " he confessed .

This bird 's - eye view of Kutztown University in Pennsylvania was the first image ever seen by the GeoEye - 1 , the world 's highest - resolution commercial satellite sponsored by Google , when it opened its camera door earlier this week .
The
4,300 - pound satellite collected the image at noon EDT on Oct. 7 while moving from the north pole to the south pole in a 423 - mile - high orbit at 17,000 miles per hour , or 4.5 miles per second .
The spacecraft can take photos at a resolution of up to 41 cm
\– close enough to zoom in on the home plate of a baseball diamond , according to Mark Brender , GeoEye 's vice president of communications and marketing .
Even though the GeoEye - 1 satellite sports a colorful Google sticker , its key customer is actually not Google but rather the National Geospatial - Intelligence
Agency , a U.S. government agency that analyzes imagery in support of national security .
The NGA is paying for half of the development of the $ 502 million satellite and has committed to purchasing imagery from it .
Google is GeoEye 's second major partner .
" This is the opposite of a spy satellite , " Brender said in a phone interview .
" Spies do n't put info on the internet and sell imagery .
We 're an Earth - imaging satellite , and we can sell our imagery to customers around the world who have a need to map and measure and monitor things on the ground . "
Since around the late 70s , the military has used high - resolution spy satellites capable of reading newspaper headlines in Red Square .
But only in recent years the technology became available to the public and businesses while concurrently making dramatic strides in coverage and resolution .
For example , when Google Earth launched in 2004 , its imagery was low - res and spotty .
But by March 2006 , a third of the world population could get a bird 's - eye view of their own homes in high resolution .
There 's one catch for Google :
While the GeoEye - 1 will provide imagery to the NGA at the maximum resolution of 43 cm , Google will only receive images at a 50 - cm resolution because of a government restriction , Brender explained .
However , Google 's partnership with GeoEye is exclusive , meaning the search - engine giant will be the only online mapping site using the satellite 's photos .
" We 're commercializing a technology that was once only in the hands of the governments , " Brender said .
" Just like the internet , just like GPS , just like telecom – all invented by the government .
And now we are on the front end of the spear that is commercializing this technology . "
Considered the world 's most - accurate commercial imaging satellite , the GeoEye - 1
had been undergoing calibration and inspection since it was launched on
Sept. 6 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California .
A second satellite , GeoEye - 2 , slated to launch in 2011 or 2012 , will have a resolution of 25 cm , company representatives promised .
However , Google 's satellite imagery will not likely get more detailed because of the 50 - cm regulation .

From the comments :
This is an atrocity .
Obama is now Jesus , or Moses , or something else McCain is not .
I was actually Laughing Out Loud at how stupid the ad was .
Can I hear an OMFG ?
McCain has nothing .
Remember the attack line Conservatives used , Bush Derangement Syndrome ?
Can we start an Obama Derangement Syndrome meme ?
McCain ’s ads have not focused one iota on what McCain will do as president – except prolong a war and make tax cuts permanent ( which I am totally for – in peacetime . )
They ’re completely focused on Barack Obama and how popular he is .
It ’s quite funny when you think about it .
McCain is grasping , big time .
Oh , and from the comments as well , Bush or Batman – equally as funny !

The Joy of Walking
Do you ever reach a point in the day when you feel like you just ca n’t think anymore ?
Do you want to exercise more during the week but find it inconvenient to do so ?
Are you too tired and stressed to hit the gym or go running after work ?
If so , consider taking a walk .
Even though walking may seem slow and not painful enough to bring you any real benefits , walking is an activity that is not only beneficial , but can provide several benefits at once .
Next time you need a break or some exercise , take a walk .
Not everything needs to be punishment .
Walking is Good Exercise
It ’s not going to put you in the same kind of shape as an Olympic athlete , but if you are someone looking for a general level of fitness and the health benefits that come along with that , walking is a great activity .
For instance , if you went out for a walk on your lunch break at work and walked at a moderate pace ( 3 mph ) on a level surface , you would burn 136 calories ( for a 130 lb person ) .
How many calories do you burn if you meant to go running , but were too tired to go ?
Walking is Convenient
One of my favorite things about walking is that it does not require me to change my clothes ( if I ’m walking at a light / moderate pace ) .
This makes it a great activity to do at work or any other time when I have a spare 15 minutes .
Also , walking can be done in a lot of settings .
You can walk outside around your office building , you can walk in the mall , you can walk up stairs , or you can walk to the store .
Not to mention that your feet are actually a form of transportation .
If you live in an area that supports it , walking to get to where you need to go kills two birds with one stone .
Walking Brings Peace of Mind and Great Insights
If you are looking for a mental break in your daily routine , walking is peaceful and relaxing .
If you are walking outside – which I highly recommend as much as possible – being around nature has a way of changing your perspective .
That project that you are worried about , the one that you have no idea how to get started on , it suddenly seems much clearer to you .
Walking is also used as a form of meditation .
I do n’t know why it works , but when you are alone and moving on autopilot ( hopefully you do n’t have to think about putting one foot in front of the other ) creative thoughts and insights just seem to come to you .
“ All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking . ” Friedrich Nietzsche
Last Thoughts …
If you are a runner and you love to run and you find it beneficial , then do n’t stop .
But , if you are a runner and you find yourself making excuses for why you ca n’t ( read : do n’t want to ) run or you hate running to begin with or you ’re just looking for some peace and calm , consider walking .
You can burn calories , spend time in nature , and become more mindful all at the same time while taking a break from work .
No pain , all gain .

Rebecca Traister 's piece for Salon on the " momification " of Michelle Obama deals with the idea that this accomplished lawyer , who has her own , very strong identity , is now a woman who will be picking out dresses to wear to the inaugural ball and finding schools for her daughters .
Traister writes : " The Associated Press wondered what kind of first lady Michelle will be , and concludes , ' the kind of first lady this country has not seen in decades . '
You mean , the kind with a high - powered job ?
No , ' the mother of young children . ' "
Traister insists we do n't forget :
Prior to Hillary Clinton , we 'd never had a first lady who had a post - graduate degree .
Michelle Obama went to college at Princeton and law school at Harvard .
She was a practicing lawyer at the Chicago firm Sidley Austin when she was assigned to mentor the summer associate who would become her husband .
She was his mentor .
And when Barack writes of first meeting her , in The Audacity of Hope , he notes that " she was part of the intellectual property group and specialized in entertainment law ...
Michelle was full of plans that day , on the fast track , with no time , she told me , for distractions — especially men . "
Advertisement
How must it feel to put all that ambition on the back burner ?
What is it like to go , in other people 's eyes , from mentor to " mom " ?
A piece in the New York Times notes that Michelle Obama has " only a certain amount of patience for the domestic arts .
She is a get - it - done efficiently Rachael Ray type , they say , not given to elaborate Martha Stewart - like efforts . "
Traister replies , " Hey , here 's a crazy idea , but what if Michelle is a type of woman — and therefore a type of first lady — whose professional success has nothing to do with cooking or crafting ? "
And truly , her story is like that of so many working women who find themselves mothers , or who find that their career , for whatever reason , takes a backseat to that of their husband's .
Traister questions : " Why is there so little curiosity about how Michelle will adjust to the loss of her own private , very successful , very high - profile and very independent identity ?
How will Michelle Obama feel as she becomes what she has long resisted — an extension of her husband ? "

Mr Singh said at first he thought it was a practical joke .
A shop owner has been told by police to withdraw a leaflet advertising his Christmas drink offers because jokes on it were too racy .
Bob Singh has also put signs in the windows of his two Port Talbot stores apologising to anyone who took offence .
He said police over - reacted after three officers called to see him and he said he was warned he could be arrested .
South Wales Police said Mr Singh was given " appropriate advice " as the jokes were " potentially offensive . "
For the last 10 years Mr Singh has included jokes on his festive flyers which are delivered door to door .
Some of the jokes included references to overweight people , stereotypes and sexual innuendo .
" Someone went into one of the stores and said they did not find the jokes at all funny and stormed out , " he said .
" The staff said they had never seen her as a customer .
" The following day three police officers turned up in a riot van - I was not here and they spoke to my wife .
" At first she thought it was a practical joke but the officers said they were taking it very seriously . "
Mr Singh said his wife was told to withdraw all the leaflets .
Some of the less racy jokes
What 's the difference between a Welsh woman and a Welsh goddess ? -
An eight pack of Stella from Bob's
Why is it dangerous to let a bloke 's mind wander ? -
It 's too little to be out on its own
What is the technical name for three days of horrendous weather followed by bright sunshine ?
A Welsh bank holiday " The police have not told us which jokes were offensive or given us any guidance .
" Next year am I going to have to go to the police to get them to check them ? "
Mr Singh said he had found the jokes on the internet .
" I 'm a British born national but my parents are from India so they [ the jokes ] are not going to be racist , " he added .
He said " the world had gone crazy " and " political correctness had gone too far . "
" We 've had incidents of theft and violence in the stores and in general the response time is about a day or two . "
Mr Singh said he had yet to speak to a customer who had found the leaflets offensive and said now people were calling in just to try and get hold of one .
Customers at the Landmark Store in Water Street have been signing a petition in support of Mr Singh .
" You always get one troublemaker , " said one .
" Crazy " said another .
South Wales Police said one officer , along with a support officer and a trainee support officer had attended .
" The content of the promotional material which has been distributed has been brought to our attention as being potentially inflammatory and offensive , " said the force .
" The distributor has been appropriately advised and instructed to withdraw the leaflets from circulation . "

The congressional push to help U.S. automakers was generally cast in terms of protecting the reeling national economy from another body blow -- the collapse of one or more of Detroit ’s Big Three .
But in killing the stopgap rescue plan worked out by President Bush and congressional Democrats , conservative Republicans -- many from right - to - work states across the South -- struck at an old enemy : organized labor .
“ If the [ United Auto Workers ] , which is perceived as one of the strongest unions in the country , can be put under control , that may send a message across the whole country , ” said Michigan State University professor Richard Block , a labor relations expert .
Such antipathy to unions was an undercurrent through the weeks of negotiations leading up to Thursday ’s Senate vote rejecting the plan .

Handing a defeat to labor and its Democratic allies in Congress was also seen as a preemptive strike in what is expected to be a major battle for the new Congress in January : the unions ’ bid for a so - called card check law that would make it easier for them to organize workers , potentially reversing decades of declining power .
The measure is strongly opposed by business groups .
“ This is the Democrats ’ first opportunity to pay off organized labor after the election , ” read an e-mail circulated Wednesday among Senate Republicans .
“ This is a precursor to card check and other items .
Republicans should stand firm and take their first shot against organized labor , instead of taking their first blow from it . ”
One of the leading opponents of the auto bailout , Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , said : “ Year after year , union bosses have put their interests ahead of the workers they claim to represent .
Congress never should have given these unions this much power , and now is the time to fix it . ”
Of course , for Democrats ’ part , they were fighting for one of their most loyal supporters in backing the $ 14 - billion bailout .

The UAW , which represents about 150,000 employees of the Big Three , delivered campaign contributions and foot soldiers to help elect Barack Obama president , especially in crucial states such as Michigan and Ohio .
What lent a bipartisan gloss to Senate Democrats ’ effort was the fact that party leaders had negotiated for days with the White House and made a string of concessions that toughened the bill and won active support from the Bush White House .
Sen. George V. Voinovich ( R - Ohio ) , a strong auto industry supporter , acknowledged that some of his colleagues simply did not want to help the UAW .
“ We have many senators from right - to - work states , and I quite frankly think they have no use for labor , ” he said .
“ Labor usually supports very heavily Democrats and I think that some of the lack of enthusiasm for this [ bailout ] was that some of them did n’t want to do anything for the United Auto Workers . ”

One major car dealer said conservatives let political ideology get in the way of protecting the country ’s interests .
“ Being a Republican myself , I feel very betrayed by the Republican Party right now , ” said Beau Boeckmann , vice president of Galpin Motors Inc. in North Hills .
Galpin has the nation ’s largest Ford dealership as well as lots where it sells eight other foreign and domestic brands .
The anti-union sentiment rose to the surface in the final desperate hours of negotiations .
Republicans insisted that the UAW agree to cut its wages to be competitive with foreign companies such as Honda , Toyota and BMW by a set date .
UAW officials and their Democratic allies balked , saying the autoworkers were being told to make sacrifices that had not been demanded of other industries receiving government bailouts .

“ We could not accept the effort by the Senate GOP caucus to single out workers and retirees for different treatment and to make them shoulder the entire burden of any restructuring , ” UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said , arguing the union had gone further than any other stakeholder in making concessions to help the companies avoid bankruptcy .
But DeMint argued that the unions had helped create Detroit ’s plight .
“ It is no coincidence that the healthy automakers in the United States are located in ‘ right - to - work ’ states and are not unionized by the UAW , ” he said .
“ Right - to - work ” states bar agreements between trade unions and employers making membership or payment of union dues or “ fees ” a condition of employment , either before or after hiring .
Rep. John D. Dingell ( D - Mich . ) , a labor ally , said Friday that Republican senators who opposed the bailout might have “ wanted to crush a longtime political rival , the United Auto Workers , ” without concern for the economic consequences .

Democrats lauded the UAW as a hero in the bailout process for agreeing to new concessions on top of major ones given in 2005 and 2007 .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) called the union “ courageous ” just before the House approved the bailout Wednesday .
But some Republicans framed the UAW as the villain , criticizing what they called lavish wages and benefits that they said had driven General Motors , Chrysler and , to a lesser extent , Ford to their knees .
“ I ’m sure that I ’m going to be asked , ‘ Congressman , I work at Honda ’ or ‘ I work at Mercedes .
I get $ 40 an hour .
Why are you going to take my tax dollars and pay it to a company that ’s paying their employees $ 75 an hour ? ’ ” Rep. Spencer Bachus ( R - Ala . ) said last month .
That wage figure -- widely used by opponents of the auto industry bailout -- is not in fact the wage paid to current workers .
It is an approximation of the costs of salaries and benefits for current and retired workers .
After wage concessions in recent contracts , the UAW says its workers at GM , Ford and Chrysler plants range from $ 33 an hour for skilled trades to $ 14 an hour for new hires .

Precise wages and extrapolated benefits costs for U.S. workers at nonunionized foreign companies , such as Honda and Toyota , are difficult to ascertain , but Block estimated salaries for current workers are approximately the same .
The Big Three automakers have higher labor costs primarily because they have operated factories in the U.S. much longer than their foreign counterparts , so have many more retirees receiving pension and healthcare payments , Block said .
Even if UAW workers at GM took a 20 % pay cut , it would only save the company about $ 1.1 billion annually because the company ’s unionized workforce in the United States has decreased dramatically in recent years , to 55,000 , he said .
Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) characterized the GOP opposition as “ class - warfare assault by the Republicans . ”

“ They never ask about banker salaries .
. . .
They never asked they give money back , ” he said .
When Congress convenes in January , the expanded Democratic majorities are expected to push for an Employee Free Choice Act , also known as the “ card check , ” under which companies would recognize unions if a majority of workers signed cards saying they favored a union .
That would replace the traditional method of a secret ballot among workers .
Block and other analysts believe the looming fight added to the political maneuvering over the bailout .
“ The opposition might be as strong , but it might not be as urgent , ” Block said .

“ If the public could be convinced the problem with the auto industry is the UAW . . . then it will be easier than otherwise to marshal public support against unions and their legislative agenda . ”

Click to Type
Typing on the Storm is n't much fun , either .
You have to click the screen keyboard for each keystroke ( the keys flash blue under your fingertips as you click ) , which ends up feeling like a lot of work in a way that typing on a hardware keyboard ( or on the iPhone 's software keyboard , for that matter ) never did .
I worry , too , about how well the mechanics of the click screen will hold up under the pressure of continual use by heavy typers .
There 's no obvious way to make the keyboard go away quickly , either , if you want to see part of the screen that it 's concealing .
I did appreciate the Storm 's use of RIM 's excellent SureType predictive text entry ; and the decision to go , in portrait mode , with the 20 - key QWERTY layout used on the BlackBerry Pearl 8120 and other narrow BlackBerry handsets was probably a good one ( especially for users contemplating a migration from a Pearl ) .
However , RIM made one extremely annoying data - entry decision :
When you enter a number , you press a key to access the numerals -- but after each entry , the keyboard returns to the default QWERTY design , so you have to tap twice for each digit you enter ( once to access the number keypad , and again to designate the desired digit ) .
This may be an artifact of the way RIM 's hardware keyboards work ( typically , you have to hold down an ALT or similar key to enter numbers ) -- but when translated to software , it 's a disaster .
[ Note : After this review went live , a reader noted that you can in fact type several numbers in succession without having to go to the alphabetical keyboard by holding down the key for accessing the number keypad for several seconds , which essentially locks it in .
The manual explains this , but the capability was n't intuitively apparent .
However I still think the alternative approach of having the number keypad remain accessible by default would have been better . ]
Elusive Browser Navigation Controls
A larger screen always enhances Web browsing , but I found the Storm difficult to use because it lacks on - screen back / forward keys .
To go back , you may either press the escape key or press the menu key and then select ' back ' , but I never found a way to move forward .
The on - screen controls let you bring up an address bar , switch between page and column views ( a feature that did n't help much on sites that identified the Storm as a mobile device ) , and zoom in and out on a page .
Unfortunately , selecting and clicking did not make for a great Web browsing experience .
Where touch was n't a major issue , the Storm functioned well .
Phone call quality was solid , and Verizon Wireless probably should get some credit for this :
The Storm maintained calls that the iPhone and AT&T Wireless dropped in the same location , to the same number , at the same time of day .
I was very impressed by the audio quality of MP3 files that I listened to through the bundled earbuds , and a video movie trailer that came on my device looked pretty good .
RIM says that its screen responds to lighting conditions , and I believe it : Whereas the iPhone can look dim outdoors , the Storm never did .
The Storm 's camera certainly outshines the iPhone 's , not only in megapixel count , but with regard to its autofocus and flash .
The GPS worked well , too , both with a simple maps / written directions app and with Verizon 's optional fee - based VZ Navigator service .
The Storm also comes with Documents to Go productivity apps , and of course it provides RIM 's excellent support for corporate e-mail systems ( though setting up the desktop software on my PC and performing an initial sync took 20 to 30 minutes , longer than I had anticipated ) .
The Storm comes with an 8 GB microSD card ; and with that addition , it has as much total storage as the $ 199 iPhone ( if you take advantage of a $ 50 mail - in rebate for the Storm , the two handsets will be at price parity , too ) .
You get a concise printed manual , a card and pamphlet with information on global tech support , and plug adapters that enable you to recharge the device wherever you may roam .
But people who were hoping for a credible iPhone alternative fortified with BlackBerry 's strengths as a mobile tool for corporate travelers will likely find the Storm a disappointment .
When it comes to touch interfaces , Apple still has no peer .
[ Even before seeing the BlackBerry Storm , some journalists had reservations about it .

So I 've been programming with Python since 2001 and I 've never had the need to do anything that the standard import system did n't provide - until this week .
We are planning on a little code reorganization for a project at work in preparation for collaboration from more developers .
I wrote a simple custom importer / loader that let 's a developer write
from application .
widgets import foobar
instead of the longer
from application.widgets.foobar.widget import foobar
and the class foobar winds up in globals ( ) .
It 's not groundbreaking functionality but it actually does add a little clarity in our situation .
The whole task it was made quite simple by the features introduced in PEP 302 ( that document is a great reference ) .
Now , before anyone suggests that we could have just pulled the classes in via a __init__.py in the application / components directory , note that some components might depend on others which have not been imported and thus their imports would fail .
Anyhow , like I said , it is n't groundbreaking , but the very fact that you can customize Python 's import system is neat .
I got to thinking about what other ways I could hack the import system , and came up with a little web importer .
I 'll post the code below , only because I think it is a clever trick , not that it is something to use in development of a Real Application .
" " " Stupid Python Trick - import modules over the web .
Author : Christian Wyglendowski License : MIT ( http://dowski.com/mit.txt) " " " import httplib import imp import sys def register_domain ( name ) : WebImporter.registered_domains.add( name ) parts = reversed ( name.split( '.' ) ) whole = [ ] for part in parts : whole.append( part ) WebImporter.domain_modules.add ( " . " . join ( whole ) ) class WebImporter ( object ) : domain_modules = set ( ) registered_domains = set ( ) def find_module ( self , fullname , path =None ) : if fullname in self.domain_modules : return self if fullname.rsplit ( '.' ) [ 0 ] not in self .
domain_modules : return None try : r = self._do_request( fullname , method = " HEAD " ) except ValueError : return None else : r.close ( ) if r.status == 200 : return self return None def load_module ( self , fullname ) : if fullname in sys.modules : return sys.modules[fullname ] mod = imp.new_module( fullname ) mod.__loader__ = self sys.modules [ fullname ] = mod if fullname not in self .
domain_modules : url = " http://%s%s " % self._get_host_and_path( fullname ) mod.__file__ = url r = self._do_request( fullname ) code = r.read ( ) assert r.status == 200 exec code in mod.__dict__ else : mod.__file__ = " [ fake module %r ] " % fullname mod.__path__ = [ ] return mod def _do_request ( self , fullname , method = " GET " ) : host , path = self._get_host_and_path( fullname ) c = httplib .
HTTPConnection ( host ) c.request ( method , path ) return c.getresponse ( ) def _get_host_and_path( self , fullname ) : tld , domain , rest = fullname.split( '.' , 2 ) path = " /%s.py " % rest.replace ('.' , '/') return " . " . join ( [ domain , tld ] ) , path sys.meta_path = [ WebImporter ( ) ]
You can use it like so :
import webimport webimport.register_domain('dowski.com ' ) from com.dowski import test
That would fetch and import http://dowski.com/test.py .
There may be other Python libraries out there that do this better - I could n't find any with a quick Google search .
I can think of a number of features would be needed for a serious implementation of something like this ( caching , HTTP - AUTH , signatures , remote package support , etc ) .
For now though I 'm just throwing this out there because I think it is neat .
Anyone else doing neat tricks with the import hooks that Python exposes ?

Sitting at home minding my own business when I get a call from a Home Investor ( we buy ugly houses , etc ) wanting to buy our home !
I said why would you call us ... he says , because court records show your home in foreclosure !!!
We were shocked , checked the clerk of courts website , and sure enough , our name , address , and GMAC starting foreclosure proceedings !!
Calling GMAC got us nowhere .. call Mr Stern ( foreclosure mill attorney in South Fla ) .
We call there , leave voicemails , FINALLY get ahold of someone who says " we wo n't have your file until the end of next week , call back then !!!
We call GMAC back and FINALLY get ahold of someone who tells us what happened .
About 6 months earlier , we had made a .30 CENT error when we sent in a payment .
Because we were .30 short , our payment went into a " suspense file . "
Of course , the following month , after interest , penalties , etc , same thing ... suspense file .
During those 6 months my wife even called at least one payment in ... they said NOTHING !!!
We seldom received monthly statements , and never any during this period .
When we FINALLY go ahold of " Daniel " at Stern 's office , he was like most people we had talked to ... the " your just another deadbeat " attitude .
No one would listen to what happened , and did n't care .
However , they would settle for $ 6,000 in penalty and interest ... and lawyer fees , etc .
When we attempted to get a break down of all costs , we were put off , promised them , etc .. to this day , almost a year later , we have n't received it although they had been ordered to provide them twice by a judge .
We checked with some laywers , and were basically told , " your screwed " but would take our case , which would have probably cost us thousands more .
So we decided to fight it ourselves .
My wife searched the internet , got all the information and laws , kept a close eye on the clerk of the court website .
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!!
Twice the lawyer filed for " summery judgements " that we found out about on the website ... we were NEVER notifed by them !!!!
Several months into this of figuting , trying to work a settlement and begging for a breakdown of charges and fees , the lawyers office FINALLY told us to call the Loss Midigation Office !!
We were never told about them !!
GMAC would only refer us to the attorney !
Guess when they figured we would not just roll over , they gave us the number .
We contacted them , again very " you deadbeats " attitude , and set up payments they KNEW we could n't afford ( over twice what our regular payment should have been ) .
We were able to make those payments for 5 of the 6th scheduled months , but were 2 days late on the last one .
They returned it , added several more thousands in fees , and wanted to set up another of their so called " payment " plans .
We finally got a settlement figure from them ( GMAC ) ( although to this day STILL do n't know what all the fees were for ) then the lawyers office gave us another settlement figure for about $ 2500 MORE than GMAC .
They were trying to charge us for lawyer fees TWICE !!!!
I finally got the settlement money together , taking money from a retirement fund ( taxes will kill me next year for that ) !!!
We sent the money to GMAC and assumed it was over .
My wife kept checking the Clerk of Courts website waiting to see a dismissal .
A month after they received our check , she checked the website and again , Stern had filed another summary judgement for 2 days later , and we found that GMAC added $ 1600 in " fees " to the next months payment !!!
We went to court and the lawyer called in moments befoe the scheduled time to say they were dismissing the case .
The judge was NOT AMUSED by GMAC or the lawyers !!
He told us it was the worst case of abuse and incompetence he had ever seen , and would never had issued the summary judgement after reading our file , but would have scheduled it for trial .
After almost 2 weeks , we STILL can't find out what the $ 1600 in " fees " is for , although the judge did tell us to let him know if they did n't drop it .
We have been told there is apparently one person who knows , and several messages to her voice mail had been ignored , although she has our home and both cell phone numbers .
Yep , the 30 cents was our mistake .
There was a time when the company would have called or send a letter saying " ooops ... you made a mistake , please sent us 30 cents !!!
Not GMAC !!!
They are our to destroy people .
It will take years to get my credit report fixed ( they reported " foreclosure " to the credit agencies ) .
I would have happily paid the 30 cents plus 100 bucks in late fees , had they bothered to notify us .
We are like some others here .
I 'd refinance with another company in a second but first , with my credit report , the interest rate would be through the roof , and second , there is not guarentee that the company wo n't sell our note back to GMAC !!

Kid Rock and His Mystery Woman ( Photos )
has been in Berlin , Germany and was spotted leaving Felix club at 4:30 a.m .
He was in the company of a dark haired woman , singer , who was sporting a fur coat .
The pair reportedly headed back to Kid 's hotel .
Kid has been touring throughout the U.S. and Europe in 2008 promoting his album Rock N Roll Jesus and his highly successful single All Summer Long , which hit top spot in Austria , Australia , Germany , Ireland , The Netherlands , Sweden and the UK .
The album is certified double platinum in the U.S. and gold in Canada and Germany .
The singer has had his share of brawl episodes .
In 2005 he was arrested for assaulting DJ Jay Campos at a strip club .
He also made headlines when he rumbled with Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee in September 2007 at the MTV Video Awards show .
A month later he shook things up at a Waffle House in Atlanta .
That little fiasco got him 80 hours of community service and a course in anger management .
Kid was married to blonde bombshell Pamela Anderson from July 29 until November 27 , 2006 .
The scant four month marriage was said to have ended because he became enraged during a screening of Borat , where she made a cameo appearance .
Check out our photo gallery below .
We 've included photos of other women seen out and about with Kid Rock .

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , Cuba planted thousands of urban cooperative gardens to offset reduced rations of imported food .

Now , in the wake of three hurricanes that wiped out 30 percent of Cuba ’s farm crops , the communist country is again turning to its urban gardens to keep its people properly fed .
“ Our capacity for response is immediate because this is a cooperative , ” said Miguel Salcines , walking among rows of lettuce in the garden he heads in the Alamar suburb on the outskirts of Havana .
Salcines says he is hardly sleeping as his 160 - member cooperative rushes to plant and harvest a variety of beets that takes just 25 days to grow , among other crops .
As he talks , dirt - stained men and women kneel along the furrows , planting and watering on land next to a complex of Soviet - style buildings .
Machete - wielding men chop weeds and clear brush along the periphery of the field .
Around 15 percent of the world ’s food is grown in urban areas , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture , a figure experts expect to increase as food prices rise , urban populations grow and environmental concerns mount .
Since they sell directly to their communities , city farms do n’t depend on transportation and are relatively immune to the volatility of fuel prices , advantages that are only now gaining traction as “ eat local ” movements in rich countries .
ROOFTOPS AND PARKING LOTS
In Cuba , urban gardens have bloomed in vacant lots , alongside parking lots , in the suburbs and even on city rooftops .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
They sprang from a military plan for Cuba to be self - sufficient in case of war .
They were broadened to the general public in response to a food crisis that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union , Cuba ’s biggest benefactor at the time .
They have proven extremely popular , occupying 35,000 hectares ( 86,000 acres ) of land across the Caribbean island .
Even before the hurricanes , they produced half of the leaf vegetables eaten in Cuba , which imports about 60 percent of its food .
“ I do n’t say they have the capacity to produce enough food for the whole island , but for social and also agricultural reasons they are the most adequate response to a crisis , ” said Catherine Murphy , a U.S. sociologist who has studied Cuba ’s urban gardens .
GREEN PRODUCTIVITY
In Alamar , the members get a salary and share the garden ’s profits , so the more they grow , the more they earn .
They make an average of about 950 pesos , or $ 42.75 , per month , more than double the national average , Salcines said .
The co-op , which began in 1997 , now produces more than 240 tons of vegetables annually on its 11 hectares ( 27 acres ) of land , which is about the size of 13 soccer fields .
The gardens sell their produce directly to the community and , out of necessity , grow their crops organically .
“ Urban agriculture is going to play a key role in guaranteeing the feeding of the people much more quickly than the traditional farms , ” said Richard Haep , Cuba coordinator for German aid group Welthungerhilfe , which has supported these kinds of projects since 1994 .
When the Soviet Union fell apart , Cuba ’s supply of oil slowed to a trickle , hurting big state agricultural operations .
Chemical fertilizers were replaced with mountains of manure , and beneficial insects were used instead of pesticides .
Unlike in developed countries , where organic products are more expensive , in Cuba they are affordable .
“ We have taken organic agriculture to a social level , ” said Salcines .
Some experts fear that rising international food prices along with the destruction of the hurricanes will return Cuba to the path of agrochemicals .
The government is planning to construct a fertilizer plant with its oil - rich ally Venezuela .
But Raul Castro , who replaced ailing brother Fidel Castro as president in February , has also borrowed ideas from the urban gardens as he implements reforms to cut the island ’s $ 2.5 billion in annual food imports , much of it from the United States .
Castro has decentralized farm decision - making and raised the prices that the state pays for agricultural products , which has increased milk production , for example , by almost 20 percent .
And , in September , the government began renting out unused state - owned lands to farmers and cooperatives , measures that met with approval of international aid groups .
“ Decentralization and economic incentives .
If those elements are expanded to the rest of the agricultural sector , the response will be the same , ” said Welthungerhilfe ’s Haep .
Lorelei Shellist Autobiography Runway Runaway
Model and actresshas written an autobiography chronicling her journey from teenage runaway to runway model .
Runway Runaway " takes readers on a breathless journey around the globe with a backstage pass to high fashion , true romance , and rock and roll from some of the biggest names in the business . "
The book details Shellist 's life from a runaway at age 15 to the catwalks of Paris as a top model for designers such as Karl Lagerfeld , Yves St. Laurent , Christian Lacroix , Bob Mackie , Geoffrey Beene , Ralph Lauren , Gian Franco Ferre and Giorgio Armani .
Shellist was 24 when she met Def Leppard guitarist Steve Clark , whom she calls " the love of my life . "
Of their first meeting she writes , " Our attraction was surreal and intoxicating .
He had an ardor about him that reminded me of a peacock spreading its feathers .
It was love at first sight .
I did n’t know anything about him other than the fact that he played in an English rock group that had just been on tour in America . "
" At that moment " she says , " I could not have cared less if he were a street - sweeper ; something about him just stole my heart . "
Clark died of an accidental overdose in 1991 , which Shellist says was a result of " living on the other side of glamour . "
The book release date is November 25 .

Heat stroke ?
Forget the ice , says study
When it comes to cooling a heat stroke victim , forget the ice and immerse them in temperate water , new research suggests .
The research , by Associate Professor Nigel Taylor of the University of Wollongong and colleagues , appears in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise .
" Cooling in temperate water took only marginally longer than that in cold water , and one cannot imagine that the 45 [ second ] cooling difference would have any meaningful physiological or clinical implications , " Taylor and colleagues write .
From fun runners and cricketers , miners and soldiers , working out in the heat , especially in heavy protective clothing , can lead to dangerous overheating .
Sports scientist Dr Matt Brearley of the Northern Territory Institute of Sport says once a person 's core temperature reaches 39.5 °C to 40.5 °C they get hyperthermia .
" Most of the bodily processes will start to break down , " he says .
Brearley says people lose their ability to regulate blood flow properly and can even stop sweating .
This means they store more heat at the time when they most need to dissipate it .
And a person 's failure to control blood pressure generally leads to collapse , says Brearley .
" Then they 're in grave danger because they 're actually threatening their life , " he says .
The medical response to hyperthermia is to cool the body as quickly as possible by immersing the patient in cold water , of about 14°C .
But , say Taylor and colleagues , this may not always be practical .
" Access to ice or cold water may be limited in hot climates , " they write .
They also say that some experts suggest sudden cold - water immersion may actually shut down the blood supply to the skin and make it harder for heat to dissipate from the body .
Experiment
Taylor and colleagues wondered whether temperate water might be as effective in cooling people down .
They compared how long it took to cool an overheated person in temperate water as opposed to air , and cold water .
Their trial involved eight males who were heated to a temperature of 39.5 °C ( as measured by a sensor inserted into the oesophagus ) .
The men exercised in 36 °C and 50 % relative humidity while wearing a suit with 40 °C hot water pumping through it .
" That 's very uncomfortable , " says Brearley .
The researchers then compared how long it took the men to cool down in 20 - 22 °C air , 14 °C water and 26 °C water .
They found little difference between the effects of cold and temperate water .
Taylor and colleagues assume that the temperate water has a less drastic affect on the skin 's blood supply than cold water , and this compensates for the fact that it is not as cold .
Brearley agrees it would be more practical to use temperate water to cool people with hyperthermia , but he thinks it 's too early to recommend changes for heat stroke treatment .
" I 'd like to see some more data on this , " he says .
" It 's a starting point for further investigation . "
He says such findings may be particularly relevant to the survival of people suffering hyperthermia in remote areas , including miners and soldiers .
" Water has such a great cooling power compared to air , " says Brearley .
The researchers received defence funding for the new study .
The Scottish border town of Gretna Green has an influx of visitors , and not just the human kind .
It seems locals and tourists alike just can't get enough of watching millions of starlings converge on the sky on sunset as the birds search for a safe place to roost .
Hundreds of spectators have been treated to the amazing sunset display , which has left them mesmerised by the huge flock 's sweeping aerial acrobatics .
Drivers on the A74M , the main motorway between England and Scotland , have been stopping in their droves to witness the sight .
But the shear mass of birds is causing a distraction to commuters and truck drivers who are urged to take extra care when pulling over and parking to watch the display .
And while it may look like the birds are on a kamakazi mission , the logic behind their aerial acrobatics makes much more sense .
Every winter , the birds take to the skies after a long day spent feeding in nearby reed beds .
As they take flight during the last minutes of daylight , the starlings fly quick and fast in a bid to confuse waiting predators such as sparrowhawks and buzzards .
The tiny birds must converge , fly and sqwark , in an attempt to confuse their predators , reaching speeds of more than 20 mph , with few if any crashes .
Scientists say the secret behind their amazing spatial awareness is that each starling tracks seven other birds enabling the group 's cohesion .
The naturally occurring event is a spectacle which takes place only during the winter months .
Starling numbers have halved in the last 25 years and they are now red-listed as an endangered species .
Experts say the starlings are a mix of British and European birds and will leave for Russia in February and March .
Nature lover Jon Tait , 34 , said : ' It 's amazing to see the natural world like this .
The shapes and movements they make are beautiful - Hollywood special effects could n't make it more breathtaking .
' Whenever I get the train I have to dive undercover at the station when they come because they leave a bit of a mess , but it 's worth it to see them in the sky .

Alert …Elves Spotted
Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he was directly involved in approving severe interrogation methods used by the CIA , and that the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , should remain open indefinitely .
Cheney ’s remarks on Guantanamo appear to put him at odds with President Bush , who has expressed a desire to close the prison , although the decision is expected to be left to the incoming administration of President - elect Barack Obama .
Cheney ’s comments also mark the first time that he has acknowledged playing a central role in clearing the CIA ’s use of an array of controversial interrogation tactics , including a simulated drowning method known as waterboarding .
“ I was aware of the program , certainly , and involved in helping get the process cleared , ” Cheney said in an interview with ABC News .

Asked whether he still believes it was appropriate to use the waterboarding method on terrorism suspects , Cheney said : “ I do . ”
His comments come on the heels of disclosures by a Senate committee showing that high - level officials in the Bush administration were intimately involved in reviewing and approving interrogation methods that have since been explicitly outlawed and that have been condemned internationally as torture .
Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks , Cheney said , the CIA “ in effect came in and wanted to know what they could and could n’t do .
And they talked to me , as well as others , to explain what they wanted to do .
And I supported it . ”
Waterboarding involves strapping a prisoner to a tilted surface , covering his face with a towel and dousing it to simulate the sensation of drowning .

CIA Director Michael V. Hayden has said that the agency used the technique on three Al Qaeda suspects in 2002 and 2003 .
But the practice was discontinued when lawyers from the Department of Justice and other agencies began backing away from their opinions endorsing its legality .
Cheney has long defended the technique .
But he has not previously disclosed his role in pushing to give the CIA such authority .
Cheney ’s office is regarded as the most hawkish presence in the Bush administration , pushing the White House toward aggressive stances on the invasion of Iraq and the wiretapping of U.S. citizens .
Asked when the Guantanamo Bay prison would be shut down , Cheney said , “ I think that that would come with the end of the war on terror . ”
He went on to say that “ nobody can specify ” when that might occur , and likened the use of the detention facility to the imprisonment of Germans during World War II .

“ We ’ve always exercised the right to capture the enemy and hold them till the end of the conflict , ” Cheney said .
The administration ’s legal case for holding detainees indefinitely has been eroded by a series of court rulings .
Obama has pledged to close the facility , which still holds 250 prisoners .
Cheney ’s remarks are the latest in a series of interviews granted by Bush and senior officials defending their decisions as they prepare to leave office .
Bush recently said his main regret was that U.S. spy agencies had been so mistaken about Iraq ’s alleged weapons programs .
Cheney and the Bush administration have been accused of “ cherry - picking ” intelligence to support going to war with Iraq .
Cheney said that those mistakes did n’t matter , and that the U.S. invasion was justified by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein ’s ability to reestablish destructive weapons programs .
The vice president brushed off a series of findings questioning that view , including a 2006 Senate report concluding that Hussein lacked a “ coherent effort ” to develop nuclear weapons and had only a “ limited capability ” for chemical weapons .

“ This was a bad actor and the country ’s better off , the world ’s better off , with Saddam gone , and I think we made the right decision in spite of the fact that the original [ intelligence ] was off in some of its major judgments , ” he said .

Wi -Fi wireless Internet connectivity has become nearly ubiquitous .
Whether you 're at home , in a coffee shop , or even on some commercial airliners , you can get online with a Wi -Fi-equipped laptop , smart phone or portable game machine .
Now , Wi -Fi is making its way into your car .
A small California company , Autonet Mobile , has teamed up with Chrysler and others to sell a service that floods any brand or model of car or truck with Wi -Fi Internet connectivity that can be used by multiple passengers and devices simultaneously .
It 's a dealer - installed option on Chrysler vehicles , but Chrysler dealers , and some independent auto electronic shops , will install it on any brand of car for a fee .
The system works via a special wireless router , mounted in the trunk or rear cargo area , that draws Internet connectivity from cellphone towers and then converts it into an in - car Wi -Fi signal with a range of 100 feet .
This router looks like a military device , because it is ruggedized to survive jolts and vibrations , and is shielded to avoid interference with the car 's electronics or with cellphone calls .
As long as they have built - in Wi-Fi , the laptops and smart phones used in the car do n't need any add - on hardware or software to use Autonet .
To them , it looks like any other Wi -Fi signal .
And no special car antenna is needed ; the router uses its own large antennas .
The holiday season is always an exciting time for gamers .
This is the time of year when the best games are lining store shelves in mass quantities , the console manufacturers are putting together the best hardware deals of the year , and all the guns are ablaze in the glorious console war .
This year in particular is special , though , as both the PlayStation 3 and Wii are two years old this month , and the Xbox 360 is about to undergo a substantial refresh .
All three of the consoles have changed quite a bit since their respective launches .
More functionality is crammed into each one of these boxes than ever before — and at lower prices , to boot .
So what exactly are you getting beyond the bullet points on the back of the box ?
Let 's take a look at where the three consoles stand feature - wise this holiday .
Microsoft Xbox 360
As the oldest console in the line - up , the Xbox 360 has had the most time to mature and it shows .
As far as sheer functionality and modern conveniences go , the Xbox 360 is hard to beat , especially when you 're connecting your system to the Internet .
When the Xbox is made " Live , " it becomes a treasure trove of downloadable content , online multiplayer , and multimedia functionality .
And the " New Xbox Experience , " which is coming tomorrow , only strengths that .
The NXE is really the headlining feature of the Xbox 360 this year .
This new interface adds much more than just a coat of gloss to the aging Blades interface that has been around since the console launched in 2005 .
Microsoft has worked hard to make the interface simultaneously more attractive and easier to use , and the company 's hard work has paid off : the NXE is a big leap over the old interface , allowing users to install games to the hard drive , create parties of up to eight players with dedicated voice chat across all games , and more .
Other neat features of the interface include an improved game collection , which makes traversing through a thick library of Arcade titles a breeze ; the new Avatars system , which allows users to create Mii- cartoon - like characters to represent themselves online ; and the new Community Games initiative , which supplements the Xbox Live Arcade platform with games created by indie developers and moderated by the community rather than Microsoft itself .
Expect to see tons of original games flooding the service soon .
But gaming is n't the only area where the Xbox 360 excels .
It 's also an excellent media playback device , as well .
While the HD DVD add - on may have been a bust , the Xbox 360 is a very capable media center , with full support for Windows Media Center , as well as support for just straight old network sharing of audio , video , and picture files .
The Xbox 360 can quickly and easily stream DivX movies from your computer , provided the videos are encoded properly , or play MP3s from your portable media player .
And , with the NXE , American users now enjoy the full roster of NetFlix content ( in HD , no less ) in addition to a huge array of purchasable and rentable content from the hearty Xbox Live Video Marketplace .
Feature - wise , the Xbox 360 is stacked .
That makes it incredibly hard to believe that it is also now the cheapest console .
At a $ 200 price point with a $ 20 hard drive from Microsoft directly , the Xbox 360 is the most well - rounded and well - priced console on the market .
Sony PlayStation 3
Though the Xbox 360 would seem to be the prime candidate for " most improved console , " Sony 's PlayStation 3 handily steals that title — albeit thanks in large part to a rough launch .
Some might say that the system launched too early , but the fact of the matter is that today , on the cusp of the holiday shopping season , the PS3 is a force to be reckoned with .
Just about everything you could want from your console , and more , is ready and waiting in a newly - purchased PS3 .
While the PS3's online support is n't up to par with the Xbox 360 , the system has greatly advanced over the last year .
The long - awaited in - game Cross Media Bar support arrived this year ; this feature lets you access your friend 's list and adjust all kinds of settings while you 're in a game , which makes it much easier to organize games with your friends .
The new official Bluetooth headset has also arrived alongside a VOIP - quality voice chat firmware upgrade , which makes chatting on the PS3 a pleasure .
The PS3 also offers some nice online applications .
The Folding@Home client was updated this year to become Life With PlayStation , which offers news from around the world , weather updates , and a stunning HD overlay of the Earth , which begs to be left on your TV as a screensaver of sorts .
And a simple internet browser , which recently was updated with Flash 9 , rounds out the package .
Like the Xbox 360 , the PS3 is also a very accomplished media center .
Because of the roomy hard drive ( and the ability to easily swap out the preexisting one with any laptop - sized SATA disk ) , putting content on your unit or streaming it across your network is a must - do .
The PS3 supports DivX and Xvid as well as WMA and a host of audio and picture files with DLNA server support , so most of your video files should work fine .
There 's also a growing PlayStation Video Store for American users which features a ton of great content already ( though the DRM in place definitely needs some work ) .
One of the best features about the PS3 that few rarely discuss , and that has gotten better over the years , is the system 's ability to utilize virtually any third - party USB peripheral .
Any old Bluetooth or USB keyboard , headset , or what have you will likely work with the PS3 , and the firmware updates have quietly made it easier to identify what accessories are plugged in and keep profiles of your devices for later use .
And , of course , you can't talk about the PlayStation 3 without mentioning Blu - Ray .
The PS3 stands as one of the best Blu-ray players on the market , thanks in large part to the online connectivity .
Sony continues to upgrade Blu-ray playback with support for further Blu-ray features , including the recent addition of BD - Live functionality .
As far as high - class , all - in - one entertainment systems go , the PlayStation 3 is at the top of the list .
This is the Rolls Royce of video game consoles : it 's the most expensive , but it's also the most luxurious ride if you can afford it .
And with PlayStation Home on the horizon and a continued front of SDK improvements , Sony 's sleek system is aging like great wine .
Nintendo Wii
Though the system has n't changed as drastically as its peers , Nintendo 's Wii has still come quite some way since its launch .
As the family - friendly system , there are some options that are painfully missing to this day — such as media playback capabilities — but there are a few surprises lying in store for those who otherwise just wanted to play Mario Kart .
Online multiplayer really kicked into gear on the Wii this year , as Nintendo moved forward with online play in its big first - party titles and was matched by some third - party developers as well .
Games like Madden 2009 and Medal of Honor : Heroes 2 have seamless systems which negate the clunky Friend codes used to connect to others all together , while Nintendo 's titles like Mario Kart Wii and Super Smash Brothers Brawl have made it much easier to get into games with random people without codes .
Voice chat has also come to the Wii , courtesy of Wii Speak and Animal Crossing Wii .
A voucher bundled with the area microphone allows users to engage in voice chat with those on their friends list , while Animal Crossing itself features in - game voice chat when you invite others to your town .
Another area that the Wii really shines in is downloadable games .
In addition to the growing library of Virtual Consoles pooled from tons of classic systems , Nintendo this year pushed out the WiiWare platform , which gives smaller developers the chance to release new games digitally .
The service is already host to some amazing games , and it continues to be updated each week with great content .
And for those who want a little more out of their consoles , the Wii is n't as bad as some make it seem .
The Opera Browser has improved over the year , offering better performance and a more stable online experience .
And the News and Weather channels , which offer real - time updates from around the world , were supplemented with the Nintendo channel , which keeps users apprised of all the Nintendo - related happenings .
While it may be short on some of the features of the advanced high - definition consoles , the Wii is still very much a blossoming system that shows more and more with each passing day that Nintendo is finally embracing the internet and the concept that a console can be for more than just games — even if it 's the strong first - party games and the local multiplayer options that really make the Wii worth owning .
Summing it up
So which SKUs should you buy and how much will they cost you ?
That 's information that will have to wait until our Holiday Buyer 's Guide arrives .
For now , though , suffice to say that each of the consoles offers some great gaming at suiting prices .
No matter which console you pick this season , you 're in for a treat .
The Xbox 360 continues to mature with a new interface and a robust video content offering , the PS3 is finally coming into its own with peripheral support and sheer functionality , and the Wii is gaining ground with a great downloadable content platform and accessible implementations of familiar features like voice chat .
This is a great time to be a gamer , and it 's only getting better .
DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton introduced herself as a " proud supporter of Barack Obama " at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday as she called on her party to rally behind her former rival .
Sen . Hillary Clinton , with daughter Chelsea , receives a standing ovation from the Democratic delegates .

" Whether you voted for me , or voted for Barack , the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose .
We are on the same team , and none of us can sit on the sidelines .
This is a fight for the future .
And it 's a fight we must win together , " she said .
Leading up to her address , there was a lot of speculation about what she would say and whether she would make a strong enough call for unity .
But she made a very strident case for Obama 's candidacy .
" No way .
No how .
No McCain .
Barack Obama is my candidate .
And he must be our president , " Clinton said .
Her speech , which was the last of the night , followed a line up of other Democrats who used their time at the podium to attack President Bush 's record and McCain 's policies .
Appearing strong and energized , Clinton thanked her voters for supporting her historic campaign as a female candidate and reached out to those wary of Obama by telling them they were n't in this for her , but for her cause .
That cause , she said , is the same thing that Obama and the rest of the Democratic Party are fighting for .
Watch Clinton 's entire speech »
Many analysts said the speech would end speculation that Clinton has not fully embraced Obama as her party 's candidate .
Clinton mentioned Obama by name more than twice as many times as she mentioned the party as a whole .
Analysts weigh in on the night 's speakers »
" I thought she was a class act , " said political analyst David Gergen , who worked in the Clinton administration .
" I think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight . "
Clinton also praised Obama 's newly tapped vice presidential candidate , Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware .
The former first lady called Biden " pragmatic , tough and wise . "
Watch Clinton talk about the Obama - Biden team »
Clinton was met with a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience .
Only a few pockets of the standing - room only convention center were n't on their feet cheering for her .
Observers said she had the biggest reception of the evening .
As soon as the speech ended , the McCain campaign issued a statement implying that Clinton did nothing to dispel her previous criticism of Obama .
" Sen . Clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that Barack Obama is not prepared to lead as commander - in - chief .
Nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment , " McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said .
" Nowhere tonight did she say that Barack Obama is ready to lead .
Millions of Hillary Clinton supporters and millions of Americans remain concerned about whether Barack Obama is ready to be president . "
The McCain campaign has stepped up its effort to woo disaffected Clinton supporters , running ads highlighting Clinton 's criticism of Obama during the primaries .
Obama called Clinton after the speech and thanked her for her support and said she could not have done a better job .
Earlier , former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner appealed across party lines in his keynote address .
Obama has been campaigning hard to win Virginia , which has n't voted for a Democratic president since President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 .
Watch Warner make his case for Obama »
According to CNN 's electoral map , the state is a toss - up going into the general election .
In order for Obama to take the state 's 13 electoral votes , he would need to win over some of Virginia 's independent and Republican voters .
Instead of tearing into the current administration , Warner talked about ideas -- highlighting science and technology .
" I know we 're at the Democratic convention , but if an idea works , it really does n't matter if it has an ' R ' or ' D ' next to it , " Warner said .
" Because this election is n't about liberal versus conservative .
It 's not about left versus right .
It 's about the future versus the past . "
His words echoed Obama 's own keynote speech of four years ago when the then little known senator from Illinois spoke of what united rather than divided Americans .
In 2004 , before John Kerry was nominated for president , Obama said to delegates : " There is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America .
There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America -- there 's the United States of America . "
Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said Warner 's address could do for him what Obama 's address did four years ago .
Watch Warner 's entire speech »
" It 's a very powerful speech .
He 's going to come out of this convention the way Barack Obama came out of the last convention -- as the rock star , as the next guy , " he said .
" It was an important speech because if this election is about experience and strength , McCain wins .
But if this election 's about the past versus the future , Republicans have a much tougher job . "
Warner 's most blunt criticism of President Bush was that he has kept the country from living up to its potential .
Tuesday's other speakers played up Obama 's message of change and tore into McCain , saying he would only bring about more of the same .
Pennsylvania Sen. Robert Casey Jr. at one point feigned shock at the idea that the Republican Party was asking for four more years in the White House , promising the party of President Bush and McCain " not four more years , but four more months . "
In response , the delegates jumped to their feet shouting , " Four more months !
Four more months ! "
Audience members also waved signs that said " McCain more of the same . "

So , what ’s the exit strategy ?
Mathematically speaking , Ponzi schemes are doomed .
They work by bringing in new investors to pay off old ones .
In pure form , there ’s never any actual business activity ; the money just rolls backward from ever - increasing numbers of investors to keep up the appearance of profits .
This means the scheme requires an infinite supply of new suckers .
Anyone sophisticated enough to concoct a Ponzi scheme  and con experienced investors and government agents , as the New York financier Bernard Madoff is accused of doing  must also be sophisticated enough to do the math here .
So how can Ponzi perpetrators possibly expect to extricate themselves from their ploys ?
Based on historical examples relayed by a few biographers , historians and finance experts , the exit strategies seem to fall into four general categories :
CUT AND RUN
These Ponzi schemers , a subset of the “ Music Man ” breed of professional swindler , are the small - time crooks , the snake - oil salesmen .
They plan to rip off everyone in River City , hop on a train , change identity , and then start over , from the top , in the next town .
Few big - time Ponzi schemers go this route , however .
That ’s because big Ponzi schemes usually exploit the trust of a tightly knit social network .
Mr. Madoff is accused of victimizing wealthy Jews .
The Foundation for New Era Philanthropy , a Philadelphia - area scheme that collapsed in 1995 , preyed largely on Christian religious organizations .
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader asked his interior ministry Wednesday to investigate any possible abuse of police authority after a number of Facebook Web activists were detained .
ZAGREB - Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader asked his interior ministry Wednesday to investigate any possible abuse of police authority after a number of Web activists were detained .
In the last few days officers have held and questioned several Internet activists who were criticizing or ridiculing the government , local media reported .
" No one in Croatia can be detained or arrested because of a different opinion or because of a protest against my or any other political view .
My main task as a prime minister is to defend that right , " Sanader said in a statement .
This week , according to the local media , police had questioned organizers of a group on Facebook , the online social networking site , which called an anti-government rally in several towns , including the capital Zagreb , for December 5 .
The group has more than 80,000 members .
Last Friday police questioned a member of the main opposition party , the Social Democrats , after he launched a group called " I bet I can find 5,000 Facebookers who dislike Sanader . "
Police said it had acted because he posted a photo montage portrait of Sanader in a Nazi uniform .
An editorial in a local daily this week , entitled " Stop Facebook , " said the authorities were acting in a manner similar to Yugoslav communists , who distrusted the media and wanted to control them .
Sanader said he wanted a report from the Interior Minister , Tomislav Karamarko , on those cases .
" I asked for a report on police actions and I want appropriate sanctions if police did not respect regulations , " his statement said .

Call for Top End farming research
News analysis Investing in agriculture in Australia 's north could not only be a way to beat climate change , but could also help feed the planet , says a new report .
The report , titled A Food Secure World : How Australia Can Help , released by the Crawford Fund this week , calls for more investment in research that will help farmers internationally .
Co-author Dr Denis
Blight says drought is one of the key reasons behind falling global food supplies .
He says northern Australia is an attractive possible site for more farming because of its semi-arid tropical environment , which has a guaranteed wet season .
" If you can grow food there [ in the Top End ] , then you bloody well should , " says Blight , Executive Director of the Crawford Fund .
But he says previous attempts to farm the continent 's north have failed due to a lack of knowledge , which is why research is badly needed .
Farming in this area is challenging because of its long dry season , poor soils and a lack of knowledge about tropical pest and diseases and appropriate crops for the area .
Helping African farmers
Blight says working out how to farm in the Top End could not only help Australia , but deliver the scientific knowledge that millions of smallholder crop and livestock producers in Africa need to increase their own productivity .
" The climatic conditions in northern Australia are very similar to those in the central strip of sub-Saharan Africa ... and that 's where most of the world 's poor people are , " says Blight .
As well as farming the Top End , Blight says further investment is needed to find crops that are tolerant to drought and salinity , practices that make farms more resilient to uncertain climate , and biofuels that do n't put pressure on food supplies .
" We should be investing more on research to look at conversion of woody plants and grasses into biofuels , " he says .
Blight describes such internationally - relevant agricultural research as a " win-win situation " .
" Not only do developing countries benefit from the output of the research but so does Australia . "
GM crops and organic farming
The Crawford Fund report also calls for recognition of the role of crops developed using modern biotechnology in food security .
It says GM crops have boosted productivity in a number of countries , but their more widespread use is limited by public concerns and regulatory hurdles .
The report suggests this should change given such crops are becoming more widely cultivated without any demonstrated negative effects on the environment or human health .
Blight says negotiations are underway to make patented seeds available to poor farmers .
" We need to engage with the Monsanto's of the world to persuade them to make seeds available free under licence to the poorest of the poor , " he says .
Whilst not mentioned in the Crawford Fund report , a number of reports from the United Nations have recently highlighted the importance of organic agriculture in helping poor farmers in an uncertain climate .
A new report from the UN Environment Program and the UN Conference on Trade And Development reports that organic farming has improved productivity , farm incomes and provided environmental benefits in drought - affected areas of east Africa .
UNEP executive director , Achim Steiner , says GM has its attractions but its promises have been hyped .
He says feeding more than 9 billion people by 2050 will require a range of creative solutions .
" There is no single panacea , " he says .
" It is not the transgenic revolution .
It is not the organic revolution ... there 's no one right way . "
He says organic farming is one " rational economic approach " for poor farmers who can't afford the cost of chemical inputs .
" Organic farming deserves as much scientific scrutiny and validation as any other element of an agricultural production strategy , " says Steiner , who calls on Australian scientists to lead the world in the search for low - input farming systems .
Blight agrees that low - input agriculture is a key area for research , but describes organic agriculture as " simplistic " .
" Organic agriculture has great appeal , including to both my children , but it 's not going to solve the world 's problems , " he says .
Experts for the future
Regardless of what solutions Australia investigates to help feed a hungry world , Blight says the country will have to do something about the falling number of agricultural science graduates .
The report says that there is an estimated demand for graduates in excess of 2000 a year , but graduate completion rates are below 800 a year .
" Unless we can breed some new scientists , we 're going to be in trouble , " he says .
Blight suggests one way to attract young people to agricultural science is to highlight its role in " saving the world " , and include study time in an international agricultural research centre .
" It makes it suddenly an exciting career - an exciting prospect , " he says .

A map of natural hazard mortality in the United States has been produced .
The map gives a county - level representation of the likelihood of dying as the result of natural events such as floods , earthquakes or extreme weather .
Susan Cutter and Kevin Borden , from the University of South Carolina , Columbia , used nationwide data going back to 1970 to create their map .
According to Cutter , " This work will enable research and emergency management practitioners to examine hazard deaths through a geographic lens .
Using this as a tool to identify areas with higher than average hazard deaths can justify allocation of resources to these areas with the goal of reducing loss of life " .
Hazard mortality is most prominent in the South , where most people were killed by various severe weather hazards and tornadoes .
Other areas of elevated risk are the northern Great Plains Region where heat and drought were the biggest killers and in the mountain west with winter weather and flooding deaths .
The south central US is also a dangerous area , with floods and tornadoes posing the greatest threat .
Heat / drought ranked highest among the hazard categories , causing 19.6 % of total deaths , closely followed by severe summer weather ( 18.8 % ) and winter weather ( 18.1 % ) .
Geophysical events ( such as earthquakes ) , wildfires , and hurricanes were responsible for less than 5 % of total hazard deaths combined .
Cutter said , " What is noteworthy here is that over time , highly destructive , highly publicized , often catastrophic singular events such as hurricanes and earthquakes are responsible for relatively few deaths when compared to the more frequent , less catastrophic events such as heat waves and severe weather ( summer or winter ) " .
The authors conclude , " The spatial patterns revealed in our results may be unsurprising – greater risk of death along the hurricane coasts , in the interior west , and in the South – all areas prone to natural hazards as well as significant population growth and expansion throughout the study period .
However , using this analysis as a blueprint for hazard mortality ' hot spots ' supports justification for a more in - depth study of hazard - induced deaths in specific regions or communities .
It is at this local scale where defining the deadliest hazard becomes important and emergency management officials can take action to try to reduce the number of future deaths " .

Outlet Switch Fights Vampire Energy Usage
November 6th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Are you too lazy to go around unplugging appliances when you ’re done with them ?
Do you still consider yourself environmentally aware ?
Then maybe it ’s time to look into purchasing the Harriet Carter Outlet Switch .
The device — not to be confused with a power strip — is a current cutter that allows you to turn off electricity flow while appliances are still plugged in .
If you want to make life even easier , plug a power strip into the switch for the ability to cut electricity flow from multiple devices at once .
Most of the electronics we use every day — TV’s , DVD players , cell phone chargers — leech power even when they ’re off , so Harriet Carter ’s device could save some serious energy .
And while it is n’t the only outlet switch on the market , its $ 5 price tag may make it the cheapest .

Seed - GObject JavaScriptCore bridge
Seed is a library and interpreter , dynamically bridging ( through GObjectIntrospection ) the WebKit JavaScriptCore engine , with the GNOME platform .
Seed serves as something which enables you to write standalone applications in JavaScript , or easily enable your application to be extensible in JavaScript .
Latest release can be found here
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/seed/
Introduction
Seed is built around the idea of " minimal - platform " , in that it seems a theoretically ideal GNOME development language provides no platform of its own , but instead seamlessly integrates with the already quite large GNOME platform .
Some of Seed are listed below :
Dynamically load and bind libraries for which GObjectIntrospection data is available .
Methods , constructors , properties , signals , interfaces , etc. transparently bind to JavaScript .
Maps C-isms ( say , out arguments , or enums ) to things that make sense in JavaScript .
Garbage collector integration with GObject reference counts for automatic memory management .
Structs are allocated and memory managed effeciently with g_slice .
Automatic and powerful type conversion , capable of converting between everything from simple types , to GList / Array , to boxing JavaScript functions up in C function pointers ( required by some libraries for say , foreach functions ) .
Automatic GError integration with JavaScript exceptions .
You leave the GError argument out of your arguments , and internally Seed passes it in to the method , and throws an exception with the proper name and message if an error is generated .
Some " syntactic sugar " which makes code more pleasant to write , such as JSON key / value pairs for constructor properties , literals for structs ( stage.color = {red : 200} ) .
Ability to define new GTypes which inherit from existing GTypes .
As of now you can not implement abstract methods , but beyond that it works .
Signals and properties work .
A C module system , useful for binding libraries which are not GObject based ( such as readline , sqlite , and many low level POSIX functons ) .
At this point , the vast majority of the GNOME platform is usable from Seed .
In general using any GObject based API ( internal to your application , or a library ) in Seed , should not be difficult , and should simply require a few changes to your build scripts to allow generation of the introspection data .
There is a writeup on Seed which I believe provides a good description .
Current Status
By and large Seed is able to properly bind anything in the GNOME platform .
One of the biggest shortfalls in Seed as of now is the lack of ability to implement GObject interfaces ( though in general subclassing does work ) .
I believe Seed to be mostly leak free at this point , however it is not as memory efficient as it could be , in particular where closures are involved ( It still compares quite favorably to languages such as Python however ) .
License
Seed is available under the LGPL .
Most of the examples are under a BSD license , however some of the more complicated ones ( such as lightsoff or same - seed ) are under the GPL .
Documentation
Seed has a wide variety of examples , located at http://git.gnome.org/cgit/seed-examples, covering many common tasks in a " cookbook " style fashion , and several more complete applications .
Seed has a ( small ) documentation site which covers the C API , the Seed runtime , and a tutorial aimed at Gtk beginners to create a small web browser .
In the future this will likely be expanded .
There are now some documentation for the bound libraries , along with A short description on how it 's generated
A small JavaScript
Side tutorial is located here .
Editor Support
There may one day be an emacs mode for Seed , in the mean time I suggest espresso- mode , though some people prefer js2 - mode .
There is a Summer of Code project for adding JavaScript support to Anjuta .
Requirements
Seed is fairly light on dependencies :
GObject - Introspection from GIT
A recent version of WebKitGtk
To be useful , Seed will also require gir-repository .
Development is in Gnome 's git repository
Browse : http://git.gnome.org/browse/seed
git clone git :
Some discussion takes place in #seed on GIMPnet .
Bugs can be reported in the issue tracker .
There is a user / developer mailing list on GNOME mailman .
Robert Carr < racarr at gnome dot org >
Tim Horton < hortont424 at gmail dot com >
Examples
These are a few small examples , to give a quick picture of what Seed looks like .

timeline = new Clutter .
Timeline ( { fps : 60 , num_frames : 30 } ) ;
Methods and Properties

signal .
load_commited .
connect ( update_url , entry ) ;
Note that the function could be an inline anonymous function , instead of a closure .
Also of interest is the fact that the second argument to the signal connections represents the userdata which is passed to the signal handler .
New Types and Signals
HelloLabel = new GType ( { parent : Gtk .

Man or boy test
Do you know the Knuth 's " man or boy " test ?
If not , see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_or_boy_test that contains explanations and implementations in various languages .
A Perl5 implementation is : sub A { my ( $k , $ x1 , $ x2 , $ x3 , $ x4 , $ x5 ) = @_ ; my $ B ; $ B = sub { return A ( -- $k , $ B , $ x1 , $ x2 , $ x3 , $ x4 ) ; } ; return &$ x4 ( ) + &$ x5 ( ) if ( $k <= 0 ) ; return &$ B ( ) ; } print A ( 10 , sub{1} , sub{ - 1} , sub{ - 1} , sub{1} , sub{0} ) , "
" ; # the expected result is - 67 In r32377 , I commit a Lua implementation that works on Parrot .
Can we do a Perl6 implementation with the current Rakudo ?

Twelve men were decapitated and dumped at separate sites in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero , authorities said Sunday .
Mexican news outlets quoted Guerrero Gov. Zeferino Torreblanca Galindo as saying that eight of the men were identified as Mexican soldiers and another as a former state police commander .
Earlier , Mexican media had said that the victims ’ close - cropped hair indicated they were soldiers .
Nine of the heads and bodies were discovered Sunday in the city of Chilpancingo , the state capital .
The heads were bundled in a plastic bag and dumped at a shopping center , and the bodies turned up in two other locations at opposite ends of the city , authorities said .
Local prosecutors said three more decapitated bodies were found in a village on the outskirts of the city , the Associated Press reported .
The find came two days after three gunmen were killed in a shootout with soldiers in Guerrero .
Mexican media said the beheadings may have been intended as retribution .
The website of the daily El Universal newspaper , citing unnamed state law enforcement officials , reported that a message that accompanied the bag of heads warned : “ For every one of mine you kill , I ’m going to kill 10 of yours . ”
Beheadings have become increasingly common around Mexico amid rising drug - related violence that has killed more than 5,300 people this year .
President Felipe Calderon launched a crackdown against drug traffickers upon taking office two years ago , triggering clashes between security forces and gunmen and vicious feuding among rival drug gangs .
The coastal state of Guerrero , home to the Acapulco resort , has been one of the drug war ’s more violent corners .
Nearly 500 people have been killed there since January 2007 , a month after Calderon announced his anti-crime offensive , according to a tally by the University of San Diego ’s Trans - Border Institute .
As part of his crackdown , Calderon has sent 45,000 soldiers and 5,000 federal police into the streets across the country .
The offensive has produced thousands of arrests and some major seizures of drugs , cash and weapons , though there is no sign that any of the main drug gangs have been dislodged .
Most of the killings have resulted from turf wars among drug - trafficking organizations , which battle for the most coveted routes for smuggling into the United States .
ken.ellingwood@latimes.com
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino , an ally of President Felipe Calderon , died on Tuesday when a small plane he was traveling in crashed into evening rush hour traffic in Mexico City .
The reason for the crash was not clear but a civil aviation disaster expert told Reuters that sabotage could not be ruled out , along with other possible causes like engine failure .
Seven other people were killed and 40 injured when the government Learjet smashed into the street in an upscale business district of the capital , setting several cars ablaze .
Calderon , who is waging a high - stakes war on Mexico ’s powerful drug cartels , mourned the loss of a close aide and friend who had worked with him for years .
“ Mexico has lost a compatriot who worked for the service of his country , ” Calderon said in a televised speech .
“ The federal government , under my charge , in coordination with the relevant institutions , will carry out all necessary investigations in order to check in depth what caused this tragedy , ” he said .
Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , the deputy attorney general until recently and a key player for years in Mexico ’s army - led war on drug cartels , was among other government officials who died in the crash .

More than 4,000 people have been killed this year , mainly drug traffickers but also police and soldiers , by drug gang hitmen lashing back at Calderon ’s anti-cartel campaign and fighting new turf wars with each other .
Drug gangs appeared to take their feud with the government to a new level in September when a grenade was lobbed into a crowd of civilians celebrating a national holiday .
Authorities are holding three men charged with carrying out the attack for the Gulf cartel ’s armed “ Zetas ” wing .
Communications Minister Luis Tellez said everything pointed to Tuesday ’s crash being caused by an accident , but Jorge Lara , vice president of a national civil aviation rescue committee said it was too early to be sure .
“ It could have been anything , from mechanical failure to sabotage , ” Lara told Reuters .
PLANE NOSEDIVED
A colleague of Lara at the scene said it appeared that something happened to the plane in the air and it nosedived into the ground , with minimal damage to surrounding buildings .
Mourino , who was 37 and married with three children , was a rising star in Mexican politics who helped engineer conservative Calderon ’s 2006 election victory against a leftist popular with many in poorer parts of the country .

A U.S. - educated economist and former lawmaker , Mourino was picked to head the interior ministry in January to help push Calderon ’s reform agenda through the divided Congress .
Vasconcelos was a veteran police chief with a 20 - year career at the attorney general ’s office .
As the smoking wreckage clogged up traffic on one of Mexico City ’s main thoroughfares , Mayor Marcelo Ebrard told reporters at the scene there was no way Mourino had survived .
“ It ’s a fact .
There is no other possibility , ” Ebrard said .
Mexican radio reported an air traffic controller as saying the aircraft had been coming in to land at Mexico City airport when it hit the ground between tall office buildings .
Tellez said there was no contact with the plane moments before the crash , which had been returning from a trip to the central city of San Luis Potosi .
Recently unsealed search warrants revealed the call made from the cell phone of Brittany Zimmermann on the day she was killed started with a woman screaming and sounds of a struggle for a short period of time .
However , a statement released by the Dane County Public Safety Communication Center , maintains that the call indicated no emergency .
“ An investigation done in May by the 911 Center found no evidence the dispatcher who took a call from Ms. Zimmermann ’s cell phone heard anything that indicated an emergency was occurring , ” the statement said .
Seven search warrants containing details about the homicide investigation had been sealed and resealed since they were issued , in order to protect the investigation
The seals expired last Wednesday and no request to reseal them was made .
The Wisconsin State Journal reported on the details on Tuesday after obtaining copies of the documents on Monday .
“ The public airing of these formerly sealed documents was not sought by the Madison Police Department , and it would have been preferable — from an investigative standpoint — that they would have remained sealed , ” said Madison Police spokesperson Joel DeSpain in a statement released Tuesday .
The details
Around 11:30 a.m. on April 2 , Brittany Zimmermann ’s fianc ?
Jordan Gonnering saw her while he was standing on the balcony adjacent to Van Hise hall while talking to her on his cell phone and looking down at her on the ground floor .
According to the search warrant , Zimmermann ’s call was received about one hour later at 12:20 p.m. and was disconnected after “ the sound of a woman screaming and … background sounds of a struggle for a short period of time . ”
The Dane County Communications Center staff called back immediately and a male caller with an accent answered Zimmermann ’s cell phone and said he did not place the call .
Approximately 48 minutes elapsed between when Zimmermann called 911 and when police responded at 1:08 p.m. after Gonnering called police .
When police arrived at 1:15 p.m. , they found Gonnerning crying , trembling and in shock with Zimmerman lying on the ground .
One warrant revealed Zimmermann died from “ complex homicidal violence including multiple stab wounds and strangulation . ”
Investigators determined the wounds were caused by “ a weapon similar in nature to one possessing a blade length from 2 to 5 inches , blade width of 1.5 to 2 cm , and with a non-prominent hilt . ”
There was no weapon left at the scene and none has been discovered .
Investigators also found the perpetrator “ made forcible entry to the main front door ” which was security locked .
One of the warrants says investigators found DNA on Zimmermann ’s body that was not hers and took a total of 23 swabs of DNA , 10 fingerprints and nine partial footwear prints .
In addition , investigators took 18 blood samples , a pair of bloody women ’s slippers and computer paper with what appeared to be blood spots .
The suspects
Apart from details regarding the crime scene and the 911 call Zimmermann made on the day she was killed , the search warrants revealed three suspects who have been investigated and subsequently ruled out .
Thomas Cosgrove , 51 , Jeffery D. Ball , 49 , and Chauncey Mack , 53 , were all suspects in the search warrants .
According to a search warrant , a witness said Mack was talking with another man about the homicide at Concrete Park , located on the 500 block of State Street .
Mack told the other man that “ he had gone to do a robbery and the ‘ girl ’ was home , ” so he said he “ did what he had to do ” and elaborated that he “ stabbed her , somewhere between 8 and 12 times . ”
However , Mack ’s DNA profile was inconsistent with the DNA found at the crime scene .
The other two men were also ruled out as suspected due to DNA and other factors , according to Schauf .
The 911 Controversy
The audio for the 911 call is still being held by Dane County and Madison Police investigators as a piece of important evidence .
Since the controversial mishap , the 911 Center ’s Director Joe Norwick resigned and County Executive Kathleen Falk has included funding in Dane County ’s budget for a number of improvements to the current center , including a new priority dispatching software .
“ While it is impossible to eliminate all chances for human error , steps have been taken in recent months to minimize opportunities for error , ” the 911 Center statement said .
Nancy Mistele , Falk ’s opponent in the upcoming election , said the improvements to the 911 Center should have been made after the recommendations were made four years ago .
“ The longer we wait to implement 2004 recommendations for the 911 center to avert potential catastrophe , the more we put every Dane County resident at risk of future failures of our emergency response system , ” Mistele said .
“ This is a crisis of leadership . ”
Following this thread , here is my review of Practical API Design .
Jaroslav Tulach is the founder and original architect of the NetBeans project .
Practical API Design is a book with apparently one bold aim : to be the book that gets people thinking seriously about the topic of API design -- in particular the maintenance of backwards compatibility in APIs -- and kick - starts an API design revolution , with more books and university courses to follow in its wake .
Incidentally , it can also be a highly readable introduction to API design , a thought - provoking set of warnings to experienced engineers embarking on managing a growing API and an entertaining odyssey through the development of the NetBeans API .
With regard to the main aim again , we must hope that more books and papers are indeed written developing this theme , as this book cannot do it all by itself ; more on that topic later .
The book is curiously subtitled " Confessions of a Java API Designer " , but due to the individual and highly digressive style ( at least in part one ) a more apt subtitle may be " " The Life and Opinions of Jaroslav Tulach , Gentleman " .
It may seem odd at first , but later in the book this style does show its strengths .
My experience of trying to find good material on the subject of the maintenance of backwards compatibility is the same as the author 's : I can find very little worth reading , and nothing that covers the subject in depth .
Therefore the book must take a personal point of view , setting down beliefs and opinions and setting them down strongly in the hope that a reaction is provoked .
The areas in which this book lacks are advanced as areas into which you , the reader , might contribute .
This is the book as a call to arms rather than an attempt at solid theory .
I think the approach works rather well .
The question uppermost on my mind when picking up the book for the first time was , " how Java - specific is this ? " .
Tulach has attempted to push Java specifics into the second of the three parts ( the largest ) , and has mostly succeeded , although some Java - centricity is noticable in part three .
That is not to say that the second part is useless to those not using Java ; far from it !
This section is the practical part -- where the theory was built up and strengthened on the proving - grounds of NetBeans development ; as such it is integral to the book whichever language you are using .
But if you are using a different language , how much extra work is required ?
Quite a bit , unfortunately .
What you can and cannot do in a compatible way is dependent on the details of the binary interface ( which may well be compiler - specific if not laid down in the language or other specification ) , so there is no way at all that one book can attempt to do this in a generic way .
My own point of view is Symbian OS APIs , which are affected by the C++ language in which they are written , the EABI binary interface specification and the decision to use link - by - ordinal -- this combination needs its own careful consideration and results in a different set of emphases to those Tulach advances ; for example , the specific technical dos and don'ts require much more effort and explaination in C++ , and the idea of a checking tool would warrant more than the four lines it gets in Practical API Design .
This means that , if you are using a language other than Java , you must think about each piece of advice with respect to the peculiarities of the languages you are using .
Worse than that , of course , you must work out for yourself what sorts of compatibility difficulties you might have that are entirely unmentioned by the book ; C++ has many such pitfalls .
All of the code samples are in Java ; most are clear and easy to understand , although often too fond of generics to be easily parsed by a newcomer to Java .
Tulach also denies us any warm fuzzy feeling when one of his very first examples is a two - page horror involving some subtle implicit effects and highly Java - specific calls that will be totally opaque to the Java neophyte , as well as an apparent instance of double - checked locking and a curious piece of at - first - sight useless code that must be for multi- thread access ( p76 ) .
Having studied it with some Java expert colleagues , we have convinced ourselves that the code is , in fact , correct .
But we have not convinced ourselves that it is " good design " .
Tulach will retort , as he does many times in the text , that beauty should be sacrificed every time in favour of keeping compatibility , and he is right .
So now working out if a nicer solution would have the same benefits is an exercise for the reader ; this is not out of keeping with the book as a whole , as much is for the reader to work out .
This is not because Tulach has failed to put together a compelling book ; he has .
It is because he has deliberately overreached in order to present to us a vision of what can be achieved with care , hard work and the right attitude .
However , the low - level detailed answers must come from the reader .
As a reader embarking on the beginnings of their own project , the book takes the form of a stern warning of the pitfalls that lies ahead , and sketches some potential solutions .
For a project using only Java , the book seems to me ( I am no Java expert ) a thorough sketch of the territory ahead .
Colourful , passionately argued and totally convincing .
As a reader already scarred by the trials of compatibility maintenance , there will be many nods of recognition and some pointers of where the compatibility armour could do with some hardening .
The book is a valuable read .
As a reader looking to translate NetBeans ' lessons into another ( machine ) language , there is much more work to do , as I have already mentioned .
There is no technical scaffolding against which to build a compatibility policy ; no guide or checklist of things to look out for .
For example , if one were to attempt to come up with compatibility rules for Haskell , one would have to delve deeply into how each element affects the binary to which others link , and how this linking occurs .
Explaining this is not the purpose of the book .
It will definately give a head - start as some issues will overlap between your target language and Java , at the expense of having to learn why certain things work and other things do not in Java .
This is good education anyway -- I even found a new ( somewhat grudging ) respect for the language .
As a reader looking for cookbook techniques for the design and maintainance of Java APIs one is likely to be disappointed .
The correct way to read Practical API Design seems to be with a notebook in hand , jotting down interesting topics and random thoughts that occur ( some of my questions that occurred took many , many chapters to be answered ) , then re-reading and fleshing out how each topic applies to your situation .
If you get that far , maybe you could publish it too as a cookbook !
But Practical API Design is not a cookbook .
I was slightly disappointed by a particular omission ; there is no discussion on the circumstances under which one might consider a break acceptable .
For example , if you need a new system - wide feature ( a multi - module search , for example , whose index would be invalidated by anybody having continuous access to the data ) , or a new architecture for performance purposes that makes an old API impossible , or an API is found to embody a security problem .
Perhaps you just know these issues when you see them and it is acceptable to have little discussion .
Tulach 's opinion is firm , even with bug - compatibility .
He will only admit that fixing a null pointer exception is OK ; I can't help feeling that some discussion is warranted here .
There is only one place where I actually found myself outright disagreeing with the author , though .
This is in the issue of whether maintaining compatibility of an API by making users enable the new API with an environment variable or other global switch is acceptable .
I always argue that this is not OK in Symbian , too , and am routinely ignored , so perhaps Tulach is in good company .
I feel that ( for some APIs ) pushing this decision on to customers ( especially as our customers have their own customers to look after ) rather than solving it more optimally ourselves is very rude .
At 383 non -index non-contents pages with 20 chapters covering testability , modularity , run-time issues , trust , teamwork and so on divided into 3 parts ( basically philosophy , practice and process ) it covers the ground very well .
Some might find the tone too chatty , although I liked the Jekyll - and - Hyde split between the zealous hardliner of the main text and the practical consensus - builder of the ( mostly NetBeans - specific ) sidebars .
I enjoyed Practical API Design ; I have not come across any book treating the subject of API maintenance in nearly such depth and breadth .
Recommended for architects who care about their APIs , especially those using Java .
Those using other languages will find much of value also .

Trade Idea : 2008-11-04 11:57
What ’s Up !
It looks like today ’s rally in risk is giving me an opportunity to play a Fibonacci setup on EUR / JPY today .
A return to the downside this week ?
My idea is based on both a technical setup and fundamental setup , but we ’ll take a look at the technicals first .
I have a 4 hour chart up and using the Fibonacci tool , we can see the pair found resistance just a few trading sessions ago at the 61 % Fibonacci retracement level .
Will that level hold again ?
It may and stochastics are indicating the run up may be running out of steam as it approaches 131.00
Fundamentally , I think after the US election event , focus will return to weak economics and the upcoming rate cuts coming from the European Central Bank this week .
Now , this may old news to the markets that we may see further rate cuts , but we are in a down trend and de-leveraging phase that may not be over yet , and this rally we ’re currently seeing is just another opportunity for players to revisit that sentiment .
I think that 130.00 – 131.00 will be the battle ground for bulls and bears in the short term , so I think I ’ll play the top of that range .
I ’ll be using a wide stop once again , in case volatility rises , so gonna have to gear down my position sizing .
Here ’s what I ’m gonna do :
Short EUR / JPY at 131.00 , stop at 133.50 , pt1 at 128.50 , pt2 at 115.00

Nov. 6 , 2008  --
Now that the defeated Republican presidential team of Sen. John McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have gone their separate ways , the knives are out and Palin is the one who is getting filleted .
But longtime Palin staffer Meg Stapleton is lashing back at anonymous critics within the McCain - Palin presidential campaign , telling ABC News they are attacking the former vice presidential candidate with distortions and blaming her for the Republican National Committee 's own missteps .
Revelations from anonymous critics from within the McCain - Palin campaign suggest a number of complaints about Palin .
Fox News reports that Palin did n't know Africa was a continent and did not know the member nations of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- the United States , Mexico and Canada -- when she was picked for vice president .
The New York Times reports that McCain aides were outraged when Palin staffers scheduled her to speak with French President Nicholas Sarkozy , a conversation that turned out to be a radio station prank .
Newsweek reports that Palin spent far more than the previously reported $ 150,000 on clothes for herself and her family .
Several publications say she irked the McCain campaign by asking to make her own concession speech on election night .
Palin Aide : Campaign Drove Wardrobe Controversy
However , Stapleton told ABC News the Fox News report on Africa and NAFTA was taken out of context .
She explained that during a briefing session , someone asked Palin to explain the McCain - Palin stance on an issue , and as she was responding , " in the middle , she said ' country of Africa ' and somebody instantly wrote it down and said , ' Oh , my God , she thinks it 's a country . ' "
But " she knows it 's a continent , " Stapleton said .
" It was just a human mistake , just like Obama saying 57 states .
I do n't think anyone ever doubted that Obama knows there are 50 states . "
Regarding the $ 150,000 worth of clothing , Stapleton claimed it was the campaign that said , " This is what you need as a VP candidate , and it was the campaign and / or the RNC [ Republican National Committee ] -- but it was n't the governor -- saying this is what she needs . "
Stapleton added that a New York stylist was told to go and make Palin look presidential , that Palin was simply presented with her wardrobe and staff and told , " Here 's your people , here are your clothes . "
The only items Palin remembers requesting from staff are toothpaste and coats for cold weather , Stapleton said .
Palin even saw a price tag of $ 3,500 on one suit jacket and said she did n't want to wear it , Stapleton said -- but she was told to wear it anyway .
Stapleton claimed there also was a directive to buy any and all clothes before Sept. 4 , the day the Republican convention in St. Paul , Minn. , ended , so that it could be buried as part of other convention costs .
" They said , ' Bill the convention under wardrobe so that the cost could be hidden , ' " Stapleton said .
" And then they realized and they were told that 's illegal .
So , then they said , ' OK , how do we make this legal and appropriate ? '
So , they had somebody pay for it and then the RNC would reimburse them . "
The person who paid for the clothing in the end was a wealthy GOP donor , Stapleton said .
The campaign also bought clothing for the Palin children so they , too , would look nice , Stapleton added .
When somebody realized the Palins did n't have any suitcases to bring the new clothes on the campaign trail , Stapleton said Palin e-mailed her husband Todd to bring her suitcases with him .
But instead , the campaign bought luggage .
Stapleton said $ 150,000 was the original bill , but after some merchandise was returned , the cost went down to $ 107,000 .
Regarding the concession speech , Stapleton said a McCain - Palin campaign speechwriter was flown in to write words for Palin to deliver Tuesday night after the election .
But after a discussion , aides decided only McCain would speak that evening -- not Palin .
Stapleton said Palin did n't understand why they would bring in a speechwriter and then not use the speech they wrote for her , which was complimentary of McCain .
Palin- GOP Tension May Keep Rising
One top McCain aide came to Palin 's defense today .
Randy Scheunemann , McCain 's top foreign policy adviser , who helped prepare Palin for her vice presidential debate , praised Palin 's campaign effort and intelligence .
" I 've been working over 20 years in Washington and I 've been around literally dozens and dozens of politicians .
She is among the smartest , toughest , most capable politicians I 've ever dealt with , " Scheunemann said .
" She has a photographic memory . "
But the tension between the Palin camp and other GOP groups is likely to continue or get worse .
Lawyers for the Republican National Committee are heading to Alaska to try to account for all the money that was spent on clothing , jewelry and luggage , according to The New York Times .
Reports of agitation between the two camps bubbled up in the final weeks of the campaign as Barack Obama began pulling away and the GOP duo was unable to regain the momentum .
But those reports are no longer in the rumor stage as McCain loyalists are now blasting away at the Alaska governor , who was a favorite of the Republican right during the campaign , but was cited in numerous polls as a reason why many Americans would n't vote for the Arizona Republican .
Perhaps the most dangerous allegation for Palin are reports in The New York Times and Newsweek that when she was urged by McCain adviser Nicole Wallace to buy three suits for the Republican convention and three suits for the campaign trail , she went on the now - infamous shopping spree at swank stores , like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus .
A Republican donor who agreed to foot a majority of the expenses was stunned when he received the bill , Newsweek reported .
Both the Times and Newsweek report that the budget for the clothing was expected to be between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 .
Instead , the amount reported by the Republican National Committee was $ 150,000 .
That was n't the whole tab , however , according to Newsweek .
The magazine claims that Palin leaned on some low - level staffers to put thousands of dollars of additional purchases on their credit cards .
The national committee and McCain became aware of the extra expenditures , including clothes for husband Todd Palin , when the staffers sought reimbursement , Newsweek reported .
Asked for a response by ABC News , the RNC released the following statement : " The committee 's requirement is to report to the FEC our expenditures and we have done so . "
McCain Aide Calls Palin Family ' Wasilla Hillbillies '
There is one comment in particular from a McCain aide that guaranteed to heighten friction between the two camps .
The angry aide described the Palin family shopping spree to Newsweek as " Wasilla hillbillies looting Neiman Marcus from coast to coast . "
It 's unclear how much McCain knew about the clothing debacle .
Reports suggest that he was kept out of the loop for fear that he would not approve .
Both Newsweek and The New York Times say McCain and Palin had little contact with each other .
" I think it was a difficult relationship , " one top McCain official confided to The New York Times .
But a high level McCain adviser told ABC News that the two had a good working relationship .
" He likes her , " this senior McCain adviser said last week .
" He 's had no problem with her .
He 's very appreciative of what she 's done . "
The adviser said McCain and Palin talked at least once a day .
He also said McCain frequently joked about how large Palin 's crowds were compared to his .
However , press accounts today suggest that Palin rubbed many of the McCain aides the wrong way .
On election night , when it was clear that McCain would be giving a concession speech instead of an acceptance speech , Palin approached McCain with a speech in hand hoping to make her own concession speech , according to published reports .
Vice presidential candidates traditionally leave the spotlight to the top of the ticket on election night and McCain aides made it clear to Palin that she would be a spectator that night , not a speaker , The New York Times reported .
And when McCain and Palin split up in Arizona Wednesday , the personal differences were stark .
McCain drove himself home in a Toyota sport utility vehicle .
Palin 's departure was a grander event .
She left with an entourage of 18 family members and friends and a Secret Service detail , heading to the airport in a motorcade stretching more than a dozen vehicles , flanked by a dozen more cops on motorcycles .
Interview Prep Lacking , McCain Staffers Say
McCain aides had numerous complaints about Palin .
She was unwilling or unable to find the time and energy to prep for her disastrous interview with CBS ' Katie Couric .
And when she did study , she astonished her handlers by her unsophisticated views .
She did n't know Africa was a continent , according to Newsweek .
Fox
News revealed that , during her cramming , she could n't name the three countries that belong to the North American Free Trade Agreement : the United States , Canada and Mexico .
Scheunemann suggested the Africa and NAFTA incidents were inaccurate .
" I was not present for all of her sessions , so I can't disprove that , " he told ABC News .
" I severely doubt that it is accurate .
It 's certainly not accurate in any of the sessions I had with her . "
Scheunemann said he was n't on the road with Palin in the days before her Couric interview , " so I do n't know a lot about it . "
But he said Palin 's debate prep " was very good . "
Scheunemann also denied published reports that he was suspected of leaking reports of discord between the two camps and was fired .
" I was never fired .
Anybody who claims I was fired is either lying or ... they are certainly a whack job , " he told ABC News .
Questions followed Palin home to Alaska .
She was asked about some of the accusations from anonymous sources when she landed there late Wednesday .
Asked about the Fox report that she did not know the NAFTA members or that Africa was a continent , Palin said , " If they 're an unnamed source , that says it all .
I wo n't comment on anyone 's gossip based on anonymous sources .
That 's kind of a small of a bitter type of person who anonymously would charge that I did n't know an answer to a question .
So , until I know who 's talking about it , I wo n't have a comment on a false allegation . "
Palin Insists She 's No Diva
When pressed on what went wrong with the campaign , she said , " I certainly am not one to ever waste time looking backwards . "
She defended herself against the notion that she is to blame for the failure of the McCain - Palin ticket .
" I do n't think anybody should give Sarah Palin that much credit , that I would trump an economic , woeful time in this nation that occurred about two months ago , that my presence on the ticket would trump the economic crisis that America found itself in a couple of months ago and attribute John McCain 's loss to me , " Palin told reporters in Arizona Wednesday .
" Now , having said that , if I cost John McCain even one vote , I 'm sorry about that because John McCain , I believe , is the American hero .
I had believed that it was his time .
... He being so full of courage and wisdom and experience , that valor he just embodies , I believe he would 've been the best pick , but that is not the Americans ' choice at this time . "
She also rejected the characterization that she was a " diva " on the campaign trail , as one anonymous McCain adviser told CNN .
" If only people , y'know , come on up and travel with us to Alaska and see this ' diva ' lifestyle that I supposedly live or would demand , because it 's just false , " she said .
Asked about her national political ambitions , she said , " I have not given it any thought in the context of making any kind of decisions at all , so no , just happy to be back here . "
In one of her favorite coffee shops in Wasilla Tuesday morning , Palin summed it up this way : " Forever , I 'm going to be Sarah from Alaska . "
I do n't know much about the IM software named Adium except that it resides under Mac .
It therefore , as I guess , has inherited the tradition of Mac of having charming GUI .
Apart from its beautiful software interface , it also has variety of distinguishing ' Message Style '
If you do n't understand what I am talking about , you may check this out .
As to these adorable message styles , they are based on the web render engine named ' Webkit ' , which is actually the reason why they are so attractive .
' Guys who are using Adium would be lucky ! ' if you love these styles you may think .
But you can be one of them even though you do n't use Adium .
There is a geek who just has written a plugin for Pidgin to use these affluent Adium message style !
But do n't tell me that you have no chance to use pidgin since it 's open source .
In the following , I will guide you how to make it rock on your computer :
1 . Where to find the necessary stuffs
Since Pidgin - Webkit is still on its beta stage , you may have to download the source code on its developer 's page :
you can refer to the official site of Webkit to compile and install it
and if you are lucky enough using the ubuntu as I am , there is an existing webkit package in the repository , about which I will walk you through below .
http://adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=search&cat_id=5
Are they the really eye - candy ?
I must ask . :)
add ' deb
http://ppa.launchpad.net/stemp/ubuntu hardy main ' into your software source , if you are using ubuntu Gutsy , you may change the ' hardy ' part to ' gutsy ' ;
' into your software source , if you are using ubuntu Gutsy , you may change the ' hardy ' part to ' gutsy ' ; then update your package information : sudo apt - get update
install the webkit package for development : sudo apt - get install libwebkit- dev
unpack the source code package you downloaded and get into the folder
simply type ' make ' to compile it
' to compile it then ' sudo make install ' to install it to the pidgin plugin folder
' to install it to the pidgin plugin folder if you encounter problems in this part , you may refer to the ' Trouble Shooting ' part below to find if you have the same problem as I did .
unpack the style package
copy the folders within it to this folder : ~/.purple/message_styles / : sudo cp -r style_folders ~/.purple/message_styles /
the version problem for package libgtk2.0
When I tried to install the libwebkit - dev package , I encountered the error which told me
The following packages have broken dependencies :
libgtk2.0-dev : Depends : libgtk2.0-0 ( = 2.12.9-3ubuntu4 ) but 2.12.9 - 4ubuntu3 will be installed
E : Broken Packages
it is because I had gnome2 - global - menu installed before that .
to get rid of it , you have to install the right package back :
first install the right version of libgtk2.0 - 0 : sudo apt - get install libgtk2.0-0=2.12.9-3ubuntu4
this will uninstall some packages such as gnome - themes gtk2- engines - pixbuf gtk2.0 - examples gucharmap libgtk2.0-bin
now install libgtk2.0 - dev : sudo apt - get install libgtk2.0-dev
reinstall the uninstalled packages : sudo apt - get install gnome - themes gtk2- engines - pixbuf gtk2.0- examples gucharmap libgtk2.0-bin
then this problem was solved
refer to : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=871606&page=2
the " No package ' pidgin ' found " problem
when I typed ' make ' to compile pidgin - webkit , this problem occured .
this is all about the package ' pidgin - dev ' , install it in your favorite way .
here you go .
when using the plugin , the pidgin suffers from crashing
when I use the plugin the first time , the pidgin gave me a crashing as an answer .
through searching , I figured out that it is likely to be the problem of wrong file ownership .
check the Adium message style folder you copied to . purple / message_styles / for the file owner .
If they do n't belong to you , you have to change them to this way :
sudo chown - hR yourusername thestylefolders
then relaunch pidgin
go to the ' Contents / Resources / ' folder under the style folder
open the file ' main.css ' with your text editor
within the ' # heading .conversation
With ' block and ' font : ' entry , add the font name of your language after ' Lucida Grande , '.
As for me , I added ' STHeiti ' .
It finally looks like ' font : bold 16px Myriad Pro , Myriad , Lucida Grande , STHeiti , Trebuchet MS , Arial ; '
Trebuchet MS , Arial ; ' and within the ' # heading .conversationTime ' and '.status_container ' blocks , go in the similar way .
within the '.tableBubble ' block , add the ' font : ' entry .
For instance , I added a new line ' font : 12px Myriad , Lucida Grande , STHeiti , Arial ; '
Arial ; ' and if you want to adjust the font size , you may go to the '.tableBubble .message ' block to change the ' font - size ' entry .
I just changed it to ' 12 p x '
[ Update ]
But before you can compile it into a usable pidgin plugin , you also have to install the Webkit on your system : Another thing you do n't want to forget is the message style resources , you can find them easily at First of all , you must make the Webkit available in your system .
As I mentioned , you can compile it yourself from the source code , which I am not going to talk about here .
Then another way is that you can install it from the repository :
By now , you have the webkit tool installed .
Second , it is time for you to compile the long - waited pidgin - webkit plugin :
Do n't rush to open pidgin to show the beautiful effect now , or you may meet a application crashing .
You have to go a little further to there .
Right , it is that you configure the style you chose with the plugin .
Now , it is the time to open Pidgin .
Go through , and check the plugin named '' , where the ' xx ' stands for the version .
Then open a message session , chat with your best friends facing the wonderful interface .
Surely , you cannot go through the steps above without any problems .
At least , I confronted so many problems while I am undergoing these stages .
I would paste them here and also my solutions to them , wish it helpful .
Until now , you can open pidgin to enjoy the different kinds beautiful message styles , can't you ?
But for me , I was not satisfied with the Chinese characters it displays .
Because most of the existing Adium message styles are designed by English speakers and they cannot be aware of other characters they do n't use , other poor language characters do n't shows great enough .
If you have this problem as I do , you can follow me .
I will lead you to configure the fonts for your language other than English .
By the way , I choosed the style named ' renkoo ' , I will take it for examples .
Then relaunch your pidgin , just enjoy the new face again !
Because my English is not so fluent , please forgive my problems in language .
I just take it as a note for myself , and I paste it here with the wish that it may be helpful .
Cheers !

My friend Richard sent me these photos tonight , saying
“ I do n’t know where these came from but they ’re going around the
net .
If you have n’t seen them already , I know you will enjoy them .
Do n’t ask questions , just marvel . ”
And marvel I did .
My God .
Have a look – ingredients and buildup here , the shocking conclusion after the jump .
When I worked as a pizza cook we deep - fried everything : cucumbers , strawberries , a pencil .
Once I battered and deep - fried some bacon and topped pizza with it .
And yeah , it was both gut - curdling and awesome .
But this .
This is something else entirely .
We never would have thought to put cheeseburgers , fries , and McNuggets on a pizza .
This is a culinary Frankenstein cooked by Bizarro , a crude combination of deliciousness into an artery - jamming fatty Voltron .
The thing is , I would totally eat it .
You would , too , stop lying .
The cheeseburger parts , the McNuggets — you know that ’d be tasty .
The fries might be the sleeper hit .
If this thing were in my house , I ’d totally roll my eyes and groan and make a big stink .
Then my curiosity would get the better of me and I ’d sneak a bite when nobody was around .
And I mean , you can tell it tastes pretty good .
If nobody were home for a day or so , I know I ’d end up eating the whole thing , morsel by greasy morsel .
It ’s the food equivalent of a Real Doll — a revolting , plastic , desperate experience that would just rope you in with tractor beams powered by an evil curiosity .
Maybe that ’s what the pistol ’s for .
Not to avoid the inevitable heart attack , but as an easy way out from the SHAME of it all .
UPDATE : Looking for dessert …?
If you 've been waiting for that Minority Report - style interface to really come to fruition , you can finally exhale .
One of the science advisors from the Steven Spielberg film -- along with a team of other zany visionaries -- has created an honest - to - goodness , real - world implementation of the computer systems seen in the movie .
Dubbed g- speak , the mind bending OS combines " gestural i/o , recombinant networking , and real - world pixels , " to deliver what the creators call " the first major step in [ a ] computer interface since 1984 . "
There are some things that need to seen to be understood , so watch the video after the break , and prepare to have your mind thoroughly blown to bits .

For the character , see Hubologist .
“ The Star Father will love you if you let him .
” — A Hubologist
The Hubologists are a religious sect headquartered in the former city of San Francisco , and can also be found at Nuka - World .
They originated as a cult founded before the Great War by a man known as Dick Hubbell ( or " The Hub " by Hubologists ) and follow his teachings that 's collectively called Hubology .
Contents show ]
Background Edit
Hubology originated as a cult founded before the Great War by science - fiction author Dick Hubbell ( dubbed " The Hub " by Hubologists ) .
It holds that existence is based on the Great Wheel , with the Hub at the center , Hubologists as the spokes and non-believers as the rim .
Eventually , all Hubologists will be called to the heavens to live with the " Star Father " on the planet Quetzel ; they plan to get there through the use of the thusly named ESS Quetzel .
Hubology belief holds that by purifying the ' neurodynes ' in one 's body , a person can ascend to greater levels of spiritual power and eventually transcend the material world .
[ 1]
In order to get help purifying these neurodynes , Hubologists will use scientific spirituality methods in exchange for a fee .
Their standard approach is to ask a new recruit to donate all his or her worldly possessions to the Church as a sign of good faith and apparently stash the possessions somewhere in the desert .
[ 2 ]
Donating lots of money to the Church of Hubology can also help one raise their AHS levels . [ 3 ]
In 2241 , the Hubologists only had some influence in San Francisco where their headquarters was situated .
In addition to their main base , they also had an outpost in New California Republic .
As of 2287 however , a small group of Hubology missionaries were lead by a direct descendant of Dick Hubbell , Dara to Nuka - World , with the goal of controlling a UFO ( in actuality , an decommissioned amusement ride ) to escape Earth and live on Quetzel .
Beliefs Edit
“ " The spirits of the dead are constantly trying to influence us .
They reach into our brain and alter our chemistry to create neurodynes .
Zeta radiation destroys some and drives the spirits away , but only for a short time . " ” Phil Roller
Hubology as a religion promotes the idea that humans are plagued by the spirits of the dead , causing neurodynes to form .
Neurodynes can also be formed through contact with so - called " suppressors " : people that suppress ones talents and abilities .
Their neurodyne - infested brainwaves can trigger neurodyne activity in others .
Through a " cleansing " process offered at Hubology centers called " alignment , " members can remove these negative influences and gain greater powers .
This is done using zeta radiation to destroy some of the neurodynes .
Multiple alignments are therefore required , each one destroying more neurodynes .
The degree to which a member has devoted his or her time , efforts and caps to Hubology accords him or her a numerical rank ; the Hubologist leader , AHS - 9 , holds the highest rank of any living Hubologist , with his second in command being AHS - 7 .
Guards are typically AHS - 4s .
In the group of Hubologists near Nuka - World , Dara Hubbell herself is also an AHS - 9 , with the Sole Survivor potentially becoming an AHS - 8 ( if they 're willing to spend the caps required ) .
Phil Roller is an AHS - 7 .
“ " The tools are man-made , but the process is a gift from the Star Father through his prophet , The Hub . " ” — Phil Roller
Hubologists believe that their founder , Dick Hubbell or " The Hub , " made contact with the Star Father long ago .
The Star Father lives on the distant planet " Quetzal " in the constellation of Zyphus .
Through him , the Hubologists have received the knowledge on " alignments . "
The Star Father is the source of life on earth and the Hubologists believe that they are all his descendants , but that they have lost their way , led astray by the neurodynes .
The Hub 's grand plan however will save them :
The Hub convinced the great Star Father to let the true faithful live with him on " Quetzal , " where they are forever saved from neurodynes .
The Star Father will free the full potential of their minds and they will be able to do unimaginable things .
Then they will return to Earth to rule over mankind to end the influence of neurodynes once and for all and guide the rest of mankind to its full potential .
Hubology uses a metaphor of a " wheel in the sky " to explain their existence , with Dick Hubbell representing the center hub of the wheel , the Hubologists the extending spokes , and non-members the outer rim , " crushed " by the truth of their teachings .
The existence of extraterrestrial life plays a role in Hubology , and as a part of this , the Hubologists in San Francisco are trying to repair a pre-War space shuttle to leave the planet , and the Hubologists in Nuka - World are trying to repair a UFO with the same goal .
Organization Edit
The Hubologists are headquartered in San Francisco in the ruins of the Golden Gate Bridge in 2241 and Hubologist camp in 2287 .
The cult has a strict hierarchy based off the degree to which a member has devoted their time and efforts to Hubology ; the longer or more active a role , the higher the numerical rank granted .
[ 4 ]
While he never physically manifests himself , Dick Hubbell is the leader of the Hubologists and his writings are law .
They are led by the " Great and Terrible " AHS - 9 who is the most enlightened of Hubologists , and below him is AHS - 7 .
All other members of the church of Hubology have a AHS level of at least 1 .
In addition to providing a simple explanation of existence that a common man can understand , the Hubologists use celebrity endorsements to draw people into their cult .
[ 5 ]
Being Hubologists themselves , the New Reno porn stars Juan Cruz and Vikki Goldman speak highly of the cult and use their renown to convince others to join the Church of Hubology . [ 6 ]
They urge people to make the " right " choice to do all you can do to cleanse their neurodynes of the filth of the world . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Joining the Church of Hubology is a very simple process .
Prospective followers are given an informational holodisc and then go talk to AHS - 7 about joining . [ 9 ]
Relations with the outside Edit
Hubology does not hold much influence outside of San Francisco .
A Hubology missionary known as the Enlightened One can be found in a Hubologist outpost in New California Republic , and there could be other missionaries out in the wasteland .
Though they are not well known outside of San Francisco , they are notorious within this city .
Anyone who questions their beliefs are liable to be threatened or attacked . [ 10 ]
Most people in San Francisco know that they 're crazy and should n't be trusted , " unless you 're mentally feeble or like being screwed over . "
They 're interested only in your money and your soul , and there 's a good chance they 'll destroy the one to get at the other . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
Being based on pseudo - sciences , the technological research - intensive Shi despise the Hubologists and are very open about wanting to decimate them and their deceitful methods .
The vast majority of San Francisco 's population is the Shi so there is little support for the Hubologists here .
Shi townspeople often remark that the Hubologists give them the creeps [ 13 ] and the Shi Emperor 's head advisor Ken Lee accuses them of abducting and brainwashing the Shi , [ 14 ] leading to more tensions between them .
The Hubologists hold the same disdain for the Shi , saying that the Shi are oppressives and by contesting the Hubologist 's power , they wreak havoc among our brethren with their neurodyne - influencing ways . [ 15 ]
Technology Edit
According to Hubologists , " ' real ' science is all a pack of lies , " and people should not listen to what " scientists " say ; only the Hub and AHS - 9 have the answer . [ 16 ]
Despite these sentiments , the Hubologists have Dr. Crockett at their disposal who used his natural affinity for technology to install a nuclear reactor on board the ESS Quetzel as well as develop techniques to harden power armor . [ 17 ]
They have a computer network known as HubLink , which is used to document AHS - 9's goals for the cult , the cult 's outrageous finances , and scientific calculations to get them closer to their Star Father . [ 2 ]
Interactions with the player character Edit
Fallout 2 Edit
In addition to their main base , they also have an outpost in the NCR .
The Chosen One can visit either and receive alignment for a possible Luck and / or Intelligence bonus ( joining the Hubologists afterward is not a requirement ) .
It is possible to receive a penalty instead , so saving beforehand is advised .
Despite the Hubologists ' fervent beliefs , the player character can find evidence that the cult was first started as a hoax to get money .
In San Francisco , the Chosen One has the option of aiding the Hubologists in their mad schemes or eliminating them as part of a Shi mission .
The Hubologists can be encountered again in Nuka - World , where they have set up their Hubologist 's camp .
They desire to repair a broken " UFO " ( which is actually a discarded attraction from Nuka - World ) and they need the aid of the Sole Survivor for this .
Through alignments ( for which increasing amounts of caps must be paid ) , the Sole Survivor can get aligned and increase in AHS - ranking , with a maximum rank of AHS - 8 being achievable .
Each " alignment " destroys so - called " neurodynes " through the use of zeta radiation .
The alignments expose the subject to an increasing amount of rads ( eventually requiring radiation cleansing or equipment with Radiation Resistance to avoid death ) , but also bestow an Intelligence stat bonus for a few in - game days .
The bonuses are cumulative , meaning that receiving all eight alignments back - to - back grants a temporary Intelligence boost of +36 .
With each alignment , the Hubologists will reveal more information on Hubology and their plan .
Alignment table

Sarah Palin ’s secessionist sympathies sparked minor hysteria last week .
Her crime was hailing with round praise the work of the cranky Alaskan Independence Party , which advocates a statewide plebiscite on the secession of Alaska from the Union .
“ The fires of hell are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government , ” the party ’s late founder , gold miner Joe Vogler , once said .
“ And I wo n’t be buried under their damn flag . ”
Palin ’s husband was a member of the AIP for seven years , and Palin herself has courted the AIP for more than a decade .
In an address to the party convention this spring , wearing a ski parka and looking like she was about to decamp into the back country , Palin told the secessionists , “ Keep up the good work . ”
Dexter Clark , the white - bearded vice chairman of the AIP , recently explained the motivation behind the “ good work ” : “ Through oppression , greed , corruption , incompetence and folly , the [ U.S. government ] is forfeiting its moral authority . ”
The thing is , it ’s not just residents of the Last Frontier who favor breaking away from the Union .
According to a Zogby poll conducted in July , more than 20 % of U.S. adults -- one in five , about the same number of American Colonists who supported revolt against England in 1775 -- agreed that “ any state or region has the right to peaceably secede from the United States and become an independent republic . ”
Some 18 % “ would support a secessionist effort in my state . ”
The motivation of these quiet revolutionaries ?
As many as 44 % of those polled agreed that “ the United States ’ system is broken and cannot be fixed by traditional two - party politics and elections . ”
Put this in stark terms :
In a scientific , random sample poll of all Americans , almost half considered the current political system to be in terminal disorder .
One - fifth would countenance a dissolution of the bond .
This is not a hiccup of opinion .
In an October 2006 poll conducted by the Opinion Research Corp. and broadcast on CNN , 71 % of Americans agreed that “ our system of government is broken and cannot be fixed . ”
No surprise that the disquiet finds a voice in popular movements .
In 2007 , a small group of delegates to the second North American secessionist convention -- the first was in Burlington , Vt. , in 2006 -- met in Chattanooga , Tenn. , to discuss how to foment the collapse and destruction of the United States of America .
They came representing 11 rebel groups in 36 states , under banners such as the Republic of Cascadia ( wedding Oregon and Washington ) , Independent California ( forging the world ’s fifth - largest economy ) , the United Republic of Texas ( returning the Lone Star State to its aloneness ) , the League of the South ( uniting the secesh states of old Dixie ) and the Second Vermont Republic ( separating the Green Mountain State from the U.S. ) .
The dominant idea among the delegates was that the U.S. experiment had failed ; it had become impractical , tragically ridiculous , its leaders and institutions bought off , whored out , unaccountable and unanswerable to the needs of citizens .
The United States would have to be reborn smaller -- our loyalties realigned to the needs of localities -- if the American dream was to survive .
The convention presented , in effect , a marriage of progressives , paleo - conservatives , libertarians , Christian separatists , Southern nationalists , all united “ to put an end to the American empire and reestablish freedom and democracy on the state and regional level , ” as organizer Kirkpatrick Sale put it .
The delegates settled on a list of principles they called the Chattanooga Declaration .
“ The deepest questions of human liberty and government facing our time go beyond right and left , and in fact have made the old left - right split meaningless and dead , ” the declaration read .
“ The privileges , monopolies and powers that private corporations have won from government threaten ... health , prosperity and liberty , and have already killed American self - government by the people . ”
The answer , it went on , was that the American states “ ought to be free and self - governing . ”
The Declaration of Independence 250 years earlier asked for a similar dedication to self - governance : " [ W ] henever any form of government becomes destructive ... " wrote Thomas Jefferson , “ it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government .... “
It could be argued that secession is the primal American act , as old as the concept of the states themselves .
What else did our founders accomplish in 1776 but secession from the tyranny of England ?
In other words , what the secessionists would argue is that although they are anti-United States , they are most certainly pro-American .
Secession worries the staid opinion gatekeepers of the major media .
Sarah Palin’s “ flirtation ” with the AIP should make us “ uneasy , ” as Rosa Brooks warned in these pages .
Palin ’s secessionist ties raise “ serious questions , ” averred the New York Times .
A more honest assessment is that the separatism of the Alaskan Independence Party is not so weird or wacky -- or out of keeping with what appears to be a sentiment rooted in that loveliest of American predilections , our crotchety contrarianism .

Fruits , vegetables and animals can be 100 percent organic .
What about people ?
In a fascinating experiment  on himself  Dr. Alan Greene , a pediatrician and author in Danville , Calif. , decided to find out .
For the last three years , Dr. Greene has eaten nothing but organic foods , whether he ’s cooking at home , dining out or snacking on the road .
He chose three years as a goal because that was the amount of time it took to have a breeding animal certified organic by the Department of Agriculture .
While food growers comply with organic regulations every day , Dr. Greene wondered whether a person could meet the same standards .
It has n’t been easy .
“ This is n’t a way of eating I could recommend to anybody else because it ’s so far off the beaten food grid , ” said Dr. Greene , 49 , the founder of a popular Web site about children ’s health , drgreene.com .
“ It was much more challenging than I thought it would be , and I thought it would be tough .
There were definitely days where there was nothing I could find that was organic . ”
Other writers have ventured off the traditional food grid , notably Barbara Kingsolver in “ Animal , Vegetable , Miracle ” and Michael Pollan in “ The Omnivore ’s Dilemma . ”
But what makes Dr. Greene ’s experiment remarkable is the length of time he devoted to it , and his effort to incorporate organic eating into the routines of everyday living .
His findings offer new insight into the challenges facing the organic food industry and those of us who want to patronize it .
Officers from the PSNI ’s serious crime branch are carrying out interviews as part of an investigation into DUP MP Iris Robinson ’s controversial remarks over homosexuality , the Belfast Telegraph can reveal .
The First Minister 's wife caused a storm when she told the House of Commons , during a debate on the assessment and management of sex offenders , that “ there can be no viler act , apart from homosexuality and sodomy , than sexually abusing innocent children ” .
Her comments were made just days after she told a radio programme that homosexuality was an abomination and that gay people could be “ cured ” .
The Belfast Telegraph has learned that serious crime branch detectives have been carrying out active inquiries into the remarks following a number of complaints about incitement to hatred .
It is believed police are investigating if the remarks contravened Article 9 of the Public Order ( NI ) Order 1987 by using threatening , abusive or insulting words which have the likelihood to stir up hatred and arouse fear .
The Belfast Telegraph understands media organisations have been approached this week for assistance in the inquiry .
Legal sources last night said it would be normal practice for police to carry out inquiries following complaints from the public .
It is not known whether Mrs Robinson has yet been spoken to .
A DUP spokesman said last night : “ The DUP is committed to equality and fairness for everyone in Northern Ireland .
Our record in government shows that we are working hard to bring the maximum benefits of devolution to all of Northern Ireland ’s people regardless of their background .
“ Our elected representatives will fulfil all the legal requirements of office and will oppose discrimination against any section of the community but maintain the right of everyone to hold and express their views freely on moral issues according to their conscience . ”
Calls were made for Mrs Robinson ’s resignation from public office following her comments in the House of Commons earlier this year .
When asked by the Belfast Telegraph to clarify the remarks she said that homosexuality was “ comparable ” to child abuse .
As the storm over her comments began to grow she made an apparent U - turn stating that the recording of the debate , which has been published on the Hansard website , did not accurately reflect her views .
In a statement issued through the DUP press office she added : “ I clearly intended to say that child abuse was worse even than homosexuality and sodomy ....
At no point have I set out to suggest homosexuality was worse than child sex abuse . ”
But a Hansard official said that after checking audio recordings , she was satisfied the comments were reported accurately .
Days earlier Mrs Robinson told a radio show that the act of homosexuality was an abomination and that gay people can be “ cured ” .
Her husband , First Minister Peter Robinson , has stood by his wife .

EDMONTON–A residential garage gaining worldwide fame as the site of an alleged movie - inspired murder has become a drive - by shrine for the morbidly curious .
Rubberneckers in cars and on foot have been inching past the white detached structure in the city 's south end since aspiring local filmmaker Mark Twitchell was arrested on Halloween and charged with first - degree murder .
" There are people going by looking in .
They 're going quite slow , " said Lynda Warren , who lives next door to the double - car structure surrounded by junk , a fallen fence and , now , criss - crossed yellow police tape .
Police allege 38 - year - old John Altinger was killed three weeks ago in a manner mirroring the plot of a movie Twitchell , 29 , had just filmed , in which the victim is lured by the promise of an Internet date , tortured for his computer codes , murdered and chopped into pieces .
Yesterday , police said they have located a man who was allegedly lured to the garage on Oct. 3 , a week before Altinger disappeared .
In a statement , police said the man contacted them on Sunday and investigators have interviewed him .
The statement said he " may have been lured by a similar online ad prior to Altinger , but managed to escape . "
The body of Altinger , originally from White Rock , B.C , has not been found .
Twitchell , a married father of two , did not appear in court yesterday as scheduled .
He is set to come before a judge tomorrow to enter a plea .
None of the allegations against him have been proved in court .
Police say the crime has thematic links to the TV show Dexter , which they say Twitchell idolized .
The program on the U.S. - based Showtime network focuses on Dexter Morgan , who studies blood spatters for Miami police by day and psychotically hacks up evildoers vigilante - style by night .
Police allege Altinger was killed after being lured to the garage Oct. 10 by someone pretending to be a woman online and asking him out on a date .
They would n't say yesterday whether they believe the alleged killing was filmed .
They also declined comment on reports Twitchell 's production company – Xpress Entertainment – ordered online a telescopic stun baton capable of delivering 800,000 volts to a victim .
" It 's very upsetting to think a poor man lost his life .
That 's what you keep thinking , " Warren said .
" And I guess it 's upsetting when it 's right beside you and you have no clue what 's going on . "
It ’s so important I ’m reprinting Jo - Ann Mort ’s post on McCain vile campaign against Rashid Khalidi in full …
It has come to this –the red baiting and the nastiness of the McCain / Palin campaign , in desperation to get Jewish support , is now baiting and bad - mouthing a notable Palestinian - American historian , Rashid Khalidi , for his and his wife ’s friendship with Obama .
The Khalidis know Obama from their time in Hyde Park , when Rashid was a professor at the University of Chicago .
Now at Columbia University , he is someone who has always reached out to all sides in the debate about the future of Israel and Palestine .
He has been outspoken in his arguments against Arafat ’s ways of governing and terrorism and when he was at U of C , he was close to Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg , one of the most important American Jewish figures of our time .
For the Republicans to go after him is pure vile–they think that the Jewish vote is so stupid and racist that they will turn away from the Democrats solely on this type of slander .
For someone like Daniel Pipes , quoted in today ’s New York Times story , to call him ‘ marginal , ’ is a joke .
It ’s time to move the Center back to the Center–let ’s hope that happens as of November 5 – for the sake of America , the sake of Israel and the sake of Palestine .
Halloween came and went last week , and we have yet to hear from anyone who wore a Tux costume .
Sigh — looks like we ’ll have to wait another year .
Generating much more excitement than the spooky Linuxy possibilities , it seems , was the grand landing of Intrepid Ibex , which caused a veritable flurry of reviews , comparisons and general Ubuntu - related discussion .
Indeed , more than 2,000 Diggs had been given to news of the big release by Friday , with other lengthy discussions devoted to reviews and Mark Shuttleworth ’s comments about its styling and design .
Better Than Vista !
At least one review found that Ibex is slower than its predecessors , but another found that it still outperforms Vista by far — thank goodness for that !
Too bad , then , that profitability is still a distant dream for Canonical .
Still , things are looking good for Linux in general — so good , in fact , that the Linux Foundation ‘s Jim Zemlin recently predicted that Linux may actually ship on more desktop PCs than Windows or Mac next year , thanks largely to its speedy boot time .
There we have it — so * next * year will be the Year of Linux on the Desktop … !
Ha !
That ’s funny .
Seriously , though , Zemlin ’s comments inspired widespread thought and discussion across the blogs , including the Linux Loop , Desktop Linux and Zemlin ’s own .
Of course , as is usually the case among Linux bloggers , a healthy dose of skepticism was clearly evident .
Not Bloody Likely ?
“ I may disagree here , ” Monochrome Mentality blogger Kevin Dean told LinuxInsider .
“ The ‘ instant - on ’ experience certainly is being pushed for , but in the end , I think the same things that bind users to Windows today will bind them to a slowly booting Windows system . ”
There are “ a lot of Windows PCs that ship , and the sheer numbers alone make it a difficult proposition , even ignoring the end - user ’s response to a non-Windows OS , ” Dean added .
“ My biggest problem with the conclusion is that I doubt instant - on will be mainstream until at least late 2009 , if it catches on , ” wrote Thomas Teisberg on the Linux Loop .
That Linuxy Versatility
On the other hand , “ while there ’s a little tongue - in - cheek , I suspect , this is an interesting development , ” Slashdot blogger yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ I ’d file it under the ‘ more things using Linux than people realize ’ category .
But it is good news — it ’s indicative of how versatile Linux is that BIOS vendors and others are choosing Linux for these kinds of technology tweaks . ”
One result could be to give Linux more exposure in a mainstream setting , yagu added .
“ Maybe we need to find a way to talk about this more publicly … get people asking , ‘ why , if the instant boot is a satisfactory experience for most computer tasks , would n’t Linux be satisfactory in a more full environment ? ' ” he suggested .
“ Of course , then we have to answer that not - so - simple question — but it ’s a start . ”
If nothing else , the notion amplifies the fact that Windows is “ neither nimble nor adaptable enough for these features , ” yagu added .
“ It has a large footprint ( bad for implementation ) and is prohibitively expensive ( bad for community ) and proprietary ( bad for contributions ) . ”
What Free Software Next ?
So , now it ’s clear Linux is going to take over the desktop — perhaps sooner rather than later .
What , then , does the world need in terms of more free software to go along with it ?
That question was recently asked by none other than the Free Software Foundation , which then published its list of the highest - priority free software projects .
Gnash , Coreboot and a free software replacement for Skype were the top three priorities on FSF ’s list , which drew considerable controversy across the blogs .
“ The FSF list includes a number of places where good proprietary software exists for Linux , but there are no good free software alternatives , ” Teisberg noted on the Linux Loop .
“ These free software replacements are important , but I consider it more important to improve free software in cases where there are no good alternatives for Linux , even if those applications are not as commonly used . ”
Right Idea , Wrong Goal
The goal should be “ trying to get more people to run a free operating system , possibly while using some proprietary software on top of the OS , rather than trying to get existing Linux users to use more free software , ” Teisberg added .
Among the projects on Teisberg ’s own proposed list were good video editing software and improved compatibility between Office and Open Office .
“ The free software list is just a demonstration that GNU needs to get its head out of academia and see what the real world is like , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told LinuxInsider .
“ I ’ll agree on the need for video editing , but the rest of that list is too far into the ‘ lets replace this because it ’s not free ’ or only needed by developers and professors . ”
Basic Needs
What do users really need ?
“ Forget replacement BIOS or replacing software that mostly works on Linux , ” Mack advised .
“ We still fall short on basic things that users need for day - to - day work . ”
Top on Mack ’s list ?
First , better network management : “ How about network managers that do n’t make you jump through hoops when you come across wireless with WPA ? ” he suggested .
“ How about some sort of way to make the wireless not start if the machine is already plugged into Ethernet ?
Better yet , how about not attempting DHCP on Ethernet if there is no cable or wireless connection ? ”
Better video drivers take second place on Mack ’s list .
“ Drivers right now seem to be either slow or crap , ” he noted .
“ Even in ATI ’s case , where the documentation is available , there is still no 3D acceleration in the free drivers .
This means that users get the fun choice between ‘ buggy preempt unsafe steaming pile of fecal matter that always seems to lag behind kernel releases ’ or ‘ does n’t do anything we expect of modern video cards . ' ”
‘ A Serious Lack ’
Others viewed the list from a different perspective .
“ This list essentially epitomizes to me why Free Software as a movement is failing to make inroads with ‘ regular people ’ , ” Dean said .
“ Average people do n’t care about the license of their software , and the fact that the FSF has n’t overcome that shows a serious lack , I think . ”
The Skype replacement idea struck Dean as particularly notable .
“ Having once been a Free Software zealot , I pushed Jabber as the ‘ free and easy ’ alternative to the MSN Network , but the simple truth is that open networks are useless if people are n’t using them , ” he said .
“ The FSF claims to not want a Skype - compatible client , but anything other than that does n’t connect Free Software users to the rest of the world , ” much of which is using Skype and “ wo n’t stop until a better ( not defined by the license of the software ) alternative pulls them from it . ”
‘ A Sub -Par Reputation ’
Such mistakes are what give the FOSS ecosystem “ a reputation for being sub- par , ” Dean charged .
“ I do n’t think a quality service / product needs to be closed and restrictive , but it certainly has to be the first solution to a known problem , ” the way Skype was .
“ Rather than spend time replacing tools , the Free Software movement needs to create ‘ in - demand ’ tools and use that as a wedge to promote the ideas of free software rather than spending years and man-hours trying to re-invent the wheel , ” he said .
“ That there is an effort to provide all of these important products for free is laudable , but I would rather prioritize by market demand , ” yagu said .
‘ Lofty , but Misguided ’
“ Some of the demand indeed matches products listed on the priority list ( for example , the Skype replacement and the video editing software ) , but I ’d rather see more coordination and effort on establishing an effective market for selling these products , ” he explained .
“ I know Richard Stallman dictates that all software be free , but in my opinion , the lines blur and some software starts looking like real product — product that I ’m willing to pay for , and I suspect others are too . ”
In short , “ the free software community thinks everyone will just use free software , but human nature defies that logic ; people are willing — even want — to pay for products , ” yagu concluded .
So , the FSF ’s efforts “ are lofty , but I think misguided . ”
And on that note — things that are misguided — it ’s with great sorrow that we must note the recent passing of the inspiring , entertaining and often surprisingly insightful Linux Hater ’s blog .
May its criticisms continue to make Linux better !
" There 's nothing fishy going on in the state of Alaska , " Gail Fenumiai , director of the Alaska Division of Elections , tells us .
Since last week she has been fending off suggestions that the unusually low voter turnout and skewed poll predictions in the state signify some official wickedness or ineptitude .
While 313,592 registered voters showed up for the 2004 presidential election , early counts this year put the turnout at 224,057 .
Fenumiai notes that tens of thousands of absentee and early votes have yet to be tallied .
( States often take a week or two to finish counting absentee and provisional votes and certify elections .
As of yesterday , officials were also still tallying results in Missouri , Georgia , California , Ohio and Virginia . )
More results from those votes will be posted on Wednesday .
Fenumiai expects that turnout will reach around 61 percent of registered voters by the November 19 deadline .
But that ’s still lower than the 66 percent of 2004 .
And this , notes the Anchorage Daily News , came on the heels of huge turnout in the Republican and Democratic caucuses , a gigantic Obama - driven registration campaign , a hometown favorite on the Republican presidential ticket and an incumbent felon in the Senate race .
Adding to the mystery of the missing Alaskan voters , there was the fact that the poll predictions were wrong .
On his number - crunching blog FiveThirtyEight.com , Nate Silver noted that three polls conducted after the conviction of Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) on corruption charges placed him at a considerable disadvantage to his Democratic challenger Mark Begich .
But by at least the counts so far , Stevens was ahead by nearly 3,300 votes .
Likewise , Ethan Berkowitz had a sizable lead over incumbent Rep. Don Young ( R - AK ) , who is under investigation for ties to the same oil company at the heart of the Stevens conviction .
But Young won .
The numbers have left some deeply suspicious .
" I 'm wondering if someone stole the body and blood of this election , " one writer put it on a widely linked Huffington Post piece ( with plenty of exclamation points ) .
" Where are the votes ?
Something stinks at the Alaska Division of Elections . "
But the Democratic Party of Alaska stops short of calling it theft .
" I do n’t really buy into any of the conspiracy theories or anything like that , " says Bethany Lesser , spokesperson for the state party .
" But people in Alaska were n't energized the way the people in the rest of the U.S. were . "
Lesser blames Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , Stevens and Young for turning off independent voters that would otherwise have gone to the polls for them .
But David Dittman , whose Anchorage - based polling group Dittman Research is used by Republicans , says it was more likely the Democratic - leaning voters who stayed home .
Dittman attributes the low turnout to the expectation that Begich and Berkowitz would win handily and the news coverage showing long lines .
" They believed reports of long lines and long waits , and the need to bring a book , " said Dittman .
" And they thought , why endure the discomfort ? "
Dittman also pointed out that his final polls before the election showed Stevens closing in on Begich .
" There 's not much doubt that the election was closing , and Stevens was gaining fast , " he told us .
Others have said that McCain ’s concession speech before the closing of Alaska ’s poll may have had an impact as well .
( And if you ’re wondering about the weather on Election Day , it was five degrees colder than usual in Anchorage . )
So are any lawsuits in the works ?
The Division of Elections has n't heard of them .
And the Democratic Party spokesperson said she was hopeful that the final results would reverse the Stevens win for Begich .
She said that any challenges would wait until after the election is certified on November 25 .

The prison camp at Guantanamo Bay has been controversial since it opened Finally , there is the prospect that the Guantanamo Bay camp will close .
President - elect Barack Obama 's transition team has begun the debate about how this might be done - while stressing that no decisions have yet been taken .
In broad terms , the idea seems to be to abandon the military tribunals authorised under the Military Commissions Act 2006 .
These have begun to get under way at Guantanamo Bay .
A trial procedure would be set up within the United States instead .
At the same time , a renewed effort would be made to find countries willing to take those prisoners already cleared for release .
The first is a legal problem and the second a practical one .
Legal problems
The legal problems involved in trying terrorist suspects have not yet been resolved .
Some say that the prisoners should simply be brought before normal US courts .
It is thought there are about 50 or so prisoners who might face trial , out of the 255 or so in the camp .
A new system would also come under the close scrutiny of the US courts and a case against it would probably go right up to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality
The problem is that evidence against them might have been obtained either through coercion , or even torture , or from foreign agencies which have used similar methods .
Some of this evidence might be admitted in a trial before a military tribunal .
So might hearsay evidence , in which someone relates what he or she was told , if the military judge decides that it would have " probative value to a reasonable person " .
But neither would be acceptable under the normal rules of US courts .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , for example , charged at Guantanamo with responsibility for the 9/11 attacks , was subject to waterboarding .
It is true that he has expressed a wish to die but a civilian court in the US might not admit evidence against him gathered at Guantanamo Bay .
Then what happens ?
It is hard to see him simply being released .
There is also the problem of whether the source of some evidence should be withheld from the prisoner .
Hybrid system
So the idea being floated by one of Barack Obama 's legal advisers , Laurence Tribe , a professor of law at Harvard University , is to explore the possibility of using a mixture of both civilian courts and courts martial .
Guantanamo Bay : search is now on for alternatives
" It would have to be some sort of hybrid legal system , rather than kangaroo courts , " he said .
" I think the answer is going to be , they can be as securely guarded on US soil as anywhere else .
We can't put people in a dungeon forever without processing whether they deserve to be there . "
If the hybrid system under consideration did not distance itself from the military tribunals , it would attract criticism that Guantanamo Bay had simply been transposed to the United States .
A new system would also come under the close scrutiny of the US courts and a case against it would probably go right up to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality .
There is likely to be political and legal opposition to the establishment of any new system for such a few cases .
Practical problems
Meanwhile , the question remains about what to do with the prisoners whose release has been approved .
There is also a further group who are in limbo , with not enough presentable evidence against them nor confidence that they would not take up violence .
Despite considerable efforts , the US has not been able to persuade the home countries of the cleared suspects to have them back .
Often , of course , the prisoners oppose their home governments as much as they do that of the US and are seen a domestic danger .
Five human rights groups have now proposed that those prisoners whose home countries have refused to take them back should be taken in by European governments or the US itself .
Amnesty International 's Daniel Gorevan said : " President - elect Obama has said that he will close [ Guantanamo Bay ] .
Other governments can help make this happen by offering protection to individuals who cannot be released to their own countries . "
Amnesty said that about 50 of the detainees currently held cannot lawfully be sent back to their countries of origin because " they would face a real risk of human rights violations such as torture or other ill - treatment " .
They come from countries including China , Libya , Russia , Tunisia , and Uzbekistan .
" Give us back America " The American Civil Liberties Union called for Barack Obama to announce the closure of Guantanamo Bay on the first day of his presidency .
In a full page advertisement in The New York Times , it said : " Give us back the America we believe in . "
However , the White House , which took years to evolve the current policy after constant legal challenges , has been more sceptical , suggesting that closure was easier said than done .
Spokeswoman Dana Perino said : " We 've tried very hard to explain to people how complicated it is .
When you pick up people off the battlefield that have a terrorist background , it 's not just so easy to let them go .
" These issues are complicated , and we have put forward a process that we think would work in order to put them on trial through military tribunals . "

The great British neurologist John Hughlings - Jackson famously described the ‘ dreamy state ’ reported by some epileptic patients during seizures where they experienced complex hallucinations – sometimes of scenes and faces , feelings of false familiarity and a feeling of ‘ weirdness ’ or ‘ strangeness ’ .
A study published last year in neurology journal Brain re-examined these experiences by deliberately triggering them by electrically stimulating the brain .
The participants were all patients with epilepsy who were having neurosurgery to treat their otherwise untreatable seizures and the researchers , led by neurologist Jean - Pierre Vignal , specifically stimulated areas in the mesial [ inner ] temporal lobes .
The feelings of false familiarity are what we normally called d√©j√† vu , but actually we tend to misapply this term as it means ‘ already seen ’ and refers specifically to a false familiarity for visual perception .
However , it can also occur for anything we experience , such as hearing other people say things , and is more correctly called d√©j√† v√©cu ( ‘ already experienced ’ ) in the literature .
Here are a few of the triggered experiences :
D√©j√† v√©cu ( 3 volts , right amygdala ) – “ It ’s like yesterday evening … I have the impression that everything around me has been here before , that it has already happened , I feel as if I am going backwards in time ” Scene : reliving a parachute jump ( 3.5 volts , right hippocampus ) Familiar television advertisement ( 4 volts , right amygdala ) Impression of being elsewhere ( 3 volts , right hippocampus )
Scene from childhood ( 2 milliamps , right amygdala ) – “ Vision of a bald man dressed in black , coming towards her from behind ; associated with a feeling of imminent death ; she is pale , with piloerection .
She is re-experiencing an experience of anaesthesia by facemask during a tonsillectomy at the age of 14 years ” Impression of being someone else ( 2 milliamps , left amygdala )
Impression of leaving his body ( 2.5 milliamps , left amygdala ) Night - time scene ( 1.2 milliamps , left hippocampus ) – “ I ’m starting to see lots of things , loads of people … it ’s still vague and strange .
I ’ve got an initial picture , a memory … I feel locked in again , something to do with the evening , the night … it ’s strange … .
like after a party , sad things … there is a mixture of last night and this morning … ‚ Äô These remarks were peri-ictal [ during the seizure ] .
After the end of the discharge , there was complete amnesia . ”
Scene ( 4 milliamps , right hippocampus ) – “ It ’s starting , it ’s rising up to my eyes … I ’m always frightened of something … I feel something , like in dreams , I always see people , loads of people , people that I see in the hospital … ” Familiar character from a film ( 1.5 millamps , left amygdala )
Ill - defined , unpleasant vision ( 1.5 milliamps , left hippocampus ) Familiar vision that he is unable to describe ( 1.5 milliamps , left parahippocampal gyrus ) Vision of a familiar person ( 1.5 milliamps , left parahippocampal gyrus ) Recent scene ( 1.5 milliamps , right hippocampus ) – “ I see myself playing the drums , with people from my family listening to me ”

SANTA MONICA , CA -- Important pedestrian safety issues have emerged with the advent of hybrid and electric vehicles .
These vehicles are relatively quiet -- they do not emit the sounds pedestrians and bicyclists are accustomed to hearing as a vehicle approaches them on the street or at an intersection .
In a recent study , human factors / ergonomics researchers examined participants ' preferences for sounds that could be added to quiet vehicles to make them easier to detect .
Though the safety of quiet vehicles has become an issue for pedestrians in general , it is also of concern to the National Federation for the Blind , which has called for quiet vehicles to emit a continuous sound and for additional research on the subject .
The authors suggest that older individuals with diminished sensory and motor skills should also be considered as solutions are developed .
In their paper published in the Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society , 52nd Annual Meeting , Patrick Nyeste and Michael S. Wogalter of North Carolina State University evaluated responses of 24 participants ( mean age = 19.4 years ) to six categories of sounds that might be added to quiet vehicles : engine , horn , hum , siren , whistle , and white noise .
Three variations of each type of sound were tested .
Study participants rated automotive engine sounds by far the preferred category , followed by white noise and hum .
The authors suggest that these categories of sounds rated highly because they are associated with the engine sounds of conventional motor vehicles .
Automakers have continually worked to refine passenger vehicle power trains to be smoother and quieter but now find themselves faced with demands to make their quietest vehicles louder .
Noise pollution caused by adding sounds to these vehicles could be limited by the use of a " smart " system that would change the level of emitted sound depending on the levels of vehicle and background environmental sound .
These systems would turn themselves off if the vehicle produces adequate sound on its own .
At least one automaker , Lotus Engineering , has attempted to address the quiet hybrid issue .
The company introduced " Safe and Sound , " which mimics the sound of an internal combustion engine and operates when the vehicle is in electric - only mode .
The authors note that their research is also applicable to silent - engine vehicles such as electric golf carts , bicycles , wheelchairs , and Segways , which have caused injuries because of their quiet operation .
Research to further define the issues involved and develop possible solutions is being conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , as well as by automobile manufacturers and the Society of Automotive Engineers International .
The U.S. Congress is considering the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2008 , which would require the Secretary of Transportation to study and implement regulations for hybrid , electric , and other silent - engine vehicles to emit nonvisual alerts for pedestrians .

The young man , wearing a shirt and a tie , turned up just as the pantry operated by an Iowa food bank was closing for the night .
He knew it was after - hours .
That ’s why he was there .
He kept his gaze downward as he told the woman from the food bank that he had lost his job , had a wife and kids and was too embarrassed and ashamed to stand in line to receive a bag of groceries that hopefully would feed his family for a week .
I have a master ’s degree .
I should n’t have to do this , he said .
I heard this story last December , a few weeks before the Iowa presidential caucus .
Throughout this election season I talked with professionals and volunteers at food banks and pantries across the country .
The refrain was the same from Oregon to South Carolina , from Maine to Texas : Demand was rising , easily outstripping supply .
More and more new faces were standing in line ; not looking anyone else in the eye , hoping not to be recognized by friends or neighbors .
The bitter irony for some was that once they had contributed to their local food bank .
Now they needed its help .
These people did not fit the stereotype of who comes to a pantry , a shelter or a kitchen .
A lost job , an unexpected medical expense , a utility bill or difficulty paying the rent or mortgage – especially during a period of high food prices – any of these can push people into that line .
The freshest statistics , covering 2007 , were served up this week by the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
An estimated 36.2 million people struggled with some form of hunger ( or , to use the government term , “ food insecurity . ” )
That ’s 12.2 percent of the population – one in eight Americans .
Among them . . . some 691,000 children .
That was last year .
We know what direction the economic arrows point this year .
When he takes office next year , President - elect Obama will have a menu full of priorities .
There should be room for hunger on his plate .
From the perspective of professionals in the field , not enough was said on the campaign trail about hunger .
“ When it comes to the political candidates , invisible is a good word , ” was the assessment from Karen Ford , executive director of the Food Bank of Iowa , who pronounced herself “ tremendously ” disappointed .
“ The folks out there believe that ’s not going to be the topic that ’s going to get them elected , ” said Agostinho “ Augie ” Fernandes , then president of the Gleaners Community Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan .
“ It ’s not sexy enough , ” Fernandes chuckled .
There was hunger even along the generally affluent “ Main Line ” of Philadelphia .
Marlo DelSordo of Philabundance , which operates the city ’s largest food bank , told me about a woman whose husband lost his job as a corporate executive and , like millions of Americans caught in the mortgage industry meltdown , they were “ house poor . ”
Appearing somewhat shell - shocked , this woman never expected to be at a pantry , receiving a handout .
“ People do n’t associate people in the suburbs with hunger , ” DelSordo says .
“ But so many of the people that we help , they ’re trying ” even with jobs and education , to keep food on the table .
Naomi Schalit , opinion editor of the Kennebec Journal , authored a remarkable series of articles about hunger in Maine .
The six months Schalit spent last year meeting the hungry and visiting food banks and pantries , changed her life .
“ I was guilt wracked .
Here I was spending as much on one meal as some of these people had to feed themselves for a day or longer , ” she told me .
Schalit noticed the amount of food left uneaten at restaurants .
At the grocery , she marveled at the variety , but was critical of “ the energy spent in this insane , ridiculous diversity . . .
I mean , who needs 14 kinds of oat flakes ?
We can do all this , but we ca n’t feed our people , ” Schalit lamented .
Schalit ’s heroes included Nancy Marcoux , director of the Fairfield Interfaith Food Pantry at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Fairfield .
The 63 - year - old Marcoux remembered when Mainers were more self - sufficient .
But now more and more people around her – people with jobs , with educations , but with diminished opportunities , resources and hope – were struggling .
“ They ’ll come in and say , ‘ I never thought in my life that I ’d have to come to a food pantry , ’ ” Marcoux told Schalit .
Yes , millions of tax dollars are spent to feed the hungry – by supplying food banks with surplus farm commodities , through the food stamp programs and by other means .
Yes , the food industry – which has become increasingly efficient , producing less excess – provides local communities with sizeable donations .
Yes , millions of Americans give not only money and food – but also their time .
Volunteers often are as welcome as canned goods .
But the number of people in line grows steadily .
The dedicated folks who work at food banks and the agencies they serve see the human faces that represent those numbers .
They know that Thanksgiving compels more private citizens and businesses to make donations .
And they know their local news media will report on efforts to feed the less fortunate .
They just hope that after Thanksgiving the faces in those lines wo n’t be forgotten .
Because hunger takes no holidays .

Many of us have a sense for physical units like 750 mL , 12 ounces , or a six - pack .
But what does it mean to have an infinite size ?
The math is fascinating .
Perhaps the most remarkable result is that infinity is not a single size .
One can talk intelligently about different sizes or types of infinity .
This was first and famously demonstrated by Georg Cantor in the late 1800s , in work that laid groundwork for the field of set theory .
Set theory is one of my favorite subjects , but perhaps it is not for everyone .
Luckily there is another way to approach infinity because of a new proof using game theory .
What is the size of a set of objects ?
Size is the most basic property of a set .
It is the number of objects in a set .
We refer to the size of a set when we say things like “ there are 5 people in front of me ” or “ a theater has 200 seats . ”
Sometimes we do not care about absolute size but instead comparative size .
For instance , in an election , it is most important to know which candidate gets more votes .
What we usually do is count the number of votes for each side and then make a comparison .
But amazingly we do n’t have to count to compare the size of two things .
My favorite set theory textbook has the explanation of why :
To see how this is done , consider the problem of determining whether the set of all patrons of some theater performance has the same number of elements as the set of all seats .
To find the answer , the ushers need not count the patrons or the seats .
It is enough if they check that each patron sits in one , and only one seat , and each set is occupied by one , and only one , theatergoer .
( source : Introduction to Set Theory by Karel Hrback and Thomas Jech , Third Edition )
In essence , comparing size is equivalent to the process of pairing elements .
If elements from two sets pair up exactly one - for - one , then the sets are the same size .
If one set has unpaired elements ( say unfilled seats ) , then it is bigger .
This is common sense when dealing with finite sets , but things get nuanced and defy physical logic when we analyze infinite sets .
Countably infinite
The numbers we count with ( the set of numbers { 1 , 2 , 3 , …} ) are called natural numbers .
The set keeps on going forever and so there are an infinite number of elements .
Because we can “ count ” how many objects are in the set , the set ’s size is described as being countably infinite .
How do other sets compare in size ?
The surprising part is that many sets are also countably infinite , even though they would first appear to be smaller or larger .
We have to use the pairing process and not our intuition to decide the size .
For instance , consider the set of numbers { 2 , 3 , 4 , …} , that is , the natural numbers except for 1 .
Though this set has one element missing , it is in fact the same size as the natural numbers .
The reason is it can be paired up exactly one - for - one with the natural numbers .
Every number n from the natural numbers gets paired with the number n + 1 from this new set .
Since both sets keep going on indefinitely , the pairing is proper and works .
Hence the new set , though seemingly smaller , is also countably infinite .
The result can be hard to swallow in a physical sense .
Imagine an infinite theater with seats labeled with the natural numbers that is originally full with people .
The set { 2 , 3 , 4 , …} can be thought of physically as the seating arrangement of people if we asked the first person to leave the theater and then asked everyone to move back one seat .
The theater would somehow still be full despite losing one person .
And even more strange is that if the first person returns , we could clear the first seat by asking everyone to move up one seat .
One mathematician , Hilbert , presented many other similar paradoxes of the infinite .
He used an infinite hotel and so such problems fall under Hilbert ’s Hotel paradox .
The physical analogies make the math seem absurd , but in fact everything is sound and well - derived .
So I keep myself straight by thinking about things as abstract pairings .
Other sets are also countably infinite , even though they too seem to be of different size .
The even numbers are exactly the same size as the natural numbers , as each number n can be paired with 2n .
Similarly , the odd numbers are countably infinite , and so is any infinite subset of the natural numbers , like the prime numbers .
Amazingly the set of rational numbers –the fractions of natural numbers ( and their negatives ) –is also countably infinite .
Here is one illustration of how you can “ count ” the fractions .
At this point every set we have come up with is countably infinite .
So it ’s worth asking : are there any sets bigger ?
It turns out there are bigger sets that are “ uncountably ” infinite .
This is where the game theory proof comes in .
Game theory : proof of the uncountably infinite
Matthew Baker at the Georgia Institute of Technology created a novel game to show a certain set is uncountably infinite .
If you want the details from Baker , you can read the original paper pdf .
I ’ll summarize the proof below .
The game involves two - players , Alice and Bob , picking numbers on the interval [ 0,1 ] –the set of real numbers ( all the decimals ) between the numbers 0 and 1 .
Here are the rules :
Alice initially picks some subset S of the interval [ 0,1 ] .
Alice starts the game by picking a number a 1 between 0 and 1 .
Bob then picks a number b 1 bigger than Alice ’s choice a 1 but less than 1 .
Alice then picks a number a 2 bigger than her previous choice a 1 but less than Bob ’s previous choice b 1 .
In general , Alice and Bob alternate picking numbers between the two previous numbers played .
That is , on turn n Alice has to pick a number a n such that a n - 1 < a n < b n - 1 and Bob has to pick a number b n such that a n < b n < b n - 1 .
A famous theorem guarantees that the sequence of numbers a 1 , a 2 , … converges to a number .
Call this number X . If X is in the set S , then Alice wins .
Otherwise Bob wins .
The proof that [ 0,1 ] is uncountably infinite
Baker ’s proof has three parts :
If S is countably infinite , then Bob has a winning strategy .
Alice can always win the game .
The set [ 0,1 ] is uncountable .
Here are the details on the individual steps .
1 . If S is countably infinite , then Bob has a winning strategy .
Imagine the set S is countably infinite .
Then the set can be enumerated as s 1 , s 2 , and so on ( like seats in an infinite theater ) .
It turns out Bob can always make sure that the sequence does not converge to any of these values .
That is , Bob can make sure X does not equal any s n .
Here ’s the strategy : on turn n , Bob picks s n if it is a legal move , and otherwise picks anything .
This will guarantee it .
Why ?
If Bob does get to pick s n , then he forces the remaining numbers to be smaller than s n so the sequence cannot converge to s n .
On the other hand , if Bob can not pick s n , then he can pick any legal move .
The only reason Bob could not pick s n is if Alice has already picked a number higher than s n .
Accordingly , the remaining numbers picked in the game will be larger than s n so the sequence would converge a number larger than s n .
Thus Bob can just pick any allowable number on this turn and continue .
Bob can continue this strategy to make sure that the sequence never converges to any element of S .
This means X would not be in S and Bob would win .
In summary , if S is countably infinite , Bob can always win the game .
Unfortunately , the odds are stacked against Bob .
2 . Alice can always win the game .
Alice can pick S to be any subset of the interval [ 0,1 ] .
This means
Alice can pick the entire subset [ 0,1 ] –cheap , yes , but effective .
Since Alice and Bob are always picking numbers between 0 and 1 , the sequence must converge in the interval .
Hence Alice can always win the game .
3 . The set [ 0,1 ] is uncountably infinite .
This follows directly !
By point 1 , if [ 0,1 ] were countably infinite , then Bob could win the game .
But by point 2 he cannot win , and therefore the set [ 0,1 ] must be larger and uncountably infinite .

What ’s the most downloaded catalog track in iTunes history ?
Before you jump out your seat and guess ‘ Jack Johnson ’ , keep in mind that a catalog track refers to a song released in the pre-digital era , but later re-released as a digital download .
So any guesses ?
Here ’s a hint : think Power Ballads .
Well , it turns out that the most downloaded catalog track in iTunes history is actually “ Do n’t Stop Believin ” by Journey .
In fact , it ’s the first catalog song to ever reach 2 Million in digital sales .
Originally released in 1981 , the song topped the Billboard charts at # 8 .
The song , however , has made a modern day comeback and has become something of a pop culture phenomenon after being featured on popular TV shows such as Laguna Beach , and more famously on The Sopranos .
In fact , after the song was featured on the last episode of The Sopranos , sales of the song on iTunes increased by over 428 % in just 3 days .
SoundScan has the full scoop over here .
And below , check out the final scene from The Sopranos .

Editor 's Note : Donna Brazile , a Democratic strategist , serves as a political contributor for CNN .
She also serves as the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee 's Voting Rights Institute , an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and founder of Brazile & Associates , a Washington - based political consulting firm .
Brazile , who served as the campaign manager for the Al Gore - Joe Lieberman ticket in 2000 , wrote " Cooking with Grease : Stirring the Pots in American Politics , " a memoir about her life in politics .
Donna Brazile says ACORN is dedicated to supporting social justice and better communities .
( CNN ) --
Our nation 's economic foundation is crumbling like sand beneath our feet .
Middle - class families are losing their jobs , homes , savings accounts and college funds .
Retirement nest eggs are fried to a crisp .
Nine million children in America do n't have health care coverage .
We 're fighting wars on more fronts than we can handle .
And John McCain is talking about ACORN ?
Just as a top McCain adviser admitted that his candidate would n't campaign on the economy because it's a losing issue , so too it seems that the GOP has made a collective decision to abandon any real discussion of the issues in favor of distortion and distraction .
Through its 850 neighborhood chapters in more than 100 cities across the United States , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now organizes the powerless to work together for social justice and stronger communities through affordable housing , quality education and better public services .
They are dedicated to looking out for those with little means in our society .
In the world of some elites , low - and moderate - income families and the organizations that work to empower them are the bad guys .
There is all - out class warfare going on here , folks .
Another example of it is how people in the low - income bracket are being blamed for the subprime market crash -- rather than the unscrupulous lenders who redirected them from the fixed 30 - year prime rates they could have paid to the subprime and adjustable rate mortgages destined to implode .
The victims are revictimized .
It is an unfortunate reality that " poor " and " racial minority " are invariably overlapping circles in a Venn diagram .
But the class animosity now being bred is , as it always has been , a cover for racial antipathy .
And , make no mistake , this is exactly what 's going on here .
How pathetic and immoral in the face of the challenges we must confront as a nation .
Experts who have examined the allegations against ACORN have concluded that there is no significant threat of voter fraud .
For the fraudulent registration forms to turn into fraudulent votes , they would have had to get through the election officials ' vetting systems and make it onto the voter rolls .
Next , someone would need to arrive at the assigned polling location with valid identification that lists the same name and address as the fraudulent registration .
( This is fairly difficult to do if you 're dead or named Mickey Mouse . )
Then , having passed all these hurdles , that someone would cast a vote that will cost him or her 10 years in jail .
Just find me someone willing to spend 10 years in jail just for a chance to vote for Obama or McCain ?
Let 's look at the facts .
ACORN labeled as " suspicious " the fraudulent registration forms a few of its paid volunteers submitted .
Moreover , ACORN delivered them to election authorities under that heading .
ACORN offered to help election officials pursue prosecutions against those who filled out the fraudulent forms .
The so - called ACORN scandal is no more than a few canvassers trying to meet their quota and make easy money by cheating the system .
Ask yourself how likely is it that someone would go through the effort and risk of submitting multiple false registration forms , find an accomplished forger capable of producing IDs of sufficient quality to trick election officials , and then spend Election Day racking up a couple extra votes at the potential cost of spending a decade in jail ?
A simple cost - benefit analysis tells us this is not a reasonable or significant threat .
The real threat here is the Republican Party using attacks on ACORN as a calculated strategy to justify massive challenges to the votes cast in Democratic - leaning voting precincts on Election Day .
And this is what is truly outrageous , but where is John McCain 's concern when it comes to people being harassed at the voting booth ?
The same Republican Party shouting " Voter fraud ! " is also furiously trying to prevent Ohio from registering voters at early voting sites and suing to shut down some early voting sites in Indiana .
Just as the GOP will use the so - called " Bradley effect " to explain away voting irregularities it created through voter suppression , it will use allegations of voter fraud to cover its efforts of voter suppression .
McCain and Republican candidates up and down the GOP ticket do n't want increased voter turnout .
Let them sputter and fret .
A swelling of the voter rolls strengthens our democracy .
The more eligible voters we have participating in the process , the stronger we are as a nation -- and the more accurately the results on November 4 will reflect our nation 's choice for president .
We must be vigilant in protecting people 's right to vote , not vigilant in suppressing it .
We must be vigilant that new voters are n't threatened , harassed or turned away .
And we must be vigilant that resources like voting machines and poll workers are distributed appropriately to accommodate the projected influx of new voters .
Finally , we must be vigilant that this election , unlike 2000 or 2004 , does n't return conspicuous voting irregularities , and that those irregularities are n't left unchallenged .
We must be vigilant in the protection of our democracy because the way things are going in the United States right now , democracy may be the only valuable left in our national treasury .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile .

Spore has seen its share of disgruntled customers over the game 's use of some very intrusive DRM , but now more gamers have started to seek a legal remedy to their problems with SecuROM .
At the end of September a class - action lawsuit was filed claiming that SecuROM did everything but set the users ' houses on fire , and now two more class - action lawsuits have been filed against EA .
The first lawsuit was filed by Richard Eldridge , and concerned the use of SecuROM in the free version of the game 's Creature Creator .
" Consumers are given no notices whatsoever that the FREE trial version of the game includes Digital Rights Management technology ...
Consumers are given no control , rights , or options over SecuROM , " the suit alleges .
" The program can not be completely uninstalled . "
The suit then lists some of the software that SecuROM looks for , including the Fantom CD Emulator , Alcohol 120 % , Nero Image Drive , and Daemon Tools , among others .
" EA , by virtue of its secret instalaltion of SecuROM , has determined that it should have control over which programs a user may utilize or run on ttheir computer ... " the suit claims .
The suit asks for relief in the form of payment to have SecuROM removed from the computers of class members , and the restitution of " all unlawful or illegal profits recieved by defendant as a result of the unfair , unlawful , and / or deceptive conduct alleged in herein . "
The second class - action suit deals with claims of damage due to SecuROM " after suffering months of computer problems and ultimately having to reformat her hard drive to rid her computer of SecuROM and its accompanying problems . "
The suit seeks to keep EA from selling games witih SecuROM , unless proper disclosure and removal tools are included .
While we pointed out that it's hard to prove that the myriad problems described by the plaintiff were all due to SecuROM when looking at the previous lawsuit , these new complaints appear to be a bit more grounded in reality .
They bring up the lack of disclosure about SecuROM in the game 's EULA , the fact the program is n't shown in the " Add / Remove Programs " utility in Windows , and the lack of an easily found uninstall utility for SecuROM .
The problems listed in the suit included " prevention of proper launching of games ... disruption of antivirus programs and firewalls , computer slowdowns ... and complete operating system failure . "
The suit then says the only way to remove the program is a complete reformat and install .
In legal terms , the allegation is that you need to nuke the installation from orbit .
It 's the only way to be sure .
Ars had some misgivings about the past class - action lawsuit on this issue , simply because the claims of damages were so broad and hard to prove .
The language and allegations of these two suits , which deal with the Creature Creator as well as a copy of The Sims 2 : Bon Voyage , are much clearer and to the point : SecuROM is installed with inadequate disclosure , and it is hard to remove without downloading an uninstaller , which EA does offer from its web site .
While DRM will always be around in one form or another , hopefully lawsuits such as these will make companies like EA be more forthcoming about what programs will be installed along with their games , and how you can get rid of them .

We all know that eating fish can be good for us .
The protein , the Omega 3s , the mercury .
Er , well maybe not the mercury .
That part can be fairly dangerous actually , especially for children and pregnant women .
Yet according the Washington Post the FDA is urging the government to tell us to eat more fish , mercury risks be damned .
If approved by the White House , the FDA ’s position would reverse the government ’s current policy that certain groups — women of childbearing years , pregnant women , nursing mothers , infants and children — can be harmed by the mercury in fish and should limit their consumption .
The FDA ’s recommendations have alarmed scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency , who in internal memos criticized them as “ scientifically flawed and inadequate ” and said they fell short of the “ scientific rigor routinely demonstrated by EPA . ”
It is a bit frightening that the FDA wants to ignore the risks of mercury poisoning from fish .
The neurological damage that can happen to fetuses exposed to high levels of mercury is severe .
This is why previous limits on the types and amount of fish pregnant women should consume have been put into place .
That the FDA would begin their proposal without consulting with the EPA early in the draft process makes a person wonder if there is some alternative reason for this .
And I ’m not alone is questioning the FDA .
“ This is an astonishing , irresponsible document , ” said Richard Wiles , the environmental group ’s executive director .
“ It ’s a commentary on how low FDA has sunk as an agency .
It was once a fierce protector of America ’s health , and now it ’s nothing more than a patsy for polluters . ”
The most recent statement on fish from both the FDA and the EPA was in 2004 .
They recommended that no moe than 12 ounces of low mercury fish and shellfish be eaten each week .
They advised eating shrimp , canned light tuna , salmon , pollock , and catfish as they are all low mercury , where as Shark , Swordfish , King Mackerel , and Tilefish should be avoided .

VITILIGO NEWS
Self diagnose is common to many of them realizing that it could help them out rapidly without knowing the symptoms of any ailments or reactions caused to them .
Therefore , practicing of such dangerous and harmful to one ’s health condition should be avoided as they may lead to a misdiagnosis .
The best advice and recommendations could only be consulted with the qualified medical profession .
In the case of vitiligo we have seen in many cases that they get into trouble after treating with their own decision or self diagnosis .
We have notice that they use puncturing of skin through syringe or needle on the affected areas of white patches .
They will differentiate the cause of vitiligo by means of “ prick test ” or “ puncture test ” with the needle or syringe into the affected areas of white patches .
If the response shows with the fluids flowing into the syringe or found they will be considered as a vitiligo patient whereas the blood proves to them as a normal patient .
These tests are not recommended nor recognized either in terms of scientific method or medically acceptable .
Therefore self diagnosis is indeed extremely dangerous to your health .
The results of having such testing will get a person into more complex problems like hepatitis or skin disorder and infections .
Therefore , without knowing the causes of the ailments will need a careful study and recognizing of problems before getting a proper treatment .
No one knows about the bacteria , virus or any other invisible developments on the affected areas of white patches if use un-sterilized syringe or needle can worsen further and further .
In some of the cases like allergy having rash or skin disorder may cause by consuming sensitive foods in - compatible with each other .
There are many allergy cases found in most part of the world due to the cause of eating hypersensitive foods like peanuts , tree nuts , eggs , milk , shellfish , fish , wheat and their derivatives , soy and their derivatives , chemical compositions such as sulfites that they are one of the based materials used in the formation of food flavors and colors .
Although it is important to have a balance diet but there are many chances of developing Allergy if the compatible of foods does match to each other .
Mackerel a fish known for its taste is good if not taken with the milk .
The reactions of having milk and fish will turn your skin into allergic conditions and at the same time you will find white patches on the skin .
These problems can be developed within no time .
As we have discussed earlier about the self diagnosis we would be happier to advice to take foods which should not make any contra-indications like stated above .
Least and last the better you take care of applying or testing of your ailments on self diagnosis basis should be avoided whether or not they are indeed desperate and desirous .

New rides for lawmakers from cash - poor state 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
California 's multibillion - dollar deficit has n't stopped the state from shelling out an estimated $ 1.3 million to keep 40 new and returning lawmakers rolling in style during these toughest of times .
Nearly all 28 of the newly sworn - in members of the Assembly , plus several of the 52 holdovers , have leased new wheels through the state - at a cost well below what the average wage slave pays at the dealer .
On the Senate side , nine of the 11 new members - all of whom just moved over from the Assembly - picked up new rides along with their new titles .
Among them , San Francisco Democrat Mark Leno , who has a new , $ 32,000 Toyota Camry hybrid .
Contra Costa County 's newly minted Sen. Mark DeSaulnier and fellow Democrat Joe Simitian of Palo Alto both have new , $ 34,000 Nissan Altimas .
While most members have gone hybrid green with their car selections , there 's one notable exception .
Republican Sen. Bob Huff of Diamond Bar ( Los Angeles County ) , who proudly declares on his Web site that he has led the fight to cut government waste and has never voted for a tax increase , ordered himself a brand - new , 2008 Cadillac CTS - priced at $ 46,000 .
Under government rules , the legislators lease their vehicles from the state with the help of a monthly $ 350 to $ 500 auto allowance .
The amount varies based on the lease terms and whether the member serves in the Assembly or Senate .
Any costs above that come out of the legislators ' pockets - which , in the case of the Senate , is anywhere from $ 35 a month for a new Chevy Malibu hybrid to $ 280 for a Lexus hybrid .
Of course , lawmakers also get free gas and maintenance .
Legislators routinely trade in their cars after their leases expire - usually around 75,000 miles - at which point the cars are sold off for no more than a third of their original value , with the state getting the proceeds .
Contra Costa Sen.- turned -Assemblyman Tom Torlakson 's 2000 Chevy Camaro sold for $ 6,000 , and the 2005 Lincoln Town Car driven by termed - out Democratic Sen. Edward Vincent of Inglewood ( Los Angeles County ) fetched $ 11,000 .
As for Huff , he said he was happy to dump the Ford Explorer he had been driving in the Assembly because " frankly , it was a piece of junk . "
" I understand the perception that I 'm driving a Cadillac , " Huff told us by cell phone Friday , stuck in a Southern California traffic jam in his new red wheels .
But it 's hardly top of the line , he says , and it still costs him $ 200 out of his own pocket .
" At least I 'm buying American , " he said .
" But I 'll take my hits and move on . "
Hot call : Once again , San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin has gotten himself in the middle of a phone fight - this time with former Supervisor Angela Alioto .
To hear Alioto tell it : " He calls me up at 9 at night , at my home , and tells me : ' Who do you f-ing think you are ?
If you do n't stop what you are doing , I 'm going to ruin your life . ' "
To which Alioto said she replied : " Listen , you little twerp .
Do n't threaten me or even try to threaten me . "
Then she hung up .
Peskin confirmed making the call , but said Alioto 's version of the brief conversation was " a complete fabrication . "
" All I said was , ' I would like you to stop spreading false statements about myself and my wife , ' " Peskin said .
Alioto and others have been raising the roof in North Beach over the pull that Peskin - and his wife , Nancy Shanahan , of the politically powerful Telegraph Hill Dwellers Association - seem to have when it comes to getting building permits in the neighborhood .
The latest spat was over the shrine to St. Francis of Assisi that Alioto is building onto the North Beach church of the same name - and the Planning Department 's refusal to issue her all the permits .
" Peskin controls the budget at the Planning Department .
He pulls strings like you would n't believe , " Alioto said .
" You go down to there to get a permit , and the first thing they say is , ' You need a letter from Peskin 's wife , Nancy Shanahan . '
Who made her so powerful ?
" I 've had 30 North Beach businesses in my office wanting to sue " over the couple 's alleged misuse of Peskin 's city power , said lawyer Alioto .
" Not true , " Peskin shot back .
" And that is why I called her .
Angela is the bully .
She 's the one bullying the neighborhood , and it is conduct unbecoming . "
Maybe , but this is n't the first time we 've reported about Peskin 's phone calls - and we doubt it will be the last .
Budget blues :
One of the big - ticket items contributing to San Francisco 's budget crisis is the $ 70 million in annual raises due to be handed out before July 1 that Mayor Gavin Newsompromised to nearly all 27,000 city workers before his re-election .
Police and firefighters , for instance , are in line for a 7 percent pay hike , and members of the Service Employees International Union - who account for half the city 's workforce - are due for a 3.75 percent kick up .
The raises help explain why the city is facing an immediate shortage of as much as $ 125 million , with a lot more to come next year .
As of Friday , none of the unions had volunteered any salary give - backs or freezes - nor was the mayor 's office asking them to make any concessions .
Newsom went to the unions for help just a few months back , with minimal results .
Now , the mayor is demanding that all city departments cut their budgets by 7 percent .
And the mayor is especially aiming his ax at the offices of independently elected City Attorney Dennis Herrera , District Attorney Kamala Harris and Public Defender Jeff Adachi - most of whose combined 432 attorneys earn more than $ 100,000 a year each .
The biggest money makers are in Herrera 's shop , where 35 lawyers each makes between $ 175,000 and $ 197,000 , city records show .
Herrera said it 's silly " to scapegoat any class of employees " when the city 's annual budget has swelled to $ 6 billion , and he points out that his office has been making - do with 41 fewer attorneys than his predecessor .
" I'm a team player , " Herrera said , " and I recognize that we all have to pull together to do our part .
And I plan on doing so . "

Colbert : McCain will be next president ... of Fox News David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Friday October 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Stephen Colbert satirized Sen. John McCain 's allegations during the final presidential debate Wednesday night that his opponent is involved with a group that could " destroy the fabric of democracy " through voter fraud .
Colbert said he is tired of people claiming NSA wiretapping , condoning torture or increased power in the executive branch is endangering democracy , when the real culprit is obviously a grassroots organization called ACORN .
" It was actually destroyed by homeless people filling out registration forms with the name Mickey Mouse , " Colbert said .
The talk - show host was referring to bogus registration forms filled out by members of ACORN sent to sign up voters in minority and poor neighborhoods , the Associated Press reported .
Donald Duck and the entire starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys football team also appeared on voter registration forms in Nevada .
Democrats have accused the GOP of making the allegations as a desperate attempt to reduce the huge number of newly registered Democratic voters from getting to the polls .
As McCain continue to trail behind Obama in every poll except the ones on Fox News , Colbert said that he 's " ready to call it now . "
" John McCain is going to be the next president of Fox News , " Colbert said .

With a record amount of commercial real - estate debt coming due , some of the country 's biggest property developers have become the latest to go hat - in - hand to the government for assistance .
They 're warning policymakers that thousands of office complexes , hotels , shopping centers and other commercial buildings are headed into defaults , foreclosures and bankruptcies .
The reason : according to research firm Foresight Analytics LCC , $ 530 billion of commercial mortgages will be coming due for refinancing in the next three years -- with about $ 160 billion maturing in the next year .
Credit , meanwhile , is practically nonexistent and cash flows from commercial property are siphoning off .
Unlike home loans , which borrowers repay after a set period of time , commercial mortgages usually are underwritten for five , seven or 10 years with big payments due at the end .
At that point , they typically need to be refinanced .
A borrower 's inability to refinance could force it to give up the property to the lender .
A recent letter sent to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , and signed by a dozen real - estate trade groups , painted a bleak scenario : " Right now , we believe there is insufficient systemic capacity to refinance expiring , performing commercial real - estate loans , " said the letter .
" For many borrowers , [ credit ] simply is not available , " the letter noted .
To head off some of the impending pain , the industry is asking to be included in a new $ 200 billion loan program initially created by the government to salvage the market for car loans , student loans and credit - card debt .
This money is intended to go directly to help investors finance purchases of securities backed by these assets .
If commercial real estate is included , banks might have an incentive to make more loans to developers since they'd be able to repackage and sell them more easily to investors with the assurance of government backing .
I drive an American car .
It 's a Chrysler .
That 's not an endorsement .
It 's more like a cry for pity .
And now for a decades - old story , retold ad infinitum by tens of millions of Americans , half of whom have had to desert their country to simply find a damn way to get to work in something that wo n't break down :
My Chrysler is four years old .
I bought it because of its smooth and comfortable ride .
Daimler - Benz owned the company then and had the good grace to place the Chrysler chassis on a Mercedes axle and , man , was that a sweet ride !
When it would start .
More than a dozen times in these years , the car has simply died .
Batteries have been replaced , but that was n't the problem .
My dad drives the same model .
His car has died many times , too .
Just wo n't start , for no reason at all .
Let me just state the obvious :
Every single dollar Congress gives these three companies will be flushed right down the toilet .
A few weeks ago , I took my Chrysler in to the Chrysler dealer here in northern Michigan — and the latest fixes cost me $ 1,400 .
The next day , the vehicle would n't start .
When I got it going , the brake warning light came on .
And on and on .
You might assume from this that I could n't give a rat 's ass about these miserably inept crapmobile makers down the road in Detroit city .
But I do care .
I care about the millions whose lives and livelihoods depend on these car companies .
I care about the security and defense of this country because the world is running out of oil — and when it runs out , the calamity and collapse that will take place will make the current recession / depression look like a Tommy Tune musical .
And I care about what happens with the Big 3 because they are more responsible than almost anyone for the destruction of our fragile atmosphere and the daily melting of our polar ice caps .
Congress must save the industrial infrastructure that these companies control and the jobs they create .
And it must save the world from the internal combustion engine .
This great , vast manufacturing network can redeem itself by building mass transit and electric / hybrid cars , and the kind of transportation we need for the 21st century .
And Congress must do all this by NOT giving GM , Ford , and Chrysler the $ 34 billion they are asking for in " loans " ( a few days ago they only wanted $ 25 billion ; that 's how stupid they are — they do n't even know how much they really need to make this month 's payroll .
If you or I tried to get a loan from the bank this way , not only would we be thrown out on our ear , the bank would place us on some sort of credit rating blacklist ) .
Two weeks ago , the CEOs of the Big 3 were tarred and feathered before a congressional committee who sneered at them in a way far different than when the heads of the financial industry showed up two months earlier .
At that time , the politicians tripped over each other in their swoon for Wall Street and its Ponzi schemers who had concocted Byzantine ways to bet other people 's money on unregulated credit default swaps , known in the common vernacular as unicorns and fairies .
But the Detroit boys were from the Midwest , the Rust ( yuk ! )
Belt , where they made real things that consumers needed and could touch and buy , and that continually recycled money into the economy ( shocking ! ) , produced unions that created the middle class , and fixed my teeth for free when I was ten .
For all of that , the auto heads had to sit there in November and be ridiculed about how they traveled to D.C.
Yes , they flew on their corporate jets , just like the bankers and Wall Street thieves did in October .
But , hey , that was OK !— they ’re the Masters of the Universe !
Nothing but the best chariots for Big Finance as they set about looting our nation 's treasury .
Of course , the auto magnates used to be the Masters who ruled the world .
They were the pulsating hub that all other industries — steel , oil , cement contractors — served .
Fifty - five years ago , the president of GM sat on that same Capitol Hill and bluntly told Congress that what 's good for General Motors is good for the country .
Because , you see , in their minds , GM was the country .
What a long , sad fall from grace we witnessed on November 19 , when the three blind mice had their knuckles slapped and then were sent back home to write an essay called " Why You Should Give Me Billions of Dollars of Free Cash . "
They were also asked if they would work for a dollar a year .
Take that !
What a big , brave Congress they are !
Requesting indentured servitude from ( still ) three of the most powerful men in the world .
This from a spineless body that wo n't dare stand up to a disgraced president nor turn down a single funding request for a war that neither they nor the American public support .
Amazing .
Let me just state the obvious :
Every single dollar Congress gives these three companies will be flushed right down the toilet .
There is nothing the management teams of the Big Three are going to do to convince people to go out during a recession and buy their big , gas - guzzling , inferior products .
Just forget it .
And , as sure as I am that the Ford family - owned Detroit Lions are not going to the Super Bowl — ever — I can guarantee you , after they burn through this $ 34 billion , they 'll be back for another $ 34 billion next summer .
So what to do ?
Members of Congress , here 's what I propose :
1. Transporting Americans is and should be one of the most important functions our government must address .
And because we are facing a massive economic , energy , and environmental crisis , the new president and Congress must do what Franklin Roosevelt did when he was faced with a crisis ( and ordered the auto industry to stop building cars and instead build tanks and planes ) :
The Big 3 are , from this point forward , to build only cars that are not primarily dependent on oil and , more important , to build trains , buses , subways , and light rail ( a corresponding public works project across the country will build the rail lines and tracks ) .
This will not only save jobs , but create millions of new ones .
2 . You could buy all the common shares of stock in General Motors for less than $ 3 billion .
Why should we give GM $ 18 billion or $ 25 billion or anything ?
Take the money and buy the company !
( You 're going to demand collateral anyway if you give them the " loan , " and because we know they will default on that loan , you 're going to own the company in the end as it is .
So why wait ?
Just buy them out now . )
3 . None of us want government officials running a car company , but there are some very smart transportation geniuses who could be hired to do this .
We need a Marshall Plan to switch us off oil - dependent vehicles and get us into the 21st century .
This proposal is not radical or rocket science .
It just takes one of the smartest people ever to run for the presidency to pull it off .
What I 'm proposing has worked before .
The national rail system was in shambles in the '70s .
The government took it over .
A decade later it was turning a profit , so the government returned it to private / public hands , and got a couple billion dollars put back in the treasury .
This proposal will save our industrial infrastructure — and millions of jobs .
More important , it will create millions more .
It literally could pull us out of this recession .
In contrast , yesterday General Motors presented its restructuring proposal to Congress .
They promised if Congress gave them $ 18 billion now , they would , in turn , eliminate around 20,000 jobs .
You read that right .
We give them billions so they can throw more Americans out of work .
That 's been their Big Idea for the last 30 years — lay off thousands in order to protect profits .
But no one ever stopped to ask this question :
If you throw everyone out of work , who 's going to have the money to go out and buy a car ?
These idiots do n't deserve a dime .
Fire all of them , and take over the industry for the good of the workers , the country , and the planet .
What 's good for General Motors is good for the country .
Once the country is calling the shots .

CHICAGO , Dec 9 ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp agreed on Tuesday to provide what it called a limited amount of additional loans to a window manufacturer that has been occupied by laid - off workers for five days .
Bank of America said the loans would “ help fund a comprehensive resolution of Employee Claims ” at Republic Windows & Doors .
Republic shut its doors on Friday on three days notice and has been the site of a worker sit -in since .
The amount of the loans was not specified .
The bank , which has received $ 15 billion in federal bailout money , has been singled out by labor leaders and politicians for yanking its line of credit to Republic and leaving the workers out in the cold ahead of Christmas .
Workers demanded to be paid for what they say is a legally mandated 60 - day notice period before a plant closing and for unused vacation time .
The parties met for several hours on Monday and Tuesday to try to resolve the issue .

FHM even named her their " international honey . "
Can you blame them ?
Gamba has also made television appearances and taken part in music videos .

Despite those significant changes , the report still relies on inflated estimates of reserves from OPEC countries , overplays the contribution of reserves growth due to technology and predicts the reversal of a decades long trend of declining oil discoveries .
These are the real factors that will send oil production into decline , but at least now we have some numbers we can discuss and analyze instead of a decade of blind faith in oil market economics .
True to their word , the 2008 World Energy Outlook represents a significant development by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) in the philosophy and methodology of their oil supply forecasts .
The report attempts a bottom - up model of the world 's oil production potential and even revises down estimates previously taken at face value from the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
The tone of the report has also changed dramatically , with an urgent call for investment in additional oil projects to avoid production shortfalls by 2015 .
This article is part of a series of posts on the IEA 2008 World Energy Outlook , which includes other articles on issues more closely related to production .
In this post , I review the IEA figures for conventional oil reserves and future resources , including natural gas liquids ( NGLs ) .
The chart above shows that the IEA 's estimate for these resources amounts to 3,577 billion barrels , or approximately 3.6 trillion barrels .
I will show that a better estimate is 2.5 trillion barrels , a reduction of 1.1 trillion barrels .
Resources relate to the total amount of oil and NGLs that can ultimately be produced , rather than the amount of production in any given year .
However , even with 3.6 trillion barrels of resources , the IEA just barely manage to show oil production increasing to 2030 at an anemic annual rate of two hundred thousand barrels per day .
According to the IEA :
Worldwide production of conventional crude oil alone increases only modestly from 70.2 mb/d to 75.2 mb/d over the period .
( Page 250 )
With 1.1 trillion barrels less resources , the result is likely to be much lower .
The first item on my initial slide ( repeated below ) is cumulative production - the amount of oil extracted to date .
This is the only figure about which there is little to dispute .
In the remainder of this article I will reassess the IEA 's other figures for ( 1 ) Remaining Reserves , ( 2 ) Reserves Growth and ( 3 ) Undiscovered Resources .
Remaining Reserves
Companies producing oil make estimates of the amount of their ' proven ' reserves remaining .
These are generally published in financial statements , and are a matter of public record .
Despite the vagaries of financial reporting standards for oil reserves ( which the IEA report comments extensively on ) , the estimates for reserves in Non-OPEC countries can be taken as a reasonable estimate .
OPEC reserves on the other hand are the " toxic low - doc mortgage backed investments " of the oil world .
At issue particularly are the large fraction of world reserves reported by National Oil Companies in the Middle East .
The reserves of these companies are not audited , which the IEA recognises in the following statement :
Auditing reserves and publishing the results are far from universal practice .
Many oil companies , including international oil companies , use external auditors and publish the results , but most National Oil Companies do not .
( Page 199 )
OPEC Reserves ( Paper Barrels )
There are strong reasons to believe that OPEC reserves , particularly for Middle Eastern countries , are considerably overstated .
Stated Oil Reserves in Selected OPEC Countries
Source : OPEC 2006 Annual Report
When Kuwait raised its stated reserves in 1984 from 67 to 92.7 billion barrels , it had the effect of increasing their production quota at a time of low oil prices , thereby increasing their revenue at the expense of other OPEC members .
Not surprisingly , the next year Venezuela doubled its reserve estimate .
The United Arab Emirates , who previously had 33 billion barrels of oil , must have found an additional 60 billion barrels in a cellar cupboard which they subsequently put on the books in 1986 .
Saddam Hussein in Iraq kept things simple with a revision to a clean 100.0 billion barrels in 1987 .
He then , like many of the others , reported exactly the same figure for a decade .
Only by the late 1990's , when that reporting game became patently absurd , did they start reporting minor increases to make the figures look more sensible .
This is nonsense and the IEA even recognises it as such :
According to BP , which compiles published official figures , proven reserves worldwide have almost doubled since 1980 ( Figure 9.3 ) .
Most of the changes result from increases in official figures from OPEC countries , mainly in the Middle East , as a result of large upward revisions in 1986 - 1987 .
They were driven by negotiations at that time over production quotas and have little to do with the discovery of new reserves or physical appraisal works on discovered fields .
The official reserves of OPEC countries have hardly changed since then , despite ongoing production .
( Page 202 )
That is the first and last time the IEA report refers to this fundamental problem with stated OPEC oil reserves .
While $ 100,000 will buy you access to industry databases with information about oil fields throughout the rest of the world , the information relating to OPEC countries is not much better than guesswork .
This year , however , the IEA paid to access such a commercial database from IHS : " a leading global source of critical information and insight , dedicated to providing the most complete and trusted data and expertise " .
The IHS data for OECD countries is perhaps the best available , but because accurate reserve estimates for OPEC countries are closely guarded state secrets , their figures relating to OPEC oil fields are less accurate .
Why have we become addicted to oil without demanding adequate disclosure from the countries holding the largest share of such an important commodity for the world economy ?
While the reported figures are poor , we do have other sources of information about OPEC oil resources .
International oil companies , including those based in the United States , operated in the Middle East for several decades before ownership was transferred to state - run National Oil Companies .
International Oil Companies in the Middle East
Oil exploration in the Middle East goes back a century or more and activity accelerated after the Second World War .
Western oil companies were heavily involved in oil exploration and production for more than two decades , enough time to build up a considerable knowledge of the giant fields and remaining exploration potential , prior to nationalisation in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
Since then , a myth has developed ( in their own interest ) that if only a western oil company could get back in there and drill more exploration wells then more oil would be found .
The reality is that these are mature oil provinces that are quite thoroughly explored .
The reason the industry made early discoveries there is because the majority of oil in the Middle East lies at shallow depths in large and easily identified structures .
Future discoveries will be limited to smaller structures , or drilling into deeper formations which are more likely to contain gas than oil .
Exploration statistics in Saudi Arabia tell the story another way .
80 % of Saudi Arabia 's oil resources were discovered by the first 20 new field wildcat exploration wells between 1935 and 1965 .
The last 20 wildcat exploration wells have only found 1 % of the resources ( Laherrere , 2006 ) .
The reason exploration drilling has reduced is because there is not much more to be found : drilling wells cannot find oil that is not there .
One man who has first hand experience of reserves accounting in the Middle East is Jeremy Gilbert , who provided this quote :
Jeremy Gilbert , former BP Chief Petroleum Engineer
There were people from the International Oil Companies still working with virtually all the OPEC country National Oil Companies in the late 1970s .
From talking to a cross-section of them we can be sure that the numbers quoted for OPEC reserves in the early 1980s ( before the revisions ) were reasonable .
I was more or less responsible for the Iran reserves compilation in 1977 and 1978 and I worked in Abu Dhabi and Kuwait in the early 1970s : I am quite confident that the numbers shown for these countries in the early 1980s are good ; they are possibly a little conservative , because there was some reluctance by the western International Oil Companies to make big capital investments in improved secondary / tertiary recovery which might have led to slightly higher numbers , say 5 % more at most .
Since we know from service company and other sources that there were no multi-billion barrel discoveries in these countries in the mid 1980s there can be no technical basis on which reserve estimates could have later increased as reported by the individual National Oil Companies .
It is probable that the archives of BP , Shell , ExxonMobil etc. , contain reports from the period which would confirm all of this .
These companies provided technical - expert teams which regularly reviewed field performance data and reserves estimates with the technical staff of the operating companies during the 1970s .
Jeremy Gilbert 's quote indicates that the reserves stated in 1983 were relatively accurate , but that there is little justification for the big increases countries reported in the following years .
The International Oil Companies ( such as BP , ExxonMobil , Shell and Total ) are running out of good options elsewhere , so it is natural that they now want a piece of the action where most of the remaining resources are .
This is the reason for their public agenda pushing for greater access to Middle Eastern resources .
The problem is that their argument that the Middle East needs them is wearing thin .
The International Oil Companies sold many of their specialist capabilities to oilfield service companies ( such as Schlumberger , Halliburton and Transocean ) long ago .
Those service companies now operate in the Middle East just as they do anywhere else , as subcontractors to the National Oil Companies .
Despite their desperation , the International Oil Companies have very little to offer , and the IEA has accepted as much :
Higher oil prices and a growing conviction among political leaders that national companies serve the nation 's interests better than private and foreign oil companies have boosted the confidence and aspirations of national companies , some of them rivaling the international companies in technical capability and efficiency .
( Page 333 ) National companies are becoming more technically proficient and better able to handle the challenging new developments with the help of the oilfield - service companies .
( Page 334 )
Saudi Aramco in particular could lay claim to being one of the most capable oil companies , and it is successfully executing some of the largest ever oil field megaprojects .
That said , its disclosure standards do leave a lot to be desired .
Kuwait Comes Clean , UAE Downgraded
Kuwait oil reserves only half official estimate
19th January , 2006 " Petroleum Intelligence Weekly learns from sources that Kuwait 's actual oil reserves , which are officially stated at around 99 billion barrels , or close to 10 percent of the global total , are a good deal lower , according to internal Kuwaiti records , " the weekly PIW reported on Friday .
It said that according to data circulated in Kuwait Oil Co ( KOC ) , the upstream arm of state Kuwait Petroleum Corp , Kuwait 's remaining proven and non-proven oil reserves are about 48 billion barrels .
In a previous IEA report , World Energy Trends 2005 – Middle East and North Africa , the IEA have themselves downgraded reserves estimates for Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates .
Kuwait was estimated to have ' proven plus probable ' reserves of 54.9 billion barrels ( slightly higher but similar to the leaked figure above ) while the UAE was estimated to have 55.1 billion barrels .
These two revisions alone represent a reserves downgrade of almost 90 billion barrels .
Yet there is no evidence that the IEA has used these lower figures in their 2008 World Energy Outlook .
They have instead reverted to their reliance on OPEC and IHS .
Assessment of Saudi Arabia's Giant Oil Fields
While Saudi Aramco and the NOCs of other OPEC countries publish many technical papers , they consistently remove references to particular fields or locations to deter others from drawing conclusions about their overall reserves .
However in May 2007 , after months of painstaking forensic work piecing together charts and information from dozens of technical papers , Stuart Staniford and Euan Mearns prepared separate assessments of Ghawar , the world 's largest oil field in Saudi Arabia .
Subsequently , JoulesBurn used satellite observations of drilling rig locations around Ghawar to provide independent confirmation for the findings and predictions from Stuart and Euan 's investigations .
( JoulesBurn has also already provided his more detailed critique of the IEA 2008 Saudi Arabia analysis ) .
Taken together , these two pieces of research above constitute an unprecedented challenge to the integrity of the IHS oil database , the blind acceptance of stated OPEC reserves by the IEA and the idea that the Middle East can easily meet the expanding future oil production needs of the world .
For comparison , the IEA published their estimate of Ghawar 's size , based presumably on the IHS database :
All of the 20 largest producing fields are super - giants , of which Ghawar , with 140 billion barrels of initial reserves , is by far the largest .
( Page 226 )
The conclusion of Stuart Staniford 's analysis was that the Ghawar field had initial reserves of 96 billion barrels ( +/- 15 billion ) .
In this one giant field alone , we therefore have 40 billion barrels of overstated oil reserves .
The IHS data for OPEC fields and the IEA 's reliance on it must be called into question .
Counting the Paper Barrels
The " quota wars " in 1984 - 1988 led to total upward revisions of 284 billion barrels .
OPEC oil production since 1985 has been more than 170 billion barrels but this has not been subtracted from reserves estimates either .
Adding these two figures gives a total of 454 billion barrels , although some allowance must be made for the real discoveries and field development work that has been made since then .
In a May 2008 article Oil Reserves : Where Ghawar goes , the rest of OPEC follows , I combined Stuart 's work on Ghawar , Euan 's additional analysis of the Abqaiq field , a 1979 report to a US Senate Subcommittee on " The Future of Saudi Arabian Oil Production " and the IEA revisions for Kuwait and UAE ( above ) to estimate that OPEC oil reserves in total are overstated by some 340 billion barrels .
With such secrecy around the real figures comes enormous uncertainty .
However , a conclusion that OPEC oil reserves are overstated by between 250 and 450 billion barrels is robust .
Reserves Growth
The second figure that needs revision is that for " Reserves Growth " , which the IEA sees as playing a very important role :
A growing share of the additions to reserves has been coming from revisions to estimates of the reserves in fields already in production or undergoing appraisal ( reserves growth ) rather than from new discoveries .
( Page 203 )
The IEA also discusses the different factors that can lead to reserves growth :
Geological factors :
The delineation of additional reserves through new seismic acquisition , appraisal drilling or the identification ( using well - bore measurements ) , of reservoirs that had been previously bypassed .
Technological factors :
An increase in the share of oil in place that can be recovered through the application of new technologies , such as increased reservoir contact , improved secondary recovery and enhanced oil recovery .
Definitional factors : Economic , logistical and political / regulatory / fiscal changes in the operating environment .
( Page 210 )
Geological factors can be summarised as increasing the estimate of the Oil Initially In Place in the reservoir ( OIIP ) or the recovery factor ( ie. how much of the oil in place can be produced ) .
At the time of discovery of a new oil field , there is large uncertainty in these estimates , but this reduces after a field has been producing for several years .
The technologies that most significantly increase recovery of oil from existing fields , particular secondary and tertiary recovery , have been standard industry practice for many decades .
While there are further developments to be made , the largest and easiest gains have already been achieved .
External factors such as high oil prices have not been as constant , but are the least significant of the three .
An ageing workforce and other capacity constraints also limit the speed with which other measures can be implemented .
The nature of the game is that these gains will be extracted slowly over a long period of time .
Reserves Growth Case Studies
There are a handful of celebrity oil fields that show a remarkable increase in reserves as a result of additional development work .
The World Energy Outlook featured one of these , the Weyburn field in Canada :
But cherry - picking one example is not very helpful .
The chart below shows the reserves estimates for a number of UK North Sea fields , demonstrating just how volatile and uncertain reserves estimates are .
Source : Harper ( BP ) , ASPO Berlin , May 2004
There is a great deal of uncertainty with early estimates of an oil field 's reserves but an oil company 's best estimate of ' proven plus probable ' reserves is just as likely to go down as up .
Increases in reserves due to application of new technology or changing economic assumptions are small compared to the total variability .
From the above chart , it would be easy to pick one field with a dramatic story of reserves growth , but the average is one of only slow growth over an extended period of time .
So it is inappropriate for the IEA to talk about the returns due to Enhanced Recovery using CO2 in the Weyburn field as though that same experience could be repeated everywhere .
Generally such techniques are only economic where standard production practices are not effective due to poor characteristics of the particular oil field .
In How Technology Increases Oil Production , I analysed a more representative story about TOTAL 's giant Handil field in Indonesia :
What is simply described as " Mature Field Revitalization " comprises many years of technically challenging study and modeling followed by intensive application in the field .
For the engineers and geologists involved this was no doubt rewarding work .
Yet for a substantial investment of time , money and effort in this giant field , we gain just 10,000 barrels per day of oil production towards the end of its field life .
Nevertheless , this was the most significant of several case studies featured in the Society of Petroleum Engineers ' January 2008 Journal of Production Technology .
While there will be isolated fields that perform better , there will be many more where such activity is economically marginal at best .
Why then , has the ' reserves growth ' argument become so prominent ?
A Happy Marriage : USGS and IHS
In their 2000 study , the United States Geological Survey estimated 730 billion barrels of reserve growth over the thirty year period from 1995 - 2025 .
This describes an annual reserves increase of 2.5 % which is far greater than oil company 's observations of their own fields .
The primary reason for this is that the USGS looked at conservative ' proven ' reserves rather than the best estimate of ' proven plus probable ' reserves .
The story , however , seems to get more interesting .
Since 1995 , IHS has been revising up their field estimates , especially for giant fields in the Middle East .
Former TOTAL petroleum engineer Jean Laherrere has roundly criticised this as " political pollution of technical databases " .
It has been suggested that these revisions help bring the IHS into favour with the OPEC National Oil Companies , perhaps earning them important new clients .
Curiously , since these type of revisions have been applied over the last decade to the giant OPEC fields ( which contain a large fraction of total world oil reserves ) , it also means that when the USGS go back and look at the IHS data almost a decade after their original study , they find evidence that reserves are growing in line with their predictions - but the data that they are using to reach this conclusion may be almost completely arbitrary !
Taking just one example of these revisions , the recovery factor for Ghawar in 2001 in the IHS database was a reasonable 47 % .
By 2004 the recovery factor was increased to 60 % and in 2006 increased again to an incredible 70 % ( Laherrere , Groningen , 2006 ) .
This compares to a recovery factor of around 55 % determined by Stuart and Euan in their forensic study of Ghawar .
A 70 % recovery factor is unlikely even in the high quality northern sections of this field , but is wildly implausible across the field as a whole .
Re-assessing Reserves Growth
In Shedding Light on the Question of Reserves Growth , I suggested an alternative model for estimating the potential for reserves growth .
A summary was also published in the June 2007 Journal of Petroluem Technology in response to an earlier opinion piece from CERA 's Peter Jackson .
This model recognises that as fields get older the maturity of their reserves estimate improves and the scope for future reserves growth reduces .
This reflects , amongst other factors , the field progressing through different development stages ( see the original article for more detail ) .
The figures in this table are rough estimates at best , but they correctly describe the scale of what reserves growth could achieve .
Since 90 % of production now comes from fields more than 20 years old , our resource base is very mature .
While oil field reserves may have ' grown ' 10 - 20 per cent since the 1980s , we should not expect the next 20 years to deliver the same gain .
Discovery of new fields has tapered off to low levels and the easy pickings for increased recovery have already been had .
Reserves Growth - Double Trouble
There is also a compound failure in the IEA approach to reserves growth .
They are taking an optimistic assessment of how much reserves grow over time , and multiplying it by a clearly inflated figure for OPEC reserves .
A moderate reduction in the assessment of reserves growth , multiplied by a figure corrected for OPEC overstatements yields a significantly lower total estimate for reserves growth .
The IEA are to be congratulated for a lower assessment of reserves growth this year ( 402 billion barrels total ) than previous estimates from the USGS ( 730 billion barrels over 30 years ) .
However , their arguments and the trends in IHS data are misleading and a figure that is lower still , around 200 - 250 billion barrels , is far more likely .
Undiscovered Resources
The third and final figure that needs revision is ' Undiscovered Resources ' .
The World Energy Outlook provides this graphical summary illustrating that oil discoveries have been declining since the 1960s and that production has exceeded discoveries since the 1980s :
The volume discovered has fallen well below the volume produced in the last two decades , though the volume of oil found on average since 2000 has exceeded the rate in the 1990's thanks to increased exploration activity ( with higher oil prices ) and improvements in technology .
( Page 197 )
The following chart tells a similar story but on an annual basis and over a longer time scale .
( Discovery Source Data : Longwell ( ExxonMobil ) , World Energy , Vol 5 No3 2002 )
The yellow bars are an extrapolation of the oil discovery trend , which sum to an estimate of around 200 billion barrels remaining to be discovered .
In contrast , the red box shows the average amount estimated to be discovered by the USGS each year between 1995 and 2025 ( totaling 939 billion barrels ) .
More than ten years into their forecast period it is clearly implausible that their forecast could be met ( as Rembrandt has also discussed ) .
The IEA take a figure of 805 billion barrels as the ultimate resource yet - to - be - discovered .
That still implies a radical departure from the discovery trend and appears hopelessly optimistic .
It could be argued that exploration in Iraq , extreme Arctic areas and possibly even deepwater offshore Brazil have been constrained by external factors and that discoveries in those regions could therefore represent a break from the prior discovery trend .
There is only a limited basis for this claim though .
While the Arctic has some petroleum potential , the alternating presence of ice caps over geological timescales causes fractures in the underlying layers , making it unlikely that large petroleum accumulations have survived intact .
Additionally , the Arctic is more likely to be gas rather than oil - prone .
Recent Brazilian finds provide extreme technical challenges and it is not yet clear how much will ever be economic to recover .
Discovery potential in Iraq is also highly speculative , although no doubt significant compared to limited potential elsewhere .
In short , these provinces could increase future discovery above 200 billion barrels , but more than 300 billion barrels is highly unlikely .
World Oil Resources
Having reassessed the three categories of resources , it is now possible to present a more robust picture of the resources underpinning future production :
Rather than having produced 32 % of a 3,577 billion barrel resource , we have more likely consumed 45 % of a 2,500 billion barrel resource .
The estimate is only slightly higher than recent publications by Laherrere & Wingert and Campbell , who estimate global ultimately recoverable conventional oil resources at 2,250 and 2,270 billion barrels respectively .
Note that of the remaining 1,370 billion barrels in the Table above , some 200 billion barrels are Natural Gas Liquids which have only two - thirds the energy content of crude oil and cannot be used by much of the existing transport fleet and infrastructure .
In total , our remaining conventional oil and NGL resources are more likely only 55 % of what the IEA concludes in its 2008 outlook .
Conventional oil and NGL production in 2030 is therefore likely to be 50 - 60 million barrels per day , compared to the current level of just over 80 md/d .
Even optimistic assessments of the potential for unconventional oil cannot close that gap .
Oil production will therefore not be greater than 100 mb/d in 2030 as forecast by the IEA , even though that is a reduction of 10 mb/d from their last World Energy Outlook .
Summary
Previously the IEA has openly assumed that the growing gap between future demand and their forecast for non-OPEC production would be met by OPEC , with no quantification of whether OPEC resources were available to match that ambitious assumption .
That the IEA has now attempted a resource based estimate for both non-OPEC and OPEC regions is a vital albeit obvious and overdue step forward .
In another positive move , the IEA has also seen fit to independently revise down the USGS estimates for reserves growth and undiscovered resources .
The most obvious and fundamental flaw in the IEA report is that OPEC reserves have again been taken at face value .
The laws of physics do not stop at the Middle East borders and there is not some mythical abundance of oil in OPEC countries .
They do have the largest share of remaining resources but they cannot meet our expanding desire for oil forever .
Despite recognising the OPEC reserves issue , the IEA has avoided confronting it .
The poor quality of data for these countries has consequential impacts on the assessment of reserves growth and real discovery trends .
We cannot have a robust official forecast of future oil supply until we get transparent and audited information concerning oil reserves in OPEC countries .
The IEA has warned that massive levels of investment are required to bring oil resources to market in a timely manner , but the reality is that oil resources are insufficient to meet these forecasts regardless of investment .
Oil production will be heading down hill well before 2030 , constrained by a fundamental lack of oil resources and not simply a lack of investment .

Appropriately enough , the Schlitz brand is owned by returning in limited quantities to its ancestral haunts along Lake Michigan back in June .
In Milwaukee , the anticipated news created waiting lists at the handful of liquor stores that carried it .
Now , within the next few weeks Frank Distributing of Middleton is planning to introduce the beer back to Madison .
Schlitz is a Pilsner , a beer in the lager family , and a style known for its clear pale to deep golden color and crisp hoppiness .
American renditions of the Pilsner are grainier than that of traditional German versions , and feature dryer flavor profiles .
It is the kind of beer that those who like the style can appreciate for its light body , effervesce and clean taste .
The famous brown bottles , meanwhile , were first used by the brewery in 1912 , and were touted as an innovation to keep light from spoiling the beer .
They 're now ubiquitous in beer cases of all makes today for the same reason .
This retro version of Schlitz pours golden and bubbly , and has a soft texture with a mild bitter hoppiness .
Overall , it is what mass produced lagers are well - known for , light - bodied and clean - tasting .
It tastes very much like the old Schlitz in the can , except the texture of this retro Schlitz seems softer and more rounded , with an earthiness that grows over the course of a bottle .
The recipe has its origins more than a century - and - a - half ago , when August Krug started a brewery in Milwaukee back in 1849 , hiring one Joseph Schlitz as a bookkeeper in 1850 .
It subsequently grew to become the world 's biggest beer through the early 1900s , with Schlitz emerging alongside Miller , Budweiser , and Pabst as the giants of American breweries .
Competition drove them to distinguish each from one another through advertising and holding down production costs .
Schlitz ultimately tinkered a little too much with its recipe and brewing process , and by the early ' 70s beer drinkers did n't like the result .
Dropping consumer confidence in the beer combined with labor disagreements resulted in the brewery halting its Milwaukee - based production in 1981 .
The Schlitz brand was sold to Stroh 's of Detroit in 1982 , and was purchased by Pabst in 1999 .
Through these transitions , Schlitz continued to be available in cans , but dwindled in availability and reputation along with the broader Milwaukee brewing industry .
John Sonnemann of Waukesha worked for Schlitz beginning in 1964 , and remained there until the Milwaukee operations ceased seventeen years later .
He lead tasting panels for the brewery and remembers the flavors and aromas very well .
" In the 1960s you could expect more flavor , especially bitterness in Schlitz , " he says , " its flavor made it a good beer . "
Sonnemann contrasts his recollections of Schlitz 's original recipe as big breweries became more conscious about the costs of raw products .
" As they grew in size , they trimmed their uses of malt and hops to save costs , " he explains .
The former brewery taster admitted he has n't tried the retro Schlitz yet , but says he is looking forward to getting over a recent illness so he can .
" I 've tasted a lot of that beer , and I 'd like to see if they can really make it like I remember it , " he notes .
" I have my doubts they can really make it taste like it used to . "
On a recent drive through Chicago , cases of classic retro Schlitz could be found at Binny 's Beverage Depot priced at $ 6.49 / six pack and $ 24 / case .
There seemed to be a bit of déjà vu in seeing cases of Schlitz stacked up next to Point Special and sitting in the cooler side - by - side with bottles of Miller and Bud .
Officials at Frank Distributing say they been receiving several calls a week from those wanting to know where they can find it in Madison .
But the local distributor is tight lipped about exactly when and where it will be sold , with managers merely confirming a shipment of about 2,000 cases should be available around town as early as next week .
Located in a refabbed 1950s service station , this hip restaurant serves globally inspired cuisine with a focus on veggies and sustainable meats .

The War on Drugs is undermining America ’s War on Terror by :
creating an adversarial relationship with a large portion of the country ;
calling into question the legitimacy of the rule of law and law enforcement ;
competing for law enforcement resources ; and
revealing the measures we take to track money being laundered and to stop smuggling .
The threat of terrorism is real , if often exaggerated for political purposes ; and the consequences of a low probability , high impact attack could be catastrophic .
If terrorism is our most immediate national security threat , then we must rearrange our priorities and end the failing Drug War .
The prosecution of Tommy Chong ( half of the perpetually baked comedy duo Cheech and Chong ) illustrates some of these points .
The state of Pennsylvania prohibits the shipping of drug paraphernalia – such as bongs – into it ’s state .
In 2003 , a man from Beaver Falls , PA began calling a store in California run by the family of Tommy Chong asking them to ship him a large order of bongs and assorted other glassware .
A manager at the store claimed that man called at least 20 times – and each time a representative of the store told him they could not ship to his state , citing the Pennsylvania law .
This very determined man traveled to California to order the items – but he was not determined enough to stay around until his order was packed up .
He returned to Pennsylvania .
The store still refused to ship him the items – but after a few weeks , they gave in to his repeated demands .
That was the excuse a SWAT team needed to raid the store and arrest Tommy Chong .
The entire operation was set up by a U. S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania , Mary Beth Buchanan .
The net cost to the taxpayer to put Tommy Chong in jail for 9 months ( Chong was convinced to take the fall although he did n’t run the business and had nothing to do with this incident ) was $ 12 million .
Tommy Chong , reflecting on the lessons of his experience pointed to “ the absurdity of the War on Drugs when we have a much more pressing – and wholly unrelated – war on terrorism to worry about . ”
I only disagree with the sage Tommy Chong in that the two wars are wholly unrelated .
They are related intimately – and the war against Tommy Chong is making the war against Al Qaeda harder .
The most profound way the War on Drugs is undermining the War on Terror is how it calls into question the legitimacy of the rule of law and of law enforcement .
Tommy Chong ’s case is not atypical in how disproportionate the resources used to take him down were to his threat to society – from the millions of dollars spent to the SWAT team to the sting operation – you would expect him to be some kind of violent drug lord .
Chong ’s case is exceptional only due to his celebrity .
The number of hours dedicated to fighting the Drug War against American citizens is incalculable .
Each arrest for possession , for possession with intent to distribute , or any other of a long list minor offenses involves the time and attention of police officers , as well as judges and attorneys .
Yet with all this effort , this War on Drugs has been fruitless .
As Ben Wallace - Wells subtitled his summary of the War on Drugs : “ After Thirty - Five Years and $ 500 Billion , Drugs Are as Cheap and Plentiful as Ever . ”
Excessive force is often used in the Drug War – and not just against isolated individuals .
The libertarian CATO Institute has documented the enormous number of paramilitary raids – mainly involved in the War on Drugs .
They cite an estimate of 40,000 paramilitary raids a year – including many which kill innocent bystanders or are raids on the wrong address .
In an example from just a few months ago , police raided the home of the mayor of a small suburb outside of Baltimore and shot his dogs in search of marijuana .
The mayor and his family were innocent , as were the dogs .
One of the mayors neighbors said to him after the police raid : “ If the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you , how can I trust them ? ”
At the same time , the Drug War has alienated a large segment of its population from its law enforcement and national security agencies .
At times – especially as in the case of Tommy Chong – it seems to have become a surrogate for a culture war .
Largely as a result of the War on Drugs , America has the largest incarceration rate of any nation in the world .
Yet most offenders of drug laws are never imprisoned – as it is estimated that nearly 7 % of Americans use illegal drugs every month .
Among the Americans to cross into enemy lines in the War on Drugs include our last , current , and future presidents .
The War on Drugs has created an adversarial relationship between the government and a large portion of Americans .
The failures of the Drug War have n’t yet affected the War on Terror because it has largely been seen as something “ different , ” something which unites all Americans , which transcends boundaries .
Mobsters , drug dealers , smugglers , and even governors of Illinois may be threats to the rule of law and targets of law enforcement , but they , with law enforcement , see terrorists as enemies of civilization .
The Sopranos illustrated this with a storyline in which a mobster is asked by the FBI to keep a lookout for suspicious activity – and he is eager to .
But the War on Drugs keeps threatening to undermine this essential distinction , as law enforcement uses powers designated to it in order to fight terrorism for other ends .
The War on Drugs also competes with the War on Terror for government resources and attention .
This refers not only to the degree to which the FBI , Customs , and local police forces must split their attention between the two Wars – thus shortchanging both , but also to the more formal war in Afghanistan .
Our anti-drug policy is driving the poor farmers of Afghanistan to seek the protection of the Taliban according to President Hamid Karzai .
At the same time , even as additional resources have been allocated at the federal level to combat terrorism , local police forces must now split their attention – and their efforts in the Drug War often undermine the trust they need to prevent a potential terrorist attack .
More insidious though is how the intersection of the War on Drugs and the incentives of drug trafficking create an infrastructure that can be used for terrorism as a Congressional report from 2004 explained .
The enormous profits involved in drug trafficking have incentivized an industry dedicated to undermining our national security infrastructure – it has created experts in smuggling to get contraband through or around Customs and into America ; it supports an industry of money laundering and of illegal weapons and false identifications .
All of these are useful and often essential to a terrorist operation – and yet none of these could be adequately financed by terrorism alone .
The efforts of the War on Drugs reveal weaknesses in our national security to drug dealers and terrorists alike .
One of the authors of a study of America ’s vulnerability to nuclear terrorism joked the best way to smuggle nuclear material into America would be in a package of cocaine .
If America were to focus our national security efforts – including efforts to track suspicious money and to prevent smuggling on terrorist - related targets , less would be known of our capabilities .
The War on Drugs has failed in its objectives .
It affects Americans unequally and unfairly .
And it is making us less safe .
There is an international consensus on the dangers of heroin and cocaine trafficking – and we should continue to combat them .
But we stop fighting a “ War on Drugs ” that is undermining the War on Terror .
We must rationalize the drug laws – by equalizing the penalties across similar classes of drugs and by legalizing those drugs health experts agree are less dangerous and addictive while continuing to make efforts to reduce the demand for and smuggling of the rest .
We must end the “ War on Drugs ” that is targeting a significant percentage of American citizens and helping to destabilize countries around the world .
We must stop blurring the lines between our efforts to stop drug trafficking and the War on Terror .
The best defense against terrorism is a people who trust law enforcement , respect the rule of law , and are knowledgeable about threats .
The War on Drugs is squandering this resource .
Which is why we must end it .

Class surprises lesbian teacher on wedding day CAMPAIGN 2008 / Proposition 8
A group of San Francisco first - graders took an unusual field trip to City Hall on Friday to toss rose petals on their just - married lesbian teacher - putting the public school children at the center of a fierce election battle over the fate of same - sex marriage .
The 18 Creative Arts Charter School students took a Muni bus and walked a block at noon to toss rose petals and blow bubbles on their just - married teacher Erin Carder and her wife Kerri McCoy , giggling and squealing as they mobbed their teacher with hugs .
Mayor Gavin Newsom , a friend of a friend , officiated .
A parent came up with the idea for the field trip - a surprise for the teacher on her wedding day .
" She 's such a dedicated teacher , " said the school 's interim director Liz Jaroflow .
But there was a question of justifying the field trip academically .
Jaroflow decided she could .
" It really is what we call a teachable moment , " Jaroflow said , noting the historic significance of same - sex marriage and related civil rights issues .
" I think I 'm well within the parameters . "
Erin Carder 's ( left ) 1st grade class from Creative Arts Charter School , a public elementary school , throws rose petals on the steps of City Hall after she and her partner , Kerri McCoy , were married on Friday Oct. 10 , 2008 in San Francisco , Calif . less Erin Carder 's ( left ) 1st grade class from Creative Arts Charter School , a public elementary school , throws rose petals on the steps of City Hall after she and her partner , Kerri McCoy , were married on Friday ... more Photo : Mike Kepka , The Chronicle Photo : Mike Kepka , The Chronicle Image 1 of / 9 Caption Close Class surprises lesbian teacher on wedding day 1 / 9 Back to Gallery
Nonetheless , the excursion offers Proposition 8 proponents fresh ammunition for their efforts to outlaw gay marriage in California , offering a real - life incident that echoes their recent television and radio ads .
" It 's just utterly unreasonable that a public school field trip would be to a same - sex wedding , " said Chip White , press secretary for the Yes on 8 campaign .
" This is overt indoctrination of children who are too young to have an understanding of its purpose . "
The trip illustrates the message promoted by the campaign in recent days , namely that unless Prop. 8 passes on Nov. 4 , children will learn about same - sex marriage in school .
" It shows that not only can it happen , but it has already happened , " White said .
California Education
Code permits school districts to offer comprehensive sex education , but if they do , they have to " teach respect for marriage and committed relationships . "
Parents can excuse their child from all or part of the instruction .
On Friday , McCoy and Carder , both in white , held hands on Newsom 's office balcony overlooking the rotunda and recited their vows .
" With this ring , I thee wed ! "
Carder said , shouting the last word for emphasis .
After traditional photos , the two walked out City Hall 's main doors where the students were lined up down the steps with bags of pink rose petals and bottles of bubbles hanging from their necks .
McCoy , a conferences services coordinator , was in on the surprise and beamed as the children swarmed around Carder .
The two said they have participated in the campaign against Proposition 8 and planned to travel around San Francisco on Friday afternoon in a motorized trolley car with " Just Married " and " Vote No on 8 " banners .
The two met on a dance floor two years ago .
" This is one girl I can honestly say deserves happiness , and it came in the form of Kerri , " said Carder 's friend Dani Starelli .
Creative Arts administrators and parents acknowledged that the field trip might be controversial , but they did n't see the big deal .
Same - sex marriage is legal , they noted .
" How many days in school are they going to remember ? " asked parent Mark Lipsett .
" This is a day they 'll definitely remember . "
Carder 's students said they were happy to see their new teacher married .
" She 's a really nice teacher .
She 's the best , " said 6 - year - old Chava Novogrodsky - Godt , wearing a " No on 8 " button on her shirt .
" I want her to have a good wedding . "
Chava 's mothers said they are getting married in two weeks .
The students ' parents are planning to make a video with the children describing what marriage is to them .
Marriage , 6 - year - old Nolan Alexander said Friday , is " people falling in love . "
It means , he added , " You stay with someone the rest of your life . "
As is the case with all field trips , parents had to give their permission and could choose to opt out of the trip .
Two families did .
Those children spent the duration of the 90 - minute field trip back at school with another first - grade class , the interim director said .
" As far as I 'm concerned , it 's not controversial for me , " Jaroflow said .
" It 's certainly an issue I would be willing to put my job on the line for . "

Paying for sex with prostitutes who are controlled by pimps is set to become a criminal offence in England and Wales , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said .
Anyone who knowingly pays illegally trafficked women for sex could face rape charges , while kerb crawlers could face prosecution for a first offence .
There will also be more " naming and shaming " of kerb crawlers and new police powers to close brothels .
Buying or selling sex is legal but soliciting and pimping are not .
The changes bring the law in England and Wales more into line with Scotland , where anyone looking to pick up a prostitute faces a fine of up to £ 1,000 .
Ms Smith said the government had considered banning paying for sex altogether but had ruled this out as there was no public support for such a move .
Instead , she said the government 's efforts would be focused on reducing demand for trafficked women , who were " effectively held as slaves " , and there would be a marketing campaign aimed at men who used prostitutes .
We want to send a clear message to force men to think twice before sex
Home Office
Britain 's prostitution laws Women 's views on the plans She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " My proposal is that men should think twice about paying for sex .
The reason they should do that is actually the majority of women do n't want to be involved in prostitution . "
She added : " Trafficked women do n't have a choice , men do . "
Ms Smith said up to 70 % of prostitutes were controlled by pimps or had been trafficked into the country and the government was working closely with the police on plans to enforce the new laws .
But Nikki Adams , of the English Collective of Prostitutes , said the government had " made up " the number of women being trafficked into the UK and most prostitution was " consenting sex " .
Brothel powers
Under the plan , the Home Office is planning to criminalise paying for sex with a woman " controlled for another person 's gain " .
Those convicted would get a fine and a criminal record .
Pleading ignorance of the circumstances under which a prostitute is working will not count as a defence .
Under the plans , people who pay a prostitute for sex knowing they have been trafficked against their will could be charged with rape .
Ms Smith will promise that kerb - crawling will be punishable the first time a person is caught doing it , rather than just persistent offenders .
The Home Office said police would get powers to close brothels .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The only way to help prostitutes is to legalise the trade and have proper red light districts Neil , Liverpool Critics of the government 's proposals say they will simply drive customers elsewhere , rather than tackling the problem .
Separate proposals will soon be published to place lapdancing clubs under the same licensing arrangements as sex shops , rather than as pubs and bars as at present .
This would allow people living nearby more chance to raise objections .
For the Conservatives , shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said : " The government 's proposals will not protect the most vulnerable victims .
" Rather than creating new laws , the home secretary should focus on enforcing existing laws . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " Help for the victims would be more convincing if the government had n't slashed the budget for human trafficking investigations last week and shut down the leading unit .
" The proposal to close brothels runs the risk of driving already vulnerable women underground and into the hands of pimps and pushers . "
The Sexual Offences
Act 2003 made it illegal to buy sex from anyone aged under 18 and introduced penalties for trafficking adults and children for the purposes of sexual exploitation .
It is not illegal for someone aged over 18 to work as a prostitute in off - street premises but where there is more than one prostitute , the owner of the premises can be prosecuted for keeping a brothel .
Many of the activities associated with street prostitution , such as soliciting and kerb - crawling , are also illegal and it is against the law to advertise sexual services on cards in telephone boxes .
In December last year , Women 's Minister Harriet Harman said paying for sex should be outlawed .

Click to viewSome of the most gorgeous , evocative , and strange science fiction art you 've ever seen comes from the covers of novels written between 1904 - 33 , in SF's " pre-Golden Age . "
Advertisement
Readers , here is the long - awaited second installment in my Pre-Golden Age SF series .
I can't afford first editions of PGA SF novels , but I 've managed to collect images of their dustjackets and " boards " ( as bookbinders call the paper - or cloth - covered stiff cardboard forming a book 's covers ) .
The following 10 SF novels boast the most thrilling and evocative cover ( board or dustjacket ) illustrations and design from 1904 - 33 .
I invite your criticisms ; please note , though , that this is a survey of PGA SF first editions .
Later Edgar Rice Burroughs paperbacks do n't count .

Pre-Golden Age SF's Top Ten Book Covers
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
1. Norman Matson's Doctor Fogg ( New York : The Macmillan Company , 1929 ) .
A shy and retiring Chicago scientist manages to communicate with an advanced alien civilization , whose scientific secrets he refuses to share with Earth 's flawed political powers ; and he accidentally " broadcasts " a gorgeous naked blonde alien with whom he falls in love .
What does the fun dustjacket illustration have to do with it ?
Nothing !
But I love the speeding meteors , which converge cozily at the center of the image ; the void of space absolutely chock - full of stars and planets ; the awkwardness of the gentleman at top right compared with the insouciance of the woman beneath .
I also admire the crimson - orange / navy blue / silver color scheme .
Making the characters ' hair , the men's neckties , the woman 's dress the same color as the slightly italicized title ?
An inspired decision .
NB : The board illustration is also super- cool : it 's a silver planetoid with the words " Doctor Fogg " inside .

2. Karel Čapek's Krakatit ( London : Geoffrey Bles , 1925 ) .
An English translation of the Czech author 's 1924 novel .
A scientist discovers the most powerful explosive ever , but he refuses to share it with ( see above ) Earth 's flawed political powers .
The Art Deco jacket design captures both the excitement and terror of such a discovery .
The stylish typeface says , " Not to worry , the future is awesome ! "
But K. Romney Towndrow 's artwork - an explosion rending the very planet in half - says , " Yes , worry . "
Still , this is a satire , so we 're not encouraged to take things too seriously ; the illustration kinda reminds us of limelights in a canyon of skyscrapers .
It 's as though we were approaching a 1925 Hollywood movie opening , perhaps Marion Fairfax 's The Lost World .
Fun facts :
The book was adapted as a 1947 movie ( d. Otakar Vávra ) and a 1960 opera ( Václav Kašlík ) ; both are supposed to be tremendous .
The 1925 US edition of Krakatit has a more restrained , but still fun , jacket .

3. Edgar Rice Burroughs 's A Princess of Mars ( Chicago : A. C. McClurg & Co. , 1917 ) .
I 'm not impressed with the original book jacket illustrations for Burroughs 's Barsoom series .
Sure , they feature lone heroes confronting hordes of alien warriors , not to mention half - naked damsels menaced by multi-limbed aliens , but ...
Frank Frazetta 's later work on the same titles demonstrates just how tame the original jacket illustrations were .
They make the swords - and - sandals - in - space genre feel middlebrow and uplifting , which is precisely what we hi-lobrows do not enjoy .
Peel away the Barsoomian jackets , though , and you 'll often find more compelling boards underneath .
A Princess of Mars was Burroughs 's first published story - it was serialized in 1912 , under a pseudonym - and everything great about his writing is captured here .
That Arts & Crafts typeface , so pseudo - medieval and chivalrous !
That red planet , so mysterious and alluring !
Stop the world , Edgar , I want to get off .

4. L. Frank Baum's Tik - Tok of Oz ( Reilly & Britton , Chicago , 1914 ) .
Illustrated - like 39 of the 40 canonical Oz editions - by John R. Neill , Baum 's picaresque concerns the efforts of the Shaggy Man ( a proto - hippie who disdains all possessions except his Love Magnet ) to rescue his brother from the Nome King .
Tik - Tok , a copper - bodied clockwork man , first appeared in Ozma of Oz ( 1907 ) , then starred in a 1913 stage musical .
In this book , despite Neill 's sweet , startling dustjacket illustration , Tik - Tok is ( as ever ) an emotionless though fiercely loyal servant .
Exactly like Karel Čapek 's flesh - and - blood " robots . "
Fun fact :
Though often described as the first robot to appear in modern literature ( if you do n't count living - metal creatures , like the golden maidservants who attend Hephaestus in The Iliad , that is ) , Tik - Tok was preceded by Edward S. Ellis 's Steam Man of the Prairies in 1868 .

5. Rudyard Kipling , With the Night Mail : A Story of 2000 A.D. ( New York : Doubleday , Page & Company , 1909 ) .
This SF novella by Kipling - best known for The Jungle Book , Kim , and the Just - So Stories - first appeared in McClure 's magazine in 1905 .
In 2000 , lighter - than - air craft traverse the globe ; the plot follows a mail dirigible on its adventures .
Never Kippled ?
This ai n't the place to start .
However , Kipling did get so excited by his own nerdy vision that the book 's appendices include ersatz instructions to aviators , not to mention advertisements for imaginary dirigible and aeronautical products .
Detailed illustrations and pictorial endpapers make this a gorgeous production , indeed .
" A beautiful object , most strange and peculiarly inspiring , " writes one rare bookseller , of the 1909 Night Mail .
The same could be said of the gilt - and - silver zeppelin that materializes - Millennium Falcon - like - from the star - spangled indigo depths of the book 's cloth - covered boards .
Wow !

6. Olaf Stapledon's Odd John : A Story Between Jest and Earnest ( Methuen & Co. , Ltd. , London , 1935 ) .
Perhaps my favorite Argonaut Folly fiction , Odd John concerns the efforts of an international band of teenage and twentysomething " supernormals " ( or " wide - awakes " ) to form an island colony , where they can devote themselves to " world - building " ( " individualistic communism , " not to mention the founding of a new mutant species ) and " intelligent worship . "
The jacket illustration captures Stapledon 's notion of the titular John : half - child and half - philosopher , ruthless but not malicious , " a creature which appeared as urchin but also as sage , as imp but also as infant deity , " a fallen angel with a face that is " half monkey , half gargoyle , yet wholly urchin , with its huge cat 's eyes , its flat little nose , its teasing lips . "
Cue David Bowie : " Look at your children / See their faces in golden rays / Do n't kid yourself they belong to you / They 're the start of a coming race . "
Homo Superior , that is .

7. E.R. Eddison , The Worm Ouroboros ( London : Jonathan Cape , 1922 ) .
More admired than read , Ouroboros is a linguistically adventurous saga recounting the infinite war between the king of Witchland and the lords of Demonland ... on the planet Mercury .
Call it Nietzschean SF : somewhere out there , the author would have us believe , another world is possible , one in which the self - overcoming values and worldview of Roman , Arab , Germanic , Japanese nobility , Homeric heroes , and Scandinavian Vikings will never be corrupted .
( As Lord Juss puts it : " For better it were we should run hazard again of utter destruction , than thus live out our lives like cattle fattening for the slaughter , or like silly garden plants . " )
The end of Eddison 's novel is also its beginning , hence the title and Keith Henderson 's heavy - metal jacket illustration - a snake devouring itself tail - first .
Like they so often do in medieval engravings , Celtic sculptures , Egyptian scrolls , Aztec glyphs , and on Agent Scully 's lower back .
Wish I could afford a 1st edition .

8. George Babcock , Yezad : A Romance of the Unknown ( Bridgeport , Conn . & New York : Co-Operative Publishing Co. , Inc. , 1922 ) .
Almost as much as I love the Satan - vs . - Martians jacket illustration ( " from painting by the author " ) , I love the novel 's description : " Highly eccentric romance of reincarnation , which includes an account of the colonization of the Moon by near - perfect humans of Mars and the unhappy circumstances of the descent of our ancestors to Earth . "
Mars , it seems , was once a technologically advanced utopia .
Then , 20 million years ago , it lost its atmosphere , so the Martians relocated - but , in doing so , degenerated into our beast - like ancestors .
( Is n't this the plot of Jack Kirby 's The Eternals ?
And Scientology ? )
As for the devil on the dustjacket , the occult point of Babcock 's novel is to inform us that we are divided creatures , within whom Bonality and Malality ( good and bad aspects ) struggle .
Moral : Do n't let Malality triumph , or it might break Martian - filled eggs with its pitchfork .

9. Harold Steele Mackaye , The Panchronicon ( Scribner , New York , 1904 ) .
I 'm informed that The Panchronicon concerns a pair of New Hampshire spinsters who are given the opportunity to travel through time via a solar - powered airship - thing from the 27th - century .
See , first you fly the Panchronicon to the North Pole ; then you orbit the Earth widdershins ( anti- sunwise , like Christopher Reeve does in the 1978 Superman ) ; and presto , you 're in 16th - century England , where you 're able to disprove the Bacon - was - Shakespeare theory .
Meanwile , your drunken shipmate , Copernicus Droop , can attempt to patent the phonograph and the bicycle .
Sounds fun ... but as you 've perhaps intuited , I 'm not convinced that the book is actually worth the effort of reading .
Still , the cover board illustration is awesome .
If this is what 27th - century time - travel technology looks like - part houseboat from Arthur Ransome 's Big Six , part Terry Gilliam machine , part Owlship - then western civilization is inarguably headed in the best of all possible directions .
Sign me up .

10 . E.V. Odle , The Clockwork Man ( London : William Heinemann Ltd. , 1923 ) .
" Of the many works of scientific romance that have fallen into utter obscurity , " writes Brian Stableford , in Scientific Romance in Britain , 1890 - 1950 , " this is perhaps the one which most deserves rescue . "
Eight thousand years from now , advanced humanoids known as the Makers will implant clockwork devices into our heads , devices which permit us to move through time and space - at the cost of a certain amount of agency .
If one of these devices should go awry , a " clockwork man " might appear in the 1920s , at a cricket match in a small English village , behaving strangely .
Worse , like the titular character in Philip K. Dick 's 1969 story " The Electric Ant , " the clockwork man might tinker with his own mechanism .
Bad idea !
NB : This book is extremely rare ; I 've never seen a copy for under $ 500 ... and that 's without the dustjacket .
The illustration is like a Bildungsroman cover re-jiggered by Hannah Höch .
Cool .

AFTERWORD
Since publishing the first post in this series , I 've been inundated with suggestions about terrific - sounding novels from 1904 - 33 concerned with , for example , Artificial Life , Homo Superior , Mad Scientists , Outer Space , and Lost Worlds .
Commenting on my Top Ten Apocalypses post , for example , io9 reader Mathmos suggested :
It does n't fit the Apocalypse category , but I like the title : The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix by Homer Eon Flint .

A Francophone friend of mine emailed to say :
Do n't forget Gustave Le Rouge ( 1867-1938 ) .
Friend of Verlaine , influence on Cendrars and on the Surrealists .
Best books take premises from Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs and go crazy .
A war fought mostly in the air ( before 1914 ) between rival Mormon millionaires in Utah vying for control of sub-Atlantic railroad lines !
A sculptor of human flesh !
The planet Mars ruled by a Great Brain and populated by vampires !

And a fellow PGA SF aficionado forwards these lines from Amazon or Wikipedia :
Leo Saint - Clair , alias the Nyctalope , was created in 1911 by Jean de La Hire , one of France 's most prolific serial writers .
Gifted with night vision , hypnotic powers and an artificial heart , Saint - Clair is a fearless hero who battles colorful super - villains ....
In The Nyctalope on Mars ( 1911 ) , Leo faces the megalomaniacal Oxus , master of the secret society of the Fifteen , who is plotting to conquer Earth from his secret base on Mars .
After defeating the Fifteen , the Nyctalope must then face an ever more fearsome foe : H. G. Wells ' Martians .

All of which makes me worry :
What have I overlooked ?
How can I declare which Alien Invasion and Cosmic Perspective novels from 1904 - 33 are the best of their kind before I 've read Gustave Le Rouge 's Le Prisonnier de la Planète Mars , and Arthur Conan Doyle 's The Land of Mist ?
I 'm going to read these two books , among others , before New Year 's Eve .
I 'll be back , newly confident and opinionated , next month .
But keep the suggestions coming .
Happy New Year !
And please stay tuned .
People across western Canada were treated to a light show yesterday evening that may have come from outer space .
From Alberta to Manitoba last night , people phoned in reports of multi-coloured lights and fireballs that some suspect came from a meteor .
Police were flooded with calls about the sightings .
Also a police dash cam captured the event .
The RCMP in Lloydminster , on the Alberta - Saskatchewan border , had to issue a press release asking people to stop phoning .
The academic community was also buzzing with the reports and experts are now hoping the meteor has left its mark on earth .
But scientists say it will take time to find out whether meteorites fell from the sky since they have n't yet pinpointed the fireball 's exact location .
Meteors usually drop stones within a radius of a few kilometres .
World 's Most Powerful Supercomputer to Help Tackle Global Warming , Develop Renewable Energy
November 15th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
The world ’s most powerful supercomputer , the Cray XT Jaguar , is to be to used in the quest to fight global warming and develop renewable energy .
The computer , housed in the National Center for Computational Sciences ( NCCS ) at Oak Ridge National Labs ( ORNL ) , Tennessee , has been upgraded to a staggering 1.64 petaflops – and put at the disposal of some of the world ’s leading climate scientists and renewable energy experts .
The existing 84 cabinets of the XT4 Jaguar system has been integrated with an additional 200 cabinets of the Cray XT5 , resulting in a machine with more than three times the memory of any other computer in the world .
According to NCCS , key projects that will benefit from the Jaguar upgrade include , the Climate Change Initiative , which “ aims to accelerate discoveries about Earth ’s climate system through lab - wide engagement of scientists and engineers from diverse directorates encompassing energy , environment , computing , and national security ” and ‘ Tap it and Trap it , ’ a project aimed at separating Carbon Dioxide from power plant emissions and pumping it deep underground .
Some of the world ’s finest brains , combined with by far the most impressive example of computing power on Earth – maybe we ’ll start seeing some results to benefit the planet .

Barack Obama has a BlackBerry problem .
He 's hooked on the phone , but he 's about to lose it when he becomes president .
In an interview airing tonight on ABC , Barbara Walters asked the president - elect about how he 's going to handle losing his favorite gadget .
Obama seems to be working on a run-around so he can keep the phone .
ABC News : WALTERS : How are you going to get along without your Blackberry ?
OBAMA : ( Laughs ) .
This is a problem .
I , you know , one of the things that I 'm going to have to work through is how to break through the isolation ... the bubble that exists around the president .
And I'm in the process of negotiating with the Secret Service , with lawyers , with White House staff ...
WALTERS : You might have a Blackberry ?
OBAMA : Well , I 'm , I 'm negotiating to figure out how can I get information from outside of the 10 or 12 people who surround my office in the White House .
Because , one of the worst things I think that could happen to a president is losing touch with what people are going through day to day .
In case you 're wondering , he can't keep the phone because there 's fear that it could be hacked , plus all presidential emails and communications are saved for historical purposes .
If he were do to quickly snap off a flame - mail , he 'd look like an idiot .
Then again , he is a grown adult who we trust to run the country , so he 's probably capable of handling a BlackBerry .

Car companies including GM have invested in fuel cell vehicles , but the technology relies on expensive precious metal catalysts ( Image : dbking http://flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/2213871048/)
Doing away with the use of the precious metal platinum could lead to a new class of low - cost fuel cells , Chinese engineers claim .
Fuel cells produce water and electricity from hydrogen and oxygen , and have been invested in by car makers as a potential alternative to the internal combustion engine .
But they have yet to be widely adopted , in part because the expensive metal platinum is a key component of the design .
In a standard fuel cell , a platinum catalyst at one electrode breaks down hydrogen into protons and electrons .
The protons pass through a proton exchange membrane to a second electrode where they react with oxygen to produce water .
The electrons are syphoned off as electric current .

Platinum has so far been the metal of choice because the membranes used in fuel cells create a very acidic environment , and the metal is stable in such corrosive conditions .
No deposits
Now , though , Lin Zhuang ’s team at Wuhan University in Hubei province , China , has designed a new membrane that is alkali , not acidic – making it possible to use a much cheaper , nickel , catalyst .
The team ’s new polymer proves easy to make into fuel - cell membranes , and can also be mixed with the catalyst itself – this increases the contact between the two components and boosts efficiency .
Previous attempts to change the acidic conditions inside fuel cells involved using liquids , not solids , says Zhang , but they risked forming carbonate deposits that can clog up the cell .
“ There has hitherto been no commercial alkaline polymer electrolyte suitable for fuel - cell use , ” he says .
Many are not stable at temperatures higher than 40 °C , but most fuel cells require more extreme operational temperatures , he says .
Playing catch - up
A working prototype of the new low - cost fuel cell shows a “ decent ” performance of 50 milliwatts per square centimetre at 60 °C .
“ The power output is still lower than that of fuel cells using platinum , but such a comparison may not be appropriate because platinum fuel cells have been studied and optimised for decades , ” Zhuang says .
Allen Bard , a fuel - cell researcher at the University of Texas in Austin , told New Scientist that the new membrane is an interesting idea .
He wonders , though , if it really will be free from carbonate clogging .
“ It may be less of a problem with an alkaline membrane , but it remains to be seen , ” he says .
Bard ’s own research team is trying to develop platinum - free catalysts without changing the conventional acidic membranes .
Palladium - based catalysts have proved almost as effective as platinum ones , says Bard .
But , although cheaper than platinum , palladium is still a precious metal .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) -
The militants who attacked India ’s financial center last month , killing 179 people , also stole credit cards , money and mobile telephones from their victims , Mumbai ’s top police officer said on Monday .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
The stolen goods and currency included thousands of rupees and dollars found on the bodies of the nine gunmen killed by police during the three - day siege in Mumbai .
A 10th gunmen survived and was captured by police .
“ We have no idea what they were planning to do with the money and cards , but it just speaks a lot more about their evil nature and the fact that criminals love stealing money and cards , ” Mumbai Police Commissioner Hasan Gafoor told Reuters .
The attack has soured relations between uneasy nuclear - armed neighbors India and Pakistan .
India has blamed the banned Pakistan - based group Lashkar - e - Taiba for the attacks and called on Islamabad to do more to stamp out groups that operate from its soil .
The gunmen took scores of guests hostage and battled commandos inside two luxury Mumbai hotels .
“ They took quite a few credit cards and a lot of money , ” Gafoor said by telephone .
“ Since they are all dead , we can only presume that they liked the more colorful ( credit cards ) and took them , ” he said .
The 10th gunman , identified as Pakistani Mohammed Ajmal Kasab , told police he had lived a life of petty crime before coming in contact with Lashkar - e - Taiba in the city of Rawalpindi , according to media reports of his statement to police .
Kasab was captured before reaching either of the hotels .
The gunmen also took mobile phones from hostages .
Some of them then used the phones to call an Indian television channel and to speak with their bosses in Pakistan , police said .
Security experts said the gunmen had criminal backgrounds .
“ They all belong to ordinary families and they were out of there early to make quick money until they got indoctrinated into jihadi activities , ” said security expert Major General Ashok Mehta .
The gunmen also set off bombs inside the two hotels , causing significant damage .
The 105 - year - old Taj Mahal hotel will reopen this week , its owner has said .
The hotel has set up a welfare trust for victims .
The following is an excerpt from " What Matters , " the latest book by " Day in the Life " series creator David Elliot Cohen .

In the Ogoniland village of Kpean , an oil wellhead that was leaking for weeks turns into a raging inferno .
Addiction exposes the deepest forms of physical and psychological dependency .
It is typically considered a personal affliction or an individual failing .
But the deadly solicitations of any addictive substance -- cocaine , alcohol , nicotine -- rely upon a social , economic , and political infrastructure .
The great behavioral scientist Gregory Bateson , who studied addiction at the Langley Porter Institute in San Francisco during the 1950s , drew an analogy between the addict and a runaway car precisely to highlight the " system of addiction . "
He wrote : " The panic of the alcoholic who has hit bottom is the panic of the man who thought he had control over a vehicle but suddenly finds that the vehicle can run away with him .
Suddenly , pressure on what he knows is the brake seems to make the vehicle go faster .
It is the panic of discovering that it ( the system , self plus vehicle ) is bigger than he is .
...
He has bankrupted the epistemology of ' self - control . ' "
The crack addict needs the dealer ; the trafficker needs the producer ; and each is embedded in an immense empire of shady government officials , mules , cartel acolytes and peasant growers , as well as a vast shadow world of drug barons , security forces and corrupt governments .
There are those -- social psychologist Stanton Peele is one -- who believe that addiction has become an epidemic of modern society .
Addiction , says Peele , " is not . . . an aberration from our way of life .
. . . [ It ] is our way of life . "
Addiction industries enable and pathologize all manner of behaviors -- from shopping to gambling to drinking to the Internet .
Addiction , in other words , is a peculiarly modern condition , the loss of both personal and social control .
Some addictions are deep , structural and radically destructive ; they expose the morbidities of modern life and of modern capitalism .
There is no better place to read about the pathologies of contemporary addiction than William Burroughs ' " Naked Lunch . "
For Burroughs , a longtime opiate addict , drug addiction is part of a " junk economy " in which the " junk virus " is a parasitic organism that invades and controls increasingly compliant subjects .
In Burroughs ' world , drugs produce a " grotesque consumer " reduced to one " overpowering bodily need . "
Life , he says , telescopes down to one fix .
Drugs are the " ideal merchandise " : no sales talk necessary .
The pusher does not sell drugs to the consumer ; the consumer sells himself to the product .
The addict knows no limit , no control ; he is the capitalist consumer par excellence .
He would , says Burroughs , " lie , cheat , inform on friends , steal , do anything to satisfy total need . "
In Burroughs ' universe , the junk economy is ingrained in a wider economy of control in which the human body is subject to all manner of parasites that multiply in large bureaucracies , complex technologies and multifarious social organizations .
The individual human body , under siege from a " vast hungry host of parasites , " is reduced to what Burroughs calls " a soft machine . "
Burroughs depicts a terminal capitalist world : the deadly deceits of the market , big business , state control and technological terror , and the mass production of mindless subjects .
It is a dark , dystopian vision , but one that speaks directly to the realities that surround us : chronic dependency , demand without limits , violent acquisition and addictive control .
One of these realities is the energy system -- hydrocarbons in general , and oil and gas in particular -- that undergirds our modern way of life .
I want to pose the following question :
Is our dependence on oil a sort of addiction ?
What is the symptomology of petroaddiction , and what are its social costs ?
Is oil , to return to Burroughs , the ideal commodity for neoliberal free - market capitalism ?
Have vehicularized and , increasingly , sport- utilitized American consumers become Burroughs ' archetypical soft machines , beset and enslaved by hydrocarbon capitalism ?
We could begin with President George W. Bush 's 2006 State of the Union address .
America , he said , is " addicted to oil , which is often imported from unstable parts of the world .
" As a former oilman and a former alcoholic , he should know oil addiction when he sees it .
Five years earlier , Vice President Dick Cheney 's National Energy Policy report deployed another word from the lexicon of addiction : Americans ' oil fix could be obtained only through " a dependency on foreign powers that do not have America 's interests at heart " ( my emphasis ) .
What neither man admitted was that America 's oil addiction rested upon a post - World War II " global oil acquisition strategy " -- the language is from Michael Klare 's book " Blood and Oil " -- that now lay in ruins .
America 's oil strategy , a central tenet of U.S. foreign policy since President Roosevelt met King Saud aboard the U.S.S.
Quincy in 1945 and cobbled together their " special relationship , " succeeded in fueling the low - cost , motorized American way of life .
But the true costs of cheap oil -- a vast military presence in the Middle East ; environmental damage , including global climate change ; the need to support corrupt " oilygarchs " -- have never been paid by consumers at the fuel pump .
And a half century of " special relationships " -- or , more precisely , addictive codependencies -- have only produced Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez , Libya 's Muammar al - Gaddafi , Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and , in the end , September 11 , Osama bin Laden 's murderous response to the permanent deployment of American troops in the oil - rich Saudi holy land .
OPEC 's surplus capacity is currently at an all - time low ; there is a deep suspicion that so - called booked reserves -- estimates of recoverable oil -- may be inflated fictions .
Newly motorized economies in India and China need a growing portion of world oil production .
Speculation runs rampant in commodity exchanges , stoked by political turmoil and conflict in many oil - producing states and by " resource nationalism " emboldened by the high prices .
The price of oil rises on fear and conflict , so petro-states can raise the cost virtually at will by provoking crises and conflicts -- usually with the United States .
As a result , international oil companies , national oil companies , and oil - producing states are awash in money .
Their profits are unprecedented .
ExxonMobil , the largest of the international oil companies , has a market valuation of nearly $ 450 billion , or slightly more than the entire GDP of sub-Saharan Africa .
In 2007 , it booked a net profit of more than $ 40 billion , which translates to a stack of dollar bills more than 10,000 miles high .
The national oil companies -- the so - called New Titans that account for 90 percent of global oil reserves and more than one - third of output -- are equally flush .
But to all intents and purposes , they are black boxes -- massively corrupt , completely unaccountable and poorly managed .
One commentator described the Venezuelan national oil company ( PDVSA ) as " a party with the lights out and the music on full blast . "
In 2007 , the OPEC states alone raked in a staggering $ 688 billion .
The Gulf countries each bank roughly $ 5 billion a week .
Hey , addiction pays .
We are now in the midst of the third great oil boom ( the first two being 1973 - 74 and 1979 - 80 ) .
Like previous booms , the current one has transferred unimaginable wealth from oil - importing to oil - producing countries , and from consumers to oil companies .
But the current oil crisis , set against the Global War on Terror , has two novel characteristics .
One is the vast wealth of oil - producing states in a global industry where the best and largest assets are not in the hands of what the Economist calls " the most efficient and best capitalized firms , " namely the major oil companies .
The other is the rank complicity of the American empire , militarism and corporate power .
Not only did a former oilman ( surrounded by a posse of other former oilmen ) stalk the halls of the White House for eight years , but as Kevin Phillips writes in " American Theocracy , " oil now stands at the summit of American politics and " an oil , automobile , and national - security coalition has taken the driver 's seat . "
Contemporary talk of the end of cheap and easy oil -- and the surge of oil prices to more than $ 100 per barrel -- reminds us of the 1973 OPEC oil embargo and President Nixon 's " Project Independence , " designed to achieve U.S. self - sufficiency by 1980 .
For the record , U.S. dependency on imported oil in the late 1960s was 20 percent ; it is expected to be about 66 percent by 2025 .
Nixon 's policy failed miserably , and he resorted to enhancing domestic supply at a terrifying environmental cost and by turning to reliable low - cost foreign suppliers .
" Oil security " -- through unconventional oil sources , enhanced oil - recovery and " green fields " ( i.e. , previously untapped oil fields ; nothing " green " about them ) -- were also talking points thirty years later in the Cheney report .
Alternative energy sources and energy conservation ( both of which would " compromise the American way of life , " as George Bush père put it at the Rio conference on the environment in 1992 ) barely warranted a mention .
Cheney 's motto was always " go where the oil is . "
In 2005 , that meant drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , Wyoming , and Azerbaijan , and raping the vast tar - sands of northern Alberta .
But nowhere has America pursued its search for new oil with more ferocity and dedication than the west coast of Africa , particularly the Gulf of Guinea .
African oil production along the Atlantic littoral has attracted huge exploration investment , and the region will contribute more than 30 percent of the world 's increase in liquid hydrocarbon production by 2010 .
During the last five years , when undiscovered oil fields have become a scarce commodity , Africa has contributed one in every four barrels of new petroleum discovered outside North America .
Africa is Big Oil 's new battleground .
Former oilman Jeremy Leggett writes in his book " The Empty Tank " that energy security has three legs : " The Empire of Oil , " " The Culture of Suppression , " and " The Great Addiction . "
Ed Kashi's photographs of the Niger Delta -- one of Africa 's frontier oil regions -- capture , more powerfully than words , the ugly , violent on - the - ground realities of Leggett 's Holy Trinity at work .
Hear Kashi describe his photos in an audio slideshow »
What is the true nature of oil dependency ?
More than 150 million years ago , massive blooms of microscopic marine plants created a huge blanket of organic material on the sea floor .
In some locations , sedimentation created sufficient pressure to convert -- to cook -- the unoxidized carbon in the organic material into oil , some of which was trapped in reservoirs .
A second phase of oil formation occurred 90 million years ago .
Most oil stayed put until its discovery in 1859 .
With the invention of the gas - fueled automobile in 1901 , black gold became the drug of choice , and its ascent marked the coming of Big Oil .
By the time Sinclair Lewis wrote his novel " Oil ! " in 1927 , the corruption , violence , corporate power and pure ambition that became the oil industry 's hallmarks were already in place in California .
Eighty years later , 90 percent of our transportation is fueled by oil ; 90 percent of all goods involve oil in some way ; and 95 percent of our food products require oil .
( To raise one cow and deliver it to market requires more than 250 gallons of oil . )
Globally , the world consumes more than 80 million barrels every day ; the United States alone accounts for one - quarter of that .
According to most industry expectations , by 2025 global oil consumption will increase by more than 50 percent .
Exactly where this oil will come from is unclear .
The irrefutable reality is that more growth -- the primary objective of capitalism -- means burning more fossil fuel .
Petro-addiction is in large measure an obsession with the automobile and mobility .
The vast corporate nexus of the oil , automobile , and petrochemical industries -- enabled by the military and political power of the American imperial state -- constitutes the system of addiction .
In 1900 , 57 percent of all U.S. - refined petroleum was used in kerosene lamps .
By 1930 , nearly half was consumed by cars .
In the same year , there were 143,000 gasoline stations , 219 vehicles for every 1,000 Americans , and an auto industry capable of absorbing 80 percent of all rubber , 75 percent of all glass , and a quarter of all steel .
Private automobiles now account for more than half of all U.S. oil consumption , and the transportation sector as a whole uses almost three - quarters .
Two - thirds of this oil is imported .
There are now more than 250 million registered vehicles in the United States , one for every 1.2 Americans ; and more than 17 million new vehicles are sold annually .
The growth sector for the last quarter century has been light trucks , a category in which fuel efficiency has deteriorated over time .
The number of gas - guzzling SUVs has grown steadily , from 2 percent of the market in 1975 to more than 25 percent in 2003 .
America 's immediate response to September 11 was slapping flag stickers on SUVs and buying Hummers .
Oil profligacy is the end result of a century - long addiction to motorization , the product not of consumer sovereignty , as the Bush administration suggested , but of the vast corporate power of the oil - automobile nexus .
To what lengths will this addiction be pursued ?
The answer is not simply to the ends of the earth ; the mad pursuit has also taken us to the bottom of the ocean .
Deepwater exploration is the latest holy grail of Big Oil .
On August 2 , 2007 , a Russian submarine with two parliamentarians on board planted a titanium flag two miles beneath the North Pole .
At stake were lucrative new oil and gas fields -- by some estimates ten billion tons of oil -- on the Arctic sea floor .
Two weeks later , it was announced that the fabled Northwest Passage was navigable for the first time in recorded history , facilitating the new oil frontier .
The ecological preconditions for this unprecedented event were , of course , global warming -- another product of Big Oil .
In late 2006 , a consortium discovered oil at a staggering depth in the Gulf of Mexico .
The test well , Jack - 2 , delved through 7,000 feet of water and 20,000 feet of sea floor to tap oil trapped in tertiary rock laid down 60 million years ago .
The drill ships and production platforms required to undertake such deep drilling are massive floating structures , much larger than the largest aircraft carriers and costing well over a half billion dollars ( and close to a million dollars a day to rent ) .
In 2007 , the vast new Tupi field in Brazilian coastal waters was discovered in 200 meters of water below a massive layer of salt in hugely inhospitable geological conditions .
One test well cost more than $ 250 million to drill .
But the addict , says Burroughs , knows no limits to satiate his craving .
The deadly logic of addiction -- the drive to acquire oil at all costs -- is experienced with particular ferocity in the oil - producing states of the equatorial region and global south .
Ed Kashi's work in the Niger Delta documents the existential nightmare of what oil wealth means in reality .
An inventory of the by - products of Nigerian oil production is a salutary , if dismal , exercise : 85 percent of Nigerian oil revenues accrue to 1 percent of the population .
According to former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz , at least $ 100 billion of the $ 600 billion in oil revenues collected since 1960 have simply " gone missing . "
Nigerian anti-corruption czar Nuhu Ribadu says that 70 percent of the country 's oil wealth has been stolen or wasted .
From 1965 to 2004
Nigeria 's per-capita income actually fell from $ 250 to $ 212 , while income distribution deteriorated markedly .
Between 1970 and 2000 , the percentage of people subsisting on less than one dollar a day in Nigeria grew from 36 percent to more than 70 percent , from 19 million to a staggering 90 million .
During the last decade of Croesian oil riches , GDP per capita and life expectancy in Nigeria have , according to World Bank estimates , both fallen .
To conclude , as the International Monetary Fund has , Nigeria 's $ 600 billion in oil revenue has actually contributed to a decline in the country 's standard of living .
No wonder former Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC cofounder Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo dubbed oil " the devil 's excrement . "
Perez proved prophetic .
After nearly four decades of oil riches , Venezuela 's per-capita income is lower than it was in 1960 .
But nowhere is the so - called resource curse more profound and visible than across the Niger Delta oil fields .
For the vast majority of the delta's 30 million people , oil has brought only misery , violence , economic and cultural degradation , and a dying ecosystem .
A United Nations report on human development in the delta concluded , " The vast resources from an international industry have barely touched pervasive local poverty . "
By conservative oil industry estimates there were almost 7,000 oil spills between 1970 and 2000 , more than one each day ( the real figure might be twice or three times that number ) .
Gas flaring ( burning off natural gas released by oil drilling ) in the delta produces 70 million metric tons of carbon emissions a year -- " a substantial proportion of worldwide greenhouse gas , " according to the World Bank .
A World Wildlife Fund report released in 2006 simply referred to the Niger Delta as one of the most polluted places on the face of the earth .
By almost any measure , Nigeria 's oil - producing states are a calamity .
The United Nations estimates that between 1996 and 2002 , the human development indices ( education , life expectancy , income ) actually fell in the core oil - producing states .
Since 2000 , the rage felt by marginalized and unemployed men across the Niger Delta has taken a militant turn .
In late 2005 an armed insurgency erupted in the creeks of the Delta , led by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND ) .
For the better part of two years , the Niger Delta has been more or less ungovernable -- effectively a war zone .
The history of our addiction to oil is a chronicle of violence , corruption and the worst excesses of frontier capitalism and social Darwinism .
It was the case when the Nobel and Rothschild families grappled for control of Caspian Sea oil in the late nineteenth century ; it is just as true now in the Gulf of Guinea .
Like crack , tobacco or any other addiction enabled by a vast , powerful industry ( Is it surprising that Big Tobacco financially supported global warming skeptics for years ? ) , our oil addiction is hugely destructive , defies logic and is nearly impossible to break .
But unlike crack and tobacco , we will eventually run out of oil .

Europe exists , it appears .
If Greek students sneeze , or catch a whiff of tear - gas , young people take to the streets in France and now Sweden .
Yesterday , masked youths threw two firebombs at the French Institute in Athens .
Windows were smashed but the building was not seriously damaged .
Then youths spray - painted two slogans on the building .
One said , " Spark in Athens .
Fire in Paris .
Insurrection is coming " .
The other read , " France , Greece , uprising everywhere " .
It was a calculated and violent attempt to link disparate youth protest movements .
Links between protests in Greece and France – and , to a lesser degree , unrest in Sweden – may seem tenuous , even non-existent .
But social and political ailments and their symptoms transmit as rapidly as influenza in the television , internet and text - message age .
With Europe , and the world , pitching headlong into a deep recession , the " Greek Syndrome " , as one French official calls it , was already being monitored with great care across the European Union .
The attempt to politicise and link the disputes across EU frontiers may prove to be a random act of self - dramatisation by an isolated group on the Greek far left .
But it does draw attention to the similarities – and many differences – between the simultaneous outbreaks of unrest in three EU countries .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Thousands of young Greeks have been rioting on and off for almost two weeks .
They are protesting against the chaotic , and often corrupt , social and political system of a country still torn between European " modernity " and a muddled Balkan past .
They can be said , in that sense , to be truly revolting .
The riots began with a mostly " anarchist " protest against the killing of a 15 - year - old boy by police but spread to other left - wing groups , immigrants and at times , it seemed , almost every urban Greek aged between 18 and 30 .
The protesters claim that they belong to a sacrificed " €600 " generation , doomed to work forever for low monthly salaries .
French lycée ( sixth - form ) students took to the street in their tens of thousands this week and last to protest against modest , proposed changes in the school system and the " natural wastage " of a handful of teaching posts .
In other words , they were engaged in a typical French revolution of modern times : a conservative - left - wing revolt , not for change but against it .
The lycée students are , broadly , in favour of the status quo in schools , although they admit the cumbersome French education system does not serve them well .
But behind the unrest lie three other factors : a deep disaffection from the French political system ; a hostility to capitalism and " globalism " and the ever - simmering unrest in the poor , multiracial suburbs of French cities .
In Malmo on Thursday night , young people threw stones at police and set fire to cars and rubbish bins .
This appears to have been mostly a local revolt by disaffected immigrant and second - generation immigrant youths , joined by leftist white youths , against the closure of an Islamic cultural centre .
As in Greece and France , the Swedish authorities believe the troubles have been encouraged , and magnified , by political forces of the far left .
There may be little direct connection between the events in the three countries but they were already connected in the minds of EU governments before yesterday 's attack on the French cultural institute .
The French President , Nicolas Sarkozy , forced his education minister , Xavier Darcos , to delay , then abandon his planned reform of the lycée system this week .
Why the change ?
Largely because of the events in Greece , French officials say .
There was a heated debate in the Elysée Palace last weekend .
One faction of advisers and ministers wanted to push ahead with the school reforms ( already much watered down ) .
Another faction was disturbed at signs that the lycée protests , although relatively limited , were spinning out of control .
The student leaders were no longer in charge of their troops , they said .
Violent elements were joining the marches from the poor , multi-racial suburbs .
Far left and anarchist agitators were said to be getting involved .
With the Greek riots on the TV every night , and the French economy heading into freefall , the officials feared the lycée protests could spark something much wider and more violent .
President Sarkozy agreed to give way .
The lycée protests went ahead anyway .
There were more students on the streets of French cities on Thursday , after the government backed down , than there were last week when the education minister insisted that he would press ahead .
A few cars were burnt and overturned in Lyons and Lille and a score of protesters were arrested but the marches were mostly peaceful .
Students interviewed on the streets of Paris refused to accept that the reforms had been withdrawn .
President Sarkozy was not in control , they said .
He was " under orders from Brussels and Washington " .
The real motive was to take money out of the French education budget to " refloat the banks " .
The Greek , French and Swedish protests do have common characteristics : a contempt for governments and business institutions , deepened by the greed - fired meltdown of the banks ; a loose , uneasy alliance between mostly , white left - wing students and young second - generation immigrants ; the sense of being part of a " sacrificed generation " .
Saturday October 11 , 2008 ( foodconsumer.org ) --
German researchers found that cells taken from men's testicles could be used to grow certain types of adult cells or tissues , making it possible for scientists to sidestep the controversy over use of human embryonic stem cell research .
In the Oct. 8 early online edition of the journal Nature , Thomas Skutella , professor at the Center for Regenerative Biology and Medicine in Tuebingen in Germany and colleagues reported that they succeeded in isolating and growing the testicular cells into specific adult cells .
Early studies have shown that spermatogonial cells from the testes of mice behaved like embryonic stem cells and could be tricked to grow into certain types of adult cells .
The current study is the first of its kind to show that men also have the same stuff like mice have to offer .
The cells used in the study were taken from biopsied tissue from 22 men ages from 17 to 81 .
The researchers found it took only a few weeks for the cells to differentiate into various types of cells .
Skutella and colleagues could only turn the germline cells into a number of adult cells , but not other types .
And also the cells used were taken from whole testes although the researchers said part of a testis may also be functional .
" It 's exciting .
We could do it for males ; that leaves women without as easy a method , " stem cell scientist George Daley of Children 's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute was quoted by the AssociatePress as saying .
Early , Japanese scientists have found that skin cells may act like embryonic stem cells and be use to growing certain types of adult cells .
But the method involves use of a virus that may integrate itself into the DNA in the cells resulting in cancer - causing mutation .
Skutella ’s method can not only solve this problem , but also have another advantage over the method based on skill cells .
That is , the spermatogonial cells can be taken from a patient and growed into adult cells or tissue and then transplanted in the same patient without fearing the body rejecting the transplanted tissue .
Skutella was cited y news media as saying that women 's egg cells may also function like cells from male testicles in terms to be used to grow cells .

FSFE and GPL - Violations.org on Reporting ( and Avoiding ) Licensing Issues
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 09 , 2008
The FSF Europe 's Freedom Task Force and GPL - Violations.org have jointly prepared a few guidelines on how to best report ( and avoid ) license violations .
Some of the advice is common sense ( suspected violations are best handled in private , reported only to the involved parties , and organizations such as GPL - Violations and the appropriate branch of the Free Software Foundation ) , but reminders are always useful , especially in the heat of the moment .
The guide illustrates that reporting a possible license violation should be as specific as filing a bug report .
Forwarded email threads , if necessary , should only include pertinent information .
Links to the project , the parts of the code involved , as well as the license by which the code is protected should be included .
The guide also advises that reports detail how those filing the complaint interpret the license as having been violated .
The approach here is twofold , and the guide is also clear on how to respond if you 've been informed of a possible code violation .
The main points are that it 's important to take the suspected violation seriously , but that reported violations can come from a variety of sources with varying ( and not necessarily correct ) interpretations of the licenses used .
Even if two out of three reports are n't violations , they all need to be examined to sufficiently determine this .
The guide does n't claim to be legal advice , and suggestions given wo n't necessarily apply to every licensing situation that will arise .
It is a solid starting point for those creating new and modifying existing code to reasonably approach potential issues and , hopefully , avoid them altogether .
This guide should help ease some fears about open source adoption -- and code modification and redistribution .
Handling GPL license violations has historically been a civil affair , with a majority of those violating the licenses simply fixing the error ( it 's only repeated , willful violations that prompt legal action ) .
GPL - Violations.org has a fairly comprehensive FAQ for vendors , and answers questions about source code release requirements .

C/NOFS was launched this year
The upper reaches of Earth 's atmosphere are much lower than expected , a US Air Force satellite has found .
Currently , the ionosphere - a layer of charged particles that envelops the planet - is at an altitude of about 420 km , some 200 km lower than expected .
The behaviour of the ionosphere is important because disturbances in its structure can upset satellite communications and radar .
The C/ NOFS satellite 's data will be used to try to forecast such problems .
" C/ NOFS is focussing on one small aspect of ' space weather ' which is the impact of the upper atmosphere - a region called the ionosphere - on radiowaves that try to get from satellites down to the ground , " said Don Hunton , the technical manager on the satellite programme at the US Air Force Research Laboratory .
" Sometimes the ionosphere interrupts satellite communications and sometimes it does n't , and we 're trying to understand how to forecast , or predict ahead of time , when those problems are going to arise , " he told BBC News .
Study platform
The ionosphere is a weak plasma - a layer where ultraviolet light from the Sun has so excited the upper atmosphere that its constituent atoms and molecules have been broken apart into free electrons and positive ions .
And just as light waves will be bent as they pass through water , so radiowaves will refract when they move through the charged particles that make up the ionosphere .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The C / NOFS ( Communication / Navigation Outage Forecasting System ) was launched back in April and put into an elliptical equatorial orbit at altitudes between 400 and 860 km to investigate this enigmatic layer .
Its sensors record the density and temperature of the plasma , as well as the strength and direction of electric and magnetic fields within it .
One of C / NOFS ' first discoveries has been simply to identify where precisely in the sky the ionosphere is right now ; and it is a lot lower than expected .
During the night it has been detected at about 420 km , rising to 800 km during the day .
Scientists here at the American Geophysical Union meeting said more typical values would be 640 km during night - time and about 960 km during the day .
Future forecasts
To some extent , this should not be too surprising .
The ionosphere reacts to the Sun 's 11 - year cycle of activity and our star is currently in a very quiet phase .
" We are in the depths of a very low solar minimum right now and as a result the ionosphere is lower and less dense than , we believe , at any other time in the history of the space age when measurements have been made , " said Dr Hunton .
But despite this quiescence , C / NOFS has still managed to witness a fair amount of activity in the ionosphere .
It can see structures , or bubbles , in the layer .
It is these features that will distort , weaken , or even block radiowaves trying to pass through to the ground .
C/ NOFS ' mission will be to try to understand how these structures start and evolve so that some warning can be given of their impact on satellite transmissions .

BARBOURVILLE , Ky -- Deep in the Appalachian woods , Kentucky State Police Trooper Dewayne Holden 's Humvee struggled up what once was an old logging trail .
As his three - truck convoy stopped at a clearing atop a 3,000 - foot ridge , Holden grabbed a machete and joined eight other armed troopers and National Guardsmen , hiking toward a hill under some power lines .
But the pot growers had beaten them to the prize :
Gone were the 40 to 50 marijuana plants worth as much as $ 100,000 that Holden spotted from a helicopter more than a week earlier .
Only six spindly plants and some fresh ATV tracks were left .

How long do you think that will go down well with the far better - known top of the ticket , who hardly has enough hair to sweep over the top , let alone up ?
Her eyeglass frames are flying off the shelves .
Stories on her routinely rank among the most - read on this website and others .
In nine months we should check the Social Security Administration 's listing of most popular baby girl names .
With Sen. John McCain , the presidential nominee standing there grinning , their joint crowds spontaneously break out in chants of " Sa-rah ! Sa-rah !
Sa-rah ! "
Her upswept hairstyle is reportedly being widely copied , according to people who notice such things .
Judging by the news coverage in recent days -- and by measurable reader response to items about the Alaska governor , including this widely - viewed Palin fashion photo gallery -- Palin is No. 1 on the Republican ticket , even though she 's really No. 2 .
Sarah Palin is no William Miller .
Nor is she a Spiro T. Agnew .
Both those guys were Republican political nobodies picked by prominent presidential candidates ( Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon ) to go along and fill out the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket bec ause somebody had to do it .
... political oblivion of the largest state , where her approval rating had slipped to 80 % , about 10 times better than Congress ' approval rating .
And McCain threw her onto the national stage .
Where she did n't stumble .
Yet .
This surprise really angered many , including some in the national media , whose members are generally so well connected to Democrats that they knew Barack Obama 's VP pick was Joe Biden almost as quickly as Joe Biden did .
But the Republicans are something else .
They had the nerve to make a surprise pick and keep it a surprise that hardly anyone knew until the last moment .
OK , The Ticket did have an advance inkling .
So the McCain campaign paid a price in not always the best coverage for a few days until Palin 's convention speech gave some 37 million TV viewers their very own first impression .
From the McCain camp 's point of view , the priceless beauty of the initially dubious news coverage , with its often catty , gotcha tone , was that it dramatically lowered the bar of expectations .
If Sarah Palin walked onto that St. Paul stage in anything other than a halter top and fishnet stockings with a slit skirt , she would be a huge hit , guaranteed .
Palin 's pronounced if practiced normalcy -- talking about " my guy , " snowmobiles and hockey moms -- actually energized what was previously scheduled to be another somnolent , soporific session for the GOP , naming two more white guys in well - pressed suits and new haircuts tearing themselves away from their investments and the golf course long enough to give this White House business a go .
Alaska 's first female governor even won over Rush Limbaugh , the conservative broadcast grump who 's all for the Palin - McCain ticket now .
Before the first janitor swept the first speck of confetti off the floor of the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul last Thursday night , McCain and Palin were off together on their political honeymoon -- to Milwaukee , of all places .
And they have campaigned together ever since .
According to campaign notes passed on by The Times ' Maeve Reston , McCain 's closest aide , Mark Salter , today said , " They 're having a good time together .
They 're riding a lot of momentum coming out of the convention . "
Reston notes in her own story that McCain is a noticeably feistier , more energetic candidate with Palin around .
Funny how that works .
Gov. George W. Bush 's campaign handlers had Laura travel with him all fall of 2000 for precisely the same reason .
Never mind the media complaints , it 's a smart strategy for the McCain camp to give Palin a few days to gain her campaign legs and voice , get comfortable with her new staff and the talking points before sending her out solo , probably later this week .
Palin was n't on any of the Sunday morning talk shows this weekend , which gave the Democrats a momentary talking point .
" If she 's afraid to talk with Tom Brokaw , how 's she gonna handle Vladimir Putin ? "
Putin , of course , has no vote on Nov. 4 .
And the trouble is , all the yada - yada programs ended up talking about Palin anyway in absentia .
Even the top of the Democratic ticket had to talk about the Republicans ' No. 2 , a real no -no in the traditional rules of political engagement .
It 's one thing to enter a knife fight against Sen. Hillary Clinton in the pantsuit primaries .
( And , by the way , did you notice how she took a pass at taking a swipe at Palin this weekend ? )
It 's another thing to take on a hockey mom of five who gets everyone breakfast before driving herself off to run a state , hunts on the weekends , helps her husband with their joint commercial fishing business ( see photo ) and still manages to look great for the 5 p.m. news , when she vows to veto a bill that would bar health benefits to same - sex partners .
Sunday , off doing her homework , Palin did n't -- could n't -- make any mistakes .
Later this week , ABC News ' Charles Gibson will interview Palin several times back on her home Alaska turf , as she sends her 19 - year - old Army son off to Iraq .
Gibson 's a pro .
He 'll ask some hard questions .
And they wo n't be about Fairbanks traffic .
The governor had better be ready .
If the emerging pattern fits , ABC will get a ratings bonanza as the nation pursues its raging Sarah curiosity .
And one thing about the media that 's just like life back in high school : the harder those dates with Sarah are to get , the more desirable they become .

“ NO NO NO .
Not just no , but HELL NO , ” writes Richard , a reader from Anchorage , Alaska .
“ This is robbery pure and simple , ” Anna from Denver posted on CNNMoney.com ’s TalkBack blog this weekend .
“ It ’s our money !

After President Bush petitioned Congress Saturday for the authority to spend up to $ 700 billion to to bail out a financial industry on the verge of collapse , he said the high price tag was not only justified , but essential .
“ It is a big package because it ’s a big problem , ” Bush told reporters at a news conference .
“ The risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of the package . ”
But when asked what they thought of the government ’s proposal , most readers gave an overwhelming thumbs down .
“ I ’m tired of rewarding institutions and people for the bad decisions they have made , ” said Dean from Madison , Wis .
“ Sure , it will hurt tax payers if / when some of these institutions fail , but perhaps we need to let that happen .
We do not need more big government involved in our lives .
Enough is enough . ”

Mr Yushchenko said he would call a poll unless a new coalition was formed Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko has threatened to dissolve parliament and call elections after the collapse of the country 's ruling coalition .
Mr Yushchenko's supporters walked out in protest on Tuesday night following new laws to trim presidential powers .
The laws were introduced by the opposition and backed by Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's bloc .
Former allies , the prime minister and president are now at odds despite sharing pro-Western political goals .
All but one of 12 ministers from Mr Yushchenko's party boycotted Wednesday 's cabinet meeting .
" A political and constitutional coup d'etat has started in the parliament , " Mr Yushchenko said in a televised speech .
" I will use my right to dissolve parliament and decree early elections if a new coalition is not formed within 30 days , " he said .
' Work continues ' Under Ukrainian law , parliament has 30 days to form a new coalition after one is dissolved , and another month to put together a cabinet .
Until then , the previous government continues its work .
Analysts said that with the current coalition still legally in force , Mr Yushchenko had no formal authority to push for a new alliance .
Profile : Viktor Yushchenko Profile : Yulia Tymoshenko
Ukraine 's tenuous double act Ms Tymoshenko blamed her rival for the chaos , vowing that the Ukrainian cabinet would continue its work despite the break - up of the coalition .
" Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko declares that there is no alternative to the democratic coalition , " her party said on its website .
In a televised address , Ms Tymoshenko said : " I am sorry that the president behaves irresponsibly .
The coalition was destroyed under his instruction . "
" I am convinced that the work of the democratic coalition will be renewed .
You have 10 days ... to return to the democratic coalition , " she added .
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse , in Kiev , says the coalition has been weak since it was formed and has been teetering on the brink of collapse for some time .
This move is seen by many as the first shots in a presidential campaign in which Mr Yushchenko and Ms Tymoshenko are both candidates , our correspondent says .
Polls have shown that Ms Tymoshenko would win a presidential election , with Yushchenko coming last .
In a parliamentary election , she would increase her seats , while Mr Yushchenko 's Our Ukraine party would lose some .
If parliamentary elections are called , they would be the third in as many years since the 2004 " Orange Revolution " , which swept Mr Yushchenko to power .
Western integration
He campaigned on a ticket of greater Western integration including joining Nato and the European Union .
The BBC 's regional analyst Steven Eke says Mr Yushchenko's popularity is at rock bottom at the moment with opinion polls giving him single - digit levels of support .
The crisis follows mounting tension between the president and prime minister with Mr Yushchenko accusing Ms Tymoshenko of treason for allegedly siding with Moscow over the conflict in Georgia .
Mr Yushchenko has been a vociferous supporter of Georgia during the conflict but the prime minister 's party on Tuesday blocked a parliamentary resolution condemning Moscow .
The flare - up comes a day before a planned visit to the country by US Vice - President Dick Cheney .
The trip is part of a tour of former Soviet states which the US sees as key allies .

Fugitive British criminals living in Spain found an uncomfortable spotlight turned on them yesterday as a list of the 10 most wanted was released .
Crimestoppers and the Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) issued descriptions of a list of individuals they want to track down for a variety of offences including murder , rape , drug trafficking and kidnap .
All of the fugitives are believed to be hiding in the Costa Blanca area around Alicante and Crimestoppers appealed to expats living in the country to look out for the nine men and one woman .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The new hunt has been codenamed Operation Captura 2 after an original operation to track down 30 criminals on the Costa del Sol in October 2006 led to 13 arrests .
Each one of the 10 has been pictured and named online on the Most Wanted section of the Crimestoppers website www.crimestoppers-uk.org although legal constraints mean that only the scantest details of their alleged crimes have been included .
Among the fugitives featured in Operation Captura 2 are a convicted rapist , Andrew Alderman , and a kidnapper , Dean Rice , as well as an alleged heroin smuggler , Shashi Dhar Sahnan .
Alongside them is Adam Hart , 29 , who is suspected of conspiracy to supply cocaine and who escaped arrest in August 2007 as police officers searched his workplace .
Also on the list is Alan Gordon , 46 , who is wanted by police in Scotland for supplying drugs .
Police are also trying to find Andrew Snelgrove , 45 , who also uses the name Edward and is accused of attempted murder , wounding with intent and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life .
Scottish police also want to track down Anthony Kearney , 43 , and Donna McCafferty , 41 , both suspected of fraud – they use a variety of aliases .
Also on the list accused of fraud is Hungarian - born Dennis Hunter , 57 , who is accused over a major attack on the VAT system .
Meanwhile , Thomas Cochran , 50 , who also used the alias Thomas Caldwell and has a dagger tattoo on his right arm , is accused of drug dealing .
For many years , Spain has proved to be an appealing hideaway for British criminals fleeing imprisonment .
But that changed in 2004 when European arrest warrants came into effect , making it easier to bring offenders back to the UK to be tried .

Crimestoppers ' founder and chairman Lord Ashcroft said : " We are extremely proud of the success of Operation Captura and Most Wanted , which highlights how well the working partnership has gone with ourselves , Soca , the British embassy and the Spanish authorities .
With 13 arrests from 30 appeals so far , it is great to know that both UK and Spanish residents are helping law enforcement to capture these dangerous individuals by passing on information , which ultimately helps make their communities safer .
" We are now appealing to the public in the UK and particularly expats in Spain to look carefully at the 10 new appeals and to pass on information they may have about them to Crimestoppers in total anonymity . "
Bill Hughes , director general of Soca , said : " This is an innovative partnership which is proving to be very successful , and is delivering a simple message to criminals ; you wo n't escape to the sun , we will find you and bring you back . "
Since Crimestoppers began in 1988 , the appeals have resulted in more than 87,000 arrests and charges .
On the run Accused
* Andrew Alderman was sentenced to 10 years in his absence for the rape and indecent assault of a young girl .
The 49 - year - old from Canterbury , Kent , was on bail awaiting sentence when he disappeared on 31 August 2006 .
Police immediately realised he had gone abroad after he was caught on CCTV at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Folkestone , Kent , in the early hours of that morning .
Known to speak several languages , including Spanish , he is described as 5ft 10in , with a dark complexion and a lot of body hair , short , stocky , with greying dark hair and brown eyes .
Earlier this year his 14 - year - old victim 's mother appealed to holidaymakers to help find him : " It 's a living nightmare for my daughter who has not seen justice served .
He still has his liberty while she lives with the scars everyday of what he did . "
Detective Inspector David Berry , from Kent Police , said it was a " rare occurrence " for a rape suspect to be granted bail .
* Dean Rice skipped bail and was jailed for life in his absence for his part in a horrific kidnap of an ex-employee .
Alan Clarke was grabbed off a Camden street as he walked his dog .
The kidnappers included the construction businessman Trevor Crouch and Rice 's wife , Nichole .
They kidnapped Clarke because they thought he had stolen their money .
At Crouch 's trial in Maidstone , Andrew Espley , prosecuting , said Mr Clarke had suspected Rice was involved in smuggling drugs .
He had been taken to a farm near Ashford , Kent , where he was assaulted and tied up , had a gun held to his head and repeatedly asked where the money was .
He jumped from a window to escape .
Crouch , 39 , described as the hired muscle , was jailed on charges of conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to falsely imprison .
Nichole Rice , 41 , and Michael Kelly , 63 , were jailed for five years .
Rice , 47 , is 5ft 3in , of medium build with brown eyes , straight black greying hair and possibly a beard or moustache as well as a tattoo on his right arm .
He has used the aliases Dean Borton and Steven Greenfield .
* Shashi Dhar Sahnan stands accused of smuggling £ 1.5 m of high - grade heroin into Britain .
The drugs were hidden in packaging surrounding air - conditioning units but the operation was foiled when Customs officers at Birmingham International Airport seized the drugs during a joint operation with Leicestershire Police in July last year .
The seizure led to the arrest of 15 men and three women who have all been released on bail pending further inquiries .
Mr Sahnan , 51 , is described as 5ft 8in , of proportionate build with short straight , greying hair and brown eyes .
He wears a hearing aid in his right ear .
Demand for Sony products is being badly hit by the downturn Sony has announced plans to cut 8,000 electronics jobs - 5 % of the division - as well as shutting 10 % of its manufacturing sites .
The company said the jobs would be cut by April 2010 , but did not say in which countries the staff would go .
Sony said it would also cut at least 8,000 temporary and contract staff jobs in the same sector .
It said it had been trying to reduce production because of the downturn , but warned it still had to do more .
The news came as Japan said its economy had shrunk between July and September by much more than initially estimated .
The Cabinet Office said the economy had shrunk at an annual rate of 1.8 % in the quarter , compared with its original estimate of 0.4 % .
Investment cut Sony said the cost - cutting plan was aimed at responding to " the sudden and rapid changes in the global economic environment " .
Sony aims to generate cost savings of about 100bn yen ( $ 1.1 bn ; £ 730 m ) by the end of the next financial year .
It will cut its investment in electronic operations by 30 % and shut down about 10 % of its 57 production facilities .
" The number sounds big , but this staff reduction wo n't be enough , " said Katsuhiko Mori , a fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments .
" Sony does n't have any core businesses that generate stable profits - the next thing we want to see is what is going to be the business that will drive the company . "
Last month , Sony reported a 71 % fall in net profit for the three months to the end of September , compared with the same period in 2007 .
Its net profit for the quarter was 20.8 bn yen , down from 71.8 bn yen for the same three months last year .
Sales were down 0.5 % at 2.1 trillion yen .

Why Are They Assholes ?
Cuckoo bird parents like to use something called Brood Parasitism to raise their kids , which sounds like something involving alien monsters bursting out of their chests .
The reality is n't all that much better .
What happens is female cuckoos lay their eggs in some other birds ' nest , where the little baby cuckoo , already born in full - asshole - mode , will try to get rid of the nest owners ' real chicks and eggs by kicking them out of the nest , sending them plunging to their doom .
That way , the nest owner will feed the intruding little psychopath instead of actually raising their own young .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
You may be wondering why a bird would raise a cuckoo chick that obviously does n't look anything like his real chicks .
Perhaps you 're imagining the male bird suspecting that the female has been having an affair with an old high school flame , never daring to confront her about it as he slowly sinks into alcoholism before blowing his own brains out with his old army pistol .
Okay , honey , I am going to ask you just one more time .
Have you been porking the UPS guy ?
Well , no .
Most birds are just really fucking stupid and they figure that if it's in their nest , it has feathers and it 's asking for food , then it 's probably theirs .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Some birds , though , are a bit smarter and try to refuse to raise cuckoo chicks by either throwing away cuckoo eggs or even completely abandoning their own nests if all that is left is a cuckoo egg inside .
And that 's when they get visited by the Cuckoo Mafia .
Hey , do n't look at us , it 's actually called the Mafia Hypothesis .
If a bird refuses to raise a cuckoo , then it gets visited by some adult cuckoos who will beat the crap out of them , trash the nest and possibly kill a few of their young in the process until the other bird wises up and stops asking questions the next time one of his kids look a little bit different .

Daily News Journal Billie Watts , left , pictured with her grandson , Michael Peralta , found $ 97,000 in a Cracker Barrel restroom and made sure the money was returned the to its owner .
MURFREESBORO , Tenn .  A Murfreesboro , Tenn. , woman chose not to follow the old saying " Finders keepers , losers weepers " when she discovered nearly $ 100,000 in a bag at a local Cracker Barrel restaurant .
But it was n't that the thought did n't cross her mind .
" Satan will tempt you , " said Billie Watts , 75 .
" I have been having real bad teeth problems .
I thought , ' I 'll get my teeth fixed . ' "
She ultimately decided to return the money she found in a bag in the women 's restroom to its rightful owner .
Watts had to be coaxed by Michael Peralta , one of her 12 grandchildren , to tell her story .
" I 'm proud of her because if anyone in the world deserved to find $ 97,000 it was them , " Peralta , 31 , said of his grandparents , who live in an apartment and depend on their Social Security checks .
The excitement began when Watts stopped by the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store with her husband , Malcolm , Thursday afternoon .
In the bathroom , she found a tapestry bag hanging on a hook on one of the stall doors .
" It had a Manila envelope that was sticking out of the bag , " she said .
" It could n't zip up ; it was too full . "
She searched the bag for the identity of its owner .
Inside the envelope was a picture of two women and a child , but no names .
Then she spotted the money .
" I said ' Oh my goodness , ' " Watts recalled Monday .
" I have never seen that much money in my whole life .
I counted the money .
There was $ 97,000 in one - thousand - dollar bills .
They were neatly stacked inside the bag .
" Watts decided to leave the restaurant with the money .
" I was afraid to go to the counter , " she said .
" Maybe the wrong person could get ahold of it . "
After the couple returned home , Watts called the Cracker Barrel restaurant .
" I told them I found something in the bathroom .
I just left my number and asked them to call me . "
In 10 to 15 minutes , a woman called .
" I knew it was the right person when she called .
She identified the picture , the envelope and the money , " said Watts .
" I met her in front of the Cracker Barrel about 15 to 20 minutes after she called me . "
In the restaurant 's parking lot , the woman who left the money got out of her car and approached Watts .
" She run up and hugged me .
She got excited and did n't even look at the bag except to pull out the picture to show it to me , " said Watts .
" She said it was the only picture she had of her daughter and her daughter 's child , who are both deceased . "
The money , the woman told Watts , was the proceeds from the sale of her home and all the belongings in it .
" She was going to start her new life in Florida with her son , " said Watts .
The woman offered to pay Watts $ 1,000 , but Watts refused it .
" ( The woman ) told me she needed every penny she could to start over , " said Watts .
" ( The money ) was n't mine .
I had no right to it .
My mom and dad told me never to take anything that did n't belong to me . "

A steam pipe explodes near Grand Central Terminal , leaving one passer - by dead , injuring dozens of others and forcing a number of businesses to close .
A fire rips through a home in the Bronx , killing 10 members of two immigrant families from West Africa .
Most people got news of these major New York stories from television , radio , the newspaper or , more and more , the Web .
But some of the first hints that something big was happening came from a series of transmissions from outside the five boroughs .
Those messages came from a strip mall in New Jersey and were sent to pagers and computers in newsrooms in New York City and beyond .
The mall is home to a company called the Breaking News Network , started in the early 1990s by twin brothers who were working as electronics salesmen and who believed that journalists eager for a scoop would pay for a pager service that transmitted fragments of conversation culled from radio frequencies used by emergency responders , including police officers and firefighters .
After 85 Years , First Gremlin Found Alive
Everyone should know about Gremlins .
They are those little furry creatures that if you get them wet , they multiply and if you feed them after midnight , they turn pretty evil .
Well I cannot say for sure that the food and water part are real , but apparently a Gremlin , mouse - sized primate called a Pygmy Tarsier , has been found alive for the first time in 85 years .
Hiding in the mountaintops of a cloud forest in Indonesia , these little Gremlins weigh about 2 ounces , have large eyes , claws instead of fingernails , and are covered in fur to keep warm in the damp and cool environment .
Last seen in 1921 , the Gremlins were thought to be extinct until this recent discovery .
We only hope the Indonesians will keep them out of the sun , dry , and avoid feeding them after midnight .

Mexico has deployed some 40,000 troops in its anti-drug crackdown A $ 197 m ( £ 133 m ) aid package to help Mexico fight drugs cartels has been released by the US government .
It is part of the Merida Initiative , a $ 400 m ( £ 270 m ) scheme to assist Mexico 's efforts to take on the drugs trade .
US Ambassador Tony Garza formally unveiled the programme , which includes the donation of helicopters and surveillance aircraft , in Mexico City .
Mexican newspaper El Universal says at least 5,000 people have been killed in drugs - related violence this year .
The newspaper , which has been keeping tallies for the past four years , said that the number of people killed by organised crime was on course to be double the 2,700 deaths registered in 2007 .
Deaths had been happening at an average of one an hour during the past 42 days , El Universal said .
Corruption fears
In the last two years , Mexican President Felipe Calderon has deployed more than 40,000 troops , along with federal police , in a crackdown on drug gangs in the country .
Mexico is in the midst of a major campaign against immensely powerful cartels that traffic cocaine and other drugs to consumers in the United States , says the BBC's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City .
Ninety percent of all the cocaine consumed in the United States is believed to reach the country via Mexico .
President Felipe Calderon , has long sought , and been promised , financial aid from Washington to try to defeat the traffickers .
The initiative is part of a $ 1.6bn ( £ 1.1 bn ) US plan to help train and equip security forces and strengthen justice systems in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean .
The aid has been held up for months , partly because US legislators were concerned that the money might end up in the hands of corrupt Mexican officials .
None of the $ 197 m which has just been released will be in the form of cash .
Instead equipment is being provided to enable American and Mexican law enforcers to work more closely together .
Forces unleashed
The deal comes at at time when the drug war in Mexico appears to be having increasingly violent .
In Tijuana last weekend , for example , there were 25 murders , including nine decapitations .
What the numbers signify is open to interpretation , our correspondent says .
The Mexican Government says that the increased killings are often the result of leaderless drug gangs turning on each other for the fewer spoils that remain .
But some analysts fear that by taking on the drug runners , President Calderon has unleashed forces he arguably will not be able to control .
There is plenty of evidence that Mexican law enforcement agencies have been extensively infiltrated by the cartels .
The government is having to rely on the army to police parts of the country .
Mr Calderon says his war on drugs will be long and difficult .
In that , he is being proved right , our correspondent says .

At the request of the Federal Trade Commission , a U.S. District Court has issued a temporary restraining order halting the sale of keylogger spyware .
According to the FTC ’s complaint , the Florida - based CyberSpy Software , LLC marketed and sold RemoteSpy keylogger spyware to clients who would then secretly monitor unsuspecting consumers ’ computers .
The FTC seeks to permanently bar the unfair and deceptive practices and require the defendants to give up their ill - gotten gains .
According to papers filed with the court , the defendants provided RemoteSpy clients with detailed instructions explaining how to disguise the spyware as an innocuous file , such as a photo , attached to an email .
When consumer victims clicked on the disguised file , the keylogger spyware silently installed in the background without the victims ’ knowledge .
This spyware recorded every keystroke typed on the victim ’s computer ( including passwords ) ; captured images of the computer screen ; and recorded Web sites visited .
To access the information gathered and organized by the spyware , RemoteSpy clients would log into a Web site maintained by the defendants .
Defendants touted RemoteSpy as a “ 100 % undetectable ” way to “ Spy on Anyone .
From Anywhere . ”
According to the FTC complaint , the defendants violated the FTC Act by engaging in the unfair advertising and selling of software that could be : ( 1 ) deployed remotely by someone other than the owner or authorized user of a computer ; ( 2 ) installed without the knowledge and consent of the owner or authorized user ; and ( 3 ) used to surreptitiously collect and disclose personal information .
The FTC complaint also alleges that the defendants unfairly collected and stored the personal information gathered by their spyware on their own servers and disclosed it to their clients .
The complaint further alleges that the defendants provided their clients with the means and instrumentalities to unfairly deploy and install keylogger spyware and to deceive consumer victims into downloading the spyware .
On November 5 , 2008 , the FTC filed its complaint and requested a temporary restraining order against the defendants from the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida , Orlando Division .
Under the terms of the order approved by the court , in addition to halting the sale of their RemoteSpy software , the defendants must disconnect from the Internet any of their servers that collect , store , or provide access to information that this software has gathered .
The complaint also names Tracer R. Spence – the registered agent and manager of the
Orlando , Florida - based CyberSpy Software – as liable and culpable for the charges made in this case .
The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and request a temporary restraining order was 4-0 .
A complaint filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( “ EPIC ” ) brought the RemoteSpy software to the FTC ’s attention .
An update on this litigation can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/11/cyberspynr.shtm
NOTE : The Commission authorizes the filing of a complaint when it has “ reason to believe ” that the law has been or is being violated , and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest .
A complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have actually violated the law .
The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent , deceptive , and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot , stop , and avoid them .
To file a complaint in English or Spanish , visit the FTC ’s online Complaint Assistant or call 1-877-FTC -HELP ( 1-877-382-4357 ) .

During the past few decades , a mounting body of evidence has shown that animals possess a number of cognitive traits once thought to be uniquely human .
Bees “ talk ” through complex dances and sounds ; birds act as “ social tutors , ” teaching song repertoires to their young ; monkeys use tools and can sort abstract symbols into categories .
Yet the more scientists learn about the similarities between human and animal thought , the greater the need to explain the dramatic divide .
Are the human faculties associated with language simply an advanced version of capacities that are found in animals , or do they represent something that is qualitatively new ?
This puzzle has drawn the attention of professor of psychology , organismic and evolutionary biology , and biological anthropology Marc Hauser , who has written widely on human and animal cognition .
Drawing on a range of recent studies that link the fields of linguistics , biology , and psychology , Hauser has attempted to isolate the aspects of human thought that account for what he terms “ humaniqueness . ”
He maintains that even though human brains have inherited many of the raw abilities observed in nonhuman animal species , a divergence arises from the ways in which multiple capacities interact in humans , allowing them to convert information into myriad forms to serve infinitely diverse ends .
Hauser supports his argument with comparative examples .
“ Some of the capacities that are critical for language acquisition , ” he says , “ are in fact present in other species , but used toward more specific nonlinguistic purposes . ”
Take the concept of singular and plural .
Experiments with rhesus monkeys have revealed that they always prefer “ many ” over “ one ” of a desired object , suggesting that the singular / plural distinction exists in nonhuman primates and thus likely precedes the evolution of language .
But the monkeys do n’t distinguish among different gradations of “ many ” — by opting for three objects over two , or four over three , for example — unless the objects are presented sequentially .
Humans , on the other hand , through their novel system of language syntax , have transformed and complicated the way the primitive singular / plural relationship is thought about and represented .
Songbirds offer a further illustration of both the connection and the gap between animal and human faculties .
Birds learn songs in much the same way that humans acquire language .
There ’s a critical early window in which exposure to certain stimuli is necessary ; and , as with language , bird songs consist of highly structured sounds that are combined and recombined to create new songs .
Yet in the case of birds , different combinations of sounds do n’t change the song ’s message .
Individual variations serve to distinguish one bird from another , like an accent , but the song means only one thing ( i.e. , “ I ’m a territorial male … if you ’re a female and want to mate , come find me ” ) .
“ It ’s not that birds do n’t have thoughts about the world , ” Hauser says .
“ They do .
But the combinatorial ability does n’t get mapped onto the ability to create meaning , the way it does with language — allowing humans to combine and recombine sounds constantly to create different words and expressions . ”
Hauser describes animals as having “ laser - beam ” intelligence , in which each cognitive capacity is locked into a specific function .
Humans , by contrast , have “ floodlight ” intelligence , he says : they can use a single system of thought in multiple ways and can translate information from one context to another .
“ Animals , ” he elaborates , “ live in a world in which the systems do n’t talk to each other . ”
Take tool use , for example .
In 1960 , when Jane Goodall discovered a chimpanzee using a grass stalk to catch termites , a long - held theory about human uniqueness fell apart .
“ But the significance of tool use does n’t lie in the fact of tools , ” Hauser explains , “ but rather in how they ’re conceived and used . ”
Animal tools consist of only one material and have only one functional part , while human tools have evolved over time to be made of various materials and have multiple functions .
A knife can be used to cut food , open a box , or stab an intruder .
Forty years of research , he reports , have not revealed any evidence that animals can use one tool for multiple purposes .
Hauser summarizes the distinguishing characteristics of human thought under four broad capacities .
These include : the ability to combine and recombine different types of knowledge and information in order to gain new understanding ; the ability to apply the solution for one problem to a new and different situation ; the ability to create and easily understand symbolic representation of computation and sensory input ; and the ability to detach modes of thought from raw sensory and perceptual input .
Across the board , Hauser says , there are signs that animal evolution passed along some capabilities “ and then something dramatic happened , a huge leap that enabled humans to break away .

Precisely how and when this happened , we may never know . ”

A Gaza - based journalist , whose name was withheld for security reasons , told CNN he heard 18 blasts in the area and that two fires were burning at the compound early Tuesday .
More bombs continued to drop over Gaza through the morning .
With Tuesday 's bombs , Israel appeared to extend its airstrike campaign in Gaza to a fourth day .
The strikes -- which Israel says are aimed at stopping the firing of rockets from Gaza into southern Israel -- have killed more than 375 Palestinians , most of them Hamas militants , Palestinian medical sources said Tuesday .
At least 60 civilians have been killed in Gaza , U.N. officials said .
About 650 people have been wounded there , according to the Palestinian medical sources .
Monday , Israel 's defense minister said the nation was in an " all - out war " with Hamas , the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza .
" We have stretched our hand in peace many times to the Palestinian people .
We have nothing against the people of Gaza , " Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Israel 's parliament .
" But this is an all - out war against Hamas and its branches . "
Israel continues to strike Hamas targets in Gaza , an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN .
Mortar fire along the Gaza border late Monday killed one Israeli soldier and wounded four others , he said .
Earlier Monday , columns of smoke rose over Gaza City as warplanes carried out strikes .
Though there was no indication of an Israeli military ground operation in Gaza , Israeli tanks cruised along the territory 's edges .

Iyad Nasr , a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross , said the streets of Gaza were largely empty during airstrikes Monday morning .
Despite the airstrikes , militants fired more than 40 rockets and mortar shells into Israel on Monday , according to Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld .
More than 150 rockets have been launched into Israeli territory since the campaign began , Israel Defense Forces said .

Six Israelis have died over the past three days , five of them civilians .
One of the rocket strikes killed an Israeli at a construction site in Ashkelon , 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) north of Gaza , and wounded eight others , a hospital spokeswoman said .
Rocket strikes killed an Israeli and wounded two others at Kibbutz Nahal Oz , according to Israeli police and hospital spokespersons .
Rocket attacks also wounded two people , one seriously , in Ashdod .
One woman who was critically injured during the attack died later during an operation , according to Israeli medical sources .
The White House on Monday called on Hamas to halt rocket fire against Israel , so calm can be restored in Gaza .

Israel has struck more than 300 Hamas targets since Saturday , its military said .
The Israeli air force carried out at least 20 airstrikes on Gaza on Monday , Israeli military sources said .
Hamas security sources said the targets included the homes of two commanders of Hamas ' military wing , the Izzedine al - Qassam Brigades , in the Jabalya refugee camp just north of Gaza City .
Neither commander was among the seven people killed in those strikes , the sources said .
The Israeli military had no immediate comment on a report by Dr. Mu'awiya Hassanein that a strike near a mosque in Jabalya killed five children in a nearby home .
The situation triggered protests in Iran , Greece , Britain and Lebanon , and the Iranian government declared a day of mourning for Palestinians in Gaza .
Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei urged the world 's Muslim populations to unite against Israel 's attacks on Hamas in Gaza .

" All true believers in the world of Islam and Palestinian fighters are duty - bound to defend the defenseless women and children in Gaza Strip and those giving their lives in carrying out such a divine duty are ' martyrs , ' " Khamenei said through Iran 's official news agency IRNA .
U.S. and Israeli officials told CNN that Hamas militants in Gaza have received support from Iran in the past in the form of weapons , training and cash .
" We know of Hamas operatives , commandos and soldiers who were trained in Iran itself .
We know that .
So there is a close cooperation and exchange of know - how and activities , " said Isaac Herzog , a member of the Israeli Security Cabinet .
Iran denies any involvement with Hamas .
But an Iranian official told CNN Iran has ties to Shiite groups such as Hezbollah , a political party in Lebanon with alleged terrorist roots .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon condemned Hamas for the rocket attacks , but also had strong words for Israel .
" While recognizing Israel 's right to defend itself , I have also condemned the excessive use of force by Israel in Gaza .
The suffering caused to civilian populations as a result of the large - scale violence and destruction that have taken place over the past few days has saddened me profoundly , " he said in a prepared statement .
The U.N. Security Council called for both sides to immediately end the violence , but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Sunday that the campaign could last " for some time , " and his Cabinet voted to call up 7,000 reservists .
So far , about 2,000 reservists have been activated , according to the government .

Hamas pledges it will defend its land and people from what it calls continued Israeli aggression .
Each side blames the other for violating an Egyptian - brokered cease - fire .
The truce formally expired December 19 , but it had been weakening for months .
Mustafa Barghouti , a Palestinian parliament member , flatly blamed the violence on the Israeli " occupation " of the Palestinian territories and dismissed Israeli claims that it is targeting only Hamas .

" This is not a war on Hamas ; it is a war on the Palestinian people , " he said .

Both Barak and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni will be vying in February for the prime minister 's post against Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu .
Both Barak and Netanyahu have previously held the post .
The ongoing assault and threat of Israeli military ground incursion caused panic in Gaza City , the territory 's densely populated capital , a U.N. humanitarian official told CNN on Monday .
" It 's very bad , people are running in all directions because of the bombings that are happening everywhere , " Karen AbuZayd said from Gaza City .
AbuZayd is the commissioner - general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency , which provides assistance to about 80 percent of Gaza 's 1.5 million residents .
Israel allowed more than 50 trucks carrying relief aid into Gaza on Monday -- in addition to 40 on Sunday -- Israeli military sources said .
The U.N. is expecting 100 trucks Monday , but a U.N. official said it will not be enough to alleviate the worsening humanitarian situation .
In the West Bank , Saeb Erakat , adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , urged Israeli and Hamas leaders to put another cease - fire in place .
The power base of Abbas ' Fatah party is in the West Bank .
The party is locked in a power struggle with Hamas , which won parliamentary elections in January 2006 and wrested Gaza from Fatah in violent clashes last year .
Abbas , a U.S. ally , wields little influence in Gaza .

California ’s Fair Political Practices Commission ( FPPC ) confirmed Monday that it will investigate allegations that the LDS Church failed to report nonmonetary contributions to the Yes on Proposition 8 campaign .
An independent nonprofit organization , Californians Against Hate , called for the investigation after the measure passed earlier this month , effectively ending same - sex marriages in that state .
“ They read my letter and I guess came to the conclusion that there ’s something worth looking into , ” said Fred Karger , who heads Californians Against Hate , which was formed to track donations in support of the ballot initiative .
“ I ’m hopeful that the LDS Church will cooperate and share all the records and all the information they have about their activities in the Proposition 8 campaign . ”
Karger , a retired political consultant , alleged in his complaint that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints failed to report money invested to organize phone banks , send out direct mailers , provide transportation to California , mobilize a speakers bureau , send out satellite simulcasts and develop Web sites as well as numerous commercials and video broadcasts ….
Karger , however , sees the fact that FPPC is moving forward as a good sign .
He said his political attorney told him the commission looks into fewer than 5 percent of complaints , an indication in his mind that “ when they do it , it ’s pretty serious . ”
There has been a lot of speculation about the effect of Coca Cola on the human stomach .
There were those that said that the popular beverage could literally cause our intestines to melt if we drink to much of the stuff .
Coca Cola always denied the rumors and said that their product is no worse than other soft drinks on the market and there was no official proof of the “ dissolving effect “ .
So a bunch of guys decided to conduct their own experiment and find out if the rumors are true .
They just took a piece of red meat , put it in a plate and poured some Coca Cola over it .
They left it there for two days and took some photos throughout their experiment .
The Coke did n’t completely dissolve the meat but you can see that it does n’t look like anything you ’d like to have inside your body .
And the smell was unbearable .
I ’m sure pretty much everyone knew that Coca Cola was n’t the healthiest drink on the market , but I for one did n’t think it could do that to flesh .
No more Coke for me !

Was Charged with Implementing the Discriminatory ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' Policy in 1990s ...
Jon Ponder Byon

Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
In 1993 , when he served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Pres. Clinton , Colin Powell was a leading advocate of the military 's " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " ( DADT ) policy that essentially allowed gay people to serve only if they agreed to stay in the closet .
Now , in an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN , he says it 's time for the policy to be reviewed .
Transcript ( at 03:10 on the Video ) :
FAREED ZAKARIA : Let me ask you about one social issue you were associated with , which was " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " --- the policy toward gay people being in the military openly .
Do you feel like the country has moved to a place where we could reevaluate " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ? "
POWELL : We definitely should reevaluate it .
It 's been 15 years since we put in " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , " which was a policy that became a law .
I did n't want it to become a law , but it became a law because Congress felt that strongly about it .
But it 's been 15 years , and attitudes have changed .
And I think it is time for the Congress , since it 's their law , to have a full review of it .
And I 'm quite sure that 's what Pres. - Elect Obama will want to do .
This indicates a radical change in Powell 's thinking on this issue .
In 1993 , he was in charge of implementing the military 's policy toward gays .
Here are highlight of his position on the issue , as compiled by Emma Ruby - Sachs at Huffington Post :
He said [ in 1993 ] , " I continue to believe strongly that the presence of homosexuals within the armed forces would be prejudicial to good order and discipline . "
( USA Today , November 16 , 1992 ) In support of this position , Powell told Ted Koppel that in the military , " we have to shower together . "
According to the San Francisco Chronicle 's coverage of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testimony to Congress on DADT , Powell stated , " ' cohesive teams of warriors who bind so tightly ' that they can charge into machine gun fire could not be sustained with known homosexuals among their number . "
He further testified that he would be troubled if a soldier of his showed up at a gay pride parade dressed in drag .
( San Francisco Chronicle , July 21 , 1993 ) ...
Yesterday , Powell may have asked for a review of the discriminatory policy of the military .
But he is still on record justifying the exclusion of LGBT people , equating sexual orientation with lifestyle choices and is personally responsible for the termination of 9,488 employees under DADT since 1993 .
It was disconcerting back then that someone as worldly as Powell was such an adamant homophobe , especially since he belonged to a minority that had been the object of equally vile discrimination by the military in his lifetime .
Like Nixon , the old red-baiter , engineering the rapprochement with Communist China , as DADT 's former champion , Powell is in a unique position to lead the charge to end this illogical , divisive and discriminatory policy .
With his endorsement of Obama , and in this and other recent interviews , Powell seems to be seeking redemption .
Taking on the role of the Republican militarist who makes the case to the public for ending " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " would be a start .
Oil and gas major ConocoPhilips and coal giant Peabody Energy applied for a permit yesterday to build a plant in Muhlenberg County , Kentucky to turn coal into synthetic natural gas .
What interests me are not so much the details of their project but the fact that it ’s just one more example of what a longtime source of mine , Gasification Technologies Council CEO Jim Childress , calls stealth coal .
Childress uttered this colorful term while I was interviewing him on Chinese versus U.S. developments in coal gasification for power generation using integrated gasification combined cycle or IGCC technology .
( ‘ Combined cycle ’ because it uses a gas turbine to generate power from expanding combustion gases plus a steam turbine that generates power from the heat released . )
My conclusion , reported today for MIT TechReview in China Closes the Clean - Coal Gap , is that climate concerns have paralyzed IGCC projects in the U.S. whereas air quality concerns are helping push Chinese projects forward .
Stealth coal figures in Childress ’ argument that neglect of IGCC technology in the U.S. does not mean we ’re through with generating electricity from coal .
To the contrary .
As utilities turn to natural gas for more and more of their baseload power generation , they will drive demand for gas beyond what drilling can deliver .
Childress predicts that coal - to - gas plants such as the ConocoPhillips - Peabody Energy project will keep the gas - fired plants running :
Right now coal plants in the planning stages are stopped dead in their tracks and the default fuel is natural gas .
So we ’re looking at a tightening of the natural gas market and that ’s good news for coal gasification .
It may not go [ directly ] to power but it will substitute for natural gas .
To my ear the word stealth makes coal - derived synthetic gas sound kind of sinister but its climate impact could be negligible according to a University of Kentucky study cited yesterday by Green Car Congress .
Visual thinkers may prefer this report by Fox News on Dakota Gasification , the synthetic gas operation that pioneered carbon capture and storage in the U.S. ( I ’d send you to CNN , but they just axed their entire science , environment and technology team . )
Of course , one should also consider the environmental costs of coal mining .
We ’ve written recently about upstream impacts of mountaintop - removal mining in Appalachia .
Yesterday Kentucky ’s governor Steve Beshear focused instead on coal development ’s economic impact — about 1,000 construction jobs and 200 full time jobs for a $ 1 billion plant according to a Louisville Courier - Journal report .
Beshear translates that into political terms in Peabody Energy ’s press release on their proposed gas plant : “ Projects like this … enjoy rock solid support :
More than 80 percent of Kentucky residents support coal gasification . ”
I ’m not sure about Governor Beshear ’s poll data , but one thing ’s for sure :
There ’s nothing stealthy about his feelings for coal .

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Cindy Bischof was not the kind of woman who would normally let a boyfriend get in the way of her career .
Driven , persistent , productive , she was everybody 's favorite partner at Darwin Realty , a commercial real estate firm on the outskirts of Chicago .
She was a role model to the firm 's young women , a mentor to junior brokers , a 43 - year - old overachiever : in at 5:30 A.M. , networking at lunch , so smart about heavy industry that her peers voted her Industrial Broker of the Year .
Cindy was neither submissive nor easily intimidated - which is why what happened to her on March 7 is all the more shocking .
For nearly a year Bischof had been trying to untangle herself from a soured five - year relationship with an out - of - work salesman named Michael Giroux .
After their breakup in May of last year , according to friends , family , and police reports , the handsome and charming Giroux suddenly turned strange and dangerous .
The day they broke up , Bischof changed the locks on her house .
That night she went to stay with her parents .
Giroux smashed the back windows of her house , broke in , and threw paint all over her furniture , rugs , and appliances .
Giroux began calling her incessantly on her cell phone .
He stalked her at her house , at her parents ' house , even on the golf course .
Bischof 's torment became Darwin Realty 's nightmare as her co-workers rallied around her .
They helped clean up the damage to her house , which cost her $ 70,000 , according to police reports .
The head of Darwin 's construction department installed a camouflaged infrared deer - hunting camera in the bushes of her backyard to take pictures of her deck at night .
In August , it caught Giroux there with a rope , making a noose .
Darwin's president , George Cibula , arranged for Bischof to move into a rental property 30 miles away in Plainfield so that Giroux could n't find her .
Cibula hired security guards for the company Christmas party .
Sometimes Cindy 's partners walked her out to her car at night , just in case .
But Bischof was alone that Friday afternoon in March as she left her office and headed to her car , looking forward to joining her parents at her condo in Estero , Fla .
Minutes later , Brian Liston , a Darwin partner working in a corner office , heard four gunshots behind him .
He turned and there , outside his office window , lay Bischof , face down on the parking - lot pavement .
Giroux , wearing a baseball cap and a fake mustache , had been lying in wait at the tire store next door .
He shot and fatally wounded her before shooting himself in the head .
While police spent hours investigating the obvious , employees huddled in the hallways and conference rooms as shock turned to horror and then to unbearable grief .
" It 's still not over , " Cibula said months later , choking up .
" All you can do is endure the shock of it . "
As the boss , he does n't know what he could have done differently .
He could n't shield his staff from the trauma .
No amount of security would have stopped so determined a killer , he believes .
" If everybody brings their problems to work , pretty soon you 're a psych hospital , " he says .
" Cindy knew that , and she tried .
But we butted our way in anyway because she was our friend . "
Employing perpetrators and victims
Domestic violence is still a taboo topic in most of corporate America , and no wonder .
Logic wo n't address it .
It carries a great stigma .
It raises difficult questions in high - powered workplaces that employ - let 's face it - both perpetrators and victims .
Many executives believe the issue has no place at work .
What happens at home is supposed to stay at home , especially matters of the heart .
In a survey of 200 CEOs sponsored by Liz Claiborne Inc. ( LIZ , Fortune 500 ) last year , most agreed that domestic violence was a serious issue , but 71 % said they did n't believe it was a problem at their own companies .
Only 13 % felt that corporations need to play a major role in addressing domestic abuse .
Soon , though , they may have no choice .
Employee attitudes , demographics , and the efforts of some CEOs are converging to drag this issue out of the closet .
With so many women in the workforce , and with e-mail , text messaging , and cell phones connecting them to the office around the clock , domestic violence comes to work whether executives like it or not .
Employees are well aware of this .
According to the Liz Claiborne survey and another conducted for Verizon Wireless ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) last year , an overwhelming majority of workers wish employers would develop policies to deal with it .
To press the point last month in New Canaan , Conn. , home to a disproportionate number of top executives , a small army of police officers , volunteers , and high school athletes and coaches showed up at the train station at 5:30 A.M. one morning to hand out domestic violence information to commuters bound for Grand Central Station .
" What is not in sync here is that the average person on the street knows what 's going on , but company programs have not kept pace to help employees , " says Dede Bartlett , a former senior officer of both Exxon and Altria who is part of the " domestic violence underground railroad " that quietly helps women like those in this story .
" This takes top - down leadership , " she says .
" It 's got to be the CEO . "
Now a small but growing group of CEOs is saying that it 's time for corporate America to confront the issue head - on .
Domestic violence affects the bottom line , they say .
It threatens workplace safety .
As an HR issue , it 's much more volatile and potentially dangerous than drug addiction or alcoholism .
" I 'd like to see more done about this , " says Thomas J. Wilson , CEO of Allstate , one of the CEOs who sees it as a major issue affecting employees , customers , or both .
At Verizon Wireless , which handled about 100 abuse cases internally in the past year and roughly 225 more through its employee - assistance programs , " the numbers speak for themselves , " says Martha Delehanty , vice president of human resources .
" This is an issue we must address . "
Talkback :
Is domestic violence a workplace problem too ?
Tell us what you think
Although Liz Claiborne made it a corporate cause nearly two decades ago , William J. McComb says he was stunned at what he learned about domestic violence after moving to Liz from Johnson & Johnson two years ago .
" We have a responsibility here , " the CEO says .
" More leaders in the business community need to understand this issue better . "
One in ten a victim
Take a look around you .
One in ten of your colleagues is probably a victim of domestic abuse , according to recent research by two professors at the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas .
In a study of three large companies spanning 39 states , 10 % of workers who responded to survey questions said , " Right now I am going through this , " says Anne O'Leary - Kelly , a management professor who conducted the study .
( Though she and co-author Carol Reeves got the same results from both men and women , their research indicates that women are abused much more frequently and severely . )
An additional 19 % of the men and 30 % of the women said they 'd been victims at some point in their lives .
" We were startled , " says O'Leary - Kelly .
" Those numbers suggest a large number of employees are struggling to juggle this personal situation with their jobs . "
Contrary to popular opinion , studies show that battered women are more likely to be employed than not .
And spousal abuse occurs at work with surprising regularity , O'Leary - Kelly and Reeves found - 19 % of current victims said some abuse was occurring at work .
The reasons become clearer when you understand what domestic abuse is and what it 's not .
It is n't just spillage from an abnormally bad marriage .
It ca n't be chalked up to problems with self - control or alcoholism or anger management , though it can be mixed up with all those .
It 's not really about love or jealousy ; it 's about subjugation - an obsessive need to control one 's partner .
The International Space Station ’s new urine recycling system appears to have been fixed after several rounds of modifications ( Image : NASA )
NASA appears to have resolved problems with a new urine recycling system on the International Space Station , bolstering hopes it will be able to expand the research outpost ’s crew next year , officials at the space agency said on Tuesday .
Reusing wastewater is essential for doubling the size of the crew living aboard the station from three members to six , especially since the space shuttles , which produce water as a by - product of their electrical systems , are to be retired in two years .
The device , part of a $ 250 million new life - support system aboard the station , shut down during three previous attempts to purify urine .
NASA wants the visiting shuttle Endeavour crew to bring home processed samples for analysis before declaring the water purification system suitable for use .

Two rounds of modifications to stabilise the device ’s centrifuge appear to have worked , flight director Brian Smith said on Tuesday .
It completed a full five - hour run on Monday and was nearing completion of a second full run early on Tuesday .
Engineers planned to keep the device operating all day in hopes of producing enough processed urine before Endeavour ’s departure on Friday .
The device was ferried into orbit and installed in the station ’s Destiny laboratory after the shuttle arrived on 16 November .
Rotating joint
The shuttle ’s stay at the station was extended a day to wait for the samples .
“ We ’re going to try to keep it going all day and have the crew just reload the ( urine ) tank as it gets low , ” Smith said .
Also Tuesday , NASA tested the station ’s newly repaired solar wing rotary joint , which was cleaned and restored during four spacewalks by Endeavour astronauts .
The joint had been contaminated by metal filings , prompting NASA to lock it in place to prevent damage .
Immobilising the wing , however , prevented panels from tracking the Sun for full power .
While the crews slept , engineers on the ground watched as the joint automatically pivoted to track the Sun for the first time in a year .
“ There ’s months worth of testing left to go before we can really determine what impact all four ( spacewalks ) had on that joint , ” Smith said .
Endeavour is due back at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday after 16 days in orbit .
NASA plans eight more flights to the station , a $ 100 billion project of 16 nations , before the shuttles are retired in 2010 .
This list of troubled banks and lenders expands .
Britain ’s Northern Rock was nationalized last year after a run on the bank and just over a year later , it ’s the UK ’s Bradford & Bingley who are about to be taken over by the government .
Also in talks this weekend is Fortis , a major European bank , who is seeking money to stay afloat .
( Be cautious of any bank out there that offers interest well above the market norm because that suggests an urgent need for cash reserves . )
Who will be the next to fall ?
Phil Gramm ’s UBS seems to be defying gravity considering their $ 38 billion write - downs but then again , maybe there are plenty of people out there who are willing to invest billions to cover years of financial losses .
Just because it has n’t worked elsewhere so far – as we witnessed with Lehmen , who failed and buyers moved in without buying old debt – does n’t mean a miracle can’t happen .
But several veterans of the White House have noted in conversations over the past two years that the secure video does not lend itself to open , vigorous debate .
Instead , it can squelch it .
The picture is being piped into too many places ; field commanders do n’t want to speak their mind to the president if their immediate superiors at the Pentagon or Central Command are tuned in , too .
There may be recordings for posterity , or presidential libraries .
One recently departed National Security Council official noted earlier this year that in his view , the problem is that the system is largely in the hands of war - fighters ; only on a rare day , and only toward the end of his presidency , did members of Provincial Reconstruction Teams and other aid workers involved in nation - building pop up on Mr. Bush ’s screen .
“ The technology tends to skew the nature of the advice you hear , ” this former N.S.C. member said , declining to speak on the record because the sessions he witnessed were classified .
“ You spend a lot more time talking about hitting a house of full of bad guys in Waziristan than you do talking about why our effort to build schools and roads is moving so slowly . ”
It is not yet clear what Mr. Obama thinks of the high - tech toys he will soon have at his disposal , but at the announcement of his new national security team on Monday in Chicago , he was clearly aware of the problem they can accentuate .
“ One of the dangers in a White House , based on my reading of history , is that you get wrapped up in groupthink and everybody agrees with everything and there ’s no discussion and there are no dissenting views . ”
He insisted he would be “ welcoming a vigorous debate inside the White House . ”
A few hours later , ABC News broadcast an interview in which Mr. Bush told Charles Gibson that “ the biggest regret ” of his presidency arose from his administration ’s best - known group - think debacle .
“ A lot of people put their reputations on the line and said weapons of mass destruction is a reason to remove Saddam Hussein , ” Mr. Bush said , according to the White House transcript .
“ And you know , that ’s not a do - over , but I wish the intelligence had been different , I guess . ”
Mr. Bush , once again , declined to be drawn into the great what - if of his presidency :
Would history had been different if the Iraq intelligence had been accurate , or if someone on one of those screens had debated the implications if it turned out to be wrong ?
He had designed the 2002 “ Bush doctrine ”  the declaration that after 9/11 , the United States could no longer take the risk of allowing imminent threats to the country gather  for a world in which technology allowed near - perfect information flow , enabling the president to make accurate , black - and - white calls about whether that threat exists .
Instead , in its first application to a real - life conflict , the debate turned into an endless feedback loop , reinforcing faulty assumptions .
People talked about how many days would be required to get to Baghdad , not whether the evidence for invasion was good enough , or the possibility that the occupation would go awry .
Even the face - to - face discussions took on an element of virtual reality .
Do not dishonor your father 's brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations ; she is your aunt .
Do not have sexual relations with your daughter - in - law .
She is your son's wife ; do not have relations with her .
Do not have sexual relations with your brother 's wife ; that would dishonor your brother .
- Lev. 18:14-16
forbidden
My Religion prof pointed out that the reason repeatedly given in this passage for not having sex with a female relative is that it would bring dishonor on the male to whom she belongs .
Of all the reasons not to have sex - consensual or otherwise - with your mother , the one given ( ostensibly ) by God is that it would dishonor your father .
Not you .
Not her .
Her husband .
It occurred to me that this might explain why a Biblical prohibition on premarital sex is difficult to find .
( Maybe I should have another contest . )
Apparently the violation of a woman is less deplorable if she has no male lord to be dishonored by it .
Indeed , Deut. 22 says that a man who rapes a betrothed woman must die , but a man who rapes a woman who is not betrothed must pay her father the bride - price and marry her .
And they can never be divorced .
If I understand this correctly , a man who rapes a betrothed girl has committed a far greater sin than a man who rapes a girl who is not yet betrothed .
( Bear in mind that in this society everyone gets married , and does so as soon as they 're physically able to bear children .
So a girl who is not yet pledged to be married is probably younger than one who is .
Probably prepubescent . )
Following the logic of Lev. 18 , it seems that in the first case the rapist brings disgrace to the girl 's betrothed , for which he must die , whereas in the second case he has sinned against the girl 's father ( who had the right to choose his daughter 's husband ) for which he must pay the father a pound of silver .
This second sin is not a serious one because he has not stolen what is another man's , but merely claimed it for himself - albeit in a somewhat unscrupulous manner .
I 'm not going to dwell on what I think about forcing rape victims to marry their attackers , but the word " abhorrent " comes to mind .
In fact I can't think of many thingsin the Bible that strike me as so cruel and reprehensible as what is commanded here .
I 've heard the argument that the ancient Near East was a brutal and barbaric place , and that the Mosaic Law was far less brutal and barbaric than anything else at the time , and that it would have been impossible in that context to introduce a 21st century - or even first century - legal code , so God just did the best he could .
I can accept this argument , to a point .
( I 'm not a Kantian . )
I can accept that ancient Jews may not have been ready for the concept of gender equality .
And I might be able to accept that God would permit slavery in this context ( I 'm not entirely sure ) so maybe I can accept that God would permit women to be treated as property .
But I cannot accept that God would order rape victims to marry their attackers .
Bear in mind that I 've only been thinking about this for a few hours , and I have n't really done any research yet .
So if you have some insight in this matter please let me know .
Either way , I 'd like to hear what you think of this .
Are you as sickened by this law as I am ?

Det här kommer att bli en magisk tillställning !
JFK said " Victory has a thousand fathers , but defeat is an orphan . "
So I 'm here to claim Linux - based geek paternity for the successful presidential campaign of Barack Obama .
The geeks did n't do it alone , of course .
But their role was huge .
I had been following that role ever since covering the Howard Dean Presidential Campaign back in '03 - 04 for Linux Journal .
Get your flashbacks at Saving the Net , The Syndication Solution , Letters from the Campaign Pressure Cooker , Hacking Democracy , Lessons on Open Source Politics from the Campaign Forge  in that order .
So , when it became clear that there was lots of geek power operating in and around the Obama campaign , an assignment developed : write about it for the November '08 issue of Linux Journal , which would hit the stands in late October , just before the election .
This I did .
After working hard on researching and writing the piece , and whittling it down to three thousand words , it turned out that we had more than enough purely Linux - related stuff for that issue , and the piece was shelved until after the election , which is where we are now .
Rather than update the piece with more recent data and quotage , I decided to run it as I wrote it in August .
To my surprise , the story is n't stale .
Instead it marks a point  one among many  when history was being made .
One suspected that at the time .
One knows it now .
Here goes .
August 11 , 2008
Since the dawn of mass media , the most obvious activity of political campaigns  especially presidential ones  has been image - making .
You paint a flattering portrait of your candidate and an unflattering one of his or her opponent .
In the 2008 presidential campaign " cycle " ( as the professionals call it ) , the candidate with the best paint job so far ( as of mid-August , when I 'm writing this ) has been Barack Obama .
In " What Obama Can Teach You About Millenial Marketing " Advertising Age says , ... the unabashed embrace of select brands by millennials , from technology to beverages to fashion , has made this decade a true golden era of marketing for those who know what they 're doing .
And " ... when it comes to marketing , the Barack Obama campaign knows what it 's doing .
Mr. Obama 's brand management , unprecedented in presidential politics , shows pitch - perfect understanding of the keys to appealing to the youngest voters ...
His success , it seems , is a result of both product and the branding behind it . "
Reading this I am reminded of Isaac Asimov 's distinction ( in Second Foundation ) between " the answer that satisfied " and " the answer that was true " .
Because much of the Obama campaign 's success so far is n't about branding , demographics , or even politics as we 've known it for too long .
It 's about using technology to make democracy work .
The story begins in 2001 , when a political operator named Joe Trippi went to work as an advisor to Progeny , the company headed by Ian Murdock , whose first name is the second half of Debian .
Two years later Joe was running the presidential campaign of Howard Dean , who owed much ( if not nearly all ) of his grass roots support and fund - raising success to smart ( and cheap ) use of the Net -- and lots of open source geekery .
" I always wondered how could you take that same collaboration that occurs in Linux and open source and apply it here , " Joe told Larry Lessig in a 2003 interview .
" What would happen if there were a way to do that and engage everybody in a presidential campaign ? "
When Larry asked Joe if that made Dean 's an open - source campaign , Joe said , " Yes ... I guess it ’s about as open as you can do it in modern - day politics " .
In his own blog , Ian Murdock said of Joe , " Within the first hour of talking with him , Joe understood the open source movement as well as I did and was able to show me things I had n't been able to see even after eight years . "
The first time I met Joe was in a video IM session .
Joe 's face was on the screen of my laptop in California , while my face was on Britt Blaser 's laptop , which he carried around the halls and meeting rooms of the Dean Campaign headquarters in Burlington , Vermont  as if he were a waiter with a talking snack tray .
The tour worked so well that I was already familiar with the layout of the place when I arrived in the dead of Winter and the height of the campaign 's energy : mid-January , 2004 , on the eve of the Iowa Caucuses .
Several memories of that visit stand out for me .
One is of Nicco Mele minding racks of servers and other LAMP - based electronics , and grumbling about what a mess it was dealing with the various state and local party operators , each with their own patched - together tech , which usually qualified more as problems than as " solutions " .
Another is of Zack Rosen , sitting on a box in the corner of a cubicle with three or four other geeks , hacking something in Drupal .
Zack got involved through HackersForDean , which he did with Josh Koenig .
Another is of Dave Winer , working on what he called " a really interesting RSS project to roll out in time for the Iowa caucus results on Monday night . "
Posting that same day ( January 17 ) , Dave added , " I am neutral on the Democratic presidential candidates .
I may have opinions , but in my technical work , they 're simply not relevant .
I believe in politically agnostic tools . "
Looking back , I think what I saw was the equivalent for politics of the Tech Model Railroad Club or the Home Brew Computer Club .
It was where a new and highly practical tech movement started .
Britt Blaser calls it " the first campaign that functioned more like a Web service than a marketing blitz " .
Dean dropped out of the race after losing in Iowa , but neither the techies nor their code were running for office .
Instead the " Dean Diaspora " began the work of improving democracy with free and open technology .
One member of that diaspora was Jascha Franklin - Hodge .
" After I got back to Boston I started reconnecting with some of my friends that I had been ignoring for six months " , Jascha told me .
" And the thing I kept hearing from people was , ' Oh you worked for Howard Dean .
That 's so cool .
I went to a meet - up and a I started volunteering in my local democratic party .
I went up to neighbors and knocked on doors ' .
These were people for whom the experience of being involved was n't just about supporting a candidate .
It was also about finding their own political voice , finding their own civic talent . "
So Jascha got together with three other Dean tech veterans -- Clay A. Johnson , Joe Rospars , and Ben Self -- and started Blue State Digital .
In a June 2008 story , Business Week called Blue State Digital " Obama 's secret political weapon " .
By the end of July Blue State 's work was behind more than $ 200 million raised online , 1,000,000 users and 75,000 campaign events .
By the time you read this , those numbers will be way low .
I became acquainted with Blue State Digital 's work for the Obama campaign on June 3 of this year , when I got an email pointing me to a MyBO ad with the filename " techinterest ? foo " .
The ad recruited " exceptionally talented web developers " with " A deep understanding of LAMP development processes and best practices " , " Experience scaling ( a ) large LAMP application " , " Experience building complex applications using PHP and MySQL " with " deep knowledge of MySQL performance and query optimization " and " Advanced or expert CSS , Javascript , and AJAX skills " .
The email also noted that McCain 's campaign site runs on Windows .
Blue State hardly needed the ad .
As Jascha put it to me , " The work that we do does put us at a huge advantage when shopping for talent .
What we do is bigger for a lot of developers than making software for a bank .
We want geeks to get up and be happy in the morning , and think ' I 'm building something today that millions of people tomorrow are going to use to help change the world ' . "
The Obama Campaign is n't much into " social computing " of the Facebook and MySpace sort .
But it 's outstanding at using computing to make the campaign social in the real world .
When I go to MyBO and look for events within 25 miles of my zipcode near Cambridge , 64 come up .
They include : community organizing meetups , musical performances , speech - watching parties , gatherings at farmers markets and carnivals , fundraisers with notables , church picnics and barbeques , stagings for voter registration walks , carpool caravans , youth organization rallies , school alumni coffees ... the list goes on and on .
All within the next month .
Each event is marked by a little symbol on a Google map .
Above both the list and the map are three buttons : a green KML one for Google Earth , an orange XML one for RSS feed , and a green ICAL one to create calendar files .
To the right of the map is the my .
BarackObama column .
From the top it has My Dashboard , My Neighborhood , Friends , Events , Messages , Groups , Fundraising and My Blog .
The last six are headings to the right of a " + " .
Expand those and you 'll find 18 ways to engage with with other people , the campaign , or both .
And still there is plenty of white space .
The page 's action is fast , smooth , simple and clean .
When I go to the McCain campaign website and look for events within the same 25 miles , 16 come up : 13 are appeals to join phone banks or to volunteer in some other way ; 3 are for parties by individuals on the same " national event day " , and each has the same canned copy .
Of course this is n't fair .
Massachusetts is not only an exceptionally blue state , but home to Blue State Digital as well .
So I just ran the same test for 85018 , a zip code in central Phoenix : the heart of McCain Country .
There I get 23 events for Obama events and 16 for McCain .
Obama 's have the same variety as those around Boston .
McCain 's all seem to be stamped out under personalized headers .
There are 13 parties ( mostly given by individuals ) on the same " national event day " as those in Boston .
Each has the same boilerplate copy .
Three are scheduled for other times .
Two of those involve veterans .
So , how does Blue State do it ?
And how exactly are Linux and open source involved ?
Here 's how Jascha put it to me :
Almost all of our tools put user interaction and user creation first .
Take events management systems .
In the past they were made so an organization could post its official calendar online .
We said that 's great but not nearly as interesting as letting your supporters create their own calendars .
So we created tools where the first priority was to make it easy for somebody coming onto the website to host a house party , or to arrange to pick up litter alongside a highway while wearing t- shirts for their organization : everything from the mundane to the innovative .
We wanted to make it easy to create an event , schedule it , make it searchable , handle RSVPs , and for people to do their own fund - raising .
The two services we use most in the context of events are Google and Yahoo 's mapping and geocoding APIs .
We 'll geocode your address with lon / lat , and use that to place nearby events .
We have lots of databases of other geographical information .
For example , the lon / lat center of a Zip+4 .
Congressional districts for zip codes , census information , census tract , block numbers ...
If you 're just filling out a sign - up form , we do n't require you to put in everything .
If you donate later , we can get your address then if you do n't want to give it at first .
The stack is LAMP : Linux , Apache , MySQL , PHP .
On the back end we use lots of open source libraries and tool kits .
We use YUI , and Ext , which are javascript UI libraries .
One of our developers is the creator of the Horde project , which is a big open source PHP framework .
We do n't like to re-invent wheels .
So , for example , we do n't write our own database connection library .
We 're using ADOdb , which is one of the more popular ones for PHP , and python as well .
We use PEAR , which is PHP 's library of tools and utilities .
We use PEAR modules for everything from sending email to doing caching ...
We use things like memcached .
We use open source monitoring tools .
We use RSS all over the place : events , blogs ... we use it to link parts of our own system internally , say to share information between two different client systems , or between two parts of our system .
Wherever possible we try to build those interface points around accepted standards for interchange .
If they need to be opened up , or if the client wants direct access to them , we say " go ahead and use whatever RSS library you have " .
If we 're working with a tool and add a significant feature to it , or fix a bug , we of course share that with developers and the project .
The front end , however , is all stuff that we 've purpose - built for political and nonprofit organizations -- or anybody that wants to engage membership with a bigger goal in mind .
While the Obama Campaign hogs the spotlight , other Dean - vintage hackers are busy working on something both Obama and McCain have been advocating as senators : transparency and accountability in government .
Greg Elin , a data specialist with the Sunlight Foundation and the family of efforts it supports ( OpenCongress.org , Congresspedia.org , FedSpending.org , OpenSecrets.org , EarmarkWatch.org , LOUISdb.org ... ) :
Almost all of our projects and funded projects are open source -- though sometimes our code is a bit hacked so it takes a while to release it .
Nearly every group I know is completely invested in open source : MySQL , PostgreSQL , Apache ...
The frameworks are being rapidly adopted : Rails , Django , Symfony ...
The work I 'm most interested in these days is dynamic - scripting -- what I think about as " flow - and - go " data sets instead of what Jeff Jonas coined as " rack - and - stack " data sets .
Dynamic scripting is Unix pipes !
That is , every application does input and output .
We leave the world of databases - make - reports and enter the world of RSS - flows - in and RSS - flows - out .
Two examples of flow .
A Sunlight database , LouisDB.com , scrapes the Congressional Daily Record daily , transforming it into XML .
Garrett Schure ( Sunlight Labs developer ) and Josh Ruihley did a word count algorithm on the Congressional Record to come up with Congress ' " Word of the Day " and the microsite http://capitolwords.org
 which goes back to 2001 and has an RSS feed , API , and a widget people can put on their site .
Louisdb.com makes it easier to search the Congressional Record  and now there 's a script boiling it down into tweetable content that others can use , too .
Second example , from MySociety : TheyWorkForYou .
It provides profiles of what Members are doing in Parliament by parsing the Parliament 's daily record and votes .
Lastly , many sites rely on the work of Josh Tauber 's http://govtrack.us b/c. Josh scrapes all sorts of data on bills in Congress and transforms it into XML .
Josh 's data is open and so also is his code .
It 's a tremendous contribution .
And what about Howard Dean ?
Well , in 2005 he became Chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
His old presidential campaign site , DeanForAmerica , morphed smoothly into DemocracyForAmerica , which supports many candidates instead of just one .
Says Jascha , " He took all these people , who in some cases had taken over their local democratic party organizations , and helped them channel that energy and that civic spirit towards electing democratic and progressive candidates around the country .
They 've raised money for people .
They 've gotten the word out , coordinated volunteers .
Here in Boston you had a city councilman , Sam Yoon , who won an at - large city council seat with tremendous support from DFA .
All these people who had been involved with Dean went out and volunteered for Yoon . "
Britt Blaser :
Before Dean , politicians do n't know the Internet was created by makers , not by machers , which is political - speak for powerful deal - makers who rule politics through influence , money and arm - twisting .
The Dean campaign 's Internet staff -- its makers -- was the nucleus of a new class of political experts , focused on means rather than ends .
Like Linux hackers , Dean ’s makers felt and acted more like a guild than partisans , and they similarly related more easily to people outside the campaign than to their bosses .
Since most of them were volunteers , the concept of boss did n't mean a lot to them .
They were seeking collaborators outside the campaign for political purposes , but the tools they built map surprisingly well to governmental purposes , since every issue becomes law after a successful campaign for hearts and minds and money .
Which is all very good .
But is it good enough ?
Of all the interactions I 've had with Dean - vintage veterans , one with Liza Sabater stands out .
Like several others , she lamented the late CivicSpaceLabs ( a creation of Zack Rosen and others ) .
Among other things , it did wonders with Drupal .
" The truth is that there is not one open source project out there that comes closes to the promise of CivicSpaceLabs " , Liza says .
" And that to me is the fundamental difference between the 2004 and the 2008 elections .
For all the talk about Obama 's campaign being netcentric and groundbreaking , the code to their site is still proprietary .
I do n't foresee the Obama campaign releasing that code to make it easier for any and all people to replicate what they have created .
Same thing , by the way , with MoveOn.org , Democracy For America and even the organizing tools created by the DNCC . "
Phil Windley , former CIO for Utah , is n't happy with what he sees from either campaign : " My view from here is that the ' Net is being treated like a big broadcast medium with a built - in cash register " .
Greg Elin puts this uneven progress in perspective :
Programmers and technologists who grew up with the web and with open source have been entering the political and e-government arena the past several years bringing with them the tools and practices of open source and Web 2.0 .
They are collaborating with -- and sometimes competing with -- existing technologists who were often activists who learned spreadsheets and databases and desktop publishing and then the web to communicate their message .
So we are seeing a geek - i- fication of everything from campaigns to good government groups to government itself .
More open source .
More frameworks .
More collaborative communication among individual developers .
It 's uneven , it 's bumpy , but it is definitely happening .
The tipping point has occurred now in politics and government -- the question remains only where the tree is going to land .
Democracy should n't be about candidates and campaigns as products or brands .
Image matters , but it 's still just superficial .
The substance of democracy is what hackers have known for the duration : freedom , liberty , openness , generosity , and constructive responsibility .
The best code does n't just win .
It just works .
We need to keep doing that .
And teaching it too .

NEW YORK , Dec. 2 ( UPI ) -- U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps , who won a record - setting eight Olympic gold medals this year , was selected the 2008 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year .
Phelps , 23 , was involved in seven world records -- some of the performances came as part of relay teams -- in the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing and has collected a record 14 gold medals in his career .

He is the first swimmer to win the honor .
His eight gold medals in one Olympics broke the record set by Mark Spitz in 1972 .
Tennis star Billy Jean King was selected the Sportswoman of the Year over Spitz .
" Michael Phelps as the 2008 Sportsman of the Year was the easiest choice I have made , " said Sports Illustrated Group Editor Terry McDonell in a news release Tuesday .

Positive thinking is an art that can help you manage your life better .
There are ways to learn how to start thinking positive .
Positive thinking is not something that will fall one day from the sky but it needs effort and skills to be able to achieve it .
By thinking positive you will place you self in a position that will allow you not only to manage your life better but it will also help you to raise your self - esteem and self - confidence .
The power of positive thinking
Have you ever wonder that the thoughts that pass through our minds are responsible for everything that happens in our lives ?
What we think is essentially what we live .
The way we think affects our behaviour , our emotions , and our mood ; how we see things , the way we act and react in our environment .
So what is happening in our minds is our life itself !
With the power of positive thinking and as soon as you start thinking positive your self - confidence and self - esteem will improve and everything will seem easier .
The power of the mind is the second strongest tool we have , after the power of the soul , which can in many situations give us even superhuman willingness or superhuman powers ( e.g. in case of danger ) .
Our thoughts have the attribute to pass and be stored in our subconscious , which can affect our behaviour and our reactions .
Our thoughts have also the ability to enter the subconscious of others around us .
The thoughts we share with other people are predisposing them positively or negatively towards us .
They can create feelings of love and respect or feelings of anger .
Our thoughts create action and reaction not only in our mental world but also in the world around us .
Have you ever wonder how can we make radical changes in our lives ?
The change in our lives is possible only when we can control our thinking , to filter the negativism and to show only the positive and beauty contained in our life .
This is the power of our mind !
10 Ways to start thinking positive
1. Start thinking about success
Create in your mind an indelible image of yourself as a successful person .
Keep this strong image within you , and do not even allow it to fade .
Over time , this picture will evolve within you and the details will be stimulated .
You must never challenge the reality of this intellectual image because it will be dangerous .
Your mind will also try to fill the gaps in what was originally imagined .
Always have in your mind the success regardless of how bad things seem to be at the moment .
Each time that invades your mind a negative thought concerning your personal powers and abilities , deliberately start thinking of something very positive to counteract .
2. Bypass your obstacles and fears
Do not build your imagination with obstacles .
Instead , try to minimize any potential problems .
The difficulties must be studied and be treated effectively in order to be eliminated , without giving them more power than they really have .
Fear often exaggerates the difficulties and « hides » their true dimension .
3. Transform your thoughts into images
Think of your brain as a playback unit .
The images are coming from our thoughts , often taking shape in our minds and frighten us , or give us the power to be creative or inspire us or make us dream .
Negative thoughts create negative images and hence negative reactions .
The same happens with positive thoughts that make exactly the opposite and work for our benefit .
To start thinking positive you have to create these positive images in your mind and take advantage of the inspiration and creativity they will create .
4 . Do not get impressed by other people
This is the most important advice .
Do not be impressed by other people and do not try to copy them .
Nobody can be as effective as you in your own life .
Remember also that regardless of how dynamic and successful one can seem , often they may have the same lack of self - confidence and they may be afraid the same as you .
5 . Get to know your self better
Get to know your self better .
Find what is causing your inferiority or your fears and misgivings .
It is likely these negative feelings of you to stem from childhood and from early age .
You may need the advice of a specialist to help you understand why you feel and behave in a particular way .
Try to understand your self better , which is the first step in managing your life better .
6 . Make a realistic assessment of your skills
Make a realistic assessment of your skills and then increase that by 10 % .
That does not mean that you will become selfish .
Instead , you must believe in the forces and means to create a rock solid sense of your self .
Only when you believe in your self you will be able to start thinking positive .
7 . Turn positive thinking into creative thinking
Turn positive thinking into creative thinking .
Positive thinking alone will not help you .
What you need apart from positive thinking is creative thinking .
Creative thinking is about planning , designing and setting goals for the future .
Starting from simple , everyday things you have in your daily schedule .
This can be the first step to organize your thinking on how to implement the things you have to do .
Also the power of creative thinking , besides the benefits it can bring to us , can also be used as a positive influence for those around us .
We can inspire them ; give them incentives , energy and vision .
Thinking creatively is something that we can train ourselves to do .
It takes time and effort but when we achieve it we will be able to manage our life better .
8 . Use your time efficiently
Start transforming thoughts to actions .
Try and find ways to simplify and facilitate your daily obligations , which would result in savings of your valuable time that is needed for your personal improvement .
9 . Solve your everyday problems
Focus to solve some of the operational problems of everyday life and then direct the power of your positive thinking to try and shape the next steps in your live , your personal relations in your career and your family .
10 .
Do not stop dreaming
Dream !
The power of thinking can take you to some great moments that made you happy … it can magically transfer you to the beach as if you were on holiday !
It can transfer to you sounds , colours , smells and people .
Dream now what you would like to be in your life , your relationship , your work and think about it intensely with as many details as you can .
This thought makes you feel beautiful ?
This thought gives you incentive to try to get to the point that you dreamed ?
Yes !
You must do this every day thinking , again and again and again !
So , install a new operating system in your brain that will make you start thinking positive .
This will ignore the fears and will not convert them into images , will ignore the bad thoughts about possible failures and transform them into a big picture of success and self confidence .
You ’ll see that with time your life will become more beautiful and will approach the life that you dreamed about and also your behaviour will become more effective and more acceptable to your environment .
Fight against the evil thoughts from their roots and do not leave them reach the surface .
To start thinking positive is in your hand … or rather in your mind !
And also right .
The harsh reality is that this was not a noble undertaking done for good reasons .
It was a criminal enterprise launched by madmen cheered on by a chorus of fools and cowards .
And it ’s seen as such by virtually everyone all around the world — including but by no means limited to the Arab world .
Right now , there ’s a major effort underway to flush the sheer crazy / vileness of the Bush years — and the cravenness of those who enabled it — down the memory hole .
We should n’t let that effort succeed .
The fact is that an American president deliberately misled the nation into war , probably for political gain — and most of the country ’s elite went cheerfully along with the scam .
Tyra Banks is looking to do for the entire country what she 's done for the model wannabes on her reality show — minus the cramped quarters , petty arguments and questionable eating habits .
The CW has given the greenlight to Operation Fabulous , the first spinoff series for the fiercest show in prime time , set to be produced by Banks herself .
According to the Hollywood Reporter , the new pilot will essentially expand on one of the most popular elements of Top Model — the model makeover episode — and apply its transformative powers to women across the country .
Top Model mentors Jay and J—as in Manuel and Alexander , for the uninitiated — will partner up to host the show and make pit stops in various towns across the country .
Windows 7 is what Windows Vista should have been , what we hoped it would be .
The Batman Begins to Vista 's Batman and Robin .
While superficially both are kinda the same ( Batman ! ) , there 's a completely different thought process at work .
Our walkthrough and videos showed you how the new user experience is something to be excited about ; now we want to show you what it is under the hood that enables the wholly hypeworthy experience to be all it can be .
And why Windows 7 will totally smash Vista 's kidneys .
Microsoft is cheerfully explicit about 7 killing Vista .
At PDC , the head of Windows performance Gabriel Aul laid it out simply in a presentation entitled " Raising the Bar " :
• If an application or device runs on Vista , it should run on Win 7 . •
If a system runs Windows Vista , should run Windows 7 even faster .
•
Notebooks should get better battery life in Windows 7 . • Windows 7 will be more reliable than Vista SP1 from Day 1 .

Yep , not only does it have a more usable UI thanks to snazzy elements like peek through , a whole new taskbar and just common sense simplifications , Microsoft admirably pulls an Apple here — its next release of Windows will run even faster than the previous one , an unprecedented feat for Microsoft .
That 's because it 's a whole lot smarter about taking care of what 's going on in the background while you 're gaping at some new UI element that 's both pretty and useful .
For instance , Vista 's window memory manager devotes the same amount of RAM to every window you have open :
No matter how many windows are open , it acts like every one of them is visible and full screen size , even if you had them minimized or in the background .
This ate up a ton of resources , especially if you 're like us and leave a billion windows open .
Windows 7 's window memory manager does n't do that — only the visible windows use video resources now .
That means you can actually run Windows 7 with 1GB of RAM — unlike Vista , where having anything less than 2GB is totally retardiculous .

Windows 7 is also way more brainy when it comes to crashy apps and errors , in a couple different ways .
Probably the most impressive sounding — though we 'll have to see how well it works in real life — is application crash resiliency .
If an app crashes more than once , Windows 7 learns how it should run the app to avoid that particular train wreck .
Also , error reports are actually useful :
The Problem Steps Recorder watches what you do to trip an error — if you can repeat it after turning on the recorder , that is — and it generates a useful , detailed error report in a language that actually resembles English !
And 7 just plain practices safer sex — device drivers are sandboxed , so nastiness from one cruddy set wo n't infect another .
Having learned its lesson , Microsoft is working with hardware makers to deliver all updated drivers through Windows Update instead of , say , Samsung 's byzantine excuse of a website .
None of Windows 7's awesomeness matters , though , if all that rock is too much for your notebook 's battery to handle .
Vista 's power management was definitely better than XP's , and Windows 7's is remarkably better still .
Part of it is just that whole smarter background management , which for battery life does things like dial down the processor more often , use less juice to play a standard def DVD , automatically turn off your Ethernet adapter , common sense stuff like that .
But it does n't just do all this fancy energy - saving jujitsu behind your back ( though it can ) .
Windows 7 is capable of delivering a battery efficiency report that breaks down in detail what 's chomping on your battery — power - slurping hardware , vampire -y processes , the works .
All of this reflects a new mindset about the overall user experience that seems like it just got left on Vista 's cutting room floor , for whatever reason .
Vista was just going through the motions of a new OS .
If Microsoft actually delivers on what they 've shown and are promising for Windows 7 — and all signs seem to point that way — it'll actually have the heart and soul of one , even if it 's wearing the same brand of clothes .

The deep sea is full of surprises , and the four - eyed spookfish is up there with the best of them .
It is the first vertebrate found with eyes that use mirrors , rather than a lens , to focus light .
In clear water , sunlight can penetrate to a depth of 1000 metres , so some deep - sea fish have developed tubular , upward - looking eyes .
“ It is like having a telescope on your head that points towards the surface , ” says Ron Douglas from City University London .
However , sunlight is only part of the story .
The most important source of light at that depth is other creatures , as 80 % emit their own light , called bioluminescence .
The unusual spookfish was caught in the deep waters between Samoa and New Zealand , but no one on the research boat knew what it was .
“ It caught my attention because it looked like it had four eyes , and vertebrates with four eyes do n’t exist , ” says Douglas .

It turns out that the spookfish ( Dolichopteryx longipes ) actually has just two eyes , but each eye has two parts , one looking upwards and the other down .
Getting reflective
The team found that the part looking down uses thousands of tiny reflective crystals – acting like mirrors – that are angled in slightly different directions to focus light onto the retina .
This is completely different to a typical fish eye , which uses a single lens to bend light onto a focal point , similar to the way the human eye works .
Other tubular - eyed fish do use optical techniques to look sideways and downwards but these mechanisms have no way to focus light into a clear image .
The spookfish is the only deep - sea fish with eyes that have been shown to produce a focused image when looking both up and down .
“ This is the first demonstration that vertebrates are not as optically boring as we thought , ” says Douglas .
Mike Land from the University of Sussex , UK , thinks the eye is “ intriguing ” and could be unique to the spookfish .
“ I doubt we ’ll see this in other vertebrates – surely we would have discovered it by now . ”

Scalia criticizes courts citing foreign trends Scalia : Foreign law is n't ours
At Houston gala , he criticizes courts that cite countries ' trends for rulings

Judges who use foreign laws to interpret the U.S. Constitution are rewriting it rather than respecting its founders , U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia told a roomful of judges and top lawyers in Houston on Monday night .
" I fear the courts ' use of foreign law in interpreting the Constitution will continue at an accelerated pace , " the 72 - year - old conservative jurist said .
Scalia spoke at a $ 150 - a- head steak and potatoes dinner sponsored by the local chapter of the Federal Bar Association and held at the Hyatt Regency Houston downtown .
Before talking for about 30 minutes , the jurist autographed copies of a book he co-authored .
Scalia promised to be noncontroversial but frequently used the example of Lawrence v. Texas , a Houston case in which he disagreed with the majority that struck down Texas ' anti-sodomy law .
Scalia complained that foreign laws were cited in that case .
Scalia was typically evangelical in his advocacy of " originalism , " or strictly adhering to what the Constitutional authors meant more than 200 years ago .
He criticized those who see the Constitution as an evolving or " living document " that adapts to the times .
The 1986 Reagan appointee said he 'll only become a believer in those who cite foreign law if they do it more universally , like in abortion cases where more countries prohibit it than do n't .
" The court has ignored foreign law in its abortion cases , " he said .
Scalia said the founders of this country did not want us to emulate Europe .
He told the 50 tables of lawyers that when judges use foreign laws or even U.S. legislative history , they are straying from their true purpose .
He said judges do it to expand their own power because they wrongly consider " the views of all segments of mankind " and to make it appear they have something to rely upon .
Scalia said some leeway can be found even sticking only with the Constitutional text .
" It does n't mean you ca n't twist the Constitution , " he said lightly .
" You just do it the good old - fashioned way : You just lie about it . "
The self - proclaimed social conservative , known for both his combativeness and his humor , Scalia spoke in Houston in part to promote his book Making Your Case : The Art of Persuading Judges .
It 's written with Bryan Garner , a Dallas - based legal writing author .
The book 's acknowledgments include a thanks to Houston - based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Edith Jones , who introduced Scalia on Monday night .
In response to a question from Jones , Scalia said he disagrees with his alma mater Harvard Law School 's decision to copy Yale and scrap grades in favor of a pass / fail system .
" I want to know who 's best in the class .
I do n't want to know just who went to Yale , " he said .
In response to another question , the jurist said he thinks law schools have gotten away from teaching students to be lawyers , and some academics have even developed a contempt for the practice .
He argued legal academics should spend more time with legal practitioners .

Because of the late unpleasantness , there ’s been a lot of debate among a certain kind of Leftist as to what attitude the Left ought to take towards the Democratic Party ’s big win at the polls , and the grassroots efforts by eager young Obamarchists to help bring it about .
In the name of critical support , many state Leftists — particularly those who fancy themselves Progressives — urge other Leftists to hop on board the Democratic Party train ; those who are a bit more skeptical , point out that , for people seriously concerned with peace , civil liberties , labor radicalism , anti-racism , ending bail - out capitalism , and so on , an Obama Presidency is an extremely limited victory at best , and those who know a bit of history point out that the Democratic Party has been the graveyard of social movements for over a century now , with one movement after another being diverted from grassroots action on behalf of their primary goals into the secondary or tertiary goals of bureaucratic maneuvering , party politicking , canvassing , fund - raising , or shamelessly apologizing for Democratic Party politicians .
And once they go in , movements more or less never come out .
Perhaps not surprisingly , given the current economic crisis , in discussions like these a lot of electoralist Progressives very quickly dig up the decaying corpse of Franklin Roosevelt , apparently in order to demonstrate a case where so - called critical support from the Left worked — that is , it supposedly worked because it supposedly got us the New Deal , and the New Deal supposedly represents a series of victories that Leftists should feel good about .
The problem is that this picture is false in just about every detail .
The New Deal was achieved in spite of the grassroots efforts of the American Left , not because of them .
It was , in fact , put through largely as a means to co-opt or stifle the American Left .
And what was put through ought to be considered a travesty by anyone for whom economic Leftism is supposed to mean an increase in workers ’ power to control the conditions of their own lives and labor , rather than an increase in government ’s power to make businessmen do what politicians want them to do .
So here is a brief history , contributed by a member of the Movement for a Democratic Society listserv ( in response to a series of uncritical critical support apologetics and name - drops to Roosevelt ) , of the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the friend of labor and patron saint of the American Progressive Left .

Oct. 1933 , 4 strikers killed in Pixley Ca. textile strike .
Early 1934 , Roosevelt intervenes in the auto industry on behalf of company unions as opposed to worker organized unions .
In 1934 , General Strikes in Toledo , San Francisco and Minneapolis began to threaten the capitalist order .
IN 1935 , the Wagner Act was passed to regularize labor relations .
The NLRB was set up to mediate between labor and capital ending the surge of general strikes .
In 1936 - 7 , workers began to use the sit down strike to great advantage .
In 1937 , the Roosevelt appointed National Labor Relations Board declared them to be illegal .
Later the Supreme Court in 1939 , dominated by pro-Roosevelt judges , declared sit - down strikes to be illegal , taking the wind out of the sails of the labor movement .
When labor leaders tried to gain Roosevelt ’s support in critiquing the killing of 18 peaceful workers in the steel strikes of ’ 37 , Roosevelt refused , thus condoning the killings .
IN 1938 and 39 with rising unemployment , Roosevelt cut programs for the poor and unemployed .
The passing of the Social Security Act institutionalized the incredibly regressive payroll tax while postponing and benefits and establishing a retirement age beyond the life expectancy of workers so that payments would be minimal .
Additionally , most women and Afro-Americans were purposefully not covered by the Act .
At the time it was established the NAACP protested the racism inherent in the exclusions of most job categories employing blacks .
The original act was also blamed for contributing to the economic downturn of 1937 because the government collected taxes from workers but paid no benefits to workers during this time period .
Initially , no benefits whatsoever were to be paid until at least 1942 .
Amendments in 1939 changed that to 1940 but only encompassed a tiny minority .
Friend of Labor Roosevelt in 1940 signed the Smith Act which had been proposed by a Democrat and passed by a Democratic Congress .
The first prosecutions were ordered by Roosevelt ’s Attorney General Francis Biddle .
Unfortunately , the split between the orthodox communists and the Trotskyists resulted in the persecution of the Trotskyists .
When the Federal Theater Project planned a musical production in 1937 attacking corporate greed , Roosevelt shut it down .
He then had the theatre padlocked and surrounded by armed soldiers .
So much for the concept of political space under the Democrats .
One mistake rather consistently made by a good chunk of progressives is to frame an analysis based on the paranoia of the extreme right wing , taking their statements as if they were facts .
So if Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh and their ilk criticize some facet of American life or history ( for example FDR as being some sort of left enabler ) , the progressives then want to disagree completely with Hannity et al and thus accept whatever BS he put forward but take the opposite point of view on it .
So we then have progressives defending Roosevelt ’s supposed progressive leanings or opening political space for the left or whatever phrasing suits their purposes .
It ’s not helpful to let the extreme right thereby define the nature of political discourse .
It leads to an incredibly false and warped view of society and history .
Rather than helping to create an opening for the left in the 1930s , Roosevelt did what he could to shut off all openings that had been created by the workers themselves .
He ended the surge of general strikes , then he ended the surge of sit down strikes .
He put a stop to progressive artists .
Clamped down on the radicals of the time period .
Condoned the police and national guard killing of protesting workers .
Collected regressive taxes from workers while promising them pension benefits at a point in the future for those fortunate enough to survive their employment and avoid an early death ..
He continued racist and sexist policies especially relating to employment , government sanctioned discrimination and unfair dispersal of social benefits .
The main thing I would want to add to the analysis is that , unfortunately , I do n’t think that the veneration of St. Franklin is solely due to the rush to take an equal - but - opposite reaction to the vilification of Roosevelt by plutocratic Right - wing hacks like Limbaugh or Hannity .
The attitude is much older than Right - wing hate radio , and I think it is deeply rooted in the historical narratives and the self - conception of the Progressive wing of the Left .
At the time Roosevelt went on a full - bore attack against the radical Left but enjoyed the support of the professional - class Progressive Left — whose influence he dramatically increased , and whose fortunes he subsidized on the taxpayer ’s dime , with his massive expansion of the civil service and government planning bureaucracy .
And he is venerated today by so many on the Left because so many on the Left continue allow their message to be set by the agendas of the political parties and by the nostrums of mid-20th century vital center corporate liberal politics .
The counter - historical hagiography is n’t just a way of reacting to the Right ; it ’s also a way that the Establishmentarian Left keeps the radical Left in line , diverts all too many of us into the failed strategy of increasing workers ’ power by increasing government power , and blinds all too many to the fact that their efforts within or on behalf of the Democratic Party are failing repeatedly , or when they succeed , inevitably succeed in increasing the power of professional government planners , without any significant gains for ordinary workers .
So it is really refreshing , at this historical moment , to see some folks challenging St. Franklin from the Left .
And it ’s deeply unfortunate , but not surprising , that it is refreshing to see that .
It ought to be easy and common to make the Leftist case against a millionaire dynastic politician who officially kicked off his administration with a series of massive bank bail - outs , systematically attacked labor radicals , created a bureaucratic apparatus intended to buy off and domesticate labor moderates and conservatives , while sidelining or criminalizing labor ’s most effective tactics , and presided over repeated physical attacks on organized workers .
A millionaire dynastic politician who , in 1936 , ordered J. Edgar Hoover to ramp up federal surveillance of questionable domestic political groups , and who aggressively dispensed with traditional restraints on unilateral executive power in order to pack the courts in favor of his own policies and to elevate himself to President - for - Life .
A President - for - Life who conscripted millions of workers in the United States ’ first ever peacetime military draft , who then spent a couple years deliberately wangling his way into a position where he could throw his new conscript army into the largest and most destructive war in the history of the world , who then , using the exigencies of a global war on tyranny as his excuse , drove Congress to create the House Un- American Activities Committee , imprisoned war protesters and political opponents on sedition and espionage charges , extracted no - strike agreements from the now - politically - controlled labor unions , commandeered virtually every good and imposed massive rationing and government - mandated wage freezes on American workers , created the modern military - industrial complex , ordered the firebombing of hundreds of German and Japanese cities , and , with a series of unilateral executive orders and military proclamations , summarily seized the property of hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans , imposed arbitrary curfews on them based solely on their nationality , and finally sent in the military to roust them out of their homes and march them into concentration camps scattered across the American West .
Unfortunately , that kind of talk does n’t square with the preferred historical narrative of Democratic Party politicians , and ( therefore ) it does n’t much suit those who have ambitions that depend on currying favor with Democratic Party politicians .
So it ’s not the sort of thing that you hear much about .
But it is the sort of thing that we can remember , and that we can talk about , whether they want us to or not .

SEC Sues National Lampoon , Inc. and Others for Wide - Ranging Market Manipulation Schemes
Daniel S. Laikin , National Lampoon 's CEO , Charged with Paying Kickbacks in Exchange for Manipulating the Market for National Lampoon 's Stock
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that today it charged seven individuals and two corporations with engaging in three separate fraudulent schemes to manipulate the market for publicly traded securities through the payment of prearranged kickbacks .
The defendants include National Lampoon , Inc. and its CEO , Daniel S. Laikin , as well as stock promoters , a consultant , and an officer of another company .
The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today separately announced criminal charges involving the same conduct .
The Commission 's actions , filed in federal district court in Philadelphia , allege that , in each case , individuals who controlled the stock of a public company arranged with corrupt promoters and others to generate purchases of the company 's stock in exchange for cash kickbacks .
In each case , a witness secretly cooperating with the government ( the " CW " ) was paid a kickback to make purchases in the stock .
The goal of the manipulators was to create the appearance of market interest , induce public purchases of the stock , and ultimately increase the stock 's trading price .
For example , the Commission alleges that Daniel Laikin and another defendant paid at least $ 68,000 in cash kickbacks for the purchase of National Lampoon stock in order to artificially inflate the stock price .
The Commission 's complaints allege as follows :
SEC v. National Lampoon , Inc. et al .
Defendants : National Lampoon , Inc. , headquartered in Los Angeles , California , is a media and entertainment company that develops , produces and distributes media projects including feature films , television programming , online and interactive entertainment , home video , and book publishing .
The company produced such widely known films as National Lampoon 's Animal House , and the National Lampoon Vacation series .
National Lampoon 's common stock is registered with the Commission and is listed on the NYSE Alternext , formerly the American Stock Exchange ( " AMEX " ) .
Daniel S. Laikin , of Los Angeles , California , has been the Chief Executive Officer of National Lampoon since 2005 .
Laikin controls approximately 40 percent of the voting stock of National Lampoon .
Dennis S. Barsky , of Las Vegas , Nevada , is a consultant to National Lampoon , and a significant stockholder .
Eduardo Rodriguez , of Livingston , New Jersey , is a stock promoter .
Tim Dougherty , of Webster , New York , is a stock promoter and principal of OTC Advisors , Inc. , a stock promotion company .
The Commission 's complaint alleges that , from at least March 2008 through June 2008 , Laikin , Barsky , Rodriguez and Dougherty engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of National Lampoon .
Specifically , Laikin , along with Barsky , paid kickbacks in exchange for generating or causing purchases of National Lampoon stock to Rodriguez , a corrupt stock promoter , and the CW , whom Laikin , Barsky and Rodriguez believed had connections to corrupt registered representatives .
As part of this scheme , Dougherty generated purchases of National Lampoon stock in exchange for a portion of the kickbacks .
Dougherty made his purchases over the course of a number of days and used various accounts to give the false impression of a steady demand for the stock .
The complaint alleges that Laikin and Barsky paid at least $ 68,000 that went to Rodriguez , Dougherty , and the CW to cause the purchase of at least 87,500 shares of National Lampoon stock .
Through these efforts , Laikin and Barsky sought to artificially push National Lampoon 's stock price from under $ 2 per share to at least $ 5 per share , in part , to keep the company 's stock price above the minimum listing requirements of the AMEX , and to increase National Lampoon 's ability to enter into possible " strategic partnerships " and acquisitions .
In addition to paying others to purchase the stock , Laikin shared confidential financial information regarding National Lampoon , non-public news releases , and confidential shareholder lists , and coordinated the release of news with the illegal purchases in the stock .
Barsky helped direct the purchases and facilitated the kickback payments .
National Lampoon and Laikin also made materially misleading statements in a tender offer .
The complaint alleges violations of Section 17 ( a ) of the Securities Act of 1933 , Sections 9 ( a ) ( 2 ) , 10 ( b ) and 13(e ) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10 b - 5 and 13e - 4 thereunder .
The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against all defendants , disgorgement of ill - gotten gains , together with prejudgment interest , and civil penalties , from the individual defendants , and an officer and director bar against Laikin .
SEC v. Advatech Corporation , et al .
Defendant Advatech Corporation is headquartered in West Palm Beach , Florida .
It describes itself as an early stage biotechnology company engaged in research and development for the commercialization of products for non-invasive therapeutic medicine .
Advatech 's securities trade on the grey market .
Grey market stocks have no market makers , and are not listed , traded or quoted on any stock exchange , or the over - the - counter bulletin board .
However , customers may trade through brokers on an unsolicited basis , and trading data is publicly available throughout the trading day .
Defendant Richard J. Margulies , of Edison , New Jersey , is Advatech 's Chief Financial Officer and a member of its board of directors .
Margulies owns and / or controls a significant portion of Advatech stock either directly or through nominees .
The Commission 's complaint alleges that , from at least May 2008 through June 2008 , Margulies engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for Advatech 's common stock .
In furtherance of the scheme , Margulies arranged to pay a 20 percent kickback to Rodriguez and the CW for purchases of Advatech stock .
Before Rodriguez and the CW made the illegal purchases , Margulies provided them with shareholder lists , confidential information about the company , and non-public press releases .
Margulies coordinated the release of news with the purchases , said that he wanted to increase Advatech 's stock price from approximately $ 0.30 to $ 2.00 per share , and instructed Rodriguez and the CW that they should " move [ the stock ] up nice and slow , so it does n't look like we 're a bunch of idiots . "
The complaint alleges that , to effectuate his scheme , Margulies paid at least $ 1,040 in kickbacks as partial payments to the CW in exchange for purchases of at least 5,000 shares of Advatech stock on June 17 and 18 , 2008 .
The complaint alleges violations of Section 10 ( b ) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10 b - 5 thereunder .
The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Advatech and Margulies , and disgorgement of ill - gotten gains , together with prejudgment interest , civil penalties , and a penny stock bar against Margulies .
SEC v. Alex Kanakaris , et al .
Defendants Alex Kanakaris , of Newport Beach , California , and Richard Epstein , of Parkland , Florida , are stock promoters who are significant investors in the stock of SwedishVegas , Inc. , headquartered in Arcadia , California , whose stated business plan is to " launch a series of themed eateries with an extensive beer and wine menu and reasonably priced lunches , dinners and appetizers . "
Until July 23 , 2008 , when the Commission suspended trading in its stock , SwedishVegas common stock was quoted on an inter - dealer electronic quotation and trading system in the over - the - counter securities market which is operated by Pink OTC Markets , Inc. , commonly known as the " Pink Sheets . "
The Commission 's complaint alleges that , from at least June through July 2008 , Kanakaris and Epstein engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for the common stock of SwedishVegas .
Specifically , the defendants paid a kickback to Rodriguez , a corrupt stock promoter , and the CW , whom they believed had connections to corrupt stockbrokers , to buy Swedish Vegas stock in an effort to create the appearance of market interest , induce public purchases of stock , and ultimately increase the stock 's trading price .
At one point , Kanakaris told Rodriguez and the CW that he wanted them to buy as much stock as possible in order to make the stock price " fly . "
The complaint further alleges that , in accordance with their scheme , Kanakaris and Epstein paid at least $ 15,000 to Rodriguez and the CW in exchange for completed purchases of at least 125,000 shares of SwedishVegas stock on July 22 , 2008 .
After this initial stock purchase , actually made with FBI funds , the Commission suspended trading in the stock .
The complaint alleges violations of Section 10 ( b ) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10 b - 5 thereunder .
The complaint seeks permanent injunctions , disgorgement of ill - gotten gains , together with prejudgment interest , civil penalties , and penny stock bars from the defendants .
In addition to the enforcement actions , the Commission today entered an order suspending trading in the securities of National Lampoon , Inc. and Advatech Corporation for a ten day period commencing 9:30 a.m. December 15 , 2008 .
The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .

By Jeff Huber
William S. Lind , co-creator of the Fourth Generation Warfare concept and director of the Center for Cultural Conservatism , says a lot of smart things about national security , but he does n’t say any of them about the issue of gays and women in the military .
My admittedly limited experience of the gay lifestyle has n’t endeared me to it : my older male dog humps my younger male dog , my younger male dog humps my leg , and I pay all the bills ; an arrangement , come to think of it , not so different from my experience of marriage .
So I do n’t , so to speak , have a dog in the fight over whether gays or women should be “ allowed ” to serve in the military , but Lind makes such a cock and bull argument against it I feel obliged to apologize on behalf of the entire heterosexual male community .
In a pair of recent opinion pieces , Lind asserts that we should n’t let women and gays in the armed services because if we do , “ men who want to prove they are real men will not join . ”
Lind ’s relative manliness does n’t necessarily add to or subtract from his opinion ’s validity , but unnamed sources who knew him when assure me that the closest he ever came to wearing a uniform was dressing his G.I .
Joe doll in one .
Gays and Dolls
As one might expect a social conservative to do , Lind laces his positions with a number of intellectual subterfuges , not the least of which is filing gay men and women in the same pigeon hole .
The go - to argument against women serving in the military is that they are , on average , smaller and weaker than their male counterparts and they can get pregnant , a consideration that does n’t apply to gay men .
If you think that gay men are intrinsically less physically capable than their heterosexual counterparts , and you want to take a trip to the emergency room , I invite you to walk up to a homosexual member of the American Ballet Theater and call him a faggot .
I doubt if there ’s a segment of the population more physically prepared for direct placement into elite commando training than male dancers .
( There are such things as heterosexual male dancers , by the way , and they generally do n’t lack for the companionship of women who would n’t give either Lind or me the time of day ) .
But there ’s more required of a fighter than physical toughness , according to Lind .
“ Throughout history , ” he prates , “ some armies have fought a lot harder than others .
The specific reasons vary widely , but one way or another they all come down to human factors . ”
The most important human factor , Lind assures us , “ is that men fight to prove they are real men . ”
Their membership in fighting organizations is a “ badge of honor ” that says , “ We ’re not sissies or pansies .
We are men who fight , serving alongside other men who fight . ”
An infusion of sissies and pansies among the company of real men , Lind warns , could damage “ military unit cohesion . ”
Mr. Lind has a selective sense of military history and / or a blind notch in his Doppler gay - dar .
As a carrier skipper I served with said when President Bill Clinton enacted the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy , “ Sailors have been rubbing heinies since Sinbad reported to boot camp . ”
Soldiers have been sharing pup tents just as long .
The ancient Greeks believed that physical love between soldiers improved morale , bravery and overall battle efficiency .
Plato , the philosophical father of the American political right , considered it utter stupidity to ban physical relationships between soldiers .
“ Wherever , therefore , it has been established that it is shameful to be involved in sexual relationships with men , ” he wrote , “ this is due to evil on the part of the rulers , and to cowardice in the part of the governed . ”
In a song honoring the Lelantine War , Plato ’s pupil Aristotle wrote that , “ love…thrives side by side with courage . ”
The Roman historian Plutarch noted that tribal ties were of little value “ when dangers press , but a band cemented by friendship grounded upon love is never to be broken . ”
Lind cautions that gay and straight men ca n’t mix in “ very close quarters ” without “ serous friction . ”
I ’ve got news for Lind : gay and straight men have been mixing in very close quarters in the American military without serious friction since forever , including those World War II John Wayne types that conservatives like Lind have such a school girl crush on .
They ’re queer , Bill .
They ’re here , Bill .
Now drop and give me fifty pushups ( heh ) .
G.I. Jane
The notion of women serving in the military is hardly new either .
Plato favored it .
He wrote in Republic that women must be taught the “ art of war , which they must practice like men . ”
“ Is she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men , or not at all ? ” he asked .
“ And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share ? ”
Then “ let [ women ] share in the toils of war and the defense of their country …
Only in the distribution of labors the lighter are to be assigned to the women , who are the weaker natures , but in other respects their duties are to be the same . ”
Lind ’s specific objection to letting women serve is that they might be allowed into “ ground combat arms . ”
I ’m not sure what he means by that .
Women are and will be assigned to war zones in combat support capacities .
So what ?
He may suppose that women inherently lack the “ right stuff ” for combat , but those Israeli Security Force babes who pull the trigger on those remote control machine guns along the Gaza Strip do n’t appear to be lacking anything in the killer instinct department .
If Lind is worried that women will elbow their way into Delta Force , he is , in Plato ’s words , “ plucking a fruit of unripe wisdom . ”
I do n’t know of anyone who is seriously trying to make women into commandos , or of anyone who would take the notion seriously .
Maybe Lind is confusing that movie where Demi Moore becomes a Navy SEAL with reality .
Confusion about reality is , after all , a leading occupational hazard of conservatism .
I do n’t claim that integrating women in the military has been a tribulation - free experience .
In my day , the incidence of young single sailor girls getting themselves pregnant to get out of duties they did n’t care for was completely out of hand .
We developed a pretty good solution though ; all the single mommy strikers got discharged and sent home .
I ’ve also known a fair number of female officers who benefitted from reverse discrimination , but not nearly as many as the number of male officers I knew who got where they got thanks to Uncle Admiral or Governor Grandpa or a godfather who had a village in the old country named after him .
And never forget that whatever wartime leadership qualities George S. Patton possessed that allowed him to get away with his vainglorious shenanigans , he was also one of the richest dudes in the Army .
Lind ’s bottom line is n’t that women and homosexuals serving in the military will impair America ’s war making capability .
He ’s concerned about “ cultural Marxism , ” which is a code phrase narrow shouldered white male bigots intone when they sense that cultural Darwinism is about to bust them another pay grade or two down the social pyramid .
By Lind ’s criteria , emancipation was cultural Marxism , as was the ban on feeding Christians to lions .
There may be good arguments for barring women and gays from military service , but Lind does n’t make them , and I have n’t heard any that make an ounce more sense than his do .

CHENNAI : The first IIT alumni impact study has outlined the contribution made by IITians for economic value addition , job creation and managing huge budgets over the past 50 years in India and abroad .
Contrary to common perception that IITians take more than they give to the society , the study highlighted the economic impact created by them in terms of wealth creation , social transformation .
The impact study looked at how to enhance the contribution made by IITians , on an individual and collective basis .
The study pointed that over the past 50 years , IIT alumni was involved in the creation of two crore jobs .
They hold senior positions across industries and governments with budgetary responsibility for over Rs 40 lakh crore ( $ 885 bn ) .
They are associated with incremental economic value creation of Rs 20 lakh crore ( $ 450 bn ) .
The study , conducted by PanIIT , an organisation of all the seven IITs , in partnership with the India Brand Equity Fund ( IBEF ) and Zinnov Management Consulting , was a part of the PanIIT 2008 event , the first IIT alumni global conference , which will be held at IIT - Madras between December 19 and 21 .
Over 3,000 IIT alumni and 200 delegates would converge for the big event , which will discuss solutions in areas such as renewable energy , education and infrastructure .
PanIIT is an umbrella organisation of the seven IITs in India .
��
�The question often asked is if the government is spending money on the elitist institution .
But this is needed to create leadership .
The new IITs , which are going to be created in India , are important in this respect , ��� said B Santhanam , chairman of PanIIT 2008 and managing director of SaintGobain Glass India .
IITians also referred to the ET500 list , wherein , 54 % of the top 500 Indian companies currently have at least one IIT alumnus on their boards and these companies have a cumulative revenue that is 10 times higher than other companies on the list .
Over 50 % of IITians work in India and a major chunk of them came back post liberalisation - era .
Because , traditionally , the IITs have been accused of stoking brain drain , using up government funds in the process .
Rajan Srikanth , CMD of S2k2 advisory , said that a soon - to - be - launched venture capital company based in Chennai said it had mapped the impact of IITians on the global economy across areas like entrepreneurship , science and technology ,
research , education , professional management , industry leadership etc .
�� �Each IITian has created 100 jobs .
This is mind - boggling , ��� he said .
Santhanam said , contrary to the feeling that IITians caused brain drain , every Rs 1 invested on an IITian has created an economic impact of Rs 50 at the global level .
Of this , India���s share will be Rs 25 .��� he added .
�� �One in 10 IIT alumni have started their own companies , with over 40 % of them being serial entrepreneurs .
Two - thirds of the companies founded are in India .
In the last 15 - 20 years , most of them have preferred to start up in India , ��� said Zinnov Management Consulting co-founder and CEO Pari Natarajan .
Of IIT alumni , who graduated prior to 2001 , four out of 10 are in top - leadership roles in corporations , educational institutions , research labs , NGOs , government agencies , politics and as entrepreneurial heads of their own companies .
The terrorists themselves offered little explanation , and made no clear demands .
Yet even as the siege continued , commentators were making chilling deductions on their behalf : their actions were because of American foreign policy , or Afghanistan , or the harassment of Indian Muslims .
Personal moral responsibility was removed from the players in the atrocity .
When officials said that the killers came from the Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar - e - Taiba , it was taken as proof that India ’s misdeeds in the Kashmir Valley were the cause .
These misdeeds are real , as are India ’s other social and political failings ( I recently met a Kashmiri man whose father and sister had died at the hands of the Indian security forces ) .
But there is no sane reason to think Lashkar - e - Taiba would shut down if the situation in Kashmir improved .
Its literature is much concerned with establishing a caliphate in Central Asia , and murdering those who insult the Prophet .
Its leader , Hafiz Saeed , who lives on a large estate outside Lahore bought with Saudi Money , goes about his business with minimal interference from the Pakistani government .
Lashkar - e- Taiba is part of the International Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders ( the Qaeda franchise ) .
Mr. Saeed ’s hatreds are catholic  his bugbears include Hindus , Shiites and women who wear bikinis .
He regards democracy as “ a Jewish and Christian import from Europe , ” and considers suicide attacks to be in accordance with Islam .
He has a wider strategy : “ At this time our contest is Kashmir .
Let ’s see when the time comes .
Our struggle with the Jews is always there . ”
As he told his followers in Karachi at a rally in 2000 : “ There ca n’t be any peace while India remains intact .
Cut them , cut them  cut them so much that they kneel before you and ask for mercy . ”
In short , he has an explicit political desire to create a state of war between the religious communities in India and beyond , and bring on the endgame .
Like other exponents of Islamist extremism , he has a view of the world that does not tolerate doubt or ambiguity : his opponents are guilty , and must be killed .
I have met other radicals like Mr. Saeed , men who live in a dimension of absolute certainty and have contempt for the moral relativism of those who seek to excuse them .
To achieve their ends , it is necessary to indoctrinate boys in the hatred of Hindus , Americans and Jews , and dispatch them on suicide missions .
It is unlikely that any of the militants who were sent from Karachi to Mumbai  young men from poor rural backgrounds whose families were paid for their sacrifice  had ever met a Jew before they tortured and killed Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife , Rivka , who was several months pregnant , at the Mumbai Jewish center .
America ’s so - called war on terror has been , in many respects , a catastrophe .
In Pakistan , it has been chronically mishandled , leading to the radicalization of areas in the north that were previously peaceful .
Yet links between the military , the intelligence services and the jihadis have remained intact : Lashkar - e - Taiba is merely one of a number of extremist organizations that continues to function .
What can I tell you about going to work on a weed farm that the Grower , The Trimmers and The Landowner wo n’t kill me for ?
Soft criminals are especially tense about getting put in cages by men with guns … .

In 1996 Californians passed a Proposition called 215 that allowed a citizen to go to a doctor to get certified as demented enough that a federally banned vegetable substance known as a “ Joint ” is the only remedy .
The Doctor gets a hundred dollars .
The Citizen gets a number , a little patch , and if things go a certain way during the Bush Obama changeover , a free ride to a Special Federal Camp .
The distinction between State ’s Rights and Federal Law has led to some lively debates , most notably “ The War of Northern Aggression ” ( 1861 - 1865 ) , after which it was deemed that , in spite of the Constitution , Feds make the Laws and States shut up .
So sorry California , weed is still illegal in the US .
This has created a situation where Growers , thinking they can cultivate legal weed behind their Prop 215 permission slip , get robbed by Federal Agents .
The Grower ca n’t call the Sheriff , and the number at the UN is always busy .
If the production of weed were legal , trimming weed in Humboldt would be a lot like the seasonal job of stomping wine in France .
It is not legal , so trimming weed in Humboldt is like cooking meth in Kentucky .
What can I tell you about going to work on a weed farm that the Grower , The Trimmers and The Landowner wo n’t kill me for ?
Soft criminals are especially tense about getting put in cages by men with guns .
For the sake of this story I will posit that every Grower is , due to certain skill sets and predilections , essentially the same kind of guy .
All Growers have three shitty houses but do n’t live anywhere in particular ; all Growers are trigger hippies who learned to drink in the Army and do n’t like to have a boss ; all Growers have a truck , a dog and an ex-girlfriend with an axe to grind ; etc .
I do n’t know if crime makes cliches come true or if it ’s the other way around , but I would guess that a variation of the following drama is acted out in remote camps across Humboldt every year at harvest time .
The first nights at the camp were the loudest nights .
It was rumored that a Mexican gang was pistol whipping and robbing growers around the valley .
So the neighbors would let off a shot , and we ’d follow suit , letting the theoretical Mexican gang know that the whole mountain stood in a steady state of readiness or madness .
It had yet to dawn on me what was fishy about the Mexican gang rumor because after a day of cop watch reports and terrible music on radio station KMUD , my brain was washed of all sense .
I was ready to believe anything .
The main camp consisted of a reclaimed meth trailer , an outdoor kitchen and a drying shack made of some found wood : exactly the same as one of those tobacco shanties you see slouching haphazardly around the South , except it reeks of skunk .
Outside the drying shack was the kitchen : a freestanding gas jet normally used to fry turkeys , a Coleman two burner camping stove and a gas grill , all covered by an elegant tarp roof .
The living room was comprised of several wonky chairs arranged in front of a fire pit cut into the road leading down to the green house .
I considered myself lucky to be passing a bottle around out in the woods while the stars skated around the sky .
The dirt road out in the middle of nowhere was easy street compared to the economic uncertainty of the real world down valley .
The Grower sang “ All we are say - ing / is stay on your land ” to the tune of “ Give Peace a Chance ” while merrily blasting a fresh faced pumpkin away with his service .45 .
The Jack o Lantern ’s bright eyes and toothy grin provided almost a half an hour of joy before his brief candle was snuffed .
I let the tragedy ride as I was outgunned and , judging from the Grower ’s marksmanship , underserved .
In the course of an evening the simmer of pistols graduated into salvos of “ deer rifles ” gilded with small arm glissades until the show of force spent itself leaving only a lonely nine pop-popping out an echo in the valley below .
The percussion movement was in a magnum key and provided great comfort to all Growers within earshot , but it like totally freaked out the hippy masseuse / trimmers and their fat vegetarian mutts .
The Grower had set up a three - season R.E.I. tent in which I was to sleep and guard the fortune flowering in the lower greenhouse despite all the best efforts of voles , the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting ( CAMP ) , the Department of Justice , the California Highway Patrol , the California National Guard , meth heads and the natural enemy of any grower : The Ex-Girlfriend .
Eventually I drank enough to decamp to the tent hidden in the scrub .
The natural camouflage that made it hard for helicopters to spot also made it hard to find at night in my whiskey shoes .
Using my superior sense of direction and a flashlight I was able to fall in one direction consistently until I fell onto something which proved to be my tent .
Anticipating the character erosion of the untold riches I ’d soon reap for this work , I got in the tent and fell asleep quickly .
I dreamt of a white owl , big as me , hooting in the halls of a great library .
Sometime later I woke to the sound of some thing breaking sticks and mumbling .
Mexicans ?
Ex -Girlfriends ?
I had no way of telling as I was pistol deaf and blind under the rain fly .
Remembering from Spanish class that Mexican gangs never leave witnesses to warn the others that a Mexican gang is coming , I jumped out of the tent , butt naked , hoping for the element of surprise .
My flashlight beam froze a fawn and her mother , cracking their pistolwhips .
“ Lo siento . ”
And so I slept the rest of the night fitfully , for the camp was set up on a well - traveled deer trail .
Dawn was cold , as the sun could n’t penetrate the Redwood canopy .
Getting out of a warm sleeping bag to shiver in the long shadows is always a matter of will and black coffee .
As I trudged up the hill to the kitchen in the main camp , I caught a glimpse of the one view allowed from the hidden hollow , out over the Humboldt fog wreathed at the base of the dry brown hills below .
The Trimmers were already at work with KMUD on the camp radio as I put a pot of water to boil on the blue jet of the turkey fryer .
All the Trimmers were strong women with independent streaks that render them unemployable in the real world .
They are the Grower ’s New Girlfriend ( of course ) , a Lesbian Couple , and some badass cafe au lait chick from L.A. with Jimi Hendrix hair .
The Lesbian Couple were pros , never missing a minute of trimming at the standard rate of 250 dollars per pound .
Years of scissorwork had wizened their eyes back in their heads so they looked like two little possums futzing with the weed .
The L.A. Trimmer and the New Girlfriend were new to the trade , so they took time to eat breakfast .
The only accepted topics of conversations in Humboldt are what ’s your sign , what you ca n’t eat or what dream you had .
I told them about the white owl because I ’m obviously an omnivorous Scorpio .
The femme of the Lesbian Couple allowed that white owls were “ harbingers of good fortune ” while her girl stole my coffee water to make oatmeal for her dog .
We had to listen to KMUD radio for the Community Safety and Awareness Report provided by The Civil Liberties Monitoring Project who watched for any big moves by law enforcement .
Paranoia becomes more insidious when framed by the destitution of listening to “ Legalize It ” for the eleventy hundredth time .
We had been listening to terrible music for days when , finally , they came on the radio and announced : “ This is KMUD with a Citizen ’s Watch Report .
There are three police trucks with ATVs on the back heading up Goose Creek Road .
Okay ?
Repeat : citizens watch has just got a call from a concerned citizen .
They said they were heading up Goose Creek Road about three minutes ago . ”
“ That ’s our road , ” the Grower ’s New Girlfriend pointed out .
The Lesbian Couple seem nonplussed but the LA Trimmer and the New Girlfriend got up and started worrying , ready to run .
The Lesbian Couple shrugged .
“ It ’s a long road . ”
The sound of helicopters thundered over the valley .
The Grower burst out of the reclaimed meth trailer : “ Did n’t you hear the radio ? ” he asked , throwing water on the fire , sending up a big puffy smoke signal .
The helicopters passed over , on to bigger things .
The Grower ’s actions were strange because he had all the Propostion 215 Medical Marijuana cards .
The rule of thumb was that the local D.A. wo n’t bust for less than 99 plants and the local sheriff wo n’t do anything the DA does n’t like .
The Grower also said that he thought a mom and pop operation like ours was unlikely to be busted , but then the Grower also thought that his Ex - Girlfriend was going to be cool , and that had n’t stopped her from showing up and acting like a maniac .
The pale face and bipolar dart of the Ex - Girlfriend ’s eyes gave her that early Manson Family brio .
Her pants were belled around her feet so she walked on heels , her greasy straight blonde hair parted in the middle .
You could see the vein in her forehead jump when she yelled at the Grower , screaming at him for two hours meaner than a soap opera .
And then she left .
We all breathed a sigh of relief and laughed at what had been a tense situation .
Then she came back and caught us laughing .
“ Ha ha , I ’m real funny huh ?
Do n’t you ever fucking laugh at me . ”
She got in my face and I agreed with her , wanting no part of it .
“ You got that , sister ? ” She called the L.A. trimmer “ sister ” because she ’s kind of black , like brother Obama .
“ Do n’t ever laugh at me .
Do you know that you ’re trimming my weed right now ? ”
The L.A. trimmer shot back , “ Then you know that you should be here doing the work instead of standing around fucking me up . ”
It is dangerous to pull a Trimmer out of the focus required to sit and snip in a lopsided camp chair all day .
“ Lets just talk about what ’s on my plate , sister . ”
“ I ’m not your sister , ” the LA Trimmer shot back .
“ Yes , you are .
And I will call you that , sister .
Let ’s talk about what you got on your plate . ”
“ This ai n’t Oprah .
Fuck around and call me sister again .
See what happens . ”
The Ex - Girlfriend ’s eyes bulged and she threatened to do what everyone told her she should have done a long time ago .
Leaving just what that was to our imaginations .
And then she left .
We laughed , quietly this time , lest she return .
The girlfriend ’s sudden appearance cast a pall over the camp and the Growers excuse of “ Do n’t worry about her , she ’s just insane ” was little comfort , considering what she could do with just a phone call to the right Law Enforcement Agency .
Soon every plane in the sky was Feds .
So the Grower delivered the boilerplate pep talk for skittish pot camp employees : “ Law guys wo n’t , as a rule , follow anyone into the woods for fear of booby traps .
So , just hit the woods and they wo n’t follow you .
I ’ll show you the escape route , but you wo n’t need it . ”
The escape route followed the extension of the deer path where my camp was and then ran downhill over a series of fences and through a gullywash where you ca n’t stop running or else you ’ll slide and fall .
Then over a fence and though some poison oak only to come out at the Landowner ’s contraband greenhouse .
“ Then you go out to the road and act like you ’re there to see what the helicopter is circling about . ”
“ Helicopter for us ? ”
“ Or a plane .
I guarantee that when CAMP comes it will be with a spotter .
They come in low and circle around in what they call a death spiral . ”
Since we were in the neighborhood , the Grower thought this might be a good occasion for me to meet the Landowner , who was as stereotypical as the rest of the cast of characters on the farm .
The Landowner is invariably a man living in the woods alone because some heartless wench has stolen his crops every year .
The problem is so prevalent that many growers who still mess with women insist on blindfolding their dates before bringing them back to their camps .
Some even have a no girlfriend rule , having given up on wenches in general .
This leads to a culture almost as devoid of women as hip - hop .
Which is why guys like the Landowner happen .
Our Landowner is one of the old school growers , and looks every bit of it : six - five , 270 pounds , about 60 with a shoulder - length bowl cut tied down with a bandanna , “ Magaritaville ” wifebeater , flannel shirt , Daisy Duke shorts with his balls hanging out , tube socks and high top chucks .
He is known to be a bad man .
The Grower is essentially a sharecropper to the Landowner and owes him 35 percent of the harvest take .
So The Grower and The Landowner traded market rumors from town of “ panic pounds ” selling for eighteen hundred dollars , way below the accepted Pot Farm Bureau Co - Op price of three thousand .
Could these jumpy carpetbaggers make the bottom fall out ?
Could it be that this whole weed - costing - as - much - as - gold thing is just another California bubble ?
A girl wearing rubber boots and a peacoat and a white dude with dreadlocks waved to us .
“ This guy , he ’s a good trimmer . ”
“ A dude that can trim ? ” said the Grower .
“ Yeah , he has a wife , ” the Landowner offered by way of explanation .
Everyone knows men ca n’t trim .
It ’s one of those patriarchal generalizations like white men can’t jump or girls can’t skate which proves itself true often enough that even Proposition 8 - types accept it .
Back at the camp the Grower spent his time doing bong hits , marveling at how he must have at least 40 pounds of good weed ( though he was afraid to tally it up and know for sure just yet ) .
He was living the dream between calls from the Ex-Girlfriend .
The Grower would hang up his cell phone and update us , “ There she goes threatening me again .
I wish she would stop it . ”
“ What ’s she saying ? ”
“ Oh , she ’s like she ’s going to come up here and kill all of us , ” he ’d laugh , drinking the neck off a bottle of Jack Daniels .
Amy Goodman ’s “ Democracy Now ” report played tape of some fool reporter getting stomped by a cop horse at the RNC .
This made the Grower mad enough to subvert the dominant paradigm by getting around to harvesting some more weed .
Without “ Democracy Now ” getting Northern California hippies motivated is like herding cats , if cats went everywhere with fickle untrained dogs .
The Grower took me and his dog Mystre back up to the greenhouse .
He cut plant tops and placed them on strings .
Then I plucked the emblematic seven - fingered marijuana water leaves until my latex gloves were gunked with pollen .
Yes , the buds were all those marijuana words like “ crip , ” “ juicy ” and “ dank . ”
Go get a glossy weed porno at the 7 - 11 if you want to read jargon about the architectural intricacies of a bubba OG kushtop because I ’m over it .
It ’s a weed .
It should n’t cost as much as gold or put people in jail .
***
I hauled the buds from the greenhouse to the drying room and hung them on strings to cure for trimming .
Back and forth for many days and nights .
Days burned away into weeks .
I do n’t know how long I was up there .
Time was n’t really my trip anymore .
The monotony of country life wears the chat out of you .
The group droned on , glued to the radio , stopping whenever the helicopters passed too close .
Things happened .
They must have .
The Grower and I would get drunk and shoot the place up to keep the camp safe from maniacs .
We got good at running the escape route at night drunk as hell because … I forget why .
Oh yeah , because it proved good training when the Grower went to town and the Ex - Girlfriend showed up and the shit hit the fan .
I was enjoying my role as the cook early one evening , bribing the Trimmers with hot chai and fried turkey swiss sandwhiches when the Ex showed up .
“ Where the fuck is The Grower ? “
“ He went to town . ”
“ When is he going to be back ? “
“ We do n’t know . ”
“ Okay then , I guess I ’ll wait . ”
The Ex - Girlfriend took the strangest spot in the area , up at the top of the firepit dug into the road .
The Trimmers did their best to not feel threatened as The Ex Girlfriend lorded over them , seething .
“ Why do n’t you go wait somewhere else ? ” said the L.A. Trimmer .
The Ex -Girlfriend , being used to the way hippies do things , said “ Bet you wo n’t come up here and say that in my face because , bitch , I will pounce on you , I do n’t care if you do have scissors in your — “
The L.A. Trimmer , being used to the way they do things in L.A. , leapt from her seat and flew up the bank into a flurry of girlfight .
She went upside the Ex - Girlfriend ’s head and knocked her down .
“ Who ’s a bitch now ? ” asked the L.A. Trimmer .
The L.A. Trimmer walked away from the tussle with just a patch torn out of the shoulder of her long johns .
The L.A. Trimmer took the cigarette proffered by the now smitten lesbians and lit it up while the Ex - Girlfriend peeled herself up from the dirt .
“ Try and cuss me again , ” said the L.A. Trimmer .
“ I want a do - over , ” the Ex - Girlfriend mumbled .
“ I was n’t ready . ”
“ Better get out of here before I teach you some more manners . ”
The femme lesbian Trimmer told the Ex , “ Ca n’t you feel that this energy is not working here right now ? ”
The Ex - Girlfriend was dazed enough that I could herd her down the road , shooing her like a stray cow every time she wanted to turn back .
The road fell off steeply from either side and there was nowhere for her to run back but through me , and doubting the quality of my mercy , she trudged on .
I felt like a man taking a dog for that final walk .
The Ex - Girlfriend got to the fence where her brown car sat , blocking the gate .
The final steps to her car had the ring of resolution in their heels as she grabbed her cellphone and dialed .
I walked back nonchalantly until I heard her on the phone telling someone directions to the camp
“ Going , yeah right on Goose Creek , the third pullout on the right with a no trespassing sign … I have been assaulted … yes , I am still here now . ”
I ran back to the camp , calculating how far we were from town .
The Lesbian Couple and the L.A. Trimmer were eating chips and salsa and reliving the fight .
“ She called the cops . ”
“ But she was trespassing . ”
I grabbed the weed out of the drying shed , hoping that my drastic action of taking $ 40,000 of weed and stashing it in the woods might rouse them to action but when I got back they were still eating salsa .
“ She was assaulted on a pot farm .
If she tells the cops , they ’ll take everyone to jail and sort it out with lawyers . ”
They chew more slowly as they cogitate .
“ We ca n’t leave by the road because she ’s out there waiting .
So we need to button up and get suited and booted .
Get ready to run and maybe even sleep in the woods tonight . ”
We gathered up whatever incriminating evidence was lying around , pulling the old half bloomed plants up from the greenhouse and tossing them into the woods .
Then the New Girlfriend rolled in , with fresh dents in the hood of the truck .
“ That bitch is crazy . ”
We arranged with the New Girlfriend to meet us on the main road by a particular sign because my cell phone ’s battery was due to run out soon .
I got together a day pack with a change of socks , water , emergency bivvy blanket , flashlight , knife , heavy jacket , warm hat , sleeping mat , chocolate , laptop computer and 20 pounds of marijuana in six black plastic garbage bags , and slid down the hill on the escape route .
“ Listen for a minute . ”
Me and the L.A. Trimmer could hear the Ex - Girlfriend barking at the Grower , but could not make out what she was saying .
An airplane buzzed the valley .
Was it coming for us ?
I took the weed and hid it in the apex of a gully in a dry creek bed by placing ferns on top of it .
Then I turned and walked away , leaving a year ’s worth of the Grower ’s work hidden in the woods .
We walked quiet as spiders on the redwood duff to the Landowner ’s house , listening for sirens , planes or the chop of a K9 unit dog in pursuit .
The Landowner ’s shanty came into view .
I had my doubts about approaching the house unannounced , as Landowners are known to keep vicious hounds .
Plus it was his shotgun that had provided the contrapuntal thunder to the valley .
The sun began to set .
An owl hooted .
It occurred to me that there is nothing so tragic as an omen misread .
The L.A. Trimmer and I went up to the road so as to approach the Landowner ’s house the way a normal person would ( if there were any normal people in these parts ) , holding our hands up , yelling the his name over and over again .
The house was a free - form corrugated tin burrito structure that used to be a greenhouse .
It had the look of a camp hastily erected and then lived in for years .
The Landowner was inside watching television even though his old hounds were at the door barking .
“ Yeah ? ”
“ Ah , The Ex - Girlfriend came back and one of the Trimmers beat her ass . ”
“ Well she deserves whatever beating she gets . ”
“ What ’s the best way to get her out of here ?
The Ex - Girlfriend is still up on the road , ” we paused and listened .
Half a mile away and we could still hear her shrieking .
“ She probably called the law , ” I added .
The Landowner looked over my shoulder at the L.A. Trimmer , who had tucked her hair away under the camouflage hood of her jacket .
“ Well you could take the ridge back up , ” the Landowner swept his arms at the ever darkening forest , “ or , if you let me catch the dogs , I ’ll give you a ride . ”
The Landowner peeled the tarp off a derelict Chevelle in the yard .
“ This car is real life , ” he said .
The Chevelle was modified with a homemade gearbox of shiny sheet metal riveted in under the dashboard .
“ I take the door panels out and run this fucker all the way to the East Coast every year . ”
He turned the key and the car farted up a cloud of blue exhaust and then roared .
His dogs jockeyed for position on his lap as the Chevelle spit gravel all the way up the steep road .
The L.A. Trimmer hid in the back under a blanket as we swerved past the gate where the Ex - Girlfriend was still parked .
She ran into the road frothing at the mouth , beating on the Landowner ’s car and screaming “ This man grows marijuana ! ”
“ Jeezus .
It ’s about time for her to leave the county , ” said the Landowner .
He took us to the two - lane road and dropped us off at the sign where we agreed to meet the New Girlfriend .
A cop , a fire truck and an ambulance screeched around the curve with sirens lit .
We called the New Girlfriend to tell her that we made it .
The Grower took the phone from the New Girlfriend .
“ Where is it ? ”
I tried to tell him where the stash was .
It was hard to communicate because he was worried .
Worried that the raccoons would get into the weed .
Worried that the meth - head neighbor might find a year ’s worth of work and sell it for nothing .
Then the Grower would have to kill everybody to prove a point .
“ It was down that cut bank by the stump , take a right and contour across the hill until you hit a creek bed , under some ferns . ”
“ Yeah , okay .
When you get to town , get your truck off the road .
You know , cops look for dirty trucks coming off the back roads . ”
The description of a Trimmer “ sister ” with a hafro and ass - kicking legs had the cops out in droves .
I got the L.A. Trimmer tucked into a hotel off the main strip .
We tried to clean off the three weeks of woods and waited for the Grower to run the gauntlet into town .
Finally he showed up , filthy with fingernail scratches all around his neck .
“ I could n’t find the truck and figured you ’d left town with the weed . ”
“ I left it in the bush , like I said .
And you told me to hide the truck . ”
“ Well , I looked for the weed out there for a while . ”
This time the innuendo was harder to miss .
“ It ’s there . ”
“ I guess it is , if you ’re here . ”
The Grower sat down heavily and produced a bottle of whiskey from his jacket .
I noticed that he had his pistol tucked in his belt .
He poured us all drinks .
“ Shit , me and the Landowner thought you were long gone with the weed and the truck . ”
A flash of regret must have registered on the faces of me and the L.A. Trimmer because the Grower laughed at us .
“ Tell you what , have a drink .
And live it up , goddammit ! ” he yelled , slinging Johnny Walker Blue all around on the carpet “ If you ’re gonna get into the game you got to live it up , because when they come through that door it ’s all gonna change . ”
We spent the night drinking and watching windows , talking business with the Grower in a room full of suitcases and guns .
The love of easy money has been the ruin of many a poor boy and by morning you know I was one .
So call the cops and tell them to bust me .
Tell them that I ’m coming south right now with some of that dank Humboldt OG babyshit trainwreck kushywushy .
Tell them they ca n’t miss me .
I ’m on the 101 with a dangerous Trimmer from L.A. right now .
I ’m in a white van , a dirty blue Toyota truck and a sedan with hollow doors .
Does n’t matter what I ’m driving , really .
Throw up roadblocks , pull everybody over and let the courts sort it out .
Then bust everyone ordering pizza after ten o’clock .
Bust all the turkey bag buyers .
Get those skinhead pigs from Riverside up in a helicopter to look for dangerous flowers and send these growers indoors where they belong .
Do every bit of that zero tolerance shit and let ’s get this weed price up from the price of gold up to the price of platinum because I ’m trying to live .

The Best
The words may sound sexist , but for Republicans , this button , with its pinkish celebratory hue and the party emblem , signifies a historic shift .
Some slender Australian lizards called skinks have gone from being five - fingered to legless ( like most snakes ) in just 3.6 million years , a new study finds .
That 's a blink of an eye in geologic time .
For comparison , if a 1,000 - sheet roll of toilet paper represented all of Earth 's geologic history , it is only on the last square of paper that bipedal ancestors of Homo sapiens showed up — about 4.5 million years ago , said Penn State geologist Robert Giegengack , who was not involved in the study .
There are 75 species of these fast - evolving skinks called Lerista .
These skinks have been crawling and slithering around Earth for about 13.4 million years , and even today , some have five fingers , some have four and some have none , or tiny stubs for legs .
So researchers from the University of Adelaide used genetic sequences to arrive at a new family tree for the skinks that showed when and how fast they had lost their fingers or entire legs throughout their evolution .
" At the highest rate , complete loss of limbs from a pentadactyl [ five - fingered ] condition is estimated to have occurred within 3.6 million years , " said researcher Adam Skinner of the University of Adelaide , adding that compared to similarly dramatic evolutionary changes in other animals , this is blisteringly fast .
The analysis , detailed in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology and funded by the Hermon Slade Foundation , suggests that the skinks ’ way of life might have driven the dramatic and rapid changes in their body shapes .
" It is believed that skinks are losing their limbs because they spend most of their lives swimming through sand or soil ; limbs are not only unnecessary for this , but may actually be a hindrance , " said Skinner , who headed up the study .
Skinner and his colleagues found that the evolution of a snake - like body form in Lerista skinks has occurred not only repeatedly but without any evidence of reversals ( that is , fingers or limbs being added back ) .
Limb reduction via evolution has occurred many times during the history of life on Earth , in mammals , birds , amphibians , snakes and lizards .
Lizards and snakes are the model cases for study of this biological phenomenon .
About 53 lineages of lizards and snakes are known to have lost one or more bones of their limbs throughout their evolution , Skinner said .
PRINCETON , N.J. , Nov. 13 ( UPI ) -- U.S. scientists have discovered the chains of proteins found in most living organisms act as adaptive machines , able to control their own evolution .
Princeton University researchers said their finding appears to offer evidence of a hidden mechanism that guides the way biological organisms respond to the forces of natural selection .
That , they said , provides a new perspective on evolution .

Researchers Raj Chakrabarti , Herschel Rabitz , Stacey Springs and George McLendon made the discovery while conducting experiments on proteins constituting the electron transport chain , a biochemical network essential for metabolism .
A mathematical analysis of the experiments showed the proteins themselves acted to correct any imbalance imposed on them through artificial mutations and restored the chain to working order .
" The discovery answers an age - old question that has puzzled biologists since the time of Darwin :
How can organisms be so exquisitely complex , if evolution is completely random , operating like a ' blind watchmaker ' ? " said Chakrabarti , an associate research scholar .
" Our new theory extends Darwin 's model , demonstrating how organisms can subtly direct aspects of their own evolution to create order out of randomness . "
The research was published in a recent edition of Physical Review Letters .
It 's time for a real Patriot Act that brings out the patriot in all of us .
We propose universal civilian service for every young American .
Under this plan , All Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty - five will be asked to serve their country by going through three months of basic training , civil defense preparation and community service .
...
Here 's how it would work .
Young people will know that between the ages of eighteen and twenty - five , the nation will enlist them for three months of civilian service .
They 'll be asked to report for three months of basic civil defense training in their state or community , where they will learn what to do in the event of biochemical , nuclear or conventional attack ; how to assist others in an evacuation ; how to respond when a levee breaks or we 're hit by a natural disaster .
These young people will be available to address their communities ' most pressing needs .
You know , I warn , and I warn , and I warn , and I warn , but nobody listens .
Do n't know what I 'm talking about ?
Read on ... Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , President - Elect Obama 's choice for chief of staff in his incoming administration , is co-author of a book , The Plan , that calls for , among other things , compulsory service for all Americans ages 18 to 25 .
The following excerpt is from pages 61 - 62 of the 2006 book :
Emanuel and co-author Bruce Reed insist " this is not a draft , " but go on to write of young men and women , " the nation will enlist them for three months of civilian service . "
They also warn , " [s ] ome Republicans will squeal about individual freedom , " ruling out any likelihood that they would let people opt out of universal citizen service .
As chief of staff , Emanuel will not be in a position to directly introduce public policy , but his enthusiasm for compulsory service , combined with Barack Obama 's own plan to require high school students to perform 50 hours of government - approved service , suggest an unfortunate direction for the new administration .

In the middle of October , with the economy in free fall and the McCain - Palin campaign not far behind , Lou Engle , founder of The Call , which organizes stadium - sized fasting and prayer rallies , sent out an urgent e-mail to supporters .
“ We are in a moment of extraordinary crisis in America , ” was his ominous warning .
“ These elections will shape the future of our nation for decades . ”
With many Americans wondering whether the global financial system was about to implode , Engle ’s mind was elsewhere .
He was summoning his followers to what he termed “ the most significant Call ever , ” which will be held at San Diego ’s Qualcomm Stadium just three days before the election .
Organizing his California rally , Engle has deployed the same rhetorical weapon used by Protect Marriage , the main organizational supporter of Proposition 8 ( the gay marriage ban on the state ’s ballot on November 4 . )
Turning San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ’s words , “ as California goes , so goes the nation , ” on their head , Engle and his allies are portraying California as the bellwether of a national , apocalyptic slide into an irredeemable moral abyss of sexual immorality .
The same tactic , more broadly drawn , is driving all sectors of the fundamentalist right as the election draws near and polls show Obama ahead : one vote can make a difference in this Esther moment , and every Christian ’s vote counts in the quest to save America from Jezebel ’s designs .
While stirring up fears that Satan is taking over America has n’t helped McCain in recent polls , surveys in California show a tight battle over Proposition 8 , with some polls showing support for the ban running slightly ahead of opposition .
Engle is a key part of a formidable and well - funded strategy , run by religious right political organizations and churches , to amend the state ’s constitution to prohibit gay marriage , overturning the decision of the “ activist judges ” of the California Supreme Court .
Engle , a leading figure in the Third Wave Charismatic movement , praised by many cohorts for his raising up of an army of spiritual warriors for revival , has now emerged as a key political mobilizer of young Pentecostals and Charismatics for the religious right .
But Engle , whose previous forays into politics focused on anti-abortion protests , is entering new territory by injecting himself into electoral politics , says Margaret Poloma , a sociologist at the University of Akron and an expert on Pentecostals and Charismatics , who first met Engle in the 1990s .
“ I never thought he was going to launch on his own that way . ”
Engle has intertwined his longtime core issue , abortion , with his opposition to gay marriage by pinning both issues to the necessity of appointing judges who wo n’t allow what Engle calls “ Antichrist legislation ” to stand .
He maintains that the prayers of his young spiritual warriors , who pray and fast at a Capitol Hill location known as the Justice House of Prayer , were responsible for the current , more conservative composition of the Supreme Court .
Engle ’s protegés regularly demonstrate silently in front of the Supreme Court , their lips sealed — symbolic of the silence of what they believe are murdered unborn children — by red “ LIFE ” stickers .
As shown in the documentary Jesus Camp , Engle recruits warriors as early as elementary school for his cause .
The Call ’s advisory board is stacked with prominent Pentecostal and Charismatic preachers , leading figures in the controversial Apostolic movement , which is elevating a new generation of self - appointed prophets and apostles , African - American and Latino religious leaders , Charismatic publishing giant Stephen Strang , and religious right leaders like Perkins , Harry Jackson , and Gary Bauer .
The religious right political leadership ’s keen interest in Engle was evident at The Call held on the National Mall in August .
The day before the event , the public relations firm Shirley Bannister introduced Engle — flanked by Family Research Council president Tony Perkins and former Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee — at a press conference just a few blocks from the White House .
Perkins , one of the most visible political leaders on the religious right , noted Engle ’s influence on young evangelicals , who he claimed were even more conservative on abortion than their parents , though he cited no surveys or polls to support the claim .
At the time , Engle claimed that The Call was not interjecting itself into presidential politics , but he was clearly opposed to Obama .
“ We ’re not endorsing a candidate but challenging language of those who would say we ’re Christian politicians who say that we want abortion to be rare but have voted 100 % for live - birth abortion , partial - birth abortion , ” Engle told reporters .
“ America is looking for a king , but what we need is a return to God . ”
Engle was lukewarm about McCain , but a few weeks later , after McCain tapped Sarah Palin as his running mate , Engle ramped up his support for the Republican ticket , likening Palin to the biblical Queen Esther who saved her people from destruction .
When he was in Washington , I asked Engle whether young evangelicals were looking for the kind of revival he was preaching about , in light of heightened interest in issues beyond abortion and gay marriage .
“ I do n’t mean the old time Pentecostal [ revival ] , ” Engle replied , “ but real returning to God with wholehearted love .
[ Young evangelicals ] return to scriptures as the foundation .
And when that scripture is revealed , and when they read Psalm 139 , ‘ you formed me in my mother ’s womb ’ , ‘ before I was born you knew me , ’ this becomes more than doctrine , it becomes experience .
It becomes knowing the love of God for the individual from the beginning of his life , he ’s not an accident , they ’re not a piece of protoplasm .
They become fervent and vote on that issue . ”
That fervency was evident on The Mall the next day in a racially diverse crowd estimated by organizers at 50,000 or more .
The Call events , which Engle says are based on the solemn assemblies and fasts of Joel 2 , demand repentance , prayer , and fasting in preparation for Christ ’s return .
“ I am an end - time warrior ! ” attendees were commanded to declare .
End - times prophecy mingled with Christian rock music , and the day saw a parade of well - known activist speakers , including Huckabee and Perkins , Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney , and Teen Mania founder Ron Luce .
Engle , per his custom , likened his crusade against abortion to Martin Luther King Jr. ’s civil rights movement .
He rocked back and forth , as though davening , preached against Roe v. Wade , and shouted , as the crowd prayed and spoke in tongues , “ this is a Passover Day for America .
Today , we plead the blood of Jesus on the doorpost ! ”
Purity covenants , requiring abstention from even thinking about sex outside of marriage , were distributed .
Participants were urged to consecrate themselves , to be ready for the moment when Jesus “ is going to rule over Washington DC and the world . ”
“ Repentance and revival cannot start in the building behind me , ” said Huckabee , his back to the Capitol , “ until it starts in the temple inside me . ”
The notion that Christ ’s followers , his bride , have been unfaithful to their bridegroom , was pervasive .
“ God will not share you with any other lover , ” Engle told the crowd , standing in the blazing summer sun .
“ We ’ve been adulterers ” to God , he went on , “ but we ’re going to return to our wedding vows . ”
Engle and his cofounder of the International House of Prayer ( IHOP ) in Kansas City , evangelist Mike Bickle , insist that continual prayer is required for this covenantal relationship to be restored in preparation for Jesus ’ return .
Bickle said , “ God wants to build a global house of prayer before Jesus returns , ” and Engle called it “ a global army of prayer in the last days . ”
“ Do you believe America can change ? ” Bickle demanded .
“ God will not do it without continual prayer . ”
James Antoine , a 36 - year - old Wal - Mart pharmacy employee from Houston , told me he spent a week at the Kansas City IHOP , where young people pray around the clock , which he called “ powerful and life - changing . ”
( Antoine , who is African American , would not tell me who he was voting for but said he could not vote for a candidate who favored abortion rights . )
IHOP “ stirs young people , ” Antoine told me , and “ keeps them continuously alert about the end - times .
So they ca n’t be distracted because they ’re continuously being bombarded by the preaching of the end - times so it ’s continuously on their heart and their minds . ”
This kind of prayer — where young people deprive themselves of the earthly , and are so enmeshed in Bickle ’s end - times theology that they can think of nothing else — is the weapon in spiritual warfare against Satan .
“ The enemy , ” added Antoine , “ has crept in unaware in our schools and universities , even in the world at large .
We have not stood up .
Even taking prayer out of schools , taking the Ten Commandments .
He wants to remove everything that is godly .
But God has called us to rise up and say it has to stop … they ’ve already ruled ‘ In God We Trust ’ off of money .
The enemy is doing all these things to bombard us .
But we ’ve got to do like this , we ’ve got to stand back up . ”
Joshua Tombley , a 19 - year - old wearing jeans and a T - shirt and sporting just a few sprouts of facial hair , cheerfully discussed the end - times scenario as a marriage , linking it to Judaism .
( All day , Jews were exhorted to discover Jesus . )
“ The church is the bride of Christ , and Jesus is the bridegroom , ” said Tombley , who was passing out business cards advertising a House of Prayer , unaffiliated with Engle , in Newport News , Virginia .
“ In Jewish culture , you had to spend a year or more in your father ’s house before you could actually get married …
So God will send back Jesus to get his bride as in Jewish custom , as Jews , as Hebrews did for thousands of years , that custom was the tradition that God is working in now . ”
“ My theology is the Lord says ‘ be ye ready when I come , ’ ” added Antoine .
“ We have to be prepared , we should always be ready . ”
Engle unabashedly credits prayer for George W. Bush ’s presidency and his subsequent appointment of Supreme Court Justices who upheld the ban on so - called “ partial - birth abortion . ”
“ The praying church deals with the demonic realm , so that God raises up one and brings down the other , ” Engle said in a recent video on The Call ’s Web site , explaining how prayer proved victorious over satanic forces in the spiritual warfare of an election , adding , “ I directly attribute [ Bush ’s election ] to the prayers of the saints . ”
Young people at his House of Prayer , said Engle , had been praying about judges for three years when Sandra Day O’Connor retired and William Rehnquist died .
As if to prove to his acolytes that their prayer and fasting is not in vain , Engle maintains that their prayers and prophecies shaped the Supreme Court .
“ One of the young ladies had a dream , ” Engle asserted , “ that a man named John Roberts would be the next Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . ”
He beams with pride .
“ Do n’t you think those kids were baptized with confidence ?
Their prayers , I believe , were literally moving a king to appoint a justice who has now led a court that has banned partial - birth abortion .
Do n’t tell me prayer does n’t shape a nation . ”
In one of several laudatory e-mails about Palin , Engle recently began to label Obama as Satan more explicitly .
“ The ideological beast of Obama ’s worldview has been drawn out of its lair and now stands naked and exposed by Palin ’s compassion and conviction .
The beast , ” he continued , “ is hunting our children , our nation ’s destiny , and us .
The rage of the media against Palin simply further exposes the moral bankruptcy , bigotry , and lack of compassion of liberalism . ”
Engle insists that he , an ardent foe of abortion , and not Obama , is MLK ’s ideological heir .
He likened the media to segregationists , calling them “ Obama ’s court prophets …
Selma ’s new sheriffs of the South beating the new heirs of the civil rights movement — the millions of unborn children attacked in the womb . ”
But despite his militant exhortation to go to war with fellow Americans , his followers see a divine hand .
“ I think , ” said Tombley , “ he ’s chosen by God to do what he ’s doing right now . ”
Conservative Austria was in a state of shock today after the male successor to Jörg Haider admitted to having a longstanding “ special relationship ” with the far right leader who died dramatically in a high speed car crash earlier this month .
Stefan Petzner – the 27 - year - old who recently replaced Haider as leader of the right wing Alliance for the Future of Austria and has often appeared in tears on television since his death - effectively outed himself as the deceased ’s gay lover while being interviewed on an Austrian radio breakfast show .
“ I had to go to him .
I had to go to him , ” Mr Petzner said in his highly emotional interview as he recalled how he rushed to the hospital where the dead body of 52 - year - old Haider was lying after his fatal crash in early October .

Admitting that he felt a “ magnetic attraction ” for Haider , whom he met five years ago while working as a cosmetics reporter , Mr Petzner insisted : “ We had a relationship that went far beyond friendship .
Jörg and I were connected by something truly special .
He was the man of my life . ”
He insisted that Mr Haider ’s widow , Claudia did not object to his relationship : “ She loved him as a woman .
He loved her as a man .
I loved him in a completely different and personal way .
She understood that , ” Mr Petzner said .
However , the young man ’s sister Christiane suggested in a newspaper interview that Mrs Haider had not always been so understanding .
“ Sometimes Claudia was jealous because Stefan would spend more time with her husband than she did . ”
Clearly embarrassed by the revelations , party officials today attempted to limit the political damage and cancelled forthcoming interviews with Mr Petzner .
Their attempts to prevent his radio interview being rebroadcast , however , were unsuccessful .
The revelations came after photographs in the Austrian media showing Mr Haider in a gay bar shortly before his fatal accident .
Witnesses who were present at a magazine launch party where the two men were seen together on the night of the crash were quoted today as saying that Mr Haider had left in a hurry after an emotional argument with his deputy .
The far - right leader crashed his Volkswagen limousine while drunk and driving at more than double the speed limit , as he made his way to his mother ’s birthday party in the early hours of the morning .
He is reported to have told his chauffeur to go home .
More than 25,000 people flocked to his quasi state funeral in Klagenfurt , the capital of the Austrian province of Carinthia where he was governor for more than a decade .
He died just days after his party had more than doubled its share of the vote in Austria ’s general election and speculation swirled that he would once again figure in Austrian national politics .
Nearly a decade ago , Mr Haider had been part of the ruling coalition with his Freedom Party , triggering EU sanctions on Austria after he praised Adolf Hitler ’s employment policies and described Nazi SS veterans as “ decent men . ”
Austrian attitudes to gays in politics contrast sharply with neighbouring Germany where numerous politicians have outed themselves as homosexuals without anyone batting an eyelid .
Rumours that Haider was either gay or bi-sexual first surfaced in Austria nearly a decade ago .
However the far right leader , who fathered two children with his wife Claudia , refused to discuss them , fearing that they would alienate thousands of his ultra conservative followers .
Although his party was nicknamed the “ Haider ’s boy party ” , until today conservative Austria had preferred to embrace his public persona as a traditional family man .
Mr Petzner ’s revelations have shattered that charade , and there was speculation today that after not even a month in the job , he might soon find himself replaced as leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria .
Viking Age Arms and Armor
Viking Axe
When people think of Viking age weapons , they usually think first of the battle axe , and the image that forms in their mind is a massive weapon that only a troll could wield .
In reality , battle axes in the Viking age were light , fast , and well balanced , and were good for speedy , deadly attacks , as well as for a variety of nasty , clever moves .
The axe was often the choice of the poorest man in the Viking age .
Even the lowliest farm had to have a wood axe ( left ) for cutting and splitting wood .
In desperation , a poor man could pick up the farm axe and use it in a fight .
Axes meant for battle were designed a bit differently than farm axes .

The photo to the left shows two reproduction battle axes based on 10th century finds , while the photo on the right shows a historic 10th century axe head .
Axe heads were made of iron and were single edged .
A wide variety of axe head shapes were used in the Viking age .
The sketch to the right shows three different 11th century axe heads , while the photo to the left shows three earlier axe heads .
In the early part of the Viking era , the cutting edge was generally 7 to 15 cm ( 3 - 6 in ) long , while later in the Viking age , axes became much larger .
Breið -øx ( broad axes ) had crescent shaped edges 22 to 45 cm ( 9 - 18 in ) long .
The cutting edge of the largest of the axe heads shown to the right is 22 cm ( 9in ) long .
The edge of this axe is made of hardened steel welded to the iron head .
The join line is clearly visible in the sketch and in the historical axe head .
The steel permitted the axe to hold a better edge than iron would have allowed .
Some axe heads were elaborately decorated with inlays of precious metals , notably the Mammen axe head .
The head is decorated on every flat surface with inlays of silver and gold and was found in a rich grave that dates from the year 971 .
Typically , axeheads had a wedge - shaped cross section .
The cross section of the head near the edge was sometimes diamond shape , which provided for greater strength for a given weight of iron .
( A modern reproduction is shown in the near left photo , while a photo of a historic axe head with that diamond edge profile is shown to the right . )
Fóstbræðra saga chapter 23 tells of a special axe made by Bjarni for Þormóðr , which was hammered all the way out to the edge with no obstructions , resulting in a very sharp blade .
Some axeheads had very thin , elegant cross-sections .
( A reproduction is shown in the middle left and a historic axe far left , all on similar scales ) .
This axe is too thin and delicate for splitting wood ; this axe is meant for splitting skulls .
Some axe heads ( notably thick , wedge shaped axe heads such as the one seen to the left ) show evidence of having been made as a single piece , with the eye ( the hole for the haft ) punched out with a drift .
The thinner blades often show evidence of having been folded around what would eventually become the eye and welded together with a steel bit for the edge .
In some cases , the wrap was symmetrical , while in other cases , the wrap was asymmetrical , with the weld just forward of the eye .
The photo to the left shows two historical Viking age axe heads .
The axe head in the foreground shows evidence of having been folded around the eye , while the thick axe head in the background had the eye punched out with a drift .
Some historical axe heads have a visible weld on the back side ( the hammer side ) of the eye .
It has been suggested that these heads were fabricated by shaping the general form of the head , then splitting the back of the head through its thickness , creating a Y - shaped cross-section .
The two arms of the Y were wrapped around to form the eye and forge welded together .
A reproduction axe head made using this technique is shown to the right .
The eyes typically were D - shaped or shield - shaped , rather than round , and the back ( the hammer ) was often flat and thicker than the sides , as can be seen on the three historical Viking - axe axe heads to the left , and in the reproduction axe head to the right .
I 'm not aware of any archaeological evidence for double edged axe heads , nor of any mention of them in the stories .
Some translators use " double - bladed axe " for the word bryntröll , but I believe that usage is unwarranted .
As discussed in more detail in the article on miscellaneous weapons , we do n't know what sort of weapon that bryntröll refers to .
In chapter 2 of Valla - Ljóts saga , it is said that Ljótur carried a bryntröll when he was in a good mood .
When he was in a killing mood , he carried a snaghyrnd öx ( snag - horned axe ) .
We do n't know how this form differed from a normal axe .
Virtually all Viking - age axe heads are iron ( or steel ) , although a bronze axe head ( left ) was found in Iceland in a Viking age context , which raises a number of interesting questions about why bronze would have been used in this application .
The head has an iron cutting bit , now heavily eroded .
One wonders whether men used sheaths on their axes in the Viking age to protect against accidental cuts .
There is little archaeological evidence to suggest their use , notably a few finds from Hedeby .
The available literary evidence does not suggest they were used .
In the Sagas of Icelanders , knives in sheaths are mentioned , saxes in sheaths are mentioned , swords in scabbards are mentioned , but there seems to be no mention of spears in sheaths or axes in sheaths .
Indeed , there are more than a few examples suggesting that axes could be instantly put to use without any need to prepare them by , for example , removing the sheath .
In chapter 144 of Íslendinga saga ( which takes place well after the end of the Viking age ) , it is said that an unnamed man was accidentally wounded by an axe as men mounted their horses to ride to a killing in west Iceland .
The episode suggests that the head of the axe was not covered .
The sheath shown to the right is a modern reconstruction based on examples from well after the end of the Viking age .
This replica axe is wickedly sharp , and my sense is that a sheath is essential unless one is extremely vigilant at all times .
Perhaps that is what was done in the Viking age .
The axe haft was made of wood .
One source ( Kirpichnikov ) suggests that axe hafts typically were 80 cm long ( 32in ) .
But surely , the haft was sized for the intended use of the axe and to balance the axe head .
The Bayeux tapestry suggests axes with much longer hafts ( right ) , and modern replicas with longer hafts ( left ) prove to be useful tools and powerful weapons .
Axes with smaller heads no doubt had shorter hafts and were used one handed , while longer hafted axes were used two handed .
Both of the reproduction axes shown to the left are nicely balanced , despite the obvious difference in the length of their hafts .
The longer haft is 140 cm ( 55 in ) , while the shorter is 70 cm ( 28in ) .
The long reach of the two - handed axe is clearly visible in the photo to the right .
There are a number of ways of affixing the head to the haft .
One approach is to taper the eye of the axe head and the haft , so that the head fits firmly on the shaft and cannot fly off the end .
However the head is fitted , the axe must resist both pulling and pushing forces .
The sagas suggest that sometimes axe heads flew off their hafts in a fight ( which must have been very discouraging for the fighter using the axe ) .
Harðar saga ( chapter 36 ) says that Hörður was encircled by his opponents .
He was able to kill six men with his axe until the head came off the haft .
Then Þorsteinn gullknappr was able to strike a blow with his axe that killed Hörður .
There 's little information on the details of axe hafts used in the Viking age .
Based on our work reconstructing Viking - age axe combat techniques , I have some preferences which may not be shared by other modern practitioners , nor by the Vikings who used these weapons in earnest 1000 years ago .
The haft I prefer is straight , with little in the way of a flare or other stop at the butt end .
Its sides are flattened , and the surface is smooth to facilitate sliding the hands along the haft so the the grip can be shortened or lengthened smoothly as the space between combatants changes during the fight .
Needless to say , my modern preferences tell us nothing about the nature of axe hafts in the Viking age .
During the Viking age , axe hafts were probably created using riving .
A detailed description of riving a Viking axe haft is here .
One advantage of axes with shorter hafts is that they can be easily hidden .
An axe can be held in reserve behind a shield , a trick used by Þorgeirr in chapter 12 of Fóstbræðra saga .
In a fight with Snorri , Þorgeirr threw down his spear and took up his hidden axe in his right hand , using it to cut through Snorri 's spear shaft , and then through Snorri 's head .
Small axes could be hidden under a cloak and used for a surprise attack ( left ) .
In chapter 22 of Fóstbræðra saga , Þormóður unexpectedly pulled an axe out from under his cloak and struck Loðinn in the head , killing him .
A speculative reconstruction of that move is shown in this Viking combat demonstration video , part of a longer fight .
Some believe that the axe , being poorly balanced , was harder to control than a well balanced weapon like a sword .
That is not the case for a well - made axe .
The photos show a 12th century axe .
The haft , while not original , is ancient .
The total weight of the axe is only 770g ( 1.7 lb. ) , less than some swords .
In the hand , it 's beautifully balanced , fast , and is easily directed towards the target .
It 's hard to claim that an axe is brutish or sluggish after experiencing something as well balanced as this example .
One advantage of an axe over other edged weapons is that the curved edge concentrates all the force of the blow into a small section of the edge , so the axe has enough power to punch through a helmet or mail .
The sagas often mention axe blows that cleave the head down to the shoulders .
A speculative reconstruction of that move is shown in this Viking combat demonstration video , part of a longer fight .
The curved shape of the head allows the axe to be used for a variety of moves .
It can be used to hook an opponent 's ankle , throwing him off balance and onto the ground .
The axe head can be hooked over other body parts , such as the neck ( right ) , to compel a person to move in a direction he does n't wish to go .
Chapter 22 of Sturlu saga describes how Þorsteinn hooked one of Sturla 's men with his axe and dragged him over to where he could be stabbed .
Additionally , the axe can be used to hook the edge of the shield ( left ) , pulling it away for an attack , or for a disarm .
Þorskfirðinga saga ( ch. 10 ) says that Askmaðr ran around his opponent in an attempt to hook his shield away .
A speculative reconstruction of this move is shown in this Viking combat demo video , as part of a longer fight .
The pointed " horns " at each end of the head ( öxarhyrna ) were kept sharp so they could be used offensively , as was done by Kolbeinn in chapter 5 of Grænlendinga þáttur .
He drove the horn of his axe into Þórð 's throat , killing him .
The horns can also be used for slashing attacks , such as across the belly .
Because the axe horn widens so much more than a spear point or a sword point , the horns create vicious wounds when used for stabbing .
Axes ( as well as other weapons ) were sometimes used to strike a blow that was not intended to be lethal .
The öxarhamar ( axe hammer ) , the backside of the axe head , was used for that purpose .
Sometimes , the blow was made to humiliate an opponent , or in other cases , was made against an opponent so inferior that he did n't seem worthy of a proper blow .
In chapter 9 of Þórðar saga hreðu , Özurr and his men surrounded the cowardly Þórhallr and forced him to betray the location of his friend , Þórðr .
Özurr struck at Þórhallr with the back of his axe , knocking him out , and said , " It 's bad to have a slave as your best friend . "
In at least one case , the axe hammer was used to strike an unintended but lethal blow .
In chapter 146 of Brennu - Njáls saga , Þorgeirr rushed to attack Þorkell , but as he did so , another man came at Þorgeirr from behind .
As Þorgeirr raised his axe in the backswing , the axe hammer struck the man behind on the skull , killing him .
With the forward swing , Þorgeirr chopped off one of Þorkel 's arms at the shoulder .
In chapter 16 of Ljósvetninga saga , the story is told where an axe was used where a more suitable tool might have served better .
Once when he was young , Guðmundr used his hand to wave mosquitoes off the bald spot of his foster father while the old man napped outside .
His brother Einar suggested he use his axe , instead , to drive the mosquitoes away .
Guðmundr took the advice , drawing blood from the old man 's head .
Only then did Guðmundr realize that Einar 's advice was not well intended .
The bad blood between the brothers continued into adulthood .
It seems unlikely that axes were routinely thrown in fights , but in desperation , men did whatever was necessary to succeed , including throwing their axe .
One example is told in chapter 33 of Harðar saga og Hólmverja .
In a battle , Þorvaldr drove a spear through Sigurðr , who had been fighting with an axe .
Sigurðr threw his axe at Þorvaldr , hitting him in the head .
They both fell down dead .
The sense of the story is that the axe was Sigurð 's normal battle axe , rather than a specialized throwing axe .
In chapter 64 of Laxdæla saga , Helgi Hardbeinsson received a serious wound in a fight .
Turning to the others , he said , " This old fellow still dares to face others , " and he threw his wood axe at Þorgils , causing a serious wound .
The battle at Stiklastaðir ( which occurred on 29 - July - 1030 ) is described in chapter 226 of Óláfs saga helgi .
The saga says that large numbers of armed men fought on each side .
Men in the front rank used their swords , while those in the next rank thrust with their spears .
Men in the rear shot arrows and javelins and threw stones and hand - axes ( handöx ) at the opposite side .
The historic axe head shown to the left resembles Frankish throwing axes that predate the Viking age .
Perhaps some of these axes were still in use and found their way to Norse lands in the Viking era .
Other clever moves with axes are described in the sagas .
In chapter 62 of Eyrbyggja saga , Þrándr leapt up and hooked the head of his axe over the wall of a fortification at the farm at Eyrr ( shown to the right as it appears today ) .
He pulled himself up by his axe handle into the fortification and cut off Hrafn 's arm with his axe .
The story does n't describe the details of the fortification ( virki ) .
The sketch to the right shows a wooden fortification that has some elements consistent with the fortifications described in the sagas , including a rampart at the top of the fortification from where combatants could hurl missiles towards the combatants outside .
In the battle at Eyrr described above , Óspakur repeatedly went out on to the fortification to hurl stones at Snorri 's men .
While thus exposed , Snorri threw a spear at Óspakur , wounding him so that he fell out of the fortification where Snorri could kill him .
Pictorial sources teach us about axe techniques .
For example , images from the Bayeux tapestry ( left and right ) show combatants using their axes two - handed , but left - handed .
Thus , the blows come in on the undefended side of their opponents .
The sagas suggest that occasionally axes failed during use .
There are many examples where axeheads shattered , notably when they hit a stone or other hard object ( e.g. , Egils saga chapter 38 , and Eiríks saga rauða chapter 11 ) .
Another type of failure was described earlier in this article , in which the head flies off the haft as told in chapter 38 of Harðar saga og Hólmverja .
Axe hafts were used for defense , which sometimes resulted in failure of the haft .
In chapter 16 of Króka - Refs saga , Narfi came upon Grani as he was making unwelcome advances on Narfi 's wife .
Narfi thrust repeatedly with his spear at Grani , who had an axe in his hand .
Grani parried the thrusts with his axe , but eventually Narfi ran him through .
Narfi dragged the body away and covered it while Grani was still in his death - throes .
In chapter 21 of Fljótsdæla saga , Þorkell drew his sword and struck at Gunnar .
Gunnar raised his axe over his head to parry , and the sword hit the axehead such that it stuck in the axehead .
Gunnar raised the axe further to stop the fight .
In chapter 58 of Eyrbyggja saga , Óspakr parried a blow with his axe .
The blow struck the haft , breaking it in two .
The sagas say that axe hafts were sometimes wrapped with iron or other metals to reduce the possibility that the haft would break when used to parry edged weapons , or when otherwise stressed .
Brennu - Njáls saga ( ch. 87 ) says that Hrappr Örgumleiðason carried an axe with a wrapped shaft ( vafinskepta ) .
Hrappr used the axe several times in the saga , notably to cut in two the backbone of Ásvarðr , who had been charged with protecting Guðrún , whom Hrappr was trying to seduce .
When Guðmundr later saw the axe and asked why it was bloody , Hrappr replied that he had been taking care of Ásvarðr 's backache .
The historical axe shown to the left dates from after the end of the Viking age , but shows how axe hafts might have been wrapped in the Viking age .
A detail of the wrap is shown to the right .
The haft is probably not original , but it is certainly ancient .
The bend near the head is clearly intentional , part of the design of the weapon .
The bend helps maximize the transfer of power from arm , shoulder , and upper body to the contact point of the edge with its target .
The weapon jumps into the hand and becomes a natural extension of the arm .
It 's highly likely that a haft of this type was made from wood that naturally grew with that bend .
The grain of such a piece of wood would follow the bend , resulting in a very strong haft .
The need for such haft protection is graphically demonstrated by the divots in the haft of my replica axe ( left ) .
Even though we use blunt - edged weapons , the haft has been scarred by the hits it has received in demonstrations and practice sessions .
It 's easy to believe that a sharp weapon would have caused significantly more damage , possibly resulting in the failure of the haft .
Iron protection would have reduced that risk .
This is it .
Crunch time .
The 2009 Ford F - 150 and Dodge Ram are rolling onto the market like a pair of gigantic craps dice , and the companies tossing them are each betting big on this game .
Unfortunately , the rules changed while these dice were in mid-air .
Fuel prices skyrocketed , the economy tanked , consumer confidence evaporated , and folks who once chose half - ton pickups more for their Marlboro - Man-image - enhancing qualities than for their towing or hauling capabilities are shopping elsewhere .
Ford claims it sells more of its half - ton pickups to work and commercial customers than its competitors do , and Ford predicts this segment will grow to 45 percent of F - 150 sales .
Toward that end , the truck 's fully boxed chassis is further fortified to provide best - in - class rigidity , payload capacity ( up to 3030 pounds ) , and tow ratings ( up to 11,300 pounds ) .
As such , the new F - 150 is well positioned to capture contractors migrating down - market out of Super - Dutys to save money and gas ( did we mention that a new six - speed automatic , a lighter , more aerodynamic cab , and other tweaks boost fuel economy by 12 percent with the 5.4 - liter ? ) .

Ford claims payload and towing numbers like that simply can't be had with a coil - sprung rear axle , so it stuck with leafs but made them longer to smooth the ride and wider with new mounting hardware to improve lateral rigidity and roll control .
The ride does n't quite match Dodge's , but the chassis engineers managed to tune the steering for pleasing heft and remarkable accuracy that had many judges lauding the F - 150s for feeling smaller and nimbler than their Dodge counterparts .
Lateral grip of 0.70 g for both Fords bested all but the feathery base Dodge and Suzuki , and our rear - drive SXT scored the best stop at 133 feet from 60 mph ( the three - ton Lariat needed 144 feet ) .
Status - conscious contractors will have eight F - 150 models from which to choose ( including the forthcoming SVT Raptor ) , which Detroit editor Todd Lassa reckons is " about four too many , " adding , " If this Lariat is the third truck from the top , how much of a boudoir must the King Ranch and Platinum interiors be ? "
Judges praised the low noise levels and interior materials quality , though some found the design cartoonishly macho .
Still , handy features like the Tailgate Step , Box Side Step , a stowable bed - extender , and rear seats that fold up with one hand to reveal a broad , flat load floor help tally a strong superiority score .

On the negative side of the ledger is Ford 's aging all - V - 8 - engine lineup , which is composed of two - and three - valve 4.6 - liters and a three - valve 5.4 .
SVT will bring a bigger 6.2 in the Raptor , and an EcoBoost V - 6 is likely to join the lineup for folks who do n't tow , but the diesel is on hold .
The base V - 8 handily outruns and outhauls the V - 6 Dodge , but sounds and feels strained doing so .
Gearing that 's a third shorter than the Dodge 's kept our 5.4 - liter 4x4 within 0.6 second of the big Dodge , but costs it at the pump , where both trucks averaged just 13.2 mpg over 500 miles of mixed driving .
The new six - speed automatic features excellent tow / haul - mode programming ( ordering downshifts with a tap of the brakes on downhill grades , holding lower gears , etc. ) , but in normal mode , it 's lethargic to kick down , and there 's no way to manually select the higher gears .

Both Fords tackled our off - road sand - loop with aplomb .
The 4x4 transfer case engaged high - and low - range settings quickly and easily , with the message center confirming the shift was in process .
We 're disappointed , however , that there 's no on - pavement AWD option as offered by Dodge and General Motors .
Coming into the final discussion , the Dodge and Ford were running close in the superiority category .
In this price - sensitive market , neither truck held a tie - breaking advantage in the value category .
The scales also looked level weighing the significance of Ford 's high sales and model - range breadth against the game - changing nature of the Dodge suspension .
In the end , we accept the prediction that work trucks will come to dominate this segment and give the nod to the more capable , broader - reaching Ford in the closest vote in Truck of the Year history -- and we sincerely hope neither company craps out when these dice come to rest .

Livingston County Prosecutor David F. Morse announced Monday that he will not file charges against a 14 - year - old Pinckney High School girl who took explicit cell phone photos of herself and sent them to two boys , or against the students who sent them to another 200 cell phones .
Morse said school suspensions for about 20 students and parental discipline were sufficient punishment , even though , because the girl is a minor , the incident amounted to criminal distribution of child pornography .
Morse urged parents to attend a program at Pathfinder School in the Pinckney district at 7 p.m. Wednesday , " Analog Parents with Digital Children . "
" If parents are going to provide their children with technology , they should be aware of the capabilities of that technology , and the dangers that unsupervised use of that technology can bring , " Morse said .
While some parents were skeptical , he said , if the images had made it online , " predators could interpret that as an open invitation to make contact " with the girl .
He said proof came in a Freedom of Information
Act request filed last week by a New York prison inmate who is serving 20 years to life for sexual assault on a minor .
The inmate sought the police report on the investigation , with the girl 's name , address , phone number , and the photos and videos .
Morse said he must release the report , but will do so without the personal information , photos or videos .
He said the request proves people are trolling the Internet and news media for cases like this .
Morse 's decision marks the end of a case that began in October when police confiscated six mobile phones with about 20 pictures and two , 30 - second videos that the Pinckney girl had taken of her genitals and showing her face .
The girl sent the images to two boys , but when school resumed they were distributed to an estimated 200 students .
Livingston Sheriff 's Detective Lt. Todd Luzod said the girl involved committed a crime by sending the photos to her friends .
" It 's really important to educate the students to realize once you put something like that out over the air like that , you have no idea how many cell phones or computers it could go to , " Luzod said .
In an unrelated incident about a week later , Dexter High School officials confiscated six cell phones and an iPod there because carrying inappropriate images .
That case remains in the Washtenaw County prosecutor 's office .
About a week later , Fowlerville officials reported that a 14 - year - old girl there sent photos of herself to friends .
Four students were suspended for a day .
Several students in Brighton were charged in juvenile court after a similar incident in June , Morse said .
He said charges were dismissed after the students wrote papers about the dangers of transmitting sexually explicit photos of themselves or friends .
" Kids need to realize there can be unintended consequences from this type of behavior , " Morse said .
" And for parents , it 's one more reminder to keep a close eye on what their kids are doing both with computers and cell phones . "

I ’ve got a new year ’s resolution and a new slogan for the country .
The resolution may be difficult , but it ’s essential .
Americans must resolve to be smarter going forward than we have been for the past several years .
Look around you .
We have behaved in ways that were incredibly , astonishingly and embarrassingly stupid for much too long .
We ’ve wrecked the economy and mortgaged the future of generations yet unborn .
We do n’t even know if we ’ll have an automobile industry in the coming years .
It ’s time to stop the self - destruction .
The slogan ?
“ Invest in the U.S. ”
By that I mean we should stop squandering the nation ’s wealth on unnecessary warfare overseas and mindless consumption here at home and start making sensible investments in the well - being of the American people and the long - term health of the economy .
The mind - boggling stupidity that we ’ve indulged in was hammered home by a comment almost casually delivered by , of all people , Bernie Madoff , the mild - mannered creator of what appears to have been a nuclear - powered Ponzi scheme .
Madoff summed up his activities with devastating simplicity .
He is said to have told the F.B.I. that he “ paid investors with money that was n’t there . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Just months after he was ousted from Lehman Brothers , Joseph Gregory put his mansion in tony Bridgehampton on the market for $ 32.5 million .

The former president of the sinking investment bank could not have picked a worse time .
The Hamptons , a summer vacation playground for New York ’s financial and celebrity elite , are being hit hard as Wall Street power houses like Lehman and Bear Stearns succumb to the financial crisis .
According to a report by Douglas Elliman , real estate prices fell 11.1 percent in the third quarter in the Hamptons , an exclusive section on the eastern tip of Long Island , less than 100 miles from New York City .
According to Gregory ’s real estate agent , he and his wife are selling because they spent little time there after purchasing and upgrading the posh property two years ago .
But the Gregorys are not the only Wall Streeters opting out of the Hamptons as the financial markets crumble .
The financial sector has announced 220,506 job cuts so far this year , the most of any industry , according to a recent report by global outplacement consultancy Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
In November alone , there were 91,356 job cuts announced , the report showed .
Citigroup has said it plans to eliminate a whopping 52,000 jobs , while Bank of America has said it will cut 35,000 , with some of the job losses expected to be in New York .
Wall Streeters who have not lost their job face bonuses that will sharply pale in comparison to previous years .
That bonus is the bulk of their compensation .
“ There is a palpable fear I sense right now from people who realize they may be in over their heads with a mortgage or are anxious about selling their homes , ” said Diane Saatchi , senior vice president at Corcoran Group Real Estate in East Hampton .
“ While they have not pressed the panic button , more homes should be up for sale in the months ahead , ” said Saatchi , who estimates that 25 to 30 percent of homeowners and potential buyers are from the financial sector .
The average sales price in the Hamptons was $ 1,537,512 in the third quarter of 2008 , down 11.1 percent from the previous quarter and down 23.3 percent from the third quarter of 2007 , according to Prudential Douglas Elliman ’s latest quarterly report .
The number of sales tumbled to 257 , 27 percent fewer than the previous quarter and 28.8 percent below the third quarter of 2007 , the report showed .
“ The region certainly looks vulnerable and there is a lot of concern because of its close ties to Wall Street , ” said Jonathan Miller , of appraisal firm Miller Samuel in New York , who prepared the report .
Throughout the United States , the housing market is suffering its worst downturn since the Great Depression .
A huge supply of unsold homes , tighter lending standards and record foreclosures have slashed home prices .
While high - end homes have weathered earlier housing market downturns , close ties with struggling Wall Street have hit the Hamptons this time .
One person looking to sell is Michael Hampton , a retired advertising executive .
He put his luxurious home with panoramic ocean views on the market for $ 5.995 million a year ago .
Instead of the bidding war he expected over a property nestled among the rich and famous in Montauk , the easternmost town , he has received not a single offer .
“ It is as if somebody held up the stop sign , ” said Hampton , who bought the property to renovate and sell it for a profit .
“ While I have no urgency to unload the property , it is frustrating that I cannot start another project because there is only so much in the piggy bank , ” he said .
Sitting tight is the advice many real estate agents are giving their clients .
“ With some economists and politicians reporting this is the bottom and others predicting there is a long and deep global recession ahead , when there is a choice , inaction seems a wise decision , ” said Corcoran Group ’s Saatchi .
Peter Turino , president of the Hamptons offices of luxury real estate agent Brown Harris Stevens , said that in the long term the Hamptons should strongly rebound .
“ The ramifications of the global financial crisis have not been completed understood or qualified yet and it will take time to understand just what it will do to us out here , ” Turino said .
But , as in the wider real estate market , potential home buyers in the Hamptons have no incentive to buy right now , when home prices widely expected to keep tumbling well into next year .
Eric Ellenbogen , co-founder of media company Boomerang Media TV , put his $ 5.695 million second home in East Hampton up for sale six months ago .
“ There have been many lookers , but no offers , ” he said .
The number of lookers has diminished in a more pronounced way in the last several weeks due to uncertainty about the overall housing market , financial markets and the availability of financing , he said .
But , he said , patience is a virtue .
“ I am not a forced seller as so many home owners are right now , so I plan on riding this out and if I do not get an offer I can always turn my house into a summer rental , ” he said .
Despite more available houses , summer rental prices , which can range broadly from $ 12,000 to $ 1 million for the season , seem to be holding steady , according to Corcoran Group ’s Saatchi .
But this is not a good sign for sales , which typically rebound in the spring but may not this year because would - be buyers may have decided to rent instead .
“ This upcoming summer season will be all about renting , ” Saatchi said .
Then there is the matter of potential recrimination — from siblings , parents and children who share half of the participants ’ genes and did not necessarily agree to display them in public .
Prospective participants are advised to consult with first - degree relatives , but except for identical twins , their consent is not required .
Some volunteers are worried about their hurting their teenagers ’ dating prospects .
“ A potential boyfriend could look at my genome and say , ‘ I do n’t know if this relationship is meant to be , ’ ” said John Halamka , a participant and the chief information officer of Harvard Medical School , who has a 15 - year - old daughter .
( His daughter , he said , told him that if a suitor did that , “ I would n’t want them as a boyfriend anyway . ” )
Because of the known and unknown risks , Dr. Church required the first 10 participants to demonstrate the equivalent of a master ’s degree in genetics .
Most are either investors or executives in the biomedical industry , or else teach or write about it , so they may have a financial interest in encouraging people to part with their genetic privacy .
The project has drawn criticism from scientists and bioethicists who caution that even its highly educated volunteers cannot understand the practical and psychological risks of disclosing information long regarded as quintessentially private .
“ I ’m concerned that this could make it seem easy and cool to put your information out there when there is still a lot of stigma associated with certain genetic traits , ” said Kathy Hudson , director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University .
“ There will be new uses of this data that people ca n’t anticipate — and they ca n’t do anything to get it back . ”
For now , the PGP , which is privately funded , is sequencing only the fraction of participants ’ genomes thought to have the most influence over disease , behavior and physical traits .
But the question of how much value to place on genetic privacy has taken on more urgency as the technology for sequencing an entire human genome accelerated and the price has plummeted to as low as $ 5,000 , so that it may soon be possible for everyone to possess their own genetic readout .
“ The Taiwan Strait continues to narrow , ” said The Japan Times in an editorial .
Last week , Taiwan hosted its highest - level meeting with mainland China since the two split in a 1949 civil war .
Such bridge - building is great for “ peace and stability in the region , ” but it would have been “ unthinkable ” before March , when Taiwanese President Ma Ying - jeou defeated President Chen Shui-bian of the “ independence - minded Democratic Progressive Party , ” whom China shunned .
That ’s nonsense , said Jerome Keating in the Taipei Times .
Most of agreements China and Ma ’s government signed last week were fashioned under Chen .
Nothing historic happened except that “ an arrogant , low - level Chinese official deigned to visit Taiwan ” — and was met with huge , angry protests that the incompetent Ma should have foreseen and defused .
Well , Chen at least “ made history ” this week , said Natalie Tso in Time online , becoming the first ex-president sent to jail in Taiwan .
The first - ever DPP president and “ a symbol of the Taiwanese independence movement , ” Chen says Ma arrested him to “ appease China ” and improve cross - strait relations , but even some former supporters accept the financial corruption charges against him .
Yes , Chen is a “ hopeless miscreant ” and a “ confessed tax evader , ” said Michael Turton in The View from Taiwan , but this is still a “ political prosecution . ”
Nine DPP politicians are being held under sometimes sketchy circumstances , and despite prosecutors ’ claims , not all of them are involved in the Chen case .

President elect Barack Obama made choices today for “ a broad and diverse team ” in Chicago , reports the Associated Press .
Hillary Clinton , Robert Gates , former Gen. James Jones , Eric Holder , Janet Napolitano , and Susan Rice “ round ” out this “ change ” team which is , of course , not change but a seamless transition between the Bush neocons and Obama ’s decidedly neoliberal choices .
Obama announces Hillary Clinton as his Secretary of State .
Consider the following uncomfortable facts that the corporate media will never tell you in a month of Sundays :
Hillary Clinton : As Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton will continue the Bush - Clinton legacy of mass murder and “ humanitarian ” interventions in “ failed states , ” that is to say states not toting the New World Order party line .
Clinton wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations publication Foreign Affairs that ending “ the war in Iraq is the first step toward restoring the United States ’ global leadership , ” never mind her 2002 Senate vote allowing Bush and the neocons to invade Iraq and subsequently slaughter over a million Iraqis .
Clinton , as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , has stated she wants to send more troops into the Afghan meat grinder and have them chase the CIA - created Taliban and al - Qaeda around .
Afghanistan needs to get “ as much , if not more attention ” than Iraq , said Clinton earlier this year on a campaign stop in Cape Fear , North Carolina , an appropriately named venue .
“ The next president will be the first to inherit two wars , a long - term campaign against global terrorist networks , and growing tension with Iran as it seeks to acquire nuclear weapons .
The United States will face a resurgent Russia whose future orientation is uncertain and a rapidly growing China that must be integrated into the international system , ” Clinton wrote for the CFR .
In other words , the wars will continue , Iran will be “ confronted ” ( bombed into submission ) , and Russia and China forced into the “ international system , ” in other words the bankster system that thrives on looting and imposed debt misery .
Clinton , as Secretary of State , will continue the phony GWOT indefinitely .
“ It is essential that we win this war against these borderless terrorists , but it is , I believe , critical that we once again recommit ourselves to that American internationalism that I mentioned in the beginning , ” Clinton told Richard Haass and the Council on Foreign Relations in 2003 .
Internationalism , of course , is inseparable from neoliberal globalism of the sort the CFR has pushed for decades .
Robert Gates :
More than anything , keeping Robert Gates on at the Pentagon is a signal to the plebs that the neocon policies of the Bush administration will stay in effect , albeit with a few minor changes and a lot of window dressing .
Gates is a loyal Bush senior stooge .
During Bush 41 ’s presidency , Gates served as deputy national security adviser and then as CIA director .
He was dean of the Bush School and then president of Texas A&M , which is where the Bush presidential library is located .
“ In other words , Bob Gates is a Bush 41 kinda guy , ” writes Ivo Daalder .
Robert Gates is a consummate insider .
“ Gates indeed worked under every U.S. president from Richard M. Nixon to George Herbert Walker Bush , ” notes the National Security Archive .
He is closely connected to former Secretary of State James Baker III , a prominent CFR member and Bush crime family functionary and consigliere .
“ The Iran Contra affair in which Robert Gates was implicated was part of the architecture of the ‘ war on terrorism ’ .
What is rarely acknowledged is that part of the proceeds of the illegal weapons sales to Iran were also used to finance the CIA sponsored Islamic brigades ( i.e. Al Qaeda ) involved in the Soviet - Afghan war .
These covert operations in support of Al Qaeda paved the way for the ‘ war on terrorism ’ which constitutes the cornerstone of US National Security doctrine , ” writes Michel Chossudovsky .
As Obama ’s Secretary of Defense , Robert Gates will oversee the military aspects of this doctrine with an invasion of Pakistan and further involvement in Afghanistan .
Gen. James Jones : Former Marine general and former NATO supreme commander James Jones will be Obama ’s National Security Advisor .
Jones sits on the board of directors of the Boeing Company , Chevron , and NATO ’s Atlantic Council of the United States .
Jones is cozy with the Council on Foreign Relations .
He is reportedly a good friend of John McCain and is respected by Republicans .
Eric Holder and Janet Napolitano .
In essence , Jones will serve as Big Oil ’s security chief .
“ Jones is currently a director of Chevron Oil .
He also heads of the Chamber of Commerce ’s Institute for 21st Century Energy — a group lobbying on energy issues in DC and described by the Grist as ‘ part of the Republican machine , dominated by — and lobbying fiercely for the interests of — Big Oil , Big Auto , Big Pharma , and other such Bigs , ' ” writes Mitchell Anderson .
“ Jones would be reflective of two huge Obama priorities , ” notes Spencer Ackerman .
“ First , Afghanistan .
As NATO Commander , Jones ceaselessly lobbied the European allies for greater assistance in the Afghanistan war .
Second , energy security .
Jones is widely known to be an advocate of alternative energy sources , and , as Politico notes , chairs an energy task force for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
And of course there ’s the good optics of such a well - respected general being Obama ’s closest White House aide on foreign policy . ”
Incidentally , even though former Sec. Def. Rumsfeld exiled Jones to his mostly ceremonial NATO post , the general is onboard with the coming attack against Pakistan and possibly Iran .
During a September , 2006 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing , Jones testified that it was “ generally accepted ” that Taliban leaders operated out Quetta , Pakistan .
Finally , Jones “ has pointed to Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo as a ‘ model ’ for US bases elsewhere , ” writes Chad Nagle .
“ Anyone who has seen the gigantic and ominous Bondsteel , set amid the wasteland of bombed out and destitute Kosovo , has an idea of what the US - imposed New World Order will look like – destroyed dumps where a fortress houses thousands of American military personnel behind its walls and the fearful population outside can rot in hell .
It was , of course , the husband of Obama ’s choice for Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , that turned Kosovo and the former Yugoslavia into a wasteland .
An Obama administration promises more of the same .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Eric Holder : Former Clintonite and Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder will be Obama ’s attorney general .
Holder is probably best and infamously remembered for his role in the controversial pardon of billionaire fugitive Marc Rich , the FBI Most Wanted criminal who colluded with Iran at a time when that country was holding U.S. hostages .
In private practice as an attorney , Holder represents Merck and helped negotiate an agreement with the Justice Department for Chiquita Brands International in a case that involved Chiquita ’s payment of “ protection money ” to the United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia , a group on the U.S. government ’s list of terrorist organizations .
Most disturbing , however , is the role Holder played in the D.C. v. Heller ruling on handguns .
Holder joined the Reno - led amicus brief , which urged the Supreme Court to uphold Washington , D.C. ’s handgun ban and said the Department of Justice from Franklin Roosevelt through Bill Clinton had always believed that the Second Amendment does not protect the rights of individuals to own guns for personal use .
In short , Holder is a gun grabber who is opposed to the Second Amendment .
As attorney general , we can bet he will work tirelessly to outlaw all firearms in the United States .
Finally , Holder has advocated government censorship of the internet .
“ It is gonna be a difficult thing , but it seems to me that if we can come up with reasonable restrictions , reasonable regulations in how people interact on the Internet , that is something that the Supreme Court and the courts ought to favorably look at , ” Holder told NPR after the Columbine massacre in 1999 .
Janet Napolitano : Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano will be Obama ’s Homeland Security secretary .
She will continue the do - nothing approach to illegal immigration .
“ Far from being a border hawk , Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano frequently blocked efforts to curb illegal immigration , say enforcement advocates concerned about her expected nomination to be the Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama , ” reports Fred Lucas for CNS News .
She opposes a border fence and favors a controversial technology visa program and favors a “ stringent pathway to citizenship , ” in other words allowing millions of illegal aliens to become citizens .
As a CFR member , Napolitano is onboard with the globalist agenda to impoverish the American worker .
She has proposed endless H - 1B visas in order to displace skilled workers .
“ I ’m going to direct the Secretary of Labor to tell us what our labor market needs are , and we ’re going to adjust the visas accordingly , and we ’re going to put in place a process to do that , protecting jobs for American workers but realizing that we will have a national labor shortage moving forward .
I ’m going to pay specific attention to certain areas such as H - 1B visas [ for skilled workers ] , where there is such a demonstrated need and there ’s more than enough work for everyone to go around , ” Donald A. Collins quotes her as declaring .
Susan E. Rice : Ms. Rice , a former assistant secretary of state for African Affairs under Clinton and a Rhodes scholar , is a minion of the Brooking Institution .
Brookings is a neolib “ think tank ” par excellence .
It is funded by the Ford Foundation , the John D. & Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation , the Rockefeller Foundation , American Express , the Bank of America , Lockheed Martin , Walmart , Goldman Sachs , and the United Nations .
Rice , who the neocons consider a “ leftist , ” is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aspen Strategy Group , the latter where she rubs elbows with the likes of Brent Scowcroft , the neocon Eliot A. Cohen ( a “ leading champion ” of the war in Iraq ) , Madeleine Albright ( a proponent of mass murdering Iraqi children ) , CFR president Richard N. Haass , and other crossover neocons and neolibs .

Here are new photos from London set of ‘s “ ” where you can seeas Dr. Watson .
After the first pictures of .
as Sherlock Holmes , take a look at these where he actually looks like real Holmes .
We ’ve long feared that the integrity of medical research is being eroded by conflicts of interest and manipulation of scientific data .
Still , it was disheartening to learn that one of the nation ’s most prominent psychiatrists has taken large , undisclosed payments from a drug company whose products he evaluated and that another company manipulated studies to make a drug look far more beneficial than it actually is .
As Gardiner Harris reported in The Times , Congressional investigators found that Dr. Charles Nemeroff of Emory University  the principal investigator on a government - financed study of antidepressant drugs made by GlaxoSmithKline  repeatedly promised to keep his consulting fees from Glaxo below $ 10,000 a year in compliance with federal and university conflict - of - interest rules .
He took far more than that , mostly for giving talks promoting the company ’s drugs to other doctors .
All told , according to Senator Charles Grassley , who has spearheaded the inquiry , Dr. Nemeroff failed to report some half - a- million dollars in fees and expenses from Glaxo while he led the study .
Dr. Nemeroff has declined to comment beyond assuring Emory that he followed university disclosure regulations “ to the best of my knowledge . ”
The university is investigating .
But the Congressional investigation was based on reports from drug companies on their payments to Dr. Nemeroff .

Die Trainersuche beim FC Schalke 04 ist nach der Trennung von David Wagner am vergangenen Sonntag in vollem Gange .
Viele Namen wurden bisher gehandelt .
Während am Dienstag die beiden Athletiktrainer Werner Leuthard und Quirin Löppert das Training leiteten , arbeitete Schalkes Sportvorstand Jochen Schneider derweil in seinem Büro an der optimalen Nachfolge - Regelung .
SPORT1 gibt einen Überblick über die Trainersuche in Gelsenkirchen - aktuell kristallisieren sich nur noch zwei Namen als Kandidaten heraus .
Manuel Baum : Der frühere Augsburg - Coach , der aktuell die U20 beim DFB trainiert , gilt als absoluter Taktik - Experte .
Dass Schalke den 43 - Jährigen auf der Liste hat , deckt sich auch mit SPORT1 - Informationen .
Werde Deutschlands Tippkönig !
Jetzt zum SPORT1 Tippspiel anmeldenBaum erlebte Schalkes 1:3 - Niederlage gegen Werder Bremen auf der Tribüne und beobachtete vorher ein Spiel des Schalker Nachwuchses .
Unter der Woche führten die Schalker Verantwortlichen zudem schon Gespräche mit Baum .
Auf Schalke glaubt die Führungsriege um Schneider , dass nach David Wagner ein Taktiker her muss , der der Mannschaft das nötige Rüstzeug gibt , um aus der sportlichen Krise rauszukommen .
Bei Baum ist allerdings nicht jeder im Aufsichtsrat vollends davon überzeugt , dass er die Kabine in den Griff bekommt .
Als abschreckendes Beispiel gilt der Fall Martin Hinteregger in Augsburg .
Dafür ist man von seiner taktischen Finesse absolut angetan .
Dimitrios Grammozis : Auch der frühere Darmstadt - Trainer , der als Profi unter anderem für den Hamburger SV , den 1 .
FC Kaiserslautern sowie beim 1 . FC
Köln spielte und in der Vorsaison als Trainer bei Darmstadt 98 tätig war , steht ebenfalls auf Schalkes Short - List .
Obwohl Grammozis nicht Baums Taktik - Repertoire aufweist , ist man auf Schalke von seiner Art angetan .
Er könne in einer Mannschaft Feuer entfachen .
Was zudem für Grammozis sprechen würde : Der Deutsch - Grieche hat eine bisher unbelastete Karriere .
Seine Trainerkarriere startete Grammozis 2013 beim VfL Bochum .
An der Castroper Straße arbeitete er in verschiedenen Funktionen und konnte vor allem im Jugendbereich ausgiebige Erfahrungen sammeln .
SPORT1 erreichte den 42 - Jährigen am Dienstagmittag .
Er wollte sich allerdings nicht zu den laufenden Spekulationen äußern .
Mark van Bommel : Zuletzt tauchte auch der Name Mark van Bommel ( 43 ) bei der Trainersuche auf .
Der Niederländer und frühere Bayern - Profi ( 2006 bis 2011 ) wurde im Dezember 2019 bei der PSV Eindhoven entlassen , seitdem ist er ohne Job .
Schalkes Aufsichtsrat Huub Stevens dementiert , dass der frühere Münchner für die Königsblauen tätig wird .
" Wir haben über verschiedene Kandidaten gesprochen , aber Mark van Bommel war da nicht dabei " , sagte Stevens bei Fox Sports .
" Ich denke auch nicht , dass van Bommel in das Profil passt , das wir suchen .
Ich denke , er kennt die Bundesliga nicht gut genug . "
Kein Kandidat ist auch Ralf Rangnick , der noch am Sonntag bei
Sky nicht abgeneigt schien .
Inzwischen hat der 62 - Jährige allerdings bei Funke Sport erklärt , dass ein Engagement aktuell ausgeschlossen sei : " Ich kann mir zurzeit überhaupt nicht vorstellen , ein drittes Mal zu Schalke 04 zu kommen , und schon gar nicht als Trainer , der kurzfristig die Negativserie beenden soll . "
Fazit : Zwischen Baum und Grammozis wird am Ende die Wahl fallen , wobei der frühere FCA - Coach leicht favorisiert ist .
Bis spätestens Freitag soll entschieden werden .
Mr. Farber said that mass production and improved manufacturing techniques had pushed prices down , and estimated that photovoltaic technology now costs one and a half to four times as much as conventional power sources when costs are spread over time .
But the cost can be lower than that of electricity from conventional sources in areas with high power bills and government subsidies for the use of alternative energy .
Glenn Hamer , executive director of the Solar Energy Industries Association , said that the leaky water heaters that tainted the industry had been driven from the market .
A slow but steady resurgence of solar technology has taken place in the last two decades .
In 1982 , the year the government 's Energy Information Administration started tracking shipments of PV modules , about 7,000 peak kilowatts ( the measure used by photovoltaic companies ) were shipped to purchasers in the United States .
In 2001 , about five times that many -- 36,000 -- were shipped .
Across the country , and particularly in California , where energy costs have spiked , more solar roofs are being installed each year .
Some are generating a surplus of electricity that can be sold to the electric companies .
'' It 's starting to get very exciting , '' said Steven J. Strong , the solar designer who guided the White House project and whose company , Solar Design Associates , has been advocating the technology since the 1970's .
'' We 're busier than ever . ''
At the same time , solar thermal systems for heating water have become almost commonplace for new pools , said Maureen McIntyre , editor of Solar Today , a monthly magazine .
'' We now have solar hot water systems that are mature and affordably priced and make sense , '' she said .
Still , solar power makes up only 1 percent of the total energy generated in the United States , according to Mr. Hamer of the industries association .
It was the members of the TMRC who defined a hack as " a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill some constructive goal , but with some wild pleasure taken in mere involvement , " and devised a code of honour which Steven Levy later defined as The Hacker Ethic :
According to legend , this is where the traditions of hacking which later gave rise to the free software movement began .
In 1961 , members of the TMRC also known as The Midnight Requisition Committee discovered a TX - 0 computer in Building 26 at MIT .
As Steven Levy tells it in Hackers : Heroes of the Computer Revolution , worked out that the best time to gain access was in the middle of the night : " when no person in his right mind would have signed up for an hour - long session on the piece of paper posted every Friday beside the air conditioner in the RLE lab ...
The TMRC hackers , who soon were referring to themselves as TX - 0 hackers , changed their life - style to accommodate the computer . "
Tradition has it the origins of the free software movement can be traced back to the hackers of the Signals and Power Subcommittee of the Tech Model Railroad Club ( TMRC ) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in the late 50s and early 60s .
- Access to computers and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works should be unlimited and total .
Always yield to the Hands - on Imperative !
- All information should be free ;
- Mistrust authority , promote decentralization ;
- Hackers should be judged by their hacking , not bogus criteria such as degrees , age , race or position ;
- You can create art and beauty on a computer ;
- Computers can change your life for the better .
As the history page on the TMRC website recounts : " Experiments with MIT 's DEC and Lincoln machines , and employment at DEC and at the AI Lab were not , of course , the limit of TMRC 's involvement with computers .
Early DEC computers soon found their way into TMRC .
They were used to control routes in the freight yard and to throw switches on the main layout .
TMRC was probably one of the first student activities to make use of computers .
However , in each application , cost and electrical component limits dictated that elaborate relay interfaces connect each computer to the layout . "
Intellectual Property is theft ?
Fast forward to the present day , or at least to 2001 .
Bob Jacobsen , a model railway enthusiast based in California , set up a project known as JMRI to create a Java - based Digital Command & Control ( DCC ) system to automatically control model railway layouts from a home computer much like those devised in earlier years by the TMRC .
DCC allows you to control each locomotive on the track as though you were driving it from the cab .
Each locomotive is equipped with a chip , which translates the signals sent from the command station , or computer , via the track .
The system also controls the signals and points or turnouts and may be implemented with various degrees of sophistication .
There are a number of such systems on the market , and searching around the web will turn up many more built by hobbyists and enthusiasts to run from their home PCs , on everything from DOS to Linux .
The difference is that Jacobsen 's system is an open source project hosted on sourceforge.net and released under the Artistic License , as used by Perl .
( JMRI is currently licensed under the GPLv2 . )

Make Over Your iPod , Archos , iRiver or Sandisk with Rockbox
It 's hard to look at the current generation of media players and not admire their diverse capabilities and extensible software platforms .
That 's not to say that your 5th - gen iPod does n't play back music perfectly well , or that your iRiver H10 still is n't a kickass media player , but they do feel a bit dated .
Rockbox replaces your MP3 player 's operating system with something more substantial , effectively making it a completely new device .
You get endless codec support , advanced audio options , dozens of games , useful apps like a calculator and a text editor , plus you can choose from tons of different interface skins for a unique look and feel .

Convert Your PC or Notebook Into A Much More Expensive Mac
It 's undeniable that Macs are too expensive .
For many , they are considered a luxury item whose added cost does n't justify the benefit .
Luckily Apple 's switch to an Intel platform opened up a world of unauthorized OS X installations which can turn your existing PC into a powerhouse Mac Pro workstation , or morph your MSI Wind or Asus EeePC into the Mac netbook that should be in their goddamn product line anyway .
Check the hardware compatibility list to see if your PC is eligible for the upgrade .

Difficulty : Moderate to Hard .
If you 're not morally opposed to downloading iATKOS and Kalyway , which are pre-patched Leopard install DVDs ( this is bit torrent territory ) , then the process is much like installing any other OS .
If you insist on building your own patched install from a DVD you own , then , well , good luck .
Always check hardware lists first , though , because driver support is everything .

Flash Your Crappy Router Into a Top - Line Piece of Hardware
The DD - WRT project exists for a simple reason :
Most routers are physically very similar , but are priced differently because of functionality derived from software .
The DD - WRT firmware unlocks the potential of the most basic routers out there - too many to name but damn if yours is n't on the list .
As it turns out , your budget model is kind of impressive : Program - specific traffic throttling , professional level wireless security and radical signal boosting are just a few of the dozens of new features that can be enabled .
Advertisement
Difficulty : Easy .
If you can't manage this one , then you do n't deserve a router - installation just takes a few clicks on the device 's default configuration pages .
A word of caution , though : Make sure your router configuration page is totally compatible with your browser before the operation , as some choke on Firefox and can botch firmware upgrades .
Stick to IE if you have the choice .

Download Updated Maps For Your Old GPS
I 'm referring of course to capital ' D ' downloading here , mainly because at the moment GPS map updates are a racket .
You could spend hundreds of dollars on map data that is freely available on Google Maps , Microsoft Live and MapQuest , among others , or you can just , you know , not .
Map packs for Garmin , TomTom and Magellan units are floating around torrent sites and usually do n't require much more than a simple CD image mount and run routine to set up .
( Guilty conscience sold separately . )
Difficulty : Easy to Moderate .
If you 're just running a copy of a CD , then you 'll be able to use the installation wizards .
Some more involved methods for Windows CE - based devices require some SSH file transfers , but these are relatively rare .

Jailbreak Your iPhone for Wi -Fi Internet Tethering
Two internet plans are enough , but to sign on to a mobile internet contract when you 've already got unlimited iPhone data feels kind of stupid .
Jailbreaking your iPhone is now about as easy as performing a firmware upgrade , and there are actually multiple tethering apps .
PDANet and iPhoneModem both work a treat , but keep in mind that excessive usage could draw AT&T 's attention and ire : Tethering is not allowed on the data plan , even though it works fine .
Both apps are available in Cydia , where you can also find a limited assortment of other apps that do n't have a place in the app store .
Advertisement
Difficulty : Moderate .
Jailbreaking can be managed through the Dev Team 's fantastic Quickpwn tool , but it does take a few minutes and can go wrong if instructions are n't followed closely .
After jailbreak , Cydia and Installer fill the role of the gray - market app store , functioning as simple package managers that are arguably as polished as their more legitimate younger brother .

PDANet and iPhoneModem take different approaches to tethering , but neither requires more networking expertise than it would take to , say , set up a router .

Turn Your Wii Into a Free Emulation Machine
It 's more than a little infuriating to have to repurchase your childhood library of console games from the Virtual Console , especially when free PC emulators and accompanying ROMs abound on the old intertubes .
All you need is a copy of Legend of Zelda : The Twilight Princess , an SD card and an SD reader and you 're ready to install A Boy and His Blob : Trouble on Blobolonia , which is pretty much all anyone has ever really needed since this whole " Video Gaming Television Machine " thing got under way in the first place .
Throw in extended media playback and some helpful widgets for an extra value - add .
Difficulty : Moderate .
This is one of the only hacks here that needs additional hardware to work , even if it 's basic .
The good news is that once you find a copy of Zelda and load up your SD card , the process pretty much takes care of itself .
Further app installs are taken care of through a intuitive dedicated channel .

OTTAWA — Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to visit Gov. - Gen. Michaelle Jean tomorrow morning to ask her to halt Parliament temporarily or allow a snap election to be held .
A spokesperson for Harper suggested this afternoon that the prime minister would take action early tomorrow to break the current deadlock in the House of Commons .
His most likely request is to ask Jean to suspend Parliament until January , at which time the Conservatives would bring down a budget containing an economic stimulus package .
Harper , meantime , will deliver a televised address to the nation tonight .
Officials have confirmed that the prime minister has asked the television networks to let him appear at 7 p.m .
The coalition will ask for equal time in order for Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion to respond , a Liberal official said .
Kory Teneycke , Harper 's director of communications , confirmed that the prime minister would make a statement , but said the 10 - minute speech , in French and English , would be taped , not live .
Emerging from a morning Conservative caucus meeting , he said Harper had not scheduled a meeting with Jean " at this time . "
She returned home from Europe this afternoon and would have to approve any request from Harper to discontinue Parliament and avoid his government 's defeat next week .
Late today , Harper said he has invited the provincial and territorial premiers to a January meeting to discuss ways their governments can cooperate in dealing with the economic crisis .
" My DNA would never allow me to do a deal with the socialists and my heart would never allow me to do a deal with the separatists , " Day said , claiming he never saw or heard about the document until last night .
Day dared the Bloc to repeat its allegations outside the House , where MPs are not protected against accusations of libel by privilege .
The Globe and Mail reported today that the 2000 offer of a deal between Day , PC and Bloc officials was proposed in a letter sent by Calgary lawyer Gerry Chipeur .
The newspaper quoted prominent sovereigntist lawyer Eric Bédard as the person who received the proposal .
A Bloc official then handed out a copy of a Globe and Mail article from July , 29 , 2000 that said Day , then Canadian Alliance leader , reefused to rule out forming a coalition with the BQ .
Some of the NDP and Liberal MPs levelled their attacks at Harper personally , calling him a demagogue and the source of the bitterness that has led Parliament to its constitutional crisis .
“ The prime minister is the problem , ” Liberal MP Denis Coderre ( Bourassa ) told reporters .
“ He is more interested in his own little power trip . ”
Coderre said Harper has been talking from both sides of his mouth , one moment saying he wanted to work with the three opposition parties to tackle the economic crisis and then the next trying to bankrupt parties by withdrawing public funding .
Liberal MP Gerard Kennedy ( Parkdale - High Park ) said the prime minister has turned into the “ a demagogue and is hiding behind the Canadian flag but will not focus . . . on the needs of the country . ”
Meanwhile , there were signs this morning that the Liberals may be willing to entertain other options besides defeating the government and replacing it with a coalition .
Arriving to the weekly caucus meeting , Liberal MP Keith Martin said it was not too late for Harper to reach across the aisle and work with them .
But Liberal MP Martha Hall Findlay said it would be too difficult to negotiate with Harper at this point .
" Negotiations with someone we can't trust are not going to be terribly productive , " she said .
After being pressed for a straight answer over whether the Harper government must end now , Hall Findlay said : " Yes .
Yes it should be , " although she added she could not know which path the Governor General would take .
When asked whether there was any room to negotiate with Harper , Liberal MP Ujal Dosanjh said he could not be trusted .
" As far as I 'm concerned , the fact is that we can't trust the prime minister .
But instead of attempting to incite a national unity crisis as he tried to do so vulgarly , he should be offering an economic stimulus package for the country , " he said .
" He could be more constructive , rather than branding people essentially as unpatriotic . "
Windsor NDP MP
Joe Comartin said the coalition is prepared to bring down the Conservative government even before the Conservatives get to deliver a budget .
Comartin said that scenario would play out if the government is successful in convincing the Governor General to prorogue Parliament .
The Conservatives are hoping the several week break over Christmas would give them time to whip up public support and allow them to return with a new throne speech followed closely by a budget .
But opposition critics accuse the government of stalling the inevitable .
" The first confidence vote wo n't be on the budget , the first confidence vote will be on the throne speech .
Everyone I talk to from the Bloc and the Liberals say they are prepared to vote against the throne speech because they no longer trust Harper , " Comartin told the Star .
One Conservative MP emerged from caucus this morning wearing a button that read " coup " with a red circle and line through it .
Tory cabinet minister Jean - Pierre Blackburn said a decision on prorogation " is to come . "
The political crisis gave rise to some of the fiercest parliamentary exchanges in a decade yesterday .
Fighting for his political life , Harper has given the nod to pep rallies , an advertising blitz and speeches by ministers to sway public opinion in his favour .
Adding to the intrigue , the Bloc Québécois said it is seeking up to $ 500 million in post - secondary education transfers in the first budget of a proposed Liberal - NDP coalition government , suggesting that — while it has pledged to support the coalition — it wo n't be a silent backer .
The prime minister led the way yesterday in calling the proposed coalition that wants to replace him " undemocratic " and a threat to national unity .
He derided it for handing the balance of power to " separatists " — an accusation his rivals mocked , citing Harper 's own government 's reliance on the Bloc Québécois to pass two budgets in the past .
Conservatives have been shocked at the speed of events , but , for now , they 're rallying behind their leader .
" A national televised address would be a great idea " for Harper , said one Conservative MP .
" Real and abject humility is an even better idea . "
However , none was in evidence from Harper — or his critics — yesterday .
In one of the most ferocious question periods since those that followed the 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum , Dion and Harper savaged each other over which leader could lay claim to a democratic mantle .
Dion , in a bid to pressure Harper into letting the non-confidence vote proceed , set the tone , throwing up Harper 's own words in May 2005 , when Harper was Opposition leader , in his face .

" The whole principle of our democracy is the government is supposed to be able to face the House of Commons any day on a vote , " Dion quoted Harper as saying .
But Harper retorted " the highest principle " of Canadian democracy is to have an elected mandate .
Dion 's pact to govern in a coalition with the " socialist " New Democrats , which would rely on support of " separatists " in the Bloc Québécois , was , Harper said , a " betrayal of the best interests of our country , and we will fight it with every means that we have . "
Dion replied that every MP " received a mandate from the Canadian people to deliver a government that will face the economic crisis .
The prime minister has failed ..
The prime minister does not have the support of the House any more . "
" If the leader of the Opposition thinks he has support for this , he should have the confidence to take this to the people of Canada who will reject it , " Harper said .
Conservative members jumped to their feet often to cheer Harper .
The prime minister falsely claimed that Dion , NDP Leader Jack Layton and Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe , who signed an agreement on Monday in front of TV cameras , were too afraid to do so with the Canadian flag behind them " because a member of their coalition does not even believe in the country . "
Pictures of the event clearly show two Canadian flags , as well as the flags of every province and territory .
An impassioned Dion pointed a finger across the aisle and rebutted Harper 's charge that the agreement with the Bloc to support the NDP - Liberal coalition for 18 months would hand over extraordinary powers and divide the country .
" I 've given my life for the unity of this country , for my love of Canada .
With this agreement , the Bloc accepted to have 18 months of political stability in Canada .
That 's what Canada got out of this accord . "
Harper challenged Dion that " if he believes in the country , he will walk away from this document and admit it is the worst mistake the Liberal party has ever made in its history . "
Conservative cabinet ministers later took their turns endorsing Harper and slamming Dion for his alliance with the Bloc , with Transport Minister John Baird charging that the Liberals were " getting into bed with Quebec separatists . "
But Harper 's line of attack opened him up to further criticism that he is needlessly escalating the crisis .
" The prime minister should not be making it a national unity crisis , " Layton said .
Dion argued later that the coalition will bring 18 months of political stability and suggested it might help reconcile Quebec separatists .
Duceppe mocked Harper as hypocritical , saying the Tory leader was happy to work with the Bloc in the past : " Let 's say he had a lot less fear of the nasty separatists back then . "
Bloc House leader Pierre Paquette said yesterday the party is asking to see $ 400 million to $ 500 million of $ 820 million it says Quebec is owed in postsecondary education transfer payments in the coalition government 's first budget .
Paquette told La Presse 's Malorie Beauchemin that the Bloc received a favourable initial response from the other two parties .
He added the Bloc would ensure the coalition government respects federal spending jurisdiction or gives Quebec the right to withdraw from programs with full compensation .
The coalition came together last week over the opposition parties ' rejection of Finance Minister Jim Flaherty 's economic policy statement .
That statement contained little in the way of economic stimulus but proposed to take away the rights of federal workers to strike , clamp down on pay equity and , critically , eliminate public subsidies for political parties .
While the Conservatives have been forced to backpedal on some of the measures , it has n't been enough to placate opposition MPs .
Meanwhile , some Conservative stalwarts from the West spoke out , saying the government was not blameless in the political crisis .
Deborah Grey , a former Canadian Alliance and Reform MP , urged Harper to say on national television that he'd made a mistake with the economic statement , and shift the focus back to the economy .
Former Reform leader Preston Manning warned the crisis threatens the economy , but he admitted that Harper 's inclusion of cuts to subsidies for political parties in the economic update " may have been a factor " in precipitating the crisis .
The Conservatives started their offensive early yesterday , when a senior aide to Harper gathered reporters to denounce the coalition as " unprecedented " and " undemocratic " while vowing to fight the political move by " every legal means . "
" What do I mean by every legal means available ?
Things like this , " the aide said , putting a bullhorn on the table .
He said the party would be organizing rallies , online petitions and ramping up the Conservative advertising machine .
But pro-coalition forces are moving forward with their own strategies to swing public opinion in their favour , including a rally on Parliament Hill tomorrow .
Eighteen groups , including the 3.1 million - member Canadian Labour Congress , are supporting the coalition , as is Green Leader Elizabeth May .

Anyways , the libtards were saying that McCain , bringing Joe the Plumber into the debate was going to kill McCain ’s campaign .
This is one more proof they have no idea what they are talking about .
One of the things I say to drive the Libtards nuts is say that we should increase aid to Israel .
Which I believe we should do , but they ca n’t even discuss the issue rationally .

Flag variables in Bourne shell programs
Who the heck still programs in Bourne shell ?
Old farts like me , occasionally .
Of course , almost every time I do I ask myself why I did n't write it in Perl .
Well , maybe this will be of some value to some fart even older than me ..
Suppose you want to set a flag variable , and then later you want to test it .
You probably do something like this : if some condition ; then IS_NAKED=1 fi ... if [ " $ IS_NAKED " == " 1 " ] ; then flag is set else flag is not set fi Or maybe you use $ {IS_NAKED :- 0} or some such instead of " $ IN_NAKED " .
Whatever .
Today I invented a different technique .
Try this on instead : IS_NAKED =false if some condition ; then IS_NAKED=true fi ... if $ IS_NAKED ; then flag is set else flag is not set fi The arguments both for and against it seem to be obvious , so I wo n't make them .
I have never seen this done before , but , as I concluded and R.J.B.
Signes independently agreed , it is obvious once you see it .

The United States is to deploy up to 30,000 more troops in Afghanistan by next summer .
The figure - a third more than had been anticipated - was announced by the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , and represents the highest figure mentioned publicly by a senior American official .
The confirmation of the scale of the troop surge - along with the increase in the upper limit of envisioned new forces - reflects concern over the course of the war in Afghanistan , which has been hit by numerous setbacks as security across the country has deteriorated in the face of Taliban advances .
In recent weeks Taliban attacks have severely disrupted the main supply line for US and Nato troops into the country from Pakistan , a route that carries up to 75 % of supplies to foreign forces .
Washington is already sending some 3,000 extra troops to Afghanistan in January and another 2,800 by spring .
However , previously officials have said that the number would be increased by 20,000 in the next 12 to 18 months , once approved by the new administration of President Barack Obama .
The increased scale of the commitment of US combat troops is bound to bring renewed pressure on the UK and other Nato partners to commit more troops : senior US military figures and officials have complained that America is shouldering too much of the burden in the war against the Taliban .
Last week prime minister Gordon Brown announced an extra 300 British troops for Helmand province after visiting troops in Afghanistan .
Senior Downing Street sources then played down the prospect of further reinforcements this spring .
However , Brown will be under pressure not to jeopardise a fledgling relationship with Obama if the new US president requests more British troops .
" Some 20 to 30,000 is the window of overall increase from where we are right now .
I do n't have an exact number , " Mullen told reporters .
" We 've agreed on the requirement and so it 's clear to me that we 're going to fill that requirement .
So , it 's not a matter of if , but when , " he said .
' We 're looking to get them here in the spring , but certainly by the beginning of summer at the latest . "
Half of the new US troops are expected to be deployed to southern Afghanistan , where British forces are stationed .
US Army General David McKiernan has asked for the extra troops to halt a growing Taliban insurgency , particularly in the east and south of Afghanistan .
Obama has pledged a renewed focus on Afghanistan , where US - led forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001 after the 11 September terror attacks .
The United States currently has some 31,000 troops in Afghanistan , with some operating independently and others operating as part of a 51,000 - strong Nato - led security assistance force .
Clogged arteries can cause angina People who scrimp on sleep are more likely to develop hardening of their arteries , a precursor to heart disease , research suggests .
Calcified arteries were found in nearly a third of people who slept fewer than five hours a night .
This dropped to around one in 10 for those who slept an extra hour , the Journal of the American Medical Association study of 495 adults found .
Experts said getting enough sleep was important for good heart health .
In the study , the volunteers underwent two CT scans , designed to assess the build - up of calcium in the heart 's arteries , five years apart .
Although this single study does not prove that short sleep leads to coronary artery disease , it is safe to recommend at least six hours of sleep a night
Dr Diane Lauderdale , lead researcher
They also filled out sleep questionnaires , kept a sleep diary and wore a wrist monitor for six nights that measured movement to give an estimate of how long they were actually lying still and asleep .
At the first scan , none of the volunteers had any calcification in their arteries but five years later 61 of them did .
This calcification appeared to be linked with lack of sleep .
The risk was lowest for those who regularly had more than seven hours sleep each night .
Lead researcher Dr Diane Lauderdale , of the University of Chicago , said there were several possible explanations for the link that they found .
Stress - related Firstly , there may be some factor not yet identified that can both reduce sleep duration and increase calcification .
Or it might be down to blood pressure - high blood pressure increases the likelihood of calcification and blood pressure goes down during sleep .
Alternatively , stress or a stress hormone like cortisol , which has been tied to decreased sleep and increased calcification , may play a role .
She said : " Although there are constant temptations to sleep less , there is a growing body of evidence that short sleep may have subtle health consequences .
" Although this single study does not prove that short sleep leads to coronary artery disease , it is safe to recommend at least six hours of sleep a night . "
Ellen Mason , of the British Heart Foundation , said : " It is not yet clear quite how sleep affects our heart disease risk , but this study adds to previous research suggesting that getting enough sleep may help to keep our heart and circulation healthy .
" Sleep is essential for our body 's ability to repair itself and with the party season in full flow , it is important to try and get enough rest .
" Drinking alcohol late at night and getting up early can mean we 're not getting enough quantity , or quality , of sleep . "

Whistling in the Wind
The new climate change report falls miles short of what we need .
Here are some of the emergency measures it should have contained .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 2nd December 2008 .
Lord Turner has two jobs .
The first , as chair of the Financial Services Authority , is to save capitalism .
The second , as chair of the Committee on Climate Change , is to save the biosphere from the impacts of capitalism .
I have no idea how well he is discharging the first task , but if his approach to the second one is anything to go by , you should dump your shares and buy gold .
His climate change report , published yesterday , is long , detailed and impressive ( 1 ) .
It has the admirable objective of trying to cap global warming at two degrees or a little more .
This , it says , means that greenhouse gas pollution in the UK should fall by 80 % by 2050 and by 31 % by 2020 .
But there ’s a problem .
There is no longer any likely relationship between an 80 % cut and two degrees of warming .
This gets a little complicated , but please bear with me while I explain why Turner ’s proposal is about as likely to stop runaway climate change as the Maginot Line was to hold back the Luftwaffe .
The 80 % cut he recommends for the UK more or less matches a global target of 50 % by 2050 .
A 50 % global cut , the report says , would make roughly two degrees of warming a “ central expectation ” and would reduce the probability of four degrees ( which it calls “ extremely dangerous climate change ” ) to less than 1 % ( 2 ) .
Turner claims that to keep the temperature rise close to two degrees , the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions must peak in 2016 then fall by either three or four per cent a year .
A 3 % rate of decline is most likely to deliver a temperature rise of 2.2 degrees this century ; a 4 % annual cut would produce about 2.1% ( 3 ) .
That ’s more or less consistent with his 2050 targets .
So far so good .
But a recent paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , using the same sources , comes to completely different conclusions ( 4 ) .
It agrees that to deliver a reasonable chance of preventing more than two degrees of warming , greenhouse gases in the atmosphere need to stabilise at a maximum of 450 parts per million , carbon dioxide equivalent ( ppmCO2e ) .
But it shows that to achieve this , global emissions of greenhouse gases from the parts of the system we can control need to peak by 2015 , then fall by 6 - 8 % a year between 2020 and 2040 , leading to “ full decarbonization sometime soon after 2050 . ”
Even this , it shows , relies on an optimistic reading of the current data .
Turner ’s suggested cuts are more likely to produce four degrees of warming than two degrees .
The difference between the two reports comes down to this :
Turner assumes that greenhouse gases can rise to 500 ppmCO2e before falling back to 450 ( 5 ) .
The other paper shows that this is a dangerous assumption .
Not only does this mean that the cut comes too late , but far from falling back , the enhanced levels in the atmosphere are likely to trigger more emissions , as the biosphere starts producing more greenhouse gases than it absorbs .
We cannot afford to overshoot ( 6 ) .
Last week a paper published in Geophysical Research Letters produced what could be the first hard evidence that runaway global feedback has begun ( 7 ) .
In 2007 , methane levels in the atmosphere , which had previously levelled off , began rising again .
The most likely reason is that the Siberian permafrost is melting , as a result of the runaway warming of the Arctic .
This was n’t supposed to happen for another 80 years .
The great global meltdown appears to have started , yet Turner proposes that we carry on with the old plan as if nothing has changed .
We ’re still digging trenches , even as the sky fills with bomber planes .
My reading of the new projections suggests that to play its part in preventing two degrees of global warming , the UK needs to cut greenhouse gases by roughly 25 % from current levels by the end of 2012 – a quarter in four years .
But how the heck could this be done ?
Here is a list of measures which could be enacted almost immediately .
They require no economic or technological miracles ; but they do demand that the government is brave enough to govern .
1. Immediately renegotiate the European Emissions Trading Scheme , imposing a lower cap on carbon pollution and the mandatory sale of all emissions permits to the industries covered by the scheme ( at the moment over 90 % are given away ( 8 ) ) .
2 . Use the money this raises for :
a . A crash programme for training builders .
As the major component of a green new deal , delivering jobs as well as carbon cuts , the government will immediately launch training schemes for tens of thousands of specialist builders , insulators , window - fitters , plasterers and decorators .
b. A home improvement scheme like Germany ’s , but twice as fast .
Every year between January 2010 and 2020 , 10 % of homes will be fully insulated and fitted with good windows or secondary glazing , at state expense .
Landlords will have a legal obligation to join or lose their right to take tenants .
Announce that when the scheme is complete , gas and electricity bills will be subject to an escalating tariff : the more you use , the more you will have to pay for every unit .
3 . Announce that incandescent lightbulbs will no longer be sold in the United Kingdom by next April .
Announce that no fridge or freezer with an energy rating below grade A++ and no other appliance rated below grade A will be sold from July .
4 . Increase vehicle excise duty for the most polluting cars to £ 3000 a year ( from the current £ 400 ) .
Use the money this raises to :
a. Start closing key urban streets to private cars and dedicating them to public transport and cycling .
b. Increase the public subsidy for bus and train journeys .
Oblige the bus companies to sign contracts providing a wider range of services .
Give us the integrated low - carbon transport we have long been promised , in which buses are scheduled to meet trains , trains and buses carry bicycles and safe cycle lanes connect with eachother across entire cities .
c. Train thousands of new coach drivers and public transport operators .
Create coach lanes on all the motorways and start moving coach stations from the city centres to the motorway junctions , to enable coach travel to become as fast and efficient as car travel .
Link them to city centres with dedicated bus lanes ( 9 ) .
d. Scrap the airport expansion programme .
Set a cap on the number of landing slots , which will fall every year until it reaches 5 % of current capacity .
5 . Stop the burning of moorland : because this exposes and oxidises peat , grouse shoots ( which are mostly responsible ) produce a staggering proportion of the UK ’s emissions ( 10 ) .
6 . Stop all opencast coal mining and rescind planning permission for new works .
Impose stonking taxes on the extraction of all fossil fuels .
Is this enough ?
No .
But it puts us on the right track .
It ’s all a gamble from now on : the only reliable advice is that we should n’t start from here .
But two decades of procrastination ensure that only emergency measures now have a chance of preventing a climate disaster .
What Turner ’s report – polite , measured and impressive as it is – proposes is more procrastination .

UK Hydrogen House Connected to Grid
October 13th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Hydrogen power is usually associated with vehicles , but a house in the UK is showing that there are a multitude of uses for fuel cells .
The grid - connected West Midlands home is powered by hydrogen as part of a £ 2 million University of Birmingham and Black County Housing Group ( BCHG ) project .
The grid - connected house generates all its energy from a fuel - cell unit in a shed behind the house , which converts bog - standard natural gas into hydrogen .
A 600 liter tank placed next to the fuel cell unit stores hot water , and excess electricity from the unit is sent to the grid .
The house ’s fridge - sized fuel cell unit can generate 1.5 kW of electricity and 3 kW of heat — including hot water and space heating .
Apparently , the team behind the house believes that everyone will have hydrogen fuel cell units in their homes at some point in the future .
But much more research needs to be done before fuel cells are energy and cost - efficient enough to be worth a switchover from natural gas .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode

Advertisement I'm in a simulated altitude chamber under the watchful eye of Des Connolly of QinetiQ's Human Performance division , and they 're about to suck most of the air out .
It 's all perfectly safe - for much of my simulated journey into the skies I 'll be wearing a mask that provides air , much like the one fighter pilots wear .
But for four minutes , I 'll drop that mask and see how it feels to breathe the thin air at 7,600 metres ( 25,000 feet ) .
QinetiQ carries out such tests on fighter pilots to instruct them on the effects of hypoxia , or oxygen starvation .
They also use the chamber to test life - support systems for high - flying jets such as the Typhoon , systems which are designed to whip into action in the event of sudden depressurisation .
The symptoms are mild , and they rob the mind of the ability to reason , so if it sneaks up on you , hypoxia will have you unconscious and then dead before you notice a thing .
At the altitudes that a Typhoon can fly , that time could be as little as five seconds .
Luckily , I 've got physiologist and pilot Tim D'Oyly at my side in the chamber to watch over the proceedings .
Last gasp
The problem is that there 's less oxygen at higher altitudes ( and less nitrogen and less of everything else ) .
At 5,500 metres , there is just half as much as at sea level .
There 's another competing process too ; the water vapour from moist internal tissues quickly saturates any air you breathe in .
That water exerts its own pressure , regardless of altitude , and that in turn makes it even harder for the lungs to suck precious oxygen out of the thin air .
As a result , passenger planes are kept pressurised - but only to an equivalent altitude of around 2,000 metres .
Building a plane that could maintain full , sea - level pressure inside with drastically decreased pressure outside at altitude would make them bulkier and more expensive .
Fighter pilots may have just seconds to fight off hypoxia
Which means that if you 've flown by plane , you 'll have experienced the same symptoms I did : ears popping and the need to clear them ( that sort of yawning that one does to equalise the pressure across both sides of the eardrum , I learned , is called the Frenzel manoeuvre ) .
But as the air was sucked noisily out of the chamber and we quickly ascended to an equivalent altitude of 7,600 metres ( 25,000 feet ) , I encountered first - hand experience of the ideal gas law that relates temperature , pressure , and volume : it got cold .
Once we reached cruising altitude , I dropped the mask and got immediately to work on a number of tasks as my blood used up the oxygen floating around in my blood and the tiny amount in the air .
My time without the mask on was called out in 30 - second , and then later , 15 - second intervals .
I wrote down my address , tried a spot - the - difference exercise , and was asked to remember a four - digit number .
When I started hyperventilating , my body 's attempt to take in more air , I did n't even notice .
Apparently I had taken on a sickly grey colour , as had my fingernail beds , and my blood oxygen level plummeted from 99 % before the exercise to just 61 % .
I , however , felt like I was doing pretty well .
The worst I felt was a bit of a warm flush , as if much of me was blushing .
Near the four - minute mark , I found myself literally trying to put a square peg in a round hole ; this child 's toy is a popular test of cognition in hypoxic scenarios such as this .
The result ?
My handwriting went way downhill , I did n't spot the differences very well , and only remembered two of the four digits when I was asked later .
When I put the mask back on and got my first blast of blessed pure oxygen , I had the worst case of seeing stars I 've ever experienced .
I think it safe to say that until I 've had much more training , no one should put me in the cockpit of a fighter plane .
But I 'll keep at it .

' You ca n't see your son - but can he have one of your organs ? '
How social workers left one man with a terrible moral dilemma
The letter from Hampshire Social Services was as brief as it was bewildering .
‘ Please ring me on the above number , ’ it said .
‘ I have some information that might be of interest to you . ’
This was quite an understatement , as Michael Shergold soon found .
A quietly spoken father of three , he finds that his life rarely gets more exciting than his weekly game of golf .
But when he called the social workers as requested , he was confronted with a series of astonishing facts .
They said he was the father of another child - a five - year - old son from a previous , short - lived relationship .
A former girlfriend , unable to cope with the demands of motherhood , had handed the boy over to foster parents .
Bewildered : Michael and Alex Shergold with his sons Peter and David last week .
' Our family seems incomplete ' , says Michael
A meeting with this new - found son was out of the question , he was told , let alone any sort of relationship .
He was also informed that the boy was to be formally adopted and that the council was ringing merely to let him know .
His shock slowly turned to anger and then determination .
Hurt to have been kept in the dark for so many years , Michael still believed he was responsible for the child - whom we shall call Andrew - and launched a legal fight to secure custody .
But there were extraordinary surprises in store for Michael and his wife , Alex .
Hampshire Social Services wanted more than just his acquiescence .
Andrew , it emerged , had been diagnosed with a severe problem in one of his organs .
For legal reasons , it is not possible to be more specific .
But the boy stands little chance of living beyond his teenage years without a transplant - from a blood relative if at all possible .
The most suitable blood relative , it was explained by social workers , was Michael himself .
Illness : Michael Shergold 's son , whose identity we have concealed
In a disturbing saga , this was perhaps the most unpleasant twist of all .
It brought him to a damning conclusion - that Hampshire Social Services had made him aware of Andrew ’s existence only to provide the child with a body part .
Michael tried to adopt his son but last year he lost the battle and was refused even occasional visiting rights , which were deemed too upsetting for the boy .
Like almost all cases that go through the family court system , the details were not made public .
Michael now has to decide whether to risk his own life with a dangerous operation for a son who , as things stand , he will never see .
‘ Words can not express the anger and bewilderment I feel , ’ says Michael .
‘ I simply cannot believe how Social Services can be so cruel .
To track me down , tell me I have a son I knew nothing about , throw my life into chaos and then tell me I will never be able to see him is nothing short of disgraceful . ’
The Mail on Sunday asked Hampshire County Council two months ago about its handling of the case .
It responded by obtaining a legal injunction to prevent us printing Michael ’s story , claiming that to do so might damage his son ’s chances of settling down .
Determined that Michael should get the chance to speak , The Mail on Sunday has pursued a lengthy legal fight to lift the injunction , and last week we succeeded .
Today , in this exclusive interview , Michael is able to talk about his ordeal for the first time .
‘ To know my son has been adopted against my consent by strangers rather than his blood family , where he would have had a loving home , has been bad enough , ’ he says .
‘ But to know that , if I do n’t donate an organ , my son might not live long enough to know me has put me in the worst situation of all .
I ’m in a dilemma about what to do .
I feel I am being asked to make a decision in a vacuum .
If I could just see my son and maintain some sort of contact , I would have absolutely no hesitation about doing it . ’
Michael , 55 , was speaking at his spacious three - bedroom house in Southampton , the city where he was born and where he has spent his whole life .
Sitting by his side is Alex .
Originally from Los Angeles , she moved to Britain in 2002 , the same year the couple married , and she became a pastor with a Pentecostal church in Portsmouth .
This is not the first time that Michael , who works as a school caretaker , has suffered domestic drama .
His 16 - year marriage ended in 1996 when he discovered that his first wife had been unfaithful .
He was given custody of the children - Peter , now 17 , David , 20 , and Susanna , 30 - and brought them up single - handedly .
As Alex serves home - made carrot cake and their cuckoo clock announces the time , the Shergolds seem every inch a loving family .
Their attitude to their predicament is one of quiet anger and grief rather than unfettered fury .
‘ We have a wonderful , close - knit family , ’ says Michael .
Peter and David , who still live at home , flit in and out as the couple talk .
Susanna lives close by .
It is a particular irony that Michael has been employed by Hampshire County Council for the past 35 years , overseeing the repairs , cleaning and maintenance of a local primary school .
As it happens , the job requires him to undergo criminal record checks every year and neither he nor Alex , who was also checked , has any convictions .
The letter that shattered Michael ’s life came in January 2007 , but the origins of the trauma lay five years earlier , when he had embarked on a difficult relationship with a much younger woman .
Despite their age difference , things went well at first after they were introduced through friends .
‘ She was the first woman I ’d dated since splitting up with my wife , ’ he recalls .
‘ At first I did n’t think of having a relationship with her because , at 29 , she was much younger than me .
But she was bubbly and got on well with the boys .
It was only after a few months that I realised she was unstable and had a drink problem .
She would swear in front of the boys and I ended the relationship . ’
He had no inkling that she might be pregnant and that , he thought , was the end of the matter .
Indeed , it was not long before he met Alex through a friendship website .
Like Michael , she has three grown - up children and , again like Michael , she had spent years bringing them up single - handedly .
She worked for US military intelligence , where she studied for degrees in psychology and theology .
Michael and Alex married a few months after meeting and settled down to a domestic routine , enjoying rounds of golf , games of bowls , trips to the cinema and regular visits to church .
That all changed with Hampshire County Council ’s bombshell .
‘ It was a terrible shock , ’ recalls Alex .
‘ Michael was told by a social worker that his child had been put into foster care . ’
At 53 , Alex thought she had said goodbye to bringing up a child , but she was as determined as her husband to welcome Andrew into the family .
‘ That was where he belonged , ’ she says .
‘ Not with strangers to whom he is not related . ’
The couple , whose children had also come round to the idea of embracing a new sibling into their lives , visited Hampshire Social Services ’ headquarters in Winchester , where they were shown Andrew ’s picture .
With hindsight , they were naively optimistic .
Immediately infatuated , they dug out Scalextric and Lego sets , embarked on plans to turn their loft into a fourth bedroom and even researched school places .
‘ He looked just like his daddy , ’ says Alex .
‘ We were determined that although he ’d had such a dreadful start in life , we ’d soon make it all up to him . ’
When , two weeks later , DNA tests confirmed that Michael was the father , the couple instructed a solicitor to stop the adoption order and begin their own custody proceedings .
‘ I thought that once Social Services saw our happy family home and how much we wanted Andrew to be a part of it , it would only be a matter of weeks before he would come to live with us , ’ says Michael .
But then came the breathtaking twist .
‘ At our second meeting with Social Services a social worker told us , “ Andrew needs an organ transplant and , as you know , an organ is best donated from a blood relative . ” ’
The couple were left in no doubt that Michael ’s co-operation was essential if his son was to stand a good chance of surviving .
His mother , they learned , had initially agreed to be the donor but changed her mind on the grounds that it would hinder her chances of having another child .
Social workers told Michael that he , and his children , were the ‘ next choice ’ .
He admits : ‘ I was taken aback but , of course , desperately worried and keen to help my son . ’
Meanwhile , two independent social workers were assigned to assess Michael and Alex as potential parents for Andrew .
It was , by all accounts , a rigorous process .
‘ I was surprised to be interrogated by a total stranger , ’ he says , ‘ but I hid nothing . ’
Yet , over a
dozen visits , the questions became increasingly invasive .
‘ The worst questions were about our sex life , ’ he says .
‘ They kept asking how “ healthy ” it was - we took it to mean how many times a week we made love - and if we indulged in ' normal ' sex . ’
Alex , who admits she did n’t take kindly to the intrusion , adds : ‘ I felt that side of our marriage was private and we did n’t see how it could be relevant .
In the end I replied , “ None of your business and I am not happy to elaborate further . ”
Perhaps it is because I ’m an American and a Christian , but I found the Social Services ’ attitude difficult to understand . ’
Meanwhile , the truth about Andrew ’s situation gradually emerged .
Finding a permanent home was not easy , however .
The boy ’s illness demanded a special diet and regular hospital visits .
After his rejection by one set of foster parents , his photograph had to be posted on an adoption website before finally , in 2006 , the couple who were eventually to adopt him came forward .
‘ I could n’t believe this could have happened to my son , ’ says Michael .
‘ I found it incredible .
‘ Social Services told me in our first phone conversation that Andrew 's mother had named me as the father .
Yet , as far as I can see , they made no effort to find me .
I have lived in the same house for 11 years .
I am on the electoral roll and in the phone book . ’
Hampshire County Council says it did its best to locate Michael .
‘ A care order would not have been made had the court not been satisfied that every effort had been made to locate Mr Shergold , ’ says council leader Ken Thornber .
‘ We have apologised to Mr Shergold for our failure to find him during care proceedings .
‘ All circumstances leading to a child coming into care involve a degree of human tragedy and require very finely balanced judgments to be made .
The needs of the child must always be the paramount concern and the judge did conclude that the local authority did its best , when it discovered the difficult situation that had arisen , to communicate with Mr Shergold and establish what contribution he could make to his son ’s life . ’
Michael believes he was eventually traced only because doctors said Andrew would need a transplant .
Indeed , he now believes that even his attempt to adopt Andrew was something of a charade .
‘ We began to feel that Social Services had let us go through the custody proceedings for nothing - that the adoption was arranged and they had no intention of placing Andrew with us , ’ he says .
The Shergolds were refused custody at Portsmouth County Court last November .
The judge admitted the background had been ‘ difficult and somewhat unsatisfactory ’ but ruled that moving Andrew in with the Shergolds would cause him unnecessary ‘ difficulty and disruption ’ .
Just two days later - suspiciously quickly in the view of the Shergolds - he had been formally adopted , leaving the Shergolds in the cold .
Even their request that Michael should be able to see him for visits was turned down on the grounds that it would be ‘ unsettling for Andrew ’ , who was ‘ bonding ’ with his new family .
Yet Andrew 's mother , who was judged unfit , is still allowed to visit Andrew twice a year .
Meanwhile , Hampshire Social Services are still pressing Michael to donate an organ .
Even if Michael decides to do so , it will make no difference .
‘ I was stunned , ’ he says .
‘ I asked them what would happen if I gave him a part of my body .
They said that even then , I would n’t be allowed contact .
Andrew would not even be told who donated the organ as this would be ' too unsettling ' . ’
The dilemma has had damaging repercussions for the Shergold family .
Michael says his children are wounded and that even his marriage has suffered .
The criticism they endured during the adoption process hardly helped .
‘ Social Services accused me of being unco-operative , ’ explains Alex .
‘ They made it plain they did n’t like me .
It seems being American was a problem and so too , I think , was the colour of my skin . ’
Alex is mixed - race .
One official report on the couple expressed concern that Andrew would be brought up in a dual - ethnicity family .
‘ They made out I was a foreigner who had no idea how to look after a child , ’ she says .
‘ I ’ve raised three children .
Despite the fact that they live in the States , we are incredibly close .
I also think of Michael ’s sons as my own .
‘ I began to think that if I was n’t around , Michael would have got custody .
One night I suggested to Michael and his sons that I leave .
Thankfully , they would n’t hear of it .
But the stress has been unbearable .
Undoubtedly , Michael and I would have split up if our relationship was n’t so strong . ’
And Michael adds : ‘ Social Services have never given me a concrete reason why my wife and I are not suitable .
That is because there is no reason . ’
The couple did not qualify for legal aid and have spent £ 4,000 on solicitors .
Now they have been told there is no further action they can take .
Overshadowing everything , however , is the decision to donate an organ .
‘ If I do n’t donate an organ , Andrew might not live long enough to meet me and the guilt would probably be too much to live with , ’ he says .
‘ If I do , it will be as if I am donating to someone who I do n’t really know exists .
‘ How can social workers sleep at night , knowing they have separated a boy from his real father , a good father who has already successfully raised three children ?
They wo n’t even pass on birthday cards .
‘ They have stormed in and left us to pick up the pieces .
I cannot believe that in this country someone can stop you seeing your own child when you have done nothing wrong .
‘ Our family seems incomplete .
If I see a boy in the street , I wonder if it ’s him .
I dream of him meeting his brothers and sister and joining us when we have big birthday celebrations .
My only hope is that he can choose to trace me when he is 18 .
‘ But what if he does n’t live that long or is told lies about me – that his father is dead or did n’t want him ?
It breaks my heart to think we may never meet . ’

I read an interesting piece by hacker - about his different attempts at hacking various closed systems .
While most people attribute hacking to computers , and I tried to make note of other things possible to hack in my article Hacking Snail Mail , I never quite thought of hacking the mind .
And for that reason I found the entire piece quite interesting - albeit it was quite short , and nowhere near the depth that I would have liked it to be .
And being that I had n't thought of the idea myself , it would be wrong of me to take credit for it - particularly because the hacker is quite a good computer hacker ... and you do n't want to piss those guys off .
So what exactly is hacking the mind ?
Probably a better word for it is manipulation .
Getting someone to do something , or think something , without them realizing that you 're the cause .
As the writer of the article wrote : " You read my words I typed here , they entered your mind in both a consciousness and unconsciousness way .
I transferred my thoughts into your thoughts ...
" And writing - if it 's any good - does exactly that .
It evokes a similar train of thought than the one the writer had at the time of writing - but it can also do much more .
For example , were I to be making an argument - I could keep the argument far more subtle , making only the points and letting you arrive to the conclusion I intended all along .
But now is n't that a scary thought .
Consider a website - one which you sign on to .
How secure are you when you use that site ?
If you provide an email with a password , you are being pretty trusting .
You trust that the password is encrypted .
You trust that your email will not be sent to spam distribution lists .
Many - a surprising many - will even use the very same password on the site that they do with their online banking accounts , their personal email accounts , their Facebook , etc .
That 's a lot of trust .
And you put yourself out there very time you log on to a website - any website .
We take it for granted , but unless you 've explicitly seen the code , you never really know what it 's doing under the hood , do you ?
But now ...
I 'm not talking about website you subscribe to .
I 'm talking about words that are written , that you subscribe to .
You may not be giving me information about yourself when you read words I have written - but you are allowing me complete access to your mind .
You have no idea what sentence is going to follow this one .
You only assume it will be one which will maintain a logical flow - but you 've completely entrusted yourself to me with something far more precious than an email password , or even a bank account password .
By reading my very words , you 've trusted your mind to me - or anyone else whose writing you read .
Or anyone else who you listen to , or watch .
It 's an altogether frightening thought .
Would you give complete anonymous access to your computer - perhaps not allowing your files to be read , but allowing anyone to place their files on your computer ?
Would you let people upload their pictures , their music , their writing , to your computer ?
Maybe that does n't sound so bad .
But what about their viruses ?
What about their worms ?
Imagine if someone did that with the mind ... The best example of a mind exploit is the suggestion of failure - one I had learned about in a Neuroscience seminar from a Psychology course I took in college .
What 's most remarkable is that even telling the subject that they will be tested against a suggestion of failure - rather than simply given the suggestion of failure , yields the same results .
In other words - my telling you about this experiment before even conducting it , does not change the results that people ultimately fail .
I think it 's in part because the subject regards this preamble as part of the suggestion that they will fail the experiment - so it does not affect the results .
Anyway : Given two patterned images in sequence - both having a unique hidden image - it is impossible to find the hidden image in one , if it is found in the other .
Here are the two images ... an explanation of why this occurs is below - do n't worry , there 's no spoilers .
While many then go on to say it has to do with the color of the two images , and the difference in pattern , the actual reason my professor gave was this :
In the initial phase , you do n't know what exactly to look for .
When you read " Find the robin " or " Find the face " you do n't know what the face or robin looks like .
Is it a cartoon ?
Is it an actual image ?
Is it only outlined by the pattern , but is n't really there ?
Is it the whole thing , or a portion of it ?
Are the colors true to life , or are they altered so that it is blended in ?
But then - and here 's where the trick is - once you find the hidden image in one , you automatically assume the hidden image in the other will be similar .
That is , if you find the hidden image in one - you assume that it will follow the same rules .
If it 's a cartoon in one , it will be a cartoon in the other .
If the pattern traces the outline of one , it will trace the outline of another .
If it has one orientation , the other will have the same orientation .
But if both images have drastically different rules - a cartoon that is outlined by the pattern , rotated so that it is upside down - and the other is an actual image that is slightly obscured , with true - to - life colors , then it becomes virtually impossible to find the other .
Unless the two images are not given in sequence , of course .
The manipulation there is a double - manipulation .
For one , you 're told that you will fail - and so the hard you try , the more frustrated you get , that it practically becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
But also , and the stronger manipulation that you are completely unaware of , is that the two hidden images are entirely different in style .
But nothing is said of this , and so you are manipulated into thinking they will be the same .
And just as all these illusions go - once you find the image , you can never not see that image .
Whether you are into writing poetry , short stories , or maybe some novels , you are most likely going to go through some of the struggles of creative writing as well .
It may be something that you enjoy doing , it can be a requirement you need to meet or it can simply be something like a hobby but the point would be that you are going to really make the most out of it as well .
Here are some things that would be nice to take note of when it comes to writing that .

If you have n’t heard of this yet , it is about time that you do : if you do n’t ready , you are most likely not going to be able to write .
It is important to read because this is where you are going to get your inspiration from as well .
You really should know that there is much more to things than what you know them up to be and if you want to be able to grow as a writer , reading is something that should be like second nature to you .
Research
Do not just read and accept facts but rather , do research so that you know that you are going to be able to just make the most out of what you have .
This ensures you that you are actually going to write something that is real and right and not just something that you have read from another person ’s story .
Just try your best and remember that if you are writing something , believability is still at the top of it too .
Find your own voice
Do not be a Shakespeare , do not try to be him but rather try to be your own self because that is the best way you are going to be able to make sure you do things right .
It is really going to be helpful if you can do your best to just make the most out of things .
Bishop Duncan and other conservative leaders in North America say they may not seek approval for their new province from the Archbishop of Canterbury , the Most Rev. Rowan Williams , or from the Anglican Consultative Council , the leadership group of bishops , clergy and laity that until now was largely responsible for blessing new jurisdictions .
Bishop Martyn Minns , a leading figure in the formation of the new province , said of the Archbishop of Canterbury : “ It ’s desirable that he get behind this .
It ’s something that would bring a little more coherence to the life of the Communion .
But if he does n’t , so be it . ”
Bishop Minns , a priest who led his large , historic church in Fairfax , Va. , out of the Episcopal Church two years ago and was subsequently ordained a bishop by the Anglican Archbishop of Nigeria , said in an interview : “ One of the questions a number of the primates are asking is why do we still need to be operating under the rules of an English charity , which is what the Anglican Consultative Council does .
Why is England still considered the center of the universe ? ”
Jim Naughton , canon for communications and advancement in the Episcopal Diocese of Washington , and a liberal who frequently blogs on Anglican affairs , said he doubted that a rival Anglican province could grow much larger .
“ I think this organization does not have much of a future because there are already a lot of churches in the United States for people who do n’t want to worship with gays and lesbians , ” he said .
“ That ’s not a market niche that is underserved . ”
Since the Episcopal Church ordained Bishop Gene Robinson , an openly gay man who lives with his partner , in the Diocese of New Hampshire in 2003 , the parallel rifts in the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion have widened .
In the first years after Bishop Robinson was ordained , bishops representing about 14 dioceses in the Episcopal Church joined meetings to explore the formation of a new Anglican entity in North America .
It has become really easy to find out , if you are pregnant or not – and you do n’t even need to visit a doctor .
Regular pregnancy tests you could earlier find in drugstores are no more actual , as there ’s something much more interesting , something hi-tech – USB pregnancy test kit .
Just do the same procedures as you do with the regular pregnancy test , but with an exception : the stick goes into a USB port .
Sounds like somebody ’s fantasy ?
No , it ’s reality !
As already said , you should start as you do with most pregnancy tests .
Pee on an absorbent test stick at one end .
Then remove the cap from the other stick end , where you ’ll find the USB connector , and pop it in your computer .
The power from the USB port starts the electrospray ionization process on the device and creates a spectrograph of you urine .
It analyzes your hormone levels inside the device : hCG ( human Chorionic Gonadotropin ) , hCG - H ( hyperglycosylated hCG , which is needed for detection before your first missed period ) , and LH ( luteinizing hormone , which is necessary to detect your most fertile days ) .
So , if you ’re not pregnant , you can find out the best days for the conception .
And if you ’re afraid you can be pregnant , the device should tell you , if you are , with 99 % accuracy .
The USB pregnancy test kit comes with 20 test strips .
It costs about $ 18 and is already available .
When you ’re done with the test results , pop the test out of the computer and change the strip .
You will be able to review the results for more 5 minutes .
Please , note , that this gadget does n’t necessarily detect pregnancy or ovulation , as your hormone levels can be influenced by other factors .
Anyway , the idea is great !
I also want to tell you I need to say sorry for being so late with this information , as the gadget already existed about half a year ago .
I found it only recently and thought , you would be interested , too .
Finally , I ca n’t be the only one , who did n’t know about it !
Back in the 90's application developers often exposed their API through COM Automation .
This allowed third - party developers to attach to and manipulate running applications through a rich set of extension points .
Unfortunately , that spirit of interoperability has largely fallen by the wayside in the .NET era .
Crack .NET tries to bring back some of that power by opening up WinForm and WPF - based .NET applications .
With a rich GUI that puts Visual Studio 's property inspector to shame , users can attach to most .NET applications .
This relies entirely on the .NET infrastructure , the original application developer does n't need to provide any explicit hooks .
Once attached , users are free to explore and manipulate the running application .
However , the real fun comes in when you start scripting .
With IronPython scripts , developers can inject code into running applications to add whatever features they see as missing .
As .NET and the DLR become more popular , we could see a whole new cottage industry for add - ons to applications that were not meant to be extendible .

Obama raises $ 66 million in August
Sen . Barack Obama raised $ 66 million in the month of August , making it his best month ever and the best in American political history , an aide said Sunday morning .
Obama is releasing that number after suggestions that his fundraising was failing to meet expectations .
It puts him on pace to substantially outspend John McCain in the last two months of the race , in which McCain will be limited to spending the $ 84 million supplied by the Treasury under public financing rules .
Obama 's large take , and the expectation that he 'll raise even more in the race 's final two months , may put to rest some Democrats ' worries that he'd made a mistake by opting out of public financing .
It does n't mean the Democrats will outspend the Republicans this year , though .
The Republican National Committee 's cash advantage over the Democratic National Committee , in combination with swelling outside spending , will likely allow McCain to level the playing field , though the fact that Obama has raised the money himself , in small chunks , gives him direct control over how it 's spent , and fewer concerns about technical limits on spending .
An Obama aide said the campaign added 500,000 new donors to its rolls in August .
The new figure — which shatters his previous one - month record of $ 55 million — also demonstrates how the increasingly heated , nasty race has energized Obama 's fundraising and raises expectations that he will raise that much or more in each of the next two months .
Obama 's tally suggests that McCain 's late - August choice of Sarah Palin , which has energized conservatives — though largely too late for them to contribute directly to McCain 's campaign — may also wind up deepening Obama 's reserves when its full effect is felt in his September report .
The McCain campaign raised $ 47 million in August .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said that the Obama campaign had $ 77 million on hand ; it had just under $ 66 million on hand at the end of July , meaning that it spent roughly $ 55 million last month .

John Cook , wrote a lovely post , Peter Drucker and abandoning projects , explaining how Drucker talks about abandoning projects .
( John , thanks , I will definitely be referencing Drucker in the PPM book . )
I have n't been using the word “ abandon ” when I describe stopping projects .
I 've been using the word “ Kill ” and the concepts of permanently stopping projects ( killing them ) and putting projects on the parking lot ( stopping them for now ) .
John actually says the words from a developer 's perspective :
It can be a tremendous relief to abandon a project .
He 's right .
It is a huge relief to stop working on a project .
Here 's why I 've been using the word “ kill ” instead of abandon .
I want people to make a conscious decision that this project is not worth continuing at all .
( The three possible decisions are commit to ; kill ; or transform a project . )
Abandoning feels more like we can just stop the project in whatever state it 's in and walk away from it .
But I do n't know people who can do that .
Every time I 've seen managers attempt to abandon projects , the technical staff want to wrap things up , or get them to a state where the project can be shelved and restarted again later .
That 's why I separate the ideas of stopping a project for now ( and putting the project on the parking lot ) and killing the project .
Here 's an example of why I feel so strongly about this .
I was working for a small company as a developer many years ago .
We were not making enough money .
Management stopped a project “ for a while ” where the duration was indeterminate .
Over lunch , I asked my boss when we would start it back up again .
He said , “ Never , with any luck . ”
But that 's not what was communicated to the technical staff .
One developer said , “ Well , management has abandoned this project .
But I 'm not .
I 'm going to save this project . ”
Ouch , not what management wanted and not what the company needed .
The company needed us all on a project that could actually make money , not the money pit .
But the other fellow thought that management had abandoned the project , not made a decision to stop it .
If our management had considered the killing or parking of projects , maybe my colleague would not have continued working on a project that had no future and was diminishing the ability of the company to make money .
We would have been in better shape if we had killed that project .
Maybe kill is too strong a word .
But if we want to stop a project permanently , I do want to kill it .
I do n't want people doing skunk work on it .
I do n't want more investigation .
I do want it killed .
For me , abandon is n't a strong - enough word .
And , if we can't sufficiently fund this project now , I want to put the project on the parking lot , or somewhere in the unstaffed work list .
I hope you chime in with your reaction about abandon vs. kill .

Authorities warn that the human threat from bird flu has not gone away More than 370,000 chickens have been culled in China 's eastern province of Jiangsu after an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu , say officials .
The outbreak is thought to be the first in mainland China since June .
Meanwhile , a man has reportedly contracted the virus in Cambodia , while Taiwan is investigating suspected infection among birds .
The death of a teenage girl from H5N1 was announced in Egypt on Tuesday , and a bird cull is also under way in India .
More than 200 people in a dozen countries have died of the virus since it resurfaced in Asia in 2003 , say global health authorities .
Experts fear that the virus could mutate into one that is easily transmissible from human to human .
Migrating birds blamed China 's Ministry of Agriculture said it received notification that the H5N1 virus had been found in two areas of Jiangsu on Monday .
The usual precautions have been imposed : birds have been slaughtered in the surrounding area , farms quarantined and disinfected , and the transport of fowl banned .
But no information has been released about the scale of the outbreak - how many birds were found to be carrying the H5N1 strain of the virus and how many of them died .
Officials say they think migrating birds might have been the source of the disease .
They are currently testing samples of the virus to check it has not mutated into a form that would pose a risk to human health , reports the BBC's Chris Hogg in Shanghai .
Virus returns China is among a number of countries experiencing a return of the virus this season : • Authorities in the Indian state of West Bengal are implementing a cull after tests on poultry from two villages yielded positive results •
In Cambodia , another cull is under way after the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) and government confirmed a young man had the virus , according to Reuters news agency • Authorities in Taiwan say they are investigating the cause of the sudden death of poulty in Luzhu , Kaohsiung county , Reuters says • Earlier in the week , Egyptian authorities announced the death of a 16 - year - old girl from the virus •
The discovery of infected birds in Hong Kong last week sparked a cull of more than 80,000 birds
WHO warning
The WHO recently warned governments in Asia not to let down their guard against bird flu .
Some experts fear that because the virus has not yet mutated into a form that could spread easily among humans , the fight against bird flu is seen as less of a priority than before .
Countries like China - with huge densely populated cities and in many places only basic healthcare and veterinary services - are thought to be particularly vulnerable should the virus become more deadly , says our correspondent Chris Hogg .

Mail to a friend Print this article Introduction Bézier curves are ubiquitous in computer graphics .
They were introduced implicitly into theoretical mathematics long before computers , primarily by the French mathematician Charles Hermite and the Russian mathematician Sergei Bernstein .
But it was only the work of Pierre Bézier , an employee of the automobile maker Renault , and of Paul de Casteljau , of Citroen , that made these curves familiar to graphics specialists .
Recently , the polynomials defined by Bernstein have become again of interest to mathematicians .
Bézier curves
The simplest Bézier curve is the straight line from one point P 0 to another P 1 , with the parametric equation B ( t ) = P 0 + t( P 1 - P 0 ) = ( 1 -t ) P 0 + t P 1 from which it follows immediately that B ( 0 ) = P 0
B ( 1 ) = P 1 .
For t in between 0 and 1 the point B ( t ) is t of the way from one to the other .
This is the same as the weighted average of the two points , with P 0 given weight 1-t and P 1 given weight t.
When t=1/2 , for example , B ( t ) is the point ( 1/2 ) ( P 0 + P 1 ) halfway between P 0 and P 1 .
A quadratic Bézier curve is determined by three control points P 0 , P 1 , and P 2 .
It has the parametric form B ( t ) = ( 1 - t ) 2 P 0 + 2t ( 1-t ) P 1 + t2 P 2
When t=0 all but terms but the first vanish , and when t=1 all but the last vanish .
Therefore B ( 0 ) = P 0
B ( 1 ) = P 2 .
The velocity vector at t is B '( t ) = - 2(1-t ) P 0 + 2 ( 1-t ) P 1 - 2 t P 1 + 2t P 2 = 2 [ ( 1 -t ) ( P 1 - P 0 ) + t ( P 2 - P 1 ) ] .
When t=0 the velocity vector is 2 ( P 1 - P 0 ) and when t=1 it is 2 ( P 2 - P 1 ) .
Thus , the path starts at P 0 , ends at P 2 , and its tangents at P 0 and P 2 intersect at P 1 .
A cubic Bézier curve is determined by four control points P 0 , P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 .
It has the parametric form B ( t ) = ( 1 - t ) 3P 0 + 3 t( 1-t ) 2P 1 + 3t2(1-t ) P 2 + t3P 3 Again , B ( 0 ) = P 0 and B ( 1 ) = P 3 .
The velocity vector at t is B '( t ) = 3 [ ( 1 - t ) 2 ( P 1 -P 0 ) + 2t ( 1-t ) ( P 2 _P 1 ) + t2 ( P 3 -P 2 ) ] .
When t=0 the velocity vector is 3 ( P 1 - P 0 ) and when t=1 it is 3 ( P 3 - P 2 ) .
Thus , the path starts at P 0 , ends at P 3 ; when it leaves P 0 it is heading towards P 1 , and when it arrives at P 3 it is coming from the direction of P 2 .
Otherwise , the relationship between the path and the control points is intuitively weak .
In all these cases , the coefficients of the points P i in the parametric equation are terms which appear in the binomial expansion , respectively ( 1 - t ) , t
( 1 - t ) 2 , 2t ( 1 -t ) , t2
( 1 - t ) 3 , 3t ( 1 - t ) 2 , 3t2 ( 1 - t ) , t3 .
For t between 0 and 1 these are non-negative , and by the binomial theorem the sum is [ t + ( 1 - t ) ]n = 1n = 1 for n=1 , 2 , 3 .
What this means is that each point B ( t ) is a weighted average of the control points , hence lies inside the convex hull of those points .
A Bézier curve of one degree can be reproduced by one of higher degree .
For example , the quadratic Bézier curve with control points P 0 , P 1 , P 2 is the same as the cubic Bézier curve with control points Q 0 = P 0
Q 1 = ( 1/3 ) P 0 + ( 2/3 ) P 1
Q 2 = ( 2/3 ) P 1 + ( 1/3 ) P 2
Q 3 = P 2
This can be checked by a simple algebraic calculation .
Calculus and Bézier curves Suppose B ( t ) to be a cubic Bézier curve .
We know that its coordinates are functions of t , and that position and velocity at endpoints are determined by the equations : B (0 ) = P 0
B '( 0 ) = 3 ( P 1 -P 0 )
B '( 1 ) = 3 ( P 3 -P 2 )
B ( 1 ) = P 3 .
These conditions determine B ( t ) uniquely , because of a simple result first observed by the French mathematician Charles Hermite .
The conditions above are really conditions on the coordinates of B ( t ) , so the claim follows from this : THEOREM .
Given numbers y 0 , v 0 , y 1 , v 1 , there exists a unique polynomial P( x ) of degree 3 such that P( 0 ) = y 0
P'( 0 ) = v 0
P(1 ) = y 1
P'( 1 ) = v 1 .
We can guess a formula for P ( t ) , from that of Bézier cubic curves : P( t ) = ( 1 - t ) 3y 0 + 3 ( 1 - t ) 2t [y 0 + ( 1/3 ) v 0 ] + 3 ( 1-t ) t2 [ y 1 - ( 1/3 ) v 1 ] + t3 y 1 .
As for uniqueness , if we have two such polynomials , let D( x ) = a + bx + cx2 + dx3 be their difference .
Then P(0 ) = a = 0
P'( 0 ) = b = 0
P'( 1 ) = b + 2 c + 3d = 0
P( 1 ) = a + b + c + d = 0 .
These tell us immediately that a=b=0 , and these four equations immediately reduce to two : 2 c + 3d = 0
c + d = 0 , which have only the solutions c=d=0 .
Q.E.D.
This is a special case of the main result of Hermite , according to which we may find a unique polynomial of degree n- 1 satisfying a total of n conditions on values of the low order derivatives at possibly different points .
This is called Hermite interpolation .
This Theorem suggests a converse process .
Suppose we are given a formula for a function f( x ) , as well as a formula for its derivative f'(x ) , and suppose we want to graph the function in a range a ≤ x ≤ b .
We could just draw a bunch of very small line segments , but we can get a smoother curve by using Bézier cubic curves .
Because if we are given a mediumly small range [ c , d ] it seems like a reasonable idea to approximate the function over that range by a cubic polynomial P( x ) that satisfies these conditions : P( c ) = f(c )
P'( c ) = f '(c )
P'( d ) = f'(d )
P(d ) = f( d ) .
To see how Hermite 's result applies , replace P varying over the range [ c , d ] by Q(t ) where t varies over [ 0,1 ] , and with Q( t ) = P ( ( 1 - t ) c + td ) , P( x ) = Q ( (x - c ) / ( d- c ) ) .
To this Q we can apply Hermite 's formula .
A little algebra will then show that the graph between c and d will be approximated by the Bézier cubic with control points ( c , f ( c ) )
(c + h/3 , f( c ) + ( h / 3 ) f ' ( c ) )
(d - h/3 , f ( d ) - ( h / 3 ) f ' ( d ) )
( d , f ( d ) ) where h=d -c .
There is one situation where this technique is definitely a good idea .
Suppose that where we do not have a formula for the indefinite integral of g(x ) .
For example , we might have
Then we must approximate the integral numerically , say by Simpson 's rule , so we have a recursive estimate f( x+h ) = f( x ) + ( h / 6 ) ( g( x ) + 4 g( x + h / 2 ) + g( x+h ) ) and , by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus , the graph between x and x+h for small h is approximated by the Bézier curve with control points ( x , f ( x ) )
( x + h/3 , f ( x ) + ( h / 3 ) g ( x ) )
( x + 2h/3 , f( x+h ) - ( h / 3 ) g( x+h ) )
( x + h , f( x+h ) ) where the last is computed according to Simpson 's rule .
The same idea can be nicely used to plot the trajectories of systems of differential equations in the plane , using a numerical approximation to go from f( x ) to f( x+h ) , such as one of the Runge - Kutta formulas .
Why Bézier curves ?
There is something at first a bit odd about cubic Bézier curves , the fact that the curves do n't actually go through the control points .
So let 's imagine an alternate way to draw curves that go nicely from one point P 0 to another point P 3 , with a cubic parametrization P( t ) .
The only technique that suggests itself naturally is choosing two points P 1 and P 2 , and having the curve pass through them , not just near them as Bézier curves do .
This means also choosing parameter values t 1 and t 2 with P(t 1 ) = P 1 and P(t 2 ) = P 2 .
The first choice that comes to mind is t 1 = 1/3 , t 2 =2/3 .
But it is well known ( and explained clearly in the book by Henrici referred to later ) that the curves chosen in this way look very odd .
What turns out to be more reasonable is to choose t 1 closer to 0 , t 2 closer to 1 .
But this means that we are very close to fixing values of the velocity at 0 and 1 , which is essentially what Bézier curves do .
The deciding factor in choosing Bézier curves is a recursive property that makes them extremely efficient to compute .
There is an algorithm attributed to de Casteljau that draws them very quickly .
This depends on a certain recursive property .
Suppose we are given a quadratic Bézier curve with control points P i .
Let 's now divide it up into two halves , with P 012 = B ( 1/2 ) .
Let P 01 be the point midway between P 0 and P 1 , P 12 be that midway between P 1 and P 2 .
In these circumstances : ( 1 ) the point P 012 is the point midway between P 01 and P 12 ; ( 2 ) the half curve between P 0 and the midpoint P 012 is again a quadratic Bézier curve with control points P 0 , P 01 , and P 012 .
Similarly for the second half .
Therefore , in order to draw the curve the computer can keep calculating midpoints - very easy to do on modern binary machines since it involves division by 2 - until it has broken the curve into a number of small segments that are essentially straight , and then it can draw all those as straight line segments .
Something very similar happens for cubic Bézier curves , too - each half of a cubic Bézier curve is a Bézier curve with easily calculated control points , as the neighboring figure illustrates .
Bézier curves and fonts
One of the most common uses of Bézier curves is in the design of fonts .
Cubic Bézier curves are used in Type 1 fonts , and quadratic Bézier curves are used in True Type fonts .
Cubic Bézier curves are also used in the TEX fonts designed by Donald Knuth , and one of the clearest explanations is in his book MetaFont : the Program .
Bernstein polynomials
The formulas for the coordinates of Bézier curves B 1 ( t ) = ( 1 - t ) x 0 + t x 1
B 2 ( t ) = ( 1 - t ) 2 x 0 + 2 ( 1 - t ) t x 1 + t2 x 2
B 3 ( t ) = ( 1 - t ) 3 x 0 + 3 ( 1 - t ) 2t x 1 + 3 ( 1 - t ) t2 x 2 + t3 x 3 are special cases of a more general formula for polynomials of all degrees B n , x ( t ) = ( 1 - t ) n x 0 + n ( 1 - t ) n - 1t x 1 + n( n - 1)/2 ( 1-t ) n- 2t2 x 2 + ... + C n , k ( 1 - t ) n- ktk x k + ... + tn x n where C n , k is the binomial coefficient n!/k!(n-k ) !
Thus B n , x ( 0 ) = x 0 , B n , x ( 1 ) = x n .
Here x is the array ( x i ) .
These polynomials were first defined by the Russian mathematician Sergei Bernstein around 1910 .
The coefficients of a Bernstein polynomial of degree n are the coefficients in the binomial expansion of [ ( 1 - t ) + t]n .
They are all non-negative , and their sum is 1 .
The value of B n ( t ) is therefore a weighted average of the numbers x i in the array x .
The term C n , k ( 1 - t ) n - ktk is also the probability of k successes in n trials in which the probability of a success is t .
This is not an unimportant fact , as we shall see .
They have a number of fundamental properties that we have seen already for Bézier curves :
The derivative of B n , x ( t ) is B ' n , x ( t ) = nB n - 1, dx ( t ) where dx is the array of differences ( x i+1 -x i ) .
Thus both B' n , x ( 0 ) and B ' n , x ( 1 ) have simple expressions .
Otherwise , the exact relationship between the polynomial and its control values is rather obscure .
One other useful feature is that The graph of y = B n , x ( t ) for t between 0 and 1 lies inside the convex hull of the points ( k/n , x k ) .
A related fact , which is crucial in the application of Bernstein polynomials to optimization problems :
The maximum and minimum values of B n , x ( t ) in [ 0,1 ] are bounded by the maximum and minimum values of its coefficients .
And here is the proper generalization of de Casteljau 's algorithm :
The restrictions of B n , x ( t ) to each half - range [ 0,1/2 ] and [ 1/2,1 ] are also Bernstein polynomials , in the sense that each of B n , x ( 2t ) and B n , x ( 1 - 2t ) can be expressed as B n , y ( t ) for some array y that is simple to calculate .
These polynomials were invented by Sergei Bernstein in order to prove a fundamental result in approximation theory , as we shall see in the next section .
They are impractical in this role , but in recent years they have proven important in optimization theory .
See , for example , the thesis of Roland Zumkeller ( linked to in the References ) .
This is gratifying - almost anyone who has seen Bernstein 's proof of Weierstrass ' theorem must have felt that these polynomials were destined to play other roles , as well .
Bernstein's proof of Weierstrass ' approximation theorem
In about 1885 Karl Weierstrass , at the age of 70 , published a proof of one of the theorems for which he is most famous :
Any continuous function on the interval [ 0,1 ] may be uniformly approximated , arbitrarily closely , by polynomials .
The definition of continuous functions is relatively simple , and this definition is in close accord with intuition , so it was apparently surprising to learn , as mathematicians of the nineteenth century acquired more and more knowledge about them , that continuous functions could exhibit rather strange behavior .
Weierstrass ' theorem was perhaps considered refreshing evidence that they were not so wildly behaved after all .
Many outstanding mathematicians soon came up with proofs rather different from Weierstrass ' original one .
One of the most satisfying was that found by Sergei Bernstein , and it was apparently for this purpose that he came up with the polynomials now named after him .
Unlike other versions , his provides a very explicit converging sequence of polynomials .
Suppose f is a continuous function on [ 0,1 ] .
For each n let f n be the array of n+1 values f( k /n ) for k = 0 , ... , n .
Explicitly , we have B n , f ( t ) = B n , f n ( t ) = f ( 0 ) ( 1 - t ) n + f ( 1/n ) n ( 1 - t ) n - 1 t + ... + f( k/n ) C n , k ( 1 - x ) n- ktk + ... + f( 1 ) tn THEOREM .
Suppose f( x ) to be a continuous function on [ 0,1 ] .
The polynomials B n , f ( x ) converge uniformly on [ 0,1 ] to f(x ) as n goes to infinity .
Here for example , is Bernstein 's approximation to f( x ) = |x - 1/2 | for n=32 : and here is a table of the Bernstein approximations of |t - 1/2 | at t=1 / 2 for various values of n : n B n , f ( 1/2 ) 4 0.1367 8 0.0982 16 0.0700 32 0.0497 64 0.0352 128 0.0249
As you can guess , the convergence here is of order about 1/n1 / 2 around t=1/2 , and better at other points .
We can see that although one virtue of Bernstein polynomials is that they can approximate arbitrary continuous functions , on functions that one sees in practice they converge at an impractically slow rate .
Bernstein 's proof of convergence is very elegant .
It is a variation on a simple argument used in a slightly different context , that of local averaging .
Suppose f to be a continuous function on [ 0,1 ] .
Define for each n a function f n ( x ) = ( 1/2 ) ( f(x - 1/2n ) + f(x + 1/2n ) ) .
In other words , the value of f n at x is the average of its values at x -1/2n and x+1/2n , an interval of width 1/n .
Or , to give slightly more complicated examples : f n ( x ) = ( 1/4 ) ( f(x - 1/n ) + 2 f( x ) + f(x + 1/n ) ) or f n ( x ) = ( 1/8 ) ( f(x - 3/2n ) + 3 f(x - 1/2n ) + 3 f( x + 1/2n ) + f(x + 3/2n ) ) .
These are now different weighted averages of f near x .
Bernstein 's definition of f n ( x ) is also a weighted average of values of f around x , but the weighting depends on x .
The value of the polynomial B n , f at x is also a weighted average of f around x , although that is not at all apparent at first sight .
It is a sum of values of f at certain point k/n , and what happens is that only the terms for k/n near x make a sizable contribution .
Here are some graphs of the weighting for various values of x , with n=100 : Why is this ?
The weighting function is the distribution of k successes in n trials with a probability of success equal to x .
The average number of successes - the mean value of this probability distribution - is x , and the real basis of Bernstein 's reasoning is that the standard deviation of this distribution - the quantitative measure of its spread - is σ = √ x ( 1 - x ) / n
As n grows , this shrinks .
What this means is that the probability distribution clusters more narrowly around the mean value x , and more or less uniformly for all x .
The proof uses this observation .
Since the sum of the binomial coefficients is 1 , we have | f( x ) - B n , f n ( x ) | ≤ Σ k | f( x ) - f( k/n ) | C n , k ( 1 - x ) n-k xk
We can divide the sum over the point k/n into those which are near x and those far away , since we expect the sum over the near ones will be the major contribution .
Say we choose some small number δ and sum over k/n with |x - k/n| ≤ δ and those with |x - k/n| > δ.
The first is Σ |x - k/n| ≤ δ | f( x ) - f( k/n ) | C n , k ( 1 - x ) n-k xk .
If we choose δ small enough so | f( x ) - f( k/n ) | < ε/2 whenever |x - k/n| ≤ δ , this will be less than ε /2 .
Now let let M be the maximum spread of f on [ 0,1 ] .
The second sum is Σ |x - k/n| ≤ δ | f( x ) - f( k/n ) | C n , k ( 1 - x ) n-k xk which is at most M times the sum Σ |x - k/n| > δ C n , k ( 1 - x ) n-k xk .
We must now choose n so that this sum is at most ε / 2M .
Being able to do so is plausible , since as n increases the range over which C n , k ( 1 - x ) n-k xk is sizable becomes narrower .
There are many ways to make this idea rigorous - the simplest is to use Chebyshev 's inequality .
This says that if p i is a discrete probability distribution with mean m and standard deviation σ then the probability of |t - m| ≥ s σ is at most 1 /s2 .
This is a very elementary fact , and we 'll come back to justify it in a moment .
Given it , we see that if n > 2M x ( 1 - x ) / ε δ 2 then the sum above is less than ε / 2 . Proof of Chebyshev 's inequality .
Since |t - m| / sσ > 1 if and only if |t - m|2/s2 σ 2 > 1 , the sum is that of all p i over all t i with |t i - m |2/s2 σ 2 ≥ 1 .
But this is at most the sum of |t i - m|2/s2σ2 over the same region , which is in turn is at most the sum over all i of the same terms , which is ( by definition of standard deviation ) Σ i p i ( |t i - m |2/s2 σ 2 ) = ( 1/s2 σ 2 ) Σ i p i |x i - m |2 = 1/s2 References

Ron Paul Will Now Take Your Questions
Congressman Ron Paul of Texas ran for president in the Republican primaries this year , raising more than $ 34 million and receiving more than 1.3 million votes .
That obviously was n’t enough to get anywhere near the general election , but Paul became a rogue hero of many in his party ( and beyond ) , even mounting his own counter - convention in Minneapolis while the Republican National Convention was happening across the river in St. Paul .
He has now launched a Campaign for Liberty , which is casting an eye toward the 2010 mid-term elections in the hopes of promoting “ sound money , limited government , and a respect for the inherent rights of every individual . ”
We thought that Paul might be an interesting person to hear from in the immediate aftermath of this most interesting election season , and he has agreed to field your questions .
So please fire away , and we ’ll post his answers in a few days .
Addendum : Paul answers your questions here and here .
Songbird 1.0 Flies : Flock of New Features on the Horizon
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 03 , 2008
Last month , I took a brief tour of the pre-release Songbird music player .
Songbird is a cross- platform media player based on Mozilla code .
This week , the Songbird project released the finalized 1.0 version of the player .
The pre-release versions of Songbird featured iPod support , Last .fm scrobbling , SHOUTcast radio , plugin extensions , and a localized concert discovery service .
The 1.0 release adds one more feature to its default list -- MashTape -- and turns an ambitious eye toward the future .
For those that have previously installed Songbird , clicking the Help > Check for Updates option will upgrade Songbird to the latest version .
This update was straightforward on my Ubuntu Intrepid machine , though Songbird did n't automatically restart when asked .
I manually restarted the player , it detected and updated my added extensions , and suggested I install the default features ( a few of which I had disabled previously ) .
I was n't expecting much from the MashTape feature .
Other players integrate similar features , and none really feel as though they 're worth the screen real estate or potential drag on application performance ( however negligible ) .
I 've got to admit , now , MashTape is sort of neat , and because Songbird 's configuration is click and drag , it 's easy to make disappear ( or bring back ) when desired .
It displays the usual artist biography / discography information .
Artist news is hit or miss -- Tenacious D's news seemed to come from HypeMachine , Tool 's news came , apparently , from a Google News keyword search ( unless the band 's moved on to tracking family health statistics online , this method leaves a lot to be desired ) .
The photos and video searches fell victim to the same keyword issues , but it was less jarring ( and in the aforementioned Tool example , photos and videos returned more relevant content ) .
Songbird is working on improving metadata management , supporting more devices ( iPhones , the iPod Touch , and Zunes are as yet unsupported ) , and adding album art fetching .
The developers hope to add CD ripping , video , and the ability to automatically import files from " watched " folders to Songbird soon .
There are a few strong selling points for Songbird over other players .
It is cross-platform , giving it a " consistent " feel for those who frequently use different operating systems .
It works predictably , not just as a music player , but as an application based on Mozilla code .
Installing add - ons and updating is n't much different here than in other Mozilla based projects .
Then , of course , there is the open aspect .
Even if you have no need or desire to alter any of the scripts that affect Songbird 's function , the open nature of the project makes creating -- and sharing -- extensions and themes easier .
New gun for seniors could be subsidized by Medicare John Byrne
Published : Monday December 8 , 2008
Print This Email
This A New Jersey company says they have gotten federal approval to market a gun to the elderly and hopes to have it subsized by Medicare .
Constitution Arms says its Palm Pistol will aid seniors with arthritis who would otherwise have trouble pulling the trigger .
The device allows individuals to shoot by squeezing with their thumb .
The company 's president Matthew Carmel says its " something that they need to assist them in daily living , " and has applied to have the gun approved as a Class 1 medical device , the same designation given by Medicare to walkers and wheelchairs .
Palm Pistol retails for $ 460 .
" The justification for this would be no more or less for a ( walking aid ) or wheelchair , or any number of things that are medical devices , " Carmel told New Scientist Friday .
On the description , it describes the weapon as " ideal for seniors , disabled or others who may have limited strength or manual dexterity .
" Using the thumb instead of the index finger for firing , it significantly reduces muzzle drift , " it says , " one of the principal causes of inaccurate targeting .
Point and shoot could n't be easier . "
Carmel told a medical technology blog that they 'd applied for FDA approval as a " Daily Activity Assist Device . "
The FDA said it had not yet approved the gun .
" At this time , there have been no formal designations of the Palm Pistol by the FDA as a medical device , " a spokeswoman said .
When people ask Jim and Louise Gunderson if they have kids , they reply , " No , we have robots . "
But right now , Louise feels like any other harried mother carrying a kilo of toys and bottles and diapers wherever she goes .
Today is the first big day out for her little one , and she 's brought along everything Basil the robot may need .
That includes a laptop in case they have to mess with his code , an impressively large wrench and a couple of screwdrivers if they have to tinker with his hardware , an extension cord for when he gets hungry , and super glue — lots and lots of super glue .
The adhesive 's already proven vital : A little while ago , one of Basil 's wheels fell off and they had to glue the sucker back on .
" I sympathize with people with kids , " says Louise .
" We 're going to have to make custom carriers for all this gear . "
They can't bother with that now , though .
They 're in the back meeting room of the Wynkoop Brewing Company downtown , and in just over an hour they 'll be surrounded by the legion of science and technology buffs that get together here ten times a year for Cafe Scientifique , a wildly popular beer - and curiosity - fueled colloquium on far - ranging science topics .
The Gundersons will have the spotlight , detailing their work at Gamma Two Inc. , the tiny Denver - based robotics research and design company they started in 2003 .
They 're looking spiffy for the occasion , their long hair —
Jim's is orange , and Louise 's is brown with a streak of gray — tidily done up in ponytails .
But they both know the real star today is Basil , their latest creation , here to strut his stuff .
In truth , Basil ( his name rhymes with " dazzle " ) is n't all that exciting to look at .
Standing just about waist - high , he resembles a shiny upside - down salt shaker on wheels .
He has no arms , no legs — not even eyes , unless you count the twelve sonar banks flickering up and down his aluminum chest that capture a rough outline of his surroundings .
But looks can be deceiving .
Under the hood , Basil is hot stuff — maybe even revolutionary .
The Gundersons claim to have possibly solved one of the most challenging problems in robotics , and just a few weeks ago , they published an entire book , Robots , Reasoning and Reification , about it .
Most autonomous robots today may be good at a specific , pre-programmed trick or two , like acting like a cute dog or walking up the stairs , but they can't do anything else .
The Gundersons promise that they can fix that , that their robot will be able to accept new commands , reason out ways to complete them , and then go out and do them .
Want the robot to dust the bookshelves ?
No problem .
Want it to set the table ?
Easy .
Want Basil to fetch a beer ?
Well , that 's exactly what the Gundersons hope he 'll do today .
The plan is this :
The Gundersons will ask Basil to go to the bar , request a couple of stouts from the bartender , and then , once they 're placed on the titanium tray perched on his head , bring them back to his creators .
They have n't told him how to do this — there 's no set script in his processors that tells him to roll a certain distance southwest , speak a certain command , then come back .
He 'll have to figure it all out on his own , using a basic knowledge of bars and beers and so on , reasoning skills and an ability to understand certain parts of the world .
When his sonars capture the image of a person , for example , he knows it 's a person , not just a nameless object to be avoided .
And he knows that , in this case , that person wants a beer .
" This is the first time Basil 's been out with his brains intact , " Louise notes , adding that they 've never had him complete complicated tasks in public before .
When they brought him out for their recent wedding anniversary party , for example , they turned off his higher - level brain and had him dance around by dumbly bouncing from one lady to the next — the way most guys function on the dance floor .
Today 's demo is far more challenging .
It will be one frothy beer for Basil , one giant champagne - worthy accomplishment for robotkind .
That is , if all goes as planned — which , right now , it is n't .
When the Gundersons power Basil up to check his hardware , his sonars unexpectedly go out .
They fix that , but then the robot starts spinning in circles .
That bug gets taken care of with some help from the Friends of Basil , a few of the Gundersons ' acquaintances who volunteer to help out on the robot — the closest thing that Gamma Two has to other employees .
But then a bigger problem arises :
When asked to go to the bar and introduce himself to the bartender , Basil speeds off in the opposite direction , charging toward a couple of early birds sitting in the front row .
" Now I 'm officially nervous , " says Louise .
" We have plenty of time — it 's not like people are walking in , " Jim replies sarcastically , gesturing to the crowds already filing in .
Jim and Louise have both been in the robotics industry long enough to know a cardinal rule :
Live robot demos do n't go as planned .
They 've had a computer - controlled vacuum cleaner kamikaze itself into the nearest wall .
They 've showcased a robotic walking frame , a device designed to help the elderly get around , that steadfastly refused to avoid obstacles in its path .
So who knows — maybe Basil will get stage fright .
With just minutes left before go - time , the couple realizes what 's wrong .
Jim had accidentally switched two coordinates when he loaded up Basil 's concept of the Wynkoop , making the robot mistake left for right .
Jim plugs the laptop into Basil 's computers and hurriedly resets the code .
It looks like everything 's all right — until a member of the Friends of Basil realizes something else : " Basil 's not 21 .
Will they serve him ? "
They 'll just have to find out .
Whenever Basil 's turned on , it takes him a while to come to his senses , as if he 's recovering from a long night at the bar .
" Did you turn me off again ? " he mumbles to no one in particular in a flat , digitized voice that resembles Stephen Hawking 's .
No need for an answer ; he knows he 's been out cold and has already begun his wake - up routine .
First he tests his hardware — the equivalent of us wiggling our toes .
His main brain , a low - end desktop computer perched on a platform beneath his serving tray , sends test signals throughout his body , through the low - level computer chips one platform down that comprise his brain stem and spinal cord to the motors that power his wheels and the twelve sonars that blink like Christmas lights across his chest .
He also checks the voltage on his twelve - volt battery , to make sure he 's not hungry .
If everything looks good , he announces triumphantly , " I have a body . "
It 's about a month before the Cafe Sci event , and that body is standing unabashedly naked in the Gundersons ' lab .
His shiny exterior skin has yet to be fabricated , so his internal tangle of wire and circuit boards is exposed to the world — in his underwear , as Louise says .
Next , he scans through his memory , how the Gundersons have been having him roll this way and that , practicing his obstacle avoidance so he 'll be prepared for the Wynkoop 's crowded confines .
" Initialized episodic memory , " he says when he 's done , but then seems to realize something .
He vividly recalls where he was the last time he was operational , but Lord knows if he 's still there .
" Where am I ? " he asks , almost nervously .
The Gundersons tell him by typing the answer into his computer .
Ah .
The lab .
He knows the lab , the Gamma Two headquarters appropriately located in the Bolt Factory Lofts , a renovated bolt manufacturing plant on South Kalamath Street .
If he had nostrils , he'd whiff the aroma of brewing beer wafting over from the nearby Breckenridge Brewery mixed with roasting coffee beans from Dazbog Coffee .
He knows this chic industrial space decorated with old toy robots like the back of his non-existent hand ; how the two computer workstations , desks covered by sheets of paper tattooed with penciled - in equations and graphs , stand at one side of the room while the mini-machine shop , the work bench and tool cabinet and shelves of electronic miscellanea , occupies the other .
In between , he 's free to roam about ; the only place that 's off limits is the second - level office , where bookshelves overflow with treatises on computer programming and neurophysiology , and that 's only because he can't navigate stairs .
Yet .
Assured everything is in its proper place , the little guy is ready to roll .
" My name is Basil , " he declares .
" What do you want me to do ? "
Basil is confident there are people in the room to instruct him .
He knows what people look like and that he 's supposed to serve them and that he should n't run into them .
But he has no idea what these particular people plan to teach him today , a list of Cafe Sci-specific functions listed on one of the lab 's dry erase boards :
" Apologize to people . "
" Ask for beer . "
" Do n't trip . "
And since he does n't have ears , he can't follow their conversations , a heady concoction of computer science , electrical engineering , neurology , psychology , philosophy and sociology , topped with a dollop of science fiction — but then again , even the average human would have a hard time keeping up .
His memory of these folks is spotty at best .
He 's pretty certain they 're not standing exactly where he remembers they were the last time he was operational , since he's aware that people are more transient than , say , one of the lab chairs , which sometimes get moved , not to mention the walls or workstations , which he knows never move .
But he draws a blank about their personal lives , their background and motivations .
He knows nothing of how Louise , then a chemistry undergrad at the University of California , Berkeley , met Jim at the San Francisco magic shop where he was working in 1977 or how they hit it off over discussions of Einstein 's gravitational - field theory .
It was a match made in intellectual heaven .
" If these two get together and start something , everybody had better stand back , ' " Robin Felder , a pathology and chemistry professor at the University of Virginia , remembers thinking about the two former UVA grad students .
" My mind does n't completely comprehend how that much intelligence can interact . "
Gamma
Two , which uses the Greek word for the letter G to reference its founders , Gunderson and Gunderson , is dotted with examples of the couple 's accomplishments , beyond the two Ph.D.s , two master 's and three bachelor 's degrees they boast between them .
On the wall , near a poster of a drunken robot that reads " A sober robot can't do his job .
He depends on your beer ! " is a patent for an automated medical - sample freezer Jim designed ; its robotic machinery operates at - 80 degrees Celsius .
And in the corner , there 's Kitty , a low - cost hazmat - monitoring robot they developed — built into a blazing pink Barbie Power Wheels car .
Basil is just a few months old ( " I went into service on October 15 , 2008 , at the Gamma Two Facility in Denver , Colorado , USA , Earth , " he 'll say in an ode to HAL 9000 , the creepy supercomputer in 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) .
And he 's only a hodgepodge of parts from Home Depot and Radio Shack , a thrifty provenance that 's allowed the Gundersons to work on him for four years using savings from lucrative past projects , such as the software they developed that played the stock market for hedge fund managers .
But simple little Basil could be their most important creation .
" Our motivation is , ' Where is my robot ? " explains Jim .
" For fifty years , sixty years , they 've been promising us our robots .
The personal servants who are going to clean our house , walk the dog , do all that kind of stuff .
We want Rosie from the Jetsons . "
The Gundersons are n't the only ones who dream of a servicebot .
As the baby boomers shuffle into their golden years , helpful automatons that allow the elderly to live at home longer could prove to be hugely cost - effective , given the price of nursing homes .
But until now , no one 's figured out how to make such robots work , despite the fact that the world already has the hardware to do it .
On one side are the amazing bots that stick to simple tasks .
An automated car built at Stanford University made headlines in 2005 , for instance , by winning a driverless - car competition , successfully navigating a 132 - mile off - road course in under seven hours .
Then there are the 2.5 million Roombas , the robotic vacuum cleaners that scurry about floors all over the world .
On the other side are the computers with robust artificial intelligence .
In 1997 , Deep Blue , a chess - playing computer , beat world champion Garry Kasparov and became the best player in the world .
And Jim , for his dissertation , developed a computer program that could deliberate .
When given a task , the software cycled through every action it knew how to do , picked the most suitable ones and figured out in what order to do them .
But when such AI is installed on robots tasked with getting stuff done in the real world , things get messy .
Deep Blue , for example , knows how to move a knight piece on a chess board better than any human , but it does n't actually know what a knight is — or , for that matter , where to find such a piece in a cluttered cabinet full of board games .
" We want robots that we can tell what to do and they 'll figure out how do to it , and if something goes wrong , they 'll figure out how to fix it or come back and ask for help , " says Jim .
" Complications , no problem .
Changes with the world , no problem . "
So far , that goal 's been a pipe dream .
That is , the Gundersons say , until Basil came along .
There 's a problem .
Not a big problem , but a problem .
It 's just two weeks before the Cafe Sci meeting at the Wynkoop , and Basil is completely lost .
He 's still moving around , rumbling from one point to the next when he 's told to , but he never ends up at the place in the lab where he thinks he is .
The Gundersons know his location is off because they 've measured out the distances in their lab to the millimeter .
So they stay hunched over their computers , tinkering with code before plugging Basil in and downloading minute revisions .
But the glitch wo n't go away ; every time they seem to iron out one wrinkle , another one pops up .
It 's one of the many headaches of nuts - and - bolts robotics — while purely software - based artificial - intelligence programmers can run thousands of software tests to root out bugs almost instantaneously , fixing Basil means endless hours of slow , careful trials .
After the latest round of fiddling , Basil seems more perplexed than ever .
When directed to move across the room , he turns a bit and shuffles forward a few inches — then stops .
" What would you like me to do ? " he asks , believing he 's somehow teleported himself clear across the workspace .
" That 's even weirder , " remarks Louise , sipping a cup of smoky oolong tea — the couple 's umpteenth of the day .
" I must have really broken something . "
Over the lab speakers , a chipper Christmas tune plays — one of many the " Personal DJ " software the two designed has been spinning lately .
The AI program has learned enough about the couple 's musical tastes to mix things up , but ever since Jim , in a bout of seasonal cheer , uploaded a bunch of holidays tunes , it just can't seem to help itself .
" Golly , golly , golly , " says Jim , who is wearing one of his endless variations of vests with a button - down shirt .
They 'd finally got Basil 's internal compass working , and now this .
They have n't even begun to teach him what a bar is or how , in order to obtain beer there , he first needs to get money , know how many beers to order , get himself to the bar and know what kind of beer to ask for ( the Gundersons prefer stout ) .
It looks like there wo n't be time now to add a voice interface before the show , so they 'll have to make do with commanding Basil via a wireless keyboard .
And do n't even get them started on the fact that Basil 's wheels keep falling off .
Still , all things considered , they 're relatively calm .
" We 're those evil science types , " jokes Jim .
" We do n't have feelings . "
Or maybe it 's because Basil , despite the current setback , already has the ability to identify , reason about and then interact with items he may find in a bar — a feat that his creators believe is the hardest problem of all .
To figure out how to make Basil do this , the couple pondered some of the most advanced robots around , like unmanned military airplanes and the Mars rovers .
These machines handle complex tasks with ease because they rely on a human — someone watching video feeds and identifying for the robot what objects are relevant to its mission and how to handle unexpected developments and so on .
The Gundersons were very familiar with this sort of tele - operated robot , having strapped a video camera to a remote - control car and remotely chased cats around their back yard for kicks .
But what , exactly , did they , the humans , bring to this person - robot relationship ?
Their contribution , the Gundersons decided , was helping the robot simplify and understand all the miscellaneous data with which it 's bombarded at any given moment .
" It occurred to us that the key thing that we are doing is taking the little dots on the video screens and turning them into ' chair legs ' and ' doorways ' and ' cats ' and then coming up with a plan about them , " says Jim .
It 's as if people are living in simplified virtual realities , where they filter out the vast majority of information around them — light gradients and subtle odors and ambient sounds — and just focus on basic abstract concepts .
The Gundersons found a quote from twentieth - century philosopher C.I. Lewis that put it well : " We do not see patches of color , but trees and houses ; we hear , not indescribable sound , but voices and violins . "
The Gundersons call this process " reification , " a term they borrowed from philosophy , meaning to mistake an abstract idea for a real thing .
They believed they could mathematically model it .
If they could program a robot to symbolically identify objects by focusing on just a few key attributes , like basic shapes and sizes , and ignore everything else — just as people do — the machine would be much more adept at navigating its complex and dynamic world .
Furthermore , since the robot would be able to recognize objects in his surroundings , the Gundersons could teach it basic attributes of these objects so it did n't see them as general obstacles or targets , but as abstract concepts like people and chairs — abstract concepts that computers are good at reasoning about .
Finally , such a robot would be able to store in its memory a basic symbolic mock - up of what these objects look like and where they 're located so it would n't have to continuously rebuild its concept of the world every time it moved or interacted with it .
Reification , the two believed , was the missing piece between advanced robotics technologies and artificial intelligence .
They wrote their new book all about it , but they still had to prove it worked .
How do you code something humans do without thinking ?
How do you figure out which aspects of a chair a robot should focus on to determine that it is , in fact , a chair ?
The answer was in teaching the robot to look for the most simple clues imaginable — that a lamp emits light , for example , or that a person has two legs .
The Gundersons purposely designed Basil as primitively ( and inexpensively ) as possible , opting for sonars over video cameras because they figured if they could get reification working on a system as basic as this , they could do it anywhere .
The first trials , however , failed miserably .
Jim , using drawing software , sketched up a beautiful three - dimensional model of a chair and uploaded it into Basil 's brain — but the robot could n't , for the artificial life of him , identify chairs in the lab .
The problem , they discovered , was the vagaries of the image captured by the sonars never looked like the perfectly designed chair model — so , says Louise , they decided , " Why do n't we just have the robot record what it sees ? "
They instructed him to take sonar image after sonar image of a wooden lab chair , capturing how it appeared from every angle .
Then they spent days poring over the data , identifying basic characteristic patterns , like how the chair is waist high and always has legs and a straight back — basic patterns Basil could use to determine whether a given object is a wooden chair .
Then , with the work finished this past June , they wheeled a chair in front of Basil and asked him what he saw .
Using the chipper dialogue they 'd programmed , he announced , " Ooh , I see a wooden chair . "
The regulars that night at the Denver Press Club , the Gundersons ' favorite bar , did n't know what to make of the two scientists throwing down beers and dancing around chanting , " The robot saw a wooden chair ! "
But that 's because they had no idea what this development meant : Reification worked .
And with that , this tiny robotics lab started making waves .
" The reification work they have done is unique .
There has n't been a book on the subject anywhere else , and I consider them leaders in their field , " says Raj Madhavan , a researcher at the Intelligent Systems Division at the National Institute of Standards & Technology in Gaithersburg , Maryland .
" And some of the things they have been doing , the reification work , had n't been implemented on a robot , per se .
They have what looks like a toy robot , but it has a cybernetic brain design . "
Soon Basil was n't just identifying wooden chairs , but other types of chairs — followed by tables and even people .
Now when the Gundersons show him a chair he 's never seen before , he 's can figure out that it 's probably a chair and definitely not , say , a person or a table .
Once the couple repairs Basil 's little mobility problem , they expect him to be able to approach an unknown object , mosey around , scrutinize it for a bit , then place a basic mental model of the object in its memory for later use .
Basil , in other words , will be able to learn on his own .
The members of the Friends of Basil can hardly contain their enthusiasm .
It 's T - minus four days until Cafe Sci , and the excited crew hovers around Basil , screwing in components and cracking Star Wars jokes .
When they step back , the robot 's dressed head to theoretical toe in gleaming , marbleized aluminum .
" Ta da ! " says professional jeweler Guyotte Williams , whom , as the designer of Basil 's outfit , the Gundersons call the world 's first robot aesthetician .
" Damn , he scrubs up nice , " says John Morse , a machine shop owner who runs the Grand National Critter Crunch Tournament , a local robotics competition .
" This is a momentous occasion , " adds Louise as the team imagines other dress styles , such as a black - velvet Basil for Elvis lovers .
The robot still has a few programming kinks , but as Christian Brown , a maintenance supervisor at the University of Colorado Denver who 's the team 's so - called chief roboticist puts it , " Even if he does n't deliver the beer , people will say he looks good . "
Basil has to look good ; it 's part of the Gundersons ' marketing plan .
The couple 's nest egg is n't going to subsidize their research forever , and , as Louise says , " We gotta find a way to fund this .
We 're addicted to this stuff . "
So sometime next year , they 'll start advertising Basil construction kits in publications like Robot magazine and Make magazine so that tinkerers the world over can build their very own reifying robot .
Then , a few months later , Gamma
Two will hit the cocktail - party industry with the unveiling of hors d'oeuvre - serving Basils .
And no one 's going to want a canape from an ugly bot .
Hence Basil 's glossy , stylish and , most important , completely non-humanoid look .
" There 's something about robots , a certain creepy factor , " explains Morse .
" If they 're humanoid but not quite human , people stand off from them . "
He 's referring to the phenomenon of human facsimiles , such as robots and animated figures , becoming more disturbing as they become more lifelike .
It 's why a roaming tabletop like Basil seems cute , while the hyper - realistic human animations in the computer - animated film Polar Express , for example , are downright disturbing .
It 's also in the spirit of positive human - robot relations that the Gundersons refer to Basil as a guy .
They 're not in danger of mistaking him for a friend — they promise they 'll have no problem killing him if he stops working right — but they do believe that slapping a gender on him will help him fit in with those who care about such things .
" He is designed to function in a world that is shared with humans , " explains Jim .
" People are going to build human models of what he is doing . "
And there was no question about Basil 's sex .
The way he aggressively zooms up to people without regard to personal space , he has to be a man .
A pretentious European man , to be exact , considering how his stiff mannerisms suggest he likes to haughtily turn on his heel and huff away .
That 's why he has a snooty name like Basil .
When the Friends of Basil finally quit fawning over the robot's new clothes , it 's on to the next order of business : planning the upcoming Gamma
Two online marketing video , " Basil Nabs a Burglar . "
The Gundersons have discovered their creation may have another application .
Since Basil 's sonar allows him to see perfectly in the dark and because he knows when objects around him are removed , he 'd make a great security bot .
To promote this concept , Friends of Basil member Ken Byles , the robot 's videographer , will film a sketch in which Basil discovers a bandit in the lab , remotely calls the cops , and then , when the scofflaw attempts to flee , warns him , " Do n't make me tase you . "
It 's a good thing the Gundersons always keep a bottle of champagne chilling in their home fridge .
Tonight calls for a celebration .
" We 're ecstatic , " says Jim , before stepping out the back door of their Denver bungalow and popping the bottle 's cork into the night .
At the lab today at about 4:30 p.m. , with just one day left before the Cafe Sci event , they asked Basil to deliver tea to them — and he did it .
Yes , they had to place the teapot on his tray after he popped into the lab 's kitchen to get it , and they had to pour it themselves once he presented it to them , but that 's just because he does n't have arms yet .
The point is , the bugs are gone .
He works .
Now all they have to do is replace the tea with a nice frothy beer , and the sky 's the limit .
First the Wynkoop , then the world .
Yes , many challenges lie ahead , like replacing Basil 's sonars with much more complicated video cameras , making sure he does n't get overwhelmed by all the different objects he 'll have to eventually identify and figuring out the mind - bending dilemma of teaching a robot to understand informal English .
But they 're cautiously optimistic .
" Everyone wants to leave a legacy , " says Louise ; maybe this will be theirs .
" If we 're really lucky , Basil will be as influential as an Apple , " she adds as they sit by the fireplace , sipping bubbly .
So let 's say the Gundersons do deliver the handy - dandy robot everyone 's always wanted .
Is that necessarily a good thing ?
For starters , the specter of people using such machines for bad purposes — programming suicide - bomber Basils , for example — gives Louise heartburn , to put it mildly .
And what about the helpful bots Basil could spawn , the ones that learn to complete any task , large or small :
Will they enrich people 's lives or just make everyone super lazy ?
The television remote control led to the couch potato , and the Internet gave rise to the web addict .
Will a real live Rosie the Robot Maid turn everyone into the blubbery do - nothings depicted in the movie WALL-E ?
The Gundersons have thought long and hard about these questions , and they 're not ones to take the social ramifications of new technologies lightly .
In their own home , they 're only willing to embrace new gizmos if they 're sure the benefits outweigh the disadvantages .
By the time they were ready to purchase a VCR , for example , the technology had given way to DVD players .
And other than an in - home version of their Personal DJ software , all of their robots are reserved for the lab .
But the Gundersons are optimistic that one day soon , they and many others will welcome Basil 's ilk into their homes , and it wo n't be the end of productive civilization .
Sure , " some people are going to turn into lumps , " but they 'll be outnumbered by all the people who really need robotic helpers , Louise says , folks like the Gundersons ' ninety - year - old acquaintance who , when she learned about the couple 's preliminary work on Basil , remarked , " Why did n't you start working on this twenty years ago ?
I need this now . "
Best of all , say the Gundersons , this brave new roboticized world will let folks focus on the finer things in life .
In their own case , maybe they 'll get back into chasing tornados , a hobby they pursued for five years not just for the thrill of it , but for the near - impossible mathematical challenge of predicting where the twisters were going to hit .
Or maybe they 'll hit something else on their to - do list , like visiting a live volcano .
And if their grand plan fails ?
" We 'll have robots panhandle for us on street corners , " says Jim .
" They 'll have signs that say ' Will work for voltage . ' "
Basil 's coming - out party at the Wynkoop bolsters that old cardinal rule in robotics :
Live demos do n't go as planned .
Things start off promisingly .
Halfway through the presentation , Jim says to Louise , " Let 's ask him for some beer and see what happens . "
She types on Basil 's wireless keyboard , and he dutifully asks how many beers and what type .
Then , after remembering to request some money , he trundles off toward the bar .
Unfortunately , still twenty feet away , he slows down .
Then slows some more .
Finally , he stops completely .
Another glitch ?
Not this time .
It turns out the Gundersons left Basil on too long , and he 's running out of juice .
Soon , his sonars start flickering , as does the computer screen on his backside .
" This , " Jim announces matter - of - factly , " is Basil starving to death . "
" Awwww , " exclaims the audience as Louise hits the " off " switch — but no one seems too put out .
After all , the Gundersons ' account of their work has enough whiz - bang moments even without a beer - slinging robot .
Jim , his days on a magic stage shining through , has the crowd from the get - go when he inquires , " How many of you have asked , ' Where 's my robot ? ' " — and nearly every hand shoots up .
Later , the awe in the room is almost palpable when he says , to help explain reification , " We do n't live in the real world .
We are all living in a fantasy world .
You are living in a model of the real world . "
They finish to rousing applause .
As audience members surge forward to inspect Basil , Louise takes stock of the event .
No , she 's not too disappointed : " Because we were working on a deadline , it forced us to get a lot done . "
Now , thanks to the inspiration of Cafe Sci , they know Basil 's brain works perfectly .
He 's been delivering tea all around the lab , not to mention a few beers .
The mistake tonight was n't the robot's , it was the stupid humans ' .
Plus , it 's great to see her scientific peers fawning over Basil .
" We work in isolation , " she says , " So it 's nice to hear it 's cool . "
Still , the two are already pondering their next assignments .
They have to teach Basil to recognize specific rooms , so he does n't keep asking where he is all the time .
And he has to get real peepers , in the form of video cameras .
Finally , there 's his graduation assignment : Roll down the street to Breckenridge Brewery and bring back a growler .
Of course , before all that , says Louise , " we have to re-think batteries . "
But that 's all for another day .
Right now , the Gundersons and the Friends of Basil head for the bar .
It 's time for a beer .
This time , they 'll get it themselves .
Wachovia is pleased Citigroup will not stop it merging with Wells Fargo .
US financial giant Citigroup says it will not seek to bar Wells Fargo from taking over troubled bank Wachovia .
Citigroup said it was walking away from talks aimed at dividing up Wachovia 's assets with rival Wells Fargo .
However , Citigroup said it would still seek damages from the two banks over its thwarted attempt to secure Wachovia 's banking operations .
Hit hard by the credit crisis , Wachovia was keen secure what it saw as the better offer from Wells Fargo .
" Citi believes that it has strong legal claims against Wachovia , Wells Fargo and their officers , directors , advisors and others for breach of contract , " the US banking group said in a statement .
" However , Citigroup has decided not to ask that the Wells Fargo - Wachovia merger be enjoined . "
Wachovia said it was pleased that Citigroup was ending its efforts to stop it merging with Wells Fargo .
Danger
Wachovia , the fourth largest US bank , had been in danger of failure after its share price fell by more than 70 % .
Citigroup stepped in with a bid of $ 2.2 bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) in stock for Wachovia 's banking activities .
The offer also covered $ 42bn of Wachovia 's $ 312bn losses , with the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation absorbing the rest .
However , Wells Fargo later made a rival bid of $ 15 bn in an all - stock deal to buy all of Wachovia , stressing its proposal involved no government intervention or taxpayer risk .
Waterpod Floating House Points to a Nomadic Future After Global Warming
December 16th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Most scientists are now in agreement that global warming is happening , and that , in the not too distant future , we may all have to get used to living in a world of mass species exctinctions , population explosion , resource scarcity and rising oceans .
The question on many people ’s lips is , how will mankind adapt to this drastically different future world ?
One possible solution to this dilemma has come from a collective of New York based artists , who have proposed a mass shift towards a waterborne , nomadic existence .
In May 2009 , the team will launch a new work called Waterpod , a floating eco-habitat designed to support a fully sustainable community ( more pics after the jump ) .
The Waterpod is a triple - domed island , built from a combination of recycled wood , metal , plastic , fabric and other materials , sitting astride an industrial barge .
As well as being a living space , the 80 x 25 feet construction is designed to house community and artistic activity and a range of eco-initiatives , including food grown with purified water from the Hudson River , vertical agriculture and alternative energy .
The structure will be powered by a hybrid solar / wind system that will also run all on - board equipment .
Following the launch from Newtown Creek between Brooklyn and Queens , the Waterpod will navigate alomg the East River to New York Harbor , stopping at each of the five boroughs , as well as several Manhattan piers on the Hudson River and beyond .
Although the Waterpod will initially function as a single , stand alone unit , the team envisage the project expanding into “ ever - evolving water communities ; an archipelagos that has the ability to mutate with the tides . ”

What do surfing and roping have in common ?
In my experience , finding success in both stems from time spent “ paddling out . ”
While living in California , I enjoyed getting on my longboard now and again to try and catch a wave . …
A University of Iowa researcher and colleagues at the University of Michigan have discovered a direct link between disruption of a critical cellular housekeeping process and fatty liver disease , a condition that causes fat to accumulate in the liver .
The findings , published in the Dec. 9 issue of the journal Developmental Cell , might open new avenues for understanding and perhaps treating fatty liver disease , which is the most common form of liver disease in the Western world and may affect as many as one in three American adults .
Although fatty liver itself does not necessarily cause illness , it is associated with serious conditions like diabetes , metabolic syndrome , cirrhosis of the liver and liver failure .
The study , led by Tom Rutkowski , Ph.D. , assistant professor of anatomy and cell biology at the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine , and Randal Kaufman , Ph.D. , professor of biological chemistry and internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School , shows that disrupted protein folding causes fatty liver in mice .
The finding is the first to demonstrate a direct link between this form of cellular stress and abnormal fat metabolism .
Protein folding , which occurs in a cellular compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , is a vital cellular process because proteins must be correctly folded into defined three - dimensional shapes in order to function .
Unfolded or misfolded proteins are a sign of cellular stress and can cause serious problems -- misfolded proteins cause amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer 's disease .
Cells rely on a very sensitive system known as the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) to guard against the cellular stress caused by protein folding problems .
To investigate how cells adapt to stress , the researchers created mice that were missing one component of the UPR .
Under normal conditions , mice with the genetic mutation looked and behaved normally .
However , the mutated mice were much less able to cope with cellular stress caused by disrupted protein folding than wild - type mice .
In addition , the team found that protein misfolding caused fatty liver in mice with the mutation .
" We did not set out to understand fatty liver disease , " said Rutkowski , who was a postdoctoral researcher in Kaufman 's University of Michigan lab when the study was done .
" We were really trying to understand the basic biology of how cells respond to stress , and through our approach to that fundamental question we were able to identify a connection to a condition that is of enormous importance to human health .
" When we realized that our experiments to investigate protein folding abnormalities were producing fatty liver disease as a consequence , it tied in with previous circumstantial evidence suggesting that ER stress might be involved in the liver 's role in fat metabolism , " he added .
The researchers followed up on the result and found that mice also developed fatty liver if their ability to fold proteins in the ER was genetically impaired , even when the UPR was functionally intact .
This result suggested that the UPR is able to protect the liver against ER stress to a certain degree , but that fatty liver will result when the stress is too severe .
Further analysis of the mice models identified some of the genes that connect prolonged ER stress with faulty fat metabolism in the liver .
In particular , the team found that unresolved ER stress leads to persistent expression of a gene called CHOP and that leads to changes in expression of fat metabolism genes .
Mice with no CHOP were partially protected from fatty liver .
The results suggest that it is not disruption of a specific protein that caused fatty liver , but rather anything that perturbs the ER 's ability to fold proteins correctly that is important .
If this finding holds true for fatty liver disease in humans , therapies aimed at improving protein folding in the ER , or inhibiting CHOP , could help treat the condition .
" Our study does prove that perturbing protein folding can lead to fatty liver , " Rutkowski said .
" The next step is to investigate whether real physiological stresses like chronic alcohol consumption , obesity and viral infection also lead to fatty liver disease through protein folding problems in the ER . "
###
In addition to Rutkowski and Kaufman , who also is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator , key members of the research team included Jun Wu , Ph.D. , who was a graduate student at University of Michigan Medical Center , and Mahmood Hussain , Ph.D. , at State University of New York Downstate Medical Center .
Researchers from the University of Michigan Medical Center ; the University of Washington , Seattle , Wash . ; and Wayne State University , Detroit , Mich. , also were involved in the study .
The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health

A new study ( PDF ) in the Journal of Experimental Psychology suggests that – gasp !
– talking on a cell phone while driving might actually be dangerous .
Sure , the conclusion is kind of a no - brainer , but the heart of the experiment was to figure out if there ’s any difference between chatting with someone on a hands - free phone and chatting with a passenger in the car with you .
After all , it seems like the mechanics are basically the same …
Wrong !
According to the study ( which used 41 drivers ) , talking on the phone made a significant impact on driving , causing them to drift lanes , miss exits , and just generally drive like the jerks that make you yell “ GET OFF THE FREAKING PHONE ! ” to people in front of you in traffic–even without having a phone in their hands .
Meanwhile , talking to a passenger in the car had little or no impact .
This fits perfectly with my theory that talking on a cell phone actually actively sucks away at your brain cells .
Okay , maybe not …
Actually , if you stop to think about it , the findings do make some intuitive sense .
It seems to me like an issue of presence–even if you ’re talking to someone , if they ’re there with you in the car , your attention is still there in the car .
The researchers from the study suggest that the driver may even be getting conversational cues about the surrounding traffic from the passenger .
After all , your mother sitting on her front porch on her phone is n’t going to shriek , “ OH MY GOD , YOU NEARLY CLIPPED THAT 18 - WHEELER , ” at you while you ’re talking to her while driving .
Strangely enough , the study does n’t address people who text message or check their email while driving .
I suspect this is because they ’ve all been in horrible traffic accidents already .

Documents released today by a congressional committee investigating the collapse of insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) paint a picture of a company that sought to conceal the scope of its risky investments , despite warnings from regulators , auditors , and even its own employees that its financial disclosures were insufficient .
According to a letter ( PDF ) released Tuesday by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , which held a hearing on the firm ’s downfall , federal regulators warned AIG executives of a “ material weakness ” in the company ’s books five months before the insurance giant had to be rescued by an $ 85 billion government bailout .
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) wrote AIG on March 10 , 2008 that its asset valuations “ lacked the accuracy and granularity necessary to understand the impact … on AIG ’s accounting and financial reporting . ”
AIG ’s auditor , Pricewaterhouse Cooper ( PWC ) , also warned the insurance giant about its books .
Oversight committee chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) pointed to minutes ( PDF ) from an AIG audit committee meeting in March indicating the board was told that the “ root cause ” of AIG ’s problems was internal auditors ’ lack of “ appropriate access ” to the Financial Products division — the very division whose massive losses eventually necessitated the $ 85 billion government bailout .
And even AIG ’s own employees warned the company that it had no way of knowing how much risk it was exposed to .
In a letter ( PDF ) to the committee , Joseph St. Denis , the firm ’s former vice president for accounting policy in AIG ’s Financial Products division , accused AIG executives of stymieing his attempts to make sure the company was properly reporting the liabilities stemming from its involvement in risky financial products , including the $ 62 billion credit derivative swap ( CDS ) market .
St. Denis , who worked as a Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) enforcement official before joining AIG , said Joseph Cassano , the head of the division , “ took actions that I believed were intended to prevent me from performing the job duties for which I was hired . ”
Lynn Turner , a former chief accountant for the SEC who testified at the hearing , said he did n’t see how AIG ’s financial disclosures could possibly be consistent with its exposure .
“ When you ’ve got that sort of exposure , you owe it to me as an investor [ to disclose it ] .
That ’s the disclosure I cannot find in these filings … .
There ’s a question there as to why we did n’t get that . ”
In light of the evidence , a bipartisan chorus of lawmakers was quick to condemn the former AIG CEOs who had been asked to testify .
“ Quite frankly , based on a lot of the decisions you made , you deserved to fail , ” Rep .
Tom Davis , the committee ’s ranking Republican , told Martin Sullivan , the doomed insurance company ’s CEO until June 2008 .
Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - N.Y. ) , was just as harsh , telling the AIG execs that they had “ cost my constituents and the taxpayers of this country $ 85 billion and run into the ground one of the most respected insurance companies in the history of our country ” by “ just gambling billions , possibly trillions of dollars . ”
Sullivan and Robert Willumstad , who served as AIG ’s chairman and CEO from June until mid-September 2008 , blamed obscure accounting rules and actions taken before their time at the firm ’s helm for the company ’s collapse .
The buck - passing was mutual .
While AIG ’s longest - serving chief executive , Maurice “ Hank ” Greenberg , was unable to attend the hearing due to illness , he took care to attack Sullivan and Willumstad ( although not by name ) in his written testimony ( PDF ) .
Tuesday ’s hearing was the second in a series of five scheduled to investigate the ongoing financial crisis , and it bore many similarities to Monday ’s hearing , which investigated the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Bothers .
Like Lehman ’s CEO Richard Fuld Jr. , who testified Monday , Sullivan and Willumstad spoke of a financial “ tsunami ” that could not have been anticipated and a “ crisis of confidence ” that took everyone by surprise .
“ The AIG CEOs are like the Lehman CEO in one other key respect , ” Waxman said .
“ In each case , they refuse to accept any blame for what happened to their companies . ”
But while there was bipartisan agreement among committee members that the former AIG CEOs deserved much of the blame for the firm ’s near - collapse , under the surface unity a bitter partisan battle over the causes of the crisis was stewing .
Republicans tend to place a lot of the blame for the current crisis on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) that owned or guaranteed a huge percentage of America ’s home loans .
Rep. John Mica ( R - Fla . ) called Fannie
Mae the “ core perpetrator of all this . ”
The GOP is frustrated that Waxman has not yet scheduled hearings to investigate Fannie and Freddie ’s role in the crisis , although the chairman promised on Tuesday that such a hearing would be forthcoming .
So far denied a separate hearing on Fannie and Freddie , Republicans decided to ask questions about the mortgage giants anyway .
But their line of questioning did n’t get far with the former AIG execs .
Asked by Davis if they saw any connection between AIG ’s collapse and Fannie and Freddie ’s problems , both Sullivan and Willumstad gave answers that amounted to long versions of “ no . ”
Members of the GOP do n’t think Fannie and Freddie alone caused the crisis .
They also blame an accounting rule called “ mark - to - market ” or “ fair value ” accounting , which requires that companies list assets in their books at their real market value , whether or not they have any plans to sell the assets and actually realize a profit or loss .
In this , the GOP has CEOs on their side : Sullivan , Willumstad , and Greenberg all claimed fair value accounting contributed to AIG ’s downfall by causing ratings agency downgrades and , subsequently , a downward spiral in the company ’s stock value .
Turner , the former SEC accountant , defended mark - to - market in a section of his written testimony titled “ Do n’t Shoot the Messenger , ” arguing that simply changing disclosure rules would not have changed the fact that the market for mortgage - backed securities has essentially dried up .
Rep. Maloney accused Sullivan and Willumstad of “ blam[ing ] accountants for saying a product has no value when no one wants to buy it . ”
In contrast to the Republicans ’ fixation on Fannie , Freddie , and fair value accounting , the Democrats have focused on credit derivative swaps as the salient issue in this crisis .
Credit derivative swaps are unregulated bets on whether or not companies will default on debt .
They were originally designed as a form of insurance , or hedging , but now only a small percentage of the $ 62 trillion swap market is backed by collateral .
( Since $ 62 trillion is close to the combined annual economic output of the entire world , the lack of collateral is understandable ) .
AIG ’s financial products division had sold billions of dollars in swaps before 2005 , when they halted the practice .
But when AIG ’s credit ratings were lowered in 2008 , the company had to post enormous amounts of collateral for credit default swaps that it had previously held with low collateral or collateral - free .
The need to raise this collateral soon led to the government bailout .
Eric Dinallo , the Insurance Superintendent for New York State , argued before the committee that the credit default swap market has to be regulated , calling it a “ major contributor to the emerging financial crisis . ”
Asked if the unregulated swap market “ could bring down our entire economy , ” Dinallo said , “ Well , we ’ll see . ”
In the meantime , SEC Chairman Christopher Cox has already asked for the power to regulate the market .
It was a testimony to the damage the credit derivative swap market has wrought that even the former AIG CEOs have come around to the idea of regulating it .
Both Sullivan and Willumstad said under questioning that they would prefer if the market were regulated .
“ With benefit of hindsight , if there is good regulation that could be put in place …
I would support that , ” Sullivan said .

Revolutionary Road by Richard Yates VIntage
The thumbnail social history of the United States , as Godfrey Hodgson ( the author of America in Our Time ) once phrased it to me , is as follows : agrarian population moves as soon as it can to the cities , and then consummates the process by evacuating the cities for the suburbs .
More Americans now live in the suburbs than anywhere else , and more do so by choice .
Anachronisms of two kinds persist in respect of this phenomenon .
The first is the apparently unshakable belief of political candidates that they will sound better , and appear more authentic , if they can claim to come from a small town ( something we were almost spared this year , until the chiller from Wasilla ) .
The second is the continued stern disapproval of anything “ suburban ” by the strategic majority of our country ’s intellectuals .
The idiocy of rural life ?
If you must .
The big city ?
All very well .
Bohemia , or perhaps Paris or Prague ?
Yes indeed .
The suburbs ?
No thank you .
The achievement of Richard Yates ’s Revolutionary Road was to anatomize the ills and woes of suburbia while simultaneously satirizing those suburbanites and others who thought that they themselves were too good for the ’ burbs .
It is also the reason why the novel can seem , and in the literal sense is , dated .
Published in 1961 and set in 1955 , this psychodrama of an ambitiously named development in Connecticut ( the source of Yates ’s superbly misleading title ) recalls us to the period that saw the publication of David Riesman ’s The Lonely Crowd ( 1950 ) , Sloan Wilson ’s novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit ( 1955 ) , the pop sociology of men like William H. Whyte and Vance Packard , whose critiques The Organization Man ( 1956 ) and The Hidden Persuaders ( 1957 ) made American business seem impersonal and cynical , and — if this is n’t too fanciful — Edward Albee ’s Who ’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? and Malvina Reynolds ’s song “ Little Boxes , ” both of which made their debut in 1962 .
Pete Seeger had a huge success of his own with the song , which ridiculed the harmless citizens of Daly City , California , and gave us the word ticky - tacky .
No less a man than Tom Lehrer was to say that it was “ the most sanctimonious song ever written , ” but this insight would be buried by later developments in the ’60s , when removal to the suburbs became a polite synonym for “ white flight ” ( see the mythscape of Jeffrey Eugenides ’s Detroit ) .
When Bertrand Russell published his first short - story collection , in 1953 , there was something predictable in the fact that it was titled Satan in the Suburbs and Other Stories .
Hollywood has since had considerable fun with that trope , and bids fair to do so again when Revolutionary Road comes to the screen , starring the Titanic duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet .
Big Brother police to get ' war - time ' power to demand ID in the street - on pain of sending you to jail
Checks :
Police will be able to demand ID from people at any time ( file picture )
State officials are to be given powers previously reserved for times of war to demand a person 's proof of identity at any time .
Anybody who refuses the Big Brother demand could face arrest and a possible prison sentence .
The new rules come in legislation unveiled in today 's Queen 's Speech .
They are presented as a crackdown on illegal immigration , but lawyers say they could be applied to anybody who has ever been outside the UK , even on holiday .
The civil rights group Liberty , which analysed clauses from the new Immigration and Citizenship Bill , called them an attempt to introduce compulsory ID cards by the back door .
The move would effectively take Britain back to the Second World War , when people were stopped and asked to ' show their papers ' .
Liberty said : ' Powers to examine identity documents , previously thought to apply only at ports of entry , will be extended to criminalise anyone in Britain who has ever left the country and fails to produce identity papers upon demand .
' We believe that the catch - all remit of this power is disproportionate and that its enactment would not only damage community relations but represent a fundamental shift in the relationship between the State and those present in the UK . '
One broadly - drafted clause would permit checks on anyone who has ever entered the
UK - whether recently or years earlier .
Officials , who could be police or immigration officers , will be able to stop anyone to establish if they need permission to be here , if they have it , and whether it should be cancelled .
No reasonable cause or suspicion is required , and checks can be carried out ' in country ' - not just at borders .
The law would apply to British citizens and foreign nationals , according to Liberty 's lawyers .
The only people who would be exempt are the tiny minority who have never been abroad on holiday or business .
A second clause says that people who are stopped ' must produce a valid identity document if required to do so by the Secretary of State ' .
Failure to do so would be a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of 51 weeks in jail or a £ 5,000 fine .
Opposed : Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti ( left ) and Tory MP Damian Green ( right ) both spoke out about the new powers
Currently , police are allowed to ask for identity documents only if there is a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed an offence .
During the Second World War , ID cards were seen as a way of protecting the nation from Nazi spies , but in 1952 Winston Churchill 's government decided they were not needed in peacetime .
They were thought to be hindering the police because so many people resented being asked to produce them .
Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti said last night : ' Sneaking in compulsory identity cards via the back door of immigration law is a cynical escalation of this expensive and intrusive scheme . '
Tory spokesman Damian Green said : ' This scheme will do nothing to improve our security , may make it worse , and will certainly land the taxpayer with a multi-million bill .
' Labour should concentrate on things that will improve our security , like a dedicated border police force . '
LibDem spokesman Chris Huhne said : ' Ministers seem to be breaking their promise that no one would ever have to carry an ID card .
This is a sly and underhand way of extending the ID card scheme by stealth . '
There was also concern last night that the Government is seeking to revive controversial plans for secret inquests .
The measure - which would have let the authorities hold a hearing like the Jean Charles de Menezes inquest behind closed doors - was removed from counter - terrorism legislation earlier this year .
But it could be re-introduced as part of a Coroners and Death Certification Bill .
Other Bills set to be unveiled include plans to extend flexible working and new laws giving every employee the right to request time off to train .
These have been widely criticised by business leaders who warn that extending employees rights will damage small firms .
Under a new welfare crackdown , benefit cheats will lose their handouts for one month and council staff will be given powers to use ' lie detector ' technology to root out fraudsters .
Dole claimants who refuse to seek work could be made to dig gardens as punishment or they may be ordered to spend an entire nine - to - five day in an office looking through vacant jobs .
Plans for a crackdown on cigarette sales are being reviewed , and a new statutory code of conduct to govern the banks has been added to the list of forthcoming Bills .
The Speech is reported to have undergone last - minute changes , driven by Business Secretary Peter Mandelson , to reflect the economic crisis .
But he is said to have failed in a bid to block health measures on tobacco sales .
Of the Bills dropped altogether , the most high - profile is the Communications Data Bill , which would have created a giant ' Big Brother ' database of phone calls , emails and internet visits .
The Home Office said last night it had no intention of making people carry ID cards .
A spokesman said : ' It is simply wrong to claim there are any plans whatsoever to make identity cards compulsory for British citizens or to require British citizens to have an ID card at all times and present it when asked .
' To maintain effective immigration control it is only right that we ask everyone attempting to enter the UK to produce a valid identity document . '
Every worker wins right to training
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has lost a battle against plans to give parents the right to flexible working
Ministers are to press ahead with a raft of new workplace rights in the Queen 's Speech , despite fears about the impact on businesses battling the recession .
Government sources said plans to extend flexible working have been revived and the country 's 22 million workers will get a new right to ask for time off to train .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has lost a battle against plans to give millions of parents the right to flexible working .
The flexible working scheme is now expected to be extended in April to 4.5 million parents of children up to the age of 16 .
Plans to extend paid maternity leave from 39 weeks to 52 weeks are also likely to go ahead .
The move will anger business leaders , who say extending employees ' rights will hit small firms .
The ' right to train ' , to be implemented in 2010 , will be less contentious as many businesses accept the need to improve employees ' skills , especially in difficult economic times .
A tighter rein on the banks
Banks will have to sign up to a compulsory code of practice under plans to be revealed in the Queen 's Speech .
It will tear up the voluntary ' Banking Code ' which has been in place since 1997 .
Key commitments will include ensuring charges are ' open and transparent ' and treating customers in financial difficulties in a ' sympathetic and positive ' way .
The move comes amid growing fury at the way banks are failing to keep their side of the bargain over the £ 37 billion Government bailout .
In a pre-emptive move , Lloyds TSB - one of the three banks being part - nationalised - will today launch a new charter for small businesses .
The six - point plan will only help businesses with an annual turnover of up to £ 1 million .
About 600,000 customers will benefit .
Lloyds said it will agree ' any reasonable request for short - term finance ' and promised to pass on the full benefit of any further cuts in Bank of England base rate .
It also promised not to change the interest rate or availability of an overdraft as long as the business does not exceed the agreed limit .

Ein für die EU - Kommission gefertigter Zwischenbericht zum Arzneimittelmarkt sieht eine erhebliche Behinderung des Wettbewerbs durch jene Konzerne , die sich selbst die " forschenden Pharmaunternehmen " nennen .
Wichtige Instrumente der Wettbewerbsblockierer seien der Mehrfachpatentschutz auf Medikamente , Prozesse gegen Generikahersteller und Stillhalteabkommen , bei denen jene Arzneimittelfirmen , die eigentlich billige Konkurrenzprodukte anbieten sollten , von den Herstellern der " Originale " dafür bezahlt werden , dies nicht oder nur verspätet zu tun .
Der Europäische Verband der Pharmaindustrie ( EFPIA ) meinte angesichts der im Bericht geäußerten Vorwürfe , die beanstandete " Bündelung " von Patenten sei " völlig berechtigt " , den schließlich gehe es ja um den zum Schutze von Investitionen und des " Geistigen Eigentums " .
EU - Wettbewerbskommissarin
Neelie Kroes kritisierte zwar , dass es " nach Missbrauch riechen " würde , " wenn eine Firma 1.300 Patente für ein einziges Medikament beantragt " , will aber trotzdem nichts von einer Änderung des Patentrechts wissen , die solch einen Missbrauch verhindern könnte .

Open Space sims and how Linden Lab got it right – for themselves
by Maximilian Proto , Department of Random Guy Posting
After Linden Lab introduced a new pricing policy for its highly popular Open Space ( OS ) sim product , residents joined to celebrate the cherished tradition of feverishly complaining about price increases ( “ they ’re making it too expensive ” ) , price decreases ( “ they ’re devaluating my investments ” ) , new product introductions ( “ they ’re hurting mainland owners with those islands ” ) , product changes ( “ they ’re are hurting island owners with those OS sims ” ) or even when Linden Lab does n’t do anything at all ( “ they ’re not doing anything at all ” ) .
But why did Linden Lab decide to respond with such a steep price increase for a highly successful product risking alienating their customer base ( further ) ?
In particular when the RL economy is on the brink of a recession ?
And would n’t Linden Lab suffer considerable losses if estate owners would really abandon their OS sims as a reaction ?
Unfortunately , the idea that JIRA issues or threats of abandoning sims will change Linden Lab ’s pricing plans is futile .
In fact , Linden Lab ’s move makes a lot of economic sense for the company , and even large scale abandoning of OS sims will likely have little to no impact on Linden Lab ’s financial performance .
And this is why :
It seems that OS sims turned out to be much less of a success to Linden Lab when they compared the profit and loss statement with that of standard sims .
Apparently , on a like - for - like basis the average operating costs of OS sims are considerably higher compared to standard sims which turns an OS sim into a lower margin product for Linden Lab .
Hence , Linden Lab decided to rectify this situation by introducing a pricing structure that deliberately reduces the incentive to purchase and maintain OS sims in order to make people chose standard sims instead that are generating higher margins for the company .
Obviously , Linden Lab ’s move ( understandably ) infuriates OS estate owners and leaves them with four basic options :
Option 1 : Keep going and pass the extra costs to tenants ( if they are in the land business ) , customers ( if they are in the content business ) or group members ( if they are a non-profit community ) .
Option 2 : Convert OS sims ( back ) into standard sims and hope to keep your tenants / customer / group members .
Option 3 : Give up and sell the OS sims to another resident .
All three options will have only very little impact on Linden Lab ’s revenues as they will continue to receive the tier payments for the sims .
In fact , they will get more revenues and better margins due to the increase in tier fee .
That leaves option 4 : Give up by simply abandoning the OS sims .
This is the most interesting option to look at – not only because the other three options are pretty straightforward but also because many estate owners are using the abandonment argument as a threat to convince Linden Lab to change its course .
Let ’s look what would happen to Linden Lab ’s revenue if OS estate owners would decide to abandon in droves and see if the company would be impressed .
In order to be able to do so , we need to make a few sensible assumptions and do a bit of math ( you have been warned ) :
1 . How many OS sims are there actually ?
When the new OS sims where introduced in spring this year the Second Life grid had about 14,600 islands .
By the end of October this number will be 27,000 , an increase of more than 12,000 .
Considering the popularity of OS sims , there may well be up to 10,000 of them on the grid by now .
2 . How much revenues is Linden Lab generating from those OS sims ?
Assuming roughly 10,000 OS sims , Linden Lab is currently generating monthly revenues of US $ 750,000 from those sims ( note 1 ) .
3 . What would happen if Linden Lab lost 50 % of all those OS sims as a result of the new pricing structure ?
Obviously , the effect of the new pricing structure and the adjustments to it will be felt over a certain period of time , probably up to 6 months .
Let ’s think a little about Linden Lab ’s revenue development over this period of time by making a few simplifying assumptions :
If Linden Lab had kept their pricing policy unchanged , they had 10,000 OS sims generating US $ 4,500,000 over 6 months ( note 2 ) .
If Linden Lab loses half of those OS sims as furious estate owners leave the grid and simply abandon their sims at the beginning of January Linden Lab ’s revenue will fall to US $ 3,750,000 ( note 3 ) .
This would be a shortfall of US $ 750,000 .
However , abandoning those 5,000 OS sims frees up server capacity for either 5,000 new OS sims or 1,250 standard sims .
Assuming that OS sims have fallen a bit out of favor , Linden Lab will now go and connect those 1,250 sims for a setup fee of US $ 1,000 each .
In addition , Linden Lab will generate tier revenue of US $ 295 per month from those newly connected sims .
How much tier revenue Linden Lab can generate in the first 6 months that we are looking at depends on how fast they can sell the freed up capacity .
Looking back in time , Linden Lab connected about 500 islands every month between October 2007 and March 2008 .
Let ’s be conservative , and assume they can connect the freed up server capacity at 250 sims per month .
Let ’s compare :
LL ’s total OS - related revenue H1-2009 under the old OS policy : US$ 4,500,000
LL ’s total OS - related revenue H1-2009 under the new OS policy + resell : US$ 6,106,250
Or in ( hopefully ) plain English : Even if Linden Lab lost half of all their OS sims as the result of their price increase , they would still end up with more than US $ 1,600,000 more revenues after 6 months since they can simply reconnect existing server capacity as standard sims .
( They would even be up in the first quarter already )
Even more dramatically , if we believe that Linden Lab can actually connect 500 standard sims per month ( which they did historically ) , they would still make more than US $ 600,000 additional revenues in the first 6 months after the introduction of the new pricing policy , even if people would suddenly simply abandon 90 % of all OS sims .
( Again , they would be up in the first quarter , too )
So where does these leave OS estate owners ?
Firstly , although the real world mechanics will be more complex than the simple scenario above , the simple message is clear :
Whatever you as an OS estate owner decide to do , in the end Linden Lab will not be bothered too much financially if virtually all OS sims would be abandoned by their owners .
Secondly , the price increase will very likely break a number of OS business models of profit - oriented estate owners .
As a result , Linden Lab will probably end up with a more consolidated , better capitalized and more professional customer base as OS estate owners may decide to leave the market by either abandoning or selling to larger estate holders with sufficient time and capital .
In addition , the Linden Lab will operate higher margin products ( standard sims ) and can probably save customer service costs on top of it ( It ’s cheaper to deal with 20 people owning 500 sims each than dealing with 500 people owning 20 sims each … ) .
This is not a bad position at all for Linden Lab to be in when entering into an RL economic recession .
What should infuriated OS estate owners do ?
On your business :
Sit down and do the math to see what prices you need to charge the people that are on your land to make your efforts worthwhile .
Communicate these prices to those people and see over the next few weeks if they can do this .
Also see if they would be willing to transfer to a standard sim if you could convert your OS sims .
If you come to the conclusion that it does n’t work for you anymore , find out if there is anybody out there that is willing to take over your sims .
And it nothing helps it might well be the best business decision to cut your losses and give up .
This is what you probably want to do with Linden Lab :
Well , accusing Linden Lab in the Second Life forums or blog of doing something “ illegal ” or “ breaking the contract ” or asking to “ give me back my money ” is simply retarded and childish .
Also , as shown above , threats to abandon OS sims are a waste of time as this will simply have no lasting impact on Linden Lab ’s revenues and profits .
Instead , try to focus on what could actually work for both Linden Lab and you , keeping in mind that Linden Lab really believes that they are not make enough money from OS sims .
The best way to do this is probably not staging in - world cartoon protests or messing around with SL groups .
Rather , people that hold a larger number of OS sims should connect in RL to represent a few thousand OS sims , agree on 2 - 3 clearly defined realistic points that they want Linden Lab do to keep them as customers , and communicate those points to Linden Lab directly in RL .
On such point could be free conversion of 4 OS sims into a standard sim .
If you have only 2 or 3 OS sims , suggest that you can acquire the “ missing ” sims you might need to convert for a discount .
I ’m sure that you have some ideas .
After all , even an upset customer is still a customer , whereas a new customer is a customer that is not yet there .

In an effort to remind people that it had a horse in the identity management race , MySpace last night announced MySpace ID – essentially a rename of the MySpace Data Availability project launched earlier this year to allow users to login with their MySpace credentials and import data on third - party sites .
The news comes on the heels of last week ’s near - simultaneous launches of Facebook Connect and Google Friend Connect , two similar products from MySpace competitors ( though the latter , it turns out , is more of an ally )
While much has been written about the technical differentiators between these services – MySpace embracing an “ open ” approach including plans to integrate with Google Friend Connect versus Facebook ’s “ walled garden ” – another piece of the puzzle is clearly starting to emerge : a battle for the different demographics of the Web .
As we recently noted in analyzing the growth of Facebook and stagnation of MySpace , it ’s not so much that MySpace is losing users in droves as it is that Facebook might be gaining completely new ones – users that previously did n’t belong to any social network .
Looking at the partners that each social network has signed on thus far , much of the split is along the demographic lines you ’d expect : Facebook partners include brands targeting more tech savvy and affluent demographics : CBS , CNET , Digg , and Hulu , to name a few , while MySpace touts more mainstream partners such as AOL , Yahoo , and eBay .
Think about it from a site owner ’s perspective : offering your users a way to login without creating an account is probably going to help increase registrations , but not if your users do n’t use the identity provider you ’re in bed with .
And from the perspective of the “ big three , ” the high profile partners they work with will dictate where the last mile of their users come from .
For example , I ’d venture to guess a CBS.com visitor is more likely to join Facebook , while an eBay user is more likely to join MySpace .
Meanwhile , Google Friend Connect sits somewhere in the middle of all this , offering users multiple sign - in options , though not returning the same benefits of Facebook and MySpace : publishing data back to social networks .
That approach would work great and be the clear winner – if Facebook agreed to be a part of it .
That probably wo n’t happen anytime soon , so until then , look for implementations that play to the demographics of individual websites and their respective identity provider .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp and Ford Motor
Co reported far deeper - than - expected quarterly losses on Friday and said their rate of cash burn had accelerated , as an extended slump in car sales raised questions about the future of the U.S. auto industry .
U.S. flags flutter in the wind in front of the General Motors Corp headquarters in Detroit , Michigan November 7 , 2008 .
General Motors Corp posted a worse - than - expected $ 4.2 billion operating loss and burned through $ 6.9 billion in cash in the third quarter as the top U.S. automaker struggled with a deepening sales slump that has forced it to seek a federal bailout .
REUTERS / Rebecca Cook ( UNITED STATES )
Both companies said they would take aggressive steps to cut their costs even further .
The two largest U.S. automakers reported third - quarter results after the world ’s No. 1 automaker , Toyota Motor Corp of Japan , slashed its profit forecast for the year .
GM ’s shares tumbled 13 percent and Ford ’s 2.5 percent .
The two collectively burned through $ 14.6 billion in cash in the quarter as they ran up bills related to restructuring actions and as they face a deepening global financial crisis .
Chrysler LLC is also burning through cash quickly , sources said .
GM also indicated it had set aside consideration of an acquisition of smaller rival Chrysler -- without mentioning the company ’s name -- saying it was focused on cost - cutting and other steps to free up $ 20 billion in liquidity through 2009 .
“ It offered significant synergies we felt , but the fact is those synergies tended to come in the medium and long term , ” GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said in an interview with CNBC business television .
“ The issue in short - term liquidity is the state of the auto industry and so we said we ’re going to put all our efforts on focusing on that issue for now . ”
Chrysler declined to confirm having talked with GM .
The news came the day after the heads of Ford , Chrysler and GM -- once called the Big Three , due to their dominance of the industry -- as well as the head of the United Auto Workers union went to the U.S. Congress seeking $ 50 billion in federal aid to help them ride out the crisis .
“ Today ’s deeper - than - expected quarterly loss at GM accelerates the need for government help for the sector , ” said Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group , of Greenwich , Connecticut .
HEFTY LOSSES , BURNING CASH
GM , the largest U.S. automaker , reported a $ 4.2 billion quarterly loss and said it would cut white - collar jobs and slash next year ’s capital spending budget by $ 2.5 billion to try to cope with a sharp sales slowdown .
Ford posted a $ 2.98 billion quarterly operating loss on Friday and told investors that it would look to cut salary expenses by 10 percent , a move that follows a 15 percent cut earlier this year .
Demand for cars is collapsing around the world , as fears of possibly deep recessions in the United States and Europe prompt consumers to put off big - ticket purchases and a worldwide credit crunch makes it harder for those who are interested in buying cars to get loans .
Ford said it depleted its cash by $ 7.7 billion -- almost 30 percent -- as it had to pay costs related to production cuts and make payments to Ford Credit in an effort to spur consumers to buy automobiles .
GM said it went through $ 6.9 billion in cash .
“ That cash burn was quite a bit higher than what would be a normal cash burn , ” said Ford CEO Alan Mulally in an interview on CNBC , explaining that Ford ratcheted down production of its best - selling F150 pickup in the quarter to prepare for the launch of a new 2009 model .
“ We ’re managing our cash very carefully , ” Mulally said , adding that he expects the rate of cash use to decline in the fourth quarter .
GM ’s Wagoner also said his company ’s cash burn would slow .
Privately owned Chrysler , which does not report financial information , is also rapidly spending its cash , according to people with knowledge of the situation .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Chrysler and its controlling shareholder , Cerberus Capital Management LP , declined comment .
“ As an independent company , we will continue to explore multiple strategic alliances or partnerships ... that would aid in our return to profitability , ” said Chrysler Chairman and CEO Bob Nardelli , in a statement .
Ford shares fell 5 cents , or 2.5 percent , to $ 1.93 .
They had been up prior to GM ’s news .
GM shares fell 64 cents to $ 4.16 .
Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange .
Both companies ’ shares have tumbled dramatically this year , with Ford down 71 percent and GM down 83 percent , far deeper slides than the 43 percent fall of the global Dow Jones Automobiles & Parts Titans 30 index .
SALES STALL WORLDWIDE
In Germany both Bayerische Motoren Werke AG or BMW , the world ’s largest premium carmaker , and its rival Daimler AG , maker of Mercedes , posted sharp sales declines in October , citing weakness in the United States and western Europe .
Both BMW and Daimler have reduced profit forecasts for their automobile businesses in two consecutive quarters following a sharp drop in demand .
Porsche SE posted a 46 percent rise in pretax profit for the 12 months ended in July that easily topped analysts ’ forecasts .
The growth was largely the result of better - than - expected returns from hedging strategies on shares of Volkswagen AG .
Analysts said Toyota ’s policy of breakneck expansion has left it especially exposed to an industry crunch brought on by the global financial crisis .

UUID ( Universal Unique Identifier ) notation is another way provided by Linux to access your disks .
Unlike the standardnotation , it is linked specifically to a particular piece of hardware ( whereasnotation can shift between disks depending on how they 're plugged in ) .
This means you do n't have the risk of a system reconfiguration causing disks to be renamed , and thus causing knock - on breakage of things that reference that disk .
UUID notation is one way to access your disks when using Linux .
But first you must find the identifier .
OK , so , first , how do you find out the UUID of your disk ?
The command blkid can be used  here 's its output for one of my disks :
# blkid / dev/hda1 / dev/hda1 : UUID = " 0ef96300-36c0-4575-8a1d-2d36ff4cd585 " SEC_TYPE = " ext2 " TYPE = " ext3 "
/ dev/disk / by_uuid/
df
Alternatively , you can look at thedirectory to see which UUID is associated with which disk .
( Useto find out what device names you currently have mounted . )
You can also do this the other way around , starting from the UUID : findfs UUID=uuid will tell you which disk is associated with that UUID .
Once you have the UUID of a device , you can use it with mount by using the - U switch :
mount - U 0ef96300-36c0-4575-8a1d-2d36ff4cd585 /mnt/disk1
/etc/fstab
UUID=uuid
/ dev/hdaX
or , you can use it in yourby puttingat the start of the relevant line , instead of
To assign a UUID to a disk , use tunefs .
You can generate your own UUID with the command uuidgen .
Then type :
tune2fs - U uuid /dev/sda2
dd
This might come in handy if , say , you 've cloned your disk ( e.g. , by using ) and must be able to mount both the original and the clone .
Assign it a new UUID and you 're away !

The distinctive sensation of tannins on the tongue will be familiar ( overfamiliar , perhaps ? ) to many arXivblog readers .
And if you ’ve ever wondered what causes that mouth - puckering dryness , you now have an answer thanks to the dedicated and selfless work of Drazen Zanchi and colleagues at the Laboratoire de Physique Théorique et Hautes Energies in Paris .
Tannins are large molecules with aromatic rings and OH groups which naturally bind to each other and to proteins , while repelling water .
So the presence of tannins causes proteins to aggregate together .
From the biological point of view , that makes good sense .
Tannins are part of plants ’ defence systems against the proteins that bacteria , viruses and higher herbivores secrete when invading .
It takes these proteins out of action be forcing them to aggrgegate together .
Zanchi says exactly this process is responsible for the mouthfeel of tannins .
Tannins bind to salivary proteins in the mouth making them aggregate and this causes a rapid and immediate drop in the viscosity of saliva .

Microtargeting uses computers and mathematical models to take disparate bits of information about voters  the cars they own , the groups they belong to , the magazines they read  and analyze it in a way to predict how likely a person is to vote and what issues and values are most important to him .
Often these analyses turn up surprising results ; for instance , Democrats have taken advantage of the fact that many evangelical Christians are open to hearing a pro-environmental message .
The technique first came on the political scene in 2000 when Mr. Gage convinced Karl Rove , the Bush campaign ’s chief strategist , that microtargeting , which was widely used by marketing companies in the business world , could be applied to politics and would to lead to a Bush victory .
That victory helped spur the development of the Republican Party ’s celebrated Voter Vault , which candidates can dip into to track down likely supporters and avoid wasting time on voters who can not be persuaded .
For years , Republicans had the landscape to themselves .
More recently , however , Democrats , along with such allies as trade unions and progressive groups , have poured millions of dollars into building two formidable databanks .
One is managed by the Democratic National Committee and can be used by candidates up and down the ballot .
The other is Catalist , a for - profit company headed by Harold M. Ickes , a Democratic political operative , that specializes in providing data for scores of liberal groups supporting the Democratic ticket as well as for the Obama campaign itself .
“ Candidates and organizations like the Sierra Club and the A.F.L. - C.I.O. now have the time and money to start focusing beyond basic microtargeting and to understanding more advanced voter behavior , ” said Vijay Ravindran , chief technology officer at Catalist , based in Washington .
“ There is a breadth and depth that we did not have before .
We were just trying to crawl .
There has been a concerted , deep and well - financed effort to catch up with and surpass what has been done on the other side . ”
Microtargeting has become so widespread that it is now used by all House and Senate candidates , on both sides , in state legislative races and , in some cases , all the way down the ballot to local school board elections .
Training on a budget is becoming very popular for shooters who want to shoot but do not want to spend …

Buy shares of good businesses that generate real profits , attractive returns on equity , have low to moderate debt to equity ratios , improving gross profit margins , a shareholder - friendly management , and at least some franchise value .
Everyone is thinking this is a terrible time to be invested .
But when everyone is thinking the same thing , no one is thinking much at all .
That means …. OPPORTUNITY .
If you have been wanting to change your financial future for the better , then now is the perfect time .
The invetory of cash producing , equity filled homes is at an all time high !
Did you know that most retirees single most lucrative investment during their working years was the home that they lived in .
Imagine if they had bought just one or two more properties ( that supported themselves of course ) and then retired .
Those are the moments when fortunes are made .
You might not recognize it at the time .
You might not know it for years .
But it ’s true .
When everyone is down on a stock , or a sector , or a country , you might as well take a look .
Usually , the negativity comes with good reason .
But the over - negativity can provide plenty of opportunity .
It ’s been that way forever , and it will always be so .

We do n’t always get them right , and you wo n’t always get them right when you invest .
No one does .

The thing is , the stock market is mostly rational .
Stuff ’s hated for a reason .
But as we have seen time and time again , market sentiment goes too far in one direction or the other .
I believe that there are plenty of places where the market has overreacted .
They were excited , and now they ’re not .
And that makes me excited .
My personal favourite is the Warren Buffet ’s Berkshire Hathaway Model .
In essence , you live off your day job , funding your retirement out of your regular salary .
Then , you build other cash generators ( e.g. , car washes , retail stores , newspaper routes , a lifeguard job during the summer , patents , royalties , rental houses , etc. ) that you use to build your investment portfolio .
That way , while you are doing your regular thing – going to work , picking up the kids , having staff meetings , and putting gas in the car – your cash generators are pouring money into your brokerage , retirement , and other investment accounts .
This can shave decades off your quest to financial independence , not to mention protect you if you happened to lose your job ( in which case , you could temporarily pull the money out of the cash generators to pay your living expenses until you could find work again ) .
All of this was built out of a paper route that provided Warren ’s initial capital more than sixty years ago .

The Only Thing Videogames Have n't Stolen from Aliens
When it comes to videogames , Aliens is the most influential movie of all time .
From 1990 's Xenomorph to this year 's Gears of War 2 , with all of Halo in between and Sega 's Aliens : Colonial Marines yet to come , this decades - old film has lent its claustrophobic terror , punctuated suspense and seductive action to dozens of games .
More than any other element , however , Aliens ' depiction of futuristic marines - foul - mouthed , attractively armored and wielding chunky assault rifles - has endured , defining the sci - fi fighting man for a generation .
The space marine is a cliché , but , like all clichés , it has a worthy origin : Aliens is one of the greatest movies ever made .
The irony is that the most innovative aspect of Aliens is the film 's hero : a fighting mom , rather than a fighting man .
Sigourney Weaver stars as Ellen Ripley in all of the Alien films , and nowhere does her sex have more importance than in Aliens .
At a fundamental level , Aliens is about motherhood and the superior strength of mothers over that of male warriors .
" Nuke the entire site from orbit " - that 's her line .
It 's Ripley who straps and tapes together a flamethrower and an M - 41A Pulse Rifle ( with over / under 40 mm grenade launchers ! ) , creating the most super - badass jury - rigged weapon of all time .
It 's Ripley who kills the Alien queen .
She saves a marine and a little girl .
Yet games have never explored the archetype of the Fighting Mom in the way that they have the Parasitic Alien or the Space Marine .
What gives ?
How About the Boys ?
The influence of the Alien films on games is immense and precedes the release of Aliens in 1986 .
Ridley Scott 's Alien , released in 1979 , has profoundly affected the aesthetic of the digital beasties we 've happily gunned down and the environments in which we 've hunted them .
Ancient titles , such as Contra and Metroid , took style cues from the biomechanical designs Swiss artist H.R. Giger produced for Alien , as did the recently released Dead Space .
The idea of a creature that fatally parasitizes its human hosts and integrates its hive with starships seems both natural and horrifying .
Games were smart to steal it .
But as much as videogames have profited from Giger 's art , they have made a killing from Aliens director James Cameron 's depiction of space marines .
Cameron wanted a Vietnam feel for his sequel to Alien .
He wanted to show advanced weaponry and training failing against a low - tech enemy , and he also wanted to depict the military defending corporate interests .
Thus , the mightily equipped Colonial Marines ship out to planet LV - 426 to advance the interests of the Weyland - Yutani corporation .
These soldiers have dominated the imaginations of game developers ever since .
Merkel 's Push for Consensus Crisis Creates a New German Politics
The effects of the worldwide economic crisis are leading to a new globalization in politics .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking unity in Europe to deal with the financial crisis , while at home consensus and cooperation are the new watchwords .
Is it the beginning of a new politics ?
The banks got their bailout , will the automakers be next ?
I 'm sadly inclined to say probably , despite the first bailout 's focus on presidential politicking .
The forthcoming bailout will likely follow the same path .
But it does n't have to be like that ; the auto industry can be saved without writing a blank check .
The greatest obstacle to any bailout revolves around the concern of limited monetary resources ; is any one entity more worthy than the next ?
In the case of the big three , a valid argument could probably be made to support the bailout of each company , but a definitive answer does not exist .
So what comes next ?
Two questions must be asked of the situation ; ( A ) Is the company worth saving ?
( B ) Can the company use the money to survive , while providing a service or product that enables all involved to thrive ?
In the case of the auto bailout , A is essentially unarguable as people need cars , but B presents a dilemma .
Is a stagnant , but functional auto industry better than no auto industry at all ?
Capital
Hill seems to be struggling with an answer , but it does n't have to be like that ; the auto industry could be made better .
The American Auto Industry has demonstrated a complete inability to compete with the likes of Honda and Toyota over the past decade .
Why should the American Taxpayer be required to prop up these failing entities with years of historical incompetence ?
The truth is , Americans need cars , and at the moment there are only three American options .
In the future a fourth company may arise , but in the interim , at least two of these companies must exist ; for both diversity of product and antitrust laws .
If two of these companies must survive , does n't it make sense to choose the two companies best situated for future growth and expansion ?
Here 's the plan : a massive auto industry throwdown with the winners splitting the currently proposed $ 25 Billion bailout .
Each company sends a representative to a congressional oversight panel and the rules are decided in committee .
The competition is open to any company , any entity , any single person meeting predetermined qualifications and will last 6 months .
If at the end of 6 months , the designated objectives are not met , the $ 25 Billion is not allocated and the companies must survive on their own , or fold .
If just one company meets the objectives , the next closest company must also receive funding .
All of these contingencies , and others , must be established in advance , by the aforementioned committee .
If the participants want to compete , they must be held accountable by providing non-subsidized financing .
Banks accepting money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) would be required to provide a loan to any interested participant using reasonable lending discretion .
Each bank would also be forgiven of the 5 % interest rate associated with their participation in TARP , upto the amount loaned to automotive throwdown participants .
Essentially all funding for the throwdown would be provided by TARP through participating banks .
The Treasury Secretary could then insure these automotive loans , thus removing liability from the banks themselves .
Under these circumstances , the banks benefit by collecting interest and the government is not required to spend additional money ( assuming the banks are responsible lenders ) for at least another 6 months .
This scenario presents essentially two possible outcomes ; either ( 1 ) All participants collapse , or ( 2 ) at least two participants succeed and the automotive industry gets , what is hopefully a jump start into economic and technological prosperity .
In both scenarios , it is assumed that the banks made reasonable lending decisions , and are consequently unaffected by either outcome .
The first scenario presents possible ramifications ; I 'll start with job loss .
Should the jobs created by the autos factor into the bailout decision ?
There seems to be a growing movement , John McCain included , who foolishly believe once manufacturing jobs are lost , they are gone forever .
The manufacturing sector will never disappear so long as there are items to be made .
Anybody working , with the right support can be retrained to make another item , so long as there are other items to be made .
So how could the government ensure job availability to these workers in the event of an American automotive collapse ?
I suggest a public works project .
Anybody unemployed can go work for the federal government , in their home state building windmills or solar panels under a newly created National Alternative Energy Agency ( NAEA ) .
Using the World War II model , a massive industrial complex could be created that generates new jobs and reduces America 's strain on foreign fuels .
If the government is willing to float a $ 700 Billion check to the banking industry why would n't it spend $ 647,521,359,420 ( PDF ) to alleviate America 's need for fossil fuel generated electricity .
Was n't the down fall of the auto industry higher gas prices ?
Does n't it seem absurd to blindly support a failing industry without addressing the central cause of its failure ?
Yet it seems all too likely that such a thing will happen .
The auto industry has survived on minor revisions for the better part of a decade , but America does n't need a recolored cozy - coupe , we need a green cozy - coupe .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Passions flared in a Maine town on Thursday over a sign in a store asking customers to place bets on an assassination of President - elect Barack Obama .
The Town Council in Standish condemned the sign on Thursday in a 6 - 0 vote and declared it reprehensible at a meeting where some residents defended the store owner , saying he had a right to free speech even if in bad taste , local authorities said .
“ The town of Standish condemns in the strongest terms any such alleged activity calling for violence against any individual no matter their position , race or ethnicity , ” said the resolution posted on the town ’s website .
The sign in the Oak Hill General Store asked customers to place a $ 1 bet on the date of Obama ’s assassination , and said “ Let ’s hope someone wins , ” the Portland Press Herald reported .
It was called the “ Osama Obama Shotgun Pool . ”
The store in the town of 9,285 people in southwest Maine has remained closed since reports of the sign appeared in the media on Sunday .
About 80 people attended the meeting , including some who defended the store owner , said town clerk Mary Chapman .
“ There were folks on both sides of the issue , ” Chapman said in a telephone interview .
“ People were passionate of their opinion but very respectful of others . ”
Obama ’s historic election victory as the nation ’s first black president has sparked racist incidents nationwide , according to groups that monitor hate crimes .
Obama , an Illinois senator , won the November 4 presidential contest in Maine over Republic Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Public outrage over executive pay has reached the tipping point , Richard Ferlauto says of the recent bailout .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Activist ’s crusade : Curbing CEO pay
Richard Ferlauto has spent the past 11 years in Washington working toward just one goal : curbing what he sees as outrageously high CEO pay in corporate America .
As the director of corporate governance and pension policy at the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , Ferlauto has led the charge on behalf of unions in Congress after Congress , with very little success to show for it .
Advertisement
But in the wake of the executive pay provisions in the $ 700 billion financial bailout , Ferlauto believes the political ground has shifted dramatically , and he ’s readying an effort to extract even greater concessions from corporate executives next year .
“ This is the tipping point , ” Ferlauto said .
“ Voters are seeking retribution from the corporate elites who put them in this position . ”
The $ 250 billion plan to inject liquidity directly into the banking system contained some fairly dramatic curbs on corporate pay that affect the compensation of chief executive officers , chief financial officers and a firm ’s next three highest - paid executives .
The financial institutions that accept government money will have to make sure that their incentive plans do n’t encourage executives to take unnecessary risk — a factor that some have argued contributed to the financial crisis in the first place — and will be prohibited from making so - called golden parachute payments to top brass .
What ’s more , the government has the right to “ claw back ” any pay that is granted to an executive based on financial results that are later found to be inaccurate .
Additionally , companies are n’t allowed to take tax deductions on executive compensation above $ 500,000 for each senior executive .
Executives across the country are finding themselves under increasing scrutiny .
AIG officials , for example , found themselves pilloried in early October for spending more than $ 400,000 to send employees to a retreat at a luxury resort in California just a few days after the Federal Reserve committed $ 85 billion to keep the insurance giant out of bankruptcy .
All that means the challenge for business next year may be staving off a slew of new anti-corporate - pay initiatives from Ferlauto and his allies .
And the effort to cap executive pay may not end with the financial services industry .
“ Everybody ’s going to have to pay attention to it in this environment , ” said one Fortune 500 company lobbyist who plans to fight almost anything Ferlauto ’s side proposes .
“ Anybody who is not watching the signals that are coming from Congress is just naive . ”
What Ferlauto would like to see goes beyond limits for pay at companies that accept taxpayer handouts .
He ’d also like to see investors empowered with so - called say - on - pay rules that would put executive compensation to a shareholder vote .
He also wants to push for shareholders to have more ability to put independent members on corporate boards of directors and for limits on corporate ability to pay deferred compensation that ’s awarded not as salary , but only after the executive retires .
“ Industry has been complacent , ” Ferlauto said .
“ They have n’t understood the widespread discontent and feeling that there was inequity that was un-American in the way that profits were distributed . ”
Industry , though , plans to fight any effort that would limit the free market ’s ability to determine executive pay .
Bruce Josten , a lobbyist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , argues that Congress was wrong to impose any executive pay restrictions at all .
“ If the Treasury is going to loan a bank $ 20 billion , do n’t we want the best possible person in that job ? ” he asked .
“ Or do we want the $ 35,000 - a - year candidate ?
If protecting the taxpayer is the goal , my answer is get the best person you can . ”
Still , Josten knows he ’s going to hear a lot more about executive compensation next year — particularly , he says , if Democrats control both the White House and Congress .
“ We will continue to hear populist rhetoric surrounding this issue , ” he said .
I have followed the work ( and warnings ) of Dr. Martin Weiss , PhD for years .
Some do not like the doom and gloom tone of his emails but if one pays attention , the man does his homework , his research and draws the correct conclusions well over 90 % of the time .
I even cited some of his research and prognoses in Chapter 4 of ' One - Way Ticket to Crawford Texas ' , because he was right then and now .
What he was predicting back in 2003 and 2004 was to what extent the US policies were setting the stage for a massive collapse of the US economy .
The key elements to break , crush and leave the US economy in shambles were being put into place all in the name of Free Trade , and globalization , but with no regards for job creation at home to keep the " consumer based economy " going .
Even while the foundation of the US economy was crumbling , all DC and the Federal Reserve could come up with was cheap money and let Americans keep shopping to keep the illusion alive .
Even the true CPI and inflation numbers were falsified in taking out the cost of energy and cost of food as being inflationary .
Even the false but rapidly increasing prices of new homes were not factored in for the most part .
Shop America , it is good for America !
The problem was they introduced the Global War on Terror , too , and that caused the dominoes to start falling , the house of cards to come crashing down .
Another problem was the fraud was running rampant and our gutless leaders did nothing about that .
Sending Andy Fastow ( ENRON ) and Bernie Ebbers ( WorldCom ) to prison did not even slow down the real predators .
These two men were just the fronts for much bigger predators and agendas behind the scenes .
When rule of law means nothing , well , it means nothing .
Too many Americans read the headline and not the facts .
Those Enron assets did not just disappear .
They were parked offshore , outside of the jurisdiction of the US Bankruptcy Court and a group of people walked off with tens of billions in assets that were paid for by the equity shareholders of that company .
They got $ 0 in the bankruptcy and a group of predators walked off with tens of billions of offshore Enron assets .
Well , uh , it has happened folks .
The largest financial crash in history has happened due to the policies Bush and Congress pursued all in the name of US hegemony and trying to push the world back to a unipolar world dominated solely by the United States .
That Unipolar World died when China was granted WTO status and the USSR disbanded and began rebuilding into an energy powerhouse .
The world changed for the better and the pea-brained dinosaurs in Washington , DC kept pushing a bad hand .
It was not just Bush ; it was also these lying charlatans on the DNC side of the aisle too .
They are all equally corrupt , and sadly , equally stupid , equally negligent .
They have , literally , killed the American Dream .
It will take many years for the US economy to heal and even after that .... things will not , cannot , be the same .
There is a big difference between ' doom and gloom ' when it is the unvarnished truth that people need to read and heed , and all you are hearing on MSM are an endless stream of DC and Wall Street lies to keep you from knowing the truth .
Think back over the past 3 years of how many times the Federal Reserve , Bush , Congress , the talking heads on each major network , have all assured that the then current economic glitches were just that ..... glitches .
In a recent article , Dr. Weiss published his findings for how bad the losses were just in the third quarter of 2008 .... in US households .
Right at home where you and the rest of America lives and the losses are huge , staggering , economic devastation .
Remember well that is when Bush finally started mumbling that the ' US economy is having some problems but overall the US economy is strong ' .
Remember that ?
Strong ?
Compared to what ?
A corpse ?
A bed - ridden patient in a coma ?
Glitches ?
I say that over $ 8 trillion in bailout is a tad more than a glitch .
More like a black hole , total financial ruin , etc .
I have watched this calamity building since 1994 and have come to the conclusion that George Bush cannot predict when he is going to foul his next diaper .
I am not sure what his MBA is about , but economics and financial brilliance is not in that deck of cards .
Well , the coroner 's report is now in and folks , it is even uglier than most can imagine .
http://www.moneyandmarkets.com/deflation-strikes-hard-what-to-do-2-28734
" Just in the third quarter alone , U.S. households lost $ 647 billion in real estate ; $ 922 billion in stocks ; $ 523 billion in mutual funds ; $ 653 billion in life insurance and pension fund reserves ; plus $ 128 billion in private business interests . "
" Total destruction of household wealth in the third quarter : $ 2.8 trillion , the worst in recorded history .
That 's four times more than the government 's entire $ 700 billion bailout package ( TARP ) . "
Actually , Dr. Weiss left out two major things that are foreign in nature .
The Federal Reserve has apparently paid out about $ 2 trillion to foreign banks and governments ( undisclosed sources who received that money ) to keep the US government , Federal Reserve and Wall Street from being sued for fraud and making this all a matter of public record .
Also , the true costs of propping up this American Empire that are offshore related , black ops related , off - the - books dirty money related , make those Domestic Losses even worse than they are .
Next in the wave of foreclosures will be commercial office buildings , strip shopping centers , regional shopping malls , and many more homes .
The carnage will continue through 2009 and probably through 2010 , 2011 and into the next major election cycle .
If you are feeling poorer today , sadly , you are .
Deflation is now gutting the wealth of Americans down at the home level , and the more the Federal Reserve prints money to bail out the thieves and banksters , the worse the deflation will become .
This has happened before , as recently as the Carter Administration .
The backside of that was US prime rates shot to 21 % because the US government could not find investors for more US debt at low interest rates .
In the early 1980s , there was a ' glitch ' called the inverted yield curve where 10 year money was more costly than 30 year money , but there were no 30 year mortgages to be found .
The only silver lining I see in these storm clouds is that this catastrophe might be the catalyst that wakes Americans up to the reality that the entire Band of Thieves in Washington , DC have to go .
Whether by force or by vote , or by indictment , they have to go .
America cannot suffer their pathetic leadership any longer .
Karl
I 'm going to come right out and say it .
I HATE our bathroom with a fiery passion .
After living with it for a year - and - a- bit I decided that something had to be done .
Now my first choice would have been to rip it out , burn the pieces and salt the earth , cursing all the while .
Trouble is this is a rental , and the agency might have a problem with that .
Here 's the before and after shots :
Note the ill advised blue paint on the 70's medicine cabinet doors and the 40 million miles of impossible - to - clean floor grout .
Here 's what I used :
A few self adhesive vinyl floor tiles .
( $ 8 worth from the Dollarama )
a new shower curtain .
8 Placemats and some glue to make new slidey doors for the cabinets .
( 2 for a $ from the Dollarama )
First I did the floor , using instructions that I found here .
I cleaned the tiles with bleach then vinegar , cause of the whole sticky Vs. Dirt thing .
Then I popped the new tiles straight over top of the old ones .
It 's probably easier if you do n't get a small dog to help you .
Next came the cabinets , after experimenting with some contact paper I decided to write off the old doors and start from scratch .
I made new doors from Bamboo placemats glued onto stiffer plastic placemats .
Using the old door as a template I chopped the placemats to size glued them together .
Then I jammed the whole ' door ' into the slot that the old door came out of .
These are light enough that they do n't need doorknobs .
Lastly I bunged a plant in there and folded some towels .
It 's not perfect , but I no longer feel the need to sack it like Carthage .
And , like my kitchen , it can still be returned to it 's former hideous state should the need arise .
A new study highlights the role of a charge - switching enzyme in nervous system deficits characteristic of multiple sclerosis and other related neurological illness .
Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is one of several diseases in which myelin – the insulator for electrical signaling in the nervous system – breaks down and causes severe deficits in brain and nerve function .
Much like the rubber insulation on an electrical cord , myelin surrounds long projections from the body of a neuron , and allows signals to travel down the cell with speed and efficiency .
Patients with MS and other " de- myelinating " diseases therefore suffer deficits in balance , coordination , and movement , as well as sensory disturbances , from the loss of this neuronal insulation .
A major research initiative in treating these diseases is identifying the molecular factors and changes that lead to myelin breakdown .
In a new study published in Disease Models & Mechanisms ( DMM ) , dmm.biologists.org , a team of Canadian researchers report on a new mouse model of disease which will help in understanding how demyelination occurs .
Previous research had identified that an enzyme known as peptidylarginine deiminase 2 , or PAD2 , is increased in patients with MS , and that PAD2 switches a charge on a protein key to myelin stability .
Therefore , Abdiwahab A. Musse and colleagues at the University of Guelph and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario created a genetically modified mouse expressing too much of an enzyme known as PAD2 .
They found that these mice had significant loss of myelin , and also have behavioral deficits , such as abnormal movement , balance , and coordination .
Not only does this work present a new mouse model to study demyleinating disease , but it also stresses the importance of PAD in maintaining myelin integrity .
Their work highlights PAD as a potential therapeutic target , as well as a potential marker for early detection of MS and other diseases characterized by a loss of myelin .
The report was written by Abdiwahab A. Musse , Dorothee Bienzle , Roberto Poma , and George Harauz at the University of Guelph in Guelph , Ontario , and Zhen Li , Cameron A. Ackerley , Helena Lei , Mario A. Moscarello and Fabrizio G. Mastronardi at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto , Ontario .
The report is published in the November / December issue of a new research journal , Disease Models & Mechanisms ( DMM ) , published by The Company of Biologists , a non-profit based in Cambridge , UK .
House hears from former militants on reconciliation
With all the talk of pallin ' around with terrorists lately , political - image conscious Crypt readers might want to avoid 2172 Rayburn right now , considering the characters with less - than - peaceful pasts briefing the House Subcommittee on International Organizations , Human Rights , and Oversight .
The briefiing brings together militants who were once on the opposite sides of brutal conflicts in South African and Northern Ireland .
The former enemies are working with Iraqis now going through the same process .
One of those helping the Iraqis is Mac Maharaj who , like former Weatherman William Ayers , is now a professor .
Earlier in his career , however , he was Nelson Mandela 's cellblock - mate during a 12 year prison stay , locked up by South Africa 's apartheid regime for leading the African National Congress ' underground military operations and waging a bombing campaign against the government .
Cyril Ramaphosa also spent time in prison , convicted under South Africa 's Terrorism Act , before being elected secretary general of the ANC in 1991 .
He was the ANC 's lead negotiator during peace talks .
There 's Roelf Meyer , who fought against Maharaj as Minister of Defense for the apartheid regime .
Meyer then led negotiations for his side during the transition from apartheid to democracy and is speaking today beside his former enemy .
Due to a death in the family , the abover erstwhile combatants are not joined by Martin McGuinness , who served time for terrorist activity on behalf of the Irish Republican Army .
McGuinness , a top militant , later became a lead negotiator in peace talks .
Continuing with the theme of former enemies , protestant Jeffrey Donaldson is on hand .
Donaldson , a lead negotiator of the Good Friday Accord , rejected the agreement as too leniant on the IRA , but has since reconciled .
The militants have not been gathered together to make a point about Ayers and domestic terrorism associations , but have been brought in by chairman William Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) to discuss their role in the Helsinki Agreement .
Professor Padraig O'Malley , also on hand today , brought 40 leaders of Iraqi factions to Helsinki earlier this year to meet with the South Africans and Irish combatants that are here today .
If South Africa and the United Kingdom can reconcile , so went his thinking , then so too can the Iraqis .
Many of the Iraqi leaders represented factions that have engaged in terrorist bombings against Iraqi civilians and U.S. soldiers .
The Iraqis hammered out a broad framework that all signed , though its vague terms mean that much progress remains to be made .
Professors routinely give advice to students but usually while their charges are still in school .
Arthur Landy , a distinguished professor of molecular and cell biology and biochemistry at Brown University , recently decided , however , that he had to remind a former premed student of his that “ without evolution , modern biology , including medicine and biotechnology , would n’t make sense . ”
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - A group of Iranian hard - line clerics is signing up volunteers to fight in the Gaza Strip in response to Israel ’s air strikes that have killed at least 300 Palestinians , a news agency reported on Monday .
“ From Monday the Combatant Clergy Society has activated its website www.rohaniatmobarez.com for a week to register volunteers to fight against the Zionist regime ( Israel ) in either the military , financial or propaganda fields , ” the semi-official Fars news agency said .
Israel patrols the coastal waters around Gaza and has declared areas around the enclave a “ closed military zone . ”
The hard - line Iranian group , which is headed by some leading clergy , says it has no affiliation with the government and was formed shortly after Iran ’s 1979 Islamic revolution .
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a religious decree to Muslims around the world on Sunday , ordering them to defend Palestinians in Gaza against Israeli attacks “ in any way possible . ”
A religious decree is an official statement by a high - ranking religious leader that commands Muslims to carry out its message .
While there is no religious and legal force behind it , Khamenei is respected by many Iranian and non-Iranian Shi’ites .
Iran refuses to recognize Israel , which accuses Tehran of supplying Hamas Islamists with weapons .
Iran denies the claim , saying it only provides moral support to the group .

Israel said the strikes , that have killed 307 Palestinians , were launched in response to almost daily rocket and mortar fire from the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip after the Islamist Hamas group ended a six - month ceasefire a week ago .
Fars said the hard - line group provided volunteers with a registration document called “ Registration form for dispatching volunteers to Gaza . ”
It said more than 1,100 people so far had registered for military service against Israel .
Khamenei said on Sunday that whoever was killed in the fight to defend Palestinians was “ considered a martyr . ”
Iran will send its first ship carrying aid to the Gaza Strip on Monday , Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said .
“ Iran has dispatched its first plane load of aid , including medicine , to Gaza on Sunday .
The second cargo is on the verge of being dispatched , ” Qashqavi told reporters on Monday .
“ The first aircraft arrived in Egypt last night . ”
Israel , which patrols the coastal waters around Gaza , tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip two years ago after Hamas won a parliamentary election .

The Jewish state turned back a Libyan ship from delivering humanitarian supplies to Gaza earlier this month .
Tens of thousands of Iranians protested on Monday to condemn the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip , which began with air strikes on Saturday .
Protesters burned Israeli and U.S. flags and demanded a stronger response from international organizations to stop Israel ’s raids , a Reuters witness said .
They also called on Islamic countries to boycott “ Zionist companies . ”

Court sides with ACLU , strikes down Patriot Act gag provision Stephen C. Webster

This ACLU victorious as federal court declares Patriot Act provision a violation of the First Amendment
A federal appeals court ruling late Monday is the cause célèbre of the American Civil Liberties Union , as another provision of the Bush administration 's Patriot Act falls to the judicial system .
Until the ruling , recipients of so - called " national security letters " were legally forbidden from speaking out .
The letters , usually a demand for documents , or a notice that private records had been searched by government authorities , were criticized as a cover - all for FBI abuses .
" The appeals court invalidated parts of the statute that wrongly placed the burden on NSL recipients to initiate judicial review of gag orders , holding that the government has the burden to go to court and justify silencing NSL recipients , " said the ACLU in a release .
" The appeals court also invalidated parts of the statute that narrowly limited judicial review of the gag orders  provisions that required the courts to treat the government 's claims about the need for secrecy as conclusive and required the courts to defer entirely to the executive branch . "
Because of the ruling , the government will now be forced to justify individual gag orders before a court , instead of casually wielding the power of a blanket gag as the Bush administration has done since the blindingly fast passage of the Patriot Act in Oct. 2001 .
In Sept. 2007 , a federal judge ruled unconstitutional provisions within the Patriot Act which allowed the government to obtain search warrants without probable cause .
The ACLU 's complete press release follows .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 15 , 2008
NEW YORK 
A federal appeals court today upheld , in part , a decision striking down provisions of the Patriot Act that prevent national security letter ( NSL ) recipients from speaking out about the secret records demands .
The decision comes in an American Civil Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union lawsuit challenging the FBI 's authority to use NSLs to demand sensitive and private customer records from Internet Service Providers and then forbid them from discussing the requests .
Siding with the ACLU , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the statute 's gag provisions violate the First Amendment .
" We are gratified that the appeals court found that the FBI cannot silence people with complete disregard for the First Amendment simply by saying the words ' national security , ' " said Melissa Goodman , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project .
" This is a major victory for the rule of law .
The court recognized the need for judicial oversight of the government 's dangerous gag power and rejected the Bush administration 's position that the courts should just rubber - stamp these gag orders .
By upholding the critical check of judicial review , the FBI can no longer use this incredible power to hide abuse of its intrusive Patriot Act surveillance powers and silence critics . "
The appeals court invalidated parts of the statute that wrongly placed the burden on NSL recipients to initiate judicial review of gag orders , holding that the government has the burden to go to court and justify silencing NSL recipients .
The appeals court also invalidated parts of the statute that narrowly limited judicial review of the gag orders  provisions that required the courts to treat the government 's claims about the need for secrecy as conclusive and required the courts to defer entirely to the executive branch .
" The appellate panel correctly observed that the imposition of such a conclusive presumption ignored well - settled First Amendment standards and deprived the judiciary of its important function as a protector of fundamental rights , " said Arthur Eisenberg , Legal Director for the New York Civil Liberties Union .
In this regard , the opinion stated : " The fiat of a governmental official , though senior in rank and doubtless honorable in the execution of official duties , cannot displace the judicial obligation to enforce constitutional requirements . "
The court , therefore , also ruled that the government must now justify the gag on the John Doe NSL recipient in the case , a gag that has been in place for more than four years .
The ACLU and New York Civil Liberties Union filed this lawsuit in April 2004 on behalf of an Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) that received an NSL .
Because the FBI imposed a gag order on the ISP , the lawsuit was filed under seal , and even today the ACLU is prohibited from disclosing its client 's identity .
The FBI continues to maintain the gag order even though the underlying investigation is more than four years old ( and may well have ended ) , and even though the FBI abandoned its demand for records from the ISP over a year and a half ago .
In September 2004 , Judge Victor Marrero of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York struck down the NSL statute , ruling that the FBI could not constitutionally demand sensitive records without judicial review and that permanent gag orders violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech .
The government appealed the ruling , but Congress amended the NSL provision before the court issued a decision .
The ACLU brought a new challenge to the amended provision , and in September 2007 , Judge Marrero again found the statute unconstitutional .
Bills aimed at bringing the NSL authority back in line with the Constitution were introduced last year in both the House and Senate after reports had confirmed and detailed the widespread abuse of the authority by federal law enforcement .
Since the Patriot Act was passed in 2001 , relaxing restrictions on the FBI 's use of the power , the number of NSLs issued has seen an astronomical increase , to nearly 200,000 between 2003 and 2006 .
A March 2008 Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) report revealed that , among other abuses , the FBI misused NSLs to sidestep the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) .
In one instance , the FBI issued NSLs to obtain information after the FISC twice refused its requests on First Amendment grounds .
The OIG also found that the FBI continues to impose gag orders on about 97 percent of NSL recipients and that , in some cases , the FBI failed to sufficiently justify why the gag orders were imposed in the first place .
In addition to this case , the ACLU has challenged this Patriot Act statute multiple times .
One case was brought on behalf of a group of Connecticut librarians and another case , called Internet Archive v. Mukasey , involved an NSL served on a digital library in California .
In the latter case , the FBI withdrew the NSL and the gag as part of the settlement of a legal challenge brought by the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Attorneys in Doe v. Mukasey are Jameel Jaffer , Goodman and L. Danielle Tully of the ACLU National Security Project and Eisenberg of the NYCLU .

DESIGN IN GENERAL
A new study finds that children who are breastfed are less likely to develop asthma , respiratory issues , or eczema .
“ Breastfed children showed lower prevalence rates of asthma , rhinitis and eczema , and the effect of breast feeding was more evident in boys than girls .
Asthma and wheeze were resolved significantly earlier in breastfed children than those who were not breastfed ” – Dr Mohammad Shamssain of the University of Sunderland .
[ social_buttons ]
The study , covering 7000 children ages 6 to 15 years old , found that babies who were breastfed for four to nine months had a significantly lower risk of developing asthma , with those nursing for seven to nine months had fewer instances of persistent coughing and wheezing .
The breastfed children were also less likely to have eczema .
“ Breast feeding is a cost effective approach to a significant prevention of allergic disease in children .
Our research demonstrates that exclusive breastfeeding prevents the development of allergic diseases in children , ” Dr Shamssain said .
The research also showed that obese children had higher rates of asthma and other respiratory symptoms , and that obese boys in particular were at much higher risk for life - time asthma .
They noted that obesity is a definite risk factor in asthma in young children .
The results of the study were presented at the European Respiratory Society in Berlin last month .

When President Bush hosts a world financial summit in the coming weeks , one of the least multilateral American presidents in decades will set in motion what could result in a full reordering of the global financial system .
The series of summits that Mr. Bush announced over the weekend at Camp David with European leaders at his side suggests a broad understanding among them : that the current crisis requires the kind of global regulatory reforms that have eluded major powers in the past .
Europeans especially are speaking of a " Bretton Woods II " that could do for financial markets what the 1944 summit at a resort in New Hampshire did for monetary policy .
But the call for a summit also underscores the degree to which a once go - it - alone presidency has shifted to embrace not only the necessity of international cooperation , but also a role of global leadership .
" Talk of a Bretton Woods II has been around to different degrees for 30 years .
But the fact it is getting started with an outgoing administration and especially one that was at the center of a significant crisis between America and Europe , between America and the rest of the world , suggests the recognition that there is urgency in the air , " says Simon Serfaty , an expert in US - Europe relations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) in Washington .
" It also adds legitimacy to the coming process . "
That process , which is expected to stretch into next year and a new American administration , will get under way with a summit that Bush will host sometime after Nov. 4 , the date of US elections , according to a statement issued Saturday by Bush , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , and European Union Commission President José Manuel Barroso .
The initial summit is expected to be a kind of expanded Group of Eight meeting , assembling the leaders of the most industrialized nations and those of major developing economies like China , India , Brazil , and South Korea .
It would aim to assess the current global crisis and to come up with a set of principles of reform .
Actual agreements on reforms could come at subsequent summits , but the initial meeting would allow Bush to place his stamp on the process before leaving office , while also facilitating a continuity of American leadership .
Saturday 's meeting offered a picture of transatlantic unity , but that hardly means the road ahead will be discord - free .
Bush says future reforms and new international regulations must improve but not fetter the free market , while European leaders hint at much more robust state intervention with tighter regulations .
Bush recognized the need for " regulatory institutional changes " but added , " It is essential that we preserve the foundations of democratic capitalism – commitment to free markets , free enterprise , and free trade . "
In response , President Sarkozy said , " The president of the United States is right in saying that protectionism and closing one 's borders is a catastrophe ....
But we cannot continue along the same lines , " he added , " because the same problems will trigger the same disasters . "
Mr. Barroso was more succinct : " We need a new global financial order . "
Those words could send shivers through a White House that is suspicious of the current chorus of world leaders – European , Russian , and others less friendly to the US – who are hailing the current economic crisis as a moment to usher in a multipolar world .
Bush indicated he seeks to maintain some degree of American stewardship over the financial reform effort when he politely declined the offer of United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki Moon to host the expanded G - 8 summit at the UN in New York .
Among the issues the White House has indicated it would endorse for a reform agenda are rules for the international flow of investment funds , improved oversight of increasingly global financial institutions , and means of boosting the transparency of international financial transactions and markets .
But European leaders have called for what sound like much deeper reforms .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , for example , has proposed a reorganization of the International Monetary Fund – a Bretton Woods institution .
Behind the European proposals is a sense that the financial crisis and America 's darkening economic prospects make this an opportunity for the European Union to play a bigger international role .
Last week at the close of a two - day EU summit on the financial crisis , Sarkozy predicted that an international summit would take place before the end of the year because " Europe wants it , Europe demands it .
Europe will get it . "
More than a show of unity with a declaration for a series of summits will be needed if the world is truly to come together to address the crisis , some observers note .
" Unity of purpose is not found in a meeting or series of meetings .
It 's found in purpose , " says Danielle Pletka , vice president for foreign - policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
" Whether that 's something the major players in this crisis can come together on remains to be seen . "
But Mr. Serfaty points out that the Europeans chose to engage the Bush administration , when just a few years ago the deep divisions over the Iraq war were disrupting such cooperation .
" Rather than seeing any kind of disconnect , " he says , " I think we should emphasize the fact the Europeans are doing what [ the Americans ] want them to do , in that they are coming together and taking a proactive approach to this crisis . "
This news should be especially interesting for anyone who loves sushi and happens to be an iPhone owner : Major Japanese publishing company Shogakukan is planning to release a virtual sushi guide for the iPhone ( J ) .
The sushi encyclopedia will be available for download on both the iPod Touch and the iPhone by the end of this month ( price in Apple ’s App Store : 450 yen / 5 USD / 3.50 Euros ) .
The guide will contain pictures and descriptions of 82 different kinds of sushi and the best thing is that Shogakukan said an English version is sure to follow ( a must download for me ) .
The company is already selling a special iPhone guide for Japanese mushrooms ( J ) .

Just when you think the folks on the left can't get any goofier , they go and surpass themselves .
If silliness were an Olympic event , these lunkheads could be counted on to bring home the gold .
The fool 's gold , that is .
Actually , they could probably excel in the sprints , seeing as how they 're not weighed down with a whole lot of common sense .
In case you have n't gotten the word , the religious left , as I like to think of them , seeing as how they live their lives by a certain dogma , have now determined that poor people are terribly under - represented on America 's college campuses .
It was , I suppose , only a matter of time .
After all , if no institute of higher education can justify its existence unless its student population is composed of X - percent of women , Hispanics , blacks , gays and the physically handicapped , some Democrat was bound to notice that there still remained an untapped source of future votes ; namely , poor , young whites .
Diversity in the student body is the catch phrase .
But , as you may have noticed , there is no parallel diversity along the faculties .
In the humanities departments of most American colleges , professors run the gamut from liberal to radical .
Given a choice between Ahmadinejad and a Republican , a large majority would vote for the little schmuck in the windbreaker .
Frankly , I see no reason to give preferential treatment to students for no better reason than that their parents are poor .
If a mix of humanity is what they 're really seeking , I say they should throw open the doors to idiots .
And , no , I 'm not referring to those aforementioned professors in the liberal arts who get paid a lot of money for doing nothing more than foisting their half - baked politics on a bunch of highly impressionable 18 - year - olds .
No , I 'm talking about the genuine article -- people with subterranean I.Q.s .
I mean , if diversity is of such monumental importance , why limit it to race , gender and national origin ?
Obviously , members of these groups have far more in common with each other than they have with the intellectually - challenged -- or whatever it is that the P.C. crowd is calling dumb people this week .
Honestly , I have n't a clue why college would be a more exalting experience just because the student in the next seat has different pigmentation or hails from a country where indoor plumbing is optional .
Admittedly , it 's been many years since I was a collegian .
Still , as I recall , the real value of the four years , aside from learning how to drink and how to talk to women without stuttering , was the enforced proximity to the minds and works of Socrates , Newton , Freud , Shakespeare , Plato , Milton , Michelangelo , Einstein , Da Vinci and Jefferson , and was neither enhanced nor diminished by the color or creed of the other students .
The truth of the matter was that my interest in my fellow scholars , and I do n't think my attitude was at all atypical , was limited to wanting to date the more attractive coeds and wanting to eviscerate those brainiacs most likely to raise the class curve .
Inasmuch as smart , poor kids already receive academic scholarships , one can only assume that it's the stupid ones whom the social engineers are trying to cram through the ivied portals .
But , inasmuch as once in , they 're destined to flunk out , I have a better solution .
I suggest we take our lead from " The Wizard of Oz . "
The Scarecrow , as you may recall , did n't waste four years boning up for final exams .
The great and powerful Oz merely handed him a diploma , and just like that , Ray Bolger was squaring the hypotenuse and jabbering away like a young William F. Buckley , Jr .
Why not give diplomas to anybody who wants one ?
In a day and age when people are wasting their parents ' hard - earned money majoring in things like Gay Studies , Sit Coms of the 60's , and Comic Books as Literature , why not do the decent thing and just hand out sheepskins to anyone who says , " Please " ?
A built - in bonus of my plan is that with all those goobers off the campuses , there would be additional parking spaces for the people studying to be doctors , mathematicians , and scientists .
After all , when all is said and done , most college graduates are n't really smarter than other people .
They just think they are .
Just as France presented the Statue of Liberty as its gift to the nation , the citizens of San Francisco may now bestow their own special gift to the country by renaming our award winning waste water treatment plant in honor of outgoing President George W Bush .
We think this is a fitting memorial for a truly outstanding Commander - in - Chief .
On matters ranging from diplomacy to fiscal and environmental stewardship , no other President has had such a dramatic impact on the country and the Constitution in such a short time .
Most presidents wait years or decades to receive their memorial airport or highway .
We think President Bush deserves immediate recognition for his eight years of public service .
Critics of this measure point out that the initiative unfairly maligns the talented and hard working staff at the award - winning plant or that it memorializes an administration best forgotten .
To this we simply say that those who forget history are condemned to repeat it .
President Bush has left us with a gigantic mess , and that this facility symbolizes the city 's deft ability to clean up its share of the financial and diplomatic mess left in this administration 's wake .
It will also become the world 's first presidential sewage plant , a potential tourist attraction , and therefore an opportunity for the dedicated plant workers to educate visitors about this essential and heretofore unknown public works .
This measure will have a minimal fiscal impact and may increase tourist traffic to the plant , Zoo , and nearby attractions in southwest San Francisco , creating yet another quirky must - see destination along with our cable cars , Haight St , and Beach Blanket Babylon .
Fellow San Franciscans , we urge you to vote Oui ! On November 4th .

Chairman , Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco Rebuttal to Arguments For While discussing the Russian incursion into South Ossetia on ABC's " This Week " , conservative George Will referred to Russia as a " primitive " country .
This reference is puzzling in light of Russia having produced geniuses like Tolstoy , Dostoevsky , Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev .
To describe an entire nation in such terms seems an extreme statement .
( Would the show 's host , George Stefanopoulos , have remained silent had Will similarly impugned the Greek nation ? )
Yet this remark should be understood in light of Will 's unspoken desire to ride up Brokeback Mountain with W. Maybe Vladimir Putin attacked Georgia because he hates freedom .
Or perhaps Putin invaded because he had to assist his homies who were under attack , just as the Israelis retaliate whenever their people are shot at or shelled .
What is not in question is that Putin had exposed Bush as an impotent buffoon : even were John " we are all Georgians " McCain , Will 's and ABC 's preferred candidate , to win this year 's election , Russia will not be expelled from the G - 8 .
No other country in NATO is going to send its troops to South Ossetia .
Like other neoconservatives , Will and his employers at ABC are enraged that Putin has punk'd their beloved Bush .
Rather than acknowledge that reality , they prefer to disparage the Russians as a bunch of primitives .
San Franciscans , take note : do n't vote for this measure just because you 're upset that Midland 's half - wit won the last election .
That 's the kind of statement that Will and the neocons would make .
Such name - calling is really ... primitive .

As of this writing , 4139 servicemen and women have been killed since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
The number of Iraqis who have been killed as a result of the invasion and occupation of their country cannot be measured .
The proponents of this measure may consider the Bush Administration to be a joke .
However , the consequences of the decision to invade are not a laughing matter for families of those who have died during the past five years .
This measure , whatever its intentions , disrespects them .
I agree that the invasion of Iraq is the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the US .
I also agree that Bush has been the most ignorant man to ever occupy the office of President .
To call him the worst President since Warren Harding is to insult the memory of Harding , who at least did not enter this country into any unnecessary wars .
Moreover , the federal debt at the end of this Administration totals over $ 9 trillion , not including the recent guarantees extended to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , whose liabilities may constitute an additional $ 5 trillion to be paid by the U.S. taxpayer .
Aside from Iraq , Bush 's legacy will be the addition of a prescription drug benefit of at least $ 1.2 trillion without any mechanism for funding the new Medicare entitlement .
Bush 's minions had specifically ordered the civil service from disclosing the true cost of the benefit from Congress before it had been voted upon .
Maybe it would be more appropriate to name the local bankruptcy court or a consumer credit counseling center after Bush ?
Besides , if we name the local sewage plant after Bush , then what 's left to name after Jesse Helms ?
Colin V. Gallagher Rebuttal to Arguments Against Fellow citizens , Mr. Gallagher 's opposing argument does as good a job as any we 've heard at highlighting why George W. Bush deserves this unique civic tribute .
Since we can't say it better ourselves we 'll share this haiku , submitted by one of the many supporters of this effort from San Francisco , around the country and abroad : Need Bush memor'l ?

How appropriate Brian McConnell , Chairman
Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco
Mr. O’Neill , for his part , pushed to alter the threshold for action against chief executives from “ recklessness ”  where a difficult finding of willful malfeasance would be necessary for action against a corporate chief  to negligence .
That is , if a company went south , the boss could face a hard - eyed appraisal from government auditors and be subject to heavy fines and other penalties .
By matching upside rewards with downside consequences  a bracing idea for the corner office  Messrs .
O’Neill and Greenspan hoped fear would compel the titans of business to enforce financial discipline , full public disclosure and probity down the corporate ranks .
But they were in the minority .
Mr. Pitt , the S.E.C. chairman , voiced concern that creation of a new entity to assess negligence by corporate honchos might draw power away from his agency .
Lawrence Lindsey said , “ There ’s always the option of doing nothing , ” that the markets are “ already discounting the stocks in companies that show accounting irregularities . ”
An article about the meeting appeared a few days later in The Wall Street Journal .
The next day , Mr. O’Neill was in Florida addressing chief executives of America ’s top 20 financial services companies .
They piled on .
One told the Treasury secretary that he ’d “ rather resign ” than be held accountable for “ what ’s going on in my company . ”
A phalanx of outraged financial industry chiefs , many of them large Republican contributors , called the White House .
Real reform was a political dead letter .
A presidential speech that followed was toothless , mostly recommending that chief executives personally certify their companies ’ financial statements .
Earnings per share remained the gold standard .
The Sarbanes - Oxley bill , signed into law a few months later , largely focused on the auditors , and actually increased the complexity of reporting practices .
As for lawsuits ?
Not to worry .
No significant rise .
At issue , of course , were those twins , transparency and accountability .
The years since have shown that the first one is meaningless without the second .
With a world financial crisis upon us , the president and his economic team are forced again to talk about accountability .
Let ’s hope this time they mean it .

It looks like Europeana is going to become a serious competitor of Google .
This new digital library was launched by the European Union this Thursday .
Now with a single click of your mouse you can get access to the world 's cultural heritage .
The website ( www.europeana.eu ) provides an impressive multi-lingual collection of two million books and other digitized items that were treasured in European museums and archives .
This is just the beginning .
By 2010 you 'll be able to find about 10 million items at this unique online library .
" Europeana offers a journey through time , across borders , and into new ideas of what our culture is .
More than that , it will connect people to their history and , through interactive pages and tools , to each other , " said , EU Information Society Commissioner .
The popularity of Europeana grows with incredible speed .
It had 10 million visitors just in an hour .
This fact demonstrates that people are really interested in the new project .
Jill Cousins , Europeana 's director , explained that Europeana was not developed with the gold of competing with Google .
Its mission is to offer people a reliable source of information provided by serious institutions with long - standing reputation .
Speaking about Google 's reaction to the project , it should be mentioned that it was quite positive .
Santiago de la Mora , head of Google 's book partnerships in Europe , said that such projects show that it 's very important to provide public access to the world funds of knowledge and authors , editors as well as technology enterprises can do it together .
The question of copyright remains vital .
Google in its turn paid $ 125 to sign a contract with authors and publishing firms .
In order to evade this problem , Europeana will offer works of public ownership at the first stage .
As the European Commission said , negotiations with rights holders are under way and very soon copyright works will replenish the library 's stock .

Arancini , the cult Sicilian dish

These glorified deep - fried stuffed rice croquettes are a cult sicilian dish celebrated in a recent best - selling Italian novel .
These glorified deep - fried stuffed rice croquettes are a cult sicilian dish celebrated in a recent best - selling Italian novel .
To most tourists , this is street food .
You do n't really get arancinis in restaurants .
But to Sicilians , this is a national sicilian emblem , cooked with time and love by their mothers and grandmothers .
Everybody knows a person ' who makes the best arancinis ' .
It could be preposterous for a Swiss to try and make such a difficult and symbolic dish , but I came well - equipped with some tastings and the absolute reference on Sicilian cuisine , Il diamante della grande cucina di Sicilia ( The Diamond of the Great Cuisine of Sicily ) , written by Sicilian theater director with a passion for food Pino Correnti .
Each recipe is explained in great details , with all the technicalities and tours - de-main as well as ample historical background .
What brought these glorified deep - fried stuffed rice croquettes such reverence ?
I am not sure .
But they certainly hold a high status in Sicily .
The most widely read author in Italia , Camilleri , whose ' Montalbano ' detective novels fostered a hugely successful string of 12 movies , wrote one of the novels around this dish .
In ' Gli arancini di Montalbano ' , the commissioner Montalbano goes to great lengths to ensure he can accept the invitation to eat arancinis on New Year 's Eve at one of his informants ' mother 's house .
Montalbano has to lie to his girlfriend who organised him a romantic trip to Paris , lie to his boss and forge evidence to ensure he gets his arancinis .
On the picture above you see the mother preparing the arancinis in the final scene .
You can download the episode from the RAI TV website if your Italian is any good .
Here is the paragraph in the book :
Gesù , gli arancini di Adelina !
Li aveva assaggiati solo una volta : un ricordo che sicuramente gli era tras ùto nel Dna , nel patrimonio genetico .
Adelina ci metteva due jornate sane sane a pripararli .
Ne sapeva , a memoria , la ricetta .
Il giorno avanti si fa un aggrassato di vitellone e di maiale in parti uguali che deve còciri a foco lentissimo per ore e ore con cipolla , pummadoro , sedano , prezzemolo e basilico .
Il giorno appresso si pripara un risotto , quello che chiamano alla milanisa ( senza zaffirano , Pi carità ! ) , lo si versa sopra a una tavola , ci si impastano le ova e lo si fa rifriddàre .
Intanto si còcino i pisellini , si fa una besciamella , si riducono a pezzettini na poco di fette di salame e si fa tutta una composta con la carne aggrassata , triturata a mano con la mezzaluna ( nenti frullatore , Pi carità di Dio ! ) .
Il suco della carne sammisca col risotto .
A questo punto si piglia tanticchia di risotto , sassistema nel palmo d'una mano fatta a conca , ci si mette dentro quanto un cucchiaio di composta e si copre con dell altro riso a formare una bella palla .
Ogni palla la si fa rotolare nella farina , poi si passa nel bianco d'ovo e nel pane grattato .
Doppo , tutti gli arancini s'infilano in una padeddra doglio bollente e si fanno friggere fino a quando pigliano un colore d'oro vecchio .
Si lasciano scolare sulla carta .

CHICAGO , Nov. 2 ( UPI ) -- Chicago police say they are investigating how a 1992 Chevrolet Lumina racked up nearly $ 4,000 in tickets in the year after it was presumed crushed .
Cheryl Thomas said the police became involved after notices seeking payment for nearly $ 4,000 were mailed to her home in Alsip , the Chicago Sun -Times reported Sunday .

" The police told me the car was destroyed , but it 's still moving around , " said Thomas , whose son , Gene , owned the car until it was impounded last year and ordered crushed by police after he failed to pay $ 500 in storage and towing fees , the Sun - Times reported .
During the next 12 months , toll cameras photographed the car nearly 200 times as it breezed through tollbooths without paying a cent , the Sun - Times reported .
Untangling the car 's recent history has been difficult with police reporting the car was crushed , not crushed , sold , then not sold , the Sun - Times reported , noting police say the car currently is undriveable and sitting in a city - owned lot , though police would not allow the Sun - Times to see the car .
I write a lot of about the battle among large technology corporations in this space and the importance of competitive checks and balances .
Yet Comcast seems to be growing into a super power with control over the very pipes that provide many of us with internet access , but without any real competition and often with government support .
Most places in this country get internet access through one or at most two providers .
That kind of concentration of power is increasingly a threat to the very foundation of business and society , as so many of us use the internet on one level or another to do our jobs , get our information and connect to one another .
Low Competition and Not forced to Share Pipes
Unlike the phone companies , which years ago were forced to share their copper wires with competitors who offer cheaper service , the US Supreme Court ruled years ago that cable companies did not share the same obligation ; which is a puzzling decision when you think about it .
If phone companies have to share their wires , why do n't the cable providers ?
In fact , when that decision was made back in 2005 , most cable companies did n't offer phone service .
They now do , yet they are still not required by regulators to behave in the same fashion as the phone companies .
The only difference here mind you is the type of wire .
Perhaps the only real difference is Comcast 's power base and the millions it 's spending in Washington to ensure that it is n't forced to play by the same rules .
We know from experience that as technology advances , it 's not unusual for government regulation to be slow to catch up , but we are far enough along the path at this point , and the lines between these types of services have become sufficiently blurred , that it makes little sense not to even the playing field and force competition .
Comcast 's Big and It's Getting Bigger
Just recently Comcast bought NBC Universal , which means as we move forward ( assuming the deal is approved , and there 's little reason to believe it wo n't ) , that Comcast will not only own the cable , but they 'll be producing their own content as well .
Some have suggested that this deal is similar to the Time Warner / AOL deal that proved to be a huge failure , but AOL was a company in decline at the purchase time .
Comcast and NBCU are healthy companies .
While it 's always possible that cultural clashes and poor implementation could eventually torpedo the deal , for now , it leaves Comcast in an extremely powerful position controlling both content creation and the distribution system that both it and its content production competitors must use .
Not exactly a recipe for competitive pressure and all of the positive results that competition brings .
Let 's Build Our Own
One way out of this , is to create municipal internet access , an idea that was bandied about quite frequently before our economic meltdown .
A story in this week 's Valley Advocate , an alternative weekly newspaper that publishes in western Massachusetts , applauds an effort by my hometown of Amherst , MA to create its own small wireless network within the confines of its cozy downtown .
The network , a product of a partnership between UMass Amherst and the town , with the help of some hefty grants , provides a snapshot of how we could create these types of systems independent of the larger providers like Comcast .
In tough economic times , it 's hard to put the burden for such systems onto cities and towns already struggling to cover existing costs , but the economy will rebound eventually , and when it does , having wireless networks on the long - term plan will help push these ideas forward and perhaps begin to chip away at the alarmingly growing power of companies like Comcast to control our access to the internet .
One third of all requests to Internet service providers to remove stolen copyrighted material from their servers could likely be defeated in court , according to a study of some 900 notices by two legal experts .
The survey examined takedown notices served to Google and another large Internet provider under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) Section 512 .
Two provisions of that section require that hosting providers and search providers remove content and links to content in order to gain exemption from possible copyright lawsuits .
The music and movie industry typically use a different provision of the section to ask for suspected infringers to be cut off from the Internet .
According to the study , thirty percent of the notices could be readily challenged in court on clear grounds , such as a substantial fair - use argument and the likelihood that the material is uncopyrightable .
One out of 11 notices had such a significant legal flaw - such as not identifying the infringing material - as to render the notice unusable .
Moreover , more than half of the notices for link removal that were sent to Google were sent by businesses targeting apparent rivals , the report said .
While the authors of the study admit it uses a small sample set , the conclusions support contentions that the DMCA has been used to hobble expression on the Internet , even among security researchers , who have an explicit exemption in the law .
The row with media giant Sony BMG over its controversial copy protection technology had some researchers worried that investigating the protection would place them at hazard from a DMCA lawsuit .
If more Internet service providers published every takedown notice they receive , as Google does , a more statistically valid study could be performed , the authors stated .
