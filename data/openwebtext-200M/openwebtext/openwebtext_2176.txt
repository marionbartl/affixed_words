Eclipse 3.4 " Ganymede " will be released in the upcoming days .
I 've been working with the RC builds for some time now and I like it .
Eclipse 3.4 is a better IDE and a more robust platform than its ' predecessor .
In this post , I 've gathered some new features which I like and may be " off the beaten path " .
Rich Hovers
This is not a hidden feature , but I had to mention it .
The Java Development
Tools include some interesting enhancements in this release .
The greatest innovation is the Java Editor Breadcrumbs .
It looks cool , but , after using it for some time , I did n't find it very useful .
The Rich Hovers , on the other hand , are very useful .
I especially like the Javadoc hovers .
There 's an emphasis in making the documentation accessible and that 's a very positive improvement .
Another useful rich hover is the Java debug hover which makes it easier to view the contents of compound objects without having to copy them to the expressions view .
You can use the preferences to determine whether the behavior of the " enriched hovers " .
The Dropins Folder
If you paid attention to the hype around Eclipse 3.4 , you 've heard the term P2 .
In simple terms , it 's a new way of deploying Eclipse applications and plug-ins .
For the average Eclipse user , the most noticeable change will be a new " Software Update " dialog which replaces the previous " Find & Install ... " and " Manage Configuration " duo .
It 's a much better UI and it's a promising future to Eclipse updates .
Part of this change is " the dropins folder " .
This folder is located in your Eclipse distribution folder and it is initially empty .
In this folder you can manually drop features and plugins which will be installed once you restart Eclipse .
No more restarting with " - clean " option .
There 's also an option of using this folder to link to a central location of plugins , which can be shared among several Eclipse installations .
I 'll write a dedicated post about it in the future .
Templates View
One of the late features to make it into the Eclipse 3.4 .
Templates can be inserted while coding , usually using the content assistant .
Adding and editing templates was possible before .
In Eclipse 3.4 there 's a new view which shows all possible templates and makes it easier to add new templates .
There are also some new parameters which can be used when composing template .
Templates are already an important feature .
The templates view makes this feature even more user friendly , especially for customizations .
The view is found in the views under " General " - " Templates " .
Look in the Eclipse help for more details on the template variables .
Format Only Edited Lines
The " Save Actions " is one of my favorite features in Eclipse 3.3 ( read my original post about it ) .
In Eclipse 3.4 there are several improvements including some new formatting features .
One of the complaints against the Save Actions feature was that it will change the entire file , thus , making it very hard to compare to previous revisions when using a source control .
It can become very annoying if some team members use it and some do n't .
For that purpose there 's a new feature which allows changing just the edited lines , keeping the rest of the file intact .
I highly recommend using the Save Actions feature .
It is inactive by default , so go ahead and activate it .
Outline View Drag & Drop
This is a true hidden treasure .
You can now easily rearrange your source code by dragging and dropping elements in the outline view .
AFAIK , this currently works for Java and for XMLs .
To use it , make sure the " sort " option is not selected and just drag & drop .
Plug-in Spy
There are many new features in the Plug - in Development Environment ( PDE ) project which makes writing and deploying Eclipse plugins much easier .
The Plug - in spy is a true hidden gem in this stack .
One of the best ways to learn how to write plug-ins is to read the code of existing plug-ins .
Naturally , the organic Eclipse plug-ins make great candidates .
You see a view and you want to create something similar .
The question is : how do you find the code behind that view ?
This is where the plug - in spy comes into play .
Invoke the plug - in spy and you 'll get all the information that you need to start exploring the existing code .
The plug - in spy can be invoked using the keyboard shortcut Shit + Option + F1 ( Alt + Shift + F1 on Windows ) .
It works on views and in dialogs as well , including the wizard and preferences dialog .
Error Log View
The error log view is not new .
It shows platform errors and informational messages .
It was greatly improved in Eclipse 3.4 , with a search box and a grouping feature .
It 's all good , but , there 's one cool feature tucked away in the toolbar .
You can quickly use the log view to view the logs of workspaces you launched when running or debugging plug-ins .
It shows all the defined launch configuration .
Each launch configuration is associated with a runtime workspace .
The log of this workspace will be shown when that configuration is selected .
Export / Import Launch Configurations Launch configurations are an important part of the workspace .
Every once in a while I start over and create a new workspace after having too much garbage in the old one .
Importing the projects is a breeze .
It 's the configuration that takes time .
Most of the configuration can be exported and imported and now the launch configuration are included .
Since creating launch configurations can be time consuming , this is a much needed feature .
Start from the " File " menu and select the " Export " feature .
Select the " Launch Configurations " and in the next dialog box select the configurations to export .
The result is a folder of XMLs which can be later imported to any workspace .
God is in the Details
The features I mentioned above are mostly major feature .
Eclipse 3.4 also includes an assortment of small improvements for making your life easier .
The content assistant , for example , is improved , and it works in cases where it did n't before .
Argument name guessing is much improved and can now also guess methods which may be called to produce the arguments ( e.g. getters ) .
There are many new feature you 'll discover once you start using the new version .
" Ganymede " is a great release for the Eclipse platform .

The Kenya Anti Corruption Commission & Internet Censorship in Kenya – an Exercise in Futility
MWALIMU MATI ( CEO , Mars Group Kenya )
May 29 , 2008
In what amounts to an excellent impact indicator , the Government of Kenya is blocking access to one of its own websites , according to a Daily Nation story by Fred Mukinda .
The website in question belongs to the Kenya Anti Corruption Commission !
For the last year or so , the Kenya Anti Corruption Commission has been using an anonymous whistleblower reporting web based system developed by a German firm .
The BKMS system allows whistleblowers to open accounts online and to make anti-corruption complaints , and if necessary submit documents ; safe in the knowledge that no - one will now who they are ( not even KACC ) unless they choose to reveal their identity .
According to the Daily Nation story “ Whistleblowers ’ Computer Link Cut ” which quotes the KACC spokesman , Nick Simani , “ a few Government departments ” are trying to monitor or restrict access to the KACC system by government computers .
Some “ senior officials ” have instructed IT personnel to monitor civil servants visits to “ forbidden web pages ” such as those of the KACC corruption reporting system .
Until , we have a whistle blowing law in Kenya such behaviour by Government ( as suspicious as it looks ) is not illegal .
Whistle blowing legislation will come , and it will criminalize such behaviour , because Kenya signed and ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption on December 9th 2003 – and is therefore obliged to make what these “ senior officials ” are doing illegal .
In the meantime , KACC should put its foot down and publish the names of the Government Departments involved .
When we checked the only ministry which had a direct link to the BKMS was the Ministry of Tourism .
This incident shows clearly , that some people in the Government of Kenya are afraid that internet whistle blowing can bring accountability to bear in frightening ways .
They are right to worry .
Technology is making whistle blowing easier and safer and there is even a Kenyan precedent .
Last year a long suppressed government commissioned investigation report by Kroll & Associates leaked from within the Kenyan Government and ended up on Wikileaks , the mother of all anti-corruption whistle blowing websites in the world about 4 months before the elections of 2007 .
In months to follow , the Kenya related content on that site grew at such a rate that an entire page is today devoted to Kenyan leaks .
Apart from the infamous Looting of Kenya series , there is never before seen material about the Charterhouse Bank investigation ; a confidential World Bank investigation of its road projects in Kenya ; a payroll scandal at Egerton University ; and material related to the Presidential election of 2007 including secret political party documents .
Wikileaks to a large extent made its bones on these Kenyan exposes , and has gone on to defeat powerful enemies of transparency ranging from secretive banks through the military to religions and freemasonry .
Earlier this year it won a precedent setting internet freedom of expression court battle in San Francisco , in which the Judge actually reversed himself .
The moral of the story ?
The genie is well and truly out of the bottle .
To those within Government who are minded to try , we would say : “ It is an exercise in futility to instruct your IT departments to block staff access to the KACC website .
It is really futile !
If it ’s not the KACC system , it will be Wikileaks .
And that ’s one place where your ‘ seniority ’ wo n’t count . ”

PYONYANG , North Korea ( CNN ) -- North Korea took a step closer to easing international fears about its nuclear activities Thursday when it released documents expected to detail its plutonium stockpile to China , Chinese officials confirmed to CNN .
The U.S. State Department also confirmed that the relevent documents had been handed over to China .
The Chinese are now due to pass the papers to the U.S. State Department , which is then expected to announce that North Korea is off the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism .
" The United States will implement its obligation to remove the designation of ( North Korea ) as a state sponsor of terrorism , " said Wu Dawei , China 's vice foreign minister , before the handover was announced .
Under an agreement hammered out in six-nation talks that included the United States and China , North Korean leaders agreed to provide a full account of the plutonium , and " acknowledge " concerns about its nuclear proliferation and uranium enrichment activities .
North Korea will also continue to cooperate with a process to ensure that no further activities are taking place .
The agreement includes additional monitoring to assure Pyongyang receives promised economic and energy assistance in exchange for dismantling its nuclear program .
On Friday , North Korea is set to implode a cooling tower on its Yongbyon nuclear reactor .
Nuclear experts have already begun dismantling the plant 's main reactor .
But the destruction of the cooling tower is expected to be a powerful public symbol -- as well as a step that would take more than a year to reverse , according to U.S. State Department officials .
Watch a report on the step toward curbing N. Korea 's nuclear activities »
In a rare move , North Korea has invited international news organizations , including CNN , to witness the tower 's destruction .
Speaking last week , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said that once Pyonyang hands over the declaration , U.S. President George W. Bush will announce that North Korea has been removed from the state - sponsored terrorism list and will lift some sanctions against the nation that were levied because of nuclear concerns .
The lifting of the sanctions will have no immediate effect , however , because similar sanctions are in place under other areas of U.S. law , Rice said .
Under the six - party agreement , a 45 - day review period will begin after the declaration is handed over .
During that time , international nuclear officials will examine the documents to make sure they are accurate and complete .
The six - party talks also included South Korea , Japan and Russia .
During negotiations , the United States ultimately softened demands that North Korea admit to having a highly enriched uranium program and supplying Syria with nuclear technology -- sticking points that had stalled the talks for months .
Rice said the final deal was n't perfect , but offered the United States its best chance yet to learn about North Korea 's nuclear activities .

All About North Korea
SAN DIEGO , California ( CNN ) --
For the last six months , one of the media 's most convenient -- and offensive -- narratives has been that Latinos would n't vote for Barack Obama because they refused to support an African - American for president .
Ruben Navarrette says more Latino voters will support Barack Obama than John McCain in the general election .
Pundits , columnists and bloggers agreed and offered outlandish explanations mentioning everything from the turf wars between Latino and African - American gangs in U.S. cities to the fact that Latin America is full of countries where race and skin color can determine social mobility .
Well , what do you know ?
Now , it seems Latinos will support Obama after all -- meaning that everything you 've heard to the contrary up to now is rubbish .
A new Gallup Poll summary of surveys taken in May shows Obama winning 62 percent of Latino voters nationwide , compared with 29 percent for McCain .
The pro-Democratic group Democracy Corps compiled surveys from March through May that showed Obama with a 19 - point lead among Latinos .
And a Los Angeles Times poll last month showed Obama leading McCain by 14 points among Latinos in California .
I 'm not surprised .
As I have been writing for months , Latinos have n't been voting against Barack Obama as much as they 've been voting for Hillary Clinton .
Give the senator from New York credit .
She took full advantage of Obama 's late start in courting Latino voters , and she had the benefit of what remains a popular brand with Latinos : Clinton , Inc .
Even so , while Obama got trounced by Clinton in the competition for Latino voters in California , Texas , New York , he kept the contest close in Arizona , Utah , New Mexico .
And he won the Latino vote in Colorado , Connecticut , Virginia .
But , in the last several weeks , as it became clear that Obama was on his way to securing the Democratic nomination and that Clinton 's campaign was running out of gas , Latinos seem to have migrated to Obama .
Now that the Illinois senator has become the presumptive nominee , and Hillary has suspended her campaign and endorsed him , Latinos really have only two choices -- go with Obama , or vote for John McCain .
Choice No. 2 is not such a bad option .
McCain would make an excellent president .
And , in fact , I suspect that , when all is said and done , many Latinos -- perhaps as much as 35 percent -- will put their support behind him .
Not because they have anything against Obama , but because McCain has -- for more than 15 years and long before the immigration issue became prominent -- had an outstanding record of reaching out to Latino voters , earning as much as 70 percent of the Latino vote in his Senate re-election campaigns in Arizona .
But make no mistake , when all is said and done , Obama will win the votes of a majority of Latinos .
Ironically , he 's going to benefit in the general election from the same thing that made it tough for him to win Latinos votes against Clinton in the primary : brand loyalty .
This time , the brand is the Democratic Party , and with just one Democrat on the ballot , that 's where most Latinos will put their support .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration plans to brief U.S. lawmakers behind closed doors on Thursday about North Korea ’s suspected nuclear cooperation with Syria , congressional sources said on Tuesday .
Sung Kim , a U.S. State Department official in charges of Korean affairs , reacts as he listens to reporters ' questions upon his arrival at the Incheon international airport , west of Seoul , April 21 , 2008 .

The White House has said little in public about the issue since Israel conducted a mysterious September 6 air strike inside Syria that U.S. media reports said was directed at a nuclear site that may have been built with North Korean assistance .
While a handful of lawmakers were briefed on the issue last year , the decision to widen the circle substantially comes as Washington appears closer to a deal for North Korea to provide a long overdue declaration of its nuclear programs .
Once the poor , communist state has produced the declaration , the United States is expected to ease sanctions on Pyongyang that flow from its presence on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and the U.S. Trading With the Enemy Act .
A senior congressional aide and a former Bush administration North Korea specialist said they believed the briefings were designed to persuade members of Congress that removing those sanctions was justified .
Congressional sources said the briefings would be for members of the House of Representatives and Senate committees that deal with armed services , foreign affairs and intelligence .
Spokesmen for the White House and for the office of the Director of National Intelligence declined comment .
“ The administration routinely keeps appropriate members of Congress informed of national security and intelligence matters , but I ’m going to decline to comment on any specific briefings , ” said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
Asked why the briefings were happening now , the senior congressional aide said , “ Because they are about to lift sanctions ... and they want to convince members that we have enough clarity from what the North Koreans have acknowledged to us , and what we have learned through our own methods , to proceed with confidence . ”
COMPROMISE WITH NORTH KOREA
“ Otherwise , they are just setting themselves up for legislative obstructionism on the lifting of the sanctions , ” the aide added .
Michael Green , a former National Security Council official now at the CSIS think tank , said a compromise the United States and North Korea reached recently in Singapore on the declaration had run into congressional resistance .
Under that compromise , North Korea would produce a declaration of its plutonium - related program but would address suspicions on nuclear proliferation with Syria and on its suspected uranium enrichment program in a different way .
According to people familiar with the plan , Washington would put forward its concerns about North Korea ’s suspected uranium enrichment program and nuclear proliferation and North Korea would then “ acknowledge the U.S. concerns . ”
“ The news about the Singapore agreement is becoming public and some members on the Hill ... are realizing that the Singapore agreement does not cover proliferation with Syria or the uranium enrichment program , ” Green said .
“ The administration is now being asked , in order to ( win ) congressional support for lifting sanctions ... to explain more details about the parts that are no longer covered ( by the declaration ) , ” he added .
“ As Congress looks at the details , it might make it much harder ( to get that support ) . ”
North Korea ’s failure to produce the declaration has bogged down a 2005 multilateral deal under which it committed to abandon all nuclear weapons and programs .
The so - called six - party agreement was hammered out among the two Koreas , China , Japan , Russia and the United States .
The declaration has been held up partly because of Pyongyang ’s reluctance to discuss any transfer of nuclear technology to other countries , notably Syria , as well as to account for its suspected pursuit of uranium enrichment .
Uranium enrichment could provide North Korea with a second way to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons in addition to its plutonium - based program , which it used to test an atomic device in October 2006 .

When astronauts overhaul the Hubble Space Telescope this summer , they will leave behind a vastly more powerful orbital observatory to scan the universe .
Set to launch aboard NASA 's shuttle Atlantis on Aug. 7 , the Hubble servicing mission will be the fifth — and final — sortie to upgrade the aging space telescope .
" We 're not only going up to Hubble to refurbish it , but also to expand its grasp tremendously , " said Alan Stern , associate administrator for NASA 's science mission directorate , in a recent briefing .
" We expect to make the very best discoveries of the entire two - decade plus Hubble program with the new instruments to be installed . "
A deeper look In addition to performing vital repairs , astronauts will add two new instruments to Hubble 's observation platform — Wide Field Camera - 3 and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph — that will drastically boost its vision range .
" This refurbished Hubble [ will be ] a new telescope , " said astronomer Sandra Faber of the University of California , Santa Cruz .
" We estimate that at the end of this repair Hubble will be 90 times more powerful than when it was first launched . "
That means that Hubble will be able to see at least 90 times more objects in deep space than it could when it was deployed in April 1990 , she added .
With its ability to scan the universe at wavelengths ranging from the near - infrared , visible spectrum to the near - ultraviolet , the new Wide Field Camera - 3 should allow Hubble to see objects that formed fewer than 800 million years after the beginning of the universe .
" To follow galaxy formation to times that are even earlier than this , we need a camera that can take sharp pictures efficiently at longer wavelengths , " Faber said .
" And that 's exactly what Wide Field Camera - 3 is going to do . "
The new camera has better resolution than its Wide Field Planetary Camera - 2 predecessor and a wider field of view than Hubble 's current NICMOS spectrometer , and could reveal objects that formed when the universe was just 400 or 500 million years old , she added .
" A difference like this makes a huge difference in the structure and formation of the galaxies that we 'll see , " Faber said .
Astronomers currently estimate that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old .
Hubble 's new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph , meanwhile , will scan the universe in the ultraviolet range with about 10 times more sensitivity than the observatory 's current tools .
" I believe it 's the most sensitive UV spectroscopic capability ever to fly in space for astronomical purposes , " said Hubble senior project scientist David Leckrone of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland .
" It 's designed , because it 's so sensitive , to go as deep as possible out across the universe as fast as possible . "
Researchers hope the new spectrograph will map the so - called cosmic web , the universe 's large - scale structure made up of strands of galaxies that branch out in three dimensions like an astronomical spider 's web .
" It is amazing to me how we 've been able to reinvent the Hubble Space Telescope with each of these missions , " said astronaut John Grunsfeld , who will serve as the lead spacewalker for the telescope 's last overhaul .
Full power ahead Hubble service astronauts will also replace failed gyroscopes , fine guidance sensor and aged batteries , and make unprecedented repairs to the space telescope 's main camera and a vital spectrograph .
" When the astronauts leave Hubble for the last time , it will be at the apex of its capabilities , " said Leckrone .
" It will be the first time since 1993 that there will be five working instruments aboard . "
Spacewalkers will replace Hubble 's cracked thermal insulation and replace each of its 16 - year - old batteries among other hardware .
They will also repair the observatory 's Space Telescope Imaging Spectroscope and the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) , both of which were never designed to be fixed in orbit .
Spacewalkers will remove more than 111 tiny screws to repair the two units .
" The good news is we 're going to try and repair ACS .
The bad news is we 've never done it before , " said Grunsfeld .
" It 's very tricky . "
Grunsfeld and his six crewmates plan to stage five spacewalks to service Hubble during their STS - 125 mission .
NASA initially canceled the spaceflight following the 2003 Columbia tragedy , but later reinstated the mission after a detailed risk analysis .
The result , researchers said , is about five extra years of science for Hubble before its controlled deorbit sometime after 2020 .
To prepare for the space telescope 's eventual demise , spacewalkers will also attach a connecting port that will allow a robotic tug to dock with Hubble .
" None of us could have imagined what this fourth - generation suite of instruments can do , " said Stern , adding the 90 - fold jump in observation power for Hubble will be unprecedented .
" We will have the capability , literally , of approximately 100 Hubbles [ circa ] 1990 when this mission is done . "

Kevin Rudd is expected to announce a new deal to make hybrid cars in Australia when he visits the headquarters of giant carmaker Toyota in Japan today .
There is speculation that Mr Rudd will use the trip to the Nagoya plant to announce a deal for the company to start producing Camry hybrid family sedans at its Altona plant outside Melbourne .
The Japanese media is tipping Toyota to make a big announcement on the expansion of its hybrid - manufacturing plants in Australia and Thailand .
The Federal Government has declined to confirm reports of the Altona deal .
Australian Manufacturing Workers Union spokesman Dave Oliver says the move would give the embattled local car industry a strong footing for the future .
" We need to consider the type of vehicles people will be driving in the next 10 to 20 years and positioning the Australian manufacturing industry of motor vehicles to be well - positioned to meet that - not only for the domestic market , but also position itself for import - export strategies , " he said .
" For every one direct job that is produced , there 's six or seven related others in in service sectors or auto component sectors , and the benefits will flow from there . "
The Chamber of Automotive Industries says producing the new hybrid vehicle at Altona will help restore confidence in Australia 's car industry .
Spokesman Andrew McKellar says he is keen to see the details of the announcement .
" It would be an extremely significant development and indeed a very exciting development , " he said .
Later in the day , Mr Rudd will visit an exhibition in Tokyo of works by Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye .
The collection is believed to be the largest ever international show of works by an Australian artist .
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have developed sensors that could be mounted on bridges , aircraft or other large structures to constantly search for faults and flaws , possibly giving officials time to head off disasters like the recent Interstate 35 W collapse in Minneapolis .
The Sandia engineers are working on several kinds of sensors .
One of them , a self - adhesive rubber patch stuck to the surface of a bridge , would be able to detect cracks propagating through the structure by registering changes in air pressure .
Another involves a kind of smart paint that could help detect cracks .
A network of permanently mounted sensors would be able to constantly monitor the structure and alert engineers to developing flaws before they become a real problem .

A newly created microbe produces cellulose that can be turned into ethanol and other biofuels , report scientists from The University of Texas at Austin who say the microbe could provide a significant portion of the nation 's transportation fuel if production can be scaled up .
Along with cellulose , the cyanobacteria developed by Professor R. Malcolm Brown Jr. and Dr. David Nobles Jr. secrete glucose and sucrose .
These simple sugars are the major sources used to produce ethanol .
" The cyanobacterium is potentially a very inexpensive source for sugars to use for ethanol and designer fuels , " says Nobles , a research associate in the Section of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics .
Brown and Nobles say their cyanobacteria can be grown in production facilities on non-agricultural lands using salty water unsuitable for human consumption or crops .
Other key findings include :
The new cyanobacteria use sunlight as an energy source to produce and excrete sugars and cellulose
Glucose , cellulose and sucrose can be continually harvested without harming or destroying the cyanobacteria ( harvesting cellulose and sugars from true algae or crops , like corn and sugarcane , requires killing the organisms and using enzymes and mechanical methods to extract the sugars )
Cyanobacteria that can fix atmospheric nitrogen can be grown without petroleum - based fertilizer input
Nobles made the new cyanobacteria ( also known as blue - green algae ) by giving them a set of cellulose - making genes from a non-photosynthetic " vinegar " bacterium , Acetobacter xylinum , well known as a prolific cellulose producer .
advertisement
The new cyanobacteria produce a relatively pure , gel - like form of cellulose that can be broken down easily into glucose .
" The problem with cellulose harvested from plants is that it 's difficult to break down because it 's highly crystalline and mixed with lignins [ for structure ] and other compounds , " Nobles says .
He was surprised to discover that the cyanobacteria also secrete large amounts of glucose or sucrose , sugars that can be directly harvested from the organisms .
" The huge expense in making cellulosic ethanol and biofuels is in using enzymes and mechanical methods to break cellulose down , " says Nobles .
" Using the cyanobacteria escapes these expensive processes . "
Sources being used or considered for ethanol production in the United States include switchgrass and wood ( cellulose ) , corn ( glucose ) and sugarcane ( sucrose ) .
True algae are also being developed for biodiesel production .
advertisement
Brown sees a major benefit in using cyanobacteria to produce ethanol is a reduction in the amount of arable land turned over to fuel production and decreased pressure on forests .
" The pressure is on all these corn farmers to produce corn for non-food sources , " says Brown , the Johnson & Johnson Centennial Chair in Plant Cell Biology .
" That same demand , for sucrose , is now being put on Brazil to open up more of the Amazon rainforest to produce more sugarcane for our growing energy needs .
We do n't want to do that .
You 'll never get the forests back . "
Brown and Nobles calculate that the approximate area needed to produce ethanol with corn to fuel all U.S. transportation needs is around 820,000 square miles , an area almost the size of the entire Midwest .
They hypothesize they could produce an equal amount of ethanol using an area half that size with the cyanobacteria based on current levels of productivity in the lab , but they caution that there is a lot of work ahead before cyanobacteria can provide such fuel in the field .
Work with laboratory scale photobioreactors has shown the potential for a 17 - fold increase in productivity .
If this can be achieved in the field and on a large scale , only 3.5 percent of the area growing corn could be used for cyanobacterial biofuels .
Cyanobacteria are just one of many potential solutions for renewable energy , says Brown .
" There will be many avenues to become completely energy independent , and we want to be part of the overall effort , " Brown says .
" Petroleum is a precious commodity .
We should be using it to make useful products , not just burning it and turning it into carbon dioxide . "
Brown and Nobles are now researching the best methods to scale up efficient and cost - effective production of cyanobacteria .

After Kara " Starbuck "
Thrace made her miraculous return to Battlestar Galactica at the beginning of season four , she told anyone who would listen that she had intuitive knowledge of the way to Earth .
Most of the others in the fleet are understandably skeptical of her claims – they 're frankly suspicious of her very existence ( and let 's not even mention the condition of her Viper ) , since in their experience she clearly died , and only Cylons can return from the dead .
In typical Starbuck fashion , she responds to their skepticism by beating up two marines , injuring other marines with a concussion grenade and taking the president hostage .
In response to this criminal activity , Adm. William Adama ( who has got to be the most lenient hard - ass since John Wayne in The Shootist ) rewards his little girl with the keys to a ship of her own , and an indulgent daddy 's hope that she will follow her dream to wherever it leads .
OK , seriously , he knows that Starbuck has a shot at finding Earth , and by now he 's desperate enough to try anything .
He gives her the Demetrius , a filthy sewage - processing ship , and a hand - picked crew of 15 .
Their mission is to follow Starbuck 's intuition until they find Earth .
When they 've recorded Earth 's position , they are to rendezvous with the fleet in two months ' time with the information .
If they do not make the rendezvous , Adama will have no choice but to consider Demetrius destroyed , and the fleet will be forced to move on without them .
Obviously , such a mission offers many ways to frak up .
The crew could fail to find Earth .
They could miss their rendezvous and be stranded alone in space , condemned to die when their supplies run out ( though as a sewage - reprocessing plant , they probably wo n't run out of food any time soon ) .
They could find Earth yet miss their rendezvous , saving themselves but condemning nearly 40,000 souls to wander aimlessly through space .
No wonder everyone on the Demetrius is coated with a sheen of sweat .
Galactica producer Ron Moore has said that he was going for a Das Boot look on the Demetrius , which makes sense stylistically – in our current society , scantily clad people shimmering with sweat are sexy .
But is that the only reason ?
Ca n't it just be too damn hot in the spacecraft ?
It 's a common belief that the temperature of space is freezing cold , nearly absolute zero .
Like many common beliefs , it 's wrong .
Space has no temperature .
Let 's say that again : Space has no temperature .
To be more specific , let 's fall back to The Second Rule of The Science of Battlestar Galactica : " Space is mostly empty .
That 's why it 's called space . "
Except for those regions of space that are filled with a gaseous nebula , or a star , or a planet , or an asteroid , or a comet , or a moon , or a spaceship , there 's nothing in space to have a temperature .
And , as we 'll see , it 's very difficult to change the temperature of something in space .
In 1891 , Scottish scientist James Dewar was developing a way to chill oxygen to the point where it liquefied , and to do so in industrial quantities .
He found that making liquid oxygen was comparatively much easier than storing it – the moment he turned off his refrigeration apparatus , the oxygen immediately boiled back into a gas .
Dewar needed a container that would resist changes in temperature , keeping his cold fluid cold without need for refrigerating equipment .
By the following year , he had his solution : two thin - walled glass flasks , one inside the other .
The outer flask was coated with silver , like a mirror , and both flasks were joined together at the neck .
Then ( and this was the important part ) , the air between the two flasks was pumped out , leaving behind a vacuum .
The resulting " vacuum flask " kept his liquid oxygen cold for days without any additional refrigeration , and its relative cheapness allowed Dewar to pretty much invent the science of cryogenics , the study of very cold stuff .
( Vacuum flasks in the scientific / engineering world are still called Dewars in his honor . )
The thermos bottle inside your Battlestar Galactica lunch box is simply a smaller , consumer - grade version of a Dewar vacuum flask .
Dewars and thermos bottles work by minimizing all opportunity for heat transfer between the contents of the flask and the outside world .
This is surprisingly easy to do .
Heat can only move from one substance to another in three ways :
1. Conduction
2. Convection
3. Radiation
Conduction is when heat moves by direct physical contact between one substance and another .
Turn on an electric stove , and watch the coils heat to a dull red .
Place a pan on that coil , and the heat of the coils will transfer through conduction directly to the pan .
By isolating the inner flask of a thermos bottle from almost all contact with the outside world , the chance for thermal conduction is kept to a minimum .
Of course , no system is perfect :
The most thermodynamically vulnerable spot of any thermos bottle is the neck , where the two flasks have to be joined together .
This is the only spot where conductive heat transfer can take place , and because of this , you 'll notice that the neck is very heavily insulated on most thermos bottles .
Convection is when a moving fluid carries heat from one place to another .
In old - fashioned steam heating systems , water carries heat from the boiler ( usually deep in the basement ) to rooms throughout the building .
The radiator in each room provides another kind of convection – it heats the air ( which is , after all , another kind of fluid ) , and the circulating air warms the room .
By keeping a vacuum between the inner and outer flasks , thermos bottles prevent convective heat transfer by denying fluid transfer between hot places and cold places .
Radiation is when heat moves from a hot place to a cold place through the use of electromagnetic radiation .
With no fluid medium between the two bodies , this is the only way the sun 's heat can get to the Earth , and the only way the Earth 's heat can dissipate into space .
Radiative heat transfer works well across a vacuum , so theoretically a thermos bottle can lose heat this way .
But by coating both sides of the outer flask with a mirrorlike substance , most of the radiative heat can be reflected away .
( This , incidentally , answers the perennial question :
How does a thermos flask know to keep hot stuff hot and cold stuff cold ?
The answer is , of course , it does n't .
The only thing a thermos flask " knows " how to do is to slow down the equalization temperature between the contents and the outside world .
By doing its best to prevent heat from moving into or out of the flask , it naturally keeps hot contents hot , and cold contents cold . )
So how does this apply to the Demetrius ?
Well , it turns out that a ship in space is like the inner flask in a thermos bottle .
Its heat can't be conducted or convected away .
It can be radiated away , but Demetrius seems pretty squat and compact – its available surface area is probably pretty small compared to its volume , and that limits its radiative ability .
When you factor in a shipload of electronic equipment , all producing heat , and 15 human bodies , all producing heat , you quickly reach a situation in which Demetrius can't get rid of all the heat it generates .
And so all those half - clad sculpted bodies become coated with a sexy sheen of sweat .

Rolling Stone reporter Matt Taibbi had this to say about Mike Huckabee :
Huckabee at most times is gentle and self - deprecating in his public address , but when he talks about religion , he gets weirdly combative and obnoxious , often drifting into outright offensiveness .
At one appearance , Huckabee -- who 's been known to make fart jokes in front of the state legislature -- said he would oppose gay marriage " until Moses comes down with two stone tablets from Brokeback Mountain saying he 's changed the rules . "
And he recently scored a rare offend trifecta , simultaneously pissing off immigrants , Jews and the pro-choice crowd when he ludicrously claimed that a " holocaust " of abortions had artificially created a demand for Mexican labor .
Huckabee also has a televangelist 's knack for getting caught with his fingers in various cookie jars .
In his first year as governor , Huck used a $ 60,000 taxpayer fund for personal expenses like dog food , pantyhose and meals at Taco Bell .
( One of his sons -- also a very heavy man , as his father was -- reportedly joked that " there 's not a Huckabee alive that can eat at Taco Bell for seven dollars . " )
The governor also tried to keep $ 70,000 in furnishings for the governor 's mansion supplied by a local cotton grower , and used inaugural funds to pay for clothes for his wife .
" Mike is first and foremost about Mike , " says Brantley .
" He 'll nickel - and - dime whoever he can to line his pockets . "
Huckabee has also been accused of paying himself as a consultant to his own senatorial campaign , allowing special interests to pay for airline tickets for his daughter , receiving a canoe from a Coke bottler and -- hilariously , if you 're wont to laugh at the sheer small - town gauche greediness of it all -- setting up a " wedding registry " at Target and Dillard 's department stores so citizens could lavish the Huckabees with gifts as they renewed their marriage vows .
The long list of desired goodies included twenty - four settings of Lenox " Holiday Nouveau " china , a Kitchen Aid mixer and a " Jack La Lanne power juicer . "
If you did n't want to pick out something yourself , the Huckabees were glad to take straight cash .
" Message from the couple , " the registry noted .
" Target GiftCards are welcome . "
Brantley suggests that a lot of this behavior stems from a Southern tradition of ponying up to the local preacher .
" If you 're the pastor of a church and you 've got a guy who owns a men 's clothing store , you expect the guy to give you a couple of new suits every year , " says Brantley .
" But Huckabee continued on like that as governor . "
Huckabee 's political record
One of his first acts as governor was to block Medicaid from funding an abortion for a mentally retarded teenager who had been raped by her stepfather -- an act in direct violation of federal law , which requires states to pay for abortions in cases of rape .
" The state did n't fund a single such abortion while Huckabee was governor , " says Dr. William Harrison of the Fayetteville Women 's Clinic .
" Zero . "
Huckabee 's well - documented disdain for science was reflected in the performance of the Arkansas school system when he was governor ; one independent survey gave the state an F for its science standards in schools , a grade that among other things reflected Huckabee 's hostility toward the teaching of evolution .
Quotes
" Science changes with every generation and with new discoveries , and God does n't , " he says .
" So I 'll stick with God if the two are in conflict . "
- Mike Huckabee
" If anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate , they are certainly welcome to do it . "

Microsoft is hard at work trying to battle the public and businesses ’ perception about Windows Vista .
They already published a whitepaper named “ Five Misunderstood Features in Windows Vista “ , detailing some of what they believe are misunderstandings .
Now , they also published a document wit five reasons to deploy Windows Vista – and why you should n’t wait for Windows 7 .
The five reasons are your usual marketing speak concerning Vista ; stability , security , productivity , mobility , and so on .
However , there ’s also an interesting chapter on Windows 7 .
The gist ?
Moving to Windows Vista now will ease the migration to Windows 7 once it ’s released .
There is no need to wait for Windows 7 .
It is a goal of the
Windows 7 release to minimize application compatibility for customers who have deployed Windows Vista since there was considerable kernel and device level innovation in Windows Vista .
The Windows 7 release is expected to have only minor changes in these areas .
Customers who are still using Windows XP when Windows 7 releases will have a similar application compatibility experience moving to Windows 7 as exists moving to Windows Vista from Windows XP .
Here we have Microsoft reiterating that Windows 7 will not contain any massive changes , and that it will build on top of the foundations laid by Windows Vista , improving them .
Interestingly , the recent rumours concerning Apple ’s next release seem to point at the same route : stabilisation and optimisation .
Assuming those rumours hold any water , we might be looking at some sort of truce between the two competitors .
Probably not meant as such , but interesting nonetheless , as it gives the rest of the market ( like Linux , BSD ) the time to catch up – or move ahead – on the desktop side of things .

A major medical row will erupt this month when scientists and health experts hold two key meetings to discuss the controversial subject of marriages between cousins and their impact on health in Britain .
The debates will be held by the Royal Society of Medicine as part of its 100 Years of Medical Genetics celebrations on 23 May , and by the Progress Educational Trust at Clifford Chance in east London on 29 May .
Both will reveal deep divisions among scientists .
Some researchers and politicians say inter-cousin unions , which are highly prevalent among British Pakistanis , have led to a striking rise in the incidence of rare recessive disorders , many of them fatal , in areas such as Bradford .
The trend has led to calls for cousin marriages to be banned .
' In our local school for deaf children , half the pupils are of Asian origin though Asians only form about 20 per cent of the population , ' said Ann Cryer , MP for Keighley .
' I also know of several sets of parents in my constituency who are cousins and whose children are severely disabled .
I have no doubt that the mothers and fathers being closely related to each is a key factor .
' We give warnings about the dangers of smoking , drinking and taking drugs .
It is now time that primary care trusts started doing the same for cousin marriages .
Others who have warned about the dangers include Phil Woolas , an environment minister , who provoked fury earlier this year when he said the culture of arranged marriages between first cousins was the ' elephant in the room ' and argued that if ' you have a child with your cousin , the likelihood is there will be a genetic problem ' .
This last claim is hotly disputed by genetic counsellors and Muslim doctors .
They point out that the danger of a child having birth defects if the parents are cousins is double that of other children , which means the risk rises from about 2 per cent in the general population to about 4 per cent when the parents are closely related .
A risk of 4 per cent therefore does not make it ' likely ' there will a genetic problem , as Woolas claimed , say genetic counsellors .
' The danger posed by cousin marriage is highly exaggerated , ' said Aamra Darr , a senior research fellow at Bradford University .
As Darr pointed out , women in Britain are more likely now to have children when they are over 30 , increasing the likelihood of them having babies with Down 's Syndrome .
But no one suggests that there should be a ban on over - 30s having babies , Darr added .
Medicine has adapted to improve screening services for these women .
' We should recognise that for British Pakistanis , cousin marriages represent significant cultural advantages .
Recent advances mean we can pinpoint many of those at risk of having affected babies .
That is where we should be placing our efforts . '
Meanwhile , as geneticist Alan Bittles of Murdoch University , Perth , has pointed out , a large majority of children born to first cousins are healthy : ' Many famous figures married their first cousin , including Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein . '
Telling Time with Ruby
Ask any Ruby developer what led them to embrace the language , and most will praise its " beauty , " comparing Ruby 's syntax to a eloquent poem or piece of art .
Admittedly , this sort of aggrandization used to elicit a sneer from yours truly , although at that point I 'd never actually looked into the language to determine what all of the fuss was about .
That is , until one day a single line of Ruby code caught my attention while surfing online :
7.days.ago
Made possible through the Active Support gem , when executed , this line of code will return the date and time occuring exactly seven days prior to its execution .
Today being Valentine 's day , executing this code now will return :
Thu Feb 14 11:10:26 -0500 2008
Although I 'm not yet prepared to place the language alongside the Picasso's and Chagall 's hanging in the Met , since encountering this mere line of code I 've been utterly hooked on the language .
But , this example is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Ruby 's intuitive date and time parsing and calculation capabilities .
In this tutorial , I 'll introduce you to some of the language 's temporal features , helping you to turn what is traditionally a frustrating aspect of programming into something that 's fun and productive .
An Exploration of Time
The best way to become familiar with Ruby 's time features is to fire up the interactive Ruby shell ( IRB ) and start experimenting .
To do so , open a terminal and execute irb .
Start simple and determine the current date and time , done with the DateTime class ' now method :
irb>DateTime.now =>
Thu , 14 Feb 2008 13:19:21 - 0500
You can take advantage of a number of methods to learn more about the current time and date :
irb>DateTime.now.year => 2008 irb>DateTime.now.month => 2 irb>DateTime.now.day => 14 irb>DateTime.now.hour => 09 irb>DateTime.now.min =>32 irb>DateTime.now.sec =>59
You also can use the DateTime class to learn more about a given date 's surroundings .
For instance , what will the date be four years from now , and what was it four years ago ?
irb>DateTime.now.years_since(4 ) =>
Tue , 14 Feb 2012 13:37:42 -0500 irb>DateTime.now.years_since(4 ) =>
Sat , 14 Feb 2004 13:37:42 - 0500
You also can use DateTime 's methods to calculate the beginning of the current month and beginning of the current quarter :
irb>DateTime.now.beginning_of_month.to_date =>
Fri , 01 Feb 2008 irb>DateTime.now.beginning_of_quarter.to_date =>
Tue , 01 Jan 2008
How about determining the current day of the week ?
You can use the strftime method to determine this and so much more .
strftime works similarly to PHP 's strftime ( ) function , accepting a time , bject , and formatting it according to a set of directives .
The list of directives is too long to list here , so refer to the previous link for a complete breakdown .
Returning to the objective , use strftime to learn more about today 's weekday :
irb>DateTime.now.strftime ( " %A " ) => Thursday
Remember the somewhat user - unfriendly string returned by Time.now ?
What if you wanted to recreate the current date / time in a friendlier form ?
You can use several of strftime 's directives to create whatever format you please :
irb>DateTime.now.strftime ( " %b %d , %Y " ) => " Feb 14 , 2008 " irb>DateTime.now.strftime ( " Today is %A , % I : %M%p " ) =>
" Today is Thursday , 12:21 PM " irb>DateTime.now.strftime ( " %Y - %m- %d " ) => " 2008 -02 - 14 "
Calculating the Number of Days Between Two Dates
The previous examples are all interesting , but programmers do n't always live in the here and now .
Often , they 're tasked with working with dates residing well into the future and the past .
For instance , what if you wanted to calculate the distance between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July ?
irb>memorial = DateTime.new(2008,05,31 ) =>
Sat , 31 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000 irb> fourth = DateTime.new(2008,07,04 ) =>
Fri , 04 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000 irb> days = ( fourth - memorial ) .to_i => 34
Never Be Late Again with Chronic
Ruby 's built - in time and date parsing and calculation capabilities are great , but some really interesting work has been done by the community to really enhance the ability to perform some powerful temporal calculations .
One of my favorite such projects is Chronic , a date / time parser that makes it possible to reference dates in a fascinating and natural fashion .
Install Chronic through Ruby 's gem system :
%> gem install chronic
Once installed , fire up irb again and retrieve the Chronic library :
require ' chronic '

Could the U.S. ultimately end up privatizing its entire mission in Iraq ?
That 's what the latest round of contracts the U.S. government plans to let out in the coming months might suggest .
As Walter Pincus reports in today 's Washington Post , the new contracts underscore the non-military involvement the U.S. is undertaking as public pressure mounts to reduce troop numbers
One contract could essentially begin to privatize the process of training the Iraqi security forces by hiring " mentors " to do what the U.S. military has struggled unsuccessfully to do for the past five years .
The proposals reflect multiyear commitments .
The mentor contract notes that the U.S. military " desires for both Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense to become mostly self - sufficient within two years , " a time outside some proposals for U.S. combat troop withdrawal .
...
The mentors will assist an U.S. military group that previously began to implement what are described as " core processes and systems , " such as procurement , contracting , force development , management and budgeting , and public affairs .
On the civilian side , the Bush administration is looking for a team of contractors to establish a system of security and protection for the Iraq judicial system :
The marshals service would be organized by the State Department 's bureau responsible for developing rule of law programs in Iraq .
It " has plans to create an Iraqi service to be known as the Judicial Protection Service ( JPS ) , modeled to some degree after the U.S. Marshals Service , that will ensure the safe conduct of judicial proceedings and protect judges , witnesses , court staff , and court facilities , " a notice published last month said .
With a circular logic , the contractors for the court police will be primarily charged with setting up a system that can be run by contractors for the long term :
In short , State wants a contractor to put together all the elements so the department can contract the project to another contractor .
Finally , the U.S. is seeking to privatize its own Iraqi prisons .
Another contract noticed last week previews the opening , apparently in September , of a U.S. - run prison , now labeled a Theater Internment Facility Reconciliation Center , which is to be located at Camp Taji , 12 miles north of Baghdad .
The new contract calls for providing food for " up to 5,000 detainees " and will also cover 150 Iraqi nationals , who apparently will work at the facility .
The contract is to run for one year , with an option year to follow .
These latest contract announcements come in addition to the massive amount of U.S. arms that the Pentagon has encouraged the Iraq military to buy .
So far , the Iraqi government -- which long relied on Russian - made military supplies -- has committed to buy about $ 3 billion in U.S. weapons , as USA Today reported recently :
The increase in Iraqi arms and equipment purchases has helped makers of such U.S. military staples as the Humvee , the Pentagon 's workhorse vehicle , and the M - 4 and M - 16 rifles , military contract records show .
That puts Iraq among the top current purchasers of U.S. military equipment through the foreign military sales program , records show .
Benkert said the deals are helping to cement the future relationship of Iraq to the United States .
Mr. Gates made clear that most troubling was that the inquiry showed how little the Air Force had done to improve the security of the nuclear weapons infrastructure even after it was disclosed last year that a B - 52 bomber had flown across the United States without anyone ’s realizing that it was carrying six armed nuclear cruise missiles .
Mr. Gates , whose military service includes a year as an intelligence officer within the Air Force ’s nuclear program , emphasized that neither incident posed a danger of a nuclear mishap .
Nevertheless , he said , the inquiry made it clear that the Air Force had suffered for years from a loss of expertise in handling nuclear materials .
He acknowledged that the Air Force had taken steps to improve the situation , but he said that more must be done to fix “ structural , procedural and cultural problems . ”
Mr. Gates , 64 , served as deputy national security adviser and director of central intelligence under the first President George Bush .
He has repeatedly said that he plans to retire from government service at the end of the Bush administration , but there has been speculation that he may be asked to stay on by either a President McCain or a President Obama after January , to help guide the Pentagon while the country is at war .
Pentagon officials said General Moseley , in his role as a member of the Joint Chiefs , met Thursday with Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman , who supported the decisions for both officials to retire .
The errors in handling nuclear weapons components constituted more than just an indication that the cold - war - era focus on these powerful weapons had become fuzzy .
They have also put the Bush administration in a difficult position , as the United States is struggling to prevent nuclear technology from spreading to nations that do not have it and has criticized North Korea and Iran for their nuclear ambitions .
American officials have even spoken strongly to Russia for not sufficiently safeguarding its stockpile .
Late , I know , and not much from me : I ’m just pointing you at these three posts below from Melissa McEwan at Shakesville .
Trauma - Trigger Alert : Melissa describes her own rape in harrowing detail in order to point out how rape is not funny , and although the discussion threads start out thoughtful and interesting , they end up invaded by shockjock fans who troll the thread with graphic threats of rape directed against Melissa and other commenters .
Are n’t we feminists lucky , we get some cyberbullying to go with the defense of rape jokes as well !
Melissa has decided not to delete them in order to show just what sort of threats these jerks perceive as “ jokes ” that we “ need to get a sense of humour ” about .
Rape Is Hilarious
Rape Is Hilarious Part II
Rape Is Not Only Hilarious ; It ’s No Big Deal
Update 4th Feb 2008 : Melissa has continued this series , here are the links to the collection thus far .
The first post above is Part Five in the list below , the third post above is Part Six , and Liss did n’t include the the second post above in the list below , which I copied from Shakesville today .
[ Rape is Hilarious : Parts One , Two , Three , Four , Five , Six , Seven , Eight , Nine , Ten , Eleven , Twelve , Thirteen , Fourteen , Fifteen , Sixteen , Seventeen , Eighteen . ]
Cyberbullying :
Kate Harding has a great post in response to the cyberbullying .
Let those folks read it who claim that men bloggers get flamed and threatened just as much and as creepily as women bloggers .
Suuurrrre they do .
As usual for Feminism Friday , feel free to leave a link to recent Feminism Friday posts from other blogs in comments – your own or others .
Tehran , June 27 , IRNA - Iran 's former president Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani advised the West on Friday to use an adequate literature and dialogue in dealing with a " big country " like Iran .
" You are too small to punish a big country like Iran .
We have repeatedly advised that using the literature ( of sanctions ) in dealing with Iran will not be in favor of the west , " said Ayatollah Rafsanjani in his second Friday prayers sermon , while referring to the EU 's sanctioning the Melli Bank of Iran in Europe , to the US government 's bill to exert more pressure on Tehran and to the G8's double - standard statement on Iran .
" With a great country like Iran , one should deal only with a proper literature , dialogue , logic and reason ; otherwise , you would put the region in trouble without gaining anything , " the Experts Assembly head warned .
He said the Islamic Republic of Iran wants nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes and is ready for dialogue to win global confidence .
" The West should stop following a wrong approach towards Iran , " he announced .
Elsewhere in his sermon , Rafsanjani touched on his " highly effective " presence in the Conference on Inter - Religious Dialogue in Saudi Arabia and said , " Had it not been for Iran 's presence , there would not have been any Islamic Unity . "
Ayatollah Rafsanjani said that some extremist Wahabi figures had protested Saudi King for the address delivered to the meeting by the Iranian party , while majority of ulima present there had welcomed Iran 's presence .
He then touched on " bloody and regretful " events in Palestine , Iraq and Afghanistan and said foreign presence has cost the region dearly .
On the World Day of Campaign against Drugs , the Expediency Council Chairman condemned drugs transit worldwide and referred to drugs as a " calamity " for mankind , especially Iran , hoping that Iranian youth will get rid of the illicit phenomenon .
He thanked all those involved in campaign against the dirty business .

Earlier , I detailed how John McCain , John Yoo and Justice Antonin Scalia in the wake of the Court 's Boumediene decision all continued to peddle the discredited Republican talking point about " 30 former Guantanamo detainees " who had " returned to the fight . "
Now a devastating new report released Tuesday from Seton Hall professor Mark Denbeaux puts to rest the Scalia 's " urban legend . "
That figure of 30 terror recidivists unleashing a bloodbath had been debunked by earlier studies from Denbeaux 's team and recent investigations from the McClatchy papers .
But Denbeaux 's updated analysis , including the revelations that the Defense Department itself backtracked from the infamous Gitmo 30 in July 2007 and May 2008 , shows the extent to which Justice Scalia engaged in cherry - picking dubious data to bolster his blood - curdling Boumediene dissent last week .
And it has n't stopped the exaggerated number of Gitmo repeat terrorists ( like the cry of " worse than Dred Scott " ) from becoming a standard Republican talking point since the Court 's restoration of habeas corpus last week .
Birth of a Sound Bite
The sound bite dates back to the summer of 2007 , when the Pentagon released its own study to counter an earlier analysis by Denbeaux which questioned the intelligence value of Al Qaeda and Taliban personnel held by the U.S.
The New York Times said " it paints a chilling portrait of the detainees , " and quoted Pentagon spokesman Jeffrey Gorden on one of its key findings :
" Our reports indicate that at least 30 former Guantanamo detainees have taken part in anti-coalition militant activities after leaving U.S. detention , " he said .
" Some have been killed in combat in Afghanistan and Pakistan . "
That figure quickly became a staple among Republicans in the debate over Guantanamo Bay and the status of the detainees in the wake of the Court 's Hamdan decision and the subsequent passage of the Military Commissions Act .
With the Senate Judiciary Committee now in Democratic hands , GOP Senators Kyl , Sessions , Graham , Cornyn , and Coburn prominently featured the 30 released detainees in their minority report arguing against the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 :
" At least 30 detainees who have been released from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility have since returned to waging war against the United States and its allies .
A dozen released detainees have been killed in battle by U.S. forces , while others have been recaptured . "
It is worth noting , as the Committee 's majority report did , that all detainees released from Guantanamo Bay were freed not by civilian courts , but by the military 's own tribunals and commissions :
" Indeed , those Guantanamo detainees who have been released since 9/11 -- discussed at length by critics of this legislation -- have been freed by the military following its own process , not by federal judges on habeas review . "
Conservatives Wave the Bloody Shirt
In his Boumediene dissent , Justice Scalia regurgitated the now - familiar talking point , citing the news accounts contained in the minority report of Kyl et al :
" In the short term , however , the decision is devastating .
At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to the battlefield .
See S. Rep. No. 110-90 , pt. 7 , p. 13 ( 2007 ) ( Minority Views of Sens. Kyl , Sessions , Graham , Cornyn , and Coburn ) ( hereinafter Minority Report ) ... ... These , mind you , were detainees whom the military had concluded were not enemy combatants .
Their return to the kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of assessing who is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign theater of operations where the environment does not lend itself to rigorous evidence collection . "
In his own tirade in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday , John Yoo in turn approvingly cited Scalia 's Boumediene dissent as proof of the coming bloodbath the Court 's majority has enabled :
" Just as there is always the chance of a mistaken detention , there is also the probability that we will release the wrong man .
As Justice Antonin Scalia 's dissenting opinion notes , at least 30 detainees released from Guantanamo Bay -- with the military , not the courts , making the call -- have returned to Afghanistan and Iraq battlefields . "
And in his own blistering attack on the Court 's ruling on Friday , John McCain picked up the torch , virtually ensuring that the Gitmo 30 will be a bludgeon used against Barack Obama through November :
" 30 of the people who have already been released from Guantanamo Bay have already tried to attack America again . "
A Claim Debunked
Of course , there seems to be one minor problem with the tale told by Mssrs Kyl , McCain , Scalia and Yoo .
Like much else that passes for Bush administration propaganda , it 's a wild exaggeration at best .
During a December 11 , 2007 appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Denbeaux presented an analysis of the same data to reach a starkly different conclusion .
The Seton Hall professor and detainee lawyer contended :
Just as the Government 's claims that the Guantanamo detainees " were picked up on the battlefield , fighting American forces , trying to kill American forces , " do not comport with the Department of Defense 's own data , neither do its claims that former detainees have " returned to the fight . "
The Department of Defense has publicly insisted that at least thirty ( 30 ) former Guantanamo detainees have " returned " to the battlefield , where they have been re-captured or killed .
To date , however , the Department has described at most fifteen ( 15 ) possible recidivists , and has identified only seven ( 7 ) of these individuals by name .
More strikingly , data provided by the Department of Defense reveals that : - at least eight ( 8 ) of the fifteen ( 15 ) individuals identified alleged by the Government to have " returned to the fight " are accused of nothing more than speaking critically of the Government 's detention policies ; - ten ( 10 ) of the individuals have neither been re-captured nor killed by anyone ; - and of the five ( 5 ) individuals who are alleged to have been re-captured or killed , two ( 2 ) of the individuals ' names do not appear on the list of individuals who have at any time been detained at Guantanamo , and the remaining three ( 3 ) include one ( 1 ) individual who was killed in an apartment complex in Russia by local authorities and one ( 1 ) who is not listed among former Guantanamo detainees but who , after his death , has been alleged to have been detained under a different name .
No doubt , Denbeaux 's role as a defense attorney for detainees held by the United States in Cuba means his analysis will ( and should ) draw extra scrutiny .
But in its devastating three - part probe into the American detainee system , McClatchy largely confirmed Denbeaux 's 2007 assessment :
A study published by a professor at the Seton Hall School of Law found that 45 percent of 516 Guantanamo detainees examined had committed hostile acts against the United States or its allies , and that only 8 percent of them had been al Qaida fighters .
The study drew on unclassified Department of Defense transcripts and documents from military tribunals at Guantanamo ... ... So who got it right ?
It 's not possible to say definitively .
However , a McClatchy investigation came to conclusions similar to the Seton Hall study , and West Point 's statistical breakdown , under close examination , helps explain how Guantanamo 's cellblocks became filled with innocents and low - level Taliban grunts .
Now , Denbeaux 's new report ( " Justice Scalia , the Department of Defense , and the Perpetuation of an Urban Legend " ) puts the final nail in the coffin for the right - wing 's Gitmo 30 fear - mongering .
The press release accompanying the June 17 study noted , " The ' 30 ' number , however , was corrected in a DoD press release issued in July 2007 , and a DoD document submitted to the House Foreign Relations Committee on May 20 , 2008 abandons the claim entirely . "
That House hearing occurred two weeks before Scalia published his stinging Boumediene dissent .
And Seton Hall 's findings , all available in the public domain , are more damning still :
- At most 12 , not 30 , detainees " returned to the fight . " -
Of these 12 , it is by no means clear that all are properly characterized as having been so engaged since their release .
- According to the Department of Defense 's published and unpublished data not a single detainee was ever released by a court .
Moreover , every released detainee was released by political appointees of the Department of Defense , sometimes over the objection of the military .
- According to the Department of Defense 's published and unpublished data and reports , not a single released Guantánamo detainee has ever attacked any Americans .
- The Department of Defense 's statements regarding recidivism are inconsistent with each other and often contradictory .
-
This may be because , despite the importance of detainee recidivism , the Department of Defense 's sources of information are media reports .
- Despite national security concerns , the Department of Defense does not have a system for tracking the conduct or even the whereabouts of released detainees .
There is no question that some number of those held at Guantanamo Bay are indeed the " worst of the worst , " as the trial of Khalid Sheikh Muhammed and associates makes clear ) .
( As McClatchy 's massive probe this past week shows , many more were not . )
And as the DoD , the 2007 Senate Judiciary Committee report , Denbeaux and some conservative bloggers rightly point out , a handful committed new terrorist atrocities in Iraq , Kuwait , Afghanistan and Russia after their release from U.S. custody in Cuba .
But John McCain and friends notwithstanding , the claim that " 30 of the people who have already been released from Guantanamo Bay have already tried to attack America again " is simply not true .
Of course , that does n't mean we 've heard the last of the Gitmo 30 .
A team of Dutch and German astronomers have discovered part of the missing matter in the Universe using the European X - ray satellite XMM - Newton .
They observed a filament of hot gas connecting two clusters of galaxies .
This tenuous hot gas could be part of the missing “ baryonic ” matter .
The existence of this hot gas ( with a temperature of 100 000 - 10 000 000 degrees ) , known as a warm - hot intergalactic medium , was predicted 10 years ago as a possible source for the missing dark matter .
Gas at such high temperature and low density is very difficult to detect and many attempts have failed in past years .
The team observed a pair of clusters of galaxies ( Abell 222 and Abell 223 ) using the European X - ray satellite XMM - Newton .
Their observations ( see Fig. 1 ) clearly show a bridge connecting both clusters .
The gas they observed there is probably the hottest and densest part of the diffuse gas in the cosmic web , which would be part of the missing “ baryonic ” dark matter .
Composite optical / X- ray image of two clusters of galaxies Abell 222 and Abell 223 .
The two clusters are connected by a filament of hot , low - density gas .
The optical image was obtained by SuprimeCam at the Subaru telescope , and the X - ray image showing the distribution of the diffuse hot gas ( yellow to red ) was obtained by XMM - Newton .
Image processing by Jörg Dietrich , Norbert Werner , and Alexis Finoguenov .
Most of the matter and energy in the Universe is of unknown nature , so they are called “ dark matter ” and “ dark energy ” .
Dark energy accounts for 72 % of the total energy in the Universe , while some 23 % of the total amount of matter / energy is made of this so - called “ dark matter ” , which is composed of heavy particles still waiting to be discovered by particle physicists .
The remaining 5 % of the Universe is made of ordinary matter , the one we know on Earth that constitutes stars and planets .
It consists of protons and neutrons – called baryons – and of electrons , all the building blocks of the atoms .
But part of this 5 % of “ baryonic ” matter is also missing .
Stars , galaxies , and gas that astronomers observed in the Universe account for less than half of the baryonic matter .
The newly - detected bridge connecting Abell 222 and Abell 223 would be part of this missing baryonic matter .
Matter in the Universe is distributed in a web - like structure , and clusters of galaxies are the dense nodes of this cosmic web [ 2 ] .
For 10 years , astronomers suspected that the missing baryonic matter is hot gas at very low density permeating the filamentary structure of the cosmic web .
Because of its low density , detecting this hot gas was a very challenging task .
This discovery was made possible because of the very fortunate geometry of the two clusters .
As seen from the Earth , the filament connecting the two clusters is aligned along our line - of - sight , so that the entire emission from the filament is concentrated in a small region of the sky , thereby making its detection possible .
Previous observations , at a lower sensitivity level , only allowed astronomers to detect the clusters and some groups of galaxies , the dense knots of the web .
The high - sensitivity level now achieved with in - depth XMM - Newton observations makes it possible to observe the connecting wires of the cosmic web .
This discovery is a step toward understanding the distribution of the matter within the large - scale structure of the Universe .
The team of astronomers includes N. Werner ( SRON , Netherlands ) , A. Finoguenov , A. Simionescu , H. Böhringer ( MPI , Germany ) , J. S. Kaastra ( SRON and Utrecht University , Netherlands ) , J. P. Dietrich ( ESO , Germany ) , J. Vink ( Utrecht University , Netherlands ) .

I was detained by the police today and accused of stealing .
I was also illegally detained against my will by several Wal * Mart employees preceding the detention by police .
My crime ?
Leaving Wal * Mart with four bags of sugar ( that I had just purchased ) without showing a receipt , because I was not given one by the Wal * Mart cashier .
I was threatened with being taken to jail , threatened with physical violence as I attempted to leave , and had to defend myself and my property while Wal * Mart security attempted to rip it from my hands , breaking my bags and causing one of my items to break open on the pavement .
After I was released ( having been completely innocent all along ) , I was lectured by the police officer and Wal * Mart manager about how next time I could make it easier on myself by just agreeing to give up my rights to their goons to begin with .
While the initial employee who detained me apologized , the others , including the Wal * Mart Manager , did not .
I was at the Germantown Wal * Mart to buy four bags of sugar because earlier in the day I had been at Butler ’s Orchard picking 10 pounds of strawberries to turn into delicious jam .
And to make delicious jam , you need lots of sugar .
I grabbed four bags and headed to the checkout , where I also decided I could use some refreshment .
I grabbed a Mountain Dew from the cooler , but the cashier had already processed my card for the four bags of sugar .
He apologized and rang up another transaction for the Mt. Dew .
At that point , he crumpled up my receipt for the four bags of sugar and handed me the receipt for the Mountain Dew .
I headed for the exit , and was greeted by Wal * Mart security who wanted to check my receipt .
I produced the receipt for the Mountain Dew and explained that the cashier had tossed the other receipt for the sugar .
I would repeat this explanation 6 more times before this affair ended .
The rest of the tale is below …
At this point , I attempted to leave , but was told I could not .
I immediately asked if I was being detained .
I was told “ no ” but that I was n’t allowed to leave unless I walked back to the cashier to get a receipt .
I said that I was “ happy to let the security guard talk to the cashier , but that I was heading home with my sugar . ”
I attempted to leave again , and the door was blocked .
I asked again if I was being detained , and was told “ yes . ” I asked on what grounds , and the security guard said “ Because you stole . ”
I informed the guard I had done no such thing , that the sugar was my property , and I was leaving with it .
This time I pushed passed him and left the store , with him following me demanding I stop .
As I left , he grabbed my bags , ripping them open .
As he followed me he attempted to grab my bags , and grab the items inside of my bags .
At one point , he told me that he should “ kick my ass . ”
As I reached the end of sidewalk outside the store and headed towards my car in the parking lot , another employee came running and blocked my path .
Soon afterwards a manager arrived .
I again asked if I was being detained .
I was informed by the manager that I was .
I again asked for what reason , and was told by the original security guard that it was for stealing .
I once again informed them that I had n’t stolen anything and that I was leaving .
At this point , the manager informed me that Wal * Mart policy did not allow me to leave the store without showing a receipt .
I said that I had paid for my merchandise , that it was in fact a store employee that had thrown away my receipt , and that I was not compelled to prove that items that I legally owned belonged to anyone but me .
Again I inquired whether I was being detained , and was told my only options were to go back in the store to talk to the cashier or have the police called .
I informed the manager that she was welcome to call the police , because I had done nothing wrong .
At tht point , she radioed for someone to call the police .
Once again , I started to walk to my car as the two security guards again attempted to block my path in the parking lot .
At this point , and off duty police officer came to the scene ( he appeared to be heading into Wal * Mart to shop , not the one called by the manager ) , showed his badge , and asked for an explanation .
Everyone was calmed by this , and tensions visibly eased on the faces of the Wal * Mart employees .
I explained my side , and Wal * Mart employees explained their side .
After the explanations , I asked the police officer if I was being detained , and he said yes .
I asked on what grounds , and he said “ suspicion of theft . ”
The officer told me I could give them “ their merchandise back ” and leave at that point or I could go inside and talk to the cashier .
I indicated that since he was detaining me , I was willing to go back into the store and speak with the cashier , but that the merchandise belonged to me .
At this point , one of the bags of sugar fell from my ripped bags and split open on the pavement .
It was an accident , but I could tell no one believed me when I said so .
On the way into the store , the officer informed me that it was his day off , he had important things to do , and he did n’t want to take me to jail .
But I had one last chance to give them their merchandise back and just leave , because if I was n’t telling the truth , he would personally drive me to the station .
I agreed wholeheartedly with him , and told him so .
I ’m fairly certain he thought I had actually stolen the sugar at this point .
He then asked what I needed so much sugar for anyway .
At the time , I was literally covered with strawberry juice .
It had stained my shorts and shirt red , and I thought it was fairly believable that I was going to make strawberry jam .
He still seemed skeptical , asking where I had been picking strawberries , and only seemed to believe me after I was able to name Butler ’s Orchard .
He then asked if I had ID , what my name was , and how old I was .
Upon telling him this , he said “ You better not be lying to me , ” so perhaps I was too quick to think he did n’t assume I was guilty .
Of course , upon re-entering the store and speaking with the cashier , he informed everyone that I had paid for the sugar and the receipt was found in his trash can .
His story differed slightly in that he told them he had given me the receipt but I had thrown it into his trash can .
That was impossible based on where his trash can was from the checkout counter , but it did n’t matter .
The original security guard was cordial , shook my hand , and apologized .
The Wal * Mart manager and police officer lectured about how next time if I just cooperated and gave up my rights at the beginning , it would have been much easier on everyone .
Trust me , Wal * Mart , there wo n’t be a next time .
Despite his parents ' treatment , Lorenzo did not get better Lorenzo Odone , whose parents ' battle to save him from a rare nerve disorder was depicted in the 1992 film Lorenzo 's Oil , has died from pneumonia aged 30 .
Doctors had predicted he would not live beyond childhood when he was diagnosed with the incurable disease aged six .
But his parents found what seemed to be a cure made of acids from olive and rapeseed oils .
Lorenzo died at his home in the US state of Virginia on Friday - a day after his 30th birthday .
He was suffering from aspiration pneumonia , which was caused by food getting stuck in his lungs .
His father Augusto said : " He could not see or communicate , but he was still with us .
He did not suffer ...
That 's the important thing . "
Preventative treatment Lorenzo had Adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) , a genetic disease that progressively destroys the brains of young boys .
The disease leads to the build up of dangerous fatty acids - long - chain fatty acids - in the blood , and within a year children are paralysed , blind , and unable to speak .
It is invariably fatal .
Lorenzo was given less than two years to live but his parents refused to accept the doctors ' prognosis .
With no scientific training , they took on the medical establishment and set about finding a cure .
In 1986 it seemed they had succeeded with a combination of oils that effectively reduced the long - chain fatty acids in the blood .
Despite the fairytale ending in the film , the claims have always been controversial and children suffering from ALD continued to die , despite being treated with Lorenzo 's oil .
However , a 10 - year study showed that while the oil does not appear to work for people who are already ill , it does seem to prevent illness in those whose genes make them vulnerable to developing symptoms .
Augusto
Odone said his son's ashes would be taken to New York and placed with those of his wife Michaela , who died in 2000 .
He added that he was planning to move back to his native Italy and write a book about his son .
Actors Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte played Augusto and Michaela in the 1992 film .
Lorenzo was played by Zack O'Malley Greenburg .

Pokémon
Go fans can enjoy until the 2nd of November the Halloween event which brings Gen 3 rare Pokémon creatures and more .
Apart from the Halloween Pokémon creatures , trainers can get their hands on a Shiny Pokémon .
It is very hard to find , but during the already began Pokémon Go Halloween event , a trick of finding the creature has been revealed .
Find a Shiny
The trick to catch such a rare Pokémon was discovered accidentally , as part of a glitch found during Raid Battles .
It is a complicated system and only real fans will have the patience of completing it .
The method can get you Magikarp , the Shiny - capable Pokémon in Raids .
It was published by Pokémon Go players , users “ painfulplumber ” and “ DH025 ” .
Sadly , it only works for Magikarp , but Pikachu is known to pop up during special events .
It is unknown however if the later is Shiny - capable .
The trick might work for future Pokémon creatures as well , but it is not a given .
Niantic might try and find a way of fixing this system glitch soon enough .
Not all Shiny Pokémon appear
Shiny while being caught and they do not appear Shiny on the walking map .
It is also important for trainers to know that not all Shiny Pokémon appear Shiny after being caught and sometimes they bare no indicator .
To verify a Pokémon caught if it is shiny or not , the trainer must attempt of transfer it .
A message asking the player if he / she is sure about transferring the Shiny Pokémon will appear .
The method
To get their hands on a Shiny Pokémon , a trainer has to begin a Raid with 10 people , get the boss almost killed , get 9 people to close the app ( the player must remain ) .
Then he / she needs to go to the catch screen and crash it .
When reloading , the remaining trainer will see the CP of Pokémon .
If the privileged number is Good then they have 1/9 change of having the good CP .

Newswise —
There has been considerable interest in the publication of the platypus genome but it has led to a lot of confusion and some misconceptions about evolutionary relationships .
Platypus Sex Chromosomes And Basal - Equals - Primitive by Ryan Gregory .
PhD
While most mammals show an XY system ( males XY , females XX ) , the monotreme system is quite unique ( 5X5Y males , 5X5X females ) , and has some similarities to birds in terms of which genes are involved in determining sex ( 1 ) .
Thus , because monotremes have a system quite different from therians ( placental and marsupial mammals ) and the split between monotremes and therians occurred earlier than that between placentals and marsupials , the system in therians must have evolved after the split between theirs and the monotreme lineage .
Also , one can identify regions on platypus autosomes that correspond to the sex chromosomes in other mammals , suggesting that the therian sex determining genes are derived from former autosomal regions ( this was already apparent through comparisons with other non-mammalian vertebrates ) .
The problem is the way this has been framed .
The platypus is a modern species .
Like all modern species , it retains some ancestral characters ( e.g. , egg - laying and milk secretion without nipples ) , posseses many highly derived characters ( e.g. , electroreception and venom ) , and shows convergent evolution with some other groups ( e.g. , " duck bill " ) .
It is entirely possible that the chromosomal system in platypus is similar to the one found in the common mammalian ancestor , but to assume that because this species is " basal " ( i.e. , " early branching " ) it must be primitive in terms of any particular characteristic is a fallacy .
What The Platypus Genome Is and Is n't by Michael White , PhD
Is the platypus part bird , part reptile part mammal , an amalgam of very different groups of animals ?
Is it a primitive mammal that resembles the early ancestors of all mammals ?
Can we figure out just what this creature is by gazing at its genome ?
The platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus is part of a group of mammals known as Monotremes , who last shared a common ancestor with us between 160 and 200 million years ago ( 2 ) .
At that point , one mammalian line split off to give rise to today 's monotremes , while another eventually led to the marsupial and placental mammals .
What this means , of course , is that the platypus is as distant from that ancient ancestor as we are - humans , kangaroos , and platypuses are all modern mammals .
However some traits of the platypus can be considered primitive , if you take primitive to mean ' resembles the ancestral form ' ( instead of the more colloquial meaning ' less advanced ' ) .
The most obvious example is that the platypus lays eggs , something which ancient mammals also did , but which most modern mammals no longer do .
Egg - laying is an ancestral trait that has persisted in this particular evolutionary line , a trait which the platypus inherited from the egg - laying , reptile - like ancestors of all mammals - in that sense , it 's primitive .
Other features of the platypus are n't primitive , and have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that all mammals shared a common ancestor with today 's birds and reptiles .
The venomous spines possessed by the male platypus are not there because of some reptile ancestor that had venomous spines ; early mammals probably had no venom , and evolutionary biologists have long insisted that this interesting platypus feature is likely an independent evolutionary invention .
Venomous spurs are no more reptilian than the human lack of fur : we do n't have fur , and our reptile ancestors did n't have fur , but our bare skin is not a trait inherited from fur - less reptile - like ancestors , it 's a trait we lost recently in our evolutionary history .

Colbert : ' Mustaches do n't make you gay , but they do n't help '
Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert , adopting his faux - outraged - conservative schtick , was aghast during a recent interview with a Republican congressman who observed that gays and lesbians " are not out to destroy marriage . "
" If they 're not out to destroy marriage , then what are they out to destroy ? "
Colbert asked Rep. Bob Inglis , a Republican from Colbert 's home state of South Carolina .
" They 've already claimed mustaches and short - shorts ; they 've ruined those for the rest of us . "
Inglis was skeptical about the mustache claim .
" Oh yeah .
Look at some of the congressmen who has mustaches , look at how they vote , " Colbert said , displayed some previous mustachioed guests of his " Better Know a District " segments .
" [ It 's ] a statistical correlation , it 's not cause and effect , " Colbert said .
" Mustaches do n't make you gay , but they do n't help . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's Colbert Report , broadcast on January 30 , 2008

Rick Davis ' lobbyists ties certainly extend far beyond the telecom industry .
ABC News :
John McCain 's presidential campaign is blasting a New York Times report suggesting that the candidate may have known since 2005 that his campaign manager 's firm worked for a Kremlin - backed politician .
The McCain campaign is strongly denying the paper 's reporting that in 2005 , a White House National Security Council staffer called John McCain 's Senate office to complain that Rick Davis ' lobbying firm was " undercutting American policy on Ukraine " by representing a Kremlin - backed politician .
The Bush White House -- and McCain opposed Yanukovich , whom the United States and others had accused of election fraud , and benefiting from violence and intimidation towards journalists .
McCain 's campaign categorically denied that Davis was involved in his firm's work for the Ukranian politician did not prepare briefings for U.S. officials or lawmakers , did not schedule meetings involving Yanukovich , did not draft talking points , and did not make phone calls on Yanukovich 's behalf . [..]
If the account of the NSC staffer 's call is true , it suggests McCain should have known about the work by Davis ' business -- but installed him as campaign manager anyway .
McCain 's campaign , which had earlier referred a New York Times reporter to McCain 's Senate office , now disputes that such a phone call ever happened .[..]
The story also raises the possibility that Davis ' firm may have violated the anti-espionage Foreign Agents Registration Act , by failing to register work for Yanukovich with the U.S. government .
According to Salon , this is not the only campaign personnel with Russian ties :
IN LOS FELIZ , across from a 7 - Eleven on North Vermont Avenue , a few dozen men in their early 20s to late 80s share a dinner behind closed doors .
Some wear full tuxedos with bow ties and jeweled cuff links , some have shoulder - length hair , and others wear open - collared shirts that reveal the slightest filigree of tattoo arching across their chests .
Over Italian food , retired lawyers and judges sit elbow - to - elbow with owners of scrap metal yards and vintage clothing boutiques .
They hold forth on philosophy , the weather ; they rib each other and joke about saving room for cannoli .
As they reach for seconds , they reveal skull - cracking rings emblazoned with a compass and a square .
Meet the millennial Masons .
As secret societies go , it is one of the oldest and most famous .
Its enrollment roster includes Louis Armstrong and Gerald Ford , and it has been depicted in movies such as “ The Da Vinci Code ” and “ National Treasure . ”
Once more than 4 million strong ( back in the 1950s ) , it has been in something of a popularity free - fall ever since .
Viewed with suspicion as a bastion of antiquated values and forced camaraderie , the Masons have seen membership rolls plummet more than 60 % to just 1.5 million in 2006 .
Only now the trend seems to be reversing itself , and nowhere more noticeably than in Southern California .
The reasons seem clear .
In another Masonic Hall , this one on La Cienega , a Sri Lankan - born banker , a sunglasses - wearing Russian immigrant and a continent - hopping Frenchman break bread , poke at their salads and chat about their health .

“ For a time it looked as if Masonry was going into a sharp decline , if not the death throes , ” said UCLA history professor Margaret C. Jacob , who has written extensively about the fraternal order .
“ But it looks like it may be making a comeback . ”
That ’s because the Freemasons , whose tenets forbid soliciting or recruiting members , have enthusiastically embraced the Internet as a way to leverage curiosity about an organization with its roots in Europe ’s medieval stonemasons guilds .
Freemasonry today sees itself as a thinking man ’s salon , a learned society with a philanthropic bent .
“ We had a record number of new members last year , ” said Allan Casalou , grand secretary of the Grand Lodge of California .
“ We added 2,000 men , which is the most since 1998 and our seventh straight year of membership increases . ”
And , to paraphrase that Oldsmobile campaign , these definitely are n’t your father ’s Freemasons .
They are bar owners , male models and olive - oil brokers .
They are men like Zulu , an L.A. tattoo artist with a swirling Maori - inspired design inked across his face and a panoply of metal piercing his ears , nose and face .
They are men like Jonathan Kanarek , who runs a men ’s vintage clothing store on Hollywood Boulevard and whose retro chic wardrobe of polka - dot ascots , glen - plaid jackets and smartly pressed pocket squares earned him a spot on Esquire magazine ’s 2007 list of best - dressed real men in America .
And they are men like Daemon Hillin , whose surfer - dude looks and blinding white smile can be found on Japanese TV , where he plays sidekick and comic foil to the Japanese version of the Hilton sisters .

They are also all men who want to be part of an all - for - one and one - for - all brotherhood built on shared ideals , philosophical pursuits and a penchant for rings , aprons and funny hats .
As Zulu bluntly put it : “ I joined because I was looking for people to hang with that were like - minded but also hip and cool , and a lot of tattoo artists tend to be drunks and druggies . ”
Hillin , who originally joined the Masons in Temecula , moved to L.A. and is interested in the Santa Monica - Palisades Lodge No. 307 , one of the youngest and most diverse congregations in the state ( the average age of active brothers is just 33 ) .
The lodge ’s senior deacon , Jim Warren , calls it “ ‘ Star Trek ’ without the chicks . ”
“ We have every possible national origin , ethnicity and religious denomination you could imagine , ” he said .
Warren credits the Internet .
“ We were one the first lodges in the state to have a website up , ” he said .
“ That led to a huge spike in membership . ”
Other lodges followed suit , putting up their own sites and drawing a crowd .
That ’s how prospective Mason Johnny Royal ended up at the door of Elysian Lodge No. 418 last month .
Intrigued by the distinctive Masonic architecture that graces most halls , the 31 - year - old publicist with sideburns to his chin and hair to his shoulders and a Renaissance lute player tattoo on his right forearm hit the Web .

What he read about the Masonic ideals -- wisdom , strength , beauty and the pursuit of knowledge -- made him decide to pursue membership .
“ My generation wants to be part of something beyond itself , ” Royal said .
“ I want to learn ; I want to participate . ”
The Web generation
The INTERNET has n’t only made it easier to learn about the Freemasons , Casalou says , it ’s changed the type of men coming forward .
“ There is so much information on the Internet that by the time someone comes to a lodge to seek membership , they already know a lot about Masonry , ” he said .
“ Which is a big departure from previous generations .
And it means they are more likely to be active participants . ”
Zulu became curious about Freemasonry after tattooing Masonic symbology on several clients .
He joined five years ago at age 39 and now serves as webmaster and senior warden of North Hollywood Lodge No. 542 .
He has also gone on to become both a Scottish Rite Mason and Shriner ( Masonic membership is a prerequisite for both ) , and next year he will become the leader of his lodge .
“ I ’ll be the first black worshipful master in the lodge ’s history , ” he said , using the proper term of respect .

But he probably wo n’t be the last .
Because California ’s contingent of Freemasons is expected to grow , the average age of its members , once 71 and now 65 , is expected to drop .
By 2018 , as Casalou predicts , the state will be awash in 55 - year - old pre-retirement Masons giving each other secret handshakes , wearing ritual aprons and invoking the Grand Architect of the Universe .
The Internet continues to help .
Zulu said that he gets at least four e-mails a week from prospective Masons around the globe who see his tattooed and pierced visage at the lodge website and want to be reassured such an alternative look is n’t a barrier to membership .
“ Yeah , I think it ’s going to become hip and chic to be a Mason , ” Zulu said .
“ And that could be a dangerous thing . ”

Over the past seven years I have read many articles that just make my blood boil .
The other day was just such as an example with a seemingly innocent article from the AP , innocent , that is , until one starts piecing things together .
Because I can recall other matters related to the issue , the very first sentence made my hands shake in fury .
With blithe naiveté the article began , " Washington - Iraqi leaders have been given the latest US evidence of Iranian support for militias inside Iraq , and Baghdad will decide what to do about it , two senior Pentagon officials said Wednesday . "
Baghdad will decide whether the U.S. will attack Iran or not ?
That is what it says , and that is totally disingenuous .
Background will follow .
With quivering fingers and flaring nostrils , I read on .
" Marine Lt. Gen. John Sattler , director of strategy , plans and policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki possesses the evidence , which other officials said contradicts Tehran 's stated commitment to stop providing arms , weapons technology and training to Shiite militias inside Iraq . "
Gen .
Sattler added , " It 's in Prime Minister al - Maliki 's hands right now ... "
About ready to kill someone at this point , I continued to read to my everlasting regret , noting that the AP was merely reporting what it heard .
The general added , " The evidence inside Baghdad has been shared with the Iraqi leadership , and that 's where it stands right now . "
That 's absolutely wonderful .
The Iraqi PM has the evidence .
I blew .
What are the American people ?
Fish bait ?
It gets worse .
Enter CIA Director Michael Hayden , stage right .
He states , " It is my opinion , it is the policy of the Iranian government , approved to highest level of that government , to facilitate the killing of Americans in Iraq . "
So here we have the DCI stating that the " Iranian government " is killing Americans , and Americans are not allowed to see the evidence , but the weak and ineffectual Iraqi government can .
Also , this contradicts the JCS chairman , Adm . Michael Mullen , who recently stated , " ... he has ' no smoking gun which could prove that the highest leadership [ of Iran ] is involved in this . "
We were allowed to see a mere glimpse at the proof through the usual official - who - spoke - on - the - condition - of - anonymity - because - the - evidence - was - not - public - yet source .
At least I hope it was a mere glimpse because he disclosed absolutely nothing of import .
Weapons of Iranian origin were found in Iraq with recent code dates .
Well , gee and golly .
Imagine that .
Iranian weapons were found in Iraq .
General , Sir , allow me to clue you in .
The Mideast is a hotbed for arms merchants .
Without even looking hard one could find weapons of Russian , Egyptian , Israeli , Polish , German , Swedish , even American origin .
If one has the bread , one could easily buy a tank .
Are you angry yet ?
I have n't even gotten started .
For over two years now Americans have been besieged by the eminent attack on Iran , a truly disastrous and abysmal strategy .
Recently , in a speech at West Point , Gates said Iran " is hell - bent on acquiring nuclear weapons . "
That is pure conjecture , and flies in the face of the December NIE that stated with confidence that Iran had given up its nuclear weapons aspirations four years ago .
Smart move on the part of Iran .
Working to perfect one nuclear device while Israel has a hundred or more would be infinitely stupid and would n't happen in the first place .
In the small pond known as the Mideast Israel is at the top of the food chain , and the Mossad is more than capable .
More than two years ago , Seymour Hersh disclosed in the New Yorker how George W. Bush was considering strategic nuclear strikes against Iran .
Ever since , a campaign to demonize that country has proceeded in a relentless , neocon - like way , applying the same techniques and semantic contortions that were so familiar in the period before the Bush administration launched its invasion of Iraq .
However , Americans say today , " Fool me once , shame on you .
Fool me twice , shame on me . "
Americans will not be fooled ... not again .
In early December , Marine captain [ ret. ] , author , and columnist Scott Ritter predicted that the U.S. would attack Iran in April .
Well , of course , that did not happen , but the article was written prior to the widely - publicized Dec. NIE mentioned above .
That NIE took the wind out of the Bush / Cheney sails .
However , they are now restarting the same old routine assuming Americans have forgotten that bothersome NIE .
Americans have not forgotten .
Another pundit predicted war with Iran in May .
Still another before " summer 's end . "
There are scores of such articles .
All these writers are basing their beliefs on what is appearing before their eyes .
What they see is a change in tactics .
President Bush , Vice - President Cheney , JCS chairman Adm. Mullen , SecState Gates , DCI Hayden , Iraqi commander Gen. Petraeus , and others are all saying the same thing .
Iran is training and equipping forces in Iraq that are killing American soldiers .
Some , like Gates , are returning to the original gambit - Iran " is hell - bent on acquiring nuclear weapons .
In March , Vice - President Cheney had the occasion to visit our friends in Saudi Arabia .
Soon after he left , the Saudi newspaper , Okaz , with the blessings of the Saudi government put out a red alert for Saudis to make preparations for a nuclear fallout from Iran .
Some experts claim the Bush Administration is on the brink of launching an attack against Iran ’s Bushehr nuclear reactors and is warning neighboring allies .
Earlier , on March 11 , CENTCOM commander , Adm. William Fallon , was sacked .
For those unaware of the chain of command , Adm. Fallon was Gen. Petraeus ' boss .
Fallon had declared months ago that an attack on Iran would not occur during his watch .
His early retirement fueled speculation that Bush / Cheney were preparing for such an attack .
Only recently , Adm . Mullen stated , " ... that the Pentagon is planning for ' potential military courses of action ' against Iran ... "
He added , " It would be a mistake to think that we are out of combat capability . "
This aged former intelligence officer would like to remind the good admiral that contingency plans are not meant for public consumption , and respectfully , Sir , it is suggested that you keep your mouth shut about them .
Mullen states that he prefers a diplomatic solution .
Wonderful .
Do n't we all .
He also reported that Gen. Petraeus is preparing a briefing soon to lay out detailed evidence of increased Iranian involvement in Iraq .
While Americans are soaking in all of this , pray tell , what are we supposed to believe ?
While America 's leadership is ratcheting up the rhetoric about how Iran is killing Americans , President Ahmadinejad has a different point of view .
He blames the Bush administration and the American occupation force of 160,000 troops as the reason for the fighting and dying in Iraq .
From a purely unbiased viewpoint , there is something to be said for that argument .
In addition , the U.S. has this huge occupation force on the doorstep of Iran , and Bush and Co. are arguing it is all Iran 's fault for the repercussions of said force .
The unbiased reader is asked , does that make any sense ?
Sayyed Hassan al - Qazwini , imam of the largest mosque in North America in Detroit is one frustrated Muslim .
" When I speak , or other moderate Muslim scholars speak , we will not find any outlet for our words , " he says .
" But if a grocer in Karachi goes out on the streets and calls for jihad [ holy war ] against America , he will find many media outlets there ready to cover his insanity . "
History is on the side of the imam .
" Sunnis and Shiites , after all , have learned to ' grudgingly ' tolerate each other for centuries , despite doctrinal differences , " says Hisham Hellyer of the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies and an adviser to the British government on Islamic extremism . "
Juan Cole , a professor of history at the University of Michigan , adds , " The distinctions between Sunnis and Shiites simply were not an issue during the height of Arab nationalism in the 1950s and 1960s . "
In other words , it was kind of like Catholics and Protestants in the U.S.
We do n't kill each other .
Personally , there are even some liberals I like , noting that has little to do with religion .
While Shiite and Sunni - dominated countries have fought each other in the past - such as the Sunni Ottoman Empire and the Shiite Safavid dynasty of Persia and more recently the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq
War , those conflicts were not motivated by disputes over religious interpretation .
" They were about power and politics , " Mr. Hellyer says .
Besides , the Turks are Turks , not Arabs , and , as mentioned above , the Iranians ( Persia ) are not Arabs either .
I just want to keep the ethnicity straight , because Americans have a tendency to group all Mideast states under one umbrella , Arab Muslims .
When and where did sectarian warfare break out ?
When did Sunnis and Shiites begin bombing their respective mosques , killing each other on the streets , attacking mourners at funerals , and ravaging religious festivals ?
And when did rival factions within the Sunni and Shia begin to attack each other ?
If one has been listening , it does n't take a rocket scientist to answer the question .
Sectarian warfare broke out in Iraq soon after the American invasion of that sovereign nation .
That , folks , is an indisputable historical fact .
And , yet , Bush and Co. have the sheer audacity to blame Iran for the travails in Iraq today .
That is not propaganda .
That is mindboggling disinformation to the American people reminiscent of a Nazi era 75 years ago .
What if the Bush administration has the criminal effrontery to attack Iran , what will be the Iranian response ?
Will they passively accept it and go before the U.N. Security Council demanding condemnation of the United States ?
This is doubtful .
The Iranian people , particular the young , the under 40 - somethings , are very much like Americans , very in - tune to the modern world , very intuitive , technologically advanced that would put this writer to shame , and very Westernized .
They actually like Americans , but loath the American government .
They also share the Western virtue of revenge against an outrage .
Will the Iranians attack Israel , bringing them into the conflict ?
The ayatollahs are not that stupid .
Iran will react by attacking juicy targets , American units just across a convenient border in Iraq .
It should be mentioned that Iran is three times the size of Iraq .
Due to our stressed - out troops and dangerously long supply lines , I can't imagine a worst scenario .
How will Bush react to Iran escalating the conflict by attacking American camps , bases and embassy in Iraq .
I do n't even want to go there .
It is too horrible to contemplate , other than to say Bush may get his rapture , and the Second Holocaust may commence with the Mideast literally blowing up while American forces are right the thick of it , surrounded and in peril .
So , there you have it .
Should Americans be concerned ?
The American who is n't is brain - dead .
This time , before the U.S. attacks , we want unimpeachable proof that it is necessary , and the mere presence of Iranian weapons is less than pathetic as evidence .
Even if there is proof the Grand Ayatollah is instrumental in American troop deaths , given the circumstances , perhaps we should consider other alternatives , rather than military ones .
But that is not up to us .
According to the highest circles in our government , the evidence of Iranian misbehavior is being presented to Iraqis , not Americans , and " Baghdad will decide what to do about it . "
Are you angry yet ?
Police officers form lines outside a meeting of Nepal 's new constitutent assembly which voted Wednesday to end the country 's 239 year old monarchy .
( Saurabh Das / ASSOCIATED
PRESS )
Lawmakers in Nepal voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to abolish the country 's 239 - year - old monarchy , turning the world 's only Hindu kingdom into its newest republic .
Members of the country 's newly elected constituent assembly cast their votes inside a converted convention centre in the ancient Nepalese capital , Kathmandu , as thousands of people celebrated in the streets outside .
The decision came much later in the day than scheduled because of last - minute procedural wrangling by political leaders .
When word of the vote reached the crowds , people cheered and chanted " Long live republic . "
The government declared a two - day national holiday .
At one point in the evening , as assembly members filed into the building , there were two small bomb explosions blamed by police on militant monarchy supporters .
Several people were injured .
Supporters of the assembly 's largest political party , a former Maoist rebel group , waved red flags with the communist hammer and sickle symbol .
Banners and signs welcomed the new republic and denounced the outgoing king , Gyanendra Bikram Shah , whose family has ruled Nepal since 1769 .
Gyanendra assumed the throne in 2001 when most of his close family were massacred at a family dinner by the heir to the throne at the time , prince Dipendra .
An official inquiry said Dipendra had been drunk , high on drugs and furious at his parents , the king and queen , for refusing to allow him to marry the woman of his choice .
Royal coup in 2005
Despite his status as just a constitutional monarch , Gyanendra dismissed an elected government in 2002 and took direct power himself three years later in an attempt to put down the Maoist rebellion , which claimed some 13,000 lives in 10 years of fighting .
But the king was forced to hand back power in April 2006 , jump - starting a peace process that saw the rebels become a legal political party , elections to the new assembly earlier this year and Wednesday 's abolition of the monarchy .
Gyanendra has given no indication how he intended to respond to the end of the monarchy , and the country 's leading politicians have in recent days threatened to remove him from the 1970s - era concrete palace by force if he refuses to go peacefully .
But in an apparent bid to defuse any potential standoff , the country 's newly elected assembly will give the outgoing king 15 days to vacate his palace , political leaders said .
There was no immediate reaction from the palace , which has rarely commented on political developments in Nepal since Gyanendra was forced to end his royal dictatorship and restore democracy two years ago .
It 's reported in the Nepali media that he will now become an ordinary citizen of Nepal and despite losing his seven palaces and multimillion - dollar annual allowance , is still one of the country 's richest men .
But getting rid of the Shah dynasty is in many ways the least of the new government 's problems .
Nepal is still plagued by political unrest and frequent outbreaks of violence .
There were at least seven bomb attacks in the days before the assembly made its historic decision .
Analysts said the new assembly will be hard pressed to put years of conflict behind the major parties and take concrete steps for economic and political development .
Despite being close to Asia 's two largest and fastest - growing countries , India and China , Nepal is one of the world 's poorest nations , with most of its 29 million people living on less than a dollar a day .
It has few known natural resources and even its abundant hydro power potential from the Himalayan mountain rivers that criss - cross the landscape has yet to be widely exploited .
When Charles Darwin introduced the theory of evolution through natural selection 158 years ago , the scientists of the day argued over it fiercely , but the massing evidence from paleontology , genetics , zoology , molecular biology and other fields gradually established evolution 's truth beyond reasonable doubt .
Today that battle has been won everywhere — except in the public imagination .
Embarrassingly , in the 21st century , in the most scientifically advanced nation the world has ever known , creationists can still persuade politicians , judges and ordinary citizens that evolution is a flawed , poorly supported fantasy .
They lobby for creationist ideas such as “ intelligent design ” to be taught as alternatives to evolution in science classrooms .
When this article first went to press in 2002 , the Ohio Board of Education was debating whether to mandate such a change .
Prominent antievolutionists of the day , such as Philip E. Johnson , a law professor at the University of California , Berkeley , and author of Darwin on Trial , admitted that they intended for intelligent - design theory to serve as a “ wedge ” for reopening science classrooms to discussions of God .
The good news is that in 2005 the landmark legal case Kitzmiller v. Dover in Harrisburg , Pa. , set binding precedent that the teaching of intelligent design in U.S. public schools is unconstitutional because the idea is fundamentally religious , not scientific .
The bad news is that in response , creationists have reinvented their movement and pressed on .
When they lost the ability to claim that creationist ideas are valid science , they switched to arguing that they were only supporting “ academic freedom . ”
Worse , to further obscure the religious roots of their resistance , they now push for “ critical analysis ” of climate change , cloning research and other scientific endeavors that they paint as culturally oppressive .
Consequently , besieged teachers and others are still likely to find themselves on the spot to defend evolution and refute creationism , by whatever name .
Creationists ' arguments are typically specious and based on misunderstandings of ( or outright lies about ) evolution .
Nevertheless , even if their objections are flimsy , the number and diversity of the objections can put even well - informed people at a disadvantage .
The following list recaps and rebuts some of the most common “ scientific ” arguments raised against evolution .
It also directs readers to further sources for information and explains why creation science has no place in the classroom .
These answers by themselves probably will not change the minds of those set against evolution .
But they may help inform those who are genuinely open to argument , and they can aid anyone who wants to engage constructively in this important struggle for the scientific integrity of our civilization .
1. Evolution is only a theory .
It is not a fact or a scientific law .
Many people learned in elementary school that a theory falls in the middle of a hierarchy of certainty — above a mere hypothesis but below a law .
Scientists do not use the terms that way , however .
According to the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) , a scientific theory is “ a well - substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts , laws , inferences , and tested hypotheses . ”
No amount of validation changes a theory into a law , which is a descriptive generalization about nature .
So when scientists talk about the theory of evolution — or the atomic theory or the theory of relativity , for that matter — they are not expressing reservations about its truth .
In addition to the theory of evolution , meaning the idea of descent with modification , one may also speak of the fact of evolution .
The NAS defines a fact as “ an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as ‘ true . ’ ”
The fossil record and abundant other evidence testify that organisms have evolved through time .
Although no one observed those transformations , the indirect evidence is clear , unambiguous and compelling .
All sciences frequently rely on indirect evidence .
Physicists cannot see subatomic particles directly , for instance , so they verify their existence by watching for telltale tracks that the particles leave in cloud chambers .
The absence of direct observation does not make physicists ' conclusions less certain .
2. Natural selection is based on circular reasoning : the fittest are those who survive , and those who survive are deemed fittest .
“ Survival of the fittest ” is a conversational way to describe natural selection , but a more technical description speaks of differential rates of survival and reproduction .
That is , rather than labeling species as more or less fit , one can describe how many offspring they are likely to leave under given circumstances .
Drop a fast - breeding pair of small - beaked finches and a slower - breeding pair of large - beaked finches onto an island full of food seeds .
Within a few generations the fast breeders may control more of the food resources .
Yet if large beaks more easily crush seeds , the advantage may tip to the slow breeders .
In pioneering studies of finches on the Galpagos Islands , Peter Grant and Rosemary Grant of Princeton University observed these kinds of population shifts in the wild .
The key is that adaptive fitness can be defined without reference to survival : large beaks are better adapted for crushing seeds , irrespective of whether that trait has survival value under the circumstances .
3. Evolution is unscientific because it is not testable or falsifiable .
It makes claims about events that were not observed and can never be re-created .
This blanket dismissal of evolution ignores important distinctions that divide the field into at least two broad areas : microevolution and macroevolution .
Microevolution looks at changes within species over time — changes that may be preludes to speciation , the origin of new species .
Macroevolution studies how taxonomic groups above the level of species change .
Its evidence draws frequently from the fossil record and DNA comparisons to reconstruct how various organisms may be related .
These days even most creationists acknowledge that microevolution has been upheld by tests in the laboratory ( as in studies of cells , plants and fruit flies ) and in the field ( as in the Grants ' studies of evolving beak shapes among Galpagos finches ) .
Natural selection and other mechanisms — such as chromosomal changes , symbiosis and hybridization — can drive profound changes in populations over time .
The historical nature of macroevolutionary study involves inference from fossils and DNA rather than direct observation .
Yet in the historical sciences ( which include astronomy , geology and archaeology , as well as evolutionary biology ) , hypotheses can still be tested by checking whether they accord with physical evidence and whether they lead to verifiable predictions about future discoveries .
For instance , evolution implies that between the earliest known ancestors of humans ( roughly five million years old ) and the appearance of anatomically modern humans ( about 200,000 years ago ) , one should find a succession of hominin creatures with features progressively less apelike and more modern , which is indeed what the fossil record shows .
But one should not — and does not — find modern human fossils embedded in strata from the Jurassic period ( 65 million years ago ) .
Evolutionary biology routinely makes predictions far more refined and precise than this , and researchers test them constantly .
Evolution could be disproved in other ways , too .
If we could document the spontaneous generation of just one complex life - form from inanimate matter , then at least a few creatures seen in the fossil record might have originated this way .
If superintelligent aliens appeared and claimed credit for creating life on Earth ( or even particular species ) , the purely evolutionary explanation would be cast in doubt .
But no one has yet produced such evidence .
It should be noted that the idea of falsifiability as the defining characteristic of science originated with philosopher Karl Popper in the 1930s .
More recent elaborations on his thinking have expanded the narrowest interpretation of his principle precisely because it would eliminate too many branches of clearly scientific endeavor .
4 . Increasingly , scientists doubt the truth of evolution .
No evidence suggests that evolution is losing adherents .
Pick up any issue of a peer - reviewed biological journal , and you will find articles that support and extend evolutionary studies or that embrace evolution as a fundamental concept .
Conversely , serious scientific publications disputing evolution are all but nonexistent .
In the mid-1990s George W. Gilchrist , then at the University of Washington , surveyed thousands of journals in the primary literature , seeking articles on intelligent design or creation science .
Among those hundreds of thousands of scientific reports , he found none .
Surveys done independently by Barbara Forrest of Southeastern Louisiana University and Lawrence M. Krauss , now at Arizona State University , were similarly fruitless .
Creationists retort that a closed - minded scientific community rejects their evidence .
Yet according to the editors of Nature , Science and other leading journals , few antievolution manuscripts are even submitted .
Some antievolution authors have published papers in serious journals .
Those papers , however , rarely attack evolution directly or advance creationist arguments ; at best , they identify certain evolutionary problems as unsolved and difficult ( which no one disputes ) .
In short , creationists are not giving the scientific world good reason to take them seriously .
5 . The disagreements among even evolutionary biologists show how little solid science supports evolution .
Evolutionary biologists passionately debate diverse topics : how speciation happens , the rates of evolutionary change , the ancestral relationships of birds and dinosaurs , whether Neandertals were a species apart from modern humans , and much more .
These disputes are like those found in all other branches of science .
Acceptance of evolution as a factual occurrence and a guiding principle is nonetheless universal in biology .
Unfortunately , dishonest creationists have shown a willingness to take scientists ' comments out of context to exaggerate and distort the disagreements .
Anyone acquainted with the works of paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard University knows that in addition to co-authoring the punctuated - equilibrium model , Gould was one of the most eloquent defenders and articulators of evolution .
( Punctuated equilibrium explains patterns in the fossil record by suggesting that most evolutionary changes occur within geologically brief intervals — which may nonetheless amount to hundreds of generations . )
Yet creationists delight in dissecting out phrases from Gould 's voluminous prose to make him sound as though he had doubted evolution , and they present punctuated equilibrium as though it allows new species to materialize overnight or birds to be born from reptile eggs .
When confronted with a quotation from a scientific authority that seems to question evolution , insist on seeing the statement in context .
Almost invariably , the attack on evolution will prove illusory .
6 . If humans descended from monkeys , why are there still monkeys ?
This surprisingly common argument reflects several levels of ignorance about evolution .
The first mistake is that evolution does not teach that humans descended from monkeys ; it states that both have a common ancestor .
The deeper error is that this objection is tantamount to asking , “ If children descended from adults , why are there still adults ? ”
New species evolve by splintering off from established ones , when populations of organisms become isolated from the main branch of their family and acquire sufficient differences to remain forever distinct .
The parent species may survive indefinitely thereafter , or it may become extinct .
7. Evolution cannot explain how life first appeared on Earth .
The origin of life remains very much a mystery , but biochemists have learned about how primitive nucleic acids , amino acids and other building blocks of life could have formed and organized themselves into self - replicating , self - sustaining units , laying the foundation for cellular biochemistry .
Astrochemical analyses hint that quantities of these compounds might have originated in space and fallen to Earth in comets , a scenario that may solve the problem of how those constituents arose under the conditions that prevailed when our planet was young .
Creationists sometimes try to invalidate all of evolution by pointing to science 's current inability to explain the origin of life .
But even if life on Earth turned out to have a nonevolutionary origin ( for instance , if aliens introduced the first cells billions of years ago ) , evolution since then would be robustly confirmed by countless microevolutionary and macroevolutionary studies .
8 . Mathematically , it is inconceivable that anything as complex as a protein , let alone a living cell or a human , could spring up by chance .
Chance plays a part in evolution ( for example , in the random mutations that can give rise to new traits ) , but evolution does not depend on chance to create organisms , proteins or other entities .
Quite the opposite : natural selection , the principal known mechanism of evolution , harnesses nonrandom change by preserving “ desirable ” ( adaptive ) features and eliminating “ undesirable ” ( nonadaptive ) ones .
As long as the forces of selection stay constant , natural selection can push evolution in one direction and produce sophisticated structures in surprisingly short times .
As an analogy , consider the 13 - letter sequence “ TOBEORNOTTOBE . ”
A million hypothetical monkeys , each typing out one phrase a second on a keyboard , could take as long as 78,800 years to find it among the 2613 sequences of that length .
But in the 1980s Richard Hardison , then at Glendale College , wrote a computer program that generated phrases randomly while preserving the positions of individual letters that happened to be correctly placed ( in effect , selecting for phrases more like Hamlet 's ) .
On average , the program re-created the phrase in just 336 iterations , less than 90 seconds .
Even more amazing , it could reconstruct Shakespeare 's entire play in just four and a half days .
9 . The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that systems must become more disordered over time .
Living cells therefore could not have evolved from inanimate chemicals , and multicellular life could not have evolved from protozoa .
This argument derives from a misunderstanding of the Second Law .
If it were valid , mineral crystals and snowflakes would also be impossible , because they , too , are complex structures that form spontaneously from disordered parts .
The Second Law actually states that the total entropy of a closed system ( one that no energy or matter leaves or enters ) cannot decrease .
Entropy is a physical concept often casually described as disorder , but it differs significantly from the conversational use of the word .
More important , however , the Second Law permits parts of a system to decrease in entropy as long as other parts experience an offsetting increase .
Thus , our planet as a whole can grow more complex because the sun pours heat and light onto it , and the greater entropy associated with the sun 's nuclear fusion more than rebalances the scales .
Simple organisms can fuel their rise toward complexity by consuming other forms of life and nonliving materials .
10 .
Mutations are essential to evolution theory , but mutations can only eliminate traits .
They can not produce new features .
On the contrary , biology has catalogued many traits produced by point mutations ( changes at precise positions in an organism 's DNA ) — bacterial resistance to antibiotics , for example .
Mutations that arise in the homeobox ( Hox ) family of development - regulating genes in animals can also have complex effects .
Hox genes direct where legs , wings , antennae and body segments should grow .
In fruit flies , for instance , the mutation called Antennapedia causes legs to sprout where antennae should grow .
These abnormal limbs are not functional , but their existence demonstrates that genetic mistakes can produce complex structures , which natural selection can then test for possible uses .
Moreover , molecular biology has discovered mechanisms for genetic change that go beyond point mutations , and these expand the ways in which new traits can appear .
Functional modules within genes can be spliced together in novel ways .
Whole genes can be accidentally duplicated in an organism 's DNA , and the duplicates are free to mutate into genes for new , complex features .
Comparisons of the DNA from a wide variety of organisms indicate that this is how the globin family of blood proteins evolved over millions of years .
11 . Natural selection might explain microevolution , but it cannot explain the origin of new species and higher orders of life .
Evolutionary biologists have written extensively about how natural selection could produce new species .
For instance , in the model called allopatry , developed by Ernst Mayr of Harvard University , if a population of organisms were isolated from the rest of its species by geographical boundaries , it might be subjected to different selective pressures .
Changes would accumulate in the isolated population .
If those changes became so significant that the splinter group could not or routinely would not breed with the original stock , then the splinter group would be reproductively isolated and on its way toward becoming a new species .
Natural selection is the best studied of the evolutionary mechanisms , but biologists are open to other possibilities as well .
Biologists are constantly assessing the potential of unusual genetic mechanisms for causing speciation or for producing complex features in organisms .
Lynn Margulis of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and others have persuasively argued that some cellular organelles , such as the energy - generating mitochondria , evolved through the symbiotic merger of ancient organisms .
Thus , science welcomes the possibility of evolution resulting from forces beyond natural selection .
Yet those forces must be natural ; they cannot be attributed to the actions of mysterious creative intelligences whose existence , in scientific terms , is unproved .
12 . Nobody has ever seen a new species evolve .
Speciation is probably fairly rare and in many cases might take centuries .
Furthermore , recognizing a new species during a formative stage can be difficult because biologists sometimes disagree about how best to define a species .
The most widely used definition , Mayr 's Biological Species Concept , recognizes a species as a distinct community of reproductively isolated populations — sets of organisms that normally do not or cannot breed outside their community .
In practice , this standard can be difficult to apply to organisms isolated by distance or terrain or to plants ( and , of course , fossils do not breed ) .
Biologists therefore usually use organisms ' physical and behavioral traits as clues to their species membership .
Nevertheless , the scientific literature does contain reports of apparent speciation events in plants , insects and worms .
In most of these experiments , researchers subjected organisms to various types of selection — for anatomical differences , mating behaviors , habitat preferences and other traits — and found that they had created populations of organisms that did not breed with outsiders .
For example , William R. Rice of the University of New Mexico and George W. Salt of the University of California , Davis , demonstrated that if they sorted a group of fruit flies by their preference for certain environments and bred those flies separately over 35 generations , the resulting flies would refuse to breed with those from a very different environment .
13 . Evolutionists cannot point to any transitional fossils — creatures that are half reptile and half bird , for instance .
Actually , paleontologists know of many detailed examples of fossils intermediate in form between various taxonomic groups .
One of the most famous fossils of all time is Archaeopteryx , which combines feathers and skeletal structures peculiar to birds with features of dinosaurs .
A flock 's worth of other feathered fossil species , some more avian and some less , has also been found .
A sequence of fossils spans the evolution of modern horses from the tiny Eohippus .
An amazing fossil creature from 375 million years ago named Tiktaalik embodies the predicted and long - sought transition of certain fishes to life on land .
Whales had four - legged ancestors that walked on land , and creatures known as Ambulocetus and Rodhocetus helped to make that transition .
Fossil seashells trace the evolution of various mollusks through millions of years .
Perhaps 20 or more hominins ( not all of them our ancestors ) fill the gap between Lucy the australopithecine and modern humans .
Creationists , though , dismiss these fossil studies .
They argue that Archaeopteryx is not a missing link between reptiles and birds — it is just an extinct bird with reptilian features .
They want evolutionists to produce a weird , chimeric monster that cannot be classified as belonging to any known group .
Even if a creationist does accept a fossil as transitional between two species , he or she may then insist on seeing other fossils intermediate between it and the first two .
These frustrating requests can proceed ad infinitum and place an unreasonable burden on the always incomplete fossil record .
Nevertheless , evolutionists can cite further supportive evidence from molecular biology .
All organisms share most of the same genes , but as evolution predicts , the structures of these genes and their products diverge among species , in keeping with their evolutionary relationships .
Geneticists speak of the “ molecular clock ” that records the passage of time .
These molecular data also show how various organisms are transitional within evolution .
14 . Living things have fantastically intricate features — at the anatomical , cellular and molecular levels — that could not function if they were any less complex or sophisticated .
The only prudent conclusion is that they are the products of intelligent design , not evolution .
This “ argument from design ” is the backbone of most recent attacks on evolution , but it is also one of the oldest .
In 1802 theologian William Paley wrote that if one finds a pocket watch in a field , the most reasonable conclusion is that someone dropped it , not that natural forces created it there .
By analogy , Paley argued , the complex structures of living things must be the handiwork of direct , divine invention .
Darwin wrote
On the Origin of Species as an answer to Paley : he explained how natural forces of selection , acting on inherited features , could gradually shape the evolution of ornate organic structures .
Generations of creationists have tried to counter Darwin by citing the example of the eye as a structure that could not have evolved .
The eye 's ability to provide vision depends on the perfect arrangement of its parts , these critics say .
Natural selection could thus never favor the transitional forms needed during the eye 's evolution — what good is half an eye ?
Anticipating this criticism , Darwin suggested that even “ incomplete ” eyes might confer benefits ( such as helping creatures orient toward light ) and thereby survive for further evolutionary refinement .
Biology has vindicated Darwin : researchers have identified primitive eyes and light - sensing organs throughout the animal kingdom and have even tracked the evolutionary history of eyes through comparative genetics .
( It now appears that in various families of organisms , eyes have evolved independently . )
Today 's intelligent - design advocates are more sophisticated than their predecessors , but their arguments and goals are not fundamentally different .
They criticize evolution by trying to demonstrate that it could not account for life as we know it and then insist that the only tenable alternative is that life was designed by an unidentified intelligence .
15 . Recent discoveries prove that even at the microscopic level , life has a quality of complexity that could not have come about through evolution .
“ Irreducible complexity ” is the battle cry of Michael J. Behe of Lehigh University , author of Darwin 's Black Box : The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution .
As a household example of irreducible complexity , Behe chooses the mousetrap — a machine that could not function if any of its pieces were missing and whose pieces have no value except as parts of the whole .
What is true of the mousetrap , he says , is even truer of the bacterial flagellum , a whiplike cellular organelle used for propulsion that operates like an outboard motor .
The proteins that make up a flagellum are uncannily arranged into motor components , a universal joint and other structures like those that a human engineer might specify .
The possibility that this intricate array could have arisen through evolutionary modification is virtually nil , Behe argues , and that bespeaks intelligent design .
He makes similar points about the blood 's clotting mechanism and other molecular systems .
Yet evolutionary biologists have answers to these objections .
First , there exist flagellae with forms simpler than the one that Behe cites , so it is not necessary for all those components to be present for a flagellum to work .
The sophisticated components of this flagellum all have precedents elsewhere in nature , as described by Kenneth R. Miller of Brown University and others .
In fact , the entire flagellum assembly is extremely similar to an organelle that Yersinia pestis , the bubonic plague bacterium , uses to inject toxins into cells .
The key is that the flagellum 's component structures , which Behe suggests have no value apart from their role in propulsion , can serve multiple functions that would have helped favor their evolution .
The final evolution of the flagellum might then have involved only the novel recombination of sophisticated parts that initially evolved for other purposes .
Similarly , the blood - clotting system seems to involve the modification and elaboration of proteins that were originally used in digestion , according to studies by Russell F. Doolittle of the University of California , San Diego .
So some of the complexity that Behe calls proof of intelligent design is not irreducible at all .
Complexity of a different kind — “ specified complexity ” — is the cornerstone of the intelligent - design arguments of author William A. Dembski in his books The Design Inference and No Free Lunch .
Essentially his argument is that living things are complex in a way that undirected , random processes could never produce .
The only logical conclusion , Dembski asserts , in an echo of Paley 200 years ago , is that some superhuman intelligence created and shaped life .
Dembski's argument contains several holes .
It is wrong to insinuate that the field of explanations consists only of random processes or designing intelligences .
Researchers into nonlinear systems and cellular automata at the Santa Fe Institute and elsewhere have demonstrated that simple , undirected processes can yield extraordinarily complex patterns .
Some of the complexity seen in organisms may therefore emerge through natural phenomena that we as yet barely understand .
But that is far different from saying that the complexity could not have arisen naturally .
Misleading Semantics of Creationism
Only methodological naturalism can determine how all life came to be
“ Creation science ” is a contradiction in terms .
A central tenet of modern science is methodological naturalism — it seeks to explain the universe purely in terms of observed or testable natural mechanisms .
Thus , physics describes the atomic nucleus with specific concepts governing matter and energy , and it tests those descriptions experimentally .
Physicists introduce new particles , such as quarks , to flesh out their theories only when data show that the previous descriptions cannot adequately explain observed phenomena .
The new particles do not have arbitrary properties , moreover — their definitions are tightly constrained , because the new particles must fit within the existing framework of physics .
In contrast , intelligent - design theorists invoke shadowy entities that conveniently have whatever unconstrained abilities are needed to solve the mystery at hand .
Rather than expanding scientific inquiry , such answers shut it down .
( How does one disprove the existence of omnipotent intelligences ? )
Intelligent design offers few answers .
For instance , when and how did a designing intelligence intervene in life 's history ?
By creating the first DNA ?
The first cell ?
The first human ?
Was every species designed , or just a few early ones ?
Proponents of intelligent - design theory frequently decline to be pinned down on these points .
They do not even make real attempts to reconcile their disparate ideas about intelligent design .
Instead they pursue argument by exclusion — that is , they belittle evolutionary explanations as far - fetched or incomplete and then imply that only design - based alternatives remain .
Logically , this is misleading : even if one naturalistic explanation is flawed , it does not mean that all are .
Moreover , it does not make one intelligent - design theory more reasonable than another .
Listeners are essentially left to fill in the blanks for themselves , and some will undoubtedly do so by substituting their religious beliefs for scientific ideas .
Time and again , science has shown that methodological naturalism can push back ignorance , finding increasingly detailed and informative answers to mysteries that once seemed impenetrable : the nature of light , the causes of disease , how the brain works .
Evolution is doing the same with the riddle of how the living world took shape .
Creationism , by any name , adds nothing of intellectual value to the effort .

Herman Teague loved his new job as a greeter at the Wal - Mart Supercenter just off the 101 and Raintree Drive in Scottsdale .
It was n't about the money , about $ 180 a week before taxes for part - time work , or the benefits ( the company provided none to him ) .
Teague was living off Social Security , savings , and a comfortable pension earned after working more than 30 years as a metallurgist for U.S. Steel , mostly in Wyoming .
His primary health insurance was Medicare , and he also had purchased two supplemental policies .
But it had lifted Teague 's spirits to be back around people , he'd tell his stepdaughter , Linda Kilfoy , and her husband , Fred .
He started living with the couple just a few miles away from the Wal - Mart store after his wife , Cecil , died in 2000 .
Teague had been retired for years when Wal - Mart , which is North America 's biggest retailer and Arizona 's largest private employer , hired him in January 2006 to say hello to shoppers entering the store .
Herm
Teague made people around him feel good .
He always had a friendly " question of the day " for those he knew and a smile for those he did n't .
The idea of getting paid to schmooze a little with customers appealed to him .
Teague was 86 when Wal - Mart hired him , though he looked and acted like a much younger man .
He had heart problems and suffered from borderline diabetes and hypertension .
But his doctor declared him fit for work , and he did fine for several weeks , winning over customers and his much younger co-workers with his upbeat attitude .
But in late February 2006 , Teague complained at home of having a hard time catching his breath .
He was out of work for a few weeks , during which time he underwent an angioplasty , a procedure in which doctors use a balloon to open a coronary blockage and improve a patient 's blood flow .
But doctors told Teague that he was well enough to return to Wal - Mart , which he did on March 6 , 2006 .
What happened shortly after he punched in that day would become the focus of a significant court case decided by the Arizona Court of Appeals on April 1 .
And , sadly , it marked the beginning of the end of Herm Teague .
What happened was , Teague fainted a few yards from his greeter 's " station " just inside Wal - Mart and the back of his head hit the concrete floor , causing a deep wound .
He came to before emergency paramedics arrived and said he recalled nothing after sipping on a Coke he'd just bought at a machine near his work post .
On the face of it , you might think that an employer of any size , much less a mega - corporation that registers a profit of about $ 20,000 a minute , at least would have been willing to pay for the cost of Teague 's emergency room services , where the bill for stitching him up came to about $ 3,500 .
But Wal - Mart — whose famous slogan is " Save money , live better " — declined to give Teague even one cent in workers ' compensation benefits for the injuries he suffered on the job .
In addition to the emergency room fee , that payout would have amounted to about $ 400 a month until Teague was able to go back to work .
How Wal - Mart dealt with its aged " associate , " as the company likes to call its employees , paints a dismal picture that lays waste to what it calls its " Grass Roots Process . "
That philosophy , coined by company founder Sam Walton after he opened his first discount store in Arkansas in 1962 , calls for Wal - Mart executives to " listen to your associates .
They 're the best idea generators . "
Herm Teague 's stepdaughter says she knows what grassroots advice he would have given his bosses had he been given the opportunity .
" Herm lived his life by never asking for anything that he did n't have coming to him , and I never heard him speak out against anyone , including Wal - Mart , " Linda Kilfoy says .
" For him , there always was a right thing to do and you do it , whether you 're a person or a huge company .
He would have told them , ' Do what 's right , guys . ' "
Instead , Wal - Mart denied Teague 's claim in the summer of 2006 .
The company is self - insured , and manages its workers ' compensation claims out of a sprawling structure in northwest Arkansas , so big that the rows between workstations have street names .
After Teague appealed to the Industrial Commission of Arizona , Wal - Mart hired one of Arizona 's top workers ' comp defense attorneys to litigate against Teague 's claim .
In early 2007 , the case wound up before an administrative law judge at the Industrial Commission .
That March — a year after Herm Teague had gotten hurt — Judge Joseph Moore ruled that Wal - Mart did , in fact , owe Teague workers ' comp benefits .
But this was not to be an example of David slaying Goliath .
Wal - Mart instructed its attorney , Todd Lundmark , to appeal the ruling , which put the payments to Herm Teague on hold .
Another year passed .
Then , last April 1 , the Arizona Court of Appeals said Judge Moore had erred in awarding any benefits to Teague .
Herm Teague , the appellate court said , had been engaging in a " personal comfort activity " when he stepped the few feet from his greeter 's post to buy his Coke , and had n't been on an official work break .
Though no one had seen Teague faint and hit his head , it surely happened moments after he 'd sipped from his soda , the alleged personal comfort activity .
So , the court concluded , Teague 's injury had n't " arisen out of " his employment at Wal - Mart — he'd just happened to be at work when it happened .
The ruling stunned Herm Teague 's survivors .
Teague had died at age 88 in Scottsdale on February 11 .
" My personal opinion , " says Phoenix attorney Rick Kilfoy ( who is Linda Kilfoy 's son and litigated the Teague case pro bono ) , " was that Wal - Mart saw this as an opportunity to get a court to reduce the limits of employee liability in workers ' comp cases .
And they hit the jackpot . "
A Wal - Mart representative did not return phone calls from New Times seeking comment .
Kilfoy and others who knew Teague well say the protracted battle with the mighty Wal - Mart after his spill broke Teague 's spirit .
By the time he died , Teague had incurred about $ 200,000 in medical bills unrelated to his Wal - Mart head injury that Medicare would n't pay while awaiting the outcome of the workers ' comp case .
" He wondered if he'd have to go to jail for non-payment of debt , " says Linda Kilfoy .
" It was as if someone just started kicking him .
He was so embarrassed . "
Herman Teague 's workers ' comp case would make for a cautionary tale even if it were an exception to the rule governing Wal - Mart 's typical practices with employees .
But a review of the firm 's history of dealing with injured employees suggests that Teague 's experience hardly was exceptional .
In June 2007 , the Washington , D.C. - based group Wal - Mart Watch issued a position paper on the company 's dismal record in handling many workers ' comp claims .
" Problems with Wal - Mart 's often lengthy workers ' compensation process and rates of compensation are pervasive , ranging from contesting and failing to pay out on valid claims to intimidating workers seeking compensation , " it concluded , making note of a monumental class - action lawsuit filed against the company in Oklahoma last year .
That lawsuit alleges that , after plaintiffs filed claims for on - the - job injuries , Wal - Mart cut their pay , hours , or flat - out demoted them .
One of the Oklahoma plaintiffs claims she was forced to quit her job as a condition of her workers ' comp settlement , which is against the law .
" Wal - Mart is known for fighting even the simplest , most straightforward workers ' comp claims , " says Stacie Lock Temple , senior director of strategy and communications for Wal - Mart Watch , " dragging out the process and forcing its employees into lengthy arbitration or court battles . "
It 's not just plaintiffs ' lawyers and watchdog groups who have taken notice of Wal - Mart 's corporate attitude toward its injured " associates . "
The state of Washington took the unprecedented step in February 2002 of ordering Wal - Mart to relinquish control of workers ' comp claims for the next eight years .
The state earlier had moved to revoke Wal - Mart 's authority to handle its own claims after five audits showed the firm routinely failed to properly handle legitimate claims .
" Over the last seven years , Wal - Mart has ' repeatedly and unreasonably ' delayed giving injured workers the benefits they were owed under workers ' compensation laws , " the director of Washington 's Department of Labor and Industries wrote .
" In some cases , Wal - Mart employees were not allowed to file workers ' comp claims at all . "
Wal - Mart was allowed to remain self - insured but remains barred from administering its own claims until 2010 .
On the other side of the nation , the state of Maine announced in 2004 that Wal - Mart 's policy of challenging its workers ' comp claims was " off the charts " in comparison to other companies .
In that state , a " notice of controversy " is filed each time an insurer ( a self - insurer in Wal - Mart 's case ) challenges a claim , as is a memorandum of payouts .
Maine keeps track on a quarterly basis of how much insurers are paying in comp claims as compared with how often a claim is challenged .
" We think it keeps companies on its toes , " says Cheryl Crowley of the Maine Worker 's Compensation Board .
" Not every claim is a good one , certainly , but certainly not every claim is controversial , either . "
In the first three quarters of 2004 , Wal - Mart contested a remarkable 94 percent of its workers ' comp claims in Maine .
By contrast , that state 's largest grocery chain filed notices of controversy on just 17 percent of its claims .
Wal - Mart responded after word of its intransigence in handling workers ' comp claims became public .
By the end of 2006 , the company denied 51 percent of injury claims in Maine , a dramatic decrease .
Unfortunately , according to an employee at the Industrial Commission of Arizona , this state is far behind Maine in tracking specific outcomes of workers ' comp cases .
No one at the agency was able to provide New Times with how many of Wal - Mart 's Arizona employees ( more than 32,000 as of May 1 , about 25,000 full - time ) have filed injury claims , how many of the claims were denied by the company and were appealed by workers to the commission , and what happened after that .
Things have been on a bit of an upswing lately for Wal - Mart 's public image , with glowing news accounts of the company 's emphasis on " greening " itself , and its allegedly improved record in providing affordable health insurance to more of its employees .
Still , Wal - Mart continues to take hits via books , magazines , a blistering documentary ( Wal - Mart : The High Cost of Low Prices ) , activist groups , and in courtrooms , where juries in a number of big - money cases have come down against the super - firm .
One common theme centers on how the company marches into a community , erects one of its 200,000 - square - foot superstores and , by virtue of its generally lower prices , is able to unfairly wipe out competition ( especially mom-and - pop stores ) because of its reliance on cheap foreign labor and goods .
Another premise suggests that Wal - Mart has failed miserably in offering affordable healthcare programs to a majority of its workers .
This has forced thousands of employees to enroll in taxpayer - funded public health programs to ensure medical care for themselves and their families .
Evidence amassed in researching this story reveals that Wal - Mart ranks at or near the top , in every reporting state , of those employers who foist a chunk of the cost of providing worker healthcare onto the public .
The state of Arizona can provide some figures on the latter point .
In 2005 , almost 3,000 Wal - Mart employees and 487 dependents were enrolled in AHCCCS ( Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System ) , which is this state 's Medicaid program .
This cost Arizona taxpayers an estimated $ 12.2 million in that fiscal year alone .
All this seems to matter little to millions of loyal Wal - Mart shoppers , who continue to pour into the stores in record numbers .
On May 13 , Wal - Mart announced record first - quarter sales and earnings , listing net sales of $ 94.1 billion and net income of $ 3.02 billion , a 6.9 percent increase .
Lee Scott , the company chief executive officer , gave a slew of reasons for the upsurge , including one buried deep in the self - congratulatory glow : " A reduction of worker 's compensation accruals . "
CEO Scott may as well have been talking about the Herman Teague case .
Herm Teague was born in Clarkdale , Arizona , near Cottonwood , in 1920 , two years after Wal - Mart founder Sam Walton 's birth in Oklahoma .
A young man with a bent toward science , Teague also excelled at athletics at what is now Cottonwood Mingus High School before enrolling at the University of Arizona .
He interrupted his studies to enlist in the Army Air Force after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and flew more than 20 missions as a B - 24 pilot in the Pacific theater .
After his honorable discharge , he returned to U of A and completed his degree in metallurgy .
He married his high school sweetheart , Betty , with whom he had three children .
Teague 's field eventually led him to Lander , Wyoming , where he became the general foreman responsible for ore processing and shipping at a mine owned by U.S. Steel .
Wyoming suited Teague just fine , as he was a devoted hunter and fisherman — and an inveterate storyteller , to boot .
He liked to tell his closest friends , " Do n't stop me if I 've told you this story before because I want to hear myself tell it again . "
Teague 's first wife died in 1978 , and he married Cecil Slagle the following year .
The new couple spent winters in Arizona after he retired from U.S. Steel in 1982 .
When he became a widower again in 2000 , Teague remained active with the Shriners of North America , played golf , and explored his beloved Wind River Mountain range in Wyoming on horseback with friends .
By the time he reached his mid-80s , Herm Teague still was sharp mentally and did n't want to fade away into senior - citizen oblivion .
That 's what led him to the job at Wal - Mart .
On the day he got hurt at the store , Teague had clocked in at 12:31 p.m .
He went to his assigned post and greeted people , as usual .
About an hour later , he asked fellow employee Josh McKay to help him purchase a Coke out of a nearby machine because he was having a hard time seeing what he was buying .
McKay later testified that Teague complained about feeling poorly and appeared pale .
McKay handed the older man the soda and then went outside to gather up shopping carts .
Administrative law Judge Joseph Moore would ask Teague later whether he remembered choking on that Coke .
" Oh , yeah , " Teague said , adding , " I do n't remember when I fell .
Everything just went black .
The next thing I knew , I woke up and I was on the floor . "
Wal - Mart employees found Teague unconscious and bleeding on the concrete floor , and called 911 .
Doctors at a nearby hospital stitched him up .
Then they ordered a series of tests to determine what had caused him to faint for the first time .
The tests revealed that he needed a pacemaker , which was implanted the next day , March 7 .
Teague remained in the hospital for a few days before he was released .
He never set foot in that Wal - Mart again .
Herm Teague and his family did n't worry much at first about things like workers ' compensation claims .
Foremost , of course , was Teague 's recovery from his spill and from the more worrisome heart issues .
He resolved to return to work at Wal - Mart as soon as he could , to the job he had been enjoying so much .
But then the medical bills started to pour in , and Teague realized that Wal - Mart was n't going to cover the costs of the injuries he 'd suffered on the job .
He filed the proper paperwork requesting workers ' comp benefits , and awaited Wal - Mart 's reply .
The company 's answer : No way .
" We never expected them to say no , never , " Linda Kilfoy says .
" We live in this wonderful country , with good benefits for a lot of people , and Herm continued to think that if you get hurt on the job , which he did , and do n't ask for anything that 's not coming to you , which he never would have done , then your boss takes care of you . "
Teague enlisted his step - grandson , attorney Rick Kilfoy , to help him appeal Wal - Mart 's denial at the state Industrial Commission .
Wal - Mart retained Todd Lund­mark , a workers ' compensation specialist who had co-authored a handbook on the topic .
The burden of proof before the judge was Teague's .
Under the law , he was forced to undergo physical exams by two doctors of Wal - Mart 's choosing , which he did in January 2007 .
One of those physicians , Ernie Riffer , concluded that Teague 's fainting spell and subsequent head injury " in no way related to his employment .
[ It ] was related to his coughing and choking primarily .
It was compounded by his underlying cardiac condition . "
The second Wal - Mart doctor agreed with his colleague .
Teague did n't have the money to bring in experts to testify at the Industrial Commission , Rick Kilfoy says .
But the lawyer still was confident the old guy had a fighting chance .
" If he had been on a couch at home when he fainted instead of standing up on a hard surface at work , he would n't have hurt himself when he fell , " Kilfoy says .
" He was a few feet from where he typically greeted people , and he took a second to get a soda .
He was n't on a break , and there was nothing in writing at Wal - Mart that kept him from grabbing a Coke . "
Herm Teague was the first witness to testify at the Industrial Commission hearing .
It humiliated Teague even to be there , his stepdaughter says , and he kept his answers terse , not having much more to add than he'd sipped from his soda , fainted , and came to on the floor at Wal - Mart in a pool of blood .
Wal - Mart assistant manager Janice Kursch­ner testified that she had assisted Teague on the floor after he 'd fainted .
She said it was " unusual " for someone to drink a soda while on duty .
" They 're not to have anything on the floor except water , " Kurschner testified .
So , Wal - Mart attorney Lundmark asked her , it was n't okay for Teague to consume a soda near the machine ?
" Normally , no , " she said , " because we need somebody on the door at all times .
So he had technically walked away from the station . "
Rick Kilfoy asked whether " company employees [ are ] expressly precluded from purchasing and consuming sodas from that soda machine . "
" No , sir , " Kurschner replied .
" They can do it on their breaks and lunch . "
Kilfoy told the judge that Teague 's employment with Wal - Mart " contributed to , if not caused , his injuries . "
In his closing remarks , attorney Lund­mark focused on a 1970 Arizona case in which a woman working as a stock clerk for a school district injured her lower back while arising from a toilet at work .
Going to the bathroom , Lundmark argued , even at work , is considered a " personal comfort activity " by the courts as compared with a more - typical work - related injury , such as blowing out a knee while lifting a large object .
It turned out that the stock clerk , whose name was Sacks , had pre-existing back problems , akin to how Herm Teague had heart problems before fainting on the job .
In the Sacks case , an appellate court upheld an administrative law judge 's ruling that her back injury had happened " in the course " of her employment with the school , but had not arisen " out of " her employment .
Under Arizona law , that 's a huge distinction .
The court in that case said , " The mere fact that the accident occurred on the premises of the employer during working hours does not make it compensable . "
But in March 2007 , Judge Moore ruled against Wal - Mart , contrasting the Sacks case with the case at hand .
" Here , " the judge wrote , " the employer contributed to the personal comfort of customers and employees by placing the vending machine on the premises . . .
Employees had not been expressly prohibited from purchasing beverages from the soda - dispensing machine and had not been expressly prohibited from consuming such beverages at times during their work shift that were other than break times . "
Even so , the Teague case was far from resolved .
Rather than take their small defeat and move on , Wal - Mart commissioned its attorney to file a special action with the Arizona Court of Appeals .
That put any workers ' comp payments to Herm Teague on hold .
What really continued to eat at Teague were the mounting medical bills that Medicare was refusing to pay because of the still - pending comp case .
" He had doctors turning him away because they were n't sure if they 'd ever get paid , " Linda Kilfoy says .
" Even the hospice , when he was near the end , called us and asked what was going on with the payments .
I had to call the Wal - Mart insurance people and their lawyers to see what could be done .
They said they did n't know who I was or what I was talking about . "
Rick Kilfoy says he noticed a distinct deterioration in Teague 's demeanor and physical appearance as time wore on .
" Even though we had won at the administrative - court level , Herman was very , very depressed and worried at the whole thing .
Without being cliché about it , I think the ongoing battle and the mess with Medicare and so on was breaking his heart . "
Teague spent his last months going back and forth between Arizona and Wyoming , where he still had dear friends .
He died in February , not knowing the outcome of his workers ' comp case or what was going to happen with his substantial medical debts .
On April 1 , presiding Court of Appeals Judge Susan A. Ehrlich , writing for a unanimous 3 - 0 panel , overturned Herm Teague 's award .
" There was no evidence that Mr. Teague 's work substantially contributed to his injury to such a degree that it overcame the personal contribution of his pre-existing cardiac conditions , " Ehrlich wrote .
" Without an increased risk from work , the circumstances of Mr. Teague 's injury do not rise to the level of work connection necessary for compensability . "
Herm Teague 's body was taken to Wyoming for burial .
His family and friends held a memorial service at a favorite restaurant outside of Riverton , the town where he had lived for so long while working for U.S. Steel .
People flew in from several states to pay tribute to a man for whom a court battle with his employer over a piddling sum of money would 've been the last thing he'd have wanted .
" God knows they spent a lot more in attorneys fees than they would have spent on Herm , " Rick Kilfoy says of Wal - Mart .
Kilfoy 's mother , Linda , sums up the story like this :
" This had to do with how in the world do you keep a big corporation , the biggest of the big , from taking advantage of hard - working innocent people ?
Maybe you just can't . "
In late September 2019 , the first cases of what became Samoa 's measles epidemic were first identified .
By the end of the year , more than 80 people - mostly infants and babies - would die from the disease while nearly 6000 people were infected .
It impacted not only people on the ground in Samoa but , also members of Australia 's diaspora community .
So the other day , I was checking my sites for comments , and just doing the normal blog promoting thing , when I noticed an odd set of adsense things next to my post about the idiot who was driving the wrong way into a handicap parking spot in Must be a Mental Handicap Part 3 .
Supposedly , I have an anger problem ...
If you can't read it ( which is likely possible , as it is quite small ) , these are the advertisements :
Anger Classes Online Anger Management Program Psychology
You have anger ?
Do n't get me wrong , I think there are people out there that could have a great improvement in their lives if they took some anger management classes .
The problem is that I dont think google skimming my page should tell me or anyone else , whether or not we should be looking into some anger programs .
It could just be me reading into things a little too much , but somehow , I feel google might be trying to tell me something .
Honestly , I didnt think my post came off too much of a rant that would cause google to think I should enroll in some anger programs , but who knows .
And as a side note , I would like to apologize to anyone who viewed that page between midnight and 3 pm EST , as the map was backwards , thank you to my grammar nazi for pointing it out to me .
Judge rejects charges against alleged 9/11 hijacker
Mohammed al - Qahtani remains in custody
A Guantanamo Bay military judge has refused to approve prosecutors ' charges against a prisoner accused of planning to be the " 20th hijacker " on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Mohammed al - Qahtani will remain in custody as an enemy combatant , and the military can refile charges .
The United States had been seeking the death penalty against al - Qahtani and five other men in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks .
Charges against the other five were approved by Susan Crawford , the convening authority for military commissions .
The others are alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ; Ramzi bin al - Shibh , accused of being an intermediary between the hijackers and al Qaeda leaders and finding flight schools for the hijackers ; Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali , alleged to have sent $ 120,000 to hijackers and arranging travel for nine of them ; Mustafa Ahmed al - Hawsawi , accused of providing the hijackers with money , clothes and credit cards ; and Walid bin Attash , who is accused of training two of the 9/11 hijackers and assisting in the hijacking plan .
All six suspects are accused of helping plan the attacks in which hijackers flew two passenger jets into the World Trade Center in New York and another into the Pentagon in Washington .
Another hijacked plane crashed near Shanksville , Pennsylvania .
According to the 9/11 commission report , 2,974 people were killed in the attacks , not including the 19 hijackers .

2 accused of break - in at pot club after raid OAKLAND
Two men were in custody Friday on suspicion of breaking into a downtown Oakland building hours after it was raided by federal drug agents during a marijuana investigation , authorities said .
Arthur Palmer , 44 , and Kenneth Goss , 41 , both of Oakland , broke into 3333 Telegraph Ave. about 9:20 p.m. Wednesday , police said .
Officers responding to a report of a burglary in progress caught them as they were going out the back door , police said .
Agents with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration had left the building about 12 hours earlier after raiding it early Wednesday , one of 10 such operations at homes and medical - marijuana dispensaries in San Jose , San Mateo and other cities .
No arrests have been made and the details of the case remain sealed in U.S. District Court .
But Ken Estes , 50 , who manages the dispensaries , said Friday that he and several of his managers whose homes were raided fear they will be arrested .
Estes said agents seized 318 marijuana plants and $ 100,000 during the raids - and he blames the DEA for leaving his Oakland location open to burglars .
He said the agents apparently left some bags of marijuana behind , which made it tempting for the suspects .
Oakland police did not say what Palmer and Goss allegedly took from the building , and Estes is n't sure which items disappeared in the burglary and which in the DEA raid .
The federal agents " did n't even secure it up , " Estes said of the building .
" They wrapped an extension cord around the door .
I 'm sure it's not the only building that 's burglarized , but when people walk by and see that the back windows have been broken open and there 's just an extension cord , I mean , there 's a lot of people in that area of Oakland who would sneak into parts of abandoned buildings . "
Estes said he had not been allowed onto the property , even after the agents left .
" It has to be their fault , " he said .
" They take us and throw us out .
We all had to leave . "
Javier Pena , special agent in charge of the DEA in San Francisco , said of the building , " We secured it and we left the area .
We took evidence out of the building . "
Palmer is being held without bail at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin on a parole violation as well as on suspicion of burglary .
Goss is being held in lieu of $ 30,000 bail on suspicion of burglary and possession of a controlled substance .
Estes said he is upset at the DEA investigation because " I 've done nothing other than medical ( marijuana ) .
I 've dedicated my life to this .
The raid itself just shows that the federal government is out of touch with the American people .
The raid was just mean - spirited . "
Proposition 215 , the initiative approved in 1996 by state voters , legalized growing and using marijuana for medical purposes and with a doctor 's recommendation .
Under federal law , marijuana used for any purpose is illegal .
Pena declined to comment on the investigation .
But he said , " We go after the big clubs out there .
We go after the biggest and the baddest . "
Drainage systems were unable to cope during the 2007 downpours
The UK Meteorological Office says it has improved its ability to pinpoint where and when heavy rain will occur .
Forecasts of severe downpours will now be issued up to 24 hours earlier , it says , giving local authorities more time to prepare flood control measures .
The Met Office is also assembling a team of specialists who will issue the early alerts to emergency services .
Last summer , a series of unprecedented floods affected tens of thousands of homes and caused £ 3 bn worth of damage .
" The events of last summer have focused the attention of all agencies involved in severe weather and flood forecasting , " said Paul Davis , the Met Office 's extreme rainfall service manager .
" The Met Office has accelerated the delivery of its science and technology capabilities in order to meet the challenges ahead . "
The developments include : A system called STEPS , which models radar data to provide predictions of surface rainfall in order to pinpoint locations of extreme rainfall several hours before it occurs
Software that creates multiple forecasts up to two days in advance , allowing forecasters to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding possible extreme weather events
A computer model that forecasts how rainstorms will evolve , which will enable more precise predictions of rain intensity and location During the 2007 floods , England and Wales experienced the greatest volume of rainfall since records began in 1766 .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Davis said this was the main reason why there was such widespread devastation .
" The weather forecasts and alerts to emergency responders issued last summer were both accurate and timely , " he said .
" But the intensity and impact of the rain that fell ... was wholly unprecedented . "
In a number of cases , the flooding was not predicted by the Environment Agency 's flood warning system because it was a result of rainwater overwhelming already saturated drains and surfaces and did not involve rivers or coastal flooding .
Sir Michael Pitt , chairman of the review of the response to the 2007 floods , welcomed the Met Office 's announcement .
Laser maps flood - prone areas " The events of 2007 , where the public was given technical warnings which they often could not interpret , without advice on what action they should take , must not be repeated . "
He added that his final report , expected to be published towards the end of June , would call on the Met Office and Environment Agency to work together to " model and warn against all sources of flooding " .
" This will improve the speed and usefulness of flood warnings and ensure the public receive clear and consistent advice , " Sir Michael explained .
" Measures like this would have reduced the confusion experienced by the public in 2007 and will reduce the impact of future flooding . "

Representative Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) has finally taken action for justice equal to his own earlier strong words , cosigning H. Res. 1258 calling for President George W. Bush to be impeached .
Hinchey has not yet cosigned H. Res. 333 to impeach Vice President Richard B. Cheney , nor has he yet cosigned Rep. Robert Wexler ’s ( D - FL ) letter which calls for impeachment hearings against Cheney .
Hinchey cosigned H. Res. 1258 Wednesday along with Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , the two Representatives becoming the fourth and fifth cosigners of the bill authored by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .
Here are the cosigners with the dates they added their names to the bill :
Rep Wexler , Robert [ FL - 19 ] – 6/11/2008
Rep Woolsey , Lynn C. [ CA - 6 ] – 6/11/2008
Rep Lee , Barbara [ CA - 9 ] – 6/11/2008
Rep Hinchey , Maurice D. [ NY - 22 ] – 6/18/2008
Rep Baldwin , Tammy [ WI - 2 ] – 6/18/2008
Hinchey has been under pressure from many of his constituents to make a strong stand on impeachment ever since he publicly called for the impeachment of President Bush but then recanted – calling for the much weaker action of a censure of Bush and Cheney for their pre-war lies instead .
David Addington today offered a preposterous reason for refusing to answer a question about whether or not he was party to talks about torture with his superiors -- al - Qaeda may be watching CSPAN and he can't give away any information that may benefit them .

DELAHUNT : Oh I can understand why [ the President ] does n't talk about it .
ADDINGTON : Because you gotta communicate with al Qaeda .

Well , I 'm sure they are watching , and I 'm glad they finally have a chance to see you , Mr. Addington .

QUITO ( Reuters ) - From Argentina to Nicaragua , Latin Americans have elected leftist leaders over the last decade who are challenging Washington 's aggressive war on drugs in the world 's top cocaine - producing region .
These governments are shaking off U.S. influence in the region and building defense and trade alliances that exclude the United States .
Some now say they can better fight drugs without U.S. help and are rejecting policies they do not like .
The strongest resistance to U.S. drug policies is in Ecuador and Bolivia , two coca-growing countries of the Andes , and in Venezuela .
Decades of drug war demolition tactics have taken their toll on our diplomacy in South America :
This is just the inevitable consequence of bribing foreign governments to let our soldiers run around on their land slashing and burning the livelihoods of impoverished populations .
We 've declared war on the coca plant itself , insisting that it not be grown even by indigenous people who 've used it for thousands of years for altitude sickness and appetite suppression .
As it becomes increasingly clear that none of this is accomplishing anything , everyone 's starting to realize that we have no intention of ever leaving .
We literally go around giving report cards to sovereign nations rating their cooperation in our own hopeless effort to stop Americans from using drugs .
Both sides in the South American drug war are funded with U.S. dollars , yet we bare only the burden of our own indulgence , not the horrific violence and destabilization wrought by the endless war on drugs .
Thanks to democracy , however , the victims of our disastrous policies in South America may elect leaders who want to kick us the hell out .
I ca n’t say I blame them .

TV watchers tuning into the season premiere of Battlestar Galactica tonight have more accurate information about humans killed in the show 's space battles than they do about civilian deaths in Iraq .
This fetish for numerical exactness is part of what makes the show so realistic and appealing to non-scifi fans — but it's also what makes fans so freakishly devoted .
Because you can track every single death .
And we 've done that for you here , in a chart revealing the strangely detailed information Battlestar offers about its fictional population of spacers fighting robots .
Advertisement
Cylons have thinned an interplanetary civilization down to 50 thousand members , and as season four begins the humans have been reduced to roughly 41 thousand .
We even know roughly how many days it 's been since the first Cylon attack .
In our chart , we 've correlated each population change with an event , including when each new Cylon is revealed .
All this information comes directly from the show , where most episodes begin with a population number .
Numbers are also frequently bandied about in trials and policy debates .
Many of these numbers were faithfully recorded , in great detail , by the amazing folks behind the Battlestar wiki .
Is this emphasis on hard numbers a reflection of the U.S. obsession with numbers of dead in Iraq , or is it just part of a general trend toward realism in science fiction ?

You do n’t know that programming language
Original image by cote
Or maybe you do ?
How about your favourite programming language ?
What does it take to say that one “ knows ” it ?
michaelp asks :
When exactly do you “ know ” a language ?
There ’s a gradient of choices to pick from .
You know of the language — “ I hear they call it Java . ”
You ’ve memorized the “ hello world ” program — <? php echo ‘ Hello World ’ ; ?>
You know something unique about the language — “ Ruby has closures , but Java does not . ”
You have all of the documentation memorized — because looking things up is much too slow .
And just to get to the other extreme , you wrote a compiler for the language … in itself .
( That ’s actually not rare , and is termed bootstrapping . )
So what does it take for a programming language to make it onto a resume ?
Apparently not much , if you are a student .
“ Know ” is more like “ know of ” .
Though perhaps that is fair enough .
A lot of skills are transferable , and it ’s quite easy to pick up on new languages with similar paradigms .
I ’ve done this myself before :
Even though I had no experience with PHP or Oracle , I was fairly familiar with Ruby and MySQL .
My job offer relied on the claim that such web development is logistically similar , having substituted Ruby documentation for PHP .
Dan agrees .
I do n’t think “ knowing ” a language is any where close to as important as knowing the concepts of computer science and software engineering .
Once you have a good grasp of the basic and more advanced concepts , changing languages is trival and becomes easier with the more experience you have .
So perhaps it would be more honest to focus on what really matters — algorithms , design patterns , etc .
Memorizing the syntax / API will let one type out that bubble sort faster , though that arguably demonstrates the lack of knowledge that matters .
I recall the first drafts of my resume , as I ’ve started out in co-op at University .
I ’d list a dozen different programming languages that I knew of .
Now I would probably list none .
That is not to say that I have unlearned things over the years but , on the contrary , that it ’s true that the more you know , the more you realize of how little you know in the grander scheme of things .
So , with a few exceptions , I do n’t think one gets to “ know ” a programming language .
I also think that this should n’t matter .

WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Monday said judges may impose shorter prison terms for crack cocaine crimes , enhancing judicial discretion to reduce the disparity between sentences for crack and cocaine powder .
By a 7 - 2 vote , the court said that a 15 - year sentence given to Derrick Kimbrough , a veteran of the 1991 war with Iraq , was acceptable , even though federal sentencing guidelines called for Kimbrough to receive 19 to 22 years .
In a separate sentencing case that did not involve crack cocaine , the court also ruled in favor of judicial discretion to impose more lenient sentences than federal guidelines recommend .
The challenges to criminal sentences center on a judge ’s discretion to impose a shorter sentence than is called for in guidelines established by the U.S. Sentencing Commission , at Congress ’ direction .
The guidelines were adopted in the mid-1980s to help produce uniform punishments for similar crimes .
The cases are the result of a decision three years ago in which the justices ruled that judges need not strictly follow the sentencing guidelines .
Instead , appellate courts would review sentences for reasonableness , although the court has since struggled to define what it meant by that term .
Kimbrough ’s case did not present the justices with the ultimate question of the fairness of the disparity in crack and powder cocaine sentences .
In a time when 5 - 4 Supreme Court rulings are the norm , this 7 - 2 ruling is a strong signal that the courts should have more discretion when sentencing individuals .
Some may call this ruling “ judicial activism ” and one could probably make that case .
But assuming that this is judicial activism , I would argue that the courts are constitutionally held to an even higher duty to make sure the punishment fits the crime ; to do justice .
When the prescribed punishment violates common sense , then judicial activism is completely appropriate ( see my posts about Genarlow Wilson here , here , and here ) .
We cannot reasonably expect the courts to be reasonable if state and federal laws tie the hands of the judges with unreasonable mandatory minimum sentencing laws .
The article continues :
Congress wrote the harsher treatment for crack into a law that sets a mandatory minimum five - year prison sentence for trafficking in 5 grams of crack cocaine or 100 times as much cocaine powder .
The law also sets maximum terms .
Seventy percent of crack defendants are given the mandatory prison terms .
Kimbrough is among the remaining 30 percent who , under the guidelines , get even more time in prison because they are convicted of trafficking in more than the amount of crack that triggers the minimum sentences .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , writing for the majority , said , “ A reviewing court could not rationally conclude that it was an abuse of discretion ” to cut four years off the guidelines - recommended sentence for Kimbrough .
Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented .
The Sentencing Commission recently changed the guidelines to reduce the disparity in prison time for the two crimes .
New guidelines took effect Nov. 1 after Congress took no action to overturn the change .
The commission is scheduled to vote Tuesday afternoon on the retroactive application of the crack cocaine guideline amendment that went into effect on Nov. 1 .
The commission has estimated 19,500 inmates could apply for sentence reductions under the proposal .
I certainly hope these 19,500 inmates do just that ; these 19,500 spots would serve us all better if they were taken by violent criminals who are a genuine threat to the life , liberty , and property of us all .
The Supreme Court also made a ruling on another mandatory minimums case :
In the other case , the court , also by a 7 - 2 vote , upheld a sentence of probation for Brian Gall for his role in a conspiracy to sell 10,000 pills of ecstasy .
U.S. District Judge Robert Pratt of Des Moines , Iowa , determined that Gall had voluntarily quit selling drugs several years before he was implicated , stopped drinking , graduated from college and built a successful business .
The guidelines said Gall should have been sent to prison for 30 to 37 months .
The sentence was reasonable , Justice John Paul Stevens said in his majority opinion .
Alito and Thomas again dissented .
The cases are Kimbrough v. U.S. , 06-6330 , and Gall v. U.S. , 06-7949 .
Another case of judicial activism ?
The court was once again correct to choose probation over prison .
Mr. Gall had already taken steps to be a productive , law abiding citizen .
What good would come of putting an already rehabilitated individual into the prison system ?
These are only questions which can be answered by a judge or a jury ; not an arbitrary one - size - fits - all mandatory minimum sentencing law .
Dear ArmeniaNow readers :
Thank you for 14 years of giving us reason to do what we do on these pages .
Today , however , we do it for the last time .
With this edition we conclude a fabulous episode of Armenia journalism .
And we finish with great expectations for how the journalists who produce these pages will continue their influence on local media , as they look for new homes for their work .
Find them .
Follow their work .
In July , 2002 , ArmeniaNow appeared out of nowhere before there was much chance of sustaining an online journal from a country where dial - up was still about as good as cyber connection got and waaaay before “ social media ” was legitimized .
We began with the intention of filling a gap that we believed existed in society ’s transition from a special - interests - influenced , to a more independent - based media environment .
While ArmeniaNow ( and our parent NGO New Times Journalism Training Center ) , was surely not the first to offer “ western style ” journalism training , there was , however , a missing element in getting from the classroom to the newsroom . . .
When the Federal Reserve helped plan a bailout in 1998 of Long Term Capital Management , the hedge fund , Bear Stearns proudly refused to join the effort .
Until recent weeks , Alan “ Ace ” Greenberg , Bear Stearns ’s chairman for more than 20 years and a championship bridge player , still regaled its partners over lengthy lunches about gambling with the firm ’s money in its wood - paneled dining room .
The cut - price deal for Bear Stearns reflects deep misgivings about its future and the enormous obligations that JPMorgan is assuming in guaranteeing the firm ’s obligations .
In an unusual move , the Fed will provide financing for the transaction , including support for as much as $ 30 billion of Bear Stearns ’s “ less - liquid assets . ”
Wall Street was stunned by the news on Sunday night .
“ This is like waking up in summer with snow on the ground , ” said Ron Geffner , a partner Sadis & Goldberg and a former enforcement lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission .
“ The price is indicative that there were bigger problems at Bear than clients and the public realized . ”
The deal followed a weekend of frantic negotiations to save the ailing firm .
With the Fed and Treasury Department patched in by conference call from Washington , Bear Stearns executives held the equivalent of a speed - dating auction over the weekend , with prospective bidders holed up in a half dozen conference rooms at its Madison Avenue headquarters .
More than 150 JPMorgan employees descended on Bear Stearns to examine the firm ’s books and trading accounts .
Even as those talks took place , Bear Stearns simultaneously prepared to file for bankruptcy protection in the event a deal could not be struck , underscoring the severity of its troubles .
On Sunday night , Jamie Dimon , the chief executive of JPMorgan , held a conference call with the heads of major American financial companies to alert them to the deal and allay their concerns about doing business with Bear Stearns .

“ JPMorgan Chase stands behind Bear Stearns , ” Mr. Dimon said in a statement .
“ Bear Stearns ’s clients and counterparties should feel secure that JPMorgan is guaranteeing Bear Stearns ’s counterparty risk .
We welcome their clients , counterparties and employees to our firm , and we are glad to be their partner . ”
While Bear Stearns toyed with suitors like big private equity firms like the J.C. Flowers & Company , the only meaningful bidder was JPMorgan .
Protesters in several Chinese cities have gathered to demand a boycott of French products and denounce campaigns for Tibetan independence .
Hundreds of people demonstrated in cities including Beijing , Wuhan , Hefei , Kunming , and Qingdao - often outside stores of the French chain Carrefour .
Passions ran high , but the protests were closely patrolled by police .
Protesters say they are angry at the scale of protests that accompanied the Olympic torch relay in Paris .
They have also denounced French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's refusal to confirm whether he will attend the opening ceremony of the Games .
Pictures from the central city of Wuhan showed large crowds congregating outside a Carrefour supermarket .
' No to French goods '
The chain , which reportedly operates more than 100 outlets in China , has restated its support for Beijing 's hosting of the Olympics this August , but is accused by some protesters of backing the campaign for Tibetan independence .
There were also protests in Paris ( pictured ) and two British cities " Oppose Tibet independence , support the Olympics , " read one placard ; " Say no to French goods , " said another .
Some placards went further , depicting Nazi swastikas on the French flag .
Many protesters also bore images of the disabled Chinese athlete Jin Jing , who shot to prominence in China after fending off anti-Beijing protesters in Paris .
In Beijing , protests were reported at a Carrefour , and outside the French embassy and a French school , though police were said to have dispersed the crowds rapidly .
" For the moment , it 's pretty calm , " a Carrefour employee in Beijing told AFP news agency earlier on Saturday , confirming that dozens of protesters had gathered outside .
" There is a strong feeling that authorities do not want it to get out of hand , " said the employee , who did not want to be named .
Media ' bias '
The pro-Beijing protests were not confined to China .
In Hefei , protesters used lorries to block access to a Carrefour shop In Paris , several thousand protesters gathered in the Place de la Republique , many wearing T - shirts bearing the slogan " Let 's make the Olympics a bridge , not a wall " , reported the AP news agency .
Meanwhile , more than 1,300 protesters gathered outside BBC buildings in the British cities of London and Manchester to protest against alleged bias in the coverage of Western media .
Campaigners for Tibetan independence have used the Olympics torch relay in several cities around the world to stage public protests against Chinese rule in Tibet .
Scuffles between torch bearers and protesters in cities including London and Paris have forced host nations to mount tight security operations to protect the torch on its journey .

I began programming on an Apple Mac Plus around 1985 and have loved the capabilities computers afford ever since .
Being a math major in college , database design and programming seemed to come naturally and with the explosion of the Internet , opportunities abounded and 25 years later , computers are still going strong as an important part of the infrastructure of the world .
In addition to interests in computer programming , I love studying the Scriptures and also love Praise & Worship , which I lead from time to time around the country .
I have been and am an avid piano player , arranger , and singer , producing a CD album yearly .
When I first started taking lessons some 60 years ago , I never envisioned the role of the gift or the path it would take me down .
Today , I enjoy music as much as I did when I started and have even found a way to incorporate " computers " into it .
A match made in heaven !

Paleontologists from the University of Rennes ( France ) and the ESRF have found the presence of 356 animal inclusions in completely opaque amber from mid-Cretaceous sites of Charentes ( France ) .
The team used the X - rays of the European light source to image two kilogrammes of the fossil tree resin with a technique that allows rapid survey of large amounts of opaque amber .
This is the only known method to discover inclusions in detail in fully opaque amber .
Opaque amber has always been a challenge for paleontologists .
Researchers cannot study it because the naked eye cannot visualize the presence of any fossil inclusion inside .
In the Cretaceous sites like those in Charentes , there is up to 80 % of opaque amber .
It is like trying to find , in complete blindness , something that may or may not be there .
However , the paleontologists Malvina Lak , her colleagues from the University of Rennes and the ESRF paleontologist Paul Tafforeau , together with the National Museum of Natural History of Paris , have applied to opaque amber a synchrotron X - ray imaging technique known as propagation phase contrast microradiography .
It sheds light on the interior of this dark amber , which resembles a stone to the human eye .
“ Researchers have tried to study this kind of amber for many years with little or no success .
This is the first time that we can actually discover and study the fossils it contains ” , says Paul Tafforeau .
The scientists imaged 640 pieces of amber from the Charentes region in southwestern France .
They discovered 356 fossil animals , going from wasps and flies , to ants or even spiders and acarians .
The team was able to identify the family of 53 % of the inclusions .
Most of the organisms discovered are tiny .
For example , one of the discovered acarians measures 0.8 mm and a fossil wasp is only 4 mm .
“ The small size of the organisms is probably due to the fact that bigger animals would be able to escape from the resin before getting stuck , whereas little ones would be captured more easily ” , explains Malvina Lak .
Water to see tiny fossils better
The surface features of amber pieces , like cracks , stand out more in the images than the fossil organisms in the interior when using synchrotron radiation .
In order to solve this problem , scientists soaked the amber pieces in water before the experiment .
Because water and amber have very similar densities , immersion made the outlines of the amber pieces and the cracks almost invisible .
At the same time , it increased overall inclusion visibility , leading to better detection and characterization of the fossils .
Classification of species
Once discovered on the radiographs , some of the organisms were imaged in three dimensions and virtually extracted from the resin .
The high quality of these 3D reconstructions enables paleontologists to precisely study and describe the organisms .
The success of this experiment shows the high value of the ESRF for the study of fossils .
“ Opaque amber hosts many aspects of past life on our planet that are still unknown , and the use of third generation synchrotron sources will continue to play an important role in unveiling them ” , asserts Malvina Lak .

Ben Stillers New Movie Tropic Thunder Looks Like It Will Be Funny As Hell
Can you guess the African American in the photograph above ?
It is none other than Robert Downey Jr. playing Kirk Lazarus , a very serious Oscar - winning actor cast in the most expensive Vietnam war epic ever filmed .
The problem is “ Kirk ’s ” character was originally written to be black .
So he decided to dye his skin… .
Now is this funny ?
Mean ?
Depends on who you ask .
Now I ’ll give you one guess on who could cowrite and direct a soon to be ‘ comic masterpiece ’ .
You guessed it , Ben Stiller who will also be starring with Jack Black and RDJr in the movie described as a modern day Apocalypse Now .
Paramount plans to debut the trailer online March 17 .
In one of Downey ’s scenes , he tries to bond with a real African - American castmate by quoting the theme song from The Jeffersons .
Downey is confident he never crossed the line .
” At the end of the day , it ’s always about how well you commit to the character , ” he says .
” I dove in with both feet .
If I did n’t feel it was morally sound , or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I ’m just C. Thomas Howell in Soul Man , I would ’ve stayed home . ”

In Shakespeare ’s Tempest , Ariel deceitfully sings to Ferdinand :
Full fathom five thy father lies ;
Of his bones are coral made ;
Those are pearls that were his eyes :
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange .
This rich language has so captivated the ears of generations of writers that they feel compelled to describe as “ sea changes ” not only alterations that are “ rich and strange , ” but , less appropriately , those that are simply large or sudden .
Always popular , this cliché has recently become so pervasive as to make “ sea ” an almost inextricable companion to “ change , ” whatever its meaning .
In its original context , it meant nothing more complex than “ a change caused by the sea . ”
Since the phrase is almost always improperly used and is greatly over - used , it has suffered a swamp change into something dull and tiresome .
Avoid the phrase ; otherwise you will irritate those who know it and puzzle those who do not .

Although solar cell technology for converting the sun 's power into electricity has improved steadily in recent years , high costs and inefficiencies have kept it from being a serious replacement for fossil fuels .
A few high - tech heavyweights — IBM , Intel and Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) — hope to change this using the same formula of mass production and commoditization that helped them make personal computers mainstream over the past three decades .
IBM last week announced plans to make solar panels covered with a thin film of chemical compounds .
The idea is that the film , when applied to different surfaces such as glass or brick , can produce solar energy more efficiently than conventional silicon wafer–based solar cells — which are made of materials similar to those used to fabricate computer chips .
( That 's right — a company built on chips based on silicon is trying to get the world to move away from using it in solar cells . )
Also last week , Intel spun off a new solar tech company called SpectraWatt , which was born with $ 50 million in investment capital from Intel , Cogentrix Energy LLC , PCG Clean Energy and Technology Fund and Solon AG .
Meanwhile , HP earlier this month began licensing technology to Xtreme Energetics , Inc. , in Livermore , Calif. , designed to help that start - up company deliver rooftop solar energy systems that produce twice as much energy as conventional solar panels at half the cost .
The timing of the push is right , according to a June McKinsey and Company report :
Although the cost of manufacturing and installing a photovoltaic solar power system has dropped over the past 20 years , the cost of generating electricity from conventional sources has been rising , along with the price of natural gas .
The McKinsey study noted that as competition grows in the market to deliver solar cells , competitors must relentlessly cut costs by improving manufacturing processes , investing in research and development , and moving production to low - cost countries .
IBM , Intel and HP are well - positioned to leap these hurdles thanks to decades of fine - tuning manufacturing processes for PCs , computer processors , and other tech equipment , not to mention their multimillion dollar R&D budgets and worldwide facilities in places such as China and India .
This helps these companies improve the performance of their products while cutting costs .
" We need [ companies such as ] IBM making this technology to get this stuff to the marketplace , " says Larry Kazmerski , director of the National Center for Photovoltaics at the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) in Golden , Colo .
A typical solar cell has an efficiency of 15 percent — about one sixth of the sunlight striking the cell generates electricity , according to NREL .
Silicon wafer–based solar cells , which account for 90 percent of installed solar capacity , are more efficient , converting up to 20 percent of the sun 's energy , whereas thin - film cells generally convert only about 10 percent .
This gap is expected to close over the next few years , making thin - film cells — which cost half that of silicon - wafer cells — a better bet .
The least expensive solar cells today are made using thin films of cadmium telluride .
The typical cadmium telluride cell converts solar energy into electricity with 10 percent efficiency at a cost of about $ 4 per watt — although NREL claims to have developed a prototype that converts at 16.5 percent efficiency .
IBM 's CIGS technology — for copper , indium , gallium and selenide — is a thin - film approach that will initially be able to convert at least 15 percent of the solar energy it receives into electricity , says Supratik Guha , a senior manager at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights , N.Y .
That compares with 19.9 percent efficiency for NREL 's version of CIGS thin - film solar cells .
Photovoltaic solar panels made from crystalline silicon can produce energy for between $ 2.25 and $ 3 per watt .
CIGS on glass panels can drop that cost to $ 1.50 per watt , Guha says , but he also acknowledges that solar energy will not be able to compete with fossil fuel–based electricity until it costs less than $ 1 per watt .
One way IBM is hoping to cut costs is by making its cells through a process that dissolves the semiconductor materials in a solvent to create a solution that is placed on a glass or metal sheet and heated until the materials adhere .
Until now , thin - film solar cells have been made in vacuum chambers — the semiconductor materials are placed on the glass or metal and then air is pumped out of the chamber , creating pressure that fuses the materials .
But such vacuum chambers are expensive to build and complicated to operate ( requiring monitoring of pressure , temperature , current , voltage , time and other factors during the process of making the thin film ) .
Guha is cautiously optimistic that the new process will be an improvement , " Conceptually , this is simple , " he says .
" But it 's still a largely unproven process . "
IBM will be partnering with Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co. , Ltd. — a manufacturer of computer chips , LCD televisions and other devices that require surfaces treated with chemicals to develop the cells ; he hopes to bring them to market by 2011 .
Intel 's SpectraWatt will start building a manufacturing facility in Oregon by the end of the year and plans to begin shipping thin - film solar cells made from crystalline silicon to solar panel makers by the middle of 2009 .
" All of the different solar technologies out there are all driving toward the same goal , " says SpectraWatt chief executive Andrew Wilson , " finding a technology that creates a commodity out of solar energy .
The customer cares about their cost per kilowatt hour . "
Intel is looking at components of solar energy systems outside of the cell itself , says Wilson , who is tight - lipped about the specifics of SpectraWatt 's technology .
He points out that the solar cell is only about 25 percent of the technology required to make an energy collection and conversion system .
" Intel is looking to drive [ down ] the cost of the overall system , " he adds , " not just the solar cell . "
HP and researchers at Oregon State University have been developing see - through transistors since 2002 by baking zinc tin oxide — a semiconductor — into glass or plastic .
HP originally envisioned the technology as a way to create computer displays in car or train windows , but Xtreme Energetics wants by 2010 to begin including this circuitry in its solar panels to improve their ability gather sunlight — another take on the thin - film model .
Because the solar panels would be transparent , Xtreme is also hoping that architects and builders will be willing to incorporate these unobtrusive solar panels into their designs .
" Today , most of these solar cell farms sit out in the desert , " says Xtreme CEO Colin Williams .
" The problem with these desert - based utilities is that they 're not anywhere near their customers , so they have to transport the power , which leads to a loss of energy .
We wanted to offer something that a company could install on the roof of its data center . "
It is still much too early to determine whether IBM , Intel and HP will be as successful creating a mass market for solar energy on par with what they did for computers .
" Thin film will be able to take the cost of electricity down to better compete with existing utility prices , " says Vasilis Fthenakis , senior scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory 's National Photovoltaic Environment Research Center in Upton , N.Y. , and a Columbia University professor of environmental engineering .
" But we really need to see in detail what these companies are proposing and whether it will truly be different from the solar technology already being developed for the past several years . "
The companies are funding their own research , without government subsidies or tax incentives , which may or may not come once the technology is ready to hit the market .
" The big question , " Fthenakis says , " is who can bring the price down in an unsubsidized market . "
Ageing Criminals Thieving German Granny Fools Police , Ambulance Service
An 80 - year - old lady trying to steal engine oil from a store in Germany collapsed as soon as she was nabbed by the store detective , but walked out of the hospital in a miraculous recovery shortly after being rushed there by helicopter .
Police said the cunning pensioner is a repeat offender .
A few years ago , I appeared in TV for the first time in my life .
Oil had just passed 38 dollars per barrel and I was invited to speak in a national financial channel as the president of the newly formed Italian section of ASPO .
When I said that I expected oil to rise well over 40 $ / bl soon , everyone in the TV studio looked at me as if I had just said something very funny .
All the other experts there hastened to contradict me and said that 38 $ per barrel was just a spike , speculation , and that prices would soon go back to " normal . "
Seen in retrospect , it was an easy guess that oil prices had to rise .
You only had to know a little about Hubbert 's theory .
As I am writing these notes , oil prices stand at around 120 dollars per barrel and may well keep rising .
But for how long ?
The problem with Hubbert 's model is that it is good for predicting production , but it tells you nothing about prices .
There are all sorts of economic models that attempt to predict prices , but their record is very poor .
So , maybe the answer can be found in historical examples .
If we can find a resource that has peaked and declined to zero or near zero production in the past , then its historical prices could give us some idea of what to expect today for oil .
There are many resources that have peaked and declined at the regional level ; crude oil in the United States is a good example .
But the price of US oil does n't depend only on US production ; it is affected by imports from other regions of the world .
So that 's not useful for understanding price trends at the global level .
What we are looking for is a global resource that has peaked worldwide or , at least , in an economically isolated region .
After much search , the best example that I could find is not that of a mineral resource but of a biological one : whaling in 19th century .
Whales are , of course , a renewable resource but if they are hunted much faster than they can reproduce , they behave as a non renewable resource ; just like oil .
We have good data about whaling compiled in books such as Alexander Starbuck 's " History of the American whale fishery " ( 1878 ) .
In Starbuck 's times there was no such thing as a " global market " for whale products .
But the reach of the whaling ships was worldwide and the effects of whale depletion were felt in the same way by all markets in the world .
So , we can take the prices reported by Starbuck as directly affected by the behavior of the production curve .
So , here are the results for the two products of whaling ; whale oil and " whale bone " .
Whale oil was used as fuel for lamps , whale bone was a stiffener for ladies ' clothes , as were fashionable in 19th century .
Whale oil production and prices ( adjusted for inflation ) according to Starbuck 's data .
Whale bone production and whale oil prices ( adjusted for inflation ) according to Starbuck 's data .
The results are clear : whaling did follow a Hubbert style " bell shaped curve " , approximated in the graphs with a simple Gaussian .
Whales did behave like a non renewable resource and some studies say that at the end of the 19th century hunting cycle there remained in the oceans only about 50 females of the main species being hunted : right whales .
Now , looking at the historical prices , we see an increase in the vicinity of the peak for both whale oil and whale bone .
For whale oil we see a spike after the peak , for whale bone the trend is smoother .
In both cases , the smoothed growth is nearly exponential .
We can see this exponential trend in the smoothed data .
Smoothed whale bone and whale oil prices ( adjusted for inflation ) .
It seems that what we are seeing now for crude oil parallels the historical data for whale oil and whale bone .
There are also differences ; for instance the prices of whale oil did n't rise so much as crude oil has been doing lately .
On the average , for whale oil we see a doubling of the price , followed by a plateau .
For whale bone , we see a much larger increase , more than a factor of 10 from the beginning to the end of the whaling cycle .
This increase is comparable to what we are seeing today for crude oil .
There is a reasonable explanation for these differences .
First of all , neither whale oil nor whale bone were so crucial for life in 19th century as crude oil is today for us .
There were alternative fuels for lamps : animal fat or vegetable oil , a little more expensive and considered as inferior products ; but usable .
Then , starting in the 1870s , crude oil started to be commonly available as lamp fuel .
It probably had an effect in keeping down the price of whale oil .
For whale bone , instead , a replacement did n't really exist except for steel , which was probably much more expensive during the period that we are considering .
But stiffeners for ladies ' clothes were hardly something that people could n't live without .
In comparison , crude oil is such a basic commodity in our world that it is not surprising that prices have risen so steeply .
Airlines , for instance , have no choice in between collapsing and buying oil at any price .
For other activities , the conditions of the choice may not be so stark , but still we can't survive without oil .
If the exponential rise of oil prices were to continue unabated for a few more years , we would be seeing some kind of demand destruction , indeed .
But the historical data for whaling tell us that an exponential rise of the prices is not the only feature of the post - peak market .
The prominent feature is , rather , the presence of very strong price oscillations .
We can attribute these oscillations to a general characteristic of systems dominated by feedback and time delays .
Prices are supposed to mediate between offer and demand , but tend to overcorrect on one side or another .
The result is an alternance of demand destruction ( high prices ) and offer destruction ( low prices ) .
What we are seeing at present with crude oil is , most likely , one of these price spikes .
Eventually , it will overdo its job of curbing demand and turn into a price collapse .
We can imagine how , in the collapsing phase , everyone will start screaming that the " oil crisis " of the first decades of 21st century was just a hoax , just as it was said for the crisis of the 1970s .
Then , a new upward spike will start .
Here , too , the history of whaling can teach us something in terms of the difficulty that people have in understanding depletion .
In Starbuck 's book , we never find mention that whales had become scarce .
On the contrary , the decline of the catch was attributed to such factors as the whales ' " shyness " and the declining " character of the men engaged " .
Starbuck seems to think that the crisis of the whaling industry of his times can be solved by means of governmental subsidies .
Some things never change .
In the end , the history of whaling tells us that what is happening now to crude oil should n't have taken us by surprise .
The future can never be exactly predicted but , at least , it can be understood from the lessons of the past .
One of these lessons , however , seems to be that we never seem to be able to learn from the past .

60 square miles of Lyme Bay will be off limits to scallop dredgers A ban on fishing in one of Britain 's " richest " marine environments is to be implemented to protect its wildlife and seascape .
About 10 % of Lyme Bay off Dorset and East Devon is to be permanently closed to scallop dredging and bottom trawling from July , Defra has announced .
The bay 's reefs are home to an abundance of sea life including rare sponges , corals and starfish .
Conservation groups have welcomed the ban but some local fishermen are angry .
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said : " Lyme Bay is one of Britain 's richest environments , and the measures we have announced today will protect the reefs and the wildlife that depends on them from the most damaging fishing methods . "
It 's catastrophic for inshore fishing , we feel let down , disappointed and disgusted
Nick Prust , South West Inshore Fishing Association
The fishing ban will cover 60 square nautical miles of Lyme Bay , from West Bay in Dorset to Beer Head in Devon .
The area will be off - limits to fishing boats which drag nets along the seabed .
Wildlife groups had argued this was damaging the environment .
Dr Jean - Luc Solandt of the Marine Conservation Society said : " In the end , most fishermen and conservationists want the same thing - sustainable fishing which has limited impact on the marine environment . "
Fishing organisations said they were furious and felt betrayed that a gentleman 's agreement to allow them to fish in certain parts of the bay and leave others alone had been rescinded by the Government .
Nick Prust from the South West Inshore Fishing Association said : " It 's catastrophic for inshore fishing .
We feel let down , disappointed and disgusted . "
Jim Portus from the South West Fish Producer Organisation said : " I 'm devastated , it will mean a £ 3 m annual loss for the local economy .
It 's not a happy day for inshore fishing . "
More marine reserves are likely to be announced in the forthcoming marine bill .

Los Angeles Police Department officials announced Tuesday that they investigated more than 300 complaints of racial profiling against officers last year and found that none had merit -- a conclusion that left members of the department ’s oversight commission incredulous .
It is at least the sixth consecutive year that all allegations of racial profiling against LAPD officers have been dismissed , according to department documents reviewed by The Times .
In 2007 , the LAPD ’s Internal Affairs Group closed 320 investigations into allegations that officers stopped , questioned or otherwise confronted someone solely because of the person ’s race .
Nearly 80 % of the time -- 252 of the cases -- the claims were dismissed outright as “ unfounded , ” according to an annual complaint report presented Tuesday to the civilian Police Commission .
In the remaining cases , there was either insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion or no misconduct was uncovered .
“ A big , fat zero , ” said a visibly flummoxed Commissioner John Mack , who is African American and the former president of the Los Angeles Urban League .
“ In my mind , there is no such thing as a perfect institution . . .
I find it baffling that we have these zeros . ”

His disbelief , echoed by other commissioners , drew a quick response from Police Chief William J. Bratton .
Unsolicited , he told the commission he would have his staff conduct a survey of other large , urban police departments , as well as the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department , to back up his belief that the findings in the LAPD are similar elsewhere .
Allegations of racial profiling , he said , hinge on what the officer was thinking at the time and , so , are nearly impossible to prove without a confession .
“ It goes to the officer ’s state of mind .
How do you get inside someone ’s mind ? ” he said in a brief interview .
Bratton rejected the notion that some allegations , while not proven , were legitimate .
“ This is not a racist department .
It is not a homophobic department .
It is not a brutal department , ” he said .
“ Does it have some officers that may be those things ?
Possibly .
But we search very hard for them , and their numbers are very small . ”

Tim Sands , president of the union that represents the department ’s 9,300 rank - and - file officers , had harsher words for the commissioners .
“ I am really outraged .
They are using a circular logic that just because someone makes an allegation , then the officer has to be found guilty .
That ’s mid-century thinking , ” Sand said .
“ They are supposed to be in a role of leadership .
I ’m sorry but that is not an attitude of leadership . ”
Sands , who himself was cleared of a racial profiling accusation about 20 years ago , said he plans to demand a meeting with commissioners to discuss the issue .
It is not the first time debate has flared around questions of how thoroughly the LAPD looks into profiling allegations .
Last year , the commission approved a new set of rules for how such investigations should be handled to address concerns raised by the U.S. Justice Department and the commission ’s inspector general after they probed the issue .
The guidelines include a checklist to ensure that officers are asked basic questions , such as whether they knew the race of the motorist before making the traffic stop and whether race was a factor in the decision to pull over the motorist .

LAPD Cmdr .
Rick Webb , who presented the report at the commission ’s weekly meeting , acknowledged shortcomings in previous investigations , including those closed in 2007 before the new guidelines were implemented .
He declined to speculate whether any of the previous allegations would have been sustained under the new investigative practices .
In November , around the time that the changes were adopted , the department stepped into another controversy when it launched and then quickly aborted a mapping program aimed at identifying the city ’s Muslim enclaves .
Civil libertarians and Muslim groups angrily denounced the effort as racial and religious profiling .
The debate unfolded Tuesday amid the commission ’s broader concerns over how the department handles the thousands of complaints made each year against officers .
In February , the inspector general released a report that concluded investigators frequently failed to fully investigate citizen complaints against allegedly abusive officers , often omitting or altering crucial information .
The report , and extensive media attention , sparked calls by commissioners for a review of the complaint investigation process .

The issue of racial profiling reaches back into one of the department ’s darkest periods .
Since 2000 , the department has been working to implement scores of reforms included in a federal consent decree that stems from the Rampart corruption scandal .
As part of the decree , the department is required to gather and analyze racial data involving vehicle and pedestrian stops .
But conclusive figures that might indicate whether systemic racial profiling is a problem in the LAPD have remained elusive .
Department and city officials early on acknowledged that the raw data collected by officers when they make a stop are unhelpful because they do not include factors such as the race of the officer , the predominant race of the neighborhood in which the stop was made , and whether the stop resulted in an arrest and conviction .
In 2006 , the city contracted with an outside consulting group to look into the issue .
The study found that Latino and African American motorists in most areas of Los Angeles are significantly more likely than whites to be asked to leave their vehicles and submit to searches when stopped by police .
The firm concluded , however , that its analysis of the data was too broad to determine whether the disparities were a sign of racial profiling .
After years of delays , the first phase of a project to install video cameras in police patrol cars is expected to start in coming months .
The cameras are expected to provide more telling information .--

The Amazon owned web statistics service Alexa has n’t been updated for 8 days with no comment from the company .
The last date Alexa is showing ( at the time of writing ) is May 19 , with the service usually being two days behind the current date .
I ’ve tried contacting Alexa via contact form , email and phone without success , although the last time Alexa had an outage back in January of around 5 days I also was n’t able to obtain an immediate response , instead waiting 10 days to get one .
Alexa is a service that people love or hate .
As perhaps the most open of all the web statistic services , Alexa has served as the leading web site ranking system for years .
On the flip side however their reliance until recently on data from Alexa Toolbar users caused many to ( rightfully ) question the validity of the statistics delivered .
Alexa relaunched their statistics tool in April with figures compiled from multiple online sources .
Alexa was founded in 1996 and acquired by Amazon in 1999 for $ 250 million .
Alexa as a business for Amazon really does n’t deliver a lot , however they ’ve likely already written off the $ 250 million and hence somehow Alexa continued on .
We ’re not writing Alexa off quite yet as this would n’t be the first time they ’ve stopped updating statistics , but the silence and length would suggest that something is n’t right .
We ’ll update the post if Alexa responds .
There is a lot of talk that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is now fated to lose the Democratic nomination and should pull out of the race .
We believe it is her right to stay in the fight and challenge Senator Barack Obama as long as she has the desire and the means to do so .
That is the essence of the democratic process .
But we believe just as strongly that Mrs. Clinton will be making a terrible mistake  for herself , her party and for the nation  if she continues to press her candidacy through negative campaigning with disturbing racial undertones .
We believe it would also be a terrible mistake if she launches a fight over the disqualified delegations from Florida and Michigan .
The United States needs a clean break from eight catastrophic years of George W. Bush .
And so far , Senator John McCain is shaping up as Bush the Sequel  neverending war in Iraq , tax cuts for the rich while the middle class struggles , courts packed with right - wing activists intent on undoing decades of progress in civil rights , civil liberties and other vital areas .
The Democratic Party must field the most effective and vibrant candidate it possibly can .
More attack ads and squabbling will not help achieve that goal .
If Mr. Obama wins , he will be that much more battered and the party will be harder to unite .
Win or lose , Mrs. Clinton ’s reputation will suffer more harm than it already has .
WRIGHTSVILLE , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Many people think they know the legendary Herschel Walker : 1982 Heisman Trophy winner , pro football star , Olympian and last week in San Francisco , an Olympic torchbearer .
Herschel Walker says he wrote about his dissociative identity disorder to dispel myths and help others .
But not only did the public not know the real Herschel Walker , the athlete himself said he did n't either .
In his just - released book " Breaking Free , " Walker reveals he has a form of mental illness called dissociative identity disorder , or DID , formerly known as multiple personality disorder .
" I did n't really learn about this until about 10 years ago , " Walker tells CNN .
" My life was out of control .
I was not happy , I was very sad , I was angry and I did n't understand why . "
Walker said his life went off the tracks shortly after his football career ended and when his now ex-wife was expecting their son , Christian .
The book , he said , is about coming to terms with his diagnosis .
He hopes to educate the public and break down stereotypes about this disorder .
When people hear of multiple personality disorder , they may think of Hollywood 's portrayal -- someone with different " people " trapped inside one body , but that is not accurate .
Everyone has various facets that make up his or her personality -- assertive , angry , comforting .
But , experts explain , in DID , these various parts -- known as alters -- do n't come together as one cohesive single personality .
Instead , one or the other part of the identity takes over and determines one 's behavior .
Watch Herschel Walker talk about his personality disorder with Dr. Sanjay Gupta »
Asked how many different personality facets , or alters , he has , Walker replied : " To be honest , I have no idea . "
But in the book , Walker talks about a dozen .
They 're described by their roles or function : the Hero , the Coach , the Enforcer , the Consoler , the Daredevil , the Warrior , to name a few .
Some of these alters did a lot of good , he said .
But others led to some extreme and violent behavior , most of which Walker said he does n't remember .
As a result , the disorder , or DID , led to the breakup of his marriage .
" I lost the person that was like everything to me , " he said .
" I lost my wife and that 's totally , totally devastating to me . "

Tonight , 10 ET see full schedule »
Walker said a competitive alter caused him to be a danger to himself , playing Russian roulette more than once .
In the book he describes another incident , the very late delivery of a car , that made him so angry he had thoughts of killing someone .
It was the moment he realized had to seek help , he said , which ultimately led to his diagnosis .
Nobody witnessed his alters surfacing more than Cindy Grossman , now remarried , but who was Mrs. Herschel Walker for 19 years .
For 16 years of her marriage , Grossman said , she did n't know anything was wrong .
That 's because Walker 's various alters were somehow kept in check .
He believes during that time , his alters did a lot of good .
They helped him train hard to become an outstanding athlete and student , smashing high school football records , graduating at the top of his class and evolving into one of the greatest college football players ever .
When football was out of Walker 's life , his alters were no longer focusing on a common goal .
That 's when things started to go wrong .
Dr. Jerry Mungadze , Walker 's therapist , said he 's seen at least three of Walker 's alters and believes that after retiring from football , Walker " had to find another way of coping and could n't . "
That search led to the chaos in Walker 's life .
Blog : Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Walker 's disorder
Grossman said that after Walker learned he had DID , things got a lot worse .
She remembers the emotional extremes : " Very violent alters and very sweet alters . "
When the bad alters surfaced , she said , Walker sounded different and his eyes would get " evil -- I remember just getting chill bumps when he looked at me . "
She said that Walker held a gun to her head a handful of times .
He also threatened her with knives .
She remembers one situation where at least two alters were involved :
She was in bed and could n't see very well because she did n't have her contact lenses in .
Suddenly , she said , Walker threatened her with a straight razor .
" He had it to my throat and kept saying he was going to kill me ... think he choked me .
I think I passed out .
" When I came to , there was someone else there [ saying ] ' Cindy , Cindy , Cindy .
Wake up , wake up ! ' "
Walker said he does n't remember the assault , but he also does n't deny it .
" One of the symptoms of DID is blackouts , " he said .
" I do not remember certain events .
Cindy and Dr. Jerry Mungadze have relayed confrontations which have been violent or aggressive , but I have no memory of any of it .
I 'm troubled by my actions and will always deeply regret any pain I 've caused Cindy .
Cindy has been a tremendous help in aiding my therapy and the integration of my personalities .
That 's why I wrote the book -- to assist others . "

There are no precise numbers on how many people suffer from DID .
But Stanford University psychiatrist Dr. David Spiegel has been studying multiple personalities for more than 30 years .
He estimates DID affects about 1 percent of the U.S. population .
He is not one of Walker 's doctors , but he said what Walker described is consistent with DID .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Dissociative disorders
Spiegel said DID is really a childhood disorder , which usually is n't diagnosed until adulthood .
DID stems from trauma , physical and psychological abuse suffered as a child , when the brain is still developing a personality .
" It 's a natural response to overwhelming repeated trauma . "
Walker said his trauma occurred in elementary school .
He writes " I was fat ... with a severe stuttering problem . "
Standing outside the now rundown building that used to be his elementary school , he said he had very few memories of his time there , except , " I remember this guy beating me up . "
" I used to get beat up a lot , and I could n't fight back . "
Spiegel said physical abuse does n't have to be by a family member and so being teased relentlessly and getting beaten up meets the criteria for DID , as is not remembering key events in one 's life .
There are no drugs to treat DID .
" It 's hard to get treatment and there 's no quick fix , but psychotherapy helps , " and people can get better , according to Spiegel .
Walker 's alters did not appear in his interview with CNN .
He seemed very friendly and generous .
Mungadze attributes that to the therapy Walker has undergone so far .
Walker is aware that his revelation may lead to ridicule or doubt .
" I 'm fine with that , " he said .
" I 'm ok .
I love me -- Herschel Walker .
You know 10 years ago I probably could n't say that .
But today , I can say that .
I 'm not going to say I 'm great or I 'm good , but I'm OK .

Infant sleep habits tied to obesity Less than 12 hours of slumber , TV viewing raise risk , study finds
A new Harvard study finds that babies and toddlers who sleep fewer than 12 hours daily are at greater risk for being overweight in preschool , startling evidence that the link between sleep and obesity may affect even very young children .
TV viewing heightened the effect .
The children who slept the least and watched the most television had the greatest chance of becoming obese .
" The two ( behaviors ) are acting independently .
In combination , they are particularly risky , " said the study 's lead author , Dr. Elsie Taveras of Harvard Medical School .
The findings , published in April 's Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , are based on mothers ' reports of their babies ' sleep habits and TV viewing , and direct measures of the children 's height , weight and skin - fold thickness .
Starting when the babies were 6 months old , mothers were asked how long their children napped during the day and how long they slept at night .
Moms were asked again when the children were 1 and 2 years old .
They were asked about TV time when the children reached age 2 .
The researchers combined the sleep answers to find an average pattern for each child during the first two years of life .
They found 586 of the children slept an average of 12 or more hours a day , and 329 of the children slept less than that .
Among the long sleepers , 7 percent were obese at age 3 .
The short sleepers fared worse .
Twelve percent of them became obese 3 - year - olds .
Adding TV to the picture , 17 percent of those who slept less than 12 hours a day and watched two or more hours of television a day were obese by the time they were 3 .
Obesity was defined as having a body mass index in the 95th percentile or above .
BMI is a measure that combines height and weight .
A 3 - year - old who is 3 feet , 3 inches tall and 40 pounds would be considered obese .
The researchers took into account other risk factors for obesity , including TV viewing , and still found the children who slept fewer than 12 hours a day had a doubled risk of being obese at age 3 than the other children .
Sleep 's impact on appetite hormones may explain the effect , Taveras said .
In earlier studies , sleep - deprived adults produced more ghrelin , a hormone that promotes hunger , and less leptin , a hormone that signals fullness .
TV viewing is thought to increase the risk of obesity both because it takes time away from calorie - burning play and because of food ads for snacks and fast food .
" The main message for parents is that there has to be regularity in sleep in children .
It 's very important to maintain a schedule , " said Dr. Michelle Cao of Stanford University 's sleep disorders clinic .
She was n't involved in the study but co-wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal .

" I do n't think of this as an IT project " .
The government says it wants to connect with families Given that " IT project " has almost become Whitehall shorthand for " expensive disaster " in recent years , Cabinet Office minister Tom Watson is probably wise to choose his words carefully .
He may also need all of his diplomatic skills to persuade voters that the government has their best interests at heart when it begins monitoring popular social networking sites such as Facebook , Netmums , Fixmystreet and MumsNet .
Ministers are keen to get in on the social networking act - seeing it as a way of by - passing traditional media to communicate directly with the users of public services .
The initiative is part of a wider Power of Information Taskforce , aimed at helping government departments make better use of the internet , led by Mr Watson , who was among the first MPs to blog .
They may even employ media monitoring companies to find out what the users of popular sites are saying about them .
They might not always like what they find .
Privacy concern A quick search on MumsNet under " Gordon Brown " throws up little in the way of praise for the prime minister .
" The only thing I 'd like to feed Gordon Brown is a knuckle sandwich , " says one member in a discussion on nutrition .
Another poster - in a discussion on lookalikes - compares the prime minister to " Javier Bardem , the serial killer in the Coen Brothers ' brilliant No Country For Old Men " .
The Conservatives are also keen to get involved
The government 's plans have also sparked concerns about privacy .
Mr Watson sees nothing intrusive about the government using open , commercially run sites to dispense advice and information .
" Having 100,000 mums on a social network like NetMums sharing ideas about how you bring up kids or what it 's like to give birth can be useful to government because they can talk about the services that they provide .
" Government can be useful to them to give them advice on what 's good and what is n't good .
" If 100,000 mums met at Wembley stadium there would be welfare rights advisers , clinicians , midwives , even politicians would get in on the act .
" But when 100,000 mums meet on an information community online like NetMums , you do n't get a politician talking to them . "
' Personalised ' services
Some have argued there is a whiff of " Big Brother " about the plans .
Mums congregating at Wembley is one thing , but how would those " mums " feel if they were chatting with friends in a coffee shop - an experience that has more in common with being online than visiting a football ground - while a government official hovered nearby taking notes and butting in with helpful suggestions ?
For Mr Watson , it is simply a question of following the voters .
" We have got to go where our citizens are congregating , " he says .
If members of a social networking site were discussing which food additives were safe , for example , an NHS official could step in to offer advice .
Gordon Brown is the first prime minister to send out e-mails to his ministers
Tom Watson
Minister for transformational government " Someone in the NHS has a job , whose job it is to give advice about what additives kids can have and what they can't have , " he argues .
It is all part of Gordon Brown 's much - vaunted plan to " personalise " public services , he argues .
New guidelines
All of the main parties are trying to get in the social networking act - David Cameron and Nick Clegg have both taken part in web chats on Mumsnet and have a presence on Facebook .
But Mr Watson 's biggest challenge may not be the activities of political rivals but the slow - moving , inherently conservative nature of the government machine itself .
A recent report suggested the Whitehall culture was hindering the taskforce 's plans to encourage greater use of social media .
The rigid hierarchies of the civil service were at odds with the more freewheeling world of social media , where moderators and discussion leaders emerge by building up trust rather than being appointed , it found .
Mr Watson is hoping a new set of guidelines to be published shortly will help square the stuffy civil service code with the spirit of the internet , without landing everyone in court .
He also wants to get public servants using internal wikis and chat rooms to discuss policy formation and swap tips on " best practice " .
Technophobes
But he is taking things slowly .
" I 'm the lead minister on this , but what I can't do is wield the big stick on it .
If people do n't want to use these simple solutions for communication then I can't make them . "
The main message he wants to get across , he says is that " it is genuinely so easy to set up a Wiki or a chat room and that it 's useful to help people do their job and share ideas " .
Has he been helped in his task by having a few younger faces around the cabinet table under Gordon Brown ?
( some members of Tony Blair 's cabinet - including Mr Blair himself - were self - confessed technophobes ) .
" There is a generational thing with a lot of this technology and that 's as true in government as it is in the private sector .
" But Gordon Brown is the first prime minister to send out e-mails to his ministers . "
" I never got an e-mail off Tony Blair , " adds Mr Watson , who was famously forced to quit government over his alleged role in a plot to topple the former prime minister in 2006 .
Does he receive many e-mails from Mr Brown ?
" I do n't get many , but when I get do get one I respond to it very quickly , " he laughs .

What are these ?
High school students with a delayed school start time are more likely to take advantage of the extra time in bed , and less likely to report daytime sleepiness , according to a research abstract that will be presented on June 9 at SLEEP 2008 , the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies ( APSS ) .
The study , authored by Zaw W. Htwe , MD , of Norwalk Hospital 's Sleep Disorders Center in Norwalk , Conn. , focused on 259 high school students who completed the condensed School Sleep Habits Questionnaire .
Prior to the delay , students reported sleeping a mean of 422 minutes ( 7.03 hours ) per school night , with a mean bed - time of 10:52 p.m. and a mean wake - up time as 6:12 a.m .
According to the results , after a 40 - minute delay in the school start time from 7:35 a.m. to 8:15 a.m. , students slept significantly longer on school nights .
Total sleep time on school nights increased 33 minutes , which was due mainly to a later rise time .
These changes were consistent across all age groups .
Students ' bedtime on school nights was marginally later , and weekend night sleep time decreased slightly .
More students reported " no problem " with sleepiness after the schedule change .
" Following a 40 - minute delay in start time , the students utilized 83 percent of the extra time for sleep .
This increase in sleep time came as a result of being able to ' sleep in ' to 6:53 a.m. , with little delay in their reported school night bedtime .
This study demonstrates that students given the opportunity to sleep longer , will , rather than extend their wake activities on school nights , " said Mary B. O'Malley , MD , PhD , corresponding author of the study .
It is recommended that adolescents get nine hours of nightly sleep .
I ’ve been playing around with FoxyTunes , installing it in Firefox , getting the TwittyTunes extension .
And it ’s not just because I like music .
I think what ’s happening here is very powerful .
Let ’s start with Twitter , it looks harmless and gormless , what possible use could it have ?
After all , what can you do in 140 characters ?
Let ’s see .
First off , I can send messages that look like the one below .
I typed it in myself , it described what I was doing at the time .
What do n’t I like about it ?
Well , it ’s not good enough for the 21st century .
For starters , I should n’t have to type it in .
Something should be scraping what I am doing , capturing it in a way I can choose to share with others .
Choose , we must remember that word .
And what else ?
Oh yes , would n’t it be nice if I could enrich the information I was sending ?
Provide more information about the artist or group , maybe YouTube video links , maybe Wikipedia links , maybe Flickr links , maybe even the homepage of the band or group .
How about a link to the song itself , so that someone else can sample it , try it out , decide for themselves if they like it ?
Maybe even a way to search for more information , and the tools to buy the CD or DVD in physical or digital format ?
Chance would be a fine thing , but ….. how can I SMS all that ?
But wait a minute , the 140 character limit is n’t a real limit , not if I send a short url linking to all that .
Or even better , having someone do that for me , a web service like tinyurl .
So now all I need is for someone to build an app that scrapes what I am listening to , figures out what it is , goes and collects the enrichments and conveniences I want to send with the information ( band links , YouTube , Flickr , Google , Amazon , the Facebook fan page , maybe a Netvibes collection of related feeds , the Wikipedia entry and so on ) and then packages all that into a small space using something like tinyurl .
Which brings me to TwittyTunes and FoxyTunes .
Now my Twitter message looks like this :
It does the scraping , directly out of my iTunes .
It lets me choose whether to share what I am listening to with others , song by song .
It sends the message on to Twitter .
But that ’s not where the value is .
For that , you , the “ follower ” of my tweet , need to click on the link , and hey presto , you get something that looks like this :
You see , this is why I play with things like Twitter .
Not because I want to appear cool .
But because I am so old and grey and slow that the best way I learn is by playing .
Now I can really see how something like Twitter can add value in the enterprise .
And I ’m secure enough in myself to want to share what I find out , openly and freely .
Which is what I ’m doing here .
[ Without a business model or a monetisation plan in sight :-) ]
It ’s worth bearing a few things in mind .
First there was the web .
Then there was SMS .
Without SMS there is no Twitter .
Without the web there is no Twitter .
Now we ’ve had tinyurl for a long time , but it starts coming into its own when we start using something like Twitter .
As a result of all this , someone else could build something like FoxyTunes ( which looks like Netvibes meeting last . fm ) , and then building TwittyTunes to connect up with the Twitter world .
And then suddenly everything else waltzes in to enrich what we can see and do , ranging from text to audio to video , from search and syndication and conversation to fulfilment .
What strikes me is the power manifest here , the power of connecting simple things like SMS and tinyurl and Twitter .
Small pieces loosely joined , as David Weinberger said .
We are moving into a world where open multisided platforms will dominate , with simple standards and simple tools connecting up wide open spaces .
We are seeing it happen now .
This post is not about FoxyTunes .
Or TwittyTunes .
Twitter .
Or Facebook .
Or Google .
Or Amazon .
Or iTunes .
Or Flickr .
Or YouTube .
It ’s about all of them .
It ’s about all of them , and the apps we do n’t know about yet , the ones that will emerge tomorrow .
How we can find ways of bringing all of them together and moving information around them , linking information between them , enriching and sharing that information beyond them .
By the way , we do stuff like this in the enterprise already .
This is what we use e-mail and attachments for , this is why we use mailing lists and address books and spreadsheets and documents and presentations .
All the things we ’ve grown to love .
Or , in my case , hate .
If you ’re like me , you ’ve had it with those tools .
Absolutely had it .
H.A.D. I.T . They are so not fit for purpose .
Or. looking at it another way , there is a generation of tools out there that are so much more fit for purpose .
We ’re not dealing with firehoses any more .
We ’re dealing with capillaries , as I discussed in my post yesterday .
And these capillaries carry and distribute information nutrients , and process and eject information waste and toxins .
The real power of all this lies in the increasing transportability of context .
Oh , incidentally , in the past , I ’ve found the tools for grabbing screenshots frustratingly complex and time - consuming , so I ’ve tended not to use them .
It is fitting that this time around , I could do all this easily .
Because of a project called Jing , and because I then had simple and seamless ways of going from Jing to Flickr to iPhoto to ecto to WordPress .
And guess how I found out about Jing ?
Through someone ’s tweet .
Also incidentally , it would be worth looking at the role played by the opensource movement in making sure we can move around so freely between all these applications .
Which brings me to a strange conclusion .
More a hypothesis .
Am I right in considering the possibility that VRM is necessary only because everything is not opensource ?
That good opensource obviates the need for VRM ?
Doc? Don ? Steve ?
Chris ?
Chris ?
Anyone out there ?

Lord Stern , the economist whose report on climate change helped galvanise world leaders behind the green energy movement when it was published 18 months ago , has admitted that the situation is far worse than the assumptions that formed the basis of his ground - breaking report .
" We badly underestimated the degree of damages and the risks of climate change , " said Lord Stern in a speech in London yesterday .
" All of the links in the chain are on average worse than we thought a couple of years ago . "
When it was first published , the Stern Review and its recommendations – zero-emission automobiles around the world by 2050 , for example – brought plaudits and brickbats from the different sides of the climate change debate .
A year and a half on from its publication , Lord Stern dismissed the doubters and renewed his call for urgent global action : " People who said this was scaremongering are profoundly wrong .
If anything , I was too reticent .
What we are playing for is the transformation of the planet , " he said .

Greenhouse gas emissions are growing much faster than previously thought because of several factors that were not fully appreciated before , including the release of methane from thawing permafrost , the acidification of oceans , and the decay of carbon sinks .
The worsening situation increases the need , he argued , for a global pollution - cutting agreement to be reached by next year 's climate conference in Copenhagen .
He also reiterated his previous estimates that governments and business must invest the equivalent of between 1 to 2 per cent of global GDP annually up to 2050 in new technologies and efficiency measures or face climate change of catastrophic proportions .
A global carbon trading system would be the " glue " for a worldwide climate deal , he said .
The sector to be most heavily affected by any global climate deal would be the energy industry , which accounts for roughly two - thirds of emissions .
" We need to have zero carbon electricity , or very close to it , by 2050 .
That means carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) in electricity by 2050 , it means nuclear , it means renewables , " he said .
The soaring use of coal in electricity generation , principally from China where a new coal - fired power station comes into operation every week , means that CCS – a technology that remains unproven on an industrial scale – will be absolutely crucial .
" We need to get better at carbon capture and sequestration very quickly , " Lord Stern said .
Not only is coal the dirtiest fuel , it is also the only major fossil fuel source where big consumer nations still have large stores within their borders , and it is relatively cheap .
For these reasons , most economists and energy analysts expect its consumption to grow massively .
Lord Stern gave his revised views on the same day that the price of oil hit a new high at $ 114.43 per barrel amid rising demand from Asia and industrialised nations .
He said : " This is about buying down risk .
Starting now , that means it requires at least 1 per cent of world GDP .
That is small relative to a planetary catastrophe . "
This YouTube is surely as damaging as anything Jeremiah Wright has said .
Yes : Wright was Obama 's pastor for twenty years , and McCain has no real personal history with Hagee .
But McCain sought out Hagee 's endorsement , has appeared with him in campaign settings and has said he is " pleased " and " very honored " to have his endorsement .
Blaming Katrina on New Orleans ' " sinfulness " is more specific than Wright 's " chickens " .
McCain needs , I think , to denounce and reject his support :

It 's one thing to share an album that has already been released , which is illegal because it constitutes copyright infringement .
However , it 's an entirely different matter to leak unreleased material , as a poster who goes by the nom de blog " Skwerl " on the Antiquiet blog discovered Monday .
Two " Mulder and Scully types " tracked him down at his workplace and questioned him about where he obtained the nine unreleased Guns N' Roses tracks that he distributed through his website , pictured to the right .
The agents also visited him at his California home at 7 a.m. Tuesday , according to Rolling Stone .
" I was n't sure if they were going to come by with a warrant and trash the place , like in the movies , " Skwerl told the publication .
" Itwas nothing like that . "
The authorities wanted to see the original files , whichSkwerl had obtained from an undisclosed source .
However , he had alreadydeleted them per Axl Rose 's legal staff .
So he directed them to copiesof the songs that were copied all over the internet after his blogfirst posted them .
So many people downloaded the songs ( including yours truly )
that Antiquiet 's servers crashed from the demand .
Soon after came theobligatory phone call from an unrecognized phone number with a Los Angeles areacode .
" It was a really cool guy from the GNR
camp that was a middleman between someone who was very angry and me , "
Skwerl said .
" He was trying to reach out and see if I 'd go without a fight , which ismore or less what I did . "
He pulled the tracks down , deleted them from his computer and receiveda cease - and - desist letter that hinted at potential legal action .
Finally , the FBI tracked him down , resulting in his meetings with them Monday and Tuesday morning .
Skwerl says that despite having admitted to distributing the files ,
he 's not too worried about getting his ass handed to him in a court oflaw .
" It 's may be ( see update below ) a legal gray area since it was n't fordownload ; it was n't a finished product , " he said .
" We are n't sure who owns therecordings .
I feel like I might survive this . "
Perhaps .
Under the 2005 Family Entertainment and Copyright Act , distributing an unreleased album is punishable by fines and / or a jail term of up to 10 years .
Update : Skwerl contacted Listening

Across the nation , the realization is taking hold that rising energy prices are less a momentary blip than a change with lasting consequences .
The shift to costlier fuel is threatening to slow the decades - old migration away from cities , while exacerbating the housing downturn by diminishing the appeal of larger homes set far from urban jobs .
In Atlanta , Philadelphia , San Francisco and Minneapolis , homes beyond the urban core have been falling in value faster than those within , according to an analysis by Moody ’s Economy.com .
In Denver , housing prices in the urban core rose steadily from 2003 until late last year compared with previous years , before dipping nearly 5 percent in the last three months of last year , according to Economy.com .
But house prices in the suburbs began falling earlier , in the middle of 2006 , and then accelerated , dropping by 7 percent during the last three months of the year from a year earlier .
Many factors have propelled the unraveling of American real estate , from the mortgage crisis to a staggering excess of home construction , making it hard to pinpoint the impact of any single force .
But economists and real estate agents are growing convinced that the rising cost of energy is now a primary factor pushing home prices down in the suburbs , particularly in the outer rings .
Dyer ’s Burgers in Mississippi has been cooking burgers since 1912 … in the same grease !
Maybe that ’s why some of us are so full of ….. cholesterol ?
Yuck !
How is made :
Our waitress explained that the grease is carefully strained every night after closing hour ( usually about 4 am ) ; and besides , the really old grease is always burning off , so the supply that supposedly never changes is , in fact , always changing .
Whatever .
The fact is that this is one heck of an interesting hamburger .
We are especially smitten by the many ways in which it is served : as a double or triple , or as a double or triple â€œcomboâ€ ( with layers of cheese ) , and with really good hand - cut French fries on the side .
The menu boasts that each hamburger is served â€ œAlways on a Genuine Wonder Bread bun.â€ 
…….
“ Back then , they did n’t have the flat tops and all this , so they cook in a cast - iron skillet , ” Dyer ’s owner Tom Robertson says .
“ As you cook more burgers , the grease grows , and eventually it becomes a deep - fried hamburger .
We strain and process our grease daily , but we ’ve never thrown it out and started over , so somewhere in there ’s molecules from 1912 .
That ’s what makes it so good . ”
This is a single Dyer ’s burger , good and crusty .
Big appetites order a double or a triple with two or three layers of cheese .
It automatically comes dressed with mustard , onion , and pickle . ”
“ Looks good … ”
We all love our burgers – big , fat and juicy .
Let ’s hope that we will not die young if we eat those …

WISDOM OF THE CROWDS
PBS Airdate : June 25 , 2008
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON :
In an election year , people might disagree about who makes the best candidate , but you do n't hear much argument on the merits of democracy : that millions of average people can , together , make a wise decision .
It was n't always so .
In the early 20th century , this controversial Englishman , Sir Francis Galton , tried to statistically test whether mobs of common folk were capable of choosing well .
And , as our musical correspondent Rob Morsberger tells us , what Sir Francis actually found was that , mathematically , at least , there 's often wisdom in a crowd .
ROB MORSBERGER ( Correspondent ) : Sir Francis Galton was a nobleman
And scorned the common masses .
He thought that votes of governance
Should be left to higher classes .
He 'd prove with all the data
From a contest inescapable ,
Of guessing even simple things
That commoners were incapable .
CARNIVAL BARKER : Ladies and gentlemen , step right up .
ROB MORSBERGER : What kind of contest might it be ?
CARNIVAL BARKER : Guess the ox's weight and see .
Guess the weight correctly and win a prize !
LITTLE BOY IN CROWD : It 's 100 !
ROB MORSBERGER : Said a little one .
ADULT IN CROWD :
That 's much too light , at least a ton .
ROB MORSBERGER : An eager crowd queued up to play ,
Eight hundred made a guess that day .
MATT WINTERS : So he had 800 data points .
CARNIVAL BARKER :
And now the ox's weight is exactly ... eleven hundred ninety - eight pounds .
There are no winners !
CARNIVAL CROWD : Ohhhhhh !
ROB MORSBERGER : Sir Francis knew the rabble
Would never guess the weight .
How might they judge important things ,
If left to meet that fate ?
With mathematics he would show
How far they went astray .
But in the end his theory
Was in total disarray .
Because a curve of all the guesses ...
ANDREW GELMAN : Oh that curve ?
It 's the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution .
Sorry , that 's what it 's called .
( The crowd laughs . )
ROB MORSBERGER : ... because graphing all the guesses
And determining their mean ...
MATT WINTERS : I think he was talking about the median .
ROB MORSBERGER : And determining their me - dee-een .
He showed that if the crowd were one , its estimate is keen .
He showed that if the crowd were one , its estimate is keen .
JIMMY WALES ( Founder , Wikipedia ) : Keen , yes .
ROB MORSBERGER : That 's because , while no individual guessed the actual weight , the average of all the individual guesses is exactly right .
ANDREW GELMAN ( Columbia University ) :
The average will generally be better than a randomly selected individual guess .
ROB MORSBERGER : The average of the masses assures us of success .
MATT WINTER : I think he was talking about the median .
ROB MORSBERGER : And the larger the number of guesses we toss in ...
MELISSA SCHWARTZBERG : ... the more likely we are to get the right answer about the oxen .
ROB MORSBERGER : His premature prognostication ,
They can not help but scoff .
JENNIFER HILL : Galton should have gathered more data before he went shooting his mouth off .
ROB MORSBERGER : Sir Francis ' hypothesis was rocked by ignoramuses .
He lost the proof he had avowed .
He found the wisdom of the crowds .
KELLY RADER : If you have a group of people and they each have tiny bits of information , then you can learn a lot , if we could just gather all those bits together .
ROB MORSBERGER : It 's just like Wikipedia .
JIMMY WALES : Well , this is n't exactly like Wikipedia .
It 's a little bit different .
MATT WINTERS : It could maybe be Wikipedia .
You do n't even need to be an expert , but if you know something , then you 're able to contribute , and that entry is able to be that much more informed .

REGIS PHILBIN IMPERSONATOR : Yeah , the audience lifeline .
JENNIFER HILL :
If the person feels like they can't answer the question by themself , ask the audience .
KELLY RADER : The audience is right over 90 percent of the time .
JENNIFER HILL :
There you go .
REGIS PHILBIN IMPERSONATOR : How 'bout that , Gelman ?
ANREW GELMAN : The wrong Gelman ...
REGIS PHILBIN IMPERSONATOR : Sorry .
ROB MORSBERGER : One by one we 're not too smart ,
But every guess it plays its part ,
And when you add them up you 'll find ...
ROB MORSBERGER AND CROWD :
The wisdom of the crowd .
Captain Ed :
Expect all sides to redefine McClellan in order to either boost or reduce his credibility .
To the Right , McClellan will have been the worst press secretary of modern times , and to the Left a man of extraordinary ability chased out of his job by Bush ’s minions .
The truth will be somewhere in the middle .
When he left office , most people on both sides considered him a mediocrity at best .
His status as favored punching bag for the hard Left can best be captured in the Keith Olbermann farewell McClellan received as he exited in April 2006 .
It will be particularly amusing to watch this fringe try to rehabilitate McClellan now .
Let ’s see that rehabilitation of character that Ed seems to think is going to happen .
Firedoglake :
For three years , Scott McClellan stood before the White House press corp and humiliated himself , saying things he knew were probably false or misleading , while pretending that by dissembling for his President he was serving his country .
In now confessing his sins and spins , he still clings to the hope of redemption by saying , gosh , they meant well , even if they were all lying about everything .
No rehab there .
Let ’s try Too Sense :
McClellan has every reason to lie or twist events : making himself a sympathetic character helps him sell books and he wants to minimize the role he played in one of the most flagrant violations of the public trust by the office of the President in history .
Nope , none there either .
Let ’s try Steve Benen :
One ca n’t help but wonder , of course , if this is McClellan ’s way of trying to save his own skin — as the Bush gang is condemned by history , McClellan does n’t want to be associated with failure .
Of course , if he ’d thought to speak up when it mattered , instead of after the fact , McClellan ’s ability to make a difference might have had an effect .
Now , it ’ll sell books , but it ’s a little late in the game .
Nope , no rehab there .
Maybe the GOS :
Well , that ’s one way to put it .
Another might be to say that for three years he willingly distorted and lied about Iraq , about domestic spying , about secret prisons , about torture , and of course , about the White House role in the outing of Valerie Plame .
Or he did n’t lie and , as the truth was revealed about these many issues , he chose to stay on and defend Iraq and domestic spying and secret prisons and torture and of course , the people who lied to him about their role in the outing of Valerie Plame .
Which is it ?
No mercy there , either :
What about the the Rude Pundit :
Hopefully , the book will tank , and McClellan will be reduced to blowing Hannity for nickels .
Screw this obsequious pig- fucking son of a bitch , this grubby little man-whore , attempting to purge his soul of the taint and stench of death and sorrow while pulling in a buck or two .
He ’s not honorable enough to have fallen on his sword , rhetorically or literally .
And he ’s not even loyal enough to have shut the fuck up ( at least an admirable quality in the abstract ) .
He deserves a room in Hell lined with televisions playing his sneering statements of complicity on an endless loop while he ’s forced to sit on a couch made of the bloated corpses of Katrina victims .
Way too little , way , way too late , you miserable bucket of spooge .
That ai n’t rehab in my book .
Even the libertarians are jumping on him :
According to press reports , McClellan says that the Bush administration lied to him about everything , all the time .
Which sounds about right , though one gets to wondering either just how clever McClellan is or how dumb he is that it took him so long to figure that out .
No , Captain Ed , the fringe is n’t going to try to “ rehab ” this dick .
What will be funny is watching Bush sycophants attack him because he has dared to speak ill of W .
That will be entertaining .
The first thing to establish about Mass Effect on PC is that it 's not a port .
" This is a conversion , " explained BioWare demonstrator Chris Priestly .
" BioWare hates ports . "
Considerable effort has been expended on adapting the science - fiction role - playing game from console to desktop .
Not only does it have the well - documented control , inventory , and hot - key changes , but it also has gameplay improvements informed by community feedback on the 360 original .
There are shorter loading times and faster elevators , and there 's less texture - popping .
Mass Effect PC also supports higher resolutions ;
Priestly illustrated this by focusing on Liara , whose freckles were apparently more visible ( we were also shown the infamous sex scene so we could see for ourselves how ludicrous The Allegations were , which we found a little bizarre ) .
Mass Effect 's conversion from pad to keyboard has made a big difference .
Shepard can map his weapons and biotic , tech or combat abilities to number keys and call on them without navigating menus , whereas the console version only permitted one hotkey ability .
Combat 's much more fluid and , as a result , more engrossing , as you can see in a pair of videos on Eurogamer TV .
Also small but significant is being able to order your team - mates around individually , which means you can place a sniper further away while ordering a shotgun - wielding stalwart closer to the action .
Simple , but effective .
Even changing the layout of the inventory to a list - based affair has made a difference , as you can see in the screenshot gallery .
You can see his hot - keys in this .
Look , up there .
BioWare has had to re-think the decryption mini - game for the PC , discarding the button - matching from the 360 .
Taking futuristic tech - gadget the omni-tool as inspiration , the developer has come up with a series of concentric circles ( with gaps in ) that spin around and present openings to the centre .
Taking these will lead to a successful hack or unlock , but you can still fall back on omni-gel if you fail .
Priestly likes this because it fits the world better .
And we like it too .
It all fits the underlying message from BioWare that this is the same acclaimed formula tidied up and converted to PC .
There are no content surprises such as new quests or characters , not even the Bring Down the Sky DLC , for now , at least - you may even get something unique at a later date .
So , in search of some surprises , we sought out BioWare 's Matt Atwood and asked him why PC fans are made to wait and what we can expect from Mass Effect 2 , among other things .
Men are overrepresented online when it comes to sharing creative work , according to a new report from Northwestern University .
Researchers Eszter Hargittai and Gina Walejko found that men were much more likely to post their writings , photos , videos , and other creations on the Internet than women , despite the fact that they were equally likely to participate in such activities .
The two researchers surveyed 1,060 freshmen from the University of Illinois - Chicago and found that about two - thirds of men and two - thirds of women engage in creative activities , regardless of their involvement with the web .
56 percent of the group as a whole said that they had posted some kind of creative work online , the most popular of which being creative writing ( blogs , anyone ? ) .
Video was the second most popular , which the researchers credit to sites like YouTube for making it easy to upload and share content .
When the groups were separated , however , two - thirds of men said they posted their work online , compared to only half of the women in the group .
Further , when Hargittai and Walejko controlled for self - reported digital literacy ( comparing only those who believe they have similar levels of ' Net - savviness ) , the numbers were about even .
" This suggests that the Internet is not an equal playing field for men and women since those with more online abilities — whether perceived or actual — are more likely to contribute online content , " Hargittai said in a statement .
" It appears that lack of perceived skill is holding women back from putting their creative content out there . "
Hargittai acknowledged that there may be additional factors at play that affected the ( lack of ) participation by women online .
For example , women may have greater concerns over privacy than men — I know that my father attempted to instill in me a very deep - seated fear that anything I might post online could lead someone to break into my home and murder me in my sleep ( so far , so good ) .
Women may also be less confident in the quality of their work than men , although if this were the case , things may not be as balanced as they apparently are after controlling for perceived digital literacy .
Specifically , men were more than twice as likely to share music that they had created or remixed , and also much more likely to post videos to YouTube .
Perhaps this is part of the reason why men are more likely to watch videos posted to YouTube — after all , you can't just watch one Jackass - like skateboard stunt without posting your own response to it , can you ?

In a stroke of weird genius , the people at GovernmentAttic.org issued a FOIA ( freedom of information act ) request to the US government to reveal the contents of the multimedia library on the International Space Station .
Probably happy that they were n't being asked about the Patriot Act , the government happily complied , supplying us with a 13 - page document containing the titles of every book , movie , and TV show in the ISS library .
Not surprisingly there 's a lot of science fiction in the mix , plus ( of course ) The Right Stuff .
But there are some shocking choices in terms of what got put in — and what got left out .

Imagine if you will that you are on the ISS for a tour of duty .
You can only bring a few things with you , so you 're relying on the ISS library to keep you entertained .
And you arrive only to discover there is ABSOLUTELY NO STAR TREK .
That 's right : you can watch every single Star Wars movie , every single Matrix movie ( including Animatrix ) , every Lost episode , all the X - Men , tons of Stargate episodes , and even The Princess Bride ( yay ! ) .
But no Star Trek movies .
No Star Trek TV shows .
WHAT THE HELL , people ?
Why does the government hate Star Trek ?!
I really could n't tell you , but I can tell you that the book selections are a little less mind - boggling .
There 's a heaping dose of Analog and Asimov 's SF magazines , the Foundation books from Asimov , some Greg Bear , some Kim Stanley Robinson , lots of Jules Verne , and an incredibly large amount of Lois McMaster Bujold 's novels .
( Somebody at NASA must be a fan . )
There 's also an inexplicably large number of the Xanth books by Piers Anthony , in case you need to jumpstart your 13 - year - old humor glands while in orbit .

But I 'm still reeling over the Trek miscalculation .
What is happening to the U.S. government ?
And by extension , to the INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY on board the ISS ?
Really , I am in shock .
I hope the guys over at TrekMovie can explain this because I can't .

T HE O RIGINS OF THE P RACTICE OF
R OUTINE M ALE C IRCUMCISION
The Significance of Circumcision
Partial circumcision is the oldest culturally practised routine operation .
This operation is the foundation stone of surgical tradition in Western medicine .
Consider the cultural importance of circumcision from the point of view of medical development in Western cultures .
Compare this with traditional chinese medicine which never uses surgery and never practiced circumcision .
THE BASIC RIDDLE
The Encyclopaedia Britannica describes how : " The origin of the practice is unknown . . the quite widely preferred early use of a stone knife rather than a metal one suggest the great antiquity of the operation " ( 34 ) .
It is generally acknowledged that routine circumcision originated among the hunting tribes in the late stone age previous to the beginning of cultivation .
This dates the origin of the practice between 12,000 and 50,000 years old .
It has often been suggested to me that the Jews must know why they circumcise .
The Encyclopaedia Judaica itself states that " its origin is shrouded in mystery " ( 33 ) .
The operation originated in pre-literate times , the Biblical tradition is a relatively late development .
No culture which performs the rite traditionally can state the origins of the custom in any way which explains it to the scientific thinker .
It would be more than a little naive to imagine that our Stone Age ancestors were chaotic barbarians , such a common custom must have an intelligence , or at least a sense in it .
The modern anthropologist regards circumcision as an unsolvable mystery .
Modern theories assume that the practice was based on a number of combined factors .
Phimosis was refuted because a ) the natural peoples did not appreciate the association between the penis , semen and fertility ( anthropologists assumed that the problem with phimosis is that it hinders semen emission ) and b ) phimosis is thought to be a rarity , however this opinion was established previous to any statistical studies .
Modern writers never mention phimosis .
Since 1960 any discussion of phimosis as origin for circumcision has vanished from the books . -
( The ommission by Bettelheim and Eliade`s Encyclopedia of Religion being notable recent examples ) .
The Independant Origins
Though the operation sometimes spread , part of the puzzle is the independent origination of the practice in a great number of completely separate areas of the world .
Added to which there are a great variety of ancient methods used to free the glans from the enclosing foreskin .
see Ancient Methods of Genital Modification For Detailed Background Information General background literature see Advised Anthropological Literature Phimosis Through the Ages : An index and general summary of the anthropological texts which mention phimosis .
Phimotic Discussions is a discussion of Ploss and Bryk , and summarises how phimosis was discussed and rejected .
The files Ploss and Bryk give the central relevant quotes and references in detail .
This is backed up by the original texts and new thoroughly checked accurate translations of Ploss and Bryk See Chinese Medicine which never uses surgery and never practiced circumcision ..
The Origins of Routine Male Circumcision - 2 of 5
Hybrids may be tops when it comes to saving gasoline , but they ’re far from the best choice for budget - conscious car buyers , a new study says .
The four - door hatchback Chevy Aveo from General Motors Corp. leads the ranking of the best new - car values in terms of “ total ownership cost ” as calculated by automotive data firm Edmunds.com , based on $ 5 - a - gallon gas .
The highest - ranked hybrid was the Honda Civic at No. 10 .
The Toyota Prius hybrid -- No. 1 in the government ’s fuel economy rankings -- came in 26th .
Hybrids , which are powered by both an electric motor and a gasoline engine , typically get better gas mileage than their non -hybrid counterparts but carry higher price tags .
A 2008 Aveo hatchback with manual transmission lists for $ 10,235 and is rated by the Environmental Protection Agency at 27 miles per gallon in combined city - highway driving .
The Prius , by contrast , has a combined fuel economy of 46 mpg and a suggested retail price of $ 21,500 -- and typically sells for thousands of dollars above that because of high demand .
The study ’s purpose “ is n’t to discourage people from buying hybrids , ” said Jesse Toprak , head of industry analysis for Santa Monica - based Edmunds.com .
However , “ consumers ought to consider regular - engine small cars if their goal is just to save money . ”
The Edmunds.com findings are at odds with a recent analysis by Consumer Reports , which ranked both the Prius and the Civic hybrids among the 10 cars that the offer “ the best fuel economy for the buck . ”
Consumer Reports only included vehicles that get its “ recommended ” rating , which is based on reliability , safety , handling and other factors in addition to sales price and fuel economy .
That ’s part of the reason the Aveo and the Toyota Yaris did n’t make Consumer Reports ’ fuel - economy cut .
“ We did n’t want to send people to cars that are going to let them down in other areas , ” said Rik Paul , the magazine ’s auto editor .
One car - shopping strategy that ’s almost certain not to make sense financially is to trade in a late - model sport utility vehicle or pickup truck for a smaller , more fuel - efficient vehicle .
Because of plummeting demand , trade - in values on these gas guzzlers have been falling fast -- some dealers wo n’t accept them at all -- and that can wipe out the gas savings achieved by switching to a smaller car , auto research firm Kelley Blue Book Co. said in a report last month .
Toprak noted that many people buy hybrids because of the cars ’ environmentally friendly image or other reasons unrelated to economics .
“ At least 50 % of all automotive purchases are not based on financial considerations , ” he said .
“ Its a very emotional purchase that does n’t always involve numbers . ”

Driving less , switching to a hybrid or ditching the car entirely are sure - fire ways to reduce your carbon footprint .
Barring that , there 's something cheap and easy you can do to help cut global CO2 emissions by more than 42 million tons .
Make sure your tires are properly inflated .
Everyone knows under - inflated tires decrease safety and increase fuel consumption , but they also may help create almost as much carbon dioxide as Connecticut emits each year .
Huh ?
An analysis by Bridgestone Europe of 20,300 passenger cars in the European Union found 93.5 percent had under - inflated tires .
Softer tires increase rolling resistance , forcing the engine to work harder - and burn more fuel .
The U.S. Department of Transportation says being down just 5 to 7 pounds per square inch can decrease fuel economy by two to three miles per gallon .
The number - crunchers at Bridgestone figure all of those cars with under - inflated tires are burning an additional 2.14 billion - with a ' b ' - gallons of fuel per year - and generating an additional 18.4 million tons of carbon dioxide .
That 's almost as much as Delaware emits in a year .
We did a little back - of - the - envelope math to see what that might mean on a global scale .
There are about 600 million cars in the world , so you 're looking at an additional 42.32 million tons of carbon dioxide generated by under - inflated tires , or slightly less than Connecticut emitted in 2005 .
Granted , that 's by no means a scientific figure .
But it gives you a sense of what might be accomplished if everyone took five or 10 minutes a month to check their tires .
Do n't know how ?
Check this out .

After news broke that Mrs. Clinton had lent her campaign $ 5 million following the crush of states that voted on Feb.
5 , the campaign brought in more than $ 4 million in 24 hours ; and after Mrs. Clinton ’s popular - vote victories in Ohio and Texas on March 4 , the campaign collected more than $ 3 million .
The Obama campaign often averaged more than $ 1 million a day online earlier in the year .

Nevertheless , Mr. Nemazee said that $ 1 million at this point in the race was an impressive total for Mrs. Clinton to have raised .
“ We raised a million dollars in a 24 - hour period for a candidate that every pundit is saying is either toast or dead on arrival , ” he said .
“ People at the grass roots are still willing to spend $ 5 , $ 25 , $ 50 , whatever it is , to be supportive . ”
Mr. Nemazee also said that the fund - raiser in Washington on Wednesday , which had been expected to bring in $ 500,000 , had actually raised more than $ 1 million .
He added that a Mother ’s Day - theme event on Saturday in New York with Mrs. Clinton and her daughter , Chelsea , was on track to bring in more than $ 200,000 .
“ That is not indicative to me of a lack of support , ” Mr. Nemazee said .
“ We ’re in the 16th month of the campaign for a candidate that everyone says has no path to victory . ”
Still , other top fund - raisers working for Mrs. Clinton said that enthusiasm among donors had fallen sharply and that they had little confidence there would be a financial turnaround .
They said that some donors had questioned why they should give more money when another set of numbers  the calculus to win enough delegates for the nomination  seemed so against Mrs. Clinton at this point .
At the end of March , the most recent period for which figures are available , Mrs. Clinton had $ 9 million available for her primary bid , compared with $ 43 million raised in primary money for Mr. Obama .
Mr. Obama also had less than $ 1 million in debt .
The U.S. should aim for 100 M bps ( bits per second ) of broadband available to all U.S. residents by 2012 and 1 Gbps by 2015 in order to catch up to other countries that are moving forward with broadband rollouts , recommends a study released Monday .
The study , by the Baller Herbst Law Group of Washington , D.C. , also calls on the U.S. to create a national broadband strategy that helps state programs bring broadband to underserved areas .
Neither private industry nor government programs alone can build the broadband networks needed for the U.S. to compete globally in the coming years , said Jim Baller , founder of Baller Herbst and the study ’s co-author .
The e-NC Authority , a state program in North Carolina focused on broadband rollout , commissioned the study , and many of Baller ’s recommendations are focused on how North Carolina can get broadband to the 16 percent of the state ’s residents who do n’t yet have it .
Among the recommendations : Grants to broadband providers , communities working together to finance broadband networks and funding for new broadband competitors .
Several speakers at a forum accompanying the study ’s release said other states can learn from North Carolina ’s broadband efforts .
The state has used a combination of state , nonprofit and other funding to bring broadband to its rural areas , and in January , it awarded a $ 1.2 million grant to help bring broadband to four rural counties .
But speakers at Monday ’s event said the U.S. government needs to step forward and help bring broadband to rural areas across the nation .
Michael Calabrese , director of the Wireless Future Program at the New America Foundation , compared broadband to electricity or telephony of the last century .
Broadband is the “ essential public infrastructure of the 21st century , ” he said .
The White House needs a broadband czar who coordinates how government agencies are promoting broadband , added Michael Copps , a member of the Federal Communications Commission .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development should require broadband hookups in all new public housing projects , and other agencies should work with local schools and libraries to extend their Internet access out into the community using wireless networks , he said .
Countries such as Japan and South Korea have faster broadband available for cheaper prices than in the U.S. , and residents in those countries have an advantage over U.S. residents , speakers said .
“ Broadband is a revolution , ” Copps said .
“ Revolutions have winners , and revolutions have losers . ”
The average download speed among consumer broadband services in the U.S. is 8.9 M bps , slower than average speeds in 18 other OECD countries , according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .
Japan ’s average download speed is more than 10 times faster , at 93.7 Mbps , while France ’s is 44.2 Mbps and South Korea ’s is 43.3 Mbps , according to OECD numbers .
Some people will dispute that the U.S. needs 100 M bps or 1 Gbps , as the study calls for , Baller said .
“ Great nations build key infrastructure with a lot of headroom , ” he said .
“ They do what it takes to be great and stay great . ”
Broadband can improve the economy in rural areas , bringing jobs that might otherwise be outsourced overseas , added Jonathan Adelstein , also an FCC member .
Broadband can enable telecommuting , which is good for the environment , and it can help police and fire departments better communicate with each other , he added .
While the speakers at the event all called for a national broadband policy , some groups have questioned the need for major changes .
Denny Strigl , Verizon Communication ’s president and chief operating officer , said OECD statistics showing the U.S. 15th out of 30 member nations in broadband penetration are misleading , partly because it fails to factor in population density .
The U.S. has the most broadband customers of any nation , and U.S. customers have more choice of providers than residents of most other countries , wrote Eric Rabe , Verizon ’s senior vice president for media relations in a blog post this month .
A World Economic Forum study says the U.S. has the best Internet infrastructure , he added .
“ While it has n’t quite achieved the notoriety of an urban myth , it ’s become commonplace to read that the United States lags other countries when it comes to broadband service , ” Rabe wrote on the Verizon Policy Blog .
“ It ’s time to put the myth of U.S. broadband inferiority to rest . ”
Data versioning
Here 's a realtively simple way to implement data versioning in a database , in a way that should be scalable as well .
It only needs a couple of support tables and a single function and can apply versioning across multiple data sets concurrently .
It also supports branching and tagging using a natural model .
I got started thinking about this to implement undo in a structured Orbat editor , particularly in a multi-user context , but I refined it while researching ideas for a content management system .
So the main example below is for a content management system which uses generic data containers rather than specific rows - but more complicated rows can also be accomodated storing any type of data .
The problem
Storing multiple versions of data records
Viewing a data - set at a given time with transactional integrity - snapshots
Branching and tagging
Merging
Tables
All examples are for PostgreSQL
revision table
There is a single global revision table - it stores all revision information including branches and tags .
It can also be used to store per-revision meta - data such as author and creation time .
create table rev ( id serial not null primary key , branchid int not null references rev( id ) , name text , author text , ctime text , constraint rev_name_uc unique ( name ) ) ; create index rev_branchid_idx on rev( branchid ) ;
The root of the tree has an entry with id = branchid =
0 . Revisions then strictly increase for every change to any data set .
Because of this , in a real - world example you would probably use a bigserial for the primary key and bigint for the branchid .
Branches are specified by simply setting the branchid to a non-zero value , and multiple branches created in the same way .
In this code branches and tags are the same thing - they both occur on the branch above the branch data , but it they could be specified in different ways using the same data structures .
Example :
revision branch tag description / path to version 0 0 trunk 0 , root of the tree 1 0 0.1 2 0 abranch 0.2 , root of ' abranch ' 3 2 0.2.1 4 0 0.3 5 2 aabranch 0.2.2 , root of ' aabranch ' , off ' abranch ' 6 5 0.2.2.1
entry table
The entry table is n't necessary if immutable meta - data is n't required , it could be replaced by a simple sequence , but it helps bind everything together with foreign keys if nothing else .
create table entry ( id serial not null primary key , revid int not null references rev( id ) , classid int ) ;
In this example , we have the initial revision revid of the item , and a classid - some type identifier for an otherwise generic data item , for example whether it is a blog post or a news item in a cms .
Other meta - data could include the owner - the creator is specified in the revision table .
data table
The data is stored in a data table which stores an entryid and a revid for each content record .
create table data ( id serial primary key , entryid int not null references entry ( id ) , revid int not null references rev( id ) , content text , constraint data_uc unique ( entryid , revid ) ) ; create index data_entryid_idx on data( entryid ) ; create index data_revid_idx on data( revid ) ;
Each revision has complete stand - alone content - no backward diffs or antything tricky .
This just simplifies things a lot and speeds up most operations at the expense of disk space .
The explicit indices may not be required due to fact the unique constraint will create an index over the same terms .
function : branch_table
Only one function is required , and it is used to help when looking up branch information .
Because the revision tree is stored as a flat table , this function is required to translate this into a more database - friendly format for queries .
This is really the secret sauce which makes any of this work .
create type branch_range as ( id int , branchid int , lo int , hi int ) ; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION branch_table ( ibranchid int ) RETURNS setof branch_range AS $ BODY $ -- returns ranges of values for a branch declare res branch_range ; begin res.branchid := ibranchid ; res.id := ibranchid ; res.hi := 2147483647 ; -- ' max int ' res.lo := ibranchid ; return next res ; while ( res.branchid <> 0 ) loop res.branchid := branchid from rev where id=res.
branchid ; res.hi = res.lo ; res.lo = res.branchid ; return next res ; end loop ; end ; $ BODY $ LANGUAGE ' plpgsql ' STABLE ;
Given a branchid this will spit out a table of ranges of revisions that can be used to find members of the branch .
It relies on the fact that revisions are monotonically increasing across all branches .
If the branchid matches
then this revision is in the branch
otherwise check the next highest branch , but only if the revision is less than our branchpoint
repeat .
Once you have the table above , the following SQL will list all revisions which belong to the branch .
This can easily use indices and so will scale very well .
select * from rev, branch_table ( < branchid > ) as b where rev.branchid = b.branchid and rev.id >= b.lo and rev.id <= b.hi order by rev.id ;
This function and the query above are impacted by the branch / tag mechanism used .
Operations
Ok that 's the data structures out of the way , how is it used ?
Creating a new item
Within the same transaction , the following operations need to be carried out :
Allocate and insert a new revision entry into the rev table .
Allocate and insert a new entry into the entry table with the new revision .
Insert a new record into the data table with the new entryid and revision .
Steps 2 and 3 could be repeated to add as many items as required so they are all associated atomically with the same revision .
The additions could also span mutliple tables and data types .
Creating a new revision
Within the same transaction , the following operations need to be carried out :
Allocate an insert a new revision entry into the rev table .
Insert a new record into the data table with the same entryid as the old one , but with a new revision and data .
Again , step 2 can be repeated for however many data items are changing in this revision .
Note that each revision is complete and stand - alone .
Not having to generate or apply backward diffs makes this process much simpler at the cost of some data space .
Adding to a branch is as simple as setting the branchid in the new revision .
Creating a branch or tag
Tags and branches are the same thing .
A new revision is created and the name is set to some non -null unique value .
Or the name field can be set on an existing revision .
Branches only become branches once a new revision is added to the tag revision .
Because of this it might be an idea to always require an empty new revision for every branch , that way there is no ambuguity about whether to include the data at the specific revision of the branch on the trunk and / or the branch .
An alternative and equally valid way to implement it would be to make branches new revisions which are already split from the trunk above .
In this case you would create a new revision with the name set to the branch name , and the branchid set to the revision id of the parent trunk .
This makes the branching more explicit - but I think the distinction is unecessary .
Note how this is a simple insert on a tiny table .
Branching is for all intents , free .
Finding the latest content of an item on a given branch
Assuming some mechanism to find the entryid and branchid , the following query can find the latest content for that entry on that branch .
Note that this assumes that data.id is monotonically increasing with the revision number , if that is not the case , then the version needs to be looked up separately first and the query gets a little more complicated ( and I wo n't cover it here ) .
select data .* from data where id = ( select max ( data.id ) from branch_table ( < branchid > ) as b join rev on rev.branchid = b.branchid and rev.id >= b.lo and rev.id <= b.hi join data on data . revid = rev.id and data. entryid = < entryid > ) ;
Finding all latest content on a given branch
Assuming some mechanism to find the branchid , the following query can find the latest content for all items currently live on the given branch .
It is a small change ( see change bars ) .
select entry .* , data .* from data join entry on entry .id = data.
entryid | where id in ( select max ( data.id ) from branch_table ( < branchid > ) as b join rev on rev.branchid = b.branchid and rev.id >= b.lo and rev.id <= b.hi join data on data . revid = rev.id | group by data.entryid ) ;
Finding all content for a specific ( tagged ) version
If a tag is just an empty branch , then the previous will work fine .
Otherwise you need slight modification to the query to limit the results ( see the ' change bar ' below ) .
The same query is used to find the root of a branch which is implicitly tagged automatically .
select entry .* , data .* from data join entry on entry .id = data.
entryid where id in ( select max ( data.id ) from branch_table ( < tagid > ) as b join rev on rev.branchid = b.branchid and rev.id >= b.lo and rev.id <= b.hi | and rev.id <= < tagid > join data on data . revid = rev.id and data. entryid = < entryid > group by data.entryid ) ;
Enhancements
Mutable Meta-data
Since the revision table is global and can thus be used to version different tables , each type of mutable data could be stored in it 's own table .
This would reduce any redundant copies of the data being stored when they do n't change , at the expense of the overhead of having to perform branch matching separately on each table lookup .
It might be useful to seprate meta -data and content at least , if the meta - data is likely to change often and / or independently of the content .
User Supplied Keys
If there is some sort of user - supplied key , such as a ' node name ' or ' filename ' , which can be changed over time , then some extra work is required to make sure it remains unique on each branch .
You cannot just use a unique constraint on the key , as you can and will have the same name on different branches .
And you can't just have it on the key : branch ether , since names could come and go in an interleaved fashion .
Multiple tags
The mechanism presented does n't allow multiple tags for the same revision .
Since revisions are global and cheap , a new tag can be added to the head revision ( of a given branch ) by simply adding a new revision entry .
For older revisions you could simply create a new empty revision and set the branchid to the revision of the conflicting tag .
Deleting
With no other mutable - meta - data mechanism , you could store a new NULL data record .
If you had meta - data it could go there somewhere .
Merging
Merging of branches is a pretty important feature , but most of the mechanics are beyond the mere versioning issues .
What is n't is tracking the merges that have taken place rather than forcing the user to use manual tagging or write numbers down .
Perhaps an additional column or two could be added to track the merge operations in a graph .
Given that revisions are global , a simple graph would cover whole branch merges or single file merges using the same logic .
The basic merge operation works something like this :
For each item which has changed in the source branch / timespan Load the item 's latest content from the source branch
Load the item 's latest content from the target branch
Load the item 's content from the branch point ( or from the last merged point )
Perform a 3 - way merge using diff3
If there are no conflicts , save the new revision .
If there are conflicts , force the user to fix them up first .
For each item which is new in the source branch / timespan Copy it over
Note that new items are copied over - you endup with a redundant copy of the data .
This could be addressed by allowing multiple versions for each data item , but you would need another table to store that information .
A web - based CMS system provides some challenges here - you do n't want to force the user to edit every item separately in one go , and the operation needs to run atomically .
One way around this is probably to write conflicted entries to a new branch off the target branch , and let them fix it up , and repeat until done .
Concurrent Edits
This occurs when different sessions edit the same item and try to store them again on the same branch .
This is mostly just the merging problem on single files .
One way to implement it in a scalable way would be to use a temporary branch ...
Temporary branches
For a web - based system you may want to keep storing mutliple revisions as the user saves draft copies , allowing powerful undo and review features .
Each edit could create a per-user branch which keeps being added to as the session progresses .
Once the draft is complete and ready for saving , you could just perform a merge of the temporary branch the same as for any other branch , and then delete the whole lot .
Actually it could probably be quite easily extended to allow edits of multiple items which are then stored concurrently .
Lightweight copies
Copies across branches are just that - copies .
A lightweight copy could be implemented fairly simply by just allowing multiple revisions on data items .
It would require an extra level of indirection through an association table , so adds more complexity to the queries ( but not much ) .
Remove the revid from the data table , and create something like the following :
create table data_rev ( dataid int not null references data( id ) , revid int not null references rev( id ) , constraint data_rev_uc unique ( dataid , revid ) ) ;
McCain has done little to capture media attention on weekends for nearly five months .
John McCain does n't work weekends
Since effectively capturing the Republican nomination when Mitt Romney dropped out of the race on Feb.
7 , John McCain has held just one public campaign event on a weekend .
Instead , after workweeks full of fundraisers , town hall meetings and interviews , McCain has been , in campaign parlance , “ down ” on nearly every Saturday or Sunday for 20 weeks , largely sequestered away from the news media .

He ’s usually spending time with family , friends and campaign advisers at residences in Arlington , Va. , and Phoenix or vacation homes near Sedona , Ariz . , and San Diego .
That is n't to say McCain is kicking back and relaxing every weekend .
He ’s hosted reporters and donors on separate occasions at his Arizona cabin , done a guest turn on " Saturday Night Live " and visited troops in both Iraq and at Walter Reed hospital .
Yet aside from an April rally on the steps of the courthouse in Prescott , Ariz. , McCain has done little to capture media attention on weekends for nearly five months .
McCain aides say that they made a conscious decision after it became clear that they had won the nomination to use weekends primarily to return their candidate to his preferred surroundings in Arizona and to have him rest , bone up on policy , and meet privately with aides , advisers , contributors and other prominent officials .
And , they contend , there was little chance anyway of getting much exposure on the weekends in the face of the other contest that dominated the news in recent months .
“ For a huge part of that time there was a Democratic primary going on , ” notes spokesman Brian Rogers .
“ And we felt like we could get done what we needed to do [ publicly ] during the week . ”
Another McCain aide dismissed the weekend downtime decision as “ an insider thing . ”
“ I do n’t think [ voters ] are going to be logging the hours , ” the aide said .
McCain officials note that he ’ll campaign on weekends for much of the summer and point to a speech he ’s giving Saturday in Washington to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials and a fundraiser in Kentucky later that day .
When informed of McCain ’s absence of public weekend campaign events , Barack Obama spokesman Bill Burton responded by sending a list of all the appearances his candidate had made on weekends in June alone ( seven , including this coming weekend ) .
McCain ’s habit of weekends off is recognized by his small band of beat reporters , who are pleased by their good fortune but nevertheless find it puzzling .
Yet for insiders who follow the campaign closely , his streak has become increasingly tough to overlook .
As with so many issues surrounding his bid , McCain ’s schedule is a sensitive topic because it is unavoidably suffused with the looming question of his age .
In trying to answer skeptics who ask whether a 72 - year - old has the vigor to hold the presidency , McCain points to his indisputably packed calendar — on weekdays , that is .
" Watch me campaign , " he said in April , when asked about the matter at a conference of media executives in Washington .
" Come on the bus again , my friends , all of you . "
Yet at the same time , his aides do n’t want to wear him out and risk raising fears about his age by pushing him so much so that he gets sick .
Last month , campaign staffers at his headquarters sought to give him an entire Friday free of public events , citing a cold as the reasoning for scrapping the day ’s schedule .
But when McCain got wind of the plan , he rebelled and forced his aides to schedule a news conference .
Political veterans said McCain ’s decision to forgo stumping on the weekends had both merits and flaws .
" This statistic will generate further questions about how well McCain has used the gift of three and a half months this spring when he was clearly the GOP choice , while Obama and [ Hillary Rodham ]
Clinton were still slugging it out , ” said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato .
“ Judging by the polls , McCain 's critics have a point when they say he could have done a lot more to frame the election .
At the same time , I think that point is exaggerated because the atmospherics are so bad for any Republican right now .
McCain could have exhausted himself and still not had much to show for it . ”
And Sabato recalled that when Ronald Reagan ran at age 69 in 1980 , he was “ carefully paced . ”
Ed Rollins , who ran Reagan ’s 1984 reelection , noted that aides rested the incumbent and did n’t overload his schedule .
“ We did n’t do 10 events a day — we did two or three , ” said Rollins .
But Rollins said McCain had missed an opportunity by not getting on the trail on weekends since February .
First , he pointed out , it ’s easier to draw a larger crowd when people are n’t at work .
And , despite the historic Democratic primary , he said McCain could have made a splash by going into less - populated areas .
“ You ’ve got to think beyond big news cycles and big media outlets , ” he said .
“ The smaller market is where he [ would have been ] a big show . ”
Given the lack of intensity of support for McCain in the Republican base , Rollins said weekends could have been an optimal time “ to rejuvenate them . ”
But Scott Reed , who helmed Bob Dole ’s 1996 campaign , argued that the McCain campaign was smart to recognize that a presidential run is a marathon , not a sprint .
“ It does no good to run the guy into the dirt , ” Reed said .
“ He ’s already faced with the age and health issue , and the last thing they need to do is have him catch a cold . ”
Heading into a compressed general election season , they need the candidate at his freshest .
“ The worst thing they can do for McCain is run him ragged , ” Reed said .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Inflating our way out of trouble is tempting but it ’s another buy now , pay later strategy , both for the economy and investors .
Inflationary pressure is building globally , and consumers ’ expectations of future price rises are growing in a way reminiscent of the 1970s , pushed by surging commodity and energy prices and at least partly underwritten by U.S. interest rates designed to rescue a country experiencing a popping debt bubble .
In the year through March , overall U.S. consumer inflation rose by 4.0 percent , well above the Federal Reserve ’s comfort zone , though the core measure excluding food and energy on which the Fed traditionally concentrates rose only 2.4 percent .
More to the point , inflation expectations are hardening .
Consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan now expect prices to rise 4.3 percent in the next year .
From one perspective a bout of inflation is just what the doctor ordered : it will make paying back or writing off all those unwise loans far easier .
“ America is a country that owes money .
It is natural when you are a debtor that you lean in the direction of inflation , because it makes paying it back so much easier , ” said Philippa Malmgren , a former economic advisor to the current Bush administration who is now president of the Canonbury Group , a policy and political risk consultancy based in London .
Seems simple : rather than cutting consumption and upping savings , thereby touching off a nasty recession , let inflation do its magic and watch the debts melt away .
But though inflation may be an easier sell to America ’s voters , if not its creditors , make no mistake : it is toxic to investors , makes overall economic growth structurally lower , and ultimately is likely to boil over .
“ There are terrible costs associated with inflation , but all the costs are later , ” said Malmgren .
The Fed has slashed rates to 2.0 percent from 5.25 since last September , though investors are now betting that rates stay on hold for several months and may next rise .
Tim Bond , global head of asset allocation at Barclays Capital in London , sees a possibility of higher inflation becoming entrenched in the United States and ultimately ending with a deep “ policy recession ” in several years ’ time , when the Fed is forced to raise rates and stomp on growth and employment in order to rein in price rises .
So , how bad would inflation be for investors ?
Pretty bad .
From the end of 1969 to the end of 1979 the average annualized total return after inflation was minus 0.9 percent for U.S. stocks , according to Barclays , and a loss of 1.6 percent yearly for bonds .
DURING INFLATION , BUY THINGS THAT INFLATE
Bond has looked in detail at the way the 1970s played out for investors , and though he thinks this time might be slightly different , the message is clear : put your money in assets whose yields can reset rapidly to keep pace with inflation .
“ If you have the freedom , you go for cash , ” he said .
“ Both bond yields and equity yields are going to go up .
But otherwise you go in with more of an equity tilt than a bond tilt . ”
What tends to happen is that company earnings actually outpace inflation , as firms successfully force high prices onto their customers , but those earnings also become much more volatile .
Basically , inflation makes planning hellish , and investors are far less willing to put big valuations on volatile instruments .
So in other words , if we are seeing the end of the “ great moderation ” of low inflation and stable economic growth , we might well see with it a fundamental shift in what people will pay for stocks and the earnings they represent .
Bond also found that profit growth was concentrated in the businesses involved in the sectors that are causing the inflation .
For example , in Britain from 1970 to 1980 the standout was the oil and gas sector , which saw annual real profit growth of 6.8 percent and a return over inflation of 1.9 percent a year .
That logic would extend now beyond oil and gas to other companies enjoying surges in the prices of their products .
You may also be able to make a pretty good case during bouts of inflation for taking the extra interest corporate debt pays over government issues .
Corporations would see their debt inflate from under them , and also might be expected to see fairly good earnings growth .
And in the 1970s in the United States , defaults on speculative debt were fairly low by historic standards .
But how will the people who lent all that money to the U.S. and its citizens react to having their loans inflated away ?
It ’s possible they will accept it meekly , if it ’s seen as a way of maintaining U.S. consumer demand for their products , be it oil or manufactured goods .
It is also possible of course that they react by putting their money elsewhere .
The United States is in a better position than most to pull it off , but it is a strategy that is not without risk , to put it mildly .

McClellan says the administration relied on \ " propaganda\ " to sell the war .
Exclusive : McClellan whacks Bush , White House
Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan writes in a surprisingly scathing memoir to be published next week that President Bush “ veered terribly off course , ” was not “ open and forthright on Iraq , ” and took a “ permanent campaign approach ” to governing at the expense of candor and competence .
Among the most explosive revelations in the 341 - page book , titled “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception ” ( Public Affairs , $ 27.95 ) :
Advertisement
• McClellan charges that Bush relied on “ propaganda ” to sell the war .
• He says the White House press corps was too easy on the administration during the run-up to the war .
• He admits that some of his own assertions from the briefing room podium turned out to be “ badly misguided . ”
• The longtime Bush loyalist also suggests that two top aides held a secret West Wing meeting to get their story straight about the CIA leak case at a time when federal prosecutors were after them — and McClellan was continuing to defend them despite mounting evidence they had not given him all the facts .
• McClellan asserts that the aides — Karl Rove , the president ’s senior adviser , and I . Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , the vice president ’s chief of staff — “ had at best misled ” him about their role in the disclosure of former CIA operative Valerie Plame ’s identity .
A few reporters were offered advance copies of the book , with the restriction that their stories not appear until Sunday , the day before the official publication date .
Politico declined and purchased “ What Happened ” at a Washington bookstore .
The eagerly awaited book , while recounting many fond memories of Bush and describing him as “ authentic ” and “ sincere , ” is harsher than reporters and White House officials had expected .
McClellan was one of the president ’s earliest and most loyal political aides , and most of his friends had expected him to take a few swipes at his former colleague in order to sell books but also to paint a largely affectionate portrait .
Instead , McClellan ’s tone is often harsh .
He writes , for example , that after Hurricane Katrina , the White House “ spent most of the first week in a state of denial , ” and he blames Rove for suggesting the photo of the president comfortably observing the disaster during an Air Force One flyover .
McClellan says he and counselor to the president Dan Bartlett had opposed the idea and thought it had been scrapped .
But he writes that he later was told that “ Karl was convinced we needed to do it — and the president agreed . ”
“ One of the worst disasters in our nation ’s history became one of the biggest disasters in Bush ’s presidency .
Katrina and the botched federal response to it would largely come to define Bush ’s second term , ” he writes .
“ And the perception of this catastrophe was made worse by previous decisions President Bush had made , including , first and foremost , the failure to be open and forthright on Iraq and rushing to war with inadequate planning and preparation for its aftermath . ”
McClellan , who turned 40 in February , was press secretary from July 2003 to April 2006 .
An Austin native from a political family , he began working as a gubernatorial spokesman for then - Gov .
Bush in early 1999 , was traveling press secretary for the Bush - Cheney 2000 campaign and was chief deputy to Press Secretary Ari Fleischer at the beginning of Bush ’s first term .
“ I still like and admire President Bush , ” McClellan writes .
“ But he and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war .
…
In this regard , he was terribly ill - served by his top advisers , especially those involved directly in national security . ”
In a small sign of how thoroughly McClellan has adopted the outsider ’s role , he refers at times to his former boss as “ Bush , ” when he is universally referred to by insiders as “ the president . ”
McClellan lost some of his friends in the administration last November when his publisher released an excerpt from the book that appeared to accuse Bush of participating in the cover - up of the Plame leak .
The book , however , makes clear that McClellan believes Bush was also a victim of misinformation .
The book begins with McClellan ’s statement to the press that he had talked with Rove and Libby and that they had assured him they “ were not involved in … the leaking of classified information . ”
At Libby ’s trial , testimony showed the two had talked with reporters about the officer , however elliptically .
“ I had allowed myself to be deceived into unknowingly passing along a falsehood , ” McClellan writes .
“ It would ultimately prove fatal to my ability to serve the president effectively .
I did n’t learn that what I ’d said was untrue until the media began to figure it out almost two years later .
“ Neither , I believe , did President Bush .
He , too , had been deceived and therefore became unwittingly involved in deceiving me .
But the top White House officials who knew the truth — including Rove , Libby and possibly Vice President Cheney — allowed me , even encouraged me , to repeat a lie . ”
McClellan also suggests that Libby and Rove secretly colluded to get their stories straight at a time when federal investigators were hot on the Plame case .
“ There is only one moment during the leak episode that I am reluctant to discuss , ” he writes .
“ It was in 2005 , during a time when attention was focusing on Rove and Libby , and it sticks vividly in my mind .
…
Following [ a meeting in Chief of Staff Andy Card ’s office ] , … Scooter Libby was walking to the entryway as he prepared to depart when Karl turned to get his attention .
‘ You have time to visit ? ’
Karl asked .
‘ Yeah , ’ replied Libby .
“ I have no idea what they discussed , but it seemed suspicious for these two , whom I had never noticed spending any one - on - one time together , to go behind closed doors and visit privately .
…
At least one of them , Rove , it was publicly known at the time , had at best misled me by not sharing relevant information , and credible rumors were spreading that the other , Libby , had done at least as much . …
“ The confidential meeting also occurred at a moment when I was being battered by the press for publicly vouching for the two by claiming they were not involved in leaking Plame ’s identity , when recently revealed information was now indicating otherwise .
…
I do n’t know what they discussed , but what would any knowledgeable person reasonably and logically conclude was the topic ?
Like the whole truth of people ’s involvement , we will likely never know with any degree of confidence . ”
McClellan repeatedly embraces the rhetoric of Bush 's liberal critics and even charges : “ If anything , the national press corps was probably too deferential to the White House and to the administration in regard to the most important decision facing the nation during my years in Washington , the choice over whether to go to war in Iraq .
“ The collapse of the administration ’s rationales for war , which became apparent months after our invasion , should never have come as such a surprise . …
In this case , the ‘ liberal media ’ did n’t live up to its reputation .
If it had , the country would have been better served . ”
Decrying the Bush administration ’s “ excessive embrace of the permanent campaign approach to governance , ” McClellan recommends that future presidents appoint a “ deputy chief of staff for governing ” who “ would be responsible for making sure the president is continually and consistently committed to a high level of openness and forthrightness and transcending partisanship to achieve unity .
“ I frequently stumbled along the way , ” McClellan acknowledges in the book ’s preface .
“ My own story , however , is of small importance in the broad historical picture .
More significant is the larger story in which I played a minor role : the story of how the presidency of George W. Bush veered terribly off course . ”
Even some of the chapter titles are brutal : “ The Permanent Campaign , ” “ Deniability , ” “ Triumph and Illusion , ” “ Revelation and Humiliation ” and “ Out of Touch . ”
“ I think the concern about liberal bias helps to explain the tendency of the Bush team to build walls against the media , ” McClellan writes in a chapter in which he says he dealt “ happily enough ” with liberal reporters .
“ Unfortunately , the press secretary at times found himself outside those walls as well . ”
The book ’s center has eight slick pages with 19 photos , eight of them depicting McClellan with the president .
Those making cameos include Cheney , Rove , Bartlett , Mark Knoller of CBS News , former Assistant Press Secretary Reed Dickens and , aboard Air Force One , former press office official Peter Watkins and former White House stenographer Greg North .
In the acknowledgments , McClellan thanks each member of his former staff by name .
Among other notable passages :
• Steve Hadley , then the deputy national security adviser , said about the erroneous assertion about Saddam Hussein seeking uranium , included in the State of the Union address of 2003 : “ Signing off on these facts is my responsibility .
…
And in this case , I blew it .
I think the only solution is for me to resign . ”
The offer “ was rejected almost out of hand by others present , ” McClellan writes .
• Bush was “ clearly irritated , … steamed , ” when McClellan informed him that chief economic adviser Larry Lindsey had told The Wall Street Journal that a possible war in Iraq could cost from $ 100 billion to $ 200 billion : “ ‘ It ’s unacceptable , ’ Bush continued , his voice rising .
‘ He should n’t be talking about that . ’ ”
• “ As press secretary , I spent countless hours defending the administration from the podium in the White House briefing room .
Although the things I said then were sincere , I have since come to realize that some of them were badly misguided . ”
• “ History appears poised to confirm what most Americans today have decided : that the decision to invade Iraq was a serious strategic blunder .
No one , including me , can know with absolute certainty how the war will be viewed decades from now when we can more fully understand its impact .
What I do know is that war should only be waged when necessary , and the Iraq war was not necessary . ”
• McClellan describes his preparation for briefing reporters during the Plame frenzy : “ I could feel the adrenaline flowing as I gave the go - ahead for Josh Deckard , one of my hard - working , underpaid press office staff , … to give the two - minute warning so the networks could prepare to switch to live coverage the moment I stepped into the briefing room . ”
• “ ‘ Matrix ’ was the code name the Secret Service used for the White House press secretary . "
McClellan is on the lecture circuit and remains in the Washington area with his wife , Jill .
ATLANTA  Apparently eight million gallons of water and 80,000 animals were not enough for the Georgia Aquarium , which already claims to be the world ’s largest .
It did not have dolphins .
On Tuesday , aquarium officials announced plans for a $ 110 million expansion , increasing itself by 1.5 million gallons , most of which will be used for dolphin windows , dolphin shows and something called “ dolphin encounters . ”
But the expansion of the popular tourist attraction , which has been open for about two and a half years , will also allow Atlanta to cement its claim to the “ world ’s largest aquarium ” moniker , a valuable bit of marketing braggadocio the Georgia Aquarium snatched from the John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago when it opened in November 2005 .
“ This is the next ‘ big wow , ’ ” Bernard Marcus , founder of The Home Depot and the philanthropist whose vision and deep pockets created the aquarium , said in a news release .

Everything the cartel does is geared into keeping both professional and private investors out of precious metals .
The so - called " wall of worry " which any given market is said to climb , is nothing more than a false , fraudulent front of disinformation which is created by elitist insiders on Wall Street , in our government and in corporate America , in order to scare people out of any market from which the elitists wish to profit .
They want you to keep out until they have bought in cheaply .
After they have glutted themselves , the wall of worry is removed and the public dupes are let in on " the coming huge rally " in whatever , all as promoted by our " beloved " fane - stream media .
The market is then run up by the sheople - dupes to a blow - off top , and then the inside players bail out with as much stealth as they can muster , booking monumental profits while the public sucker - dupes crash and burn and are essentially left holding the bag as they are advised by the fane - stream media to follow Charles Schwab 's mantra that " we 're in it for the long term . "
( Barf )
We have news for you - you 're in it for the long greased pole that the elitists will be shoving up your collective derrieres after they have glommed their pirate booty .
Yes indeed , you 're " in it for the long pole . "
The " wall of worry " for precious metals is no different and is a product of the cartel 's overall creative efforts at suppression of the monetary metals .
Gold suppression is JOB ONE at the Fed , and the Fed uses its vast powers , in conjunction with the powers given to the PPT by Reagan 's Executive Order ( and we might add in conjunction with powers that go way beyond the mandate called for in that Executive Order ) , to create the wall of worry for precious metals .
They do this not only because precious metals continually embarrass the value and integrity of their " worthless paper " which some prefer to call Federal Reserve notes ( printed by a Ponzi- scheming , privately owned Fed and backed by the full faith and credit of a bankrupt US Treasury ) , but also because they are attempting to alleviate what is one of their greatest causes for angst .
The fear we have just alluded to is the cartel 's fear that due to their complete bungling and ineptitude , gold and silver will explode before they can bail out of the general stock and bond markets through dark pools of liquidity that would hide their bailout from the public patsies .
They want to plow those proceeds into commodities and real , tangible assets , with gold and silver high on their list .
And when they buy , they want to get in cheap .
The problem is , that in their unmitigated greed and lust for power , as well as their paranoia about political fallout which they feel must be avoided at all costs ( costs which include the destruction of our economy ) , they have destroyed our nation 's real estate market , thereby destroying themselves in the process as all real estate - backed securities are in the process of being taken to the cleaners .
And that is just the tip of the iceberg as other debts such as credit cards and car loans start to implode along with our economy which in turn has been destroyed by free trade , globalization , off - shoring , outsourcing and illegal immigration .
Credit default swaps are now skyrocketing for many of the brokers and other financial institutions , indicating some very bad things to come , not the least of which are bank failures caused by the real estate debacle and the credit - crunch .
In order to save themselves , the Illuminists had to lower rates , thus destroying the dollar and sending gold to new all - time highs .
And in order to maintain oil backing for the dollar , they had to create more wars for profit to keep leaders from other countries from trading oil in currencies other than the dollar ; wars that have greatly supported gold as a safe - haven .
Meanwhile a $ 596 trillion time bomb of derivatives awaits the pressing of its detonator button through a combination of all the above .
Gold is going to go inter-dimensional when that ticking time bomb finally detonates .
Ah , the tangled webs we weave when we practice to deceive !
If you think it is safe to get back into the financial waters for stocks and bonds , we suggest you watch the original movie , " Jaws , " using the waters patrolled by the great white shark as your metaphor .
Already the stock markets have plummeted , and the bond markets are now under pressure as massive losses create higher rates of interest through accelerating risk reassessment .
The great white shark of hyperinflation waits under the deep , dark waters of financial profligacy , fiscal mismanagement , monetary imbecility , unfair trade with its attendant currency manipulations and rampant , rampaging fraud from top to bottom , with the bursting of the real estate bubble being a perfect example of this witches brew of economy - killing debacles .
Da-da , da - da ... da - da , da - da ... da - da , da - da ...
Gold and silver have now completed their rollover as of Friday and immediately the monetary metals began their recovery , bursting from 870 to 889 with a close at 888 , a number which Asians find propitious in their obsession with 8's .
We have to cut large specs some slack due to this rollover as they cannot all liquidate at the same time , so some downward pressure can be expected when you throw in massive cartel efforts to suppress and destroy the monetary metals .
They have a big rally planned , so you better stay tuned and take your position .
It does not matter what level you make your rollover at if you plan on pushing past 1000 again .
You make back all your losses and then some in that event , and we can assure you that the specs have no intention of passing up on a chance to make gargantuan profits and take back ground lost in the rollover .
Precious metals have the wind at their backs , while stocks , bonds and treasuries face a hurricane west wind .
If you want to really see gold and silver go on a rampage , liquidate all your precious metal paper counterfeits such as ETF 's , mint certificates and futures and use them to purchase and take possession of physical gold and silver bullion .
When the COMEX cupboards of gold and silver are empty , you have then purchased the casino and can gamble with impunity .
The bullion and collectable coins will skyrocket when volume takes them out of circulation .
That is what paper sources of gold and silver are all about , namely , to forestall the taking of precious metals off the table and out of circulation so these pools of paper gold and silver can be used against the very people who invested in them in the first place .
Be sure to take a goodly portion of your ETF liquidations and plow them into resource stocks .
ETF's are despicable , multipurpose elitist vehicles of metals suppression .
They create pools of gold and silver which can be sold and leased , and divert money away from more traditional vehicles like resource stocks .
Continuation of ETF investments is like spinning a revolver with five of six chambers loaded and then putting it to your head and pressing the trigger .
Why give the elitists a pool of gold , which is greater than many central banks possess so they can use it against you by leasing it out or selling it off .
Get in it for the long haul and stop taking profits and trading in and out .
Every time there is massive profit - taking , the cartel gets an undeserved breather , and of course they make any resulting downturn all the worse with their usual suppressive tactics .
Who would want futures , ETF's or mint certificates when the best leverage plays are in resource stocks .
A great junior will provide leverage that will outperform the futures market hands down without the risk of loss due to the passage of time .
You do not have to worry about running out of time when you own high quality resource stocks , but the time element is your main nemesis when you deal in futures .
We are puzzled and perplexed at the lack of interest in resource stocks , but can understand some of the reluctance because of the continual naked - shorting used by the cartel .
However , naked shorting is a two - edged sword , and if you catch the cartel off guard with a huge rally their shorts will get slaughtered and you will have a massive short - covering rally on your hands .
The yen was weakened this week to support general stock markets while gold and silver were under rollover pressure in the futures markets .
That is the only way stocks can go up , and now that the futures rollover is complete , any weakness in the yen will send carry traders into precious metals , as they are the only game in town right now .
Treasuries and bonds are under pressure due to inflation , the declining dollar and rising interest rates while stocks suffer the impact of an upcoming hyperinflationary recession and bad economic news across the board .
How anyone can have a positive attitude toward stocks with crude above 100 is beyond us .
The second quarter has been an absolute disaster and the earnings reports due out starting in July are going to be horrendous .
The stimulus has been completely negated by rising crude and food prices , not to mention the destruction of the real estate market , which has shut off the equity - extracting spigot .
The dollar rally has already petered out at 73 , and the dollar will now get systematically destroyed as everyone begins to flee stocks , bonds and treasuries in favor of real assets , which has already ongoing for many months now since the credit - crunch took control over market sentiment .
Specs should consider buying some dollar longs on the next big dollar dip , and acquire a healthy portion of oil shorts to guard against a takedown of oil to hit the precious metals .
These should be in addition to your usual arsenal of protective derivatives .
As you can see , the turndown in oil prices coincided precisely with the rollover period for the metals so the commercial shorts could bail out at lower price levels .
Open interest has greatly declined because the commercials were cashing out and not rolling all the proceeds over , choosing instead to pocket some cash because they know a rally is on its way .
Note that the short positions of Goldman Sachs are at unusually low levels as well .
Those expecting summer doldrums to step in are going to get their heads handed to them .
The market has completely changed , with investment demand far outstripping jewelry demand in importance .
The destruction of financial markets is under way and is starting to accelerate as inflation and recession take their toll .
Patterns are going to be broken this year and gold and silver are going to start marching to their own drummer .
We expect massive rallies before the end of the year .
So take your positions in physical metals and resource stocks and wait for the fun to begin .
Such investments are the surest bet you will find during the current economic headwinds .
Energy and food prices are soaring .
The housing market continues to collapse .
Government revenue is falling , and taxes are rising .
Airlines are jacking up fares and fees while reducing service .
Banks are pulling credit lines .
Auto companies are cutting production once again .
Even investment bankers are losing their jobs .
The tendency is to see these as separate developments , each with its own causes and dynamic .
Fundamentally , however , they are all part of the same story -- the story of the global economy purging itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time allowed many Americans to think they were richer than they really were .
Most of us understand that an overabundance of cheap , easy credit created a housing bubble that artificially inflated the price of land and housing , produced too many homes and homeowners , and persuaded too many Americans to dip into their home equity to support a lifestyle their income could not sustain , As we reported in detail earlier , SEC officials said in a statement that they had been monitoring Bear Stearns ’s financial situation on a daily basis in recent weeks , and had no cause for alarm earlier in the week .
Bear ’s holding company capital exceeded regulatory standards at the end of February , and information supplied by Bear Stearns to the SEC on Tuesday [ March 12 , 2008 ] showed the holding company had a “ substantial capital cushion , ” according to the SEC .
As of that date , the firm had more than $ 17 billion in cash and unencumbered liquid assets , the SEC said .
“ Beginning on that day , however , and increasingly throughout the week , lenders and customers of Bear Stearns began to remove funds from the firm , despite its stable capital position .
As a result , Bear Stearns ’s excess liquidity rapidly eroded , the statement says .
Please note in the following Moody ’s table that Bear Stearns ’ “ Total Illiquid Risk Assets ” at 31 % are far less than other ‘ bulge - bracket brokers . ’
Lehman is 197 % ; GS is 135 % , Morgan is 109 % , MER is 45 % ...
During the JP Morgan conference call on Bear , Bill Winters , Co-CEO of JP Morgan , said the following about Bear Stearns ’ condition : “ In fact what we 've -- we were very pleasantly surprised to see that it was a very well run , tight operation with good risk controls and a risk discipline that was very similar to our own . ”
If we were the SEC , we ’d be issuing subpoenas like crazy to ascertain if Bears ’ ‘ run ’ was a conspiracy .
We ’d check to see who shorted Bear stock , bought puts , CDS and other derivatives and cross check them against any party whose actions might have facilitated the run on Bear … Perhaps Bear Stearns stock rallied to 4.81 on the possibility of legal recourse .
Yesterday ’s WSJ : Bear Stearns Cos. plans to turn over documents to securities regulators showing that several financial giants , including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Citadel Investment Group and Paulson & Co. , slashed their exposure to the securities firm in the weeks before its collapse …
The SEC is expected to use the data to determine whether any trading activity was improperly coordinated in any way , constituted manipulation or otherwise contributed to Bear Stearns 's collapse .
George Bush ’s trip to the Middle East accomplished very little other than the fact he had to beg the Saudis for 300,000 more barrels of oil a day .
We have a very dangerous 7 months left with this crew and anything can happen .
Our biggest fear is he will start another war and there wo n’t be elections in November .
George Bush has been America ’s worst president in history .
He has prepared our country emotionally for the Federal Reserve ’s collapse of our currency , bringing an end to the dollar ’s reserve status .
In our current credit crisis it ’s save Wall Street and abandon the dollar .
The question is has a secret deal been made to give away all of our assets to satisfy our debts ?
George Bush has ruined our reputation with the assistance of Wall Street .
More than 70 % of foreigners despise our government and it ’s blatant corruption , and its senseless barbaric wars .
This is why on 5/16/08 the US did n’t attend the staple food summit in Lima , Peru .
Virtually everyone else of any note was there .
On the same day Brazil , Russia , India and China met in Russia to discuss forming a political alliance .
The US was n’t there either .
You are witnessing the end of America as an imperial power .
After Iraq and Afghanistan , with the exception of nuclear power , the US is a paper tiger .
They have exhausted their war resources and they are bankrupt .
The NATO summit was another loser for George and the neocons , as Russian President Putin put George in his place .
Europe is making major commercial inroads into commercial trade with South America .
It looks like the Monroe Doctrine is dead and so is a great deal of the influence the US once had in Latin America .
Worse yet , last week the foundations for a South American Union was laid and it wo n’t be long before an EU - Latin American free trade pact will become reality .
America is oblivious to what is going on .
They are too busy watching the circus in Iraq and Afghanistan .
After years of exploitation Latin America wants to dump the US and their arrogant demands , and their backing of every dictator in the hemisphere for the 150 years .
It is called gunboat exploitation .
America is in for a rude awakening .
What does a country do when they have a long - term commitment for $ 75 trillion or more ?
They cut spending and raise taxes .
Our country is doing just the opposite .
In the middle of a recession , production and consumption are falling and our leaders tell us there is little inflation and no recession .
Guidance like that will lead to national suicide .

The Taliban dug into defensive positions in a cluster of villages near Kandahar yesterday in apparent preparation for a battle on the doorstep of Afghanistan 's second city .
The brazen gambit came days after the Taliban smashed into Kandahar 's main prison , freeing 400 militants , and deepening the sense of crisis in the country .
Local elders said fighters had flooded into Arghandab , a rural sprawl of farmhouses and vineyards that stretches north - west of Kandahar city .
" They have blown up several bridges and are planting mines everywhere , " Muhammad Usman , a taxi driver who had evacuated a family , told reporters in Kandahar .
The Afghan army flew 700 soldiers into Kandahar and Nato redeployed Canadian soldiers in response to the Taliban actions .
But the US - led coalition - which operates under a separate chain of command - disputed the seriousness of the threat , saying it had deployed a patrol to Arghandab and found " no evidence that militants control the area " .
A Nato spokesman , Mark Laity , said the alliance had a " very mixed picture " about the size of the buildup .
" We assume insurgents are there but we have little evidence of hundreds .
You have some displaced people who are panicky , some bad guys who are exaggerating and so it's hard to know what is happening , " he said .
Laity said Nato aircraft had dropped leaflets on the area urging residents to stay indoors .
" We 're emphasising potential threats , " he said .
The Taliban have long prized Arghandab , whose pomegranate orchards and vineyards make for ideal guerrilla fighting ground .
Soviet troops never managed to capture the area during the 10 - year occupation that ended in 1989 .
But it has been vulnerable since the death last year of two leaders of the local Alokozai tribe , Mullah Naqibullah and Abdul Hakim Jan - one from a heart attack , the other in a suicide bombing .
Since then the Taliban have gradually infiltrated the area , but any attempt to establish complete control could exact a high price .
A similar move in Panjwayi , west of Kandahar , in late 2006 sparked a punishing Nato offensive that killed hundreds of fighters and forced many more to flee towards the Pakistani border .
Whatever its size , the latest manoeuvre shows that despite the presence of 65,000 foreign soldiers - the greatest number since 2001 - the Taliban can still produce surprises .
One commander , Mullah Ahmedullah , said escaped prisoners from Friday night 's jailbreak were among their ranks .
" We 've occupied most of the area and it's a good place for fighting .
Now we are waiting for the Nato and Afghan forces , " he told the Associated Press .
The jailbreak was a severe embarrassment for President Hamid Karzai and underlined his government 's failure to provide security .
Kandahar is under the control of his brother , Ahmed Wali , who heads the provincial council and wields much influence .
Karzai deflected criticism on to neighbouring Pakistan , warning on Sunday he would send troops to kill Taliban leaders sheltering in the tribal areas and North - West Frontier province .
Pakistan said it would not tolerate any incursion .
Listen closely to all those cheers for newly crowned nominee Barack Obama , and in the background you 'll catch the notes of a funeral march .
Resting , if not in peace , are the New Democrats .
The Illinois senator 's primary victory marked the end of many things , and one looks to be his party 's 20 - year experiment with ideological centrism .
The New Dems are still out there , still urging their party to fight its natural liberal instincts .
But who 's listening ?
Buoyed by the Republican implosion , wild for their retro nominee , the intellectual ...

Walker is urging women to turn the page on gender - based feminism .
KULA , Hawaii ( CNN ) --
Let 's all breathe a collective sigh of relief , shall we ?
Now that we 've got our nominee , Hillary can get some rest , Obama can read his daughters a bedtime story , and the rest of us can relax knowing our relative peace wo n't be shattered by another primary - related explosion .
Goodbye Reverend Wright and Bosnia tarmac snipers .
Goodbye bitter working - class voters and hard - working white people .
See you in November John King and the magic CNN map .
But what now ?
Obama has gracefully accepted the victory banner , and a lot of Hillary supporters , especially women , are walking off the field as if they 've lost a war .
I understand their frustration , but the truth is they did n't lose , not by a long shot .
Their candidate is stronger than ever , with 17 million votes under her belt , and the public discussion about the role of gender is more nuanced and compelling than it has been in decades .
The next woman candidate will have a better shot at the White House because of the tireless efforts of Hillary Rodham Clinton .
But with a Democratic house divided , now is the time for healing , and this can only happen if Hillary 's staunch female supporters let go of the reverse - sexist ideology that women are inherently better , wiser , and more compassionate leaders .
They will have to acknowledge that sometimes the best woman for the job is actually a man -- if it 's the right man .
Obama 's vote against the war , marriage to his female mentor , outstanding record on reproductive choice and a host of other progressive issues , and his uncanny ability to inspire people all over the world suggest he 's just that .
It is time to turn the page on myopic gender - based Feminism and concede that while patriarchy is real , so is female greed , dishonesty and corruptibility .
It 's time to empower the feminisms embodied by millions of women and men who care about everyone , including , but not limited to , women .
These are the feminists who wanted the first Clinton 's welfare reform to include real jobs for women , with real wages and real benefits .
They wanted trade agreements like NAFTA to empower female workers in other countries , not make them easier to exploit .
They also want to exhaust diplomatic means before threatening to bomb entire civilizations to dust in response to hostile challengers to U.S. supremacy .
These people -- male and female , young and old , black , white , yellow and brown , self - identified feminists and adamant rejecters of the term -- move from a place of passion , hope , and yes , pragmatism .
They realize Obama will need to assemble a stellar team to move his vision forward .
And they plan to hold him accountable for his positions on all of it : racism , sexism , socio- economic disparities , the environment , education , health care , a living wage and any other obstacles to the ideals of equality upon which this great nation was founded .
Clinton supporters are n't the only ones with work to do .
I spoke at Harvard a few years ago on the necessity of ending divisiveness and relying more on the human capacity for openness as a baseline for true progress .
This position is necessary not only in feminist circles , but in the primal fight or flight mechanism of our own minds .
As angry as some Obama supporters might be , as disheartened as we may feel , the only way out is to believe in the power of human beings to rise to the moral imperative .
Judging by the state of the world , we may not get another chance .

All About Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton
A man from Milton Keynes is set to win £ 5,000 after literally betting on his own life .
Doctors diagnosed Jon Matthews with a rare form of lung cancer in April 2007 and gave him nine months to live .
But Mr Matthews , 58 , made a £ 100 bet at 50 to one with William Hill bookmakers that he would beat the survival time for this condition .
On Sunday he is expected to pick up his £ 5,000 winnings , said a spokesman for William Hill .
' I 'm holding on '
Mr Matthews , a former car dealer , told BBC News on Friday that he feels fine and plans to give half of his winnings to charity .
Mr Matthews said when he was first diagnosed he thought " well hang on a minute , I 'm holding on " .
" So I took the bet with the bookies and they gave me odds of fifty to one , " he said .
" They would n't let me spend more than a £ 100 , so £ 5,000 I 'm due to collect on Sunday . "
Graham Sharpe , media relations director with William Hill , said : " I am delighted I was able to lay him the bet and at least give him an incentive to be positive for a year . "
Mr Sharpe said he had never come across a bet like this before .
With Euro 2008 all over and the winners Spain still celebrating their great success and the losers Germany still licking their wounds , I thought I would take a hopefully ‘ light hearted ’ look at who might be awarded the Soccerlens ‘ alternative awards ’ for the tournament .
There are many categories we could look at but I do n’t think we should bother with what went well , everyone gets enough praise and financial reward for that .
Let ’s hand out some awards to those who were less fortunate and will be grateful to win anything .
Worst goalkeeping error
Petr Cech is undoubtedly a great keeper , but his error in the decisive group game against Turkey must win this award .
Not only did he make a complete hash of a simple catch from a poor cross , he managed to drop the ball at the feet of Nihat , the only Turkish player in the penalty area .
On top of that , the mistake actually cost his side a place in the quarter - finals .
More importantly than all of that however , is the fact that I had the Czech Republic to win in a sweepstake and he cost me a fiver .
No contest .
Cech it is !
Worst piece of defending
Eric Abidal was obviously regarded by French manager Domenech ( a man who believes he should pick his side according to the player ’s birth signs ! ) as a better bet for the left back slot than Patrice Evra or Gael Clichy .
Thankfully , after one very poor performance against Romania the manager came to his senses , presumably realising that Abidal was a Taurus and Uranus was rising , or something similar , and left him out .
Then , just when we thought Abidal ’s agony was over , in the deciding game against Italy , not only did Abidal get back into the side but he found himself playing at centre half .
His early contributions to the game were understandably nervy and showed a distinct lack of confidence .
Then , twenty odd minutes into the game he allowed Luca Toni to get away from him after being caught on the wrong side .
Now , we all know that the likelihood of Toni actually scoring was very small indeed , judging by the other chances he missed in the tournament , but Abidal felt the need to bring him down in the box , get sent off and give Italy a goal that was likely to be decisive .
The phrase , ‘ oh dear ’ does n’t really do the incident justice !
Worst miss
Mario Gomez came into the tournament with a fantastic reputation .
It was largely undone in his totally anonymous performances against Poland and Croatia , but then came a defining moment in the third game against Austria .
It is amazing that in amongst the absolute catalogue of previously mentioned misses produced by Luca Toni for Italy we can’t find one to rival the one of Gomez , but the awful moment in the Austria game means that Gomez is unchallenged .
Not only did he miss a simple tap in to an empty goal from six yards by scooping the ball straight up into the air , he then made a really weak effort to head it in as it came down .
In fact , he did n’t get off the ground and allowed a smaller defender to barge him out of the way and head the ball to safety .
It was truly abysmal .
Worst player
Malouda was average at best all season at Chelsea .
Most French fans would have been delighted if Malouda could have reached the rarified heights of average in this tournament .
It is difficult to put into words just how poor the winger was in his two appearances .
I really thought that he would show everyone what he could produce in this tournament and explain why Chelsea wanted him in the first place .
He did n’t .
I ’m still a bit confused .
Worst team
France , Greece , Poland , Austria and Switzerland all staked a claim for this award .
Austria and Switzerland were both expected to get knocked out without winning a game .
Switzerland actually did pick up a victory and Austria got a point more than they should have done .
For those reasons and the fact that they hosted such a good tournament , I am ruling them out of the running .
Poland would have lost heavily in all of their games if they had n’t had the excellent Artur Boruc in goal .
However , he is part of the team , so they ca n’t be the worst .
Greece never looked like getting anything but nobody really expected them to .
They probably performed up ( or down ) to expectations .
That leaves France .
Not only were they very disappointing for a team that was one of the favourites , they actually were pretty awful as well .
I think they are worthy recipients of the worst team award .
Italy ran them close with their performance in the quarter - final but it has to go to the French .
Most boring game
Romania v
France in the first round of games was one of the worst games I have ever had the misfortune to watch .
I ca n’t say it was actually the worst for two reasons .
Firstly , I ’ve watched Watford and England all my life and secondly , I fell asleep and missed the last fifteen minutes .
Worst manager
Raymond Domenech handled his French side with all the skill and ability of a poorly performing Steve McClaren .
Not only did he make strange team selections and substitutions , he also came out prior to the tournament and announced his belief in picking his side according to the powers of Astrology .
If you wrote the story of Domenech as fiction you would be laughed at for writing such an unbelievable tale .
and finally :
Lifetime achievement award for not being very good
Maybe controversially I am going to give this award to the French super striker Nicolas Anelka .
He has won many trophies in his career but few friends and few individual awards .
His record of eleven goals in fifty - one internationals is pretty poor and his club record of ninety league goals in his last two and seventy three games for seven different clubs since he left Arsenal back in 1999 , is not the record of a world class marksman .
Some people rate Anelka really highly and I value the opinion of some of those people .
However , I just ca n’t see it , so as he has won so few individual awards I thought I should give this one to him .
Summary :
Worst Goalkeeper : Petr Cech ( Czech Republic , Chelsea )
Worst Defender : Eric Abidal ( France , Barcelona )
Worst Miss : Mario Gomez ( Germany , Stuttgart )
Worst Player : Florent Malouda ( France , Chelsea )
Worst Team : France
Most Boring Game : Romania v France
Worst Manager : Raymond Domenech
Lifetime achievement for not being very good : Nicolas Anelka

June 26 , 2008  --
A Congressional panel voted Wednesday against giving the FBI $ 11 million it requested to expand a controversial data - mining program , citing concerns about Americans ' privacy and the lack of answers from the bureau on how the program operates .
The National Security Analysis Center ( NSAC ) brings together hundreds of millions of electronic records created or collected by the FBI and other government agencies , according to FBI documents .
The bureau has said it expects that number to skyrocket in the coming years .
Its annual budget , which the FBI had hoped to increase , is roughly $ 60 million .
Last year , lawmakers raised questions about the FBI 's stated goal of using the vast ocean of data to " predict " who might be a potential terrorist , in the absence of intelligence linking the man or woman to any radical or extremist group .
Leading experts , and even U.S. intelligence officials , have said the approach is not feasible .
In an earlier report to Congress , the FBI called NSAC " a dynamic organization with an evolving mission " and " the next essential step " in fulfilling President Bush 's order to create a National Security Service within the Justice Department and FBI .
The Bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story .
" It is unclear how the Bureau intends to define these predictive models in such a way as to avoid needless intrusions into the privacy of innocent citizens , " a House appropriations panel wrote in a report explaining its decision to withhold $ 11 million in money the FBI had requested to expand the program .
The report also cites concerns about the program wasting agents ' time by sending them out to run down false leads .
Concerns the administration was withholding information from Congress about the program were also raised by Rep. Brad Miller , D - N.C. , one of two lawmakers to initially raise concerns about the NSAC .
In a letter to the House Appropriations Chairman David R. Obey , D - Wisc. obtained by ABC News , Miller complained that the Bush administration had stonewalled efforts by investigators from Congress ' Government Accountability Office to arrange meetings and obtain information about the program .
Congress last year asked the GAO to investigate the program .
" It took repeated attempts by GAO even to obtain an initial meeting with Justice Department officials on the issue , " Miller wrote .
" At their initial meeting , Justice Department officials bluntly told GAO that they would provide no information and GAO had no right to see any records " regarding the role and purpose of the center , and what kinds of information it would hold , arguing that as a " national security system " it was " exempt " from Congressional oversight .
It was his understanding , Miller wrote , that Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell had instructed the department to withhold the information .
A spokesman for McConnell who declined to be named confirmed his office had spoken with the Department of Justice on sharing information with GAO .
According to the spokesman , McConnell 's office believed the law said some intelligence matters could only be reviewed by the House and Senate intelligence committees , and not GAO .
" Nevertheless , we have often made available information to GAO , " he said .
While the House has voted to withhold the money , a Senate effort could get the funding reinstated , although observers say that is unlikely .

I have been running Linux both on my desktop and on my laptop for a couple of years already , and it just works .
Recently I decided to sell my laptop to get on a better one , though , so I figured I would need to load a fresh Windows install on it ( after all the probability of finding another Linux user to buy it is pretty low ) .
So I just loaded the OEM Windows copy , installed it , and once I was done BAM !
All those bad memories came back suddenly .
How much preinstalled crap do they manage to put on those things ?
I know that this is not Microsoft ’s fault .
PC manufacturers are bloating the installs to make some money from the software vendors .
I find this annoying nonetheless .
And if you think there is not enough crap on that install , just consider that it came both with Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security 🙂 .

Dangers of a Salaried Bureaucracy Benjamin Franklin ( 170690 ) ( 1787 ) Born in Boston in 1706 , died in 1790 ; settled in Philadelphia in 1729 ; Postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737 ; discovered the identity of lightning with electricity in 1753 ; proposed a  Plan of Union at Albany in 1754 ; Colonial Agent for Pennsylvania in England , 175762 and 176475 ; Member of the Second Continental Congress in 1775 ; Member of the Committee which drew up the Declaration of Independence in 1776 ; Ambassador to France in 1776 ; helped to negotiate the treaty of peace with France in 1778 ; helped to negotiate the treaty of peace with England in 1783 ; President of Pennsylvania 1785  88 ; Member of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 .
I T 1 is with reluctance that I rise to express a disapprobation of any one article of the plan for which we are so much obliged to the honorable gentlemen who laid it before us .
From its first reading I have borne a good will to it , and , in general , wished it success .
In this particular of salaries to the executive branch , I happen to differ ; and , as my opinion may appear new and chimerical , it is only from a persuasion that it is right , and from a sense of duty , that I hazard it .
The committee will judge of my reasons when they have heard them , and their judgment may possibly change mine .
I think I see inconveniences in the appointment of salaries ; I see none in refusing them , but , on the contrary , great advantages .

Sir , there are two passions which have a powerful influence in the affairs of men .
These are ambition and avarice the love of power and the love of money .
Separately , each of these has great force in prompting men to action ; but , when united in view of the same object , they have , in many minds , the most violent effects .
Place before the eyes of such men a post of honor , that shall , at the same time , be a place of profit , and they will move heaven and earth to obtain it .
The vast number of such places it is that renders the British government so tempestuous .
The struggles for them are the true source of all those factions which are perpetually dividing the nation , distracting its councils , hurrying it sometimes into fruitless and mischievous wars , and often compelling a submission to dishonorable terms of peace .
2
And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable preeminence , through all the bustle of cabal , the heat of contention , the infinite mutual abuse of parties , tearing to pieces the best of characters ?
It will not be the wise and moderate , the lovers of peace and good order , the men fittest for the trust .
It will be the bold and the violent , the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in their selfish pursuits .
These will thrust themselves into your government and be your rulers .
And these , too , will be mistaken in the expected happiness of their situation , for their vanquished competitors , of the same spirit , and from the same motives , will perpetually be endeavoring to distress their administration , thwart their measures , and render them odious to the people .

Besides these evils , sir , tho we may set out in the beginning with moderate salaries , we shall find that such will not be of long continuance .
Reasons will never be wanting for proposed augmentations ; and there will always be a party for giving more to the rulers , that the rulers may be able , in return , to give more to them .
Hence , as all history informs us , there has been in every state and kingdom a constant kind of warfare between the governing and the governed ; the one striving to obtain more for its support , and the other to pay less .
And this has alone occasioned great convulsions , actual civil wars , ending either in dethroning of the princes or enslaving of the people .
4
Generally , indeed , the ruling power carries its point , and we see the revenues of princes constantly increasing , and we see that they are never satisfied , but always in want of more .
The more the people are discontented with the oppression of taxes , the greater need the prince has of money to distribute among his partizans , and pay the troops that are to suppress all resistance , and enable him to plunder at pleasure .
There is scarce a king in a hundred who would not , if he could , follow the example of Pharaoh get first all the peoples money , then all their lands , and then make them and their children servants for ever .
It will be said that we do not propose to establish kings .
I know it .
But there is a natural inclination in mankind to kingly government .
It sometimes relieves them from aristocratic domination .
They would rather have one tyrant than five hundred .
It gives more of the appearance of equality among citizens ; and that they like .
5 I am apprehensive , therefore perhaps too apprehensive that the government of the States may , in future times , end in a monarchy .
But this catastrophe , I think , may be long delayed , if in our proposed system we do not sow the seeds of contention , faction , and tumult , by making our posts of honor places of profit .
If we do , I fear that , tho we employ at first a number and not a single person , the number will , in time , be set aside ; it will only nourish the fetus of a king ( as the honorable gentleman from Virginia very aptly expressed it ) , and a king will the sooner be set over us .
6
It may be imagined by some that this is a Utopian idea , and that we can never find men to serve us in the executive department without paying them well for their services .
I conceive this to be a mistake .
Some existing facts present themselves to me which incline me to a contrary opinion .
The high sheriff of a county in England is an honorable office , but it is not a profitable one .
It is rather expensive , and therefore not sought for .
But yet it is executed , and well executed , and usually by some of the principal gentlemen of the county .
In France the office of counselor , or member of their judiciary parliament , is more honorable .
It is therefore purchased at a high price ; there are , indeed , fees on the law proceedings , which are divided among them , but these fees do not amount to more than three per cent .
on the sum paid for the place .
Therefore , as legal interest is there at five per cent . , they , in fact , pay two per cent .
for being allowed to do the judiciary business of the nation , which is , at the same time , entirely exempt from the burden of paying them any salaries for their services .
7 I do not , however , mean to recommend this as an eligible mode for our judiciary department .
I only bring the instance to show that the pleasure of doing good and serving their country , and the respect such conduct entitles them to , are sufficient motives with some minds to give up a great portion of their time to the public , without the mean inducement of pecuniary satisfaction .
8
Another instance is that of a respectable society who have made the experiment and practised it with success now more than a hundred years .
I mean the Quakers .
It is an established rule with them that they are not to go to law , but in their controversies they must apply to their monthly , quarterly , and yearly meetings .
Committees of these sit with patience to hear the parties , and spend much time in composing their differences .
In doing this they are supported by a sense of duty and the respect paid to usefulness .
It is honorable to be so employed , but it was never made profitable by salaries , fees , or perquisites .
And , indeed , in all cases of public service , the less the profit , the greater the honor .
9
To bring the matter nearer home , have we not seen the greatest and most important of our offices , that of general of our armies , executed for eight years together , without the smallest salary , by a patriot whom I will not now offend by any other praise ; and this , through fatigues and distresses , in common with the other brave men , his military friends and companions , and the constant anxieties peculiar to his station ?
And shall we doubt finding three or four men in all the United States with public spirit enough to bear sitting in peaceful council , for , perhaps , an equal term , merely to preside over our civil concerns , and see that our laws are duly executed ?
Sir , I have a better opinion of our country .
I think we shall never be without a sufficient number of wise and good men to undertake and execute well and faithfully the office in question .
10 Sir , the saving of the salaries , that may at first be proposed , is not an object with me .
The subsequent mischiefs of proposing them are what I apprehend .
And , therefore , it is that I move the amendment .
If it be not seconded or accepted , I must be contented with the satisfaction of having delivered my opinion frankly and done my duty .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Psychiatrist and broadcaster Dr Raj Persaud was suspended for three months after being found unfit to practice for plagiarising other people ’s work , the medical watchdog said on Friday .

The celebrity psychiatrist was suspended after his conduct was found to be “ inappropriate , misleading , dishonest and liable to bring the profession into disrepute ” , the General Medical Council said .
Persaud , the former presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme “ All in the Mind ” , said in a statement he was “ saddened ” by the GMC panel ’s findings and decision .
During the disciplinary hearing in Manchester this week he had admitted copying pieces from four research papers for his 2003 book “ From the Edge of the Couch ” .
He had also admitted copying passages from two other academic pieces of work in a series of newspaper articles and journals .
Persaud , who was also resident psychiatrist on the daytime TV show “ This Morning ” and had written for the Daily Telegraph and the Independent newspapers , had denied dishonesty .
He had said he was in a confused mental state at the time of writing the work because of the pressure of juggling his work for the media and the National Health Service .
The panel acknowledged in its findings that Persaud had shown regret and taken remedial action , making it highly unlikely he would ever repeat his actions .
He had cut down on his media and journalistic projects and was more cautious about taking on extra work , it added .
“ It has had regard to the fact that there has been no patient harm , that your plagiarism was not financially motivated , that it did not relate to research fraud and that there are measures in place to avoid repetition , ” the panel said .
“ The panel has determined that a three month period of suspension is sufficient to send out a signal to you , the profession and the public that plagiarism is unacceptable behaviour . ”
Persaud said in a statement : “ I accept that my use of the work of some authors lacked adequate acknowledgement .
I have apologised repeatedly for this during the hearing , and I apologise for this now .
“ I am saddened that this occurred while I was seeking to promote the work of academics to the wider public . ”
Persaud is a consultant psychiatrist at the Bethlem Royal and Maudsley Hospitals and Gresham professor for Public Understanding of Psychiatry .
In 2002 , he was voted one of the top 10 psychiatrists in the UK by a survey of the Institute of Psychiatry and the Royal College of Psychiatrists .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A deep green fungus best known for eating through uniforms and canvas tents during World War Two might provide a more efficient way to make biofuels such as ethanol , researchers reported on Monday .
They sequenced the complete genome of Trichoderma reesei and found important clues about how it breaks down plant fibers into the simple sugars needed to make plant - based fuel .
While its appetite for cotton and other fibrous plants caused trouble for troops in the South Pacific , the fungus might provide a way to use switchgrass and other nonfood plants to make biofuels , the researchers reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology .
One barrier to using nonfood plants to make biofuels has been the difficulty in converting them into sugar .
Food crops such as corn more readily convert .
“ Our analysis , coupled with the genome sequence data , provides a road map for constructing enhanced T. reesei strains for industrial applications such as biofuel production , ” Diego Martinez of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and colleagues wrote .
The fungus has already been exploited commercially .
“ It has enjoyed a long history of safe use for industrial enzyme production , ” they wrote .
But the genetic analysis overturned some assumptions about how it worked .
It uses enzymes it creates to break down plant fibers into the simplest form of sugar , known as a monosaccharide .
But it has fewer genes dedicated to the production of cellulose - eating enzymes than other fungi do .
“ We were aware of T. reesei ’s reputation as producer of massive quantities of degrading enzymes .
However we were surprised by how few enzyme types it produces , which suggested to us that its protein secretion system is exceptionally efficient , ” Martinez , who is also at the University of New Mexico , said in a statement .
T. reesei could be grown on an industrial scale to secrete its fiber - eating enzymes , which in turn could be added to pulped - up plants to produce sugar .
The sugar can then be fermented by yeast to produce ethanol .
“ The information contained in its genome will allow us to better understand how this organism degrades cellulose so efficiently and to understand how it produces the required enzymes so prodigiously , ” said Joel Cherry of Danish - based Novozymes , a biotechnology company that took part in the study .
“ Using this information , it may be possible to improve both of these properties , decreasing the cost of converting cellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals , ” Cherry said .
Japanese Cannibal ‘ Tsutomu Miyazaki ’ Put to Death
In April 2008 , we did an article about Issei Sagawa , a famous Japanese cannibal who killed and ate his girlfriend during college .
It would appear he was not the only famous Japanese cannibal as it was announced that Tsutomu Miyazaki , a notorious serial killer who killed four little girls and ate parts of thier bodies , was put to death .
Miyazaki had an obseission with sexual cartoons and pornography , which got him the nickname the “ cannibal nerd ” .
Miyazaki was arrested in July of 1989 while trying to take pictures of naked girls outside .
He then confessed to the killing of the four kids , aged between four and seven , and then eating their bodies , sleeping next toÂ their corpses , and drinking their blood .
Police found about 6,000 videotapes filled with horrific footage at his home in Saitama , near Tokyo , Japan .
Miyazaki ’s lawyers fought that he was insane and not responsible for his actions , but he was convicted in February of 2006 and put to death after about 20 years of judicial hearings recently on June 17 , 2008 .
“ The atrocious murder of four girls to satisfy his sexual desire leaves no room for leniency , ” said the Chief Justice .
Miyazakishowed any remorse for his actions and it was revealed through his psychologist that Miyazaki thought by murdering the children he could bring his grandmother back .
She had died a few months before Miyazaki commited the first murder in 1988 .
“ Please tell the world that I ’m a gentle man ” was the last thing he said to his psychologist .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
I just saw a D&D fourth edition commercial on TV .
Seriously .
It consisted of several different scenes with a huge , life - size model of a beholder in the middle of it , a D&D Insider logo at the end , and a voice - over .
It was stupid .
Really stupid .
As the SigO put it , “ What demographic are they going for ? ”
The answer : None I ’ve ever seen .
I ’m less than impressed .
Just before posting this , I found it on YouTube :
I can see what they were going for .
It was an attempt at using absurdity to create a low - key humorous attention - grabber .
What we ended up with , though , was a somnolent piece of uninspired blah that is n’t likely to excite anyone except those who are just excited to see any D&D commercial on TV at all .
It ’s just . . . bad .
edit : I found Quicktime videos for both the ad and the “ making of ” at the Wizards of the Coast website , in case you care .
Mr. Martinez ’s success at building a rapport with the most ruthless of terrorists goes to the heart of the interrogation debate .
Did it suggest that traditional methods alone might have obtained the same information or more ?
Or did Mr. Mohammed talk so expansively because he feared more of the brutal treatment he had already endured ?

A definitive answer is unlikely under the Bush administration , which has insisted in court that not a single page of 7,000 documents on the program can be made public .
The C.I.A. declined to provide information for this article , in part , a spokesman said , because the agency did not want to interfere with the military trials planned for Mr. Mohammed and four other Qaeda suspects at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The two dozen current and former American and foreign intelligence officials interviewed for this article offered a tantalizing but incomplete description of the C.I.A. detention program .
Most would speak of the highly classified program only on the condition of anonymity .
Mr. Martinez declined to be interviewed ; his role was described by colleagues .
Gen. Michael V. Hayden , director of the C.I.A. , and a lawyer representing Mr. Martinez asked that he not be named in this article , saying that the former interrogator believed that the use of his name would invade his privacy and might jeopardize his safety .
The New York Times , noting that Mr. Martinez had never worked undercover and that others involved in the campaign against Al Qaeda have been named in news articles and books , declined the request .
( An editors ’ note on this issue has been posted on The Times ’s Web site . )
The very fact that Mr. Martinez , a career narcotics analyst who did not speak the terrorists ’ native languages and had no interrogation experience , would end up as a crucial player captures the ad - hoc nature of the program .
Officials acknowledge that it was cobbled together under enormous pressure in 2002 by an agency nearly devoid of expertise in detention and interrogation .
“ I asked , ‘ What are we going to do with these guys when we get them ? ’ ” recalled A. B. Krongard , the No. 3 official at the C.I.A. from March 2001 until 2004 .
“ I said , ‘ We ’ve never run a prison .
We do n’t have the languages .
We do n’t have the interrogators . ’ ”
In its scramble , the agency made the momentous decision to use harsh methods the United States had long condemned .
With little research or reflection , it borrowed its techniques from an American military training program modeled on the torture repertories of the Soviet Union and other cold - war adversaries , a lineage that would come to haunt the agency .
Dave Hackenberg 's bees have been on the road for four days .
To reach the almond orchards of California 's Central Valley , they pass through the fertile plains of the Mississippi , huge cattle ranches and oilfields in Texas , and the dusty towns of New Mexico on their 2,600 - mile journey from Florida .
The bees will have seen little of the dramatic landscape , being cooped up in hives stacked four high on the back of trucks .
Each truck carries close to 500 hives , tethered with strong harnesses and covered with black netting to prevent the millions of passengers from escaping .
When the drivers pull over to sleep , the bees have a break from the constant movement and wind speed , but there 's no opportunity to look around and stretch their wings .
Their final destination is some two hours north of Los Angeles .
As the sun begins to fade over the vast , flat terrain , the convoy slowly snakes through orchards filled with row upon row of almond trees stretching as far as the eye can see .
Every February , the valley plays host to billions of honeybees as trees burst into blossom , blanketing the landscape in a soft , pinkish hue which extends to the horizon .
The sandy loam and Mediterranean climate are perfect for the cultivation of almonds , but that 's where any comparisons to picturesque orchards of Spain or Italy end .
Here , there are no verdant weeds , wild flowers or grass verges to please the eye , just never - ending trees that form what looks like an outdoor production line .
In the cool hours after sunset and before sunrise , more than one million hives are unloaded at regular intervals between the trees by commercial beekeepers such as Dave Hackenberg , who have travelled from the far corners of the US to take part in the world 's largest managed pollination event .
The mammoth orchards of Central Valley stretch the distance from London to Aberdeen , and the 60 million almond trees planted with monotonous uniformity along the 400 - mile route require half of all the honeybees in the US to pollinate them - a staggering 40 billion .
By February 16 , National Almond Day in the US , the trees are usually covered in flowers and humming with the sound of busy bees .
Attracted by the sweet nectar that each flower offers , the bees crawl around on the petals to find the perfect sucking position .
As they do so , their furry bodies are dusted with beads of pollen .
As they fly from blossom to blossom in search of more of the sweet energy drink , they transfer pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part , and so fertilise it .
Not long afterwards , the plant 's ovaries swell into fruit , which by late August turn into precious , oval - shaped nuts .
Without this army of migrant pollinators paying a visit for three weeks every year , the trees would fail to bear the almonds that are California 's most valuable horticultural export .
Last year , they earned the state more than $ 1.9bn , double the revenue from its Napa Valley vineyards .
Moreover , 80 % of the world 's almonds now come from this pocket of the planet .
But the supply of almonds in confectionery , cakes and packets of nuts is now threatened by a mysterious malady that is causing honeybees to disappear .
Hackenberg was the first beekeeper to report that his bees had vanished .
On a November day 18 months ago , he checked the hives in his Florida bee yard to find they were empty .
" They were n't dead , they were just gone , " he recalls .
Since then , close on two million colonies of honeybees across the US have been wiped out .
The strange phenomenon , dubbed colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) , is also thought to have claimed the lives of billions of honeybees around the world .
In Taiwan , 10 million honeybees were reported to have disappeared in just two weeks , and throughout Europe honeybees are in peril .
In Britain , John Chapple was the first to raise the alarm .
In January 2007 , he lost all of the 14 colonies in his garden in west London .
" It 's too cold at that time of year to open the hives , " he says , " so I always check on the bees by giving the hive a thump and waiting for what sounds like a roaring sound to come back .
But there was nothing , just silence . "
When he opened the hives to see what had happened , he found them practically empty .
Examination of a further 26 hives scattered across the capital revealed that two - thirds had perished .
" I was completely shocked , " says Chapple , who chairs the London Beekeepers ' Association .
" I could attribute some losses to a failing queen bee or wax moths , but there were a few I could find no reason for .
There was a healthy queen and a few bees , but nothing else . "
Chapple 's inquiries as to whether the parks where he kept some of his hives had sprayed new pesticides also drew a blank .
He was not alone .
Beekeepers in north - west London also reported strange losses .
Chapple calls the disappearance the " Mary Celeste syndrome " .
A year later , a survey of hives by government bee inspectors across Britain has found that one in five colonies has perished this winter .
There are some 270,000 honeybee hives in Britain run by 44,000 keepers , more than 90 % of them amateurs .
According to estimates by the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) , bees contribute £ 165 m a year to the economy through their pollination of fruit trees , field beans and other crops .
In addition , the 5,000 tonnes of British honey sold in UK stores generates a further £ 12 m .
UK farming minister Lord Rooker , however , warned last year that honeybees are in acute danger : " If nothing is done about it , the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years , " he said .
Last month , he launched a consultation on a national strategy to improve and protect honeybee health .
People 's initial response to the idea of a bee - less world is often either , " That 's a shame , I 'll have no honey to spread on my toast " or , " Good - one less insect that can sting me . "
In fact , honeybees are vital for the pollination of around 90 crops worldwide .
In addition to almonds , most fruits , vegetables , nuts and seeds are dependent on honeybees .
Crops that are used as cattle and pig feed also rely on honeybee pollination , as does the cotton plant .
So if all the honeybees disappeared , we would have to switch our diet to cereals and grain , and give our wardrobes a drastic makeover .
According to Albert Einstein , our very existence is inextricably linked to bees - he is reputed to have said : " If the bee disappears off the surface of the globe , then man would only have four years of life left . "
Bees are a barometer of what man is doing to the environment , say beekeepers ; the canary in the coalmine .
Just as animals behave weirdly before an earthquake or a hurricane , cowering in a corner or howling in the wind , so the silent , empty hives are a harbinger of a looming ecological crisis .
But what is causing them to vanish - pesticides , parasites , pests , viruses ?
No one knows for sure .
The more fanciful theories when CCD was first detected included an al - Qaida plot to wreck US agriculture , radiation from mobile phones and even celestial intervention in the form of honeybee rapture .
Scientists around the world are trying to pinpoint the culprit , but it is proving elusive .
They have even set up an international network to monitor honeybee losses - a sort of Interpol for bees - which is operating out of Switzerland .
Its coordinator , bee pathologist Dr Peter Neumann , blames a bloodsucking mite called varroa .
Little bigger than a pinhead , it has preyed on honeybees in Europe and the US since its arrival 30 years ago .
Under a microscope , the reddish - brown mite looks like a cross between a jellyfish and a Frisbee .
It activates lethal viruses in honeybees and carries them from bee to bee when it feeds on their blood , like a dirty syringe spreading HIV / Aids .
" It has to be the backbone of the problem , " Neumann says .
" But it is probably not acting alone . "
In the US , where the genetic code of the honeybee was unravelled by scientists two years ago , they have been employing advanced technology to discover if a new virus is responsible for killing the bees .
Genome sequencing techniques uncovered the DNA of a virus called Israeli acute paralysis virus ( IAPV ) that was found in almost all of the hives suffering from CCD .
The discovery , published in Science , was hailed as a major breakthrough in the investigation .
But honeybees are riddled with latent viruses .
They become a problem and cause disease only when the bee 's immune system is shot .
Like humans , they are prone to illness when they are stressed and run-down .
So the real question is , what is making the bees too weak to fight a virus ?
The answer is probably overwork , coupled with various environmental factors that are the flipside of pollination on an industrial scale and intensified food production .
After Hackenberg 's bees have pollinated the almonds in California , they head north to the apple orchards of Washington State , then east for the cranberries and pumpkins , before reaching Maine in May to pollinate blueberries .
In a year , they can cover 11,000 miles .
It 's a well - worn route that 's travelled by many of the 1,000 commercial beekeepers in America who between them own 90 % of the country 's 2.4 million honeybee colonies .
It is pollination , rather than honey production , that keeps US beekeepers in business .
In 2007 , honey production was worth $ 160 m to the US economy , compared with pollination services that have been estimated at $ 15bn .
Joe Traynor is a California bee broker .
From a small office in a quiet side street in downtown Bakersfield , on the southern tip of Central Valley , he runs a lucrative business matching almond growers with beekeepers .
I put to him that surely all this moving around of bees , confined to their hives for long periods , must be stressful for them .
He admits that too much travel is not good for their health : " When you 're trucking bees , they need sleep , just as humans do , and the bumping around in the truck for two to three days keeps them awake , and this lowers their resistance to pests and disease . "
Hackenberg , however , disagrees : " I 've been doing this 40 - odd years .
We 've done all the same things , but the rules have changed .
Something 's messing up . "
Hackenberg , 59 , wears cowboy boots , a checked shirt and blue jeans .
He even has a hard hat in the shape of a Stetson , with netting attached that he wears when unloading beehives .
He began his own investigations into what killed 2,000 of his honeybees at the end of 2006 , by talking to growers and reading up on pesticide use and research into their effects on bees .
" It 's those new neonicotinoid pesticides that growers are using , " he says .
" That 's what 's messing up the bees ' navigation system so they can't find their way home . "
Honeybees have a sophisticated dance language they use to communicate with each other in the hive .
Until Karl von Frisch unlocked the mysteries of this dance - his discovery won him a Nobel prize in 1973 - we did n't fully appreciate that bees returning to the hive laden with nectar and pollen will tell their sisters ( all worker bees are female ) where they got their supplies by doing a dance that points to the location of the flowers in relation to the sun 's position .
Tests have shown that the pesticides Hackenberg refers to can interfere with the bees ' communication and orientation skills , and also impair memory .
With innocuous brand names such as Gaucho , Assail and Merit , these pesticides are used worldwide , from sunflower fields to apple orchards , lawns to golf courses .
The chemicals they contain are an artificial type of nicotine that acts as a neurotoxin that attacks insects ' nervous systems on contact or ingestion .
Because it is systemic , the chemical moves throughout a plant , so if it is applied as a seed dressing , it will travel to the shoots , stem , leaves and flowers where bees can come into contact with small doses .
Many of these widely used pesticides are classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as " highly toxic to bees " and come with a warning label intended to help prevent their exposure to the pollinators .
" It 's in such small print that the growers do n't see it , " Hackenberg says .
He accuses farmers of " stacking " - or mixing - pesticides , herbicides and fungicides .
" No one has ever tested what happens to the toxicity if they do mix , simply because the chemical companies are not required to by law , but this combination could be a thousand times more lethal than if the chemicals are applied separately . "
In Britain , beekeeping is very small - scale compared with the US .
There are a few hundred professional beekeepers , who run an average of 100 hives each ; only around 50 of them transport bees to orchards , usually over distances of 25 or so miles , rather than across a continent .
Many orchards provide a year - round home for hives kept by amateur beekeepers , so there is no need for migratory beekeepers .
But in this country , as in the rest of Europe , it is hard to escape pesticides and the varroa mite .
In France , beekeepers have for more than a decade waged a war against the chemical giant Bayer CropScience .
They hold responsible the company 's bestselling pesticide , imidacloprid , trade name Gaucho , for killing a third of the country 's 1.5 million colonies .
In 1999 , the French government banned the use of Gaucho on sunflower crops after thousands took to the streets in protest .
Two further pesticides were banned because of their potential link to bee deaths .
It appeared to stem the massive bee die - offs for a time , even though the manufacturers ' own tests demonstrated there is no correlation , and a long - term study by the French food safety agency revealed no significant differences in death rates before and after pesticides were banned .
This winter , bee deaths across France are reported to have shot up again to 60 % .
Bayer is also being blamed by German beekeepers for the eerie silence along the Rhine valley , where the buzzing of bees is a common sound at this time of year .
They say two - thirds of honeybees have been killed this month by the pesticide clothianidin , sold under the trade name Poncho , which has been widely applied on sweet corn .
As a result of the bee deaths , eight pesticides , including clothianidin , have been temporarily suspended in Germany .
Anecdotal evidence of pesticide - related bee deaths in Italy and Holland is also piling up .
European beekeepers accuse scientists and government agencies of being in the pocket of the chemical companies .
It 's a similar story in the US , where scientists maintain that there is no correlation between the bees ' disappearance and pesticide use .
According to Hackenberg : " Big Ag has control of the USDA [ the US Department of Agriculture ] from the secretary right down to the lowest guy on the totem pole . "
Jeff Pettis is not sure where he comes on the pole .
The senior manager at the federal bee laboratory in Maryland , he 's the man responsible for coordinating the US government 's response to CCD .
Pettis advises some beekeepers may do well to forgo the almond pollination and rest their bees .
" You are getting them ready for February when the sunlight hours and the temperature are telling them it's too early in the year to be foraging at full strength , " he says .
Deceiving bees is an essential part of the business .
Beekeepers dupe them into thinking it 's already summer by moving them to warm locations in winter and feeding them an array of protein and energy supplements .
The more food that comes into the hive , the more eggs the queen lays , to create more of the worker bees to go out and pollinate .
The bee broker Joe Traynor says the deception goes much further than trucking bees south .
" We 're interfering with their natural cycle because we want strong colonies for almond pollination .
We 're stimulating hives in August , September and October , and making the queens do a lot more laying .
As a result the queens are suffering burnout .
It used to be that a beekeeper could pretty much leave his bees alone during winter .
That 's no longer the case . "
Moreover , scientists funded by the Almond Board of California are now experimenting with artificial pheromones that trick bees into thinking there are more larvae in the hive that need feeding , so they forage more , and in the process pollinate more almond blossom .
This is the Almond Board 's profit - driven response to a potential shortfall of honeybees : to work even harder those that remain .
Bees are being treated as a machine with no consideration for their life cycle and downtimes .
And any machine pushed to its limits and not well maintained will break .
Environmentalists argue for conservation measures on land planted with single crops that will both improve honeybee nutrition and attract wild pollinators that could shoulder some of the honeybees ' workload .
Monoculture , the hallmark of modern agriculture , covers much of the world 's 1.5 bn hectares of arable land .
Single - crop plantations and orchards can stretch for hundreds of kilometres .
The advantages for the farmer are manifold : the crop blooms at the same time , can be treated with the same pesticides and can be harvested together for maximum efficiency .
But for honeybees , pollen collected from one crop does not provide a balanced , nutritious diet .
Scientists agree that malnourished bees are more susceptible to disease and pesticide poisoning , while the best - fed are the hardiest .
Planting hedgerows of wild flowers would give honeybees a more varied menu .
While this has happened in Europe , US almond growers have proved resistant to the idea , concerned that the bees would make fewer visits to the almond blossom if they had a choice .
But hedgerows would also provide food and habitat for other pollinators such as butterflies , bumblebees and solitary bees .
There are 4,500 wild bee species in North America that are capable of pollinating myriad fruits and vegetables - some more efficiently than honeybees .
Could they prevent a pollination crisis if honeybees become extinct ?
Only if they have somewhere to make a home in the orchards and fields , and something to eat after the single crop has bloomed .
Monoculture deprives them on both counts .
The Xerces Society runs a pollinator conservation project in northern California .
Farms in Yolo County receive a mixture of plants that flower throughout the year and nest blocks for wild bees , and they keep large areas of soil untilled for native bees to live on .
They say they have seen the return of native bees and benefited from their pollination services .
But final details being hammered out in a farm bill on Capitol Hill look like trimming conservation budgets and reducing financial incentives for farmers to manage their land in a more pollinator - friendly way .
So growers will continue to be increasingly reliant on honeybees to do a job once performed by a host of different insects .
Their profits now hinge as much on honeybees ' availability to pollinate fields as they do on the sun and rain .
This is why there is such urgency in solving the mystery of disappearing and dying bees .
This is not the first time that honeybees have disappeared .
The first recorded unexplained loss was in the US 150 years ago and ever since large numbers have vanished at intervals throughout North America , Europe and Australia .
An epidemic first reported on the Isle of Wight wiped out 90 % of honeybee colonies in the UK at the beginning of the 20th century .
Then , as now , the main suspects were deficiencies in the bees ' diet , pollution in the environment , pests and parasites and mismanagement by beekeepers , but the killer was never identified .
When bees die , beekeepers can restock their hives quickly by buying a new queen who lays 2,000 eggs a day at her peak .
Across the world , most have chosen to fill their apiaries with a type of honeybee renowned for its gentle nature and prodigious honey production skills .
This race of bee , originally from Italy , now dominates beekeeping .
The downside is that the honeybee gene pool has been diminished and with it traits that may have helped bees fend off mites and other parasites , such as a new fungal bacteria , Nosema ceranae , that attacks its gut .
There are fears that mites are becoming increasingly resistant to chemicals administered by beekeepers to kill them .
Pettis says we are controlling too many bee ailments with drugs and a more organic approach is needed that includes stocking apiaries with locally reared bees better adapted to local climate and environmental conditions .
Meanwhile scientists are hoping to use the mapping of the honeybee genome to engineer in the laboratory a super bee that has the resilience to withstand varroa but retains all the qualities of the Italian bee .
Biologists will tell you , however , that it will be only a matter of time before a super bee breeds a super parasite .
Geneticists also discovered that honeybees have fewer genes providing resistance to disease than other insects .
In particular , the number of genes responsible for detoxification appear to be smaller , making it unusually sensitive to pesticides and poisons .
Its large - scale disappearance across the US and high death rates in Europe are signalling that industrialised farming makes demands on honeybees that are not sustainable .
Central Valley has been described as a big brothel where billions of honeybees from all over the US can pick up a contagious illness and take it home .
It 's spread by mites from infected to healthy colonies .
And there are plans to expand Central Valley 's almond orchards to the point where , by 2011 , they will require 1.6 million honeybee colonies for pollination .
Despite around a third of all US honeybees being wiped out last year , and again this year after beekeepers had restocked their hives , the almond pollination has yet to suffer .
Why ?
There are two answers .
The shortage of honeybees has pushed up the price of hive rentals for almond pollination to an all - time high of $ 140 per hive , so more and more beekeepers are making the trip west , and the Almond Board 's requirement of two hives each containing 20,000 - 30,000 bees per acre to pollinate the almonds is excessive , but provides a buffer should some of the hives be empty .
As the sun rises over the almond orchards after another nocturnal delivery of east coast hives , Hackenberg says it 's only the money that brings him and his waning bees to California each year .
" I 'd rather be back in Florida with my bees .
They'd be feeding on the maple and willow .
It 's paradise down there .
Why would anyone come to this godforsaken place ?
But something 's got to pay the bills .
I 'm here for a $ 150,000 cheque . "

The brothers starting writing games at an early age
Enlarge Image
Two of the pioneers of the UK video games industry have been recognised in the Queen 's Birthday Honours .
David and Richard Darling , co-founders of game developers Codemasters , were both made Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) .
They built up their company from a bedroom enterprise into one of the best known games developers in the world .
The firm is behind well established titles including the Colin McRae Rally series and Sensible Soccer .
More recently the firm has ventured into online games , releasing Lord of the Rings Online .
" For over 20 years David and Richard led Codemasters as it became one of the video game industry 's great British success stories , " said Rod Cousens , present head of Codemasters .
" Their drive and passion for creating the best in interactive entertainment will always be part of the industry 's heritage and this recognition is well deserved . "
The brothers sold their stake in the company in 2007 after 21 years at the firm .
' Brilliant games '
The two brothers started their first company - Galactic Software - in 1982 , followed by a stint writing for Mastertronic , a publisher of low - cost computer software .
The firm made a series of simulator titles following their first release
In 1986 they set up Codemasters , along with their father Jim .
Their first title was BMX simulator , released in the company 's founding year .
There followed a series of simulator titles including jet ski , flight and even fruit machine games .
Many of these were written for the computer of the moment - the ZX spectrum - although they also produced titles for the BBC Micro , Acorn Electron and Amstrad CPC .
The brothers were famous for putting ringing endorsements of their games on the packaging .
" Dizzy 's Treasure Island is brilliant - it 's like a real cartoon but with amazing gameplay , " read one .
These were usually quotes from the creators of the game or the Darling brothers themselves .
The Treasure Island quote was by David Darling , for example .
Practices like this drew equal measures of mirth and criticism from the games press of the time .
But the company gained even greater notoriety when it developed a series of unlicensed games for Nintendo 's Entertainment System .
The titles , published by controversial company Camerica , bypassed the console 's so - called " lock - out chip " , designed to prevent unofficial products being played .
Titles included the Quattro Series , Ultimate Stuntman and the best - selling Micro Machines .
The company has continued to grow and now produces games for all three major consoles , PCs , handheld devices and mobile phones .
In 2005 the company was crowned the world 's leading independently owned video games developer by Develop Magazine .
The brothers left two years later to work on other projects .
They were honoured for their " services to the computer games industry " .

The Aardappel Programming Language
Concurrent Tree Space Transformation
The research I ’ve done for my PhD ( ‘ 96 - 2000 ) involves designing and implementing a new language , which computes by concurrently reducing trees ( using a form of tree - rewriting ) which sit together in tree - spaces ( bags ) and communicate amongst eachother ( exchanging parts of themselves , in Linda - like fashion ) .
The language is 100 % graphical and linear as well .
My thesis on this topic : ( pdf ) , and the first public version of the implementation ( zip ) .
UPDATE : now on github .
And now … some confusing pictures :
This is an actual screenshot of the beta implementation ( written in Java , and compiling to JVM bytecode ) .
Here are 2 larger , more complicated programs : a prolog interpreter and a mandelbrot renderer .
This is how I imagined it would look before I implemented it .
Here are 3 more ( very old ) mock ups , included only for completeness sake : 1 2 3 .

The concept of time - travel is laden with uncomfortable paradoxes
Researchers speculate that time travel can occur within a kind of feedback loop where backwards movement is possible , but only in a way that is " complementary " to the present .
In other words , you can pop back in time and have a look around , but you cannot do anything that will alter the present you left behind .
The new model , which uses the laws of quantum mechanics , gets rid of the famous paradox surrounding time travel .
Paradox explained
Although the laws of physics seem to permit temporal gymnastics , the concept is laden with uncomfortable contradictions .
The main headache stems from the idea that if you went back in time you could , theoretically , do something to change the present ; and that possibility messes up the whole theory of time travel .
Clearly , the present never is changed by mischievous time - travellers : people do n't suddenly fade into the ether because a rerun of events has prevented their births - that much is obvious .
You go back to kill your father , but you 'd arrive after he'd left the room , you would n't find him , or you 'd change your mind
Professor Dan Greenberger , City University , New York
For most of us , the former option might seem most likely , but Einstein 's general theory of relativity leads some physicists to suspect the latter .
According to Einstein , space - time can curve back on itself , theoretically allowing travellers to double back and meet younger versions of themselves .
And now a team of physicists from the US and Austria says this situation can only be the case if there are physical constraints acting to protect the present from changes in the past .
Weird laws
The researchers say these constraints exist because of the weird laws of quantum mechanics even though , traditionally , they do n't account for a backwards movement in time .
Quantum behaviour is governed by probabilities .
Before something has actually been observed , there are a number of possibilities regarding its state .
But once its state has been measured those possibilities shrink to one - uncertainty is eliminated .
So , if you know the present , you can not change it .
If , for example , you know your father is alive today , the laws of the quantum universe state that there is no possibility of him being killed in the past .
It is as if , in some strange way , the present takes account of all the possible routes back into the past and , because your father is certainly alive , none of the routes back can possibly lead to his death .
" Quantum mechanics distinguishes between something that might happen and something that did happen , " Professor Dan Greenberger , of the City University of New York , US , told the BBC News website .
" If we do n't know your father is alive right now - if there is only a 90 % chance that he is alive right now , then there is a chance that you can go back and kill him .
" But if you know he is alive , there is no chance you can kill him . "
In other words , even if you take a trip back in time with the specific intention of killing your father , so long as you know he is happily sitting in his chair when you leave him in the present , you can be sure that something will prevent you from murdering him in the past .
It is as if it has already happened .
" You go back to kill your father , but you 'd arrive after he'd left the room , you would n't find him , or you 'd change your mind , " said Professor Greenberger .
" You would n't be able to kill him because the very fact that he is alive today is going to conspire against you so that you 'll never end up taking that path leads you to killing him . "
Greenberger and colleague Karl Svozil introduce their quantum mechanical model of time travel on the ArXiv e-print service .

The US and its allies are worried that the sanctions regime against Tehran is under threat from a possible new wave of European investment in Iran ’s strategically important gas sector .
Tehran has already concluded gas deals with Chinese and Malaysian companies – ending a protracted lull in investment in its energy sector – and has alarmed Washington by reaching an agreement with a Swiss group .
The dilemma threatens to expose the limited US influence over foreign companies strategic decisions .
Although Washington and its allies have convinced the United Nations Security Council to sign up to three sets of sanctions against Iran ’s nuclear and missile sectors and banks , it has been unable to broaden such international measures into the key energy sector .
Now , the US fears that a 25 - year supply agreement concluded in March between Elektrizitäts - Gesellschaft Laufenburg ( EGL ) of Switzerland and Iran could encourage other deals , particularly in the gas sector , despite American calls for tougher sanctions against Tehran over its controversial nuclear program .
The Swiss government says the deal could be worth up to € 27bn ( $ 42bn , £ 21bn ) .
“ The worry is that the Swiss deal will lead others , such as the Austrians , to confirm energy investments in Iran , and that companies like [ France ’s ]
Total could then follow suit and sign contracts of their own , ” said one western diplomat .
He pointed out that the EGL agreement ended a period in which European energy companies had largely confined themselves to agreeing only non-binding memoranda of understanding with Iran .
He added : “ There is a lot of attention on sanctions on Iranian banks , but investment in the energy sector is much more important for Iran ’s economy . ”
Iran has the world ’s second - largest proven gas reserves , but exports far below its potential .
Flynt Leverett , a former US National Security Council adviser on the Middle East , says pressure is growing on non-US companies to conclude supply contracts with Iran in the wake of the deals already signed between Tehran and Sinopec of China and SKS of Malaysia .
So angry is Washington about the Swiss deal that it has suggested that Switzerland ’s role as the US representative in Cuba and Iran could be at risk .
Swiss officials reply that no international sanctions prohibit investment in the Iranian energy sector , and that the gas supply contract signed by EGL is intended to alleviate energy shortages in Italy .
“ For almost 30 years , Switzerland has rendered good services to the US as their protecting power in Iran , ” said a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman .
Following the deal , some European leaders have voiced concern about new investment in liquefied natural gas , the sector in which groups such as Total , Royal Dutch Shell and Austria ’s OMV have struck preliminary agreements but have yet to sign formal contracts .
Iran has warned such companies they need to conclude deals by June or it will look elsewhere for investment .
European diplomats say it is unlikely that the EU will agree formal sanctions on the Iranian energy sector in the immediate future .
Under US law , investments of above $ 20 m ( €13 m , £ 10 m ) in Iran ’s energy sector can lead to US retaliatory measures , But Mr. Leverett said Washington ’s options were limited .
“ The EU would effectively take us to court [ at the World Trade Organization ] and the US would probably lose , ” he said .
Hojatollah Ghanimifard , head of international affairs at the National Iranian Oil Company , said Tehran was legitimately supplying an international need .
“ Would it be wise to deprive common people of consuming countries of supplies from Iran ? ” he asked .

The McCain campaign is doing their best to turn the story about the leader of Obama ’s VP search committee , Jim Johnson receiving a mortgage loan from Countrywide into a major scandal .
The Obama campaign called McCain ’s huffing and puffing , “ an overblown story about what appear to be completely above - board transactions . ”
The McCain campaign did n’t like this so they put out a follow up statement , “ There is nothing ‘ overblown and irrelevant ’ about millions of Americans facing foreclosure and Barack Obama entrusting his most important decision as a presidential candidate to a man who has accepted millions in special loans from a subprime mortgage lender .
The Obama campaign ’s reaction is even more appalling considering that they were the first to criticize the Clinton campaign for ties to Countrywide and subprime lenders .
It might be ‘ overblown ’ to ask that Barack Obama ’s actions match his rhetoric .
Apparently , fixing the housing crisis begins with the Obama campaign . ”
Through spokesperson Tommy Vietor the Obama camp called McCain a hypocrite , “ It ’s the height of hypocrisy for the McCain campaign to try and make this an issue when John Green , one of John McCain ’s top advisors , lobbied for Ameriquest , which was one of the nation ’s largest subprime lenders and a key player in the mortgage crisis .
As President , Senator Obama will crack down on fraudulent lenders and bring real relief to Americans struggling in the grip of the housing crisis , the kind of change that works for the American people . ”

It seems that the McCain campaign is grasping at straws here .
They are using what appears to have been a legal loan to one of Obama ’s advisors to question his character .
This criticism is coming from a campaign that barely has a passing interest in the mortgage crisis .
It is also a campaign whose candidate first suggested that the government do nothing and let the market work itself out , so it is hard to take John McCain seriously as a defender of the millions of homeowners who are either at risk , or have already lost their homes .
Has the McCain campaign already gotten desperate to take Obama down ?

“ After June 3 , this is going to come to a conclusion , ” Mr. McAuliffe said on NBC ’s “ Today ” program .
Other Clinton allies said much the same thing , evidence of a consensus that Mrs. Clinton has four weeks to make her case but then should exit quickly if she has not turned the race around .
Her campaign grappled with a number of impediments to fighting on , including a decline in fund - raising .
“ I think she should complete the primary season , and then she has to re-evaluate and her supporters have to re-evaluate , ” said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York , a Clinton backer .
Mr. Obama made no public effort to pressure Mrs. Clinton from the race , and in interviews with CNN and NBC News he praised her as a formidable candidate who could not yet be counted out .
But he said that he was likely to lock up a majority of the pledged delegates  those awarded by voting in the primary and caucus states  after the Kentucky and Oregon primaries on May 20 , and that at that point he could declare victory .
While he was respectful to Mrs. Clinton , Mr. Obama seemed eager to challenge Mr. McCain .
Asked on CNN about Mr. McCain ’s recent statement that the radical Palestinian party Hamas , considered by the United States to be a terrorist organization , would favor Mr. Obama ’s election , Mr. Obama said it was offensive and called it a smear .
“ And so for him to toss out comments like that I think is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination , ” Mr. Obama said .
Is the fix in at the NBA ?
Are some title games rigged ?
Ex -NBA official , Tim Donaghy says they are .
The question is , do we believe him ?
Or is he merely making noise in hopes of getting a lighter prison sentence on July 14th , when he is scheduled to be sentenced ?
Donaghy is the NBA referee that was arrested last summer by the FBI for gambling and conspiring with gamblers on NBA games .
He was fired by the NBA , he subsequently pleaded guilty to lesser charges and he has been cooperating with the government in order to obtain a lighter sentence .
According to a just released letter from his attorney to the court , Donaghy said NBA executives instructed certain referees “ to manipulate games ” to “ boost ticket sales and television ratings . ”
Donaghy gave specific examples but withheld team names .
Donaghy mentioned Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference finals as one example .
That game was between the LA Lakers and the Sacramento Kings .
One flagrant foul that was never called stands out from the rest .
Laker Kobe Bryant clearly elbowed Sacramento's Mike Bibby , sending Bibby to the floor bleeding .
Yet no foul was called , which caused King fans to claim the fix was in .
Now Donaghy is saying the fans were right .
In that game , the Lakers shot a total of 40 free throws , but 27 were in the final quarter .
The Lakers won that game 106 - 102 and went on to win game 7 and , eventually , the NBA championship title .
If a referee wants to favor one team over another , all he has to do is call a few extra fouls against the unfavored team and fewer fouls against the favored team .
That gives his favored team extra free throws and extra points and the exact opposite for the unfavored team .
The following is a Sacramento area newscast regarding Donaghy 's allegations .
That is what Donaghy claims happened in game six between the Lakers and the Kings in 2002 , and the media and fans wanted the referees ' heads after that game .
Many Kings fans claimed then that the fix was in , and even today , six years later , some still cite that game as the smoking gun proving that officials manipulate key NBA games .
Donaghy also stated that it has happened in other games too .
During the 2005 playoff series between the Dallas Mavericks and the Houston Rockets , Jeff Van Gundy , who was then the Rockets ' coach , stated publicly that an NBA official had privately told him that his star 7 ' 6 " center , Yao Ming , would be singled out by referees for illegal screens during the series .
The NBA fined Van Gundy $ 100,000 for that remark .
But Donaghy 's letter states “ the referees followed the league instructions and Team 3 came back from behind to win the series .
The N.B.A. benefited from this , because it prolonged the series , resulting in more tickets sold and more televised games . ”
What is the NBA 's reply to these accusations ?
NBA Commissioner David Stern has refused to give any credibility to Donaghy 's charges .
Stern dismissed Donaghy 's allegations as baseless and said that the accusations come from the mouth of an admitted felon .
“ He turned on basically all of his colleagues in an attempt to demonstrate that he is not the only one who engaged in criminal activity , ” Stern said .
“ The US attorney ’s office , the FBI have fully investigated it , and Mr. Donaghy is the only one who is guilty of a crime .
And he ’s going to be sentenced for that crime , regardless of these desperate attempts to implicate as many people as he can . ”
And so far , he is correct .
No other charges have yet been filed by the FBI , despite their investigations .
But when officiating decides the outcome of games instead of plays , you cannot fault the public for holding their noses from the stink .
Claims of NBA game rigging have been floating around for years .
Donaghy 's latest statements will certainly do nothing but stir up the pot on this controversy .

Just the right thickness but not the book I expected !
On page 7 of the official VA report , the number of U.S. soldiers partaking in the illegal invasion of the Gulf is listed as 6,838,541 soldiers .
Just below that the VA estimated number of living soldiers is listed at 4,525,865 .
In other words 2,312,676 US Gulf War Veterans are dead !
Not many active duty soldiers serving from 1990 are likely to have died from old age or natural causes by April 2007 .
The report details deaths in various conflicts as reported to the VA by DoD , utterly contradicting the government and mainstream media number of 4,000 dead .
Just below these numbers the report indicates that 1,603,743 Gulf
War soldiers filed for disability and
1,206,795 soldiers have been classified as disabled !
2,312,676 dead + 1,206,795 disabled = 3,519,471 soldiers out of it out of 6,838,541 total
More than half U.S. soldiers who partook in the illegal Gulf War are dead or disabled !
The illegal invasion of Iraq by the United States of America will go down in history as one of the most disastrous wars of all time .
Well over a million innocent Iraqi's are dead and more than four million have lost their homes .
While the thousands of tons of nuclear dirty bombs ( DU ) blasted into the Gulf by U.S. forces represents the most violent out of control use of Weapons of Mass Destruction ever .
The U.S. DU will continue killing for billions of years and many more of our soldiers and their family members and Iraqis ' will die as a consequence .
The official Department of Veterans Affairs report can be found at http://www1.va.gov/rac-gwvi/docs/GWVIS_Aug2007.pdf
Reasons why so many U.S. soldiers are dead can be found on the www.libertryforlife.com site along with the reasons why the U.S. government , courts and military is controlled by a group of Lucifer worshiping criminals and bankers who have not only stolen our Nation they have also stolen our homes and businesses .

About this document
This is an advanced graduate course focussed on synchronization - related topics in operating systems .
The course is based on research papers , and will involve a lot of reading and assimilation of ideas .
The reading list has been carefully selected from classical and recent research papers in order to introduce and develop the key concepts and developments in synchronization and shared memory multiprocessor operating system design .
These concepts include various uses of locking in OS kernels , synchronization in interrupt and process contexts , issues in the design of scalable spin locks , scalable reader - writer locking , lock - free and non-blocking synchronization , software transactional memory , hazard pointers , read copy update , memory consistency models and their implications for the performance and correctness of synchronization , tools and techniques for checking for bugs in synchronization - related kernel code .
You will be required to read each paper carefully , write a brief summary of it , and submit it before the start of each class .
Each student will be assigned one or more papers to present in class .
These presentations , your in - class participation and paper summaries will contribute directly to your grade .
The goal of this class is not only to help you learn about different systems , but also to learn how to read and evaluate a research paper , how to compose a concise summary of a research paper , and how to synthesize concepts and ideas across several papers .
Toward the end of the class each student will write a short position paper describing their views on the current and future directions of operating systems research , particularly in so far as they relate to the topics covered in class .
News of the rumored layoffs at LucasArts that we broke yesterday afternoon were confirmed today by the developer , which maintained that they remain committed to their internal studio .

" I can confirm we had layoffs yesterday they were in the studio , " said LucasArts spokeswoman Margaret Grohne .
" They had to do with where we are in our product life cycles . "

Yesterday a number of former LucasArts staffers contacted us to say that 75 to 100 employees were laid off from the company , including VP of Product Development Peter Hirschmann and the producer of LEGO Indiana Jones and LEGO Star Wars : The Complete Saga , Shawn Storc .
The layoffs come months after former president Jim Ward stepped down from heading the company and was replaced by Darrell Rodriguez , a former Electronic Arts COO .

According to our sources up to 80 percent of staff has been laid off in departments such as Production Services , which includes QA and Compliance , with jobs planned to be outsourced overseas .
Cuts were also said to be made in development , with art and programming staffers being laid off .

While our sources told us that the layoffs cut deeply into the developer 's internal studio , leaving the company short - staffed , Grohne maintained that the company is healthy and remains committed to internal development .
" We are healthy , " she said .
" LEGO Indie was launched on seven platforms to positive reviews , The Force Unleashed and Fracture are on track for this fall .
We have a good slate of games and we have some good stuff going on in production .

May 27 , 2008  --
The Democratic primary war will end within days of next week 's final primary votes when " several dozen " superdelegates will end their silence and endorse Sen.
Barack Obama , ABC 's chief political correspondent George Stephanopoulos reported Tuesday .
When asked by " Good Morning America " what the chances are of Sen.
Hillary Clinton continuing her fight for the nomination into the Democrats ' August convention , Stephanopoulos replied , " Zero . "
" There 's so many superdelegates out there who agreed with what Jimmy Carter said , " Stephanopoulos said .
Former President Carter said last week that once the voting was over he felt that " at that point it will be time for her to give it up . "
" Once these contests are done , you 'll see several dozen superdelegates go his [ Obama 's ] way following June 3 , " Stephanopoulos said .
That surge of support will be enough to put Obama 's delegate count over the top and allow him to claim the nomination , he said .
In Puerto Rico with her family , Clinton continued to hold out hope and to jab at Obama .
" The real test is not what we say , but what we do .
The real challenge is how we cannot just make speeches that contain promise , but deliver on those promises .
It is for me a sacred obligation , " Clinton said .
Race Approaches Finish Line
Her long - shot bid now boils down to three key dates this week .
Saturday : The Democratic National Committee will decide what to do about the delegates from Michigan and Florida , which held early contests not recognized by the party .
The ruling could change the number of delegates needed to win the nomination .
" What 's almost certain is the DNC will not do what the Clinton campaign wants , which is reinstate Florida and Michigan , " Stephanopoulos said on " Good Morning America . "
He describes " the most likely outcomes " as a " calculation that penalizes Michigan and Florida by 50 percent . "
Clinton won both states , although the candidates had agreed not to campaign there and the national party said their votes would n't count .
Clinton is hoping those states get included to boost her delegate count and push her popular vote total ahead of Obama's .
In South Dakota this weekend , former President Clinton touted his wife as the best Democrat to take on presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain in the general election .
Delegate Math
" They 're trying to get her to cry uncle before the Democratic Party has to decide what to do in Florida and Michigan because they are claiming that it only takes 2,029 votes on the first ballot to win , and it takes a lot more than that if you put Florida and Michigan back in , " Clinton said .
" They will have to [ include Florida and Michigan ] unless we want to lose the election . "
Sunday : The Puerto Rico primary .
Campaigning in the U.S. territory where 55 pledged delegates are at stake , Clinton has been defending the island 's right to vote though citizens of Puerto Rico do not pay federal income taxes .
" I believe it is long past time that we give the people of Puerto Rico , U.S. citizens all , an equal voice in the vote for the commander in chief who sends young Puerto Ricans to war , " the New York senator said .
Clinton is favored to win in Puerto Rico .
June 3 : The final two contests in Montana and South Dakota , where 31 pledged delegates are at stake .
A Super End ?
And then ?
Carter says he and other superdelegates will show Clinton the door .
" I think a lot of the superdelegates will make a decision quite , announced quite rapidly , after the final primary on June 3 , " Carter said in an interview with Sky News in London .
" I have not yet announced publicly , but I think at that point it will be time for her to give it up . "
Carter said he did n't think Clinton was achieving anything by staying in the race but added " of course she has the perfect right to do so . "
Obama Moves Past Dem Race
Though ahead in the delegate count with 1,975 to Clinton 's 1,773 , Obama , the Democratic front - runner , has still not yet won the nomination .
Whether or not it looks presumptuous , he is now campaigning not in primary states but general election states like Nevada , Colorado and New Mexico .
What Is a Rogue Trader ?
A rogue trader is a trader who acts recklessly and independently of others , usually to the detriment of the institution that employs the trader and perhaps clients .
Rogue traders typically play with high - risk investments that can produce huge losses or gains .
Rogue traders , though , are only labeled as such if they lose , which generates incentives that create moral hazard .
If their trades are enormously profitable , no one calls them " rogue " , and in fact they are more likely to receive a huge bonus - but if they 're risky bets lose they are rogue and can cost the firm millions or even billions of dollars in losses .
Key Takeaways
A rogue trader is an employee of a financial firm who engages in unauthorized , often high - risk activities that result in large losses for the firm .
Rogue traders often try to hide losses after making risky bets since there is a moral hazard situation : if the bet pays off they can earn huge bonuses , if it fails they 'll only get fired .
Famous examples of rogue traders exist , some of which have lost billions of dollars and even brought down otherwise large and stable banks or brokerages .
Rogue Traders Explained
Banks over the years have developed sophisticated Value - at - Risk ( VaR ) models to control the trading of instruments — which desks can trade them , when they can trade them , and how much in a given period .
In particular , the limit of a trade is carefully set and monitored , not only to protect the bank but also to satisfy regulators .
Internal controls , however , are not 100 % foolproof .
A determined trader can find a way to circumvent the system to try to reap outsized gains .
Often they are caught in bad trades and then forced by regulators to be publicly exposed — to the embarrassment of the bank .
One has to wonder how many small - time rogue traders are quietly fired by a bank because the bank does not want the negative publicity that comes with news that internal trading controls were not properly developed or implemented .
Examples of Rogue Traders
Among the most notorious rogue traders in recent years is Nick Leeson , a former derivatives trader at the Singapore office of Britain 's Barings Bank .
In 1995 , Leeson incurred heavy losses through the unauthorized trading of large amounts of Nikkei futures and options .
Leeson took large derivative positions on the Nikkei that leveraged the amount of money at stake in the trades .
At one point , Leeson had 20,000 futures contracts worth more than $ 3 billion on the Nikkei .
A large chunk of the losses came from the downturn in the Nikkei after a major earthquake in Japan caused a broad - based sell - off in the Nikkei within a week .
The total loss to the 233 - year - old Barings Bank was well over $ 1 billion and eventually led to its bankruptcy .
Leeson was charged with fraud and served several years in a Singapore prison .
More recent examples include Bruno Iksil , the " London Whale " who racked up $ 6.2 billion in losses in 2012 at JP Morgan , and Jerome Kerviel , who was partly or wholly responsible for more than $ 7 billion in losses at Société Générale in 2007 .
JP Morgan CEO Jaime Dimon was slow to realize the magnitude of the " London Whale " losses , first calling the incident " a tempest in a teapot . "
Later , to his chagrin , he had to admit the truth about his bank 's rogue trader .
Online world firm Trion World Network has revealed its first projects - including a Jon Von Caneghem - helmed fantasy themed MMO , and a Sci -Fi Channel co-developed online game to intertwine with a TV series , as the company becomes a licensed PS3 developer and publisher .
The firm , headed by EA veteran CEO Lars Buttler andcreator and chief creative officer John Van Caneghem , will deliver games developed by both its internal studios and external partners via its Trion Platform , which is compatible with broadband - enabled PCs and PlayStation 3 systems .
Delivering what Trion calls " server - based games " , the user will have a client which handles I/O and rendering , while content - which can be changed dynamically - is stored on servers and fed to the clients as needed .
Games will initially be delivered via download , retail , and other distribution methods -- with Buttler alluding to the possibility of free AOL - disc - like distribution methods for the client .
Different " channels " , which are essentially different game titles , will be maintained on Trion 's server , and deliver that dynamic content to users depending on which " channel " they engage with .
The first newly announced game for the Trion Network platform is a currently - unnamed fantasy MMORPG developed under Van Caneghem in Trion 's Redwood Shores , California studio .
No specific details about the game were revealed , but Trion 's promises " battles of enormous scale will create epic moments that an unprecedented number of players can participate in . "
It will be published by Trion in both North America and Europe , and promises dynamic content -- a feature at the core of the Trion Platform experience .
During its presentation to Gamasutra , Buttler and Van Caneghem showed a short video presentation to give a better idea of this dynamic content .
Though it was not meant to represent a specific product or partnership , it depicted a fantasy - MMO like world which smoothly changed into a cartoony action - platformer .
The second project in development at Trion encompasses a " dynamic , connected " cross-media franchise which encompasses both a Sci -Fi Channel television show and a Trion - published game , in development at Trion 's San Diego studio , with ex-Sony Online Entertainment staffer Bill Trost as lead designer .
To further explore the workings of the Trion Platform , Gamasutra conducted an interview with Buttler and Van Caneghem after the presentation .
John van Caneghem :
It depends on the game , but yes there is .
You need all the graphics .
We 're not sending , obviously , video feed or anything like that .
The clients themselves are basically rendering devices , and I /O devices .
But all the rest of the game is being simulated on the server .
For a big RPG , you 're going to need all the art assets on your machine .
That 's why we talked about DVD distributions or downloads .
Lars Buttler : Or retail .
All the ways of getting it .
JVC : So for a big 3D action game , you 're going to have a big download .
LB : Normal size .
Big , but dumb .
It 's not doing much .
The ' smarts ' are in the cloud .
JVC : Art and sound , yes .
Sound 's huge , too .
JVC : That 's a great question , but regular broadband .
LB : Lowest DSL connection .JVC : Yeah , a low DSL connection .
Not a dial - up though .
LB : It takes more bandwidth for any voice chat in any existing game , than you need for that .
It 's built really smartly , the way the servers communicate with the client .
We really think you have to have a world of broadband , but you can do it with today 's devices , and with today 's broadband speeds , and today 's latencies .
Everything beyond : new devices coming online , faster pipes , lower latencies , is upside for us .
But everything we want to do , we can do today .
JVC : Well , even for large scale games , I think we want to use all forms of distribution .
It 's about getting it into as many people 's hands to try it .
We do n't want to sell the client .
We want the client to be given away .
With our retail box we can give added incentives like an X month subscription , or extra special items .
We have a money system for buying extra items .
LB : Yeah , it 's a fully dynamic platform , so you can have different products for different channels that still make sense for those different channels .
JVC :
The real idea is , let 's stop the fifty or sixty dollar barrier of entry to try products that are online , and let people try them .
Whether they download them or they pick up a low price - point retail item that just saves them the download time -- or one that they really want that has extra stuff in it , like collectors ' editions -- just get them to try the game .
Once they 're trying the game , there 's lots of ways for monetizing past that , but it 's not about just selling the box anymore .
That 's been really ratified with what 's happening in Asia , of course .
LB : Yeah , some games have different lead business models and different lead platforms , but you 're totally right that a more lightweight , casual experience is very different .
JVC : The latter is correct .
The platform is the server architecture , not anything that 's really on the client .
Those are game - specific pieces of the architecture .
LB : The platform is the whole backbone .
JVC : Absolutely .
If you think about it , because the games are all running on servers in our database architecture , it 's much , much easier to allow access to everything -- social networking , players ' web pages -- all sorts of interconnectivity on all sorts of different devices .
That 's half the reason why our architecture is like this , versus so much in clients .
Right now it 's very difficult for current online games to allow people to have any interconnectivity to them .
It 's a big re-write .
And it 's a big re-write for each application , whereas we 've taken the next giant step of , " Oh , okay , we want a phone application , we want a web application , we want something that talks to your MySpace page . "
It 's very easy for us to do .
JVC : That 's a great question .
And then there are different tiers of change obviously .
So , we have a whole category of what the designers can change instantly , what they can change that has swappable assets , and then more of a bigger picture of what people have to have already received down on their machine .
LB : Which they get as a background download .
JVC : We have some real clever ways of doing that , so that there 's redundancies , and there 's a way that most everyone can enjoy anything that 's going on without having a , " Hey , you do n't have this , " situation .
We 've taken great lengths to prevent that .
So , on the high - end , if you think about it , anything you already have , obviously we can change .
That 's already immensely powerful -- gameplay , quests , events , and combat , a whole series of things .
Then we have on - the - fly capabilities , if you 're just thinking of speed of broadband and what they can get in terms of textures and sound .
There 's also big updates , like any other traditional game that does a patch .
We do it as just content , though , so it can come in the background .
It does n't prevent them from playing otherwise .
We can do those as periodically or as often we want .
I 'd say eighty percent of what we 're doing dynamically , there is n't any time delay or download at all .
JVC : Yeah .JVC : That 's correct .
That 's exactly right .
JVC : That 's a very different mentality for developers as well .
We 've had to retool a lot of our thinking in terms of how we built games for so long , and then everybody pushes to release , and then they move on to other titles .
Here , the idea is that the dev team stays steady - state after release to continually add stuff every day , and that way you do n't have to build all that stuff up front , like we just talked about earlier -- fifty - plus percent we did n't even know was right .
We build enough to make a great game and have people playing , and then if there 's stuff coming every day you have the ability to really go with the direction people are liking , as opposed to striking that bigger guess up front .
So it 's a two - fold win .
LB : And you have great gameplay .
You still build all the all the core game mechanics .
JVC : Yeah , it 's definitely pulling lessons learned from the different markets , on what works well and what people enjoy .
And obviously high - quality , both gameplay and production quality , are very important .
But it 's the tremendous stuff from the Asian markets , and the social gaming markets , that , applied to this space , is what keeps people playing for a long time .
LB : The answer is yes .
We really want to combine the best of online games and traditional media , right ?
From the traditional media we have this evolving , long - lasting evolving format , almost like a TV show .
From the online space , you really have a ton of social networking applications , other things .
Not just on our side , but also tying into the social networking world with widgets and other things .
We do n't see this as only as a destination , where this is the only way you get to experience it .
We really want to reach people everywhere .
It 's a larger , broader network .
We empower them to come through their Facebook profile , or come through their own website , or through our website , or directly through the game client , or any other way they want .
JVC : All of the developers we know want to build these type of games , and the traditional publishers do n't have an outlet for them .
We really want to be the destination for anyone who wants to build online server - based games .
The Motion Picture Association of America said Friday intellectual - property holders should have the right to collect damages , perhaps as much as $ 150,000 per copyright violation , without having to prove infringement .
" Mandating such proof could thus have the pernicious effect of depriving copyright owners of a practical remedy against massive copyright infringement in many instances , " MPAA attorney Marie L. van Uitert wrote Friday to the federal judge overseeing the Jammie Thomas trial .
" It is often very difficult , and in some cases , impossible , to provide such direct proof when confronting modern forms of copyright infringement , whether over P2P networks or otherwise ; understandably , copyright infringers typically do not keep records of infringement , " van Uitert wrote on behalf of the movie studios , a position shared with the Recording Industry Association of America , which sued Thomas , the single mother of two .
A Duluth , Minnesota , jury in October dinged Thomas $ 222,000 for " making available " 24 songs on the Kazaa network in the nation 's first and only RIAA case to go to trial .
United States District Court Judge Michael Davis instructed the 12 panelists that they need only find Thomas had an open share folder , not that anyone from the public actually copied her files .
( It is technologically infeasible to determine whether the public is copying an open share folder , although the RIAA makes its own downloads from defendants ' share folders , produces screen shots and , among other things , captures an IP address .
An Arizona judge ruled last month in a different case that those downloads count against a defendant , a one - of - a- kind decision being appealed on grounds that the RIAA was authorized to download its own music . )
Judge Davis suggestedlast month that he might have erred in giving that " making available " jury instruction , and invited briefing from the community at large .
A hearing is set for August , and the judge is mulling whether to order a mistrial .
The deadline to submit briefs to the judge was Friday .
Among the briefs , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Public Knowledge , the United States Internet Industry Association and the Computer and Communications Industry Association all jointly filed a brief , saying the law did not allow damages for " attempted " copyright infringement .
" Given the serious consequences that flow from copyright ’s strict liability regime , the court should resist plaintiffs imprecations to expand that regime absent an unequivocal expression of Congressional intent , " the groups wrote , noting that the language in the Copyright Act demands actual distribution to the public of protected works .
It was a similar brief in tone to the one that a group of 10 intellectual property scholars lodged earlier in the week .
But the MPAA , long an ally to the RIAA , which has sued more than 20,000 individuals for file sharing of copyrighted music , told Judge Davis that peer - to - peer users automatically should be liable for infringement .
" The only purpose for placing copyrighted works in the shared folder is , of course , to ' share , ' by making those works available to countless other P2P networks , " the MPAA wrote .
( Click here for Threat Level 's in - depth look at the Thomas case , its implications and Judge Davis ' decision to rethink his jury instruction . )
Other groups meeting Davis ' deadline include the Intellectual Property Institute at William Mitchell College of Law and the Progress & Freedom Foundation .

Scalaにはご存知のとおり scala.util.parsing.combinator というパーサコンビネータライブラリがある。さらには scala.util.parsing.ast
というのもあるわけだけど、これは激しく開発中な感じ。Scalaはバージョンがあがるとこういう開発中ライブラリはごそっと変わったりするので今はおいておく。ちなみに、2.7.1では前のパーサコンビネータは scala.util.parsing.combinatorold といういかにも使いたくない名前にされてしまった。
パーサコンビネータといえば言語処理系だ（そうか？）。というわけで scala.util.parsing.ast は置いておいて、とりあえずASTについてほとんど考える必要がない、簡単なスタック指向言語を実装してみることにする。実行はScala 2.7.1.finalで。
スタック指向言語と は
こんなブログを見ている人は、だいたいスタック指向言語を知っているだろうから俺みたいな素人が書いてもなんだけど、一応。
スタック指向言語にはForthやPostScriptやFactorがある。素晴らしく簡単にいうと、
「 とりあえずスタックがあればなんとかなるよね 」 という言語だ。
んでスタック使うなら逆ポーランドで書いてあったら、処理も楽だしいいんじゃね、読みにくい？Lispだって慣れてる人は無問題なんだし、慣れの問題じゃね、という感じである。
関数（スタック指向言語ではwordという）もスタックに値をつんで実行すればいい。wordから値を返すときも返したい分だけスタックにつめばいい。というわけで、非常に単純なのである。
今回は Factor ライクなスタック指向言語処理系（インタプリタ）「 SimpleFactor」を作ってみることに。文法とかはだいたいFactorと一緒なのでさきにFactorの文法を学んでおくと分かりやすい。
まずはレク サ
まずはレクサを作る。サポートするリテラルは文字列、整数値、真偽値で以下のような感じ。
文字列： " hoge "
整数値： 10 , -10
真偽値： t,
f
あと、コメントは !
から行末までとする。ソースはこんな感じで、ScalaのDSL構築能力を生かしてかなり定義どおりに書ける。
import scala.util.parsing.combinator._ import scala.util.parsing.combinator.syntactical ._ import scala.util.parsing.combinator.lexical._ import scala.util.parsing.input.CharArrayReader .EofCh class Lexer extends StdLexical with ImplicitConversions { override def token : Parser [ Token ] = ( string ^^ StringLit | '-' ~> number ^^ { case num => NumericLit ( " - " + num ) } | number ^^ NumericLit | EofCh ^^^ EOF | delim | '\ " ' ~> failure ( " Unterminated string " ) | rep( chrAny ) ^^ checkKeyword | failure ( " Illegal character " ) ) def number = zero | ( nonzero ~ rep( digit ) ^^ {case x ~ y => mkS( x ::y ) } ) def string = ' \ " ' ~> rep( charSeq | chrExcept ( '\ " ' , '
' , EofCh ) ) <~ '\ " ' ^^ {case x => mkS( x ) } def checkKeyword ( xs : List [ Any ] ) = { val strRep = mkS( xs ) if ( reserved contains strRep ) { Keyword( strRep ) } else if ( identiferRe.findFirstIn(strRep ) != None ) { Identifier ( strRep ) } else { ErrorToken ( " Not a Identifier : " + strRep ) } } override def whitespace : Parser [ Any ] = rep ( whitespaceChar | '!' ~ rep ( chrExcept ( EofCh , '
' ) ) ) def nonzero = elem ( " nonzero digit " , d => d.isDigit && d != ' 0 ' ) def zero : Parser [ String ] = ' 0 ' ^^^ " 0 " def charSeq : Parser [ String ] = ( ' \\ ' ~ '\ " ' ^^^ " \ " " |'\\ ' ~ ' \\ ' ^^^ " \\ " |'\ \ ' ~ '/' ^^^ " / " |'\\ ' ~ ' b ' ^^^ " \b " | ' \ \ ' ~ ' 0 ' ^^^ " " |'\\ ' ~ ' f ' ^^^ " \f " |'\\ ' ~ ' n ' ^^^ "
" |'\\ ' ~ 'r ' ^^^ " \r " |'\\ ' ~ ' t ' ^^^ " \t " ) def identiferRe = " " " ^ ( \w| [ ^ " ] ) + $ " " " .r def chrAny = chrExcept ( EofCh , ' ' , '
' , '\t ' , ' \r ' , '\ " ' , '!') def mkS [ A ] ( seq : Seq [ A ] ) = seq mkString " " }
Scalaで処理系を作る場合はとりあえず StdLexical を継承して拡張すれば、だいたいOK。ここでは
Token を返すレクサを定義する。 Keyword や StringLit といった Token を継承したケースクラス は scala.util.parsing.sytax.StdTokens で定義されていて、 StdLexical は StdTokens を Mix-inしている。
抽象構文木をつく る
次に、このトークンの並びから文法を定義して、それに従って抽象構文木を作るわけだけど、スタック指向言語の場合、ここで難しいことはあまりない。
とりあえず、処理( といっても4種類、しかもうち2種類は意味なし）と、抽象構文木をあらわすケースクラスを作る。インタプリタなのでオペコードとかする意味はないけど、こうしとくとVMにしようと思ったとき楽なのでそうした。というよりエミュとかを作ることが好きなので、こういう数値を見ると安心するのである。
import scala.util.logging.ConsoleLogger import scala.collection.mutable .
{Stack , ArrayBuffer , HashMap} trait Opecode { final val OP_NOP : byte = 0x00 final val OP_PUSH : byte = 0x01 final val OP_CALL : byte = 0x50 final val OP_RTN : byte = 0x51 } abstract class Node { type Value val v: Value def value = v } abstract class NodeValue extends Node case class NodeStr ( v: String ) extends NodeValue { type Value = String } case class NodeInt ( v:int ) extends NodeValue { type Value = int } case class NodeBool ( v:boolean ) extends NodeValue { type Value = boolean } case class NodeSymbol ( override val v:String ) extends NodeStr( v ) case class NodeQuotation ( val v: List [ Node ] ) extends Node{ type Value = List [ Node ] } case class NodeOpe ( v : byte , operand : List [ Node ] ) extends Node { type Value = byte } case class NodeNamed ( v: Named ) extends NodeValue with Opecode{ type Value = Named } case class NodeProgram ( v: List [ Node ] ) extends Node with Opecode{ type Value = List [ Node ] var quotIndex = 0 def nextQuotSym = { quotIndex += 1 ; " quot " + quotIndex } def toplevel = { val nullsf = List [ NodeSymbol ] ( ) val words = new ArrayBuffer [ Node ] def visitNode ( n : Node ) : List [ Node ] = n match { case NodeNamed ( NamedWord ( name , sin , sout , body ) ) => words += NodeNamed ( NamedWord( name , sin , sout , body.flatMap(visitNode ) ) ) List [ Node ] ( ) case NodeQuotation ( nodes ) => val name = nextQuotSym words += NodeNamed ( NamedWord ( name , nullsf , nullsf , nodes.flatMap(visitNode ) ) ) List ( NodeOpe( OP_PUSH , List ( NodeSymbol ( name ) ) ) ) case x => List( x ) } value.flatMap(visitNode ) words .toList } } abstract class Named ( name : String ) case class NamedWord ( name : String , stackin : List[ NodeSymbol ] , stackout : List[ NodeSymbol ] , body : List [ Node ] ) extends Named ( name ) case class NamedNativeWord [ T ] ( name : String , stackin : List[ NodeSymbol ] , stackout : List [ NodeSymbol ] , body : ( ) => T ) extends Named ( name ) class NamedTable extends HashMap [ String , Named ] { }
Node という抽象クラスを継承して、いろんなノードを定義する。だいたい名前をみてのとおりだけど、わかりにくいところだとこんな感じ。
NodeNamed：名前付けされた値への参照
NodeSymbol：word名
NodeQuotation：無名関数( quotationという )
NodeProgram：プログラム全体
Named は名前付けされた値なわけだけど、今回変数にあたるものはないので、wordのみがコレにあたる。
NamedWord が SimpleFactorで書かれたふつーのword、 NamedNativeWord はいわゆる組み込みwordでScalaで書いたものをあらわす。 NamedTable はその対応を保存する単なるハッシュマップ。
さて、ではこいつらを使って構文木を作って実行する。

push ( a ) def pop = stack .pop }
はじめの方でプログラムの文法を定義し、
Token から Node のリストへ変換し、 NodeProgram にする。処理の簡単さのため、プログラムはwordから構成されていて、プログラム開始時にはmain wordから実行が開始されるとするので
def program = rep( lWord ) ^^ { case nodes => NodeProgram ( nodes ) }
word は
: add ( x y -- z ) + ;
という感じに定義するので lWord の定義になっている。ほとんどそのまま書いた感じだ。 ( x y -- z )
の部分はスタックエフェクトといって、このwordがスタックにどのような影響を与えるのかを記述している。あくまで説明であって本質的な意味はない。 ( x y -- z )
ならスタックから2個取り出されて、結果が1個詰まれるのだな、ということがわかる。
あとは自明なので省略。
実行
そんなこんなでソースコードから NodeProgram が作れるようになった。次に NodeProgram からTOP レベル環境を作る。
ここでは、 NodeProgram に含まれるquotation を( 実行する際の）簡単さのためNamedWordに変換し、変換後のNamedWordの呼び出しに変換する。組み込みwordもここで定義している。これはこの部分で定義すると、クロージャになるため定義が簡単だから( pop や push といった SimpleFactorInterp のメソッドがそのまま書ける ) である。また、パターンマッチを活用することで非常に直感的に書けていることが見て取れるかと。やっぱりパターンマッチ最高だわぁ･･･。そして出揃ったTOPレベルのwordを
NamedTable にマッピングし 、TOP レベル環境の作成が完了する。
あとは main wordを呼び出すだけ 。
サンプルコー ド
こんな感じ。サンプルでは10の階乗を計算している。
object SimpleFactor extends ConsoleLogger{ def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) = { log ( " Starting SimpleFactor . " ) log ( " - " * 40 ) val ip = new SimpleFactorInterp ip.evaluate ( " " " !
Performs a factorial calculation . : main ( str -- ) string > number fact . ; : fact ( x -- y ) dup factit ; : factit ( x y -- z ) dup 1 <= [ drop ] [ 1 - dup rotate * swap factit ] if ; " " " , args ) } } SimpleFactor.main ( Array ( " 10 " ) )
ここで使っているwordを簡単に説明すると
`string>number`:スタックからpopし、文字列を数値に変換してpushする
`*` : スタックから2個popし、掛けたものをpushする
` -` : スタックから2個popし、引き算したものをpushする
` < =` : スタックか ら2 個popし、 <= な比較をして真偽値をpushする
な比較をして真偽値をpushする `.` : スタックからpopし、文字列表現を表示する
`dup`:スタックからpopし、それを2回pushする
`drop` : スタックからpopする
`rotate` : 「x y z」というスタックのトップ部分を、「y z x」にローテーションす る
`swap` : 「x y」というスタックのトップ部分を「y x」に入れ替え る
`if` : 「 真偽値 真のとき実行するquotation 偽のとき実行するquotation 」 というスタックのトップ部分から条件を判定しquotationを実行する
てな感じ。これだけの命令でもちゃんとプログラムが書けて、条件分岐、ループが実現できるのはスタック指向言語を知らない人から見ると面白い部分かも。 3 fact なら
[ 3 3 ] : fact内 dup
[ 3 3 3 ] : factit内 dup
[ 3 3 3 1 ] : 1
[ 3 3 f ] : <=
[ 3 3 f quot ] : [ drop ]
[ 3 3 f quot quot ] : [ 1 - ... ]
[ 3 3 ] : if
[ 3 3 1 ] : 1
[ 3 2 ] : -
[ 3 2 2 ] : dup
[ 2 2 3 ] : rotate
[ 2 6 ] : *
[ 6 2 ] : swap
factitに戻る
こんな感じで計算される。
またLispのS式とマクロによる拡張性は名高いと思うが、スタック指向言語も単純に空白で区切られたwordが並んでいる、という点で非常に自己拡張性が高い。こういう変態的(? ) な部分も魅力の一つ。
Forth はSUN のOpen Firmware 、Firefox4で採用が予定されているJavascriptの処理系Tamarinの中など、今でもあまり表には見えてこない部分で使用されているので、これを機会にスタック指向言語を嗜んでみては。Forthは基本だけど、今なら注目され始めている(？)
Factorかなあ。

Barack Obama 's quest for the White House is being keenly followed in Kenya , where his grandmother lives .
Adam Mynott reports from Nairobi .
Thursday was the 21st anniversary of the United Nations Convention Against Torture .
It was also the same day that two Bush administration lawyers appeared before a House subcommittee to answer questions about their roles in providing the legal framework for harsh interrogation techniques that inevitably rose to the level of torture and shamed the U.S. before the rest of the world .
The lawyers , both former Justice Department officials , were David Addington , who is now Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff , and John Yoo , now a law professor at the University of California , Berkeley .
There is no danger of either being enshrined as heroes in the history books of the future .
For most Americans , torture is something remote , abstract , reprehensible , but in the eyes of some , perhaps necessary  when the bomb is ticking , for example , or when interrogators are trying to get information from terrorists willing to kill Americans in huge numbers .
Reality offers something much different .
We saw the hideous photos from Abu Ghraib .
And now the Nobel Prize - winning organization Physicians for Human Rights has released a report , called “ Broken Laws , Broken Lives , ” that puts an appropriately horrifying face on a practice that is so fundamentally evil that it cannot co-exist with the idea of a just and humane society .
Hurricane Katrina played a major part in Julie Martin ‘s move from specializing in restoring historic homes to building a portable , affordable , well built vision on wheels called the “ Fresh Start . ”
Julie lost everything in Katrina , but gained a vision on building small homes from the experience .
With the initial guidance of Jay Shafer of Tumbleweed Tiny Houses , Julie has started a new company called Martin House - To - Go
with the goal of making an affordable tiny house that can be easily moved from place to place on a trailer .
Or if you prefer to leave your house in one place it can be removed from the trailer and put on a foundation .
With 2008 comes a new model called the Fresh Start .
With an introductory price of $ 29,900 , all you need to get one of your own is a 3 / 4 ton truck with a 2 5/16th trailer hitch ball and a spirit of adventure .
These tiny homes can be used as a primary residence , for vacation and travel , a vacation home , a mother - in - law house or a private guest cottage or spare room .
With a full bath , kitchen and loft and quality throughout , I would put this tiny house high on my list .

At a time when the world 's top climate experts agree that carbon emissions must be rapidly reduced to hold down global warming , Italy 's major electricity producer , Enel , is converting its huge power plant here from oil to coal , generally the dirtiest fuel on Earth .
Over the next five years , Italy will increase its reliance on coal from 14 to 33 percent .
Power generated by Enel from coal will rise to 50 percent .
Capture and storage vital
And Italy is not alone in its return to coal .
Driven by rising demand , record high oil and natural gas prices , concerns over energy security and an aversion to nuclear energy , European countries are scheduled to build about 50 coal - fired plants over the next five years , plants that will be in use for the next five decades .
In the United States , fewer new coal plants are scheduled to go online , in part because it is becoming harder to get regulatory permits and in part because nuclear power remains an alternative .
Of 151 proposals in early 2007 , more than 60 had been dropped , many blocked by state governments .
Dozens of others are stuck in court challenges .
The fast - expanding developing economies of India and China , where coal remains a major fuel source for more than 2 billion people , have long been regarded as among the biggest challenges to reducing carbon emissions .
But the return now to coal even in eco-conscious Europe is sowing real alarm among environmentalists who warn that it is setting the world on a disastrous trajectory .
Environmentalists aghast
They are aghast at the renaissance of coal , a fuel more commonly associated with the sooty factories of Charles Dickens ' novels , and one that was on its way out just a decade ago .
There have been protests here in Civitavecchia , at a new coal plant in Germany and at one in the Czech Republic , as well as at the Kingsnorth power station in Kent , which is scheduled to become Britain 's first new coal - fired plant in more than a decade .
Europe 's power station owners emphasize that they are making the new coal plants as clean as possible .
But critics say that " clean coal " is a pipe dream , an oxymoron in terms of the carbon emissions that count most toward climate change .
" Building new coal - fired power plants is ill conceived , " said James E. Hansen , a leading climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
" Given our knowledge about what needs to be done to stabilize climate , this plan is like barging into a war without having a plan for how it should be conducted , even though information is available . "
Enel , like many electricity companies , says it has little choice but to build coal plants to replace aging infrastructure , particularly in countries like Italy and Germany that have banned the building of nuclear power plants .
Fuel costs have risen 151 percent since 1996 , and Italians pay the highest electricity costs in Europe .
In terms of cost and energy security , coal has all the advantages , its proponents argue .
Coal reserves will last for 200 years , rather than 50 years for gas and oil .
Coal is relatively cheap compared with oil and natural gas , although coal prices have tripled in the past few years .
More important , hundreds of countries export coal - there is not a coal cartel - so there is more room to negotiate prices .
" In order to get over oil , which is getting more and more expensive , our plan is to convert all oil plants to coal using clean - coal technologies , " said Gianfilippo Mancini , Enel 's chief of generation and energy management .
" This will be the cleanest coal plant in Europe .
We are hoping to prove that it will be possible to make sustainable and environmentally friendly use of coal . "
" Clean coal " is a term coined by the industry decades ago , referring to its efforts to reduce local pollution .
Using new technology , clean coal plants sharply reduced the number of sooty particles spewed into the air , as well as gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide .
The technology has no effect on carbon .
In fact , the technology that the industry is counting on to reduce the carbon - dioxide emissions that add to global warning - carbon capture and storage - is not now commercially available .
No one knows if it is feasible on a large , cost - effective scale .
Green challenge
The task - in which carbon emissions are pumped into underground reservoirs rather than released - is challenging for any fuel source , but particularly so for coal , which produces more carbon dioxide than oil or natural gas .
Under optimal current conditions , coal produces more than twice as much carbon dioxide per unit of electricity as natural gas , the second - most - common fuel used for electricity generation , according to the Electric Power Research Institute .
In the developing world , where even new coal plants use lower grade coal and less efficient machinery , the equation is even worse .
Without carbon capture and storage , coal can not be green .
But solving that problem will take global coordination and billions of dollars in investment , which no one country or company seems inclined to spend , said Jeffrey D. Sachs , director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University .
There are a few dozen small demonstration projects in Europe and in the United States , most in the early stages .
But progress has not been promising .
Many have likened carbon capture 's road from the demonstration lab to a safe , cheap , available reality as a challenge equivalent to putting a man on the moon .
It may be even harder than that .
It 's like a moon landing that must be replicated daily at thousands of coal plants in hundreds of countries - many of them poor .
There is a new coal - fire plant going up in India and China every week , and most of those are not constructed in a way that it amenable to carbon capture , even if it were developed .
Plants that could someday be adapted to carbon capture cost 10 to 20 percent more to build , and only a handful exist today .
For most coal power plants the costs of converting would be " phenomenal , " concluded a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Then there is the problem of storing the carbon , which is at some level an inherently local issue .
Geologists have to determine if there is a suitable underground site , calculate how much carbon it can hold and then equip it in a way that prevent leaks and ensures safety .
A large leak of underground carbon could be as dangerous as a leak of nuclear fuel , critics say .

Jones told the Arctic Beacon Saturday in a telephone conversation from Provo , Utah , he first presented his explosive conclusions at Brigham Young University ( BYU ) on September 22 , to 60 people from the BYU and Utah Valley State College faculties , including professors of Engineering , Electrical Engineering , Geology , Mathematics and Psychology .
After presently scientific arguments in favor of the controlled demolition theory , Jones said everyone in attendance from all backgrounds , conservative and liberal , were in total agreement further investigation was needed .
“ I was quite surprised how my conclusions were received , ” said Jones , adding he plans to give two continue telling the public how he came to his startling conclusions essentially ripping apart the official government story that jet fuel brought down the towers , including Building 7 .
“ In fact , after I researched how Building 7 fell , I am certain there existed pre-positioned explosives to bring down the three buildings . ”
Jones added that the contingent of faculty members at the September seminar were all in agreement that the government needed to “ come clean ” and release more that 6,900 photographs and close to 7,000 segments of video footage , now being held from independent investigation by the FBI and other agencies .
Since day one , the Bush administration has safely guarded much of the 9/11evidence , including the WTC steel hauled away by FEMA and eye - witness testimony of basement explosions censored by the 9/11 Commission and the state sponsored press , as well as discrediting many other scientists or academics like Jones who have disagreed with the official story .
“ We are calling for the release of all the data , including the videos and photos , in order that a cross- disciplinary , preferably international team of scientists and engineers can reach an independent conclusion , ” said Jones , adding all 60 professors in attendance agreed with this course of action .
“ Since I decided to come forward with my findings , I have found the people in the 9/11 community very supportive and helpful .
I hope my contribution will one day help get at the truth of what really happened and specifically how the towers collapsed . ”
Jones ’ theory on the way the towers collapsed was presented in a 9,000 word formal paper already approved for publication in an upcoming academic journal .
The following is a partial explanation of how and why he came to his conclusions that the WTC most likely collapsed due to pre-positioned explosives .
He writes : “ In writing this paper , I call for a serious investigation of the hypothesis that WTC 7 and the Twin Towers were brought down , not just by damage and fires , but through the use of pre-positioned explosives .
“ I consider the official FEMA , NIST , and 9 - 11 Commission reports that fires plus damage alone caused complete collapses of all three buildings .
And I present evidence for the explosive - demolition hypothesis , which is suggested by the available data , testable and falsifiable , and yet has not been analyzed in any of the reports funded by the US government .
And the reasoning behind his conclusions can be summed up as follows : •
The three buildings collapsed nearly symmetrically , falling down into their footprints , a phenomenon associated with " controlled demolition " — and even then it 's very difficult , he says .
" Why would terrorists undertake straight - down collapses of WTC - 7 and the Towers when ' toppling over ' falls would require much less work and would do much more damage in downtown Manhattan ? "
Jones asks .
" And where would they obtain the necessary skills and access to the buildings for a symmetrical implosion anyway ?
The ' symmetry data ' emphasized here , along with other data , provide strong evidence for an ' inside ' job . " •
No steel - frame building , before or after the WTC buildings , has ever collapsed due to fire .
But explosives can effectively sever steel columns , he says .
• WTC 7 , which was not hit by hijacked planes , collapsed in 6.6 seconds , just .6 of a second longer than it would take an object dropped from the roof to hit the ground .
" Where is the delay that must be expected due to conservation of momentum , one of the foundational laws of physics ? " he asks .
" That is , as upper - falling floors strike lower floors — and intact steel support columns — the fall must be significantly impeded by the impacted mass .
. . .
How do the upper floors fall so quickly , then , and still conserve momentum in the collapsing buildings ? "
The paradox , he says , " is easily resolved by the explosive demolition hypothesis , whereby explosives quickly removed lower - floor material , including steel support columns , and allow near free - fall - speed collapses . "
These observations were not analyzed by FEMA , NIST nor the 9/11 Commission , he says .
•
With non-explosive - caused collapse there would typically be a piling up of shattering concrete .
But most of the material in the towers was converted to flour - like powder while the buildings were falling , he says .
" How can we understand this strange behavior , without explosives ?
Remarkable , amazing — and demanding scrutiny since the U.S. government - funded reports failed to analyze this phenomenon . "
• Horizontal puffs of smoke , known as squibs , were observed proceeding up the side the building , a phenomenon common when pre-positioned explosives are used to demolish buildings , he says .
•
Steel supports were " partly evaporated , " but it would require temperatures near 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit to evaporate steel — and neither office materials nor diesel fuel can generate temperatures that hot .
Fires caused by jet fuel from the hijacked planes lasted at most a few minutes , and office material fires would burn out within about 20 minutes in any given location , he says .
• Molten metal found in the debris of the World Trade Center may have been the result of a high - temperature reaction of a commonly used explosive such as thermite , he says .
Buildings not felled by explosives " have insufficient directed energy to result in melting of large quantities of metal , " Jones says .
•
Multiple loud explosions in rapid sequence were reported by numerous observers in and near the towers , and these explosions occurred far below the region where the planes struck , he says .
Jones will also be appearing on Greg Szymanski ’s radio show called “ The Investigative Journal ” on the Republic Broadcasting Network at www.rbnlive.com on Monday at 12 noon central time .

After its closest approach to Earth , Rosetta looked back and took a number of images using the OSIRIS Narrow Angle Camera ( NAC ) .
This particular image was acquired 15 November 2007 at 03:30 CET .

AUSTIN , Texas —
If Earth had been slightly smaller and less massive , life might never have gained a foothold .
They key to life on Earth as we know it , scientists figure , is plate tectonics — the forces that move continents and build mountains .
And the more massive a world is , the thinner its plates are .
Thinner plates are weaker and more easily moved and so able to support the kinds of crucial planet - shaping plate tectonics experienced on this planet over the billions of years that life evolved from simple one - celled organisms to complex creatures that can fly , swim and read .
" Plate tectonics are essential to life as we know it , " said Diana Valencia of Harvard University , who presented research on the topic here Wednesday at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
" Our calculations show that bigger is better when it comes to the habitability of rocky planets . "
The study reveals Earth has been on the edge of habitability from the beginning , and just eked by to allow life - friendly conditions .
The results give hope to astronomers looking for life on other planets .
" It expands the potential to find life on other planets that are different from Earth , " said astrophysicist Sara Seager of MIT , who was not involved in the study .
She added that Valencia " has shown us that we can have hope that we can have life there . "
Not too hot , not too cold
Plate tectonics , Valencia explains , is what allows the carbon cycle on Earth to operate .
So as plates spread apart from each other , slide under one another , and even crash into each other to lift gigantic mountain ranges like the Himalayas , they also recycle carbon dioxide .
This greenhouse gas acts as a thermostat to keep Earth balmy — but not scorching — over geologic time scales .
" Recycling is important even on a planetary scale , " Valencia explained .
Valencia and her Harvard colleagues , Richard O'Connell and Dimitar Sasselov , examined so - called super - Earths more than twice the size of Earth and up to 10 times as massive .
Any heftier and the planet would have enough tug to collect gas , transforming it into a Neptune - or Jupiter - like world , theory holds .
They studied planets roughly the age of Earth , because really old planets would have cooled off too much to support convection and plate tectonics .
Bigger is better
The simulations showed that rocky orbs with masses three times that of Earth and greater should experience plate tectonics .
Earth was found to be a borderline case , which is supported by the fact that the slightly smaller planet Venus is tectonically inactive .
The reason for plate tectonics , Valencia said , might be water , because it weakens the plates through lubrication .
That can nudge plate tectonics .
Venus has no water .
" It might not be a coincidence that Earth is the largest rocky planet in our solar system , and also the only one with life , " Valencia said .
As a rocky world gets more massive , the plates get thinner and so they are easier to move .
That means super - Earths would be more geologically active than our planet .
" The bigger planets have more favorable conditions for plate tectonics than Earth does , " Valencia told LiveScience .
Vacation destinations ?
To date , five super - Earths have been spotted , even though they are very difficult to detect with current technology .
Each orbits close to its host star , however , and are too hot for life .
If super - Earths are as common as observations suggest , the researchers say it is inevitable that some will have Earth - like orbits within the habitable zones of their host star , making them comfy havens for life .
" There are not only more potentially habitable planets , but many more , " said Sasselov , who is director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative .
He speculates our descendants in the far - future might consider a super - Earth for their next vacation , assuming some means of exotic propulsion were devised for the trip .
While this vacation would be " out of this world , " Sasselov added the super - Earth destination would feel just like home .
That is in terms of its geography .
With more rapid plate tectonics , there would be less time for mountains and ocean trenches to form before getting recycled .
That means a landscape where mountains soar no taller than those on Earth , for instance .
" The landscape would be familiar , " Sasselov said .
" A super - Earth would feel very much like home . "
Minneapolis is n't exactly keen on the idea of keeping bars open later for the Republican National Convention , but city officials may be willing to deal .
Across the river in St. Paul , which is hosting the convention at the Xcel Energy Center , city officials had similar reactions to their Minneapolis counterparts .
They were responding Tuesday to the legislative proposal to allow cities within 10 miles of the convention to push the bar closing time from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. during the 11 days around the Sept. 1 - 4 convention .
" The St. Paul Police Department has concerns about the additional costs of public safety , estimated at nearly $ 500,000 , by extending the bar hours until 4 a.m. during the convention , " said Assistant Chief Matt Bostrom , who 's heading up convention security .
Minneapolis Council Member Paul Ostrow was ready to nix the whole idea .
A prime factor is that police already will be working 12 - hour shifts during the convention .
But the Minneapolis council 's intergovernmental panel on Tuesday heeded the plea of Mayor R.T. Rybak not to make a decision yet .
The proposal comes from Rep. Phyllis Kahn , DFL - Minneapolis .
Later bar hours would be just fine with Council Member Ralph Remington .
" People do n't say , ' I 'm coming to Minneapolis to have fun , ' " he opined .
Longer bar hours would help , he said .
But colleague Diane Hofstede said she 'd rather the city 's fun quotient be judged on cultural and family activities .
Council members agreed they do n't want neighborhood bars staying open until 4 a.m .
There was doubt about whether the city could do more than vote yes or no on the longer hours , which also includes temporary Sunday liquor store hours .
So council members instructed city lobbyists to ask for the power to designate where the longer hours would be allowed and for how many days .
St. Paul Council Member Pat Harris said that he 's open to exploring the idea but that the two cities need to work together .
" I'm opposed , " said St. Paul Council Member Lee Helgen , who intends to bring a resolution to the City Council today that says as much .
Later bar hours were never an expectation in the deal , he said , and he does n't think an exception needs to be made .
" I 've got a ton of questions , " said Council President Kathy Lantry .
She said she would n't support a citywide extension but might be able to get behind something that gives the city controls .

This is the kind of thing we forget .
This is the kind of thing that , given all our distractions , our celeb obsessions and happy drugs and bothersome trifles like family and bills and war and health care and sex and love and porn and breathing and death , tends to fly under the radar of your overspanked consciousness , only to be later rediscovered and brought forth and placed directly in front of your eyeballs , at least for a moment , so you can look , really look , and go , oh my God , I had no idea .
The Earth is humming .
Singing .
Churning out a tune without the aid of battery or string or wind - up mechanism and its song is ethereal and mystifying and very , very weird , a rather astonishing , newly discovered phenomena that 's not easily analyzed , but which , if you really let it sink into your consciousness , can change the way you look at everything .
Indeed , scientists now say the planet itself is generating a constant , deep thrum of noise .
No mere cacophony , but actually a kind of music , huge , swirling loops of sound , a song so strange you can't really fathom it , so low it can't be heard by human ears , chthonic roars churning from the very water and wind and rock themselves , countless notes of varying vibration creating all sorts of curious tonal phrases that bounce around the mountains and spin over the oceans and penetrate the tectonic plates and gurgle in the magma and careen off the clouds and smack into trees and bounce off your ribcage and spin over the surface of the planet in strange circular loops , " like dozens of lazy hurricanes , " as one writer put it .
It all makes for a very quiet , otherworldly symphony so odd and mysterious , scientists still can't figure out exactly what 's causing it or why the hell it 's happening .
Sure , sensitive instruments are getting better at picking up what 's been dubbed " Earth 's hum , " but no one 's any closer to understanding what the hell it all might mean .
Which , of course , is exactly as it should be .
Because then , well , then you get to crank up your imagination , your mystical intuition , your poetic sensibility - and if there 's one thing we 're lacking in modern America , it 's ... well , you know .
Me , I like to think of the Earth as essentially a giant Tibetan singing bowl , flicked by the middle finger of God and set to a mesmerizing , low ring for about 10 billion years until the tone begins to fade and the vibration slows and eventually the sound completely disappears into nothingness and the birds are all , hey what the hell happened to the music ?
And God just shrugs and goes , well that was interesting .
Or maybe the planet is more like an enormous wine glass , half full of a heady potion made of horny unicorns and divine lubricant and perky sunshine , around the smooth , gleaming rim of which Dionysus himself circles his wet fingertip , generating a mellifluous tone that makes the wood nymphs dance and the satyrs orgasm and the gods hum along as they all watch 7 billion confused human ants scamper about with their lattes and their war and their perpetually adorable angst , oblivious .
But most of all , I believe the Earth actually ( and obviously ) resonates , quite literally , with the Hindu belief in the divine sound of OM ( or more accurately , AUM ) , that single , universal syllable that contains and encompasses all : birth and death , creation and destruction , being and nothingness , rock and roll , Christian and pagan , meat and vegetable , spit and swallow .
You know ?
But here 's the best part :
This massive wave of sound ?
The Earth 's deep , mysterious OM , it 's perpetual hum of song ?
Totally normal - that is , if by " normal " you mean " unfathomably powerful and speaking to a vast mystical timelessness we can't possibly comprehend . "
Indeed , all the spheres do it , all the planets and all the quasars and stars and moons and whirlpool galaxies , all vibrating and humming like a chorus of wayward deities singing sea shanties in a black hole .
It 's nothing new , really : Mystics and poets and theorists have pondered the " music of the spheres " ( or musica universalis ) for eons ; it is the stuff of cosmic philosophy , linking sacred geometry , mathematics , cosmology , harmonics , astrology and music into one big cosmological poetry slam .
Translation :
You do n't have to look very far to understand that human beings - hell , all animals , really - adore song and music and tone and rhythm , and then link this everyday source of life straight to the roar of the planet itself , and then back out to the cosmos .
In other words , you love loud punk ?
Metal ?
Jazz ?
Deep house ?
Saint - Saens with a glass of Pinot in the tub ?
Sure you do .
That 's because somewhere , somehow , deep in your very cells and bones and DNA , it links you back to source , to the Earth 's own vibration , the pulse of the cosmos .
Oh yes it does .
To tap your foot and sway your body to that weird new Portishead tune is , in effect , to sway it to the roar of the universe .
I mean , obviously .
At some point we 'll probably figure it all out .
Science will , with its typical charming , arrogant certainty , sift and measure and quantify this " mystical " Earthly hum , and tell us it merely comes from , say , ocean movements , or solar wind , or 10 billion trees all deciding to grow a quarter millimeter all at once .
We will do as we always do : oversimplify , peer through a single lens of understanding , stick this dazzling phenomenon in a narrow category , and forget it .
How dangerously boring .
I much prefer , in matters mystical and musical and deeply cosmic , to tell the logical mind to shut up and let the soul take over and say , wait wait wait , maybe most humans have this divine connection thing all wrong .
Maybe
God really is n't some scowling gay - hating deity raining down guilt and judgment and fear on all humankind after all .
Maybe she 's actually , you know , a throb , a pulse , a song , deep , complex , eternal .
And us , well , we 're just bouncing and swaying along as best we can , trying to figure out the goddamn melody .

American officials also acknowledged that there are serious health risks to detainees and American military personnel who work at the Bagram prison , because of their exposure to heavy metals from the aircraft - repair machinery and asbestos .
“ It ’s just not suitable , ” another Pentagon official said .
“ At some point , you have to say , ‘ That ’s it .
This place was not made to keep people there indefinitely . ’ ”
That point came about six months ago .
It became clear to Pentagon officials that the original plan of releasing some Afghan prisoners outright and transferring other detainees to Afghan custody would not come close to emptying the existing detention center .
Although a special Afghan court has been established to prosecute detainees formerly held at Bagram and Guantánamo , American officials have been hesitant to turn over those prisoners they consider most dangerous .
In late February the head of detainee operations in Iraq , Maj. Gen. Douglas M. Stone , traveled to Bagram to assess conditions there .
In Iraq , General Stone has encouraged prison officials to build ties to tribal leaders , families and communities , said a Congressional official who has been briefed on the general ’s work .
As a result , American officials are giving Iraqi detainees job training and engaging them in religious discussions to help prepare them to re-enter Iraqi society .
About 8,000 detainees have been released in Iraq since last September .
Fewer than 1 percent of them have been returned to the prison , said Lt. Cmdr. K. C. Marshall , General Stone ’s spokesman .
The new detention center at Bagram will incorporate some of the lessons learned by the United States in Iraq .
Classrooms will be built for vocational training and religious discussion , and there will be more space for recreation and family visits , officials said .
After years of entreaties by the International Committee of the Red Cross , the United States recently began to allow relatives to speak with prisoners at Bagram through video hookups .
Chris Matthews : MSNBC bosses were ' basically pro-war ' Diane Sweet

( CNN ) --
A high school valedictorian 's plans to study medicine at a California state university have run headlong into the federal government 's attempts to return him and his family to Armenia .
Arthur Mkoyan , 17 , was 2 years old when his family came to the United States .
" I have n't been in Armenia since I was 2 , so I do n't really know anything about the place , " said Arthur Mkoyan , 17 .
" All I 've seen is just videos my mom has watched on the Internet . "
Mkoyan 's long - term plans were turned upside down one morning in April when two immigration officers arrived at the door of his family 's house .
" They took both of my parents , and they released my mom because she had to take care of us , since me and my brother are minors , " he recalled .
" But instead they took my dad away to a detention center in Arizona . "
Mkoyan , who has a grade - point average above 4.0 -- extra credit for Advanced Placement classes makes that possible -- is set to graduate next week from Bullard High School in Fresno , California .
Watch students from Arthur 's school talk about his case »
Ten days later , Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to deport him and his family to the Armenian capital city of Yerevan , the same city his family fled in fear 16 years ago .
Back then , Mkoyan 's father , Ruben Mkoian ( he and his son spell their last names differently ) , was a sergeant in an Armenian equivalent of a department of motor vehicles , according to a court document .
" He was approached with a bribe to register stolen vehicles .
He refused .
A co-worker took the bribe .
Mkoian reported the incident to the chief of the DMV , who told him to mind his own business , " the document states .
" Subsequently , he and his family were subjected to attacks he believed were attempts to silence him about corruption at the DMV . "
In what the family considers one such attempt , their house was set on fire in 1992 .
That led the father to send his family to Russia and then to the United States , Arthur Mkoyan said .
They arrived in the United States in 1995 on six - month tourist visas , according to Virginia Kice , a public information officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
The family settled in Fresno , where Mkoian worked as a truck driver and his wife worked in a jewelry store .
They set about living their lives , which soon included a younger brother for Arthur .
But after the visas expired , the family 's application to remain in the United States was denied .
In 2002 , an immigration judge ruled that they had no legal basis to remain in the country , Kice said .
After their application to the Board of Immigration Appeals was rejected , the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year denied their petition for a hearing .
The court was unpersuaded by the father 's assertion that he might still be subject to reprisal if he were to return .
" Mkoian 's fear that Armenian officials would be unable or unwilling to protect him seems unfounded because he provided little evidence that they were unable or unwilling to protect him in the past , " the appeals court said .
To Kice , it 's a simple matter of enforcing the law .
" I would remind people that this family had ample access to due process , " she said .
" The case has been in litigation for more than 10 years .
Immigration experts on every level determined that they had no legal basis to be in the United States . "
She noted that the government agreed to delay their deportation so Arthur can graduate with his class .
Arthur 's schoolmates at Bullard are shocked that his academic achievements have n't helped his case .
" It 's really hard to get good grades in this school , " freshman Alex Stewart told affiliate KGPE .
" It 's a challenging school , so to get a 4.0 , you really gotta try . "
Still , a longer - term reprieve remains possible , if unlikely .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - California , may attempt to pass a " private bill " that would allow the family to remain in the United States .
" Our office is looking into the case , " said Scott Gerber , a spokesman for the senator .
But the odds against it are long .
There is " almost no chance " that the family 's quest for a private bill will succeed , said Daniel Kowalski , editor - in - chief of Bender 's Immigration Bulletin .
" Very few are being passed , " he said .
In fact , of the 21 private immigration bills introduced last year , none was enacted .
In 2006 , 117 were introduced , and none was enacted ; in 2005 , 98 were introduced , and four were enacted .
But the filing itself would buy the family time , since it suspends any efforts to deport the family until the bill 's fate is determined .
Arthur appeared undaunted .
He appealed to a reporter to publicize his e-mail address ( artmkoyan@gmail.com ) so he can forward any letters of support to Feinstein .
Meanwhile , the academic skills he has displayed in Fresno may not easily translate to college in Armenia .
Arthur said he understands only a few words of Armenian .

The WWF said there were an estimated 3,500 tigers left
Tigers in the wild
The WWF told a conference in Stockholm there might be only 3,500 tigers left , and that one sub- species , the South China Tiger , could soon be extinct .
Chinese demand for tiger body parts - used in traditional medicine - was described as one of the main threats .
But the WWF said if proper measures were taken , tiger numbers could rise .
Conservationists have recently bought up land concessions from governments in an effort to combat the destruction of forests still inhabited by tigers .
' Human - tiger conflict '
The WWF 's co-ordinator in Nepal , Bivash Pandav , painted a bleak picture as he described the problems facing tigers across the world , saying he believed there were some 3,500 tigers left , compared with an estimated 5,000 - 7,000 in 1982 .
In many ways the tiger stands at a crossroads between extinction and survival , and which path it takes is totally dependent on us
Sujoy Banerjee
WWF India
The director of WWF India 's species programme , Sujoy Banerjee , said that at the beginning of the 20th Century there were an estimated 40,000 tigers in India , but that there were now no more than 1,400 - 60 % fewer than in 2002 .
Mr Banerjee said a serious threat to the remaining tigers came from poor Indian farmers who are determined to protect the livestock that they depend on .
" Whenever there is human - tiger conflict , the ultimate loser is the tiger , " he said .
The situation in Indonesia was described as critical , with loggers having laid waste to vast tracts of the habitat of the Sumatran Tiger - the next most threatened sub -species .
Based on current trends , more than 90 % of the country 's forests may have been destroyed by 2050 , the group said .
" In many ways the tiger stands at a crossroads between extinction and survival , and which path it takes is totally dependent on us , " Mr Banerjee warned .

It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Democrats ’ nomination of Obama as their candidate for president has done more to improve America ’s image abroad  an image dented by the Iraq war , President Bush ’s invocation of a post - 9/11 “ crusade , ” Abu Ghraib , Guantánamo Bay and the xenophobic opposition to Dubai Ports World managing U.S. harbors  than the entire Bush public diplomacy effort for seven years .

Of course , Egyptians still have their grievances with America , and will in the future no matter who is president  and we ’ve got a few grievances with them , too .
But every once in a while , America does something so radical , so out of the ordinary  something that old , encrusted , traditional societies like those in the Middle East could simply never imagine  that it revives America ’s revolutionary “ brand ” overseas in a way that no diplomat could have designed or planned .
I just had dinner at a Nile - side restaurant with two Egyptian officials and a businessman , and one of them quoted one of his children as asking : “ Could something like this ever happen in Egypt ? ”
And the answer from everyone at the table was , of course , “ no . ”
It could n’t happen anywhere in this region .
Could a Copt become president of Egypt ?
Not a chance .
Could a Shiite become the leader of Saudi Arabia ?
Not in a hundred years .
A Bahai president of Iran ?
In your dreams .
Here , the past always buries the future , not the other way around .
These Egyptian officials were particularly excited about Obama ’s nomination because it might mean that being labeled a “ pro-American ” reformer is no longer an insult here , as it has been in recent years .
As one U.S. diplomat put it to me : Obama ’s demeanor suggests to foreigners that he would not only listen to what they have to say but might even take it into account .
They anticipate that a U.S. president who spent part of his life looking at America from the outside in  as John McCain did while a P.O.W. in Vietnam  will be much more attuned to global trends .

This press release has been viewed 2124 time (s ) .
Sami Al - Arian was supposed to have been released from prison April 11 after more than five years behind bars .
Instead , the former University of South Florida professor is facing another extension of his incarceration–and has been forced to take desperate action in protest .
In March , Al - Arian began a new hunger strike , his third since he was first imprisoned in February 2003 .
As Socialist Worker went to press , he was on day 50 with no food and had reportedly lost more than 34 pounds .
According to his daughter , journalist Laila Al - Arian , the latest hunger strike is “ in protest against what the Department of Justice is doing to him .
His scheduled release date is April 11 , but they ’re trying to ensnare him in a whole other trial , just to increase his prison time , even though he ’s already spent five years in detention .
They ’re trying to keep him locked up indefinitely . ”
The government ’s 17 original charges against Al - Arian accused him of using a think tank and a Muslim school and charity as a cover for raising funds to finance “ terrorism . ”
In 2006 , after a lengthy trial , a Florida jury acquitted Al - Arian of the eight most serious charges and deadlocked on the rest , with the jury favoring acquittal by a 10 - 2 margin .
But the government kept Al - Arian in prison , threatening him with a retrial .
Rather than face this , Al - Arian agreed to plead guilty to a single count of the least serious charge against him , in exchange for a minor additional sentence and voluntary deportation .
“ The first trial cost us $ 1 million in legal fees , ” said Laila Al - Arian .
“ It was very , very exhausting : financially , physically , emotionally .
We just really did n’t want to go through that nightmare again .
Also , we would have had to hire new lawyers , because our lawyers were already committed to other cases . ”
But rather than release Al - Arian as promised after he served his sentence , Gordon Kromberg , the assistant U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia , had Al - Arian transferred to try to compel his testimony in an investigation into a Muslim charity in that state–in defiance of an agreement with Florida prosecutors , recorded in court transcripts , that he would be exempt from future testimony .
Kromberg has reportedly made anti-Muslim statements in the past .
According to Al - Arian attorney Jack Fernandez , when Fernandez requested that Al - Arian ’s 2006 transfer to Virginian be delayed until after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan , Kromberg responded that if Muslims “ can kill each other during Ramadan , they can appear before the grand jury .
All they ca n’t do is eat before sunset . ”
The courts have so far sided with Kromberg that Al - Arian should testify .
Al - Arian , however , views such testimony as a trap–since others who testified in similar cases were immediately charged with perjury .
Instead , by refusing to cooperate , Al - Arian has been held in contempt .
He now faces a new indictment on criminal contempt charges , which could lead to an open - ended jail sentence .
“ We really thought that once he signed that plea agreement , everything would be over , ” said Laila Al - Arian .
“ But , we realized later that you ca n’t trust the Department of Justice to keep its promise , because in our case , the plea agreement turned out to be a farce , a total lie .
If the prosecutors are not going to keep their word , then why would any defendant in history ever choose to sign a plea agreement ?…
“ It ’s almost like you ’re offered two poisons , and you have to choose one :
The first is that if he testifies in front of the grand jury they ’re trying to bring him in front of , in an unrelated case , they ’re going to charge him with perjury ; and , if he chooses not to testify , then he ’ll be charged with criminal contempt .
So either way , he ’ll be imprisoned more . ”
Beyond imprisonment alone , Al - Arian has endured at various times during his confinement virtual round - the - clock lockdown , unsanitary cell conditions , severe restrictions on his access to telephones and writing materials , and physical and verbal abuse at the hands of guards .
According to the Tampa Bay Coalition for Justice and Peace , a support group working for his release , Al - Arian , now under the jurisdiction of immigration authorities , was recently moved to the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in Portsmouth , Va .
“ Since arriving at the facility , he has been subjected to numerous , shocking abuses , even worse than those he experienced at a detention center in Maryland , ” read an alert issued by the group .
“ After placing him on suicide watch , prison guards confiscated all of Dr. Al - Arian ’s belongings .
“ His clothing , including undergarments , were taken away , and he was given only a thin hospital gown to wear in the cold prison .
Although Dr. Al - Arian suffers from weak eyesight , his eyeglasses were also taken away .
His cell contains no bed sheets , blankets or pillows , only a hard metal bed frame beneath a one - inch mattress .
“ Furthermore , guards took his drinking cup needed to drink water , which is critical during his hunger strike .
Further , Dr. Al - Arian was also told that he would only be given one telephone call every 15 days , and that he would not be allowed any attorney calls .
Even if he were to be given regular calls , a single call from Hampton Roads Regional Jail costs $ 25 …
“ Prior to his transfer , Dr. Al - Arian was promised by immigration officials that he would not be subjected to more humiliating and abusive treatment at the new facility .
These horrendous conditions reflect a gross negligence on the part of the authorities at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail and a deliberate attempt to break Dr. Al - Arian ’s will through this cruel and punitive treatment .
By subjecting him to these continuous abuses , they have attacked his basic dignity and jeopardized his health to an alarming degree . ”
As Laila Al - Arian pointed out , “ He ’s getting much weaker each day …
His spirits are always strong , which keeps us strong , but he really has had it with these tactics by the Department of Justice .
Five years of his life were already stolen from him and his family .
Enough is enough .
“ I think he really feels like going on this hunger strike is the only thing in his power to do to protest this grave injustice .
He ’s just taking it day by day .
I think he ’s very determined to continue on with the hunger strike , just as other political prisoners all over the world have done . ”
In the initial days of this hunger strike , Al - Arian had also been refusing water .
But prison officials have been slow to offer medical treatment .
“ Frankly , we ’re wondering why they have this approach , ” his daughter said .
“ Last year , he went 60 days without eating , taking only water for two months .
The human body can only handle so much .
They never force - fed him .
They never offered him any kind of proper treatment .
It ’s very scary for us as his family . ”
Now According to Laila , the Al - Arian family is trying to support Sami while renewing calls for his release .
“ We ’re fed up with this , ” she said .
“ It really feels like Groundhog Day –the same statements that were being released last year during the hunger strike are being released this year .
There ’s still a media blackout on his case …
“ Very few media outlets are really giving it the attention it really deserves , with the exception of your paper , Democracy Now ! and a few other small outlets here and there .
I think it ’s a determined decision to not cover this case , so that ’s frustrating for us . ”
Despite the abuse he ’s been subjected to , Sami Al - Arian has vowed not to give up .
In a statement recorded on March 31 from prison , he said , “ My case , dear sisters and brothers , represents a principled stand for all the sacred rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights .
It ’s in defense of the integrity of our system of justice .
“ After spending more than five years in 10 different prisons across the United States , and despite a six - month trial with 80 witnesses , including 21 from Israel , 12 average Americans stood firm and refused to convict innocent people of any count of over 100 charges leveled at them by the most powerful government in history .
“ No wonder people have been asking , ‘ Where is justice ? ’
Justice ca n’t be served when people are targeted because of their beliefs and politics … Justice ca n’t be served when those who are supposed to administer it abuse it in order to exact revenge .
Justice ca n’t be served when employing fear mongering and fear tactics by exploiting a national tragedy to silence the voices of a vulnerable and weak minority in our society . ”
For Laila Al - Arian , the persistent attack by the government on her father is a symptom of the “ war on terror ” –including the demonization of Arabs and Muslims and the shredding of civil liberties after the September 11 attacks .
“ I think it just shows that the Bush administration is so misguided and hateful of people who are Arab and Muslim , ” she said .
“ It does n’t matter who you are or what you stand for .
In their eyes , all Arabs and all Muslims are the same : they ’re the enemy .
I think they ’ve declared Islam and Muslims as the enemy .
“ It ’s very clear in my father ’s case .
He is a very peaceful and moderate person .
His only crime was exercising his First Amendment rights .
For that , he was punished –silenced by the Bush administration , which has made enemies out of people who should have been their friends , if they truly were interested in bridging the gap between the Muslim world and the U.S.
My father would have been that perfect bridge , but instead they decided to burn their bridges and lock up innocent people …
“ I think this case is not just about us .
It ’s not just about Muslims or Arabs or Palestinians .
It ’s about Americans .
If this could happen to my father , it could happen to anyone . ”
Most people surf the Web , gab on their cell phones , and stop for cash at an automated teller machine ( ATM ) with nary a thought of how they 're able to accomplish these feats .
They simply take for granted that these devices will work at the touch of a button .
Reminder : these devices would be useless were it not for the software that instructs computers to communicate with the Web , cell phones to find signals , and ATMs to confirm that customers are cleared to receive and deposit funds .
In other words , software is the heart and soul of today 's array of gadgets — and , the way it is written is crucial to their operation .
The problem is , however , there is no one manual dictating how it should be written .
In essence , programmers now simply string together commands to make devices do what consumers expect them to do .
There are no rules for software developers to follow , such as those that guide most engineering disciplines , and there is no historical frame of reference code writers can study to determine which approaches work and which do not .
IBM fellow and self - proclaimed " software archaeologist " Grady Booch explains why this needs to change — and what it will take to bring software writing into the 21st century .
You say there 's a " dirty little secret " when it comes to writing software .
Care to share that with us ?
In other disciplines , engineering in particular , there exist treatises on architecture .
This is not the current case in software , which has evolved organically over only the past few decades .
All software - intensive systems have an architecture , but most of the time it 's accidental , not intentional .
This has led to the condition of most software programming knowledge being tribal and existing more in the heads of its programmers than in some reference manual or publicly available resource .
By not having a codified approach to writing software , we 're playing with fire .
How so ?
Our society now runs on software .
As a general rule of thumb , worldwide , software developers produce around 33 billion lines of new or modified code per year , and it quickly becomes outdated as new demands are placed on software .
If I do n't have a sense of the architecture , and I keep piling on code , it becomes a fetid mess .
The danger of this stagnation to a large business is that if a smaller and nimbler competitor comes along with a better way of doing things , the large business has trouble adapting and can easily lose its leadership position in a given market .
There becomes a fundamental economic reason for software architecture then .
This is particularly difficult for growing businesses that are completely based on software , companies like eBay or Google , which do n't actually manufacture anything tangible and yet who rely on software as central to their business .
How big is the problem of haphazard software writing ?
Today 's cumulative mass of software is large .
Given the serious capital investment that has been made in the software that already exists today , it can't easily be changed .
Microsoft at one point decided that Word [ word processing software ] was getting creaky and tried to rewrite it from the ground up [ as part of the 1991 Pyramid program ] .
The problem with that approach is that they never quite got their new Word to match the original software .
They had to go back and work with the code they already had .
What impact does the Web have on software architecture ?
The Web does n't change the basic idea of a software architecture , but rather represents a particular software architecture genre , against which systems can be built .
That being said , there do exist some design " flaws " in the Web ; these " flaws " are not so much evil as they simply could not have been known a priori .
There is poor separation between the Web 's presentation and its semantic layers , which need to be allowed to change independently .
Another challenge is the Web 's underlying TCP / IP [ transmission control protocol / Internet protocol ] protocol , which was never designed to support the streaming video so popular on sites like YouTube .
When TCP / IP receives a request and then provides a response , it breaks up the flow of information , which is a problem when you 're trying to play streaming video .
What can be done to improve software ?
There needs to be a consistent way of writing software that runs on different systems and in different situations that considers a number of different factors :
Is the software running on a single machine with multiple processors or is it running on a cluster of single - processor machines ?
Will all of the software source code go into a single file on the computer , or will it be broken down and executed as multiple scripts ?
How will the software define and use the different data it encounters ?
These are questions that must be answered before the software is written in the first place .
In civil engineering , if you ask someone to build a Victorian house , there is an inherent understanding of what that looks like .
If you ask different programmers to design software for a high - throughput system [ such as one that processes financial transactions ] , there 's no general agreement of how that software should be built .
How can tomorrow 's computer scientists be better prepared to adopt a more universal approach to writing software ?
Because business has pushed advances in software out of necessity for so many years , academia has had to play catch up , rather than teaching and establishing a software architecture for subsequent generations to follow .
One approach is to teach young programmers through a tutorial such as " Alice , " which is a 3 - D software writing program designed to make it easy to create an animation for telling a story , playing an interactive game or making a video to share on the Web .
Alice was created by a team of programmers led by Randy Pausch [ a Carnegie Mellon University professor of computer science , human–computer interaction and design ] and is a freely available teaching tool designed to be a student 's first exposure to fundamental programming concepts .
You 're known as a software archaeologist .
Does that mean you carry a bullwhip and chase down artifacts like an information technology Indiana Jones ?
I approached the board of trustees of the Computer History Museum [ in Mountain View , Calif . ] and told them they should also have a museum of software .
It would be a sad thing … [ for ] … future generations if we did n't have access to the original source code for , say , Word .
I can't find the original source code for [ IBM 's mainframe operating system ] ; not even IBM has it .
It 's hard to get access to some of this software because it 's proprietary and businesses do n't want their competitors to see it .
We 're conducting an archaeological dig for software so that future generations can study it and improve upon it .

Advertisement As Bill Gates prepares to end his full - time work at Microsoft , he tells the BBC in an interview that it was n't just what Microsoft did , but what his rivals did n't do that let Microsoft get ahead .
" Most of our competitors were very poorly run , " he tells Fiona Bruce , for The Money Programme .
" They did not understand how to bring in people with business experience and people with engineering experience and put them together .
They did not understand how to go around the world . "
Sir Alan Sugar , one of Britain 's computer pioneers with his Amstrad range , testifies to Microsoft 's global mobility even as a comparatively small company in the 1980s .
Amstrad , in Brentwood , Essex , was visited by a Microsoft salesman - or " mid-Atlantic smoothie " as Sir Alan describes him - who came to sell Microsoft 's MS - DOS operating system .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Sir Alan declined , telling the salesman he was quite happy with the rival DR - DOS system from Digital Research for his new computer , explaining that " we 're a consumer electronics manufacturer here , we 're not a bunch of geeks , we do n't give a sh** " .
But the Microsoft man would n't take no for an answer , and " was constantly coming back each day " to the Amstrad offices , Sir Alan says , until a deal was done .
Long game Sir Alan believes he got the better of it , buying MS - DOS for a pittance , a figure he 's legally unable to disclose to this day according to the contract he signed with Microsoft .
Most of our competitors were one - product wonders
Bill Gates
Timeline : Bill Gates ' career From Mr Gates ' point of view , it was all part of the long game .
Getting MS - DOS out there was more important than the price of any particular deal .
Debates about Microsoft 's tactics to win dominance of the software industry have been stuck in entrenched positions for years .
On the one side are Microsoft 's competitors , along with some government regulators and courts , arguing that the company has benefited from strong - arm , even illegal practices .
On the other , Mr Gates and his colleagues insist their only purpose in life is to make " great software " and that if customers do n't like it , they would n't choose it .
The interview with Mr Gates adds a new dimension to the debate .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Most of our competitors were one - product wonders , " he says .
" They would do their one product , but never get their engineering sorted out .
" They did not think about software in this broad way .
They did not think about tools or efficiency .
They would therefore do one product , but would not renew it to get it to the next generation . "
Self - serving claims ?
Doug Klunder , a former Microsoft staffer , and the lead programmer for Microsoft 's Excel spreadsheet agrees .
Merely being extremely rich is not the same thing as being an entrepreneur
Open University : Bill Gates - global entrepreneur " People forget that what really launched Microsoft was [ the programming language ] Basic , " he says .
" And then they made the transition to DOS , and then to applications and then to Windows , and managed to do all of those successfully . "
Klunder says it was Mr Gates ' ability to understand the business as well as the technical side that gave Microsoft the edge .
On the other side of the argument is Mitch Kapor , founder of the Lotus Corporation .
Lotus was at one time bigger than Microsoft , thanks to the success of its 1 - 2 - 3 spreadsheet software .
Mr Kapor pulls no punches in his criticisms of Microsoft .
" Claims by Microsoft that people were buying the software because it was good are pretty self - serving , " he says .
" I 'd like to smoke what he was smoking . "
Intermediary Mr Kapor claims that Microsoft " took advantage " of its position in controlling the operating system to make life hard for independent software developers like Lotus .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
When these criticisms are put to Mr Gates , he says he finds it " ironic " that he could be accused of such a thing when Microsoft had " evangelised " its software to other companies , begging them " please write software for our platform " .
And when the criticism is attributed to Mr Kapor , Mr Gates says that he had personally visited Lotus " so many times " to plead with the company to adapt 1 - 2 - 3 to work on Windows .
In a sense , it is possible for both sides of the argument to be right .
On the one hand , Microsoft did hold the fate of other software companies in its hands .
When it decided to develop Windows , smaller companies had to fall in line with Microsoft 's plans , or risk disaster .
But it is also true that because of the success of Microsoft software , its operating system became the intermediary between one industry , of application developers , and another , the computer manufacturers .
Slow response ?
Heidi Roizen is a software entrepreneur who became a friend of Mr Gates .
She says of Microsoft that " because they were the operating system , everyone else in the industry had to deal with them " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Microsoft 's clout was , by this argument , unavoidable .
Mr Gates himself attributes the success of Microsoft 's own applications in 1995 - providing a second great profit centre alongside the operating systems business - to the tardiness of other companies in shipping products ready for Windows .
" We tried to get everyone who did productivity software to come along and support Windows , " he says .
" But they were quite slow , so our own Windows applications , Word , Excel , were doing incredibly well . "
' Conservative approach '
Others will say it was n't as simple as that .
But there is a final essential element in the Microsoft formula , which is indisputable : its use of massive cash mountains to insulate itself against the vagaries of the market or the failure of a particular product .
Mr Gates describes this as his " conservative balance sheet approach " .
In the early days , Mr Gates explains , he needed money in the bank to provide security for the families of his first dozen employees , most of whom had shown enough faith in him to move to Albuquerque , New Mexico , the location of Microsoft 's first office .
But as the company expanded he wanted " great financial strength so we would have the flexibility to do software in the new way , or whatever we wanted to do " .
Mr Gates is proud to claim " we are very conservative " , and points out that " even today , if you look at the Microsoft balance sheet , you will see that we keep quite a bit of cash on hand " .
Well , yes , more than $ 25 bn should be enough for a good few rainy days .

REUTERS / Mushtaq Muhammed
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday defeated legislation that would have funded the war in Iraq for another year , in a surprise move that the Senate could overturn .
By a vote of 149 - 141 , the Democrat - controlled House rejected a measure that would have given the Pentagon $ 162.5 billion to keep the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan running through next summer , slightly below President George W. Bush ’s request .
A large group of anti-war House Democrats voted against the funds .
That , coupled with 132 Republicans voting “ present , ” meaning neither “ yes ” nor “ no , ” killed the measure for now .
But the Senate is expected to debate its version of a war - funding bill possibly next week and is likely to resurrect the money for the coming year .

AT&T wants to start filtering Bittorrent
Thought Comcast - type traffic shaping was bad ?
Then better do n't switch to At&T anytime soon .
They seem to have even worse ideas .
The New York Times is reporting now that AT&T has been talking to the RIAA , the MPAA and companies offering filtering solutions for the last half year .
The goal : Filter copyrighted content out of your P2P traffic .
The Times quotes AT&T senior vice president saying the following on a CES panel : This announcement comes on the heels of a statement from FCC Chairman Kevin Martin that his agency wants to investigate Comcast 's Bittorrent filtering .
Martin told the audience of a CES panel on Tuesday that he wants to make sure that " no consumer is going to be blocked " .
Maybe he can take a look at AT&Ts plans next .
But but but , Ohio is full of white working class , blue collar , beer drinking , lunchpail toting , bowling shoe wearing people that Obama can't win .
Is n't it ?
Oh , mourn the death of conventional wisdom that you see here .
A new Public Policy Polling survey finds Sen. Barack Obama begins the general election in Ohio with a double digit lead over John McCain , 50 % to 39 % .
It 's a major improvement from most recent previous Ohio poll , taken at the height of the Jeremiah Wright controversy in March , which showed Obama trailing McCain 49 % to 41 % .

" This [ lack of appetite suppression ] may promote greater food intake after exercise in obese women , " said Katarina Borer , PhD , a University of Michigan researcher and lead author of the study .
" This information will help therapists and physicians understand the limitations of exercise in appetite control for weight loss in obese people . "
Borer and her co-workers sought to better understand how changes in body fat level influence appetite and a hormone called leptin , which in animals curbs appetite when body fat increases .
When leptin levels rise , it supposedly shuts off appetite and motivates physical activity to burn calories .
However , as obese people become fatter , their leptin levels rise , but they become resistant to the actions of this hormone .
" The hormone does n't do the job it 's supposed to do in lean people , " Borer said .
In research funded by the National Institutes of Health , Borer 's group studied 20 postmenopausal women : 10 lean and 10 obese women .
The women ate three weight - maintenance meals a day while participating in three experiments on three separate days .
During one experiment they did not exercise .
In the other two experiments the women exercised on a treadmill in the morning and the afternoon .
They burned 500 calories each time , for a total of 1,000 calories a day .
These two experiments differed by exercise intensity .
One involved walking at high intensity , or 80 percent of maximal effort , for 7.5 minutes , with 10 - minute rest periods between 10 walking sessions .
The other experiment was half as intense ( 40 percent of peak effort ) and involved walking for 15 minutes and resting for 5 minutes .
Every hour and before each meal , subjects recorded their appetite level on a 10 - point scale ranging from not at all hungry to extremely hungry .
Blood samples were collected every 15 to 60 minutes for hormone measurements .
Obese women claimed they were less hungry than lean women before meals and reported no appetite suppression during exercise , Borer said .
As expected , obese women had much higher leptin levels than in lean women , study data showed .
But during intense exercise , obese women did not have reduced production of leptin , as lean women did .
Only moderate - intensity exercise lowered leptin in obese women .
" Obesity interferes with leptin 's detection of exercise energy expenditure and with appetite suppression , " Borer said .
" Obese women perhaps need to consciously watch their calories because some of the hormonal satiety [ fullness ] signals do n't seem to work as well . "
The results were presented Tuesday , June 17 , at The Endocrine Society 's 90th Annual Meeting in San Francisco .
After Miami handyman Glenn Rudge was accused of shoplifting an $ 8 set of drill bits at Home Depot , he thought he'd settled the matter when he showed his receipt to prosecutors and they dropped the charge .
But a few weeks later , a law firm hired by Home Depot began sending him letters demanding first $ 3,000 , then a total of $ 6,000 , implying he'd be sued if he did n't pay it .

If you ’ve decided to get out there on the world wide web and start your very own website or blog , the first thing that has to be taken care of is finding a reliable web host .
This chore might seem extremely straight forward , although , it ’s not quite as easy as picking a new pair of stylish pants at your local retailer .
Bellow you will find a list of helpful tips for choosing a good web hosting company .
Bandwidth
Most people will tell you that the more bandwidth ( transfer ) you have the better .
This might even sound like a reasonable proposition , but if you take the time to think about it carefully , having unlimited bandwidth is a blessing in disguise .
Web hosting companies know perfectly well what their clients are looking for , and nothing gets inexperienced users salivating uncontrollably like unlimited or exceedingly generous bandwidth limits .
What you should know right from the beginning is that bandwidth costs money , a lot of money for that matter , so deciding on a plan advertising unlimited bandwidth for only $ 5 per month is asking for trouble .
Web host offering such bargains are usually the first to throttle bandwidth once a client stars consuming recourses at a lofty pace .
For most users 10 G monthly bandwidth is more than they will ever use .
Storage space
To a certain extent , storage space is more important than large amounts of bandwidth .
The reason for this is simple .
Most sites created nowadays are what we call dynamic sites , in other words , sites that are constantly being updated with new content .
As time passes , you might find that space becomes increasingly limited because of all the content that has been added over the years .
When you acquire hosting , most hosts offer around 5 G storage space with their cheapest package and anywhere between 300 g to unlimited space when choosing a premium plan .
Databases
Just to give you an idea , in order to install a blog , forum , content management system ( CMS ) , image gallery or online store , you need a database .
If your site will have a few of the functionalities mentioned above , the odds are you will need one database for each individual script .
When comparing hosting packages make sure they include at least 10 MySQL databases .
Easy script installers
Easy script installers or site builders provide a convenient solution for those that are to some extent computer illiterate .
Installing a script can be complicated especially if you do n’t know how to create databases , configure scripts or simply find it confusing to understand all those technical terms used by computer geeks .
Easy script installers or site builders only require a few clicks to install a fully functioning site .
Other important features
In technical terms , the only other thing you should worry about is language support for PHP , Perl , Java , Python CGI and ColdFusion .
This information is usually provided on the web host ’s site since it is essential if you wish to install a complicated script or media rich site .

28th , 2008 10:16 am Grotendous Hack !
( Wheee ! )
Today on " Grotendous Hack " , my own personal corner¹ of the Coding Horror / Daily WTF world , I present : The Shadow Database !
So last Thursday night we performed a major server migration .
Our main box had served our company long and well , but it was becoming overtaxed and it was time to move it not just to a new machine , but to a new cluster of machines .
We prepared and overprepared and Murphy struck exactly as anticipated .
Things went wrong , plan B's were resorted to , and after 3.5 hours our half - hour migration was complete and everything was cut over to the new boxes .
And there was much rejoicing² .
Friday morning Ralph , our analyst , came in and said , " Umm , I ca n't run reports . "
I had some spare cycles so I was given the task to resolve it .
Never mind that I 'm the new guy ... how hard could this be ?
It would not be long before I discovered why everyone else volunteered to be unavailable for that task ....
So , here 's his reporting system :
He has his own database server , it 's this tiny little 500MHz box running ...
Windows XP .
Okay , this is new to me .
I was n't even aware of this machine , and Ralph says he only has read access to it so I 'm guessing it 's just a cache machine .
He 's probably got a script that downloads and imports the nightly backup .
Should n't be too hard .
Then Ralph says , " So , first I start SSH ... " and I say " ... what ? "
He pulls up this obviously homegrown app with two buttons and a blinkenlight .
The buttons say " Start SSH " and " Stop SSH " , and the blinkenlight is either red or green .
It 's currently red .
" Um . What 's that ? " I ask .
I get that sick I - just - fell - down - a- rabbithole feeling as Ralph launches the Visual Basic IDE and starts showing me code ....
So .
Fast forward an hour , and here 's how it all works :
There is no database on that machine .
The VB app creates an SSH tunnel ( port forward ) direct to the database server .
The DB servers do n't accept remote connections , so this little VB app makes this Windows box behave like a MySQL server .
Okay , as a hack it 's fairly clever .
Riding on top of the SSH tunnel is an ODBC driver that connects to localhost :3306 and provides an ODBC connection .
All right , this sort of makes sense .
Nobody remembers who wrote the original VB app , but we have source code and anyway I just need to find the code that creates the SSH tunnel and point it at the new server , right ?
What could possibly go wrong ?
Ugh .
So one other detail : we renamed the database when we moved it .
We carefully tuned all the other application code to make sure nobody was hardcoding database names .
A quick scan through the VB app showed that it was n't hardcoding either .
Okay ... all I have to do is open the ODBC connector and change the database , and ...
... and the new database name is too long to fit in the ODBC adapter 's text box .
Who makes a database connector that only accepts 20 characters for the database name ?!?
Especially when ODBC allows up to 64 ?
Our new database name is 24 characters long .
So .
I spent the weekend thinking my way around this .
Update the ODBC drivers ?
Worth trying .
Rename the database again ?
No way , not gonna happen .
On the way to work Tuesday , the solution hit me : I would create a shadow database .
Every table in the database would actually be a view - - a view on the original table .
So yeah .
In pseudocode , it looked like this : for table in db1.tables do execute " CREATE VIEW shadow.#{table} AS SELECT * FROM db1.#{table} " end In practice ?
It works great .
It 's gory and gross , and best of all , I did n't have to change -- by which I mean , take ownership of -- the VB project .
Now , two problems immediately appear with this code : the first is that a developer might stumble onto the shadow database and wonder what the heck it is .
Our team is pretty good at communicating , but better safe than sorry .
I created a table called _README_ with one column , readme , and filled it with a blurb explaining the purpose and weirdnesses of the database .
Now if somebody decides to properly fix the issue later but does n't destroy the shadow database , a maintenance programmer can know that he can wipe it out .
The second problem is that MySQL caches the table definition when it creates the view .
If we migrate the database , it might break the views .
To solve that , I simply wrote a script to destroy and rebuild the shadow database ( including recreating the _README_ table ) .
So ... yeah .
Pretty grotendous .
But I kinda like it .
It desperately needs a good refactoring , for example , we 're building an in - house database server that will slave replicate from the master , and when it 's done we can just have Ralph connect straight to that , obviating the need for the custom SSH tunnel app for Windows ³ .
¹ or contribution , if you prefer .
² yes , we ate Robin 's minstrels .
³ some of you may be thinking , " Why no just use PuTTY 's plink . exe program ? "
Answer : we do .
The VB app shells out to plink .
And then it provides a blinkenlight .
If you have to ask , you clearly do not understand the value of a good blinkenlight .

This is nasty from the beginning to the end .

Allow connection from the intranet and make it clean .
Every times you create a new table , you have to create a new view ?!?!

( Link ) I completely agree .
It is pretty appalling , innit .
I agree that it is utter befoulment .
But removing any foulness would require an expenditure of time I 'm unwilling to give .
For example , how would Ralph connect to an intranet database , if he cannot connect to DSNs longer than 20 characters ?
Answer :
Well , the ODBC drivers are -- no , stop .
See , we 're all outta time for that problem .
As for creating a new view for every table ?
Yes .
It 's even worse than that , though : you also have to drop and recreate a view if you change an existing view .
That 's why I wrapped it up as a script .
If and only if you make a change that needs to go into the reporting module -- which is MUCH more stable than the database schema itself -- you just run ./ make_shadow_database and it rebuilds the entire list of views .
Herein lies wisdom : it 's nasty entrails and disgusting hackery , but it 's not hard to work with .
That 's the dual horror / beauty of this hack , really ; and it's the reason I posted it in the first place .
See , I wrote this up as a horror story : " You 're not going to believe what 's in the box !
It 's all tentacles and chicken entrails ! "
But if you put the lid on the box and step back and look at it , it 's a box that generates the reports we were always able to get .
Work goes on .
Life goes on .
I did n't fix the maintenance nightmare , it is true .
But I did n't make it any worse , and in fact , the problem is now better documented and better understood for the next programmer that has to open that box and fish around in it .

Join us now as we take a look at about a dozen or so more examples of Ugg - wear in LA .
The boots just keep getting bigger and furrier and more complicated until it is unclear if that 's a Yeti or an urban hipster approaching until they are 6 feet away , in which case it may simply be too late .
For a brief moment I believed that by taking photographs people would see how utterly ridiculous this trend has become and the abused - and - ashamed boots could crawl back up into the bottom hem of the pant legs where they belong , finding a safe haven beneath the bottom third of a boot cut pant , relieved they no longer have to be the prime focus of a stupid outfit .
I honestly hoped this would wear off over time , and as the feet got warmer and the butts got colder ( and the funny tan lines became laughable come summer time ) , the boots would walk themselves back into the closet and save themselves for a more appropriate use .
People 's feet are dressed for winter and their bellies are dressed for summer ( yes , that 's a mere 5 degree difference here in LA , but you know what I 'm getting at ) .
First I want to know where are all of these footless yetis living now ?
What do the poachers do with their bodies after severing them from their ankles ?
Has anyone considered creating an organization to provide prosthetics for the poor guys ?
Maybe it 's just my cynicism shining through , but it seems common sense is no longer hip and has gone to the wayside .
What better way to illustrate the cumulative decline in thinking than to wear an outfit that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever ?
I mean , at least get the Ugg flip - flop , which is more appropriate beachwear .
I am no fashion guru ( and if you ever meet me you will know I 'm hardly even an apprentice ) , but I remember hearing on some TLC makeover show that long continuous lines make your legs look longer and slimmer .
I 'm not sure if general logic properties apply to fashion ensembles , but I would derive from the above rule that choppy lines with chunky boots make your legs look shorter and fatter , and according to modern wisdom ( Oprah ) , that 's not desirable .
My cats have been asking me to get these .
It reminds them of the toys that are attached to their cat condo and they appear to be constructed from real live bunnies , two of my cats ' natural prey .
( I told the cats that on principle I will not spend $ 200 on a pair of shoes which are host to fleas , they do n't seem to understand , but they have n't had to work a day in their lives so they have no appreciation for money or what things cost these days . )
Since no one goes halfway here in Los Angeles , now there is a clamoring of urban hipsters to try to outdo each other by adding decals and patches and bling to the boots to make them " individual " and " unique . "
You can have them airbrushed by a company in Washington or get them with patches to represent who you are !
I apologize for the poor quality of this photo but the woman is wearing pink furry boots with a sparkly rhinestone skull and crossbones on them , which I could not let go .
And what has become of our youth ?
They no longer concern themselves with the everlasting perils of arch support ?
The $ 150 dead animal boot is now the workout shoe of choice for America 's perkiest cheerleading squads ?
Honestly ladies , I do n't think these boots were made for walking ( or dancing / jumping / spinning ) , I think the greatest amount of strain they are intended for is the lazy post - surfing munchies .
These furry white things have become so prevalent in Los Angeles , that now you can get them for your ( sigh ) American Girl Dolls .
I feel fortunate my brain did n't implode when I saw these things , though they are quite impressively similar to the boots women are wearing around here , I give the American Girl Project Runway crew some props for that .
Speaking of the children , it appears kids put these things on and turn into the animal that their feet most resemble , which must be detrimental to the development of a secure identity ( is n't childhood hard enough ? ) , and confusing for the family pets .
Here we have a child who believes she is a bear .
As far as I remember ( but I 've only lived here for 25 years , what do I know ? ) ,
Angelinos were n't so big on killing things in the name of fashion .
So why is it suddenly okay to put pink sheep on the endangered species list ?
Have you ever seen a pink sheep ?
Now you know why .
Its lifeless pelt is stomping around at the Grove buying Victoria 's Secret sweatpants and iced blendeds at the Coffee Bean .
Tell that to its orphaned pink baby lamb .
Pamela Anderson sure did .
Exploring Dynamic Scoping in Python
Experimenting with Code Objects & Bytecode
Introduction Ruby has anonymous code blocks , Python does n't .
Anonymous code blocks are ( apparently ) an important feature in implementing DSL s , much touted by Ruby protaganists .
As far as I can tell , the major difference between code block in Ruby and functions in Python is that code blocks are executed in the current scope .
You can rebind local variables in the scope in which the code block is executed .
Python functions have a lexical scope , with the execption that you can't rebind variables in the enclosing scope .
Note
It turns out that this is wrong .
Ruby code blocks are lexically scoped like Python functions .
This article is really an exploration of dynamic scoping .
If you define a function inside a function or method which uses the variable ' x ' , this will be loaded from the scope in which the function was defined ; not the scope in which it is executed .
This is enormously useful , but perhaps not always the desired behaviour .
If a function assigns to the variable ' x ' this will always be inside the scope of the function and not affect the scope the function was defined in or executed in .
I thought it would be fun to try and implement this feature of anonymous code blocks for Python , using code objects .
This should be a fun way to learn more about the implementation of Python scoping rules by experimenting with byte - code .
If this sounds like it 's a hack , then it 's only because it is .
It is interesting to note however that Aspect Oriented Programming is a well accepted technique in Java , and is mainly implemented at the bytecode level .
This article looks at the byte - code operations used in code objects and experiments with creating new ones .
Although the details of the byte - codes are shown , no great technical knowledge should be needed to follow the article .
Code Objects
Python does n't have code blocks .
It does have code objects .
These can be executed in the current scope , but they are inconvenient to create inside a program .
The code must be stored as a string , compiled and then executed . >> > x = 3
>> > codeString = " print x
x = 7
"
>> > codeObject = compile ( codeString , '< CodeString > ' , ' exec ' )
>> > exec codeObject
3
>> > print x
7
>> >
Functions store a code object representing the body of the function as the func_code attribute .
For a reference on function attributes , see the function type .
The byte - code contains instructions telling the interpreter how to load and store values .
It is a combination of the function attributes and the byte - code , including code object attributes , that implement the scoping rules .
You can't just execute the code object of a function : >> > x = 3
>> > def function ( ) :
. . . print x
. . . x = 7
. . .
>> > codeObject = function .
func_code
>> > exec codeObject
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in ?
File " < stdin > " , line 2 , in function
UnboundLocalError : local variable ' x ' referenced before assignment
>> >
The co_freevars attribute of the code object contains a list of the variables from the enclosing scope used by the code object .
Their are various other attributes like co_varnames which tell the interpreter how to load names .
For a reference on code objects , see : Code Objects ( Unofficial Reference Wiki ) .
Code objects are immutable , or at least the interesting attributes are read only , so we can't just change the attributes we are interested in .
We can create new code objects .
The documentation does n't seem to encourage this though : >> > x = 3
>> > from types import CodeType
>> > print CodeType .
__doc__
code ( argcount , nlocals , stacksize , flags , codestring , constants , names ,
varnames , filename , name , firstlineno , lnotab [ , freevars [ , cellvars ] ] )
Create a code object .
Not for the faint of heart .
>> >
In order to implement code blocks I would like to take the code objects from a function and transform them into ones which can be executed in the current scope .
There is an interesting recipe which transforms bytecodes and creates new code objects in this way : Implementing the make statement by hacking bytecodes .
Luckily there is an easier way .
Byte -Codes
There is a great module called Byteplay .
This lets you manipulate byte - codes and create new code objects .
Ideal for my purposes .
It is also great for exploring byte - codes .
Let 's see what the byte - code looks like for some functions .
The Python Byte Code Instructions comes in handy here .
The following Python creates three code blocks and uses Byteplay to print out the names of the byte - codes operations .
The three code blocks come from a function which is defined in the global scope , the same code ( without the argument ' x ' ) compiled from a string in the global scope , and a function defined inside another function .
from byteplay import Code
from pprint import pprint
z = 1
def testFunction ( x ) :
y = 1
print x
print y
print z
print ' From Function : '
code = Code .
from_code ( testFunction . func_code )
byteCode1 = code .
code
pprint ( byteCode1 )
codeObject = compile ( " " "
y = 1
print y
print z " " " , '< Summink > ' , ' exec ' )
print
print ' From current scope : '
code = Code .
from_code ( codeObject )
byteCode2 = code .
code
pprint ( byteCode2 )
def anotherScope ( ) :
z = 1
def testFunction ( x ) :
y = 1
print x
print y
print z
code = Code .
from_code ( testFunction . func_code )
byteCode3 = code .
code
return byteCode3
byteCode3 = anotherScope ( )
print
print ' Code defined in another scope , using a local rather than a global . '
pprint ( byteCode3 )
This prints out the following ( you do n't need to read it all ) : From Function : [ ( SetLineno , 6 ) , ( LOAD_CONST , 1 ) , ( STORE_FAST , 'y ' ) , ( SetLineno , 7 ) , ( LOAD_FAST , 'x ' ) , ( PRINT_ITEM , None ) , ( PRINT_NEWLINE , None ) , ( SetLineno , 8 ) , ( LOAD_FAST , 'y ' ) , ( PRINT_ITEM , None ) , ( PRINT_NEWLINE , None ) , ( SetLineno , 9 ) , ( LOAD_GLOBAL , 'z ' ) , ( PRINT_ITEM , None ) , ( PRINT_NEWLINE , None ) , ( LOAD_CONST , None ) , ( RETURN_VALUE , None ) ]
From current scope : [ ( SetLineno , 2 ) , ( LOAD_CONST , 1 ) , ( STORE_NAME , 'y ' ) , ( SetLineno , 3 ) , ( LOAD_NAME , 'y ' ) , ( PRINT_ITEM , None ) , ( PRINT_NEWLINE , None ) , ( SetLineno , 4 ) , ( LOAD_NAME , 'z ' ) , ( PRINT_ITEM , None ) , ( PRINT_NEWLINE , None ) , ( LOAD_CONST , None ) , ( RETURN_VALUE , None ) ]
Code defined in another scope , using a local rather than a global .
[ ( SetLineno , 66 ) , ( LOAD_CONST , 1 ) , ( STORE_FAST , 'y ' ) , ( SetLineno , 67 ) , ( LOAD_FAST , 'x ' ) , ( PRINT_ITEM , None ) , ( PRINT_NEWLINE , None ) , ( SetLineno , 68 ) , ( LOAD_FAST , 'y ' ) , ( PRINT_ITEM , None ) , ( PRINT_NEWLINE , None ) , ( SetLineno , 69 ) , ( LOAD_DEREF , 'z ' ) , ( PRINT_ITEM , None ) , ( PRINT_NEWLINE , None ) , ( LOAD_CONST , None ) , ( RETURN_VALUE , None ) ]
In summary , this tells us : Store a local variable : STORE_FAST Load an argument : LOAD_FAST
Load a variable local to function : LOAD_FAST
Load a global : LOAD_GLOBAL
Load a value from the enclosing scope : LOAD_DEREF
Load a value from the same scope : LOAD_NAME
Store a value in the same scope : STORE_NAME
So in order to rescope a code block to execute in the current scope , we need to transform LOAD_FAST and LOAD_DEREF into LOAD_NAME , and STORE_FAST and STORE_DEREF ( which we have n't seen here ) into STORE_NAME .
Transforming Byte-codes
The Byteplay module allows us to iterate over the opcodes .
It stores them as a list of tuples .
Because lists are mutable we can replace the byte - codes we are interested in .
The Byteplay module also has a dictionary called opmap , which is a mapping of opcode names to their symbolic values .
from byteplay import Code , opmap
LOAD_FAST = opmap [ ' LOAD_FAST ' ]
STORE_FAST = opmap [ ' STORE_FAST ' ]
LOAD_NAME = opmap [ ' LOAD_NAME ' ]
STORE_NAME = opmap [ ' STORE_NAME ' ]
LOAD_DEREF = opmap [ ' LOAD_DEREF ' ]
STORE_DEREF = opmap [ ' STORE_DEREF ' ]
def AnonymousCodeBlock ( function ) :
code = Code .
from_code ( function .
func_code )
newBytecode = [ ]
for opcode , arg in code .
code :
if opcode in ( LOAD_FAST , LOAD_DEREF ) :
opcode = LOAD_NAME
elif opcode in ( STORE_FAST , STORE_DEREF ) :
opcode = STORE_NAME
newBytecode .
append ( ( opcode , arg ) )
At the start of the function AnonymousCodeBlock we use Code. from_code to turn the function byte - code object into a Byteplay object .
By the end , so far , we have a list newBytecode which holds our transformed bytecode .
There is one more step .
We need to turn this back into a code object , but one which executes in the current scope .
This means that we need to set the freevars attribute to ( ) ( empty ) and the newlocals attribute to False .
code .
code = new Bytecode
code .
newlocals = False
code .
freevars = ( )
return code .
to_code ( )
Because we 're not interested in functions which take arguments , we ought to check the function we 've been passed .
inspect.getargspec makes this easy .
The full AnonymousCodeBlock , looks like this .
import inspect
from byteplay import Code , opmap
LOAD_FAST = opmap [ ' LOAD_FAST ' ]
STORE_FAST = opmap [ ' STORE_FAST ' ]
LOAD_NAME = opmap [ ' LOAD_NAME ' ]
STORE_NAME = opmap [ ' STORE_NAME ' ]
LOAD_DEREF = opmap [ ' LOAD_DEREF ' ]
STORE_DEREF = opmap [ ' STORE_DEREF ' ]
def AnonymousCodeBlock ( function ) :
argSpec = inspect .
getargspec ( function )
if [ i for x in argSpec if x is not None for i in x ] :
raise TypeError ( " Function ' %s ' takes arguments " % function .
func_name )
code = Code .
from_code ( function .
func_code )
newBytecode = [ ]
for opcode , arg in code .
code :
if opcode in ( LOAD_FAST , LOAD_DEREF ) :
opcode = LOAD_NAME
elif opcode in ( STORE_FAST , STORE_DEREF ) :
opcode = STORE_NAME
newBytecode .
append ( ( opcode , arg ) )
code .
code = new Bytecode
code .
newlocals = False
code .
freevars = ( )
return code .

With gasoline prices nearing record levels , many drivers are trying to adopt ways to reduce the amount of gas their car uses .
That 's a noble goal , but do n't fall for some common myths that , in some cases , will end up costing you money .
The average national price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas was $ 3.04 Wednesday , according to AAA .
Crude oil , which closed at $ 87.34 a barrel in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , has flirted with the $ 100 - a - barrel mark in recent weeks .
That is near the inflation - adjusted highs set in the early 1980s .
Here are 10 gas - saving myths that you should know to make sure you are truly saving money on gas , rather than putting money , time and effort into something that wo n't work :
1. Products claiming to increase gas mileage
: The Federal Trade Commission has tested more than 100 devices that claim to save gas -- some up to 25 % -- and found not one that significantly improves gas mileage as claimed .
In fact , the FTC found that some may actually
damage the car 's engine .
You can also see the test results of such devices by the
Environmental Protection Agency .
Consumer Reports
has also tested numerous products over the years that make the improved - mileage claim
and have n't found any that actually work .
2 . Turn off the AC
: This is the classic debate that will keep people arguing for hours .
According to a
Consumer Reports
test , there is
very little difference between driving with your windows down or with the air conditioner on at 65 mph on the highway .
Edmunds
came to a
similar conclusion .
3. Buy gas on Wednesday
: The theory is that if you buy gas on Wednesday , prices have come down from the weekend , when many gas stations elevate their prices in hopes of making a bit more profit from more people traveling .
While a general rule would be to avoid buying on weekends , there are too many factors that come into play to rely on the Wednesday strategy .
You are much better off looking at what gas stations are charging in your area through sites like
AAA 's fuel price check ,
GasBuddy or
Gas Price
Watch to find the best price on a daily basis .
4. Idle away
: At one time , this may have been true , but with modern fuel - injection technology , it 's no longer the case .
Just as there is no longer a need to spend 10 minutes warming up your car on a cold morning , if you are going to be sitting for more than a half minute , you will save more gas by turning the engine off than letting it continue to run .
5. Sticker stats
: The rating that automakers provide for gas mileage should be taken with a grain of salt .
Beginning with 2008 vehicle models , the Environmental Protection Agency
required fuel efficiency standards to be reported based on new test methods that better reflect actual driving conditions .
Older models , however , may have derived their ratings via outdated or inaccurate methods .
While differences in manufacturer - devised MPG ratings will indicate one car is more fuel efficient than another , that is about all you can deduct from this number .
You are better off looking at real - world mileage tests from
Edmunds
and
Consumer Reports
if you want a good idea of what gas mileage your car will really get .
6 . Up your octane
: A higher grade of gas is not necessarily better for your car .
Some higher - performance car engines need a higher octane level , which refers simply to how much the fuel can be compressed before it ignites .
It 's a myth that higher - octane fuel burns hotter and cleaner , and it will not improve an ordinary car 's gas mileage .
Your driver 's manual will list the recommended level of octane , which will usually be the lowest .
7 . Gas rebate cards save money
: This is one of those areas where you need to be very careful .
On the face of things , getting a 3 % to 5 % rebate each time you purchase gas looks like a no - brainer , but this is not always the case .
If you do n't pay off the card in full each month , any savings on gas will immediately be taken away with interest charges .
Some gas cards may come with yearly fees that can negate any savings .
There also may be less expensive gas in your area that does n't allow a credit card to be used .
Run the numbers before assuming that a gas credit card will save money .
8 . Buy a fuel - efficient car
: Many people believe that the best way to save gas is to purchase a fuel efficient car .
While this will help , the truth is that the best way to save money on gas is to change your driving habits .
Making basic changes to your driving habits
will save you a lot more money than changing to a fuel efficient car without changing your habits .
Getting a fuel efficient car on top of changing your habits will be even a bigger bonus .
9 . Gas up in the morning
: This myth is based on the science that gas is denser when it is cool out than in the heat of the day .
The logic goes that purchasing gas in the morning , when it is cool , will mean you get more in your tank than if you buy it in the heat of the afternoon , because gas pumps measure volume and not density of the fuel .
The problem is that the gas is stored in underground tanks , so the heat of the day has little effect on the gas temperature , meaning you can purchase gas at any time and get virtually the same amount .
But there is one reason you might want to buy gas in the morning .
If you believe gas prices are going to be rising , most gas stations do n't change their daily price until 8 a.m. or so , meaning you still can get the previous day 's price in the early morning .
10 . Overinflated tires will save gas
: The logic is that if underinflated tires waste gas and properly inflated tires get better mileage because of less tread contact on the road , over inflated tires would have even less tread contact , which would increase mileage .
Popular Mechanics
tested this theory and found that it did n't provide any added benefit and that it was
dangerous .
Increasing your fuel efficiency as much as possible is sensible , but make sure that you do n't buy into the myths that can be dangerous and siphon your wallet .

Ex -Clinton consultant cheers McGovern 's ' guts ' Former South Darkota Senator George McGovern has reversed his endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton and urged her to drop out of the race for president following her showing in Indiana and North Carolina .
McGovern says he now endorses Barack Obama .
He was the Democratic nominee in 1972 , when he lost to then - President Richard Nixon .
McGovern himself was instrumental in the current nominating process , which weighs caucuses and primaries more heavily than superdelegates .
The 85 - year - old Democrat was named chairman of a Democratic Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection in 1969 .
In part , due to his urging , the commission cut back the power of party officials and insiders and increased the roles of caucuses and primaries .
Ex -Clinton
White House strategist lauds call " Bully for him [ McGovern ] for having the guts , wisdom , and leadership to say it because that 's what 's on the minds of a lot of people in the party these days and they do n't have the guts to say that they do n't want Hillary to be the Democratic nominee , " Kitty Kurth , a former Clinton White House consultant and Democratic strategist from Chicago , told RAW STORY Wednesday .
" That does n't mean that we like Bill or Hillary any less .
It 's just that different times call for different leadership . "
Kurth , who now runs a strategy firm called Kurth Lampe , is busy working on the 6th District Congressional race in Illinois , Rep. Henry Hyde 's old district .
She says she 's neutral in the presidential race this cycle .
" I 'm officially neutral , " Kurth said .
" I was very lucky when I worked with the Clintons and the Gores when they were in the White House .
I am personally thankful for all the opportunities they gave me but it 's time to move on . "
Kurth said that McGovern is showing the kind of leadership others in the party need to demonstrate and the math is all pointing to Obama .
" The math was done by Jonathan Alter and Slate.com months ago and it's only gotten worse for Hillary , " she said .
" Her speech last night was schizophrenic .
At one point she was almost going to concede and the next second , she 's saying she 's on to West Virginia .
She needs to end this but the longer she waits , the harder it 's going to be for her and for the party .
It 's a tough decision . "
Kurth added that she did n't think it was a bad idea to let other states normally not involved in the presidential primary to get a chance to organize and vote this time around .
" Keep the primary going but take the gloves off , " she said .
" Let 's make this more of a boxing match rather than a street brawl like it has been for the last couple of weeks . "
Correction : Kurth 's last name was incorrectly spelled in an earlier edition .
The reality is that , for the vast majority of people they provide no benefits whatsoever .
In a significant minority they cause horribly unpleasant and often debilitating side - effects .
But with a fifty billion dollar industry resting on them , they are aggressively marketed and pushed relentlessly .
Dr Kendrick contends that the bottom line with statins is this :
If you are a man who is already suffering from heart disease , statins can increase your life expectancy .
Not by much , but they do work .
For everyone else , statins do not increase life expectancy by one , single , day .
So there is absolutely no point in taking them , at all .

The debate over the U.S. policy towards Iraq ( and the debate over the debate ) has taken several twists and turns over the course of five long and painful years , but if there ’s one thing I thought the entire Republican establishment agreed on , it ’s this : do n’t disagree with Gen. David Petraeus .
His judgment is sacrosanct , his word is gold , and his assessments of conditions in Iraq are unimpeachable .
Why , then , are John McCain and Dick Cheney contradicting Petraeus publicly ?
Just four days ago , Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , said that “ no one ” in the U.S. and Iraqi governments “ feels that there has been sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation , ” or in the provision of basic public services .
As it turns out , “ no one ” does n’t include John McCain , who feels there ’s been plenty of progress …
“ Anybody who believes the surge has not succeeded , militarily , politically and in most other ways , frankly , does not know the facts on the ground . ”
… nor does it include Dick Cheney , who apparently sees political progress Petraeus does n’t .
U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney on Monday declared the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq a “ successful endeavor , ” pointing to security and political progress on a visit ahead of the fifth anniversary of the war .
A new schism between Petraeus and Republican leaders ?
Well , probably not .
It ’s far more likely that McCain and Cheney have their political talking points to read , and do n’t much care whether they contradict Petraeus ’ comments or not .

A new Public Policy Polling poll of Democrats in the state of Oregon released today found that Barack Obama is enjoying a 14 point lead over Hillary Clinton .
Obama leads Clinton in the state 53% - 39 % .
Obama leads with voters in every racial category , and every age group except those over age 65 .
In a little bit of a surprise , Obama has his biggest lead with voters age 30 - 45 .
He beats Clinton among this group by an almost 2 to 1 margin , 60 % - 33 % .
Obama leads among Hispanic voters , a group that he has struggled with throughout the campaign , 58% - 33 % .
He has a small three point lead among women 48 % - 45 % , and dominates with male voters , 60 % - 31 % .
Unlike all other states this year , Oregon Democrats listed the Iraq war as their top issue ( 41 % ) .
Second was the economy and jobs ( 34 % ) .
Third was healthcare ( 11 % ) .
Obama leads Clinton 63 % - 31 % for those who the war the top issue .
Clinton does better on the economy where she only trails 48 % - 44 % , and she leads Obama on healthcare 48 % - 46 % .

Oregon is one of the younger demographic states in the country , so it fits into the pattern that we have seen in this race .
States with lots of younger voters go for Obama .
The older voter states prefer Clinton .
If the superdelegates continue to flow in , a big win in Oregon would not only offset a big Clinton win in Kentucky , but might be enough to put him over the top .
Oregon is an interesting state .
Although John McCain is already campaigning there for Independent voters , it looks like fertile Obama country .
In most of the close primaries , voters ages 30 - 45 have decided the race .
Early on these voters went for Clinton , but in both Indiana and Oregon we have seen them swing towards Obama .
This is a good omen for the fall .

On the eve of the three - year anniversary of president Bush ’s controversial bankruptcy bill becoming law , data show that in the last two years nearly 1.5 million individuals filed for personal bankruptcy .
The new data further questions the merits of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 .
This coming Sunday marks the third anniversary of President Bush ’s signing of the bankruptcy bill — the largest overhaul to the federal Bankruptcy Code since its enactment in 1978 .
The costs of this legislation to financially stressed Americans are increasingly evident .
Supporters of the bill in 2005 ( including President Bush ) argued that BAPCPA would significantly decrease the number of bankruptcy filings by eliminating those who were declaring “ bankruptcies of convenience . ”
Opponents asserted that BAPCPA would only lower the number of bankruptcy filers in the short term as the increased costs and complexity of filing for bankruptcy under the new law would cause financially struggling families to delay filing .
The opponents of the bill proved to be prescient .
After a sharp increase in the number of bankruptcy filings leading up to October 17 , 2005 ( the date the new law took effect ) , followed by a dramatic drop immediately following this deadline , filing rates have continued to climb .
And if data since enactment of BAPCPA is any guide , including numbers released earlier this week by the U.S. Courts , subsequent releases in 2008 and beyond , will likely highlight the continuance of this upward trend .
This continued upward trend should n’t really be all that surprising , given that more and more people are losing their jobs and their benefits while still mired in record amounts of debt .
By the end of the fourth quarter of 2007 , the national Chapter 7 bankruptcy rate had reached 1.7 filings per 1,000 people , which is a 95.8 percent increase from the 0.9 filings per 1,000 people at the end of the first quarter of 2006 , the first complete quarter after BAPCPA took effect .
Similarly , the national Chapter 13 bankruptcy rate stood at 1.1 filings per 1,000 people in the fourth quarter of 2007 , a 62.2 percent increase from 0.7 filings per 1,000 people in the first quarter of 2006 .
BAPCPA made it harder for consumers to prove that they should be allowed the “ fresh start ” of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy , in which a debtor ’s assets are liquidated and distributed among creditors — with most of a debtor ’s remaining debts cancelled , thus giving the debtor a “ fresh start . ”
Instead , in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy , debtors are put on a repayment plan that lasts up to five years , and only after this time has past are most of the remaining debts canceled .
BAPCPA ’s amendments meant that many more filers fell under Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7 .
The amendments to the bankruptcy code included :
Mandatory credit counseling session prior to filing for bankruptcy , and money management classes at the expense of the debtor
More stringent means tests to determine which type of bankruptcy a debtor qualifies for — one based on the median income of the state in which a debtor files for bankruptcy , and the other on the debtor ’s ability to pay at least 25 percent of his unsecured debt
Additional required documents that make the case subject to automatic dismissal if not produced , including a statement of monthly income and any anticipated increases in both income and expenses after filing , tax returns filed during their case ( including those for years that may have not been filed when their case began ) , and a picture ID
Tougher homestead exemptions that affect the amount of home equity a debtor can protect from creditors
Increased bankruptcy attorney liability , which has led to increased lawyers ’ fees
So why are we now seeing an increase in the number of families going through the more expensive and complicated bankruptcy filing process ?
Research shows that families are often forced to file for bankruptcy following an unfortunate unplanned event from which they are unable to bounce back because of other financial factors , such as low income and savings levels .
The research points to the relationship between bankruptcy and unemployment , low income , debt levels — especially credit card debt — and medical expenditures , particularly for those families who lack health insurance , as the real reasons why people file for bankruptcy .
1
All of these factors have been going in the wrong direction for the past two years as the economy began to slow in the wake of a bursting housing bubble .
A glance at several leading economic indicators proves that families have indeed been confronted with mounting financial challenges , which increase the pressures confronting a family regardless of BAPCPA ’s amendments to the bankruptcy code .
Consider first the job market , which has become increasingly bleak .
Since the beginning of the year , the U.S. economy has lost a total of 232,000 jobs through the end of March 2008 .
Since March 2007 , the U.S. economy has only gained an average of 44,770 jobs per month , which is markedly lower than the average monthly job growth of 138,600 jobs in the previous 12 months , and the 236,900 jobs in the 12 months before that .
Wage growth has been equally unimpressive , with stagnant wage growth plaguing workers throughout the current business cycle , which began in March 2001 .
Hourly wages were only 2.3 percent higher in February 2008 ( the last month for which complete data were available ) than in March 2001 , after factoring in inflation .
Real weekly wages grew by only 1.1 percent over the same period .
Then there ’s growing family debt , which has reached record highs .
Household debt averaged a record 133.7 percent of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2007 , the last period for which complete data were available .
Families spent 14.3 percent of their disposable income to service their debt in that same period .
The reasons for rising family debt levels include , among slower income growth , the decline in employer - provided health insurance alongside the rising costs of basic necessities .
The share of private sector workers with employer - provided health insurance dropped to 59.7 percent in 2006 — the last year for which complete data were available — from 64.2 percent in 2000 , leaving more workers to cope with financially debilitating medical emergencies on their own .
On top of this , families are paying more for transportation , the cost of which was up 9.5 percent in January 2008 from a year earlier , college tuition ( up 6.2 percent ) , fuel and utilities ( up 5.6 percent ) , medical care ( up 4.5 percent ) , and food ( up 4.6 percent ) .
Since March 2001 , food prices rose by 21.6 percent , fuels and utilities by 36.3 percent , medical care by 34.1 percent , transportation by 26.1 percent , and college tuition by 63.5 percent .
Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings have continued to increase since the passage of BAPCPA because families who had deferred filing due to the increased costs and complexity of the process are increasingly being forced to file due to financial factors that are at least somewhat out of their control .
What ’s worse , bankruptcy rates will likely continue to rise , especially as families confront even higher financial pressures amid the current economic slowdown .
If Congress wants to get serious about reducing the number of families faced with the financial hardships that accompany bankruptcy , they must recognize that larger macroeconomic issues are at play and enact policies that help alleviate potential financial hardships from hurting families ’ economic stability .
Policy solutions that help alleviate potential financial hardships from hurting families economic stability , such as those that call for better health care coverage , support higher income growth for low and middle - income earners , and encourage the growth of good jobs , would likely do more to lessen the bankruptcy rate than BAPCPA .

Squeak on the iPhone !
11 June , 2008
John M McIntosh announced on the squeak - dev mailing list that “ I ’m pleased to say that I ’m one of the 1.5 % of the iPhone developer population that has been accepted to officially build applications for distribution via Apple ’s iPhone Application Store . ”
He ’s prepared a 93 - day plan to build a new fully documented Objective C based source tree to host the Squeak VM on the iPhone and in addition as a 64 bit VM on OS -X .
He ’s already collaborating with Impara who are looking at adapting the Squeak UI to the iPhone ’s multi - touch paradigm and platform widgets , and is looking for further support ( and funding ) for this work .
John is also looking to offer support for Squeak developers hoping to make their applications available through the iPhone Store , although he notes that Apple has a number of restrictions limiting the types of applications that can be made available in this way .
The screenshot above shows a “ visually exciting ” 3.4 image running on an iPod Touch , the result of 15 days ’ work .
John does sound a note of caution : the VM is currently running at a speed equivalent to a 233 Mhz 603e PowerBook , and 64MB of memory use is pushing the Apple ’s imposed safety limits right to the max , so developers may have to relearn all those optimisation techniques they may have forgotten in recent years !
I can remember being very young , about 4 or 5 I imagine , and taking a shower in my mother 's house .
I was showering alone at the time and I remember realizing I had to defecate .
Instantly I thought through it with as much of my young logic as I could muster up .
" Where am I supposed to poop ? "
" The bathroom ! "
" Are we in the bathroom ? "
" Yes ! "
A few minutes later my mother came in and , judging from her facial expression , ( which is still stuck firmly in my mind ) , she could n't understand why I was so proud to have worked through one of my first logic problems .
This story is NOT an example socialization destroying the beauty of a child .
This story is of a silly thing a child did and a mother 's understanding reaction to it .
There are a few fairly logical reasons not to shit in your bathtub , especially when there is a toilet far better equipped for such things only a meter away .
There are some things that socialization is good for .
Teaching children the difference between a toilet and a bathtub qualifies as pretty harmless for me .
Language ( barring some strong , often offensive language ) is pretty harmless .
My parents spoke a language , they taught it to me and now I can communicate .
Works for me .
These examples are in the minority by far , though .
My parents also designed my diet for me .
Though they did n't necesarily feed me on a steady diet of McDonald 's horrors , they did introduce meat to me as a child .
I am a vegetarian now .
Everyone probably has a handfull of issues that they wish they could bring back to their parents in a time machine .
Just zap yourself back in time and leave a little essay on your kitchen fridge ; ' Perhaps meat is n't right for your child ' , would have been the title of mine .
Other people might have essay titles like " Your son will never like football , deal with it " , " If you keep saying nigger , your kid is going to grow up saying it too " , and maybe " please stop smoking around your infant " .
Mine would have been about the meat though .
Generations go by without people thinking about why they do the things they do .
Children keep getting born into this system and are given low - context answers to all of their important questions .
A child keeps asking why and eventually gets told to shut up .
Not " I do n't know son , let 's find out why the sky is blue " , but " shut up kid , it 's not important " .
Every day the beautiful curiousity of a child gets crushed by a parent who just does n't have the answers and does n't have that same curiosity in them to search for the answers .
What 's the solution to this problem ?
Learn from your children .
Do n't try to teach them everything , but observe their curiosity , their uncorrupted search for new things , their hateless , greedless , fearless perspective on everything .
I do n't have to tell any mothers out there though , it 's important to monitor the fearlessness .
That can cause serious problems that I sometimes do n't want to think about at the same time that I think about a child 's beauty .
Learn from your children .
They are pure and uncorrupted by the world , right up until the point that you corrupt them or let some outside force get at them .
Television comes to mind there .....
You are socialized , they are not .
It 's important to remember this and respect that .
Teach them what they need , but be sure that they need it .
Allow that curiosity to grow and maybe they 'll take you on a curious adventure to discover why the world is the way it is .
I assure you that if you do this you will engender a trust between you and your child that will be amazing .
Your child will look at you as the person who will know everything , no matter what , just because you are their parent .
Imagine really introducing your children to those answers to their questions .
Imagine justifying that trust they put in you .
Imagine being the person who really did know everything for their kids .
You do n't actually have to know everything , just be willing to find out , even if it takes a little curiosity and a sense of adventure .

Protests about the housing situation are becoming common in Paris
It took six months for Liberation journalist Ondine Millot to get to the truth about the most sordid side of France 's housing crisis .
Look through some property websites and you can see the advertisements : the phrase you are looking for is contre services - when a room in an apartment is offered , sometimes " free " , in exchange for services .
Sometimes the service is perfectly innocent - cleaning the apartment or washing clothes , to defray some of the high cost of renting property .
But sometimes it is not : instead the requests are sexual , demeaning , bordering on the perverse .
" Sex twice a month , " is one blunt demand .
Another asks for someone " open in spirit and elsewhere " .
" Flat in exchange for libertine services , " goes another .
Property - for - sex Ondine Millot - who in her day job is the court correspondent for the French daily paper - spent six months researching these advertisements and the people who place them , for an article which exposed the trade in property - for - sex .
Most of the ads ... where no amount was specified for the rent , were men that were looking for sex in exchange for housing .
Ondine Millot , Liberation journalist " I was very surprised to find out that this kind of thing was going on , " she says .
" We called a lot of men , I made something like 50 phone calls .
Most of the ads that were ' against services ' , where no amount was specified for the rent , were men that were looking for sex in exchange for housing . "
But the problem is not just hidden away on websites .
Take a quick look through the bookshelves of any decent - sized newsagent , and tucked between the biographies of the former French First Lady and the former American First Lady is the extraordinary account of Laura D. Her book , My Dear Studies ( Mes Cheres Etudes ) , details the anonymous young woman 's slide from being a fresh - faced undergraduate , to a poverty - stricken student , to a 19 - year - old selling her body to pay the rent .
Laura
D's book has exposed the situation facing the young " Laura " , when I meet her at her publisher 's , is charming , if desperately concerned to keep her identity secret , to spare her parents the horror of knowing how their daughter fell .
But she is also angry .
It was , she says , the astronomical cost of property that sent her on to the streets .
" Rent was over 70 % of my budget , " she says .
" Looking at friends , people I know , they live in places that are unhealthy , squalid .
Or they negotiate with landlords who rent them rooms and who sometimes abuse them . "
Housing Crisis
Sex for rent is the extreme end of an extreme problem which is catching swathes of France 's most vulnerable people - the young and the poor - in its grip .
France , the government admits , is in the grip of its worst housing crisis since the end of World War II .
Of course , sky - high property prices are hardly exclusive to France .
But some combination of circumstances has left the French - and especially the Parisian - rental market horribly stretched between supply and demand .
And too many people caught between homelessness and bankruptcy as they struggle to put a roof over their heads .
There are a far higher proportion of properties empty in Paris than in London .
As the number sleeping rough has declined in the British capital , it has climbed in the French capital .
In Britain the norm is owner - occupation .
While in France rental is seen as the way to live .
Protests The French Republic was built on street protest .
So , unsurprisingly , a new generation of housing protest groups have sprung up to campaign in innovative ways .
Groups such as Jeudi Noir , Droit au Logement and Les Enfants de Don Quichote have grabbed publicity - and , they say , won political concessions - through their protests .
The Ministry of Housing Crisis ... a former bank in the centre of Paris Jeudi Noir is the guerrilla wing of the movement , conducting sting operations on landlords looking for something extra on the side .
They also view and film tiny apartments being advertised for extortionate rents .
Les Enfants de Don Quichote left the French government twisting with embarrassment with a mass sleep out in Paris last year , as hundreds of activists and homeless people slept in tents by the Seine .
Droit au Logement , alongside Jeudi Noir , has occupied a former bank right opposite the old Paris stock exchange , just down the road from the Bank of France .
It has rechristened the building The Ministry of Housing Crisis , and uses it as both an operational base and a squat .
The groups ' actions keep the issue in the public eye .
They know that great stunts are not going to get the million homes that France needs built .
But they also believe that unless the pressure is kept up on politicians local and national , then change will never come .
Christine Boutin , the French Housing Minister , has acknowledged the efforts of the campaign groups and has begun looking at ways to improve the conditions of the rental market .
Crossing Continents on BBC Radio 4 reports on the housing situation in France on Thursday , 13 March at 1100 GMT .

What are these ?
It took Linda Medlock four years and $ 8,000 to pay off the $ 500 she borrowed from a payday lender to make her mortgage payment .
“ I still believe that they are the new loan sharks of the 21st century , ” she said .
Stories of quick cash and high interest rates like Medlock ’s are driving legislation at the Capitol this year to sock it to “ predatory lenders . ”
“ Not even the mob can charge as high of interest rates , ” said Rep. Mark Ferrandino , a Denver Democrat who announced a bill Thursday that would muzzle the industry .
“ This legislation will help hardworking men and women in Colorado who are living paycheck to paycheck . ”
In what they say is the toughest crackdown on payday lenders in the nation , lawmakers want to cap the annual interest rate on payday loans at 36 percent and prohibit lenders from giving people with unpaid loans more money .
Lenders would have to check a database to see whether customers are already in debt .
A trade association said the “ payday lending reform act ” is so strict , hundreds of lenders in Colorado could go out of business if it becomes law .
Lawmakers said the average payday loan in Colorado is $ 343 , with average finance fees of $ 544 .
Lenders can charge $ 60 for a $ 300 loan for two weeks .
The average annual interest rate for a loan in Colorado is 350 percent .
Senate President Peter Groff said that in his north Denver district , there are a disproportionate amount of payday lenders — especially in low - income neighborhoods .
“ Many Coloradans are caught in this debt trap , ” Groff said .
“ It ’s time these outfits stopped enriching themselves on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens . ”
Capping the annual interest rate at 36 percent is unfair because payday loans are typically for two weeks , not a year , said Lyndsey Medsker , spokeswoman for Community Financial Services Association , whose members operate about 180 stores in Colorado .
“ That ’s effectively a ban on the industry , ” she said .
“ If you apply an annual rate to a two - week loan , it just does n’t work . ”
Under current law , payday lenders can charge about $ 17 to lend $ 100 for two weeks , she said .
The proposed legislation would drop that to $ 1.38 .
“ They would lose money , ” Medsker said .
She also disagreed that lenders should turn away customers with unpaid loans .
Their only options then are to not pay their bill and get a late fee , bounce a check or borrow from a friend or family member , Medsker said .
Since 2003 , payday loans in Colorado have increased 117 percent .
More than 70 percent of short - term loans went to borrowers with at least 11 loans in the previous year .

When I began researching how the American academic community responded to the Nazi persecution of the Jews in the 1930s , I expected to find some troubling episodes .
But what I discovered is far more disturbing than I ever anticipated .
At a Boston University conference this week , sponsored by the David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies , I described some of my research findings , especially those pertaining to Harvard University .
The Harvard University administration during the 1930s , led by President James Conant , ignored numerous opportunities to take a principled stand against the Hitler regime and the antisemitic outrages it perpetrated , and contributed to Nazi Germany ’s efforts to improve its image in the West .
The administration ’s lack of concern about Nazi antisemitism was shared by many influential Harvard alumni and students .
A faculty panel that supervised a mock trial of Hitler in 1934 ruled that Hitler ’s anti-Jewish actions were “ irrelevant ” to the debate .
Nazi leaders were warmly welcomed to the Harvard campus and invited to prestigious social events , as the Harvard administration strove to build friendly relations with thoroughly Nazified universities in Germany .
By doing so , Harvard ’s administration and many of its student leaders offered important encouragement to the Hitler regime as it intensified its persecution of the Jews and strengthened its armed forces .
President Conant ’s insistence on treating Nazi academics as part of the “ learned world , ” and his reluctance to offer faculty positions to prominent Jewish refugee scholars , was shaped in part by his own antisemitic prejudices .
When the DuPont corporation sought his advice about hiring a German Jewish scientist who had fled the Nazis , Conant urged it not to employ him , noting that he was “ very definitely of the Jewish type–very heavy . ”
The scientist they rejected , Max Bergmann , was described by the New York Times as “ one of the leading organic chemists in the world . ”
Prominent Harvard alumni , student leaders , and some faculty assumed a major role in the friendly welcome accorded the Nazi warship Karlsruhe when it visited Boston in 1934 , flying the swastika flag .
Boston ’s Jewish community protested vociferously .
President Conant remained silent .
Officers and crewmen from the warship were entertained at Harvard , and professors attended a gala reception in Boston where the warship ’s captain enthusiastically praised Hitler .
That year , the Harvard administration welcomed a top Nazi official , Ernst Hanfstangl , who was Hitler ’s foreign press chief as well as a virulent antisemite , to the campus for his 25th class reunion .
The student newspaper , the Harvard Crimson , editorialized that the university should award Hanfstangl an honorary degree “ as a mark of honor appropriate to his high position in the government of a friendly country . ”
The joyous reception Hanfstangl received on campus was interrupted when a local rabbi confronted him and demanded to know what Hanfstangl had meant when he recently remarked that “ everything would soon be settled for the Jews in Germany . ”
The rabbi cried out , “ My people want to know . . . does it mean extermination ? ”
Hanfstangl replied that he “ [ could ] not discuss that .
I am on vacation .
I am with my old friends . ”
The Nazi official proceeded to President Conant ’s house for tea .
Anti-Nazi activists opposed Hanfstangl ’s visit .
Some put up posters in Harvard Yard , only to have the Harvard police tear them down .
Others held a rally in Harvard Square .
Seven demonstrators who tried to speak at the rally were arrested , and sentenced to six months at hard labor .
Conant called the demonstration “ very ridiculous . ”
Several months later , the Harvard administration permitted the Nazi German consul - general to lay a wreath bearing the swastika in the university ’s chapel , beneath a tablet honoring Harvard men killed fighting for Germany in World War I .
During the next several years , Harvard participated in academic student exchanges with Nazi universities .
In 1936 Harvard contributed significantly to Nazi Germany ’s effort to gain international respectability by accepting Heidelberg University ’s invitation to send a delegate to its 550th anniversary festival .
Heidelberg had expelled its Jewish professors , reshaped its curricula to reflect Nazi ideology , and staged a massive public burning of books by Jews .
The Germans had exploited the recently concluded Winter Olympics in Bavaria to extol Nazism .
It should have been obvious they would do the same at Heidelberg .
American newspapers described the Heidelberg festival as a “ brown - shirt pageant ” in which Nazi leaders delivered antisemitic harangues .
Moreover , Conant did not sign a petition that some American educators circulated in 1937 when Polish universities required segregated seating for Jewish students .
Poland ’s Jews considered this a major step toward ghettoization in all areas of life , and appealed to Western educators to denounce it .
It is shameful that the leaders of America ’s most prestigious university remained indifferent to Germany ’s terrorist campaign against the Jews in the critical years leading up the Holocaust , and on many occasions even assisted the Nazis ’ efforts to improve their public image in the West .

David Hasselhoff's New Show ' Viva Hoff Vegas '
Actor and singerhas had his share of public humiliation in the past and now his plan is to bring his crazy life to Las Vegas .
Can anyone forget that drunken cheeseburger rant ?
Last year David took the stage in Paris and starred in The Producers and now he wants to bring his own show to Vegas and call it Viva Hoff Vegas .
Discussing the new project , David said :
It 's a fun act , I had a ball in Vegas ... and I think Vegas wants to see The Hoff , so I 'm putting together a knock - down , drag - out , crazy , make - fun - of - my - life Hoff show . "
No word on whether estranged ex-wife will be in the show .
The couple had a messy split after 16 years of marriage - so there is undoubtedly some great material to be had here .
If you have not seen the video that was taken a year ago by Hoff 's daughter , it shows the actor falling down drunk and definitely off the wagon , ranting while eating a cheeseburger .
It is one of his less impressive moments .
Check it out below if you have the stomach for such things .
A nursing home in Germany built an exact replica of a bus stop in front of the facility .
The only difference is that buses never stop there .
" It sounds funny , " said Old Lions Chairman Franz - Josef Goebel , " but it helps .
Our members are 84 years - old on average .
Their short - term memory hardly works at all , but the long - term memory is still active .
They know the green and yellow bus sign and remember that waiting there means they will go home . "
The result is that errant patients now wait for their trip home at the bus stop , before quickly forgetting why they were there in the first place .
" We will approach them and say that the bus is coming later today and invite them in to the home for a coffee , " said Mr Neureither .
" Five minutes later they have completely forgotten they wanted to leave . "

The editorial board of the Lexington Herald - Leader endorsed Barack Obama today , just days short of Kentucky ’s Democratic primary .
“ The opportunity for national renewal will be even greater if , as appears almost certain , Sen. Barack Obama is the nominee , ” the paper said in its endorsement .
The paper touched on the fact that Obama has tapped into a widespread yearning for change in the nation ’s politics , “ Obama has given voice to a widespread yearning not just for a changing of the guard but for a changing of the game .
And that ability to express a people ’s aspirations is a mark of leadership .
Like President John F. Kennedy , another senator who electrified young people , Obama also has the substance to transform idealism into action . ”
They took the Kennedy comparison a little further and touched on Kennedy ’s religion and Obama ’s race , “ its worth remembering that Kennedy ’s Catholicism seemed as large an obstacle to popular acceptance in 1960 as Obama ’s biracialism today .
Our endorsement of Obama is also a statement of our faith in the electorate to look deeper than skin tone . ”

The editors pointed out that Obama needs to do better with voters who have supported Clinton , “ This primary campaign has revealed a gap in his support , one that will be evident in Kentucky on Tuesday , as lower - income , less - educated , older and rural white voters line up behind Clinton .
Obama needs to better connect with these voters and learn about their concerns , if not to win , then to govern in the unifying way that he has promised . ”
This was one of the deeper more thought through endorsements that I have read this year .
They acknowledged that Obama is n’t perfect , but he seems to be the right person at the right time for nation .
America needs a real leader , and of the three remaining presidential candidates , Obama is the only one that has shown true leadership .

Current encryption methods are far from perfect — a fact highlighted by the numerous data security breaches that have occurred over the past few years .
Technological limitations in the " trusted server " model for encryption and psychological barriers hinder the robust protection of data .
A trio of computer science researchers has set out to simplify encryption systems .
Their research , which began in 2005 , has led to a novel encryption system that they term " functional encryption " greatly simplifies the problem of key complexity .
In a functional encryption system , keys are personalized and only one is needed for a person to gain access to all the data that should be available to them .
In addition to simplifying the key process , this idea allows users — with proper access rights — to search encrypted volumes for specific information .
The problems with trusted servers
According to Prof. Amit Sahai , there are issues with the current model of storing encrypted data on a " trusted server . "
In this scheme , data is uploaded to a server and that server is given the task of determining who has access to it .
These servers represent a technological problem because they are a tempting target for malcontents who are eager to get their hands on the data .
As the data needed to be stored grows in size , organizations often add more servers to handle it and add redundant backup servers in case one fails .
As the number of servers increases , the number of targets for hackers increases as well .
Beyond the physical problems , psychological issues exist — how many users simply run everything as an administrator or superuser ?
Working in this mode can nullify any encryption or security protocols that may be in place .
I spoke with Prof. Sahai about his work , and he likened current encryption systems to a simple lock and key approach .
Data is kept locked away on a server , and everyone who needs access is given a copy of the same key .
He and his colleagues sought to make encryption both more robust and simpler than current schemes .
The idea behind their work is that a personal key is more than just a key : it holds a person 's information and policies that will mathematically determine what locks they should be allowed to open .
It is this new type of decryption key that is — pardon the pun — the key idea behind this work
Two levels of protection
The researchers ' scheme requires two things to be protected : actual data and the policy for the data .
The policy is essentially an embedded description of who can have access to encrypted data .
While we know how to secure the data , how should the policy be secured ?
According to Prof. Sahai , ideally both should have equal levels of security .
As he put it , the person " who satisfies the policy should only know that they satisfy the policy , " not why .
If one can protect both the policy and the data , then a whole new range of applications is possible .
One such application is searching encrypted data .
Prof. Sahai and colleagues presented their latest work on a new scheme that allows for expressive searching of encrypted data at Eurocyrpt 2008 , a premier international cryptography conference .
A preprint — for the mathematically inclined — of the paper can be obtained from the Cryptology ePrint Archive .
In prior work on searching encrypted data , searchers could use search predicates that consisted only of equality matches and conjunctions .
For example , if have have all of my e-mail encrypted on a remote server , I could search for e-mails where ( sender=Mom ) AND ( month=February ) .
Previous work was unable to handle disjunctions — OR operators .
Using the prior example , previously , I would have been unable to search my encrypted archive for ( sender=Mom ) OR ( sender =Dad ) AND ( month=February ) .
In the above paper , Sahai and coworkers developed a new mathematical formalism for the creation of keys and encryption that allows full searches of encrypted data in both conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms .
In addition to the ability to search encrypted data , the new encryption scheme allows for the implementation of a " fuzzy " identity encryption scheme .
In an identity based encryption scheme , the public key is something tied to your identity — your name , your e-mail , or , in the example Prof .
Sahai relayed to me , your fingerprint .
In their new system , this public key holds not only your identity but the policies about the data that you can have access to .
In the fingerprint example , suppose you encrypt your information under a given impression of your fingerprint .
At a later date you attempt to decrypt the information with you fingerprint , but small changes — dust , scratches , growth — will cause the key ( your fingerprint ) to be slightly different .
The new formalism developed here allows for a " fuzzy " check , so the key can be off within a specified threshold .
One concept that was not clear to me after reading the paper was how such a system would be implemented in the real world .
Prof.
Sahai said that the initial setup would be handled by the organization or person overseeing the data .
They would develop the secret keys and publish public parameters .
With these in place , it is all up to the end users , as they will set the policies of who can see and decrypt their data — all of which is handled by the underlying mathematics .
If a given secret key matches a user 's policy , then the person with that key will be granted access to the encrypted data .
While the underlying math and theory is very complicated , this new scheme greatly advances the encryption and decryption of data while simultaneously allowing a much higher level of control over who can gain access to protected data .
This work is still in the early stages , but the ideas put forth in this line of research have been incorporated in work on an attribute - based messaging system developed by Prof.
Carl Gunter at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champlain .
Co-author Dr. Brent Waters is also scheduled to give the keynote address at a NIST workshop that will occur in early June and focus on " Pairing - based cryptography . "
Even if it 's not keeping up with other types of LCD technology , Westinghouse is at least throwing its support behind a solution for an age old problem .
The budget electronics maker said that it had committed to using a " universal adapter " made by start - up Green Plug that will power everything from cell phones to television sets .

Right now , almost all products ship with a proprietary power adapter .
Green Plug 's technology allows every electronic device to communicate its own energy requirements to one adapter , allowing for several goods to use the same power box .
But in order for the universal adapter to work , companies have to embed Green Plug 's firmware into their electronics .
Westinghouse , the first company to sign on with Green Plug , said the adapter would not only help it cut costs ( it would n't have to sell power adapters with each product if the consumer already has a universal one at home ) , the environmental savings are huge as well .

434 million consumer electronics devices are " retired " in the U.S. each year .
Those products , and their power cords usually end up in landfills .
Meanwhile , over 3 billion power adapters will be shipped worldwide this year .
Imagine how much less that figure would be if everything plugged into a single hub .

Try to be patient in the ER
“ Emergency rooms used to have just curtains between the patients , so they could hear the chaos .
As a result , I think they were a lot more understanding about delays .
Now most hospitals have individual ER rooms that are very isolated .
When patients get upset that it took me 20 minutes to come back to their room , I often wish I could tell them that I was n’t sitting out there doing nothing .
I was comforting someone who just lost a family member . ”

Try your hand at guessing what these weird ER terms mean .
Electricity is a secondary energy source
Electricity is the flow of electrical power or charge .
Electricity is both a basic part of nature and one of the most widely used forms of energy .
The electricity that we use is a secondary energy source because it is produced by converting primary sources of energy such as coal , natural gas , nuclear energy , solar energy , and wind energy , into electrical power .
Electricity is also referred to as an energy carrier , which means it can be converted to other forms of energy such as mechanical energy or heat .
Primary energy sources are renewable or nonrenewable energy , but the electricity we use is neither renewable nor nonrenewable .

Electricity use has dramatically changed daily life
Despite its great importance in daily life , few people probably stop to think about what life would be like without electricity .
Like air and water , people tend to take electricity for granted .
However , people use electricity to do many jobs every day — from lighting , heating , and cooling homes to powering televisions and computers .
Before electricity became widely available , about 100 years ago , candles , whale oil lamps , and kerosene lamps provided light ; iceboxes kept food cold ; and wood - burning or coal - burning stoves provided heat .
Scientists and inventors have worked to decipher the principles of electricity since the 1600s .
Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Edison , and Nikola Tesla made notable contributions to our understanding and use of electricity .
Benjamin Franklin demonstrated that lightning is electricity .
Thomas Edison invented the first long - lasting incandescent light bulb .
Before 1879 , direct current ( DC ) electricity was used in arc lights for outdoor lighting .
In the late 1800s , Nikola Tesla pioneered the generation , transmission , and use of alternating current ( AC ) electricity , which reduced the cost of transmitting electricity over long distances .
Tesla 's inventions brought electricity into homes to power indoor lighting and into factories to power industrial machines .

Gordon Brown has admitted a " bad and disappointing " election for Labour , as the party suffered its worst council results in at least 40 years .
BBC research suggests Labour won 24 % of votes cast in England and Wales , behind the Tories on 44 % and Lib Dems on 25 % .
In total Labour lost 331 councillors and key councils like Reading .
Tory gains include Bury and North Tyneside .
Mr Brown insists his party will learn lessons .
David Cameron called it a " big moment " for the Conservative Party .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said his party had " regained momentum " by gaining 30 councillors despite its projected national share of the vote falling on last year .
General secretary ' quits '
He claimed Labour had lost touch with ordinary people and that Mr Brown had lost his ability to lead .
The margin is similar to the drubbing received by Tory Prime Minister John Major in council elections in 1995 , two years before he was ejected from Downing Street by Tony Blair .
KEY WINS & LOSSES Conservative wins - Basingstoke & Deane , Elmbridge , Southampton , Bury , Harlow , Maidstone , North Tyneside , Nuneaton & Bedworth , Redditch , Rossendale , Solihull , Vale of Glamorgan , West Lindsey , Wyre Forest Conservative losses - Colchester , Coventry Labour wins - Durham , Slough Labour losses - Blaenau Gwent , Caerphilly , Flintshire , Hartlepool , Merthyr Tydfil , Reading , Torfaen , Wolverhampton Liberal Democrats win - Burnley , Kingston - Upon - Hull , Sheffield , St Albans Liberal Democrats lose - West Lindsey , Liverpool , Pendle
Elections latest at - a - glance Johnson ' ahead ' in mayoral race Analysis : Testing times ahead Attention is now focused on the race to be London mayor , where Conservative Boris Johnson is seeking to defeat Labour 's Ken Livingstone .
Counting of the 2.4 m votes began at 0830 BST with a result not now expected before 2400 BST .
With about half of the votes counted , Mr Johnson was ahead in nine out of 14 areas on first preference votes .
London 's Evening Standard newspaper has called it a win for Mr Johnson .
But as election fever gripped Westminster , Labour had further bad news as the party 's newly appointed general secretary , David Pitt - Watson - a City fund manager - decided not to take up the position .
Mr Pitt - Watson , believed to have been Mr Brown 's choice , was appointed after Peter Watt resigned over the row about donations from businessman David Abrahams .
And senior Labour backbencher Ian Gibson said Mr Brown had six months - up to the party conference - to move the party forward or risk losing the next general election .
In the local elections - where results continue to come in - the Tories have had a 4 % higher share of the national vote than in last year 's local polls .
Such a share in a general election would have the potential to give the party a Commons majority of 138 .
Mr Brown told reporters : " It 's clear to me that this has been a disappointing night , indeed a bad night for Labour . "
He conceded that the government had " lessons to learn " , but insisted : " My job is to listen and to lead . "
The test of leadership is not what happens in a period of success but what happens in difficult circumstances
Gordon Brown
Labour loses in Welsh heartlands Cameron hails ' big moment ' Clegg hails Lib Dem showing
He blamed " difficult economic circumstances " for much of the bad performance , and claimed that measures taken by the government to counter problems would become clear " over the next few months " .
" I think people want to be assured , and indeed people are questioning and want to be assured , that the government will steer them through these difficult times . "
He added : " The test of leadership is not what happens in a period of success but what happens in difficult circumstances . "
Mr Cameron said : " This is a very big moment for the Conservative Party - but I do n't want anyone to think that we would deserve to win an election on the back of a failing government .
" I want us to really prove to people that we can make the changes that they want to see , in terms of schools and hospitals and crime and the other issues that really matter to all of us .
" That 's what I 'm going to devote myself and my party to over the next few months . "
' No crisis '
The Tories have gained control of several councils including Southampton , Bury , Harlow , Maidstone and North Tyneside .
BBC analysis suggests Labour 's vote appears to have fallen most heavily in its traditional heartlands - suggesting MPs were right to fear the 10 p tax row had damaged their core support .
RESULTS ROUND -UP
General turnout looks like it will be about 35 % , similar to last year Projected national vote share : Tories 44 % , Lib Dems 25 % , Labour 24 %
Worst share of national vote for Labour in recent history Surprise Tory win in Southampton and solid progress in north Greens and BNP make little progress nationally , UKIP up 1
Tories seize power in Southampton Conservatives celebrate Bury win Analysis : Martha Kearney 's verdict In Wales , Labour lost control of five councils and could also be out of office in another .
Labour was defeated in its south Wales valley heartland areas of Merthyr Tydfil , Blaenau Gwent , Torfaen and Caerphilly .
It also lost Flintshire .
Ministers were trying to put a brave face on the results and pledging to listen to voters ' concerns .
Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme the results had been " very disappointing indeed " , but said the elections had taken place against a background of rising economic concerns .
" We did n't respond early enough to those groups of people who were going to lose out as a result of the change in the 10 p rate which overall benefits lower income people but there were some people who lost out and we did n't react early enough , " she said .
Labour 's chief whip Geoff Hoon said : " There 's no crisis .
This is n't something that 's going to affect the fundamental stability of the government . "
Liberal Democrat leader Mr Clegg told BBC Breakfast : " We were 13 % a few months ago , we 're now 25 % .
We 've over - taken Labour , we 've taken seats off the Conservatives , we 've taken seats off Labour .
" If you call that a disappointment then we inhabit different planets .
I am actually delighted , we are regaining momentum . "
London contest
More than 4,000 seats on 159 councils were up for grabs in Thursday 's elections , as well as the London mayoralty and assembly .
All seats are up for election in the 22 Welsh unitary authorities .
HAVE YOUR SAY I voted for the Conservatives and I 'm glad they won my local election Matt , Bedworth Meanwhile , a BBC opinion poll suggests
Tory leader David Cameron is seen as more effective than Mr Brown or Mr Clegg .
Of 1,005 people who took part in the poll , 68 % said Mr Cameron was an asset to his party , compared with 43 % for Mr Clegg and 42 % for Mr Brown .
Mr Brown 's reputation for economic competence has also taken a blow .
At this time last year 48 % said that Labour could be trusted to run the country 's economy , little different from the 53 % who did so in 2002 .
But this year the figure has fallen to 32 % .
However , only 36 % said they trust the Conservatives to run the economy - 10 points down on last year , and little better than the figure of 32 % recorded for the party in 2002 .

-- For years , it was not clear whether rising prices would ever prompt Americans to use less gasoline .
But a combination of record high prices , the slowing economy and a tight credit market is having an effect .
Gasoline demand has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and is headed for the first annual drop in 17 years , according to U.S. government estimates .
The
Transportation Department reported Friday
that in March , Americans drove 11 billion fewer miles than in March 2007 , a decline of 4.3 % ( see chart above ) .
It is the first time since 1979 that traffic has dropped from one March to the next , and the month - on - month percentage decline is the largest since record keeping began in 1942 .

But 6 years kid .
That 's really what pisses me off the most .
And we 're not talking just any 6 years .
19 - 25 .
Those are my prime fucking years .
Do you know how many times I shot down a sweet , charming , intelligent girl in line at starbucks .
Or shunned the advances of the admittedly moronic but still dam sexy hipster girls at Estelle's .
Oh , and that INCREDIBLE chick who I bought the car from and was nearly floored by the instant chemistry .
Fuck yes , I took note of those situations and countless others .
But the difference between you and I is that I have the character and morality to honor my word and I was faithful .
In 6 years , not once did I so much as even slip .
Where is your character ?
You 're comming up fast on 30 ..... you still drink until you pass out on the weekends .
Your writing has been suffering and quickly sliding down hill for nearly two years now .
You have n't been published in 6 months .
You 're starting to look weathered and rapidly approaching the stereotypical " bar whore " look .
Honestly , I 'm not saying this to hurt you .
Granted I 'm pissed .
I really am .
In my fucking bed ?
Seriously ?
You have your own fucking place ?
What was it , for the thrill ?
And then you have the nerve to call me an animal when I take a few swings at the guy after he threatens me in my own home ?
I bet he did n't seem quite so sexy laying on the floor of my bedroom crying about calling the police while holding his broken nose .
Nice choice in men , gives me a reason to do some self reflection .
And you wonder why I would never fuck you without a condom .... This life you 've chosen .
It 's beyond destructive .
And I feel sorry for you .
I truly hope you get it together one day .
You 're talented , beautiful and deep , deep , deep , deep down ..... somewhat of a decent person .
But as for us .
Not a chance .
So here 's how this is going to work .
I know we 're both strong willed but kid , you know I always end up with the upper hand in life .
1 ) Your " perceived " infiltration into my social circles is hereby null and void .
Because it 's over ( and I mean over ) I can finally say , everyone hated you .
You were rude , obnoxious , pretentious and trendy .
Your intelligence is not an " excuse - all . "
Cutting people down should n't be a hobby .
Do n't call ANYONE , or do the usual " invite yourself " anywhere .
Trust me , they wo n't be calling you .
I 've been hearing for 5 years how I need to leave you .
In fact , we 're having a party tomorrow and I fully plan on getting laid .
If by chance , we stumble into each - other somewhere .... YOU WILL LEAVE , immediately .
2 ) You will Fedex via Priority Overnight , first thing Monday morning , the following : a ) all my LP'sb ) all documents I have saved on your computer ( even though I have copies you plagiarizing bitch ) c ) three shirts , two pairs of jeans , countless socks & boxers - no pervy you can't keem them , d ) my training gloves & heavy bag glovese ) my ipodf ) my ideas notebookg ) any clippings you 've made of my stories or articles ( plagiarizing bitch ) 3 ) the tiffany 's ring - fucking keep it .
I 'd sell it and get a high class whore just to spite you anyway .
4 ) You may no longer speak to any member of my family .
End of story .
I know you and my mom are chummy , not anymore .
she 's getting the same talk .
but in a much nicer way .
5 ) you are barred from the following establishments due to my usual patronage : the uptown barnes and noble , the green mill , danny's , club foot , estelle 's , the lincoln tap and the zebra lounge .
All the other common places are fair game , but please note the last sentence of stipulation # 15 simple things and everything remains copacetic .
and why will you do all these things ?
especially when you 're about the most vindictive and drama craving individual I know .
Because despite all the craziness we were extremely compatible in the bedroom .
And hell , dare I go out on a limb and admit that maybe you were even just a tad kinkier than me ?
No doubt your subconscious recognized the fact that I was the more trustworthy of the two and hence the logic behind myself being the " keeper " of our visual record of our bedroom activities .
thousands of them .
and oddly enough , most of them are of you .
of the two of us , I 'm the one more comfortable with their body , I could give a shit if one of your friends sees my my cock or my ass .
Hell , if I get drunk enough one night , they might just see it anyway .
I know Amy has been bugging you for a threesome for years , something tells me she might just be a phone call away .
But let 's keep this civil .
No need for threats or anything of the sort .
I just want my shit back and never , I MEAN NEVER , to see or hear from you again .
Sound fair ?
6 months from now , if all the above conditions are met within a reasonable time frame you have my word I will delete them all .
And my word ..... well , we both know it 's my bond .
Good luck to you kid .
Hope you get it together .

The proliferation of voluntary carbon offset programs seems like a great way for individuals to help fight climate change .
But do carbon offset programs really work ?
That ’s the question for Bill Stanley , Science Lead for Carbon Strategies , Climate Change Team at The Nature Conservancy .
Lawrence Hamilton , of Charlotte , VT , asks :
“ Are carbon offset programs and forest protection efforts providing real solutions for reducing global carbon emissions ?
And how do these programs help reduce pollution from mercury , arsenic and other “ baddies ” that often accompany carbon emissions ? ”
Bill Stanley , Science Lead for Carbon Strategies , Climate Change Team , replies :
To answer the first question , yes — well - designed carbon offset programs can have a meaningful impact on reducing the carbon emissions that cause climate change .
Deforestation and land - use changes contribute approximately 20 percent of global carbon emissions .
Rigorously - designed , forest - based offset programs can make a real dent in that number .
To be effective , any offset program needs to meet high standards .
These standards include :
Permanence .
The most desirable carbon sequestration projects are those where the restored forests are likely to remain intact indefinitely .
Additionality .
The project should only include activities that would n’t have taken place normally , therefore keeping more carbon dioxide from reaching the atmosphere .
Leakage .
When sequestration at a site leads to land clearing elsewhere , it is referred to as “ leakage . ”
Offset programs should account for and minimize leakage .
Measurement and monitoring .
Periodic field measurements of forest growth and associated capture and storage of carbon are essential .
Standards of verification .
Throughout the life of a project , standards should be maintained and measured to ensure the project meets its intended carbon sequestration goals .
Remember Acid Rain ?
While sequestration projects do not significantly impact pollution from mercury and arsenic , they can indirectly help cut down on these pollutants when implemented as part of an effective cap - and - trade system .
What we need now is a new cap - and - trade system that focuses on carbon emissions , reducing those gases that are causing global warming .
Under such a system , industries are given a hard emissions cap .
Companies that come in below that cap are given credits that they can trade with those who are not able to meet this cap .
A cap - and - trade system is widely credited with drastically reducing factory emissions of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides that cause acid rain .
The same kind of program will work to reduce carbon emissions .
Support a Cap- and - Trade System
The Nature Conservancy strongly believes that credits from forest carbon projects and activities in the United States and in developing countries should be included in a cap - and - trade system .
Including incentives for land conservation and restoration in a cap - and - trade program can help lower the overall compliance costs of such a system , increase support for the program and allow for more aggressive emission reduction goals .
The Conservancy recently began its own voluntary carbon offset program that will help reduce the impacts of climate change and restore critical wildlife habitat .

I need to live the life I want to live , NOW , or I ’ll die living the expectations of my parents , and be crappy job at it because I ’d be miserable .
Many asian parents are amazing at using manipulation , guilt , and self - pity to get their kids to do whatever they want , or at least make them most miserable if the kids disobey .
They are n’t necessarily being malicious on purpose , they just learned it from their parents .
Here is what I have observed from my own experience and coming from a first - generation asian immigrant family :
Ever since I reported on the high suicide rate of Asian American students , I ’ve been thinking of writing something for them that addresses cultural conditioning .

They are n’t necessarily being malicious on purpose , they just learned it from their parents .
I need to live the life I want to live , NOW , or I ’ll die living the expectations of my parents , and do a crappy job at it anyway because I ’d be miserable .
Most families – asian or other – are pretty dysfunctional .
I know I ’m not the only daughter who has ever fallen victim to a mentally unstable mother .
Knowing that I ’m not the person this has ever happened to makes me feel less alone and more optimistic about overcoming these mental and emotional obstacles I ’ve built over the years .
I get depressed because I turn anger inwards , on myself , instead of expressing anger and setting boundaries .
The harder I resist and try to change who my parents are , the harder I fail , because I ca n’t change my parents to get them to love me the way I want them to love me .
I have learned to count my blessings and appreciate friends and my spouse for loving me the way that I want to be loved .
Up until a few years ago , I would get into fights with my mother whenever she starts to “ talk trash . ”
What I mean by “ talking trash ” is making condescending statements or saying things to elicit guilt in other people or being very negative or wallowing in self - pity .
She knows how to push my buttons , and I let her push my buttons .
One afternoon we were speaking on the telephone , and my mother started talking trash .
She made comments like she should n’t have brought us to the US , and how we do n’t behave like caring children because we never visited , and how her friends ’ children treated their mothers so well compared with how we treated her , and if she died we probably would n’t care one iota .
Sound familiar ?
Normally , my brain would pick up the signal to pick a fight and try to prove to her that she was wrong and that she should look at her own behaviors and that we were good kids .
For some reason I got sick of resisting that day , and something else came out of my mouth .
I started agreeing with her .
I agreed that she should n’t have brought us to America .
I agreed that we were crappy kids .
I agreed that she was all alone and being ignored .
I agreed that we might as well have come out from a rock .
I agreed with whatever she was complaining about , and I offered no solution or reconciliation or amends whatsoever .
And she grew quiet and we ended the conversation rather well because we had no argument .
The toughest part about this technique is working with my ego to swallow the insults and offer no resistance and agreeing with something I did n’t agree with .
But with practice , my ego got over it and my mother ’s manipulation loosened its grip on my sanity .
The strange thing is that our relationship has actually improved since I stopped resisting , even when I have offered her no behavioral changes on my part .
I ’m not going to lie and say that my emotionally and mental well - being has completely recovered from the different things I had endured with my mother when I was a little girl .
To this day I still work on my mental conditioning and internal messages on a daily basis – so we ’re talking about 30 + years and counting .
But each day , I get a little better and I unlearn a little bit of the cruel messages I had learned to believe about who I am .
And it can get better for you too .
Related … ( and a 2011 update ) – This post is , in many ways , part of a long journey of me writing a book that I ’ve wanted to write for 9 years but was n’t ready to write it or knew who I was writing it for .

Wexler continued , “ The Articles present a stunning narrative of offenses that go well beyond previous crimes committed by any U.S. chief executive .
In fact , no President or Vice President in history has done more to undermine our constitution . ”
Congressman Wexler serves on the House Judiciary Committee .
Wexler also announced that Judiciary Committee Chairman Conyers had met his call to have Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan testify under oath .
Wexler also announced on Tuesday that McClellan has agreed to testify , under oath , on June 20th at 10 a.m .
Wexler notes , “ This will be the first step in what we hope will be ongoing and deepening examinations of the stark evidence and charges against both President Bush and Vice President Cheney . ”
" It 's great to celebrate the things we love about our country .

“ The strongest pro-majority campaign in the nation is mounting here with far - reaching implications .

“ Johnson , 34 , seeking the post vacated by now - Secretary of Defense Richard Chaney [ sic ] , is a smart Harvard - law grad who persuasively articulates the pro-gun , pro-family , pro-American position .
He is a dedicated anti-communist with many youthful supporters . ”
If you ever just pick a judicial candidate randomly at the polling place -- I mean who really knows one from the other , right -- I hope that after you read this , you 'll never do it again .
On page 7 of the Los Angeles " Official Sample Ballot " for next Tuesday 's primary is a race for Judge of the Superior Court ( Office number 125 ) .
The contest has n't gotten any publicity .
But I want you to read this :
The man who wrote that -- a proposed constitutional amendment -- is asking for our votes for the Superior Court .
His name -- well he has many names -- is Bill Johnson .
He also goes by the names William Daniel Johnson , Daniel Johnson and James O. Pace .
He 's an attorney , a Mormon , and , as you may have concluded , a white supremacist ( and Ron Paulista ) .
The paragraph comes from his 1985 book , in which he urges the repeal of the 14th ( which defines citizenship as well as due process and equal protection under the law ) and 15th ( which guarantees voting rights for all citizens ) Amendments .
He advocates deporting tens of millions of Americans within one year .
That would include ... well , read his little amendment again .
American Indians , Eskimos , Hawaiians wo n't be citizens but they 'll have to live on reservations .
This is n't Johnson 's first bid for elective office .
When Dick Cheney resigned from Congress to become Secretary of Defense in 1989 , Johnson ran for his House seat in Wyoming .
He did n't win although a GOP front group publication , , strongly backed him .
One of those " youthful supporters " was his 18 year old campaign manager / KKK organizer , John Abarr .
Johnson kind of sounds like a typical , garden variety Republican child molester .
In fact , he also ran for Congress in Arizona in 2006 , trying to sneak into the Democratic primary .
Like Joe Lieberman and Zell Miller , he claimed to be a " traditional Democrat " who was abandoned by the Democratic Party .
Blue Dog Gabby Giffords won the primary with 54.1 % of the vote .
Johnson managed to get 3.0 % .
Giffords went on to beat Randy Graf , a Republican extremist with similar views to Johnson's .
Aside from being active in Ron Paul 's campaign , he is also a Minuteman activist and exactly the kind of person made to feel empowered by CNN resident xenophobe Lou Dobbs .
Johnson 's campaign manager , Holly Clearman is also state coordinator for the Ron Paul for President campaign and is herself is a candidate for the Republican L.A. County Central Committee .
They are counting on Paulistas to put him over the top .
Fortunately , there are legal community newspapers that actually do the research on judicial candidates .
In L.A. we have the Metropolitan News Enterprise , which dug up a lot of the facts on Johnson 's multiple identities .
I hope all the little zombies find out before Tuesday !

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Florida ’s tomato industry is in “ complete collapse ” and growers in California and Mexico are having trouble selling their crops as U.S. regulators hunt the source of a salmonella outbreak linked to certain tomato varieties , growers said on Tuesday .

Florida 's tomato industry is in " complete collapse " and $ 40 million worth of tomatoes will rot unless federal regulators quickly trace the source of a salmonella outbreak and clear the state 's produce , an industry official said on Tuesday .

In Florida , the No. 1 U.S. tomato producer , $ 40 million worth of tomatoes will rot unless the U.S. Food and Drug Administration quickly traces the source of the outbreak and clears the state ’s produce , an industry official said .
“ We ’ve had to stop packing , stop picking , ” said Reggie Brown , executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange .
“ The stuff that should have been harvested over the weekend wo n’t survive more than another day or so .
The stuff we have in storage is getting riper every minute and at some point it will have to be disposed of , ” Brown said .
The FDA warned U.S. consumers on Saturday that the outbreak was linked to eating certain raw red plum , red Roma , and red round tomatoes , and products containing those tomatoes .
Major restaurant and grocery chains stopped selling those varieties , and some stopped selling all raw tomatoes entirely .
U.S. growers produced $ 1.28 billion worth of tomatoes last year , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Florida produces an annual crop valued at $ 500 million to $ 700 million , and supplies more than 90 percent of the nation ’s tomatoes this time of year , Brown said .
The FDA has said that it is safe to eat cherry tomatoes , grape tomatoes and tomatoes sold with the vine still attached but those account for only a tiny portion of the industry .
The FDA has said it does not know where the contaminated tomatoes originated .
The infections have struck most often in New Mexico and Texas .
The FDA has put California on the list of suppliers not linked to the outbreak .
But some supermarkets still rejected tomatoes from that state , which is the No. 2 U.S. producer with $ 400 million in annual sales .
“ The reality is that the entire tomato industry is being impacted , ” said Ed Beckman , president of the California Tomato Farmers .
“ It was n’t really clear that round and Romas from California are safe to eat .
That ’s part of the problem . ”
The FDA said there had been 167 reported cases as of Tuesday , including at least 23 hospitalizations , related to the outbreak since mid-April .
The infections were caused by Salmonella Saintpaul , an uncommon type of the bacteria .
Salmonella bacteria are frequently responsible for food - borne illnesses .
Symptoms generally appear within 12 to 72 hours after eating infected food and include fever , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain .
With the tainted spinach scare of 2006 still fresh in their minds , buyers and consumers were unwilling to take chances , growers said .
Three people died and more than 200 were sickened by eating spinach contaminated with E. coli bacteria .
Mexican growers , who produce 84 percent of the tomatoes imported by the United States , were also feeling the pain .
“ U.S. consumers have started to reject orders that have already been promised or sent and it is causing a lot of damage to producers , ” said Mario Robles , who directs the investigation arm of the vegetable association in the state of Sinaloa .
Mexico sends nearly 700,000 metric tons of tomatoes a year to the United States in a business worth $ 900 million , according to a Mexican vegetable exporters association .
Exports of Mexican agricultural products soared after the United States , Canada and Mexico lifted all tariff barriers under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement .
But the benefits can easily be wiped out by a sanitary scare like the one in 2000 , when the FDA identified a strain of salmonella in Mexican melons and banned their import .
That cut the $ 200 million annual export business down to around $ 3 million , said Robles , and Mexican growers fear the same could happen to tomatoes .
The scientific study of evolution is filled with controversies .
That was one of the messages coming out of a two - day symposium on the latest in research from the field that was hosted by Rockefeller University last week .
I 'll discuss the scientific details of some of the talks separately , but it 's worth analyzing these controversies in light of the " academic freedom " bills that are being considered by a number of states , which purport to protect teachers who discuss controversies regarding evolution .
Nationwide , nearly half a dozen states are considering variants of such bills , some of which throw in the origin of life and climate change for good measure .
Legislators in Florida recently introduced such a bill in response to new educational standards that were the first to formalize the teaching of evolution .
Althought two incompatible bills passed the state House and Senate , they died when the legislature went out of session ; similar measures are still pending in other states .
These bills appear to have originated at the pro-Intelligent Design thinktank the Discovery Institute , and constitute part of its latest effort towards reducing the teaching of evolution in public schools .
Manufacturing controversies
So , might Discovery actually be on to something here ?
It 's worth doing a comparison of the controversies they'd like to see taught with the topics that are considered controversial within the actual scientific community .
It 's pretty easy to get a sense for what Discovery thinks is a controversy by looking at Explore Evolution , the textbook they have created in the hope of encouraging schools to teach it .
Those ostensible controversies fall into three major groups : existence of common descent , power of natural selection , and the existence of proteinaceous machines .
Common Descent : Discovery presents common descent as controversial exclusively within the animal kingdom , as it focuses on embryology , anatomy , and the fossil record to raise questions about them .
In the real world of science , common descent of animals is completely noncontroversial ; any controversy resides in the microbial world .
There , researchers argued over a variety of topics , starting with the very beginning , namely the relationship among the three main branches of life .
Russ Doolittle presented an analysis based on individual folds in proteins that clearly resolved the Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukaryotes , while a distant relative , Ford Doolittle , argued that the prevalence of horizontal gene transfer at the bacterial level made any such trees questionable , or at best uninformative .
Meanwhile , Thomas Cavalier - Smith argued forcefully that gene - based trees miss out on significant evolutionary events , such as the transition that gave the Archaea a radically different membrane chemistry .
Almost anyone who touched on the subject ( and there were several speakers that did ) gave a confused picture of what the genome of a Eukaryote looked like before it first took a mitochondrion on board .
These are areas of real controversy ; Cavalier - Smith seemed to introduce half his slides by pointing how they showed where others had gone wrong .
But it 's worthwhile noting that there is essentially no overlap with the areas that Discovery would like to pretend are controversial .
Ford Doolittle , in fact , made repeated reference to the fact that there were areas that phylogenetic trees made sense for tracing common descent , and that the animal kingdom was one of them .
Natural Selection : Explore Evolution seems to think a reply can be made to the arguments in favor of natural selection .
Based on the symposium , the scientific community clearly does n't .
Selective pressure made appearances in nearly every session .
Selection for self - replicating RNAs and for enclosing biochemical precursors within membranes were central to the origin of life work of Gerald Joyce and Jack Szostack , respectively .
At the other end of the spectrum , the researchers exploring human evolution ( Katherin Pollard , Bruce Lahn , and Svante Pääbo ) spoke of the challenges of identifying signs of selection amidst the genetic drift that 's occurred within the genomes of mammals in general and primates in particular .
Here , it was clear that there simply is no controversy .
In contrast to the arguments over bacterial trees and the origin of eukaryotes , none of the researchers felt compelled to explain or justify their focus on the role of mutation and selective pressure .
Concerns , when they arose , were simply focused on identifying the consequences of selection .
As such , Discovery 's focus on presenting a controversy here seems hallucinatory .
Molecular Machines : Michael Behe , a Discovery fellow , has advanced the argument that some aspects of cellular life are analogous to machinery , and thus must have required the same attentive design that a machine does .
This proposal is flawed on a number of levels , and has not gained enough traction within the biological community to rise to the level of anything beyond a distraction .
But items
Behe might consider molecular machines did appear in the talks , and their role was informative .
The proteasome is one complex of dozens of proteins that was mentioned in a couple of talks .
Despite the enormous complexity and large number of specialized proteins in a proteasome , evolution readily explains its origins through gene duplication and specialization .
Simplified forms , with fewer proteins , exist in Archaea and Bacteria .
Not only are these simple versions of the proteasome an indication of its evolution , the gradual increase in its complexity allowed researchers to use it to infer evolutionary relationships among the three branches of life .
Similar analyses were performed with actin and tubulin , essential components of the complex skeletons that support Eukaryotic cells .
Structural relatives of these genes appear in Bacteria and Archaea , where they appear to act to separate cell components even in the absence of a complex skeleton .
An essential component of some Eukaryotic RNA interference systems also shows up in Archaea , where it does something completely unrelated to RNA interference .
In all of these cases , parts of the supposedly designed machinery exist elsewhere , where they perform more limited but often related roles .
Their use in determining evolutionary relationships did n't so much as elicit a blink from an audience of scientists .
Taking controversy to the classroom
Other controversies within the evolutionary field popped up in the discussion .
Bruce Lahn reiterated his controversial proposal that an allele of a key gene in human brain development came via Neanderthals .
Andrew Roger suggested that secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis may have scrambled parts of the eukaryotic family tree .
Peter Holland , who works on amphioxus , described some confusion about the precise location of the base of the chordate tree , while Ulrich Technau mentioned that the single axis that exists in Cnidarians may not be equivalent to either of the two axes of bilaterians .
Evolution clearly has no shortage of controversies .
But none of those controversies involve the basic principles of evolution , and all of them operate within a framework where random mutation and selection play a key role in creating diverse species that are related by common descent .
It 's clear that the Discovery Institute is trying to introduce controversies that do n't exist , while ignoring those that do .
That 's why the academic freedom bills it 's promoting are such dangerous things ; while supposedly promoting intellectual analysis , they 're actually an attempt to pave the way for misinformation to enter the scientific classroom .
Is there room for the real controversies in the classroom of public schools ?
Maybe , but I 'm not in any way convinced .
I would be pleasantly surprised if the average high school student left knowing what horizontal gene transfer is , what the proteasome does , or the significance of the Archaea .
Understanding how those things play out within the current scientific understanding of evolution is going to be beyond all but the most advanced students .
Teaching even the real controversies may simply be bad pedagogy .
Bush spent the morning fear mongering leading up to today 's imminent [ budget debate going slowly ] vote on the critical FISA bill .
House Dem leadership hits back :
Q : " Are you saying the President is lying ? " A : Speaker Pelosi : " That ’s the same question I got in 2001 when they asked me when I said ‘ the intelligence on Iraq does not support the threat , of an imminent threat , to our country ’ that the Administration is contending ... I said then , and I say now , I am stating a fact .
The President is wrong and he knows it . "
Steny Hoyer : " ... The White House insistence that Congress provide telecommunications companies that participated in the President ’s surveillance program with blanket immunity is neither justified nor in keeping with our nation ’s legal tradition .
In essence , the President is asking Congress to immunize companies for their conduct – despite the fact that Congress is not sure what conduct it would be immunizing , and despite the fact that serious questions have been raised about the legality of the surveillance program .
Congress owes the American people more than blind obeisance to the Executive Branch .... "
James Clyburn : " The absurd and outrageous allegations made by President Bush this morning that FISA legislation being considered in the House would make America less safe are false and misleading ....
I encourage the President to stop the scare tactics and work with Congress on legislation that improves our national security and moves our country in a New Direction . "
Standing up to Bush , passing the House bill -- and getting as many Blue Dogs as possible voting yes will send a message to Bush - - but more importantly to the Senate -- that this is a reasonable and responsible solution on retroactive amnesty , and will further isolate Rockefeller and his cronies .

Justice Department investigating two US Attorneys for political prosecution
Mississippi US
Attorney said to share tax returns of one of his targets with unauthorized personnel 
The US Justice Departments Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) is investigating the conduct of at least two specific US Attorneys in the selective prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman , sitting Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver E. Diaz Jr. , and Mississippi attorney Paul Minor , according to attorneys close to the investigation .
In a May 5 letter sent to House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) , OPR Director H. Marshall Jarrett wrote that OPR currently has pending investigations involving , among others , allegations of selective prosecution relating to the prosecutions of Don Siegelman , Georgia Thompson , Oliver Diaz and Paul Minor . 
RAW STORY has confirmed that Leura Canary ( above right ) , the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama , and Dunnica Lampton , the US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi , are under investigation .
Their offices are also being probed .
Canarys office prosecuted Siegelman ; Lamptons office prosecuted Diaz and Minor .
The US Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin , Steven Biskupic , who prosecuted Georgia Thompson , was not mentioned by those familiar with the probe .
Neither Canary 's office nor Lampton 's office responded to calls for comment .
What is being investigated ?
Individuals close to the investigation , who spoke under condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about the inquiry , would not discuss which specific issues OPR is investigating in Canarys case .
Additional information about Dunnica Lamptons case , however , was provided by two attorneys close to the OPR investigation .
According to both sources , Lampton is alleged have shared the confidential income tax returns of a target of one of his prosecutions with non-authorized  individuals .
Neither source would provide the name of the person whose income tax returns were shared or with whom Lampton shared the private information of his target and in what context .
The alleged misuse of private tax information would make the probe into Lampton a criminal investigation and likely under the purview of the DOJ Inspector General 's office , with OPR as part of a joint investigation .
According to the two attorneys , the person in Lampton 's office tasked to be the point - person in the investigation is Alfred B. Jernigan Jr. , the Civil Chief for the US Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Mississippi .
Reached by telephone last week , Jernigan said that his office had recused itself from the investigation and he could not discuss anything relating to the case with the press .
Jernigan would not provide the name of the current point - person on the case or say whether the case is entirely related to the allegations of sharing confidential income tax information or if those allegations are part of the larger investigation by OPR into alleged political prosecutions .
Asked if the investigation into Lampton was criminal , Jernigan responded ,  Oh , it s nothing like that at all . 
It is unclear when the OPR investigation began .
The May 5 Department of Justice letter is in response to an April 17 letter from Chairman Conyers to Mr. Jarrett and Mr. Glen A. Fine , Inspector General for the US Department of Justice , requesting that OPR investigate allegations of a series of political prosecutions and possible White House involvement in urging that these cases move forward despite protests from professional Justice Department staff .
The cases under review
Don Siegelman : Former Alabama Democratic Governor Don Siegelman was defeated in the 2002 Alabama gubernatorial race by Republican Bob Riley .
A consultant to Rileys campaign , Bill Canary , is a long - time business associate of Karl Rove , former White House Deputy Chief of Staff and senior aide to the president .
Canarys wife , Leura Canary , was appointed to be the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama by President George W. Bush .
Ms. Canarys office investigated Siegelman on charges of bribery and corruption , twice allegedly timing indictments for maximum impact on upcoming elections .
Ms. Canary has stated that she recused herself from the Siegelman case , but no evidence has been furnished by the Justice Department to prove that Ms. Canary did in fact recuse herself .
Initially denied an appeal bond , Siegelman served nine months in a federal penitentiary before being released in March of this year .
( See the Raw Story ongoing investigation into Siegelmans case in Part I , II , III , and VI of our investigative series into political prosecutions . )
Oliver E. Diaz Jr. : Sitting Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver E. Diaz Jr. won re-election in 2000 to the states highest bench against Republican - backed opponent Judge Keith Starrett .
A long - time Starrett friend and colleague , Dunnica Lampton , was appointed by President George W. Bush as US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi in 2001 , taking office in 2002 .
Immediately after taking office , Lampton began investigating Diaz , Judge John Whitfield , and Judge West Teel , along with attorney Paul Minor , for bribery and mail fraud .
Minor had signed off as a loan guarantor for the judges campaign , a legal act under Mississippi law .
Although there was no evidence of any quid pro quo , and Diaz had recused himself from all cases involving Minor and / or his clients , Lampton secured an indictment against Diaz .
During the first trial , the jury acquitted Diaz .
Within days , however , Lampton unsealed a second set of indictments against Diaz , alleging tax evasion by both Diaz and his wife .
Diaz was acquitted again , while Jennifer Diaz pleaded guilty after she was allegedly threatened with losing her children .
Lampton has said that he recused himself from the case , but no evidence of his recusal has been made public .
Moreover , Lampton appeared with members of the prosecutorial team during the trial and as a part of press conferences .
( See the Raw Story ongoing investigation into Diazs case in Parts IV , V , and VI of our investigative series into political prosecutions . )
Paul Minor : Famed plaintiffs attorney Paul Minor - who made his name taking on big tobacco in the 1990s  was indicted under the RICO statue for signing off on a loan guarantee for Judges Wes Teel , John Whitfield , and Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver Diaz .
Although no proof of a quid pro quo was offered by the prosecution , Lampton brought charges of bribery and mail fraud against Minor and the judges .
Minor , Teel , and Whitfield were acquitted of most charges .
Diaz was acquitted of all charges .
Shortly after their acquittal , Minor , Teel , and Whitfield were indicted on fresh charges , on which all three were ultimately convicted after the jury had deadlocked several times .
( See the Raw Story ongoing investigation into Diazs case in Parts IV , V , and VI . )
Georgia Thompson : Georgia Thompson was a purchasing supervisor for the state of Wisconsin , originally hired in 2001 during the administration of a Republican governor .
She was indicted in 2006 on charges of having steered a state travel contract to a firm whose executives had contributed to the 2004 campaign of Democratic Governor Jim Doyle .
Thompson was convicted on two felony counts and sentenced to 18 months in prison , and her case became an issue in Doyle 's 2006 campaign .
Her conviction was reversed on appeal in 2007 , with one of the judges calling the evidence beyond thin . 
Democrats have questioned whether US Attorney Steve Biskupic  who argued during the trial that even though there was no pay to play deal  the campaign donations had been part of an overall picture  might have been under pressure from the White House or Justice Department to bring charges against an innocent state employee in hopes of getting to Governor Doyle .

The cases of Don Siegelman in Alabama , Oliver Diaz and Paul Minor in Mississippi , and Georgia Thompson in Wisconsin stand at the center of what appears to be growing evidence of the politicization of the Department of Justice during the administration of George W. Bush .
The US Attorney scandal that came to light early in 2007 involved the firing of eight attorneys who had failed to prove themselves as loyal supporters of Bush Administration causes .
One US Attorney appears to have been removed for her interest in probing Republican corruption , another for his failure to bring trumped - up charges against Democrats , and a third for lack of interest in pursuing specious claims of voter fraud ultimately designed to disenfranchise minorities .
RAW STORY s Permanent Republican Majority series , however , has revealed a new scandal behind the US Attorney firings by concentrating on the US Attorneys who were not fired  and attempting to offer a possible explanation as to why .
The charges against Governor Siegelman were used as a campaign issue to ensure his defeat by Republican challenger Bob Riley in 2002 and to forestall his re-election campaign in 2006 .
Siegelman has repeatedly stated that he believes former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove was issuing the orders for his prosecution  a claim based both on Siegelman 's long experience with Rove , through Roves involvement in Alabama elections , and on a claim by whistleblower Dana Jill Simpson that she heard Rove mentioned during a Riley campaign conference call .
RAW STORY s investigation has found evidence to corroborate the allegations .
In Part III of our series , we found that Rove had been allegedly conducting meetings with operatives from Rileys campaign in Washington DC .
In Mississippi , the main target appears to have been Paul Minor , a wealthy trial lawyer and the largest Democratic donor in the state .
The charges there were brought by US Attorney Dunnica Lampton , who was on an early list of those who might be fired but was ultimately spared the ax .
Judge Diaz has suggested , more tentatively , that Rove might have been involved in his case as well .
One striking connection between the Alabama and Mississippi prosecutions is the role played in both by Noel Hillman , then the head of the Public Integrity Section at the Department of Justice .
Hillman was particularly active in the Siegelman prosecution , even traveling to Alabama for the press conference announcing the indictments , and was closely involved in the management of the Mississippi case .
Hillman was later appointed to a federal judgeship by President Bush .
The situation in Wisconsin is less clear , but there too it appears that a Democratic governor 's re-election campaign may have been what prompted the bringing of charges against an employee .

A former senior aide to President Bush claims that the White House deliberately mounted a dishonest propaganda campaign to sell the Iraq invasion to the US public , in the most damning insider account of the presidency so far .
Scott McClellan , who worked for Bush for seven years , including three as White House spokesman , brands the war a " serious strategic blunder " and " not necessary " .
The scathing comments stunned Washington yesterday because the Bush team , until now , has had a reputation for intense loyalty to their boss .
Republican strategists and former White House colleagues turned on McClellan , accusing him of writing the book for the money and asking why , if he felt as he had , he did not resign at the time .
The White House expressed sadness and puzzlement .
McClellan 's comments are from What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception , to be published on Monday but excerpts of which appeared on the Washington - based Politico website .
On Iraq , McClellan says Bush and his advisers " confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candour and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war " .
He accuses Bush and his advisers of being more interested in permanent campaigning for re-election in 2004 than what was best for the country .
McClellan admits he had misled the White House press corps , but had done so unknowingly and regrets that he " fell far short of living up to the kind of public servant I wanted to be " .
He also blames the US media for being too compliant and not sceptical enough in the run-up to war .
The White House does not normally comment on such books , but was forced to do so yesterday because McClellan had been such an integral part of the administration .
Dana Perino , the present White House spokeswoman , said : " Scott , we now know , is disgruntled about his experience at the White House .
For those of us who fully supported him , before , during and after he was press secretary , we are puzzled .
It is sad - this is not the Scott we knew . "
She said Bush had been briefed on the book but she did not expect him to respond .
" He has more pressing matters than to spend time commenting on books by former staffers . "
But the book dogged Bush throughout yesterday on a trip to the west , fundraising for the Republican candidate in the November general election , John McCain , and to make a speech on Iraq .
The account of how the White House manipulated public opinion is politically awkward for McCain , who must decide whether to distance himself further from Bush .
McClellan says in the 341 - page book that the way Bush managed the Iraq issue from the summer of 2002 " almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option " .
The US invaded in 2003 .
The propaganda was part of the Bush administration 's general approach to being in office .
Bush wanted to achieve what his father failed to do , win a second term .
McClellan says : " In the permanent campaign era , it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the president 's advantage . "
Its aggressive stance involved " never explaining , never apologising , never retreating " .
Bush has suffered this onslaught from one of the quieter members of his team .
Although he had a prominent role as the White House 's public front , McClellan tended to maintain a low profile at staff meetings .
He gave no indication during his time as press secretary that he was disgruntled .
Part of the reason McClellan may have turned on his former boss is the Lewis " Scooter " Libby affair , which began with misleading information about Iraq and uranium , and ended with Libby being sentenced to jail , though he was released after an effective Bush pardon .
Karl Rove , who had been Bush 's chief of staff and is now a commentator on Fox News , said yesterday that McClellan had been out of the loop on many issues and had never expressed his concerns while working for the administration .
Another former colleague , Frances Townsend , told CNN : " For him to do this now strikes me as self - serving , disingenuous and unprofessional . "
Todd Boulanger , a Republican strategist , said : " If he was that outraged , why did he not resign ? "
Inside stories
Among the first of the critics from inside the Bush administration was Paul O'Neill , who had been secretary to the Treasury .
Although he did not write The Price of Loyalty , the book that appeared in 2004 , he heavily briefed its author .
In interviews to coincide with publication , he said that Bush at cabinet meetings was " like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people " .
Richard Clarke , a national security adviser , wrote Against All Enemies the same year , in which he was critical of Bush administration 's failure in counter - terrorism ahead 9/11 as well as the Iraq invasion .
Ari Fleischer , who was Bush 's press secretary from 2001 to 2003 , when he was replaced by McClellan , wrote a largely loyal account of his time in the job , Taking Heat , The President , the Press and My Years in the White House .
John Bolton , one of the administration 's neo-conservatives who ended up as ambassador to the United Nations last year published Surrender Is Not An Option .
He remains loyal to Bush , critical only in that he felt the administration did not go far enough , and was not tough enough with the UN or with Iran .
Chicago pastors still remember Obama making the rounds of local churches and conducting interviews — in organizing lingo , " one - on - ones " — where he would probe for self - interest .
The Reverend Alvin Love , the Baptist minister of a modest brick church amid the clapboard bungalows of the South Side , was one of Obama 's first one - on - ones .
During a recent visit to his church , Love told me , " I remember he said this to me :
There ought to be some way for us to help you meet your self - interest while at the same time meeting the real interests and the needs of the community . ' " . . .
He was sometimes more interested in connecting with folks on the South Side than organizing them .
He studied the characters he encountered so closely that [ fellow organizer Mike ] Kruglik says Obama turned his field reports into short stories about the hopes and struggles of the local pastors and congregants with whom he was trying to commune .
Where some of Alinsky 's disciples speak of his work with religious fervor , Obama maintained some detachment during these years .
. . .
As it was , he ran into the same roadblock as his trainers had .
" Obama , " Galluzzo told me , " was constantly being harassed by people saying , Oh , you work for that white person . ' "
On one occasion , he eagerly tried to make his pitch about joining DCP [ Developing Communities Project ] to a Reverend Smalls .
Smalls was n't interested .
" I think I remember some white man coming around talking about some developing something or other , " he told Obama .
" Funny - looking guy .
Jewish name . "
His hostility only grew when Obama explained that Catholic priests were also involved .
" Listen ... what 's your name again ?
Obamba ? "
Smalls asked without waiting for an answer .
" Listen , Obamba , you may mean well .
I 'm sure you do .
But the last thing we need is to join up with a bunch of white money and Catholic churches and Jewish organizers to solve our problems . "
Obama left the meeting crestfallen .
On a Sunday morning two weeks before he launches his presidential campaign , Obama is at Trinity United Church of Christ on the South Side , gently swaying from side to side under a giant iron cross .
From the outside , the church looks more like a fortress than a house of worship , with high whitewashed brick walls topped with security cameras .
Inside , Trinity is the sort of African American community that the young Obama longed to connect with when he first came to Chicago .
The church 's motto is " unashamedly black and unapologetically Christian , " and sunlight streams through stained glass windows depicting the life of a black Jesus .
The Reverend Doctor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , Trinity 's pastor since 1972 , flies a red , black , and green flag near his altar and often preaches in a dashiki .
He has spent decades writing about the African roots of Christianity , partly as a way to convince young blacks tempted by Islam that Christianity is not " a white man 's religion . "
On this particular Sunday , the sea of black worshippers is dotted with a few white folks up in the balcony , clutching copies of The Audacity of Hope they 've brought for Obama 's book - signing later .
Obama , sitting in the third row with his wife and two daughters , Malia and Natasha , stands , claps , prays , and sways along with the rest of the congregation .
During the sermon , he watches the preacher carefully and writes notes .
When asked by Wright to say a few words , Obama grabs the microphone and stands .
" I love you all , " he says .
" It 's good to be back home . "
The 150 - person choir breaks into a chorus of " Barack , Hallelujah !
Barack , Hallelujah ! "
This adulation is a far cry from how Obama was received by Wright when they first met in the mid-'80s , during Obama 's initial round of one - on - ones .
Like Smalls , Wright was unimpressed .
" They were going to bring all different denominations together to have this grassroots movement , " explained Wright , a white - haired man with a goatee and a booming voice .
" I looked at him and I said , Do you know what Joseph 's brother said when they saw him coming across the field ? ' "
Obama said he did n't .
" I said , Behold the dreamer !
You 're dreaming if you think you are going to do that . ' "
A Reverend Philips put the problem to him squarely when he learned that Obama did n't attend services .
" It might help your mission if you had a church home , " he told Obama .
" It does n't matter where , really .
What you 're asking from pastors requires us to set aside some of our more priestly concerns in favor of prophesy .
That requires a good deal of faith on our part .
It makes us want to know just where you 're getting yours from . "
After many lectures like this , Obama decided to take a second look at Wright 's church .
Older pastors warned him that Trinity was for " Buppies " — black urban professionals — and did n't have enough street cred .
But Wright was a former Muslim and black nationalist who had studied at Howard and Chicago , and Trinity 's guiding principles — what the church calls the " Black Value System " — included a " Disavowal of the Pursuit of Middleclassness . ' "
The crosscurrents appealed to Obama .
He came to believe that the church could not only compensate for the limitations of Alinsky - style organizing but could help answer the nagging identity problem he had come to Chicago to solve .
" It was a powerful program , this cultural community , " he wrote , " one more pliant than simple nationalism , more sustaining than my own brand of organizing . "
As a result , over the years , Wright became not only Obama 's pastor , but his mentor .
. . .
Wright is one of the first people Obama thanked after his Senate victory in 2004 , and he recently name - checked Wright in his speech to civil rights leaders in Selma , Alabama .
The church also helped Obama develop politically .
It provided him with new insights about getting people to act , or agitating , that his organizing pals did n't always understand .
" It 's true that the notion of self - interest was critical , " Obama told me .
" But Alinsky understated the degree to which people 's hopes and dreams and their ideals and their values were just as important in organizing as people 's self - interest . "
He continued , " Sometimes the tendency in community organizing of the sort done by Alinsky was to downplay the power of words and of ideas when in fact ideas and words are pretty powerful .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , all men are created equal . '
Those are just words .
I have a dream . '
Just words .
But they help move things .
And I think it was partly that understanding that probably led me to try to do something similar in different arenas . "
In 1995 , Obama shocked his old friend Jean Rudd by telling her he wanted to run for the state Senate .
Back in 1985 , Rudd , then working at the Woods Fund — a Chicago foundation that gives grants for community organizing — had provided Kellman with his original $ 25,000 to hire Obama .
When Obama returned to Chicago to practice law , he joined the board of Rudd 's foundation .
Now he was going to the other side .
" That 's a switch ! " she told him .
Obama insisted that nothing would change .
" Oh no , " he said , according to Rudd .
" I 'm going to use the same skills as a community organizer . " . . .
But when those supporters become a liability , Obama has not been afraid to take a direct , confrontational approach .
Reverend Wright learned this recently , on the evening before he was scheduled to deliver the invocation at Obama 's presidential announcement speech in Springfield .
According to The New York Times , after Trinity 's Afrocentrism — which had originally drawn Obama to the church in the 1980s — had become a sticky campaign issue , Obama called his old friend and told him it was probably best if the pastor did n't speak , after all .
The following day , Wright could be seen silently watching the proceedings from the sidelines along with other Obama supporters .
. . .
In our last conversation , . . .
I asked Obama if his reputation for purity is a little overblown .
He chuckled " I would n't be a U.S. senator or out of Chicago or a presidential candidate from Illinois if I did n't have some sense of the world as it actually works , " he said .
" When I arrived in Chicago at the age of twenty - four , I did n't know a single person in Chicago , and I know an awful lot of folks now .
And so , obviously , some of that has to do with me being pretty clear - eyed about power . "
Angelina and Brad Donate $ 1 M to Iraqi and US Kids
The Jolie - Pitt Foundation , established byand , has announced a large donation of $ 1 million will be distributed among four organization on behalf of children who have lost parents , homes and schools in Iraq .
Children in the U.S. who have suffered the loss of a parent in the Iraq war will also benefit from this generous allotment of relief funds .
The money will be divided between the Armed Services YMCA Operation Hero Program to aid in providing military children with educational support and counseling , Women for Women International which will provide books , school supplies and basic necessities to Iraqi women and their children , the International Rescue Committee which will use the money to repair three schools that will then be available to 2,500 children and NineMillion.org which will provide uniforms and learning materials to 2,000 Iraqi children .
The couple have been living on the French Riviera since the end of April .
They have been in seclusion following a whirlwind two weeks in the spotlight as part of the Cannes Film Festival .
The couple had been staying at the home of Paul Allen , co-founder of Microsoft at Villa Maryland in St. Jean Cap Ferret .
They recently signed a three year lease on the magnificent Chateau Miraval , where they have successfully alluded photographers for the past month .
Angelina is said to be due to give birth to twin girls in August .
Many have speculated that the blessed event is more likely to occur in July .
An interesting side note is that Angie 's personal assistant , Holly Goline is also with child .
The two were photographed together at Cannes .
This caused some to surmise that the look - alike might be used as a body double on occasion or actually be the surrogate mother to one of the ' twins ' .
The first photos could be worth $ 10 million in what is likely to be a hot bidding war .
Check out photos of the Jolie Pitt family and of Angie and her assistant below .

( CNN ) --
In a stinging passage from a " Letter from Birmingham City Jail , " the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. condemned white churches for rejecting his pleas for support .
Popular pastors such as Bishop T.D. Jakes have built megachurches and empires with the prosperity message .
" In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro , I have watched white churches stand on the sideline and merely mouth pious irrelevancies , " King wrote from jail during the 1963 Birmingham , Alabama , demonstrations .
The contemporary white church has largely accepted King as a religious hero .
Yet some observers say there is one religious community that continues to shun King -- the black church .
Forty years after his death , King remains a prophet without honor in the institution that nurtured him , some black preachers and scholars say .
They also say King 's " prophetic " model of ministry -- one that confronted political and economic institutions of power -- has been sidelined by the prosperity gospel .
Prosperity ministers preach that God rewards the faithful with wealth and spiritual power .
Prosperity pastors such as Bishop T.D. Jakes have become the most popular preachers in the black church .
They 've also become brands .
They 've built megachurches and business empires with the prosperity message .
Black prophetic pastors rarely fill the pews like other pastors , though , because their message is so inflammatory , says Edward Wheeler , a church historian .
Prophetic pastors like the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , the former pastor for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama , often enrage people because they proclaim God 's judgment on nations , he says .
" It 's dangerous to be prophetic , " said Wheeler , who is also president of the Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis , Indiana .
" I do n't know many prophetic preachers who are driving big cars and living very comfortably .
You do n't generally build huge churches by making folks uncomfortable on Sunday morning , " he said .
The prosperity gospel started as a fringe doctrine in the black church .
It was pioneered by " Rev. Ike , " a prosperity televangelist with a pompadour who boasted during his heyday in the 1970s that " my garages runneth over . "
Jonathan Walton , author of " Watch This !
Televangelism and African American Religious Culture , " says that although people may have chuckled at Ike 's flamboyance , his theology exerts more influence in the modern black church than King's .
" King got the glory and the history books , but ... [ Ike has ] got the numbers , " said Walton , who is also an assistant professor of religious studies at the University of California , Riverside .
Black prosperity preachers say their message is not based on greed , though , but self - help .
Bishop Paul Morton , senior pastor of Greater St. Stephens Full Gospel Church in New Orleans , Louisiana , says that teaching black people better money management is the " next dimension " of King 's ministry .
" The Bible said that the poor we will always have with us , " he said .
" It 's up to us to bring ourselves out of the curse of poverty . "
Morton was the only black prosperity preacher contacted who agreed to talk about King 's ministry .
Many of the black church 's most popular prosperity preachers -- the Rev. Creflo Dollar of Atlanta , Georgia ; the Rev. Fred Price of Los Angeles , California ; and Bishop Keith Butler of Detroit , Michigan -- all declined .
Jakes , the most popular prosperity preacher ( he made the cover of Time magazine in 2001 ) , declined to talk as well .
He did , however , address his views on social justice in August on " Religion & Ethics , " a PBS news program .
" I 'm not against marching , " Jakes said .
" But in the '60s , the challenge of the black church was to march .
And there are times now perhaps that we may need to march .
But there 's more facing us than social justice .
There 's personal responsibility , motivating and equipping people to live the best lives that they can . "
The debate between self - help and political activism is nothing new in the black community .
Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois clashed over the issue at the beginning of the 20th century .
Most black prophetic teachers teach self - help along with activism .
King was caught in the middle of this debate early in his ministry .
King became prominent after leading the Montgomery bus boycott in 1956 , but he was already gaining a name for himself in the National Baptist Convention , the largest black church organization in the nation .
King wanted to use the convention as an institutional base for the movement .
But his tactics -- civil disobedience , publicly confronting segregationists -- were repudiated by convention leaders and the Rev. J.H. Jackson , the convention president , says Wheeler , the church historian .
" He thought that if blacks were good citizens , worked hard and did what was expected , our rights will come ; we would prove out merit , " Wheeler said .
In 1961 , King tried to orchestrate the election of a leader to replace Jackson .
He and a group of black ministers attempted to vote Jackson out of office at the convention 's annual meeting .
It was a disaster .
According to Taylor Branch 's Pulitzer Prize - winning book , " Parting the Waters : America in the King Years , " ministers exchanged blows .
One lost three teeth .
Another was killed when his skull was fractured .
Riot police were called out to separate the warring pastors .
Jackson kicked King out of the convention and held onto power .
The pastors who aligned themselves with King formed their own group , the Progressive National Baptist Convention .
The schism remains today .
Wheeler says the black church 's rejection of King was n't confined to its leadership .
Most people in the pews did n't want to get involved .
The movement was driven primarily by younger people .
Fear was the primary reason , he says .
" We forget that people were getting killed , churches being burned , " he said .
" It was the common understanding that things were not going to change , that people were getting killed for nothing . "
A new generation of prophetic ministers in the black church is now trying to do what King once attempted : gain a voice in the establishment .
Four years ago , a group of them formed the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference .
Proctor was a scholar and college president who was active in the civil rights movement .
The annual conference attempts to preserve the prophetic voice of black churches by bringing like - minded pastors together for support and advice .
A few prophetic pastors have even talked about taking another approach to raising their profile in the black church : television , says Lawrence Mamiya , a professor of religion at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie , New York .
" Some of them have talked about the need to get on television and try to counter the televangelists , but I do n't know of any social justice preacher who has a broad television audience , " he said .
At least one young prophetic minister has found a prominent place in the public eye .
The Rev. Raphael Warnock , senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta , where King preached , says that prosperity preaching is not just a distortion of Jesus ' message but a betrayal of the black church 's heritage .
The black church was formed by slaves who saw Jesus ' message as a tool for social justice .
" The prophetic voice of the black church is the very reason for its being , " Warnock said .
" The only reason that there 's such a thing as the black church is because of the question of freedom , justice and equal access . "
Walton , the University of California scholar , says contemporary black churchgoers have now embraced another mission : equal access to wealth .
" It 's the theological doctrine of American culture , " he said .
King 's voice may ring out in the history books , but it no longer rings out in the black pews .
Walton says the battle between the prophetic and prosperity ministers in the black church is over for now .
The Rev. Ikes have won .
" Many Americans give lip service to entering the social justice arena and speaking out against the economic and politically powerful , " Walton said , " but very few of us are willing to pay the price . "
" We like to identify with Dr. King in theory , though we emulate Rev. Ike in practice . "

Essentially , they built a web version of Keynote and they are calling it 280 Slides .
It looks really slick / nice and they did a great job with the UI .
Out of curiosity , I called up Firebug to see what Javascript framework was used .
I was quite surprised to find a lot of requests for ‘.j ’ files .
It turns out that these guys loved Objective - C so much that they wrote their app in a form of Objective - C which I am assuming is translated to Javascript .
Very Cool !

Signaling he has written off today ’s West Virginia primary , Sen. Barack Obama took aim this week at the five remaining Democratic contests -- and the fall election , planning a stop in suburban Detroit , home to many “ Reagan Democrats ” a generation ago .
During a short visit Monday to West Virginia , Obama took a swipe at presumptive Republican nominee John McCain for not backing a Democratic Senate bill on veterans ’ benefits .
Then Obama dropped by a pool hall before leaving the state -- which Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is heavily favored to win .
Clinton spent a long day campaigning in West Virginia , including a stop in Logan , where she argued that she was more electable than Obama .
“ West Virginia is a real indicator of where the political winds are going to blow , ” she told a cheering crowd .
“ The goal is to nominate someone who can beat John McCain in November . ”

Clinton stressed her economic plan , including her proposals to improve access to affordable healthcare and to suspend the 18.4 - cent - a- gallon federal gasoline tax over the summer .
McCain supports the tax moratorium ; Obama has dismissed it as a gimmick .
But Clinton attacked Bush administration policies more than she did Obama , apparently mindful of Democratic concerns that the candidates not inflict damage on each other .
Obama and Clinton planned to head to Washington today for a Senate vote on a bill to recognize collective - bargaining rights for public safety workers , an important issue for labor .
He represents Illinois ; she represents New York .
Clinton planned to fly to Charleston for an election - night celebration and then return to Washington .
She has announced no campaign events for Wednesday .

Obama appeared Monday in Louisville , Ky. , which votes May 20 .
He will then shift focus to the November battleground states of Missouri and Michigan before resuming the nomination fight in South Dakota and Oregon .
Next week he goes to Florida .
On Monday , as he has in recent days , Obama largely ignored Clinton in his speech in Charleston .
But he took direct aim at McCain over what should be a signature issue for the Arizona senator and former Vietnam War prisoner : veterans benefits .
Obama reiterated his support for Virginia Democratic Sen. Jim Webb ’s 21st Century GI Bill -- Clinton signed on as a co-sponsor in May 2007 , Obama in November -- and criticized McCain for backing what Obama said was a less - ambitious version .

“ He is one of the few senators of either party who oppose this bill because he thinks it ’s too generous , ” Obama said .
“ At a time when the skyrocketing cost of tuition is pricing thousands of Americans out of a college education , we should be doing everything we can to give the men and women who have risked their lives for this country the chance to pursue the American dream . ”
The McCain campaign fired back , noting that Obama voted against an Iraq war spending measure that included $ 1.8 billion for veterans medical care .
Obama opposed the bill because it did not include a plan to bring the troops home .
“ It is absurd for Barack Obama to question John McCain ’s commitment to America ’s veterans , when Obama himself voted against funding our nation ’s veterans and troops in the field during a time of war , ” said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
McCain and the Democrats also tussled over global warming .
McCain , in Oregon , endorsed a “ cap and trade ” policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and vowed to work through the United Nations to devise a global approach .

Clinton dismissed McCain ’s plan as insufficient .
“ Real leadership means taking this problem head - on with a comprehensive , science - based plan instead of halfway measures .
While Sen. McCain ’s proposals may be improvement on President Bush ’s , that ’s not saying much . ”
Obama targeted McCain ’s voting record .
“ It is truly breathtaking for John McCain to talk about combating climate change while voting against virtually every recent effort to actually invest in clean energy , ” he said .
While the campaigns tossed statements back and forth , Obama continued to gain superdelegates , including Sen. Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii and Rep. Tom Allen of Maine .
According to an Associated Press tally that includes pledged delegates and superdelegates , Obama has 1,871.5 delegates to 1,697 for Clinton , with 2,025 needed to win .

Fiore reported from West Virginia and Martelle from Los Angeles .
I spend a lot of time convincing my friends to switch to a Mac .
Some of my friends are also software developers so naturally , just when they think the evangelism has come to an end , I convince them to get on the Rails .
However , learning Rails usually means learning Ruby for the first time as well .
In this post I am going to address one of the issues I see for newcomers to Ruby .
Looping .
Looping in Ruby seems to be a process of evolution for newcomers to the language .
Newcomers will always find their way to the for loop almost immediately and when confronted with iterating an array , the first choice will generally be a for ..in :
a = [ 1,2,3,4 ] for n in a puts n end
This works , but its not very …
Ruby .
The next stage of evolution will be using an iterator for the first time .
So the for loop gets dropped all together and each is used .
The Rubyist is born at this point :
a.each do |n| puts n end
What I see next is a lot of conditional logic being used inside the each block .
The logic is generally introduced to perform the following operations :
Building a list of items from an array .
Total the items in an array .
Find an item in the array .
So if this is you , then stop .
Ruby has plenty more iterators where each came from .
Which one you should be using depends on what operation you are trying to perform .
So let ’s take a look at our previous list and see if we can find a more Ruby way to get them done .
Building a list of items from the array using select
For this operation you should be using select .
The way select works is simple , it basically iterates through all the elements in your array and performs your logic on each one .
If the logic returns TRUE , then it adds the item to a new array which it returns when the iteration is complete .
Here ’s an example :
a = [ 1,2,3,4 ] a.select { |n| n > 2}
This will return the last two elements in the array : 3 and 4 .
Why ?
Because 3 and 4 are both greater than 2 , which was the logic we placed in the block .
It ’s worth noting that select has an evil step sister named reject .
This will perform the opposite operation of select .
Logic which returns FALSE adds the item to the array that is returned .
Here ’s the same examples as before except we will swap select , with reject :
a = [ 1,2,3,4 ] a.reject { |n| n > 2}
In this example the return value is [ 1,2 ] because these elements return false when the condition is tested .
I also have to mention another close sibling to select and reject ; collect , which returns an array of values that are the RESULT of logic in the block .
Previously we returned the item based on the result of the CONDITION in the block .
So perhaps we need square the values in our array :
a = [ 1,2,3,4 ] a.collect { |n| n*n}
This returns a new array with each item in our array squared .
Finally , note that using select , reject , and collect returns an array .
If you want to return something different , because you are concatenating or totaling values , then check out inject .
Total the items in an array using inject
When you think of accumulating , concatenating , or totaling values in an array , then think of inject .
The main difference between select and inject is that inject gives you another variable for use in the block .
This variable , referred to as the accumulator , is used to store the running total or concatenation of each iteration .
The value added to the accumulator is the result of the logic you place in the block .
At the end of each iteration , whatever that value is , can be added to the accumulator .
For example , let ’s sum all the numbers together in our array :
a = [ 1,2,3,4 ] a.inject { |acc , n| acc + n}
This will return 10 .
The total value of all the elements in our array .
The logic in our block is simple : add the current element to the accumulator .
Remember , you must do something to the accumulator in each iteration .
If we had simply placed n in the block the final value of the accumulator would have been 4 .
Why ?
Because its the last value in the array and since we did not add it to the accumulator explicitly the accumulator would be replaced in each iteration .
You can also use a parameter with the inject call to determine what the default value for the accumulator is :
a = [ 1,2,3,4 ] a.inject ( 10 ) { |acc , n| acc + n}
In this example the result is 20 because we assigned the accumulator an initial value of 10 .
If you need to return a string or an array from inject , then you will need to treat the accumulator variable that way .
You can use the default value parameter of inject to do this :
a = [ 1,2,3,4 ] a.inject ( [ ] ) { |acc , n| acc << n+n}
In this example I add n to itself and then append it to the accumulator variable .
I initialized the accumulator as an empty array using the default value parameter .
Find an item in the array using detect
Our last example operation was to find an element in the array .
Let ’s just put it out there and say that other iterators could be used to select the correct value from the array , but I am going to show you how to use detect to round out our exploration of these iterators .
So let ’s find the value 3 in our array using detect :
a = [ 1,2,3,4 ] a.detect { |n| n == 3}
This returns 3 .
The value we were looking for .
If the value had not been found , then the iterator returns nil .
So if your head is spinning at this point as to which iterator to use for when , then remember this :
Use select or reject if you need to select or reject items based on a condition .
Use collect if you need to build an array of the results from logic in the block .
Use inject if you need to accumulate , total , or concatenate array values together .
Use detect if you need to find an item in an array .
By using these iterators you will be one step closer to mastering …

How many times do we need to get fooled before we wise up ?
As bubble after bubble in market after market drives up prices , how many times will we just sit there and take it in the wallet as those who are making obscene profits tell us “ it is just supply and demand ” ?
The truth is , actual demand for oil is not increasing faster than supply .
What is increasing is artificial demand , driven by tax breaks such as the “ Enron Loophole ” that make it hugely profitable to drive up the price , taking money directly out of your pocket and into the pockets of rich speculators .
And who is behind these tax breaks ?
Watch Keith Olbermann ’s special report on who these people are , and whose campaign they all seem to be working for :
Updated BT , the UK 's largest broadband provider , has begun threatening subscribers with disconnection from the internet if it is told they are sharing copyright music over peer - to - peer networks , The Register has learned .
The firm recently sent an email to one of its four million retail broadband customers , who asked not to be named , alleging that she had illegally participated in a network sharing of Biology , a song by Girls Aloud .
The email reproduces evidence collected by the BPI .
It purports to show she used the open source filesharing program Ares in May this year to infringe sound recording copyright .
Ares can be used as a client for both Gnutella and BitTorrent networks .
Geoff Taylor , chief of UK record industry trade body the BPI , told The Register in a statement today : " Establishing partnerships with ISPs is the number one issue for the BPI , and we are beginning to form positive working relationships with BT , Virgin Media and most of the other major ISPs . "
It 's unclear whether BT has agreed to formally implement the record industry 's preferred " three strikes " procedure that would see those accused of infringing music copyright warned twice and suspended or disconnected from the internet .
Taylor continued : " Everyone agrees on where we need to be , and we are working closely with our colleagues across the music community , the more progressive ISPs , and government to get us there . "
BT said : " We do n't comment on commercial relationships and communications with individual customers . "
A spokesman said BT broadband customers who are infringing copyright over peer - to - peer networks can expect a similar threat if the BPI provides evidence against them .
Accusations and evidence
The BPI evidence BT shared with its customer consists of the Ares user agent , a timestamp , a file name and an IP number .
BT 's letter , from a member of its " Customer Security Team " states : " I have received a complaint regarding one of our customers offering copyrighted material over the internet .
On investigation , I have found that your account was used to make this offer . "
Collecting this kind of evidence does not require ISPs to monitor their customers ' internet connection .
BPI investigators are simply able to collect lists of IP numbers participating in copyright - infringing peer - to - peer networks and trace which operator they belong to .
Assuming the ISP has agreed to do so , it can then identify the individual account holder without sharing personal information with the BPI .
Committed downloaders are able to take technical counter - measures to dodge detection , but the record industry is hoping to win back the mass market - it knows the hardcore are lost for good .
The BT letter goes on to threaten that if the customer continues to fileshare illegally , her broadband account will be shut down : " Sorry , but we 're obliged to point out that further similar problems may have to lead to the termination of your account , as such activity contravenes BT's Acceptable Use Policy . "
It recommends that she ensure her Wi-Fi connection is secure , remove all filesharing software from her computer , and pass the warning on to the rest of her household .
In the BPI letter forwarded to the customer by BT , the trade body says it will look out for further illegal filesharing on her account .
" If further evidence is obtained of infringement via your internet connection , " it writes , " then further action is likely to be taken against you .
That action may include litigation against you , as well as the suspension by BT of your internet connection . "
New research may shed light on how homosexuality has survived in the gene pool .
Homosexuality in males may be caused in part by genes that can increase fertility in females , according to a new study .
The findings may help solve the puzzle of why , if homosexuality is hereditary , it has n't already disappeared from the gene pool , since gay people are less likely to reproduce than heterosexuals .
A team of researchers found that some female relatives of gay men tend to have more children than average .
The scientists used a computer model to explain how two genes passed on through the maternal line could produce this effect .
In 2004 the researchers studied about 200 Italian families and found that the mothers , maternal aunts and maternal grandmothers of gay men are more fecund , or fruitful , than average .
Recently , they tried to explain their findings with a number of genetic models , and found one that fit the bill .
" This is the first time that a model fits all our empirical data , " said Andrea Camperio - Ciani , an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Padova in Italy who led the study .
" These genes work in a sexually antagonistic way — that means that when they 're represented in a female , they increase fecundity , and when they 're represented in a male , they decrease fecundity .
It 's a trait that benefits one sex at the cost of the other . "
The researchers detail their findings in the June 18 issue of the journal PLoS ONE .
If this scenario turns out to be true , it could help explain the seeming paradox of hereditary homosexuality .
Since gay people are less likely to reproduce than heterosexuals , many experts have wondered why , if homosexuality is caused by genetic factors , it would n't have been eliminated from the gene pool already .
But if the same genes create both homosexuality in men and increased fertility in women , then any losses in offspring that come about from the males would be made up for by the females of the family .
" Sexually antagonistic selection is an old idea by Richard Dawkins , but this has never been proven in humans , " Camperio - Ciani told LiveScience .
" There are a large quantity of these traits found in insects , for example , and recently in deer sexually antagonistic traits have been discovered , showing that high - ranking males produce rather unsuccessful daughters .
We found that sexually antagonistic selection is operating also in our species , and we found it in a very important trait , which is homosexuality . "
A possible scenario
The question of whether homosexuality is genetically inherited has been perplexing scientists for years .
While many researchers now agree homosexuality is probably caused by a mixture of nature and nurture , they are still hard pressed to explain the particulars .
Even if this sexually antagonistic genetic system is at work , it can only account for a portion of the overall causes of homosexuality in men , Camperio - Ciani said .
Other factors , both genetic and social , likely also play a part .
" I think it 's almost beyond a doubt that genes have some influence , " said Ray Blanchard , a researcher at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto , who studies the effect of birth order in predicting whether a male will be born homosexual .
" My personal view is that there is probably more than one biological mechanism contributing toward homosexuality .
I think it 's also safe to say that there is at least one non-genetic influence . "
Blanchard found that with each older brother in a family , the odds increase by about a third that a boy born later will be gay .
This effect is not thought to be caused by genetics , but rather by antibodies produced by the mother 's immune system during pregnancy .
Eric Vilain , a professor of human genetics at the University of California , Los Angeles , has studied possible biological factors influencing homosexuality .
He said the system studied by the Italian team seems plausible , but that it 's too soon to be convinced .
" I would like to see the first observation reproduced in a different population and possibly with a larger sample to make sure that this holds up , " he said .
" If it is replicated , that 's a very interesting finding .
It 's a possible scenario . "
Research by Paul Vasey , a psychologist at the University of Lethbridge in Canada , and his graduate student , Doug VanderLaan , provides preliminary support for the Italian team 's results .
The scientists studied homosexual men in Independent Samoa , known locally as fa'afafine ( " in the manner of a woman " ) .
They found that the mothers of fa'afafine produce more offspring than the mothers of heterosexual men in that society .
" [ Camperio - Ciani ’s ] results are consistent with a growing number of studies that suggest that the female relatives of male homosexuals are more fecund than those of male heterosexuals , " Vasey said .
Loving men
Camperio - Ciani and his team hypothesize that the genes they modeled may cause people of both sexes to be extremely attracted to men , which would lead men with the genes to pursue relationships with other men , while causing women with the genes to have more sexual partners , and become pregnant slightly more often than an average woman .
This system does not address causes of homosexuality in women , he said .
" We 're still working on lesbianism , but were not getting to the same result , and possibly we 'll come out with a completely different explanation , " he said .
The research may shed light on a complicated and controversial topic : whether homosexuality is a choice , or whether it is caused by factors beyond a person 's control .
" I think this is an example where the results of scientific research can have important social implications , " Camperio - Ciani said .
" You have all this antagonism against homosexuality because they say it 's against nature because it does n't lead to reproduction .
We found out this is not true because homosexuality is just one of the consequences of strategies for making females more fecund . "
Goldman also forecasts prices will rise further next year to average $ 148 .
" Tight supply conditions continue to be the primary catalyst for higher crude prices , " the bank said in a research note .
" The near - term outlook for oil prices continues to be bullish . "
The Goldman forecast helped send crude prices to a record high of $ 127.82 on Friday , analysts said .
The 2009 estimate is the most bullish among more than 30 banks regularly polled by Reuters .
Goldman , one of the first to point to triple - digit oil more than two years ago -- a once unthinkable level -- earlier this month said oil could shoot up to $ 200 within the next two years .
Its note on Friday said that despite the advent of alternative sources such as biofuels , oil supply growth has slowed to 1 percent from about 1.8 percent in 2005 and less than the bank 's forecast for 2008 world GDP growth of 3.8 percent .
" Given this imbalance , long - term oil prices will need to continue to rise , " Goldman said .
Goldman 's view that prices are rising in response to tight supply contrasts with others in the industry that oil 's rally is being driven by factors beyond supply and demand fundamentals .
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , source of two in every five barrels of oil , has rebuffed calls from the U.S. and other industrialised countries for more oil , saying supply is sufficient .
In OPEC 's view , factors like the weakness of the U.S. dollar , speculative trading , a lack of capacity at oil refineries and political tension are lifting prices , not a lack of oil .
Royal Dutch Shell Plc , the world 's second - largest fully publicly traded oil company by market value , has also said current prices contain an element of speculation .
Goldman is the latest bank to raise its price outlook this week .
UBS lifted its projection on Thursday and said inflation risks from rising oil costs would put a global economic recovery in 2009 - 2010 at risk .
In a note , the bank said oil economist Jan Stuart had lifted the UBS oil price forecast for U.S. crude to $ 115 a barrel from $ 86.96 , a 32 percent rise .
The newest word on the interwebs is that the fine folks at ESPN are contemplating
Daily Show
- type programming
.
They feel they need to do something to get viewers to turn on the Deuce after ten o’clock at night , and they apparently feel that comedy - talk programming is the way to go .
There are a couple of problems with this , I think .
First , it seems to me that ESPN is missing the point of The Daily Show .
They think it ’s a funny show about politics , so they want to do a funny show about sports .
But if you really pay attention to The Daily Show , you know that it ’s actually a funny show about the media in which politics play a very large role .
The whole conceit revolves around the pompous anchors and reporters who do n’t care about facts but are more interested in he - said / she - said arguments .
The jokes come from President Bush saying something really stupid , then showing how the media completely change the statement to one of genius .
ESPN thinks it can do The Daily Show about sports , but for the show to work , they ’ve got to make fun of the broadcasts .
And does anyone out there really think ESPN is going to let someone in their employ go on air and point out the utter lack of content in Dick Vitale ’s analysis , or make fun of Mel Kiper ’s inability to nail draft choices , or ask why it ’s John Kruk who is pontificating on the art of playing the outfield on Baseball Tonight ?
I do n’t think so .
But my biggest problem is really a simple one :
Why does n’t ESPN just program sports ?
It ’s a sports network , after all .
Do we really need even more versions of Around The Horn or Jim Rome Is Burning or Pardon The Interruption ?
And let ’s face it , Keith Olbermann , Dan Patrick , Craig Kilborn and Charley Steiner are gone .
Those guys were funny .
They could probably pull off the type of program that ESPN wants to do – in fact , they did ; the late edition of SportsCenter in the '90s was a thing of beauty full of wit , intelligence and sports .
So , ESPN , I ’ve got an idea for ESPN 2 .
Show live sporting events .
And if there is n’t a sporting event , then how about a straight sports wrap - up show .
You know , something with scores and analysis .
Forget the forced humor .
Do n’t give us anymore of that “ cool side of the pillow ” crap .
Just give the scores and analysis .
Leave the buffoons and stupidity to Fox ’s NFL Sunday pregame .
Trust me on this : straight scores and analysis , that we ’ll watch .
Mohr Sports , we wo n’t .

The Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution , adopted at the end of the civil War in 1865 , abolished slavery , but this same amendment expressly permits prison slavery and involuntary servitude .
AMENDMENT XIII — SECTION 1
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
The United States has less than 5 percent of the world 's population and almost 25 percent of the world 's prisoners .
Are Americans more criminal than other folks ?
Or are there incentives that give the US the dubious honor of leading the world in prison population .
Prison labor has its roots in slavery .
After the 1861 1865 Civil
War a system of “ hiring out prisoners ” was introduced in order to continue the slavery tradition .
Freed slaves were charged with not carrying out their sharecropping commitments ( cultivating someone else 's land in exchange for part of the harvest ) or petty thievery — which were almost never proven — and were then “ hired out ” for cotton picking , working in mines and building railroads .
The tradition continues .
The nation needs a way to fill the prisons which provide a source of cheap labor .
Surely the criminal justice system can be of help here , and indeed they are .
Gerry Spence , the famed criminal lawyer , in his book From Freedom To Slavery , tells us : “ I found that the minions of the law — the special agents of the FBI — to be men who proved themselves not only fully capable , but also utterly willing to manufacture evidence , to conceal crucial evidence and even to change the rules that governed life and death if , in the prosecution of the accused , it seemed expedient to do so . ”
Well surely the court judges are concerned with justice ?
Spence : “ We are told that our judges , charged with constitutional obligations , insure equal justice for all .
That , too , is a myth .
The function of the law is not to provide justice or to preserve freedom .
The function of the law is to keep those who hold power , in power . ”
Now the law enforcement authorities do n’t do this all by themselves .
For one thing , they have onerous laws to help them .
It is instructive to look at the state of California in this regard .
The California Prison system is the third largest penal system in the country , costing $ 5.7 billion dollars a year and housing over 170,000 inmates .
Since 1980 the number of California prisons has tripled and the number of inmates has jumped significantly .
In the past few years controversies involving prison expansion , sky - rocketing costs , and claims of mismanagement and inmate abuse have put the California prison system under heightened public scrutiny .
What caused prisons to be a growth industry in California ?
Did Californians suddenly become lawless ?
We need look no further than the CCPOA , the California Correctional Peace Officers Association .
" The Power this prison guards ' union wields inside our prisons , legislative chambers and governor ’s office disturbs me .
It should disturb every citizen . " ~ Judith Tannenbaum , formerly an English teacher at San Quentin State Prison
The CCPOA is the biggest contributor to political campaigns in California .
The CCPOA gives twice as much in political contributions as the California Teachers Association , yet it is one - tenth its size .
In 1998 , the CCPOA gave over $ 2 million to Governor Gray Davis , $ 763,000 to the media , and over $ 100,000 to Proposition 184 , the 3 Strikes law .
The 3 Strikes law mandated that convicted felons with one prior felony got twice the normal sentence for their 2nd strike , and convicted felons with two or more prior felonies would get at least 3 times the normal sentence or 25 years ( whichever is more ) for their 3rd strike .
The CCCPOA has a vested interest in locking up more and more Californians for longer sentences .
The California prison guards union has grown from a fledgling group of fewer than 2500 members in 1978 to a powerhouse of 31,000 members who contribute $ 21.9 million dollars a year .
The union employs a 91 person staff including 20 full - time attorneys and uses the services of five lobbyists and a team of public relations consultants , housed in the 62,000 square foot CCPOA headquarters .
The state hiring office for prison guards brags that the job has been called the greatest entry - level job in California — and for good reason .
“ Along with the great salary , ” one of their ads notes , " our peace officers earn a retirement package you just can't find in private industry . "
California prisons are managed by an agency with 60,000 employees , including the 30,000 in the prison guards ’ union .
California ’s fourth prison chief in a row , Jim Tilton , is leaving earlier than planned from a meat - grinder of a job reputed to be among the toughest in state government .
So what makes the incoming Matt Cate think he can depart on his own terms ?
“ This mission is where my heart is , ” said Cate , named by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to the $ 225,000 - a- year job running the state ’s massively challenged prison agency .
“ Public safety has been my career because I care about it . ”
Currently California is in a fiscal crisis , so Governor Schwarzenegger is proposing the early release of some 22,000 inmates and eliminating about 4,500 prison guard positions to help shave $ 400 million from the budget of the state corrections department .
The guards ’ union is unhappy with that scenario , and has allied with victims ’ associations to fight it .
Meanwhile overcrowding in state prisons results in violence .
A stabbing attack on four guards at one overcrowded state prison and a racially sparked brawl at another mark the type of violence that guards , inmates ’ attorneys and Schwarzenegger have been worried about for years .
What to do with all these prisoners ?
A US prison population of over 2 million people — mostly Black and Hispanic — are working for various industries for a pittance .
For the tycoons who have invested in the prison industry , it has been like finding a pot of gold .
They do n't have to worry about strikes or paying unemployment insurance , vacations or comp time .
All of their workers are full - time , and never arrive late or are absent because of family problems ; moreover , if they do n't like the pay of 25 cents an hour and refuse to work , they are locked up in isolation cells .
Private companies , now numbering 135 , began using prison labor in the 1970s .
Microsoft , McDonalds , TWA , IBM , Victoria 's Secret , AT&T and Toys R
Us are just some of the companies that use prisoners to cheaply produce products or provide services .
While the rate of pay may vary from state to state , the constant is that the great majority of the money that the companies pay goes to the state in which the prisoners are incarcerated .
For instance , in California prisoners receive the " minimum wage " on paper , but the state takes 80 percent for state restitution , anti-drug campaigns , victim 's rights organizations and a prisoner " trust fund . "
The state of Colorado employs prison labor for everything from agriculture , which includes running a fishery , dairy farm and harvesting grapes , to making furniture and firefighting .
Colorado legislators recently passed some of the most restrictive immigration laws in the country following a massive mobilization for immigrant rights .
The new laws scared away workers , causing many crops to spoil in the fields for lack of farm workers .
The Colorado farm owners ' answer to this crisis is to find labor even more exploitable than immigrant workers — prison labor " chain gangs . "
And the need for more prisoners is thereby increased even more .
The prison industry complex is one of the fastest - growing industries in the United States and its investors are on Wall Street .
This multimillion - dollar industry has its own trade exhibitions , conventions , websites , and mail - order / Internet catalogs .
It also has direct advertising campaigns , architecture companies , construction companies , investment houses on Wall Street , plumbing supply companies , food supply companies , armed security , and padded cells in designer colors .
The federal prison industry produces 100 % of all military helmets , ammunition belts , bullet - proof vests , ID tags , shirts , pants , tents , bags , and canteens .
Along with war supplies , prison workers supply 98 % of the entire market for equipment assembly services ; 93 % of paints and paintbrushes ; 92 % of stove assembly ; 46 % of body armor ; 36 % of home appliances ; 30 % of headphones / microphones / speakers ; and 21 % of office furniture .
Airplane parts , medical supplies , and much more : prisoners are even raising seeing - eye dogs for blind people .
It might be a good idea to get away from these public union - driven prisons .
How about private prisons ?
The number of prisoners in private prisons grew more than 3,000 percent between 1987 and 2004 , soaring from 3,122 to 98,700 .
Two companies dominate the for - profit incarceration industry — Corrections Corporation of America ( CCA ) and the GEO Group , formerly known as Wackenhut Corrections .
These two companies control 75 percent of the for - profit incarceration market .
The highest - paying private prison is CCA in Tennessee , where prisoners receive 50 cents per hour for what they call “ highly skilled positions . ”
The problem with prison privatization is that Corporate - owned prisons need a steady flow of inmates to maintain profits .
To protect their profit margins , prison companies exert political influence by contributing thousands of dollars to state political campaigns .
Lobbyists for private prisons support tough - on - crime legislation that ensures the continued need for prison space , including mandatory minimum sentences , life terms for " three strikes , " and sentencing juveniles as adults .
We ’re back where we started , with the private corporations doing what the California union is doing — promoting the supply of more inmates in more prisons with longer sentences .
So there we have it .
America , with one - quarter the population of China , has 500,000 more prisoners than China and many of them are hard at work .
US citizens are placed in long - term involuntary servitude with the help of law enforcement and onerous laws pushed by a prison workers union and private prison corporations , and it ’s all constitutional .

MUMBAI : Buoyed by its success in pushing through a quota for OBC students in higher education , the government has now ordered IITs to introduce - with " immediate effect " - quotas in the teaching faculty for scheduled castes , scheduled tribes and OBCs .
IIT directors , not surprisingly , were livid with the decision , though none of the four TOI spoke to were willing to go on record .
The high quality of IIT faculty has built the institution into a globally respected brand .
Said an IIT - Delhi professor : " It is hard to imagine that even teachers will now use the caste flag to get in . "
The government diktat dated June 9 , which has been sent to all the IITs , lays down 15 % quota for SC , 7.5 % for ST and 27 % quota for OBCs in teaching positions .
IITs currently have reservations for backward category candidates for
administrative posts - from attendants to the level of deputy registrar .
However , there is no reservation for faculty members in these premier technological institutes .
The order signed by Seema Raj , director of technical education in the HRD ministry , read , " I am directed to say that the matter relating to reservation of SC , ST , OBC categories in recruitment to teaching ( faculty ) posts in the IITs was considered in the second meeting of the SCIC ( Standing Committee of IIT Council ) held on 11/2/2008 .
The recommendations made by the SCIC have been accepted by the chairman of ( the ) IIT Council .
Accordingly , it has been decided to implement reservation for SC , ST , OBC , in recruitment to teaching ( faculty ) posts in IITs with immediate effect . "
For subjects in science and technology , posts will be reserved for lecturers and assistant professors .
In areas like management , social sciences and humanities , reservations will be applicable up to the professor level .
The ministry allows IITs to dereserve the posts after a year , if they do not get filled " despite all efforts " .
Insiders feel that merit , on which brand IIT rests , would be shaken by the decision of the government .
The order specifies that in departments dealing with science and technology subjects , " reservation shall be applied to the extent possible at the school or broad branch of engineering , at least , if not at the individual department level . "
The IIT directors TOI contacted , who were yet to convey the order to their faculty members , said they are shocked by the decision .
" Some of the finest people have given up top positions and fat cheques that were offered to them in other parts of the world to come and teach in the IITs , despite the low pay scale that the government offers .
With reservation in faculty positions , I see a day , not far from now , when the IITs will crumble , " said one director .
Another director said that there had been no bias against hiring backward category candidates to teaching positions if they were found meritorious .
" Till now , if a backward category candidate was found on par with another candidate , the former was given preference , but reservation will change the atmosphere on campus , " said the director .
All directors agreed that such reservations for faculty posts would mar the quality of education at the institutes .
The lecturer���s post in the IITs is a contractual one and the basic salary is Rs 10,000 per month .
Usually , fresh PhD candidates are taken in at this level .
If their services are found satisfactory , they are promoted to assistant professor and get onto the permanent rolls of the IITs .
But now , almost half the posts - 49.5 % to be precise - will be reserved at both these levels .
An outage affected the Mozilla.com website on the day the organisation launched its Guinness World Record attempt for downloads of the new Firefox 3 browser .
The mozilla.com site was unreachable from around the world , occasionally responding with the message , " Http / 1.1 Service Unavailable " .
Melissa Shapiro posted a statement on the Mozilla blog to say that their servers were feeling the burn and should be back to normal shortly .
An earlier post stated that the record attempt would begin today at 5 pm UTC , but Shapiro announced after this time that the 24 hour period in which the downloads will be counted will begin once the site goes live .
Netcraft was able to access the Firefox 3 download page again shortly after 7 pm UTC , but the Service Unavailable message was still seen occasionally .
For some period before this , the page was still offering version 2 downloads , yet a Mozilla press release confirmed that Firefox 3 had indeed already been released .
A follow - up post on the Mozilla blog officially announced that the 24 hour period had begun , with Guinness counting all complete downloads of Firefox 3 before 18:16 UTC tomorrow .
The outages also affected the www.spreadfirefox.com website .

TOKYO ( AP ) 
A money - losing Japanese train company has found the purr - fect mascot to draw crowds and bring back business — tabby Tama .
All the 9 - year - old female cat has to do is sit by the entrance of western Japan 's Kishi Station , wearing a black uniform cap and posing for photos for the tourists who are now flocking in from across the nation .
Her job makes cultural sense in Japan , where cats are considered good luck and are believed to bring in business .
Tama has done such a good job of raising revenue for the troubled Kishikawa train line that she was recently promoted to " super-station - master . "
" She never complains , even though passengers touch her all over the place .
She is an amazing cat .
She has patience and charisma , " said Wakayama Electric Railwayspokeswoman Yoshiko Yamaki .
" She is the perfect station master . "
People have been snatching up novelty goods — postcards , notebooks and erasers — bearing Tama 's photos .
The cat had been about to lose her place to live , with the nearby store where she was raised being torn down .
Now , the station is home .
The Kishikawa line had been losing $ 4.9 million a year as passenger numbers fell steadily to as low as about 5,000 a day , or some 1.9 million a year .
After Tama 's appointment last year passenger numbers have risen by 10 % to about 2.1 million a year .
In December , Tama was rewarded with bonus pay — all in cat food .

A jury convicted Robert A. Williams of attempted murder , rape and arson on Tuesday for the attack on a former Columbia University journalism student who was tortured and raped repeatedly for 19 hours last year .
It took the jury just over five hours to reach its verdict  guilty on 44 counts , not guilty on 2  which were read without Mr. Williams in the courtroom .
He refused to come to court for most of the trial , remaining in a holding cell .
Mr. Williams , 31 , was sleeping when his lawyer notified him that the jury had reached a verdict , and he did not respond and went back to sleep , Justice Carol Berkman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said just before the foreman read the verdict .
Mr. Williams is to be sentenced next month and could spend the rest of his life in prison .
When Mr. Williams was told that the jury found him guilty , “ He did n’t really do anything except what he ’s been doing all along , which is being uncommunicative with me , ” his lawyer , Arnold J. Levine , said in an interview outside the courtroom .
Mr. Levine said he would appeal .
However , looking at the historical record , we see that two of the Soviet Union 's / Russia 's most valuable American sources were , in fact walk - ins : CIA agent Aldrich Ames and FBI agent Robert Hanssen ( who actually might better be described as a write - in and phone - in source to the Soviets , as he never physically met his handlers , and his true name remained unknown to them ) .
These two walk - ins disclosed to the Soviets / Russians details of virtually every U.S. intelligence operation being run against them .
But what if the Soviet and Russian intelligence bureaucracy had mulishly insisted that before crediting any intelligence provided by these unsolicited , volunteer spies , they would have to pass polygraph tests ?
Might Ames have shown consistent , specific , and significant reactions when asked by untrusting KGB agents whether anyone from the U.S. Government had instructed him to approach them , just because he was nervous about the possible consequences of not being believed ?
Of course !
And had the Soviets / Russians believed in lie detectors , and had Ames failed to pass their " test , " they might well have lost one of the most valuable assets they ever had .
Similarly , Hanssen , who refused to meet with his controllers , or even divulge his real name to them , might have been rejected from the get - go for his refusal to submit to polygraph screening .
It 's worth noting that a double - agent sent to a U.S. intelligence agency as a walk - in is presumably more likely to have been trained in polygraph countermeasures , and to understand that the " test " is a pseudoscientific sham , than a bona fide walk - in .
Czech double - agent
It will probably never be known how many golden opportunities the U.S. intelligence community has lost because of its misplaced reliance on polygraph results .
But by terminating this foolhardy practice now , it can prevent such lost opportunities in the future .
Intelligence agencies are understandably suspicious of so - called " walk - in " sources : those who have n't been " pitched " by one of the agency 's own intelligence officers , but who come in off - the - street volunteering their services .
There 's a natural suspicion that such a person is more likely to be a plant , a double - agent , sent by a foreign intelligence service or an organization such as Al - Qaeda .
The CIA has a long - standing practice of polygraphing walk - ins , and it appears that it has in the past relied upon polygraph results to discredit them .
However , looking at the historical record , we see that two of the Soviet Union 's / Russia 's most valuable American sources were , in fact walk - ins : CIA agent Aldrich Ames and FBI agent Robert Hanssen ( who actually might better be described as a write - in and phone - in source to the Soviets , as he never physically met his handlers , and his true name remained unknown to them ) .

Czech double - agent Karl Koecher , who " defected " to the United States and eventually infiltrated the CIA received such training .
It may be the case that the double - agent is more likely to pass the polygraph than the legitimate walk - in source .
It will probably never be known how many golden opportunities the U.S. intelligence community has lost because of its misplaced reliance on polygraph results .
But by terminating this foolhardy practice now , it can prevent such lost opportunities in the future .
Webb : Bush would be first to veto veterans ' benefits Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Sunday May 18 , 2008

Print This Email This Some politicians have no qualms about using other people 's military service for their own benefit , but appear to be reluctant to extend a benefit with historical precedent to those who have served , said Senator Jim Webb during an interview with NBC's Tim Russert this morning .
" The Republican Party ... continually seeks to politicize military service for its own ends even as it uses their sacrifices as a political shield against criticism for its failed policies , " Webb wrote in his book , A Time to Fight .
" And in that sense , it is now the Republican Party that most glaringly does not understand the true nature of military service . "
The Senator opined that Republicans have benefited from a climate of anti-war and perhaps anti-military sentiment stemming from the Vietnam era , resulting in well - meaning but misguided activism among Democratic - leaning people , and Republicans have won the image of being more positive towards the military and military service by default .
Webb 's pending GI bill would offer tuition and living stipends to veterans similar to the benefits enjoyed by those returning from Japan and Germany in the 1940s .
" I introduced this GI bill my first day in office , " Webb said .
" The idea was to give the people who'd been serving since 9/11 the same educational benefits -- the same right to a first class future -- as those who served in World War II . "
" No president in history has vetoed as benefits bill for those who 've served , " he continued .
" [ President Bush is ] fine with sending these people over and over again where they 're spending more time in Iraq than they are at home .
" He 's fine with the notion of ' stop - loss , ' where we can ... make people stay in even after enlistments are done .
And then we say , ' Give them the same benefit that the people in World War II have , ' and they say it 's too expensive .
So I think the Republican Party is ... on the block here to clearly demonstrate that they value military service , or suffer the consequences of losing the support of people who 've served . "

Highlands and Islands reporter , BBC Scotland news website
A bumblebee visiting leaves of a small tree covered with aphids A lack of suitable flowers may be forcing bumblebees to seek out aphids to feed on their sugary secretions .
The Bumblebee Conservation Trust ( BCT ) said it was a behaviour that appeared to be becoming increasingly common .
Images captured by the BBC Scotland news website in a garden in Nairn , in the Highlands , show the bees visiting tree leaves covered with aphids .
The secretions offer a substitute for nectar , but do not contain the protein the insects need to stay healthy .
There have been warnings that bumblebee and wild bee populations around the UK are experiencing " catastrophic declines " .
Bees are important pollinators of flowers and crops .
The bumblebees ' behaviour of feeding on secretions from aphids could be a further sign of the problems facing the insects .
There is a fine balance to be struck in the garden - the answer is to put plants in the garden that are of benefit to bees
Craig Macadam
Buglife Scottish officer Dr Ben Darvill , a BCT director and research ecologist based at the University of Stirling , said there have been several reports of the behaviour but the reason for it remained unclear .
He said : " It 's hard to say for sure , but it does seem as if this behaviour is becoming more common .
" Bumblebees are known to feed from aphid secretions , and from extra-floral nectaries on unlikely plants like bracken - but it's more usual to see it in upland areas where there are few other flowers around .
" The fact that it is now frequently observed elsewhere may suggest that there are fewer of the right sorts of flowers around in people 's gardens and in the wider countryside . "
Dr Darvill said a fascinating aspect of the behaviour was the bumblebees ' ability to apparently smell the sugar .
They normally choose flowers by colour , but are known to have " smelly feet " allowing them to detect if a flower has already been visited by another bumblebee for its pollen .
However , the intrigue is tinged with concern for the insects .
Dr Darvill said : " Bumblebees have struggled in recent decades from habitat loss - three species are extinct in the UK and many more are threatened - so perhaps bumblebees are having to find innovative ways of finding food . "

But he added : " Although the aphid secretions provide them with a sugary solution , a substitute for nectar , they provide no protein .
" Bumblebees can only get their protein from pollen , which they feed to their growing young , so it is essential for a healthy population . "
Research work at the University of Stirling , has demonstrated that certain pollens are particularly rich in protein , said Dr Darvill .
He said to help declining bumblebees , gardeners , farmers and land managers need to ensure a constant supply of forage plants from March through until September .
Flowers from the pea and mint families seem to be particularly beneficial .
Craig Macadam , Scottish officer with conservation group Buglife , said aphids were considered a garden pest but he would not wish to see them wiped out .
He said : " Ants often protect the aphids from other predators such as ladybirds and in return they take the honey dew secreted by the aphids .
" There is a fine balance to be struck in the garden - the answer is to put plants in the garden that are of benefit to bees . "

The sworn testimony of Scott McClellan has added more weight to HR 1258 , Dennis Kucinich ’s 35 Articles of Impeachment .
Not that the resolution was in need of even another feather ’s weight of proof — but the more , the merrier .
The Declaration of Independence was , in effect , articles of impeachment served against our first King George .
In it , Thomas Jefferson penned : " ... and when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object , evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is ( OUR ) right , it is ( OUR ) duty , to throw off such Government ... "
Inspired by Kucinich ’s bill and Jefferson ’s words , and in a flurry of matriotism , I handwrote postcards to all 40 members of the Judiciary Committee , letting them know that I want them to uphold the Constitution and impeach Bush .
( Cheney , too ! )
In my approximately 100 - word message , I thanked them for serving on the committee , and also mentioned my age ( “ mature ” ) and that this was the first time in my life that I had written to a Congressional Committee .
40 picture postcards ( on sale ) : $ 6.00
40 27 - cent stamps : $ 10.80
40 handwritten notes to Judiciary Committee : 5 hours
Participation in Democracy : PRICELESS !
Activists continue to call , write , and fax .
And it ’s working !
Another member of the Judiciary Committee , Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , has stepped forward to co-sponsor HR 1258 .
According to afterdowningstreet.org , Rep. Robert Wexler was the first to co-sponsor , then Lynn Woolsey and Barbara Lee , then Maurice Hinchey and Baldwin , then Sam Farr .
The list will be updated here : http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HE01258:@@@P
The National Lawyers Guild unanimously and enthusiastically passed a resolution supporting the impeachment of Bush and Cheney last November .
http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/28354
In September 2007 , The National Coalition of American Nuns wrote the following to each member of Congress to call for impeachment :
Dear Member of Congress :
The National Coalition of American Nuns is impelled by conscience to call you to act promptly to impeach President George W. Bush and Vice - President Dick Cheney for the following high crimes and misdemeanors :
1 . For deceiving the public under the false pretense that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ;
2 . For violating the integrity of the U.S. Constitution against the expressed will of the American people by setting up a National Security State which robs us of our Freedoms ;
3 . For destroying our reputation and the good will of other nations toward us , especially through violation of the UN charter by making a unilateral decision to wage preemptive war , by refusal to abide by the Geneva Convention regarding torture of prisoners , and by denial of habeas corpus to prisoners .
The time for impeachment is now - before the example of George W. Bush 's regime is set in stone .
Future generations will thank you for preserving the freedom of our nation and its relation to the entire human community .
Win or lose , you and we know it is the right thing to do .
Please act NOW before it is too late .
Sincerely ,
Mary Ann Cunningham SL
Grace Pleiman SFP
For the Board of the National Coalition of American Nuns

World 's Funniest Amazon.com Product Reviews Posted by Pile ( 30598 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ BSAlert * exclusive * ]
Since we have nothing better to do , and I 'm sure a cure for cancer is on the way , and our country 's democratic process is in perfect health , we here at BSA decided we could afford a more fruitless pursuit for your pleasure .
We scoured Amazon.com for funny , humorous and amusing product reviews ...
Cuisinart DGB - 600 BC
Grind and Brew Coffee maker :
This coffee - maker does so much !
It makes weak , watery coffee !
It grinds beans if you want it to !
It inexplicably floods the entire counter with half - brewed coffee when you are n't looking !
Perhaps it could be used to irrigate crops ...
It is time - consuming to clean , but in fairness I should also point out that the stainless - steel thermal carafe is a durable item that has withstood being hurled onto the floor in rage several times .
And if all these features were n't enough , it 's pretty expensive too .
If faced with the choice between having a car door repeatedly slamming into my genitalia and buying this coffee - maker , I 'd unhesitatingly choose the Cuisinart !
The coffee would be lousy , but at least I could still have children ...
Artificial insemination kit for cats
" Nothing but the best ! " is our motto when it comes to Fluffy , our long - haired tasmanian cat .
We decided that it would be cruel and inhumane to subject her to " molestation " by an unfamiliar tom - cat , so we decided to use the artifical insemination method instead .
We arranged with a local breeder to obtain some high quality DNA for breeding and we carefully read the instructions and prepared for the big event .
We even bought fluffy her favorite kitty food and let her have a little wine before we began the procedure .
Well , four bandaids , a tetanus shot and a dozen " Missing Cat " signs posted in the neighborhood and our family is back to normal .
Turns out Fluffy is a BOY CAT .
Who knew ?
We are selling the Artificial Insemination Kit on Amazon as " slightly used " so if you are looking for one , check there for a bargain !
Christian heavy metal band , Stryper 's Greatest Hits
This is truly a sign of the end times .
The Four Bee-keepers of the Apocalypse have returned to spread the gospel of non-demonic ... I mean non-denominational rock and roll .
I can't believe these guys still bother when their own people think they 're possessed by Ozzy Osbourne .
Or is it Marilyn Manson this decade ?
At any rate , this 'll at least give Eminem some fodder for future lyrics .
**
Stryper are easily the worst thing ever to happen to hair metal .
Hair metal , for you idiots who do n't know , was a more pop-friendly revolution that ran throughout the entire decade of the 80's and ended early into the 90's ( around 1992 ) .
It was led by bands like Motley Crue , Ratt , and Dokken .
It 's popularity rose to the point that two of heavy metal 's stalwarts ( Judas Priest and Ozzy ) actually made a brief conversion to the genre , and in the late 80's , even Black Metallers Celtic Frost even made a short conversion .
However , there was also a band called Stryper .
They could have been an incredible band , had the following NOT been involved in their band :
1 . A singer with a voice resembling a chorus of whining infants .
2 . The fusion of heavy metal with strong Christian beliefs .
3. Throwing BIBLES to their audience members ( ? )
**
Stryper ...eek .
They are just plain terrible .
My friend was at a concert and when they threw the bibles out at the audience one hit her on the head .
They also made my friends two year old daughter cry ... how Godly is that ?
What 's a review without covering the best - selling book in the world ?
The Holy Bible
The Holy Bible tells the story of , well , everything .
It begins with the creation of All That Is , and ends with Judgment Day ( though it 's pretty different from the one they showed in " Terminator 2 " ) .
It 's split into two parts , one old and one new .
This makes it easier to get through , sort of like " Lord of the Rings " or " Harry Potter " books .
There 's all sorts of numbers to help you keep track of where you are , so you do n't have to worry about a bookmark .
The main character in the story is God , who made Earth and stuff .
He sets a bunch of rules that he wants people to follow .
At first , all the Angels do what he tells `em , but one gets fed up and quits .
He is punished to Hell ( it 's a real place , not a cuss word ) and turns into Stan , which is a pretty cool part .
God next creates the first people , Adam & Eve ( who have a catalog named after them now .
Have you seen it ?
It 's awesome ) .
They live in a garden and are all happy and such until Eve screws up and they get evicted .
Same kinda thing happened to my brother and his girlfriend .
You also meet God 's son Jesus , who comes from above and lives with human parents .
He goes around helping people , which is cool .
Come to think of it , whoever wrote the Bible should sue the guys who make that show " Smallville . "
It 's a total rip .
Whatever .
Anyhow , Jesus tries to be a teacher and show the world how to be good , but then bad guys show up and pound on him .
If you want , you can see that in Mel Gibson 's last movie , but it 's pretty brutal .
I do n't want to give away the ending , but in the book Jesus comes back to life to save the day .
He rocks .
There 's tons of other great characters , like : Job ( I 'd love to know what his first name is ) , Noah , Lot , Lot 's Wife , Zeus , Hermaphrodite , and the Four Horsemen of Calypso .
Overall , I 'd say the Holy Bible is defenitely worth reading .
It 's really long and has some slow parts , but I liked it alot better than " Ethan Frome . "
Cool trivia : the Holy Bible is the basis of Christianity , one of the world 's most popular religions !

Looking for a spooky tale to curl up to this Halloween season ?
Is there a glaring gap between your Stephen King and Anne Rice books on the shelf ?
Here 's the perfect horror novel to plug it with !
A supernatural thriller to the core , the monster in this book will thrill and chill you !
A demonic entity named Yahweh sets humanity up with the perfect trap : the Tree of Life .
Knowing they 'll eat the otherwise purposeless fruit , he slaps them with a generational curse that binds them to his malevolent will !
What follows is the most twisted tale of evil ever written !
Yahweh , egotistical and ragingly jealous , uses those under his control to rape and pillage cultures that do n't worship him .
Men , women and animals alike were slain in these bloodthirsty raids .
The only hope you had was being a virgin woman whom Yahweh encourages to be conquested [ Deuteronomy 21:10 - 13 ] , [ Deuteronomy 20:13 - 16 ] .
If you have a hard time reading about cruel animal and human sacrifices , perverted sexual references and the murder and abuse of children I suggest not picking this up .
This is a true tale of horror and our villian is far from tactful !
However , Yahweh 's not a transparent , homocidal manaic .
To be so would be far too predictable and I commend the author on his skillful character development .
What makes
Yahweh so fiendish is that he commits his violent acts under the veneer of love !
To fool humanity futher he sent down a hippy version of himself and later set that person up to die , quenching his bloodlust once again .
But , that 's not where the horror ends !
I hate to give away the ending but it 's far too devious to go unmentioned !
In the end his cult followers will be sucked into an alternative dimension where they will toil and praise his ego to neverending extents .
Those who choose not to accept his conditional , unconditional love will find themselves in a sadistic torture pit of his making .
What 's really neat about this work of fiction is you do n't even have to pay for it !
There 's many fan bases out there that will happily provide you with a copy !
***
If I could bring 10 books to a desert island , I 'd bring 10 copies of the bible .
It is just that good .
***
This book is the product of a severely diseased mind .
Every human perversion and psychosis is analyzed in depth .
From all shades of prejudice , to sadism and incest , the worst of the human condition is proudly on display , married to a forceful ignorance which concludes that
1 . All homosexuals should be executed
2 . Blacks are merely slightly evolved monkeys
3 . Women are responsible for all human sin and weakness
4 . The world is a 6000 year old floating disk around which sea monsters patrol .
( Various copies of this book omit this statement , as it was proven wrong in the late 15th Century .
Unfortunately for the faithful , this book is the inspired word of their invisble friend who lives in the sky , whom they call " God " .
This God is incapable of speaking anything but the truth .
Thus to omit or change any statement from the original bible is to move against God , and imply that he is capable of being wrong , which throws the whole text out the window . )
5 . A man named Moses was given a tablet listing ten commandments , which govern human morality .
Sadly ,
God is plagarizing the ancient Egyptians and their Book of the Dead here , which had essentially the same list , and was created much earlier than this Judeo - Christian work .
A decidedly low blow by God there , as the ancient Egyptians never had the Book of the Dead copyrighted , and can not sue him .
Please do the right thing and burn any copies of this book which you encounter , to inhibit the spread of this idealogical cancer .
And if you ever encounter someone who actually believes the depravities and impossibilities listed in this text , please beat them about the head with a large , blunt instrument repeatedly until they come to their senses .
Think of it as your Christian duty .
***
Finally , I offer a closing warning in regards to the reading of this work , which has been known to cause confusion , self - loathing , feelings of worthlessness , erratic behavior , delusions of grandeur and extreme violence in its readers , proceed only if in sound mental health .
***
God sure sounds unhappy .
Maybe he should seek professional help for his anger .
Hell , it worked for me .
What Would Buddha Do? :
The rhetorical question , What would Jesus do , had youngsters America over confused .
Faced with the difficult choice of playing video games or doing their homework a child need only to glance down at their WWJD bracelet ... and be even more confused .
Since there was neither video games nor homework in Jesus ' day , how do I truly know which he would choose ?
A too literal reading of the question WWJD ?
would lead to the answer :
Be a carpenter , be the Messiah , preach in the temple , gather disciples , heal the lame , walk on water , and eventually be crucified by the Roman legions .
This is asking way too much of our kids !
Denon $ 500 audio cable :
Who would pay $ 451 for an audio cable ?
Obviously someone who is an audiophile , and recognizes what such a component can do for ones ' sound :
A caution to people buying these : if you do not follow the " directional markings " on the cables , your music will play backwards .
Please check that before mentioning it in your reviews .
I was disappointed .
I consider myself an audiophile - I regularly spend over $ 1000 on cables to get the ultimate sound .
I keep my music - listening room in a Faraday cage to prevent any interference that could alter my music - listening experience .
Sending any signal down ordinary copper can degrade the signal considerably .
While ordinary listeners might not notice , to somebody with even a rudimentary knowledge of sound , the artifacts are glaring .
Denon should have used silver wiring ( hermetically sealed inside the rubber sheath to prevent any tarnishing , of course ) , which has a significantly higher conductivity than copper .
Furthermore , Denon needs to treat the wires they use in the cable with a polarity inductor to ensure minimal phase variance .
***
This cable does allow for incredible sound .
However , I believe a possible side - effect from the use of this cable has not been noted by the manufacturers .
Upon playing Prince 's " Kiss " my speakers ... how should I put this ?
...
Well , I think they ... climaxed .
That 's not the end of it .
Oh , no .
My stereo system is now sentient .
And horny .
Not one of my other appliances has warranty coverage for ... well ... the kind of ' damage ' they are currently receiving .
I 'd just unplug the darn thing , but it 's developed an ability to arc pure energy when it feels threatened .
It took two scorched electricians to figure that out .
And , yes , I 've already tried flipping the breaker switch .
Does n't work .
The power wo n't go out .
I do n't understand how the hell it pulled that off .
Please , if anyone has any tips or advice , I 'm getting desperate .
My living room is some kind of sick , mechanical sex den and it 's really freaking me out .
***
On receipt , I promptly installed the Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable in my audio setup , following the provided directional arrows .
I fired up my system and installed a few CDs , and to my amazement , the increased data rate and Denon pure signal technology revealed the following :
1 ) Iron Butterfly 's In - A - Gadda - Da -Vida , once thought to be 17 minutes , 5 seconds long is , in actuality 18 minutes , 35 seconds in length .
In this extended sequence , Doug Ingle and Lee Dorman banter back and forth on whether there a god , and if so , why does he deny his own existence .
I also was able to make out a very faint jaw harp solo around 10 minutes in , and the fade - in of a didgeridoo in the closing stanzas .
2 ) All of Barry White 's material was actually sung by a woman .
And at least 100 of my friends agree .
3 ) Although it is believed that the Beatles backmasked secret messages into some of their songs , the high - fidelity provided by the Denon AKDL1 revealed a normal message spanned across the White Album , consisting of Ringo and George reading " The Great Gatsby " using cockney rhyming slang and pig latin .
I am extremely pleased at the quality of these cables , and I would definitely recommend them to my friends , family , pets and complete strangers .
***
If I could use a rusty boxcutter to carve a new orifice in my body that 's compatible with this link cable , I would already be doing it .
I can just imagine the pure musical goodness that would flow through this cable into the wound and fill me completely -- like white , holy light .
Holding this cable in my hands actually makes me feel that much closer to the Lord Jesus Christ .
I only make $ 6.25 / hr at Jack In The Box , but I saved up for three months so I could have this cable .
It sits in a shrine I constructed next to my futon in Mother 's basement .
I only gave it four stars in my review because I can't find music that is worthy enough to flow through this utterly perfect interconnect .
Kid's Pimp Suit Costume ( Size : X- small 4 - 6 )
Teaching your children the value of money and business sense is never easy .
However , with the introduction of the smaller size pimp suit they can learn how to start their own business without even leaving their own neighbourhood .
The people management skills this encourages are a vital start in any young man 's life .
***
My son was really set on going as a rapist this last halloween , but we waited too long to get to the costume store and so we were stuck with this or Darth Vader .
Once I explained what a pimp does , he chose this one and we could n't be happier .
He wears it around the house all the time !
Only downside was that we had to explain to him he could n't wear blackface that came with the costume because that would be offensive .
You would think the company would know not to include that makeup in 2008 ...
***
This costume has caused our family all sorts of confusion .
We dressed up our son in this pimp suit and took him trick - or - treating downtown .
It was pretty crowded on the streets and we lost him for a bit , but when we found him and got him home he took off the costume and he had turned into a 40 year old black man with a strut and a disturbing tendency to want to slap around my wife and teenage daughter .
I guess it 's nice that he does n't wet the bed anymore , and he says he can find work for our daughter , which is something he has never shown an interest in before , but we do n't understand why he keeps wanting to call her Suga Smoov .
Was there some sort of chemical in the fabric that we were supposed to wash out ?
We think perhaps we should have washed the costume before we put it on little Stevie ( who insists we now refer to him as " The Hand " ) .
Playmobile security check point play set
I was a little disappointed when I first bought this item , because the functionality is limited .
My 5 year old son pointed out that the passenger 's shoes can not be removed .
Then , we placed a deadly fingernail file underneath the passenger 's scarf , and neither the detector doorway nor the security wand picked it up .
My son said " that 's the worst security ever ! " .
But it turned out to be okay , because when the passenger got on the Playmobil B757 and tried to hijack it , she was mobbed by a couple of other heroic passengers , who only sustained minor injuries in the scuffle , which were treated at the Playmobil Hospital .
The best thing about this product is that it teaches kids about the realities of living in a high - surveillence society .
My son said he wants the Playmobil Neighborhood Surveillence System set for Christmas .
I 've heard that the CC TV cameras on that thing are pretty worthless in terms of quality and motion detection , so I think I 'll get him the Playmobil Abu - Gharib Interogation Set instead ( it comes with a cute little memo from George Bush ) .
***
This toy would be a lot more realistic with about 350 people standing in line for an average of an hour .
It still makes a nice set with the interrogation room .
***
I am holding out for the release of the Guantanemo Playset .
Hopefully this will come with an extrordinary rendition option .
***
I 've heard that they were going to publish a coupon and code , to allow us to buy this for $ 9.11
***
When I bought this toy , I was looking forward to placing my minority - action figure through the metal detector , and then running the little script I prepared : " Excuse me sir , but you have been ' randomnly ' selected for additional scans .
Please let us take a sample from your shoe while the computer analyzes findings for any radioactive or biohazardous material " .
***
Finally a toy that gets our kids used to living in a police state .
Benjamin Franklin said that those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety .
But then again , he lived in France for awhile , so what did he know about anything .
Before this toy came out I was afraid my son would not know how to cope with the new reality of American life ; how to prepare him to the future , I was wondering .
Boy am I relieved ; so many lessons learned !
Now he knows that :
1 ) Some people can make a decent living treating others like cattle , and the best part : the cattle is paying their salaries .
2 ) You only have the rights that the government gives you ; you can move around the country only if you comply with government regulations , no matter how frivolous they might be .
No liquid you say ?
except if in a ziplock bag ?
Check .
Lighter ok because the cigarette lobby fought the no-lighter rule ?
Swell .
All passengers searched but cargo mostly un-scrutinized ?
No problem .
3 ) You should always bow to people in uniforms , even though they might be in this job because they could not qualify for police work ( because of the rap sheet or the drug abuse ) .
Unfortunately , this toy comes short in a few areas :
1 ) It does not show that if you 're rich , you do n't have to wait in line for hours .
If you can travel first class , you get your own fast - track screening .
Too bad the terr'ists have plenty of Saudi and Pakistani cash and can easily travel first class should they want to .
They should have included another screening set in the box .

I purchased this product ( along with the Playmobile ambulance / mass casualty incident set and the Playmobile road construction set ) for my five year old son .
After a few hours my son asked me why our society was so keen on infringing on the civil liberties of its citizens in the name of safety and security .
Like all the other five year olds whose parents purchased this product , he is precocious and wise beyond his years .
I answered that everyone still has the right to walk anywhere in this country , and that everything else is a privilege and not a right .
People who voluntarily surrender their freedoms on the altar of personal convenience have no right to complain about it afterwards .
My son is now well on his way to becoming an anarchist .
I wish this toy had been around when I was a child so that we might have learned important life lessons rather than the fluffy sugar - coated false utopia of Rainbow Bright and Friends .
Have you found some good ones ?
Leave a comment with them and the links here and we 'll add them .

Casio Men's CA53W Databank Calculator Watch
Posted by Jonathan on 2012-05-03 10:08:57 CASIO watches are the best thing that has ever invented .
I bought this watch a little less than a month ago and was shocked and awed by the amount of attention I received over it .
Before I bought the CASIO CA53W - 1 Watch with Calculator I was a nothing , I was no one , no one on my campus recognized me .
All of the people I knew were stupid gaming retards , all they cared about was Modern Warfare 2 coming out soon .
They were like " Sean come play Modern Warfare with us , it totally is the best game ever .
Play Modern Warfare to tune your skills for Modern Warfare 2 . " and I told them to get some lotion and go into the bathroom because I was n't playing any more video games , I was becoming a man .
The first thing I did was to sell my xbox 360 and all its accessories on craigslist for $ 150 ( I had a lot of stuff ) , the reason being was that I had an epiphany when they told me to play Modern Warfare with them .
The epiphany is : there will always be new video games coming out , most of them are n't worth your time .
Anyways so I sold my xbox , and then I got a haircut .
Well I got many hairs cut and ended up getting a fashionable haircut like that of Edward Cullen on Twilight .
I figure all the girls love him right ?
They all want to take him into the bathroom without lotion or Maxim , if I look like him , I will get all the babes .
I also got a Bowflex PR3000 Home Gym , now I work out 3 times a week and I am totally ripped ( well at least I 'm ripping ) .
I then purchased this CASIO CA53W - 1 Watch with Calculator , the first girl that talked to me about it was Janet , from my circuit analysis class .
She told me that she liked my watch , that maybe we should hang out sometime .
Janet had always been my dream girl , smart , funny , engineering major , mildly overweight ( but in a good way ) , and she loved CASIO watches .
I mean who does n't right ?
Well I decided that the first girl that talked to me about my watch was going to be the one .
I left circuit analysis class walking next to Janet , my ex-friend Jake from Modern Warfare came up to me and asked if I wanted to play in 20 minutes .
I asked him what 7251 times 8 was , he could n't tell me .
I flashed him my CASIO CA53W - 1 Watch with Calculator and told him to go into the bathroom with some lotion and a copy of Maxim , he knew immediately that he would never talk to me again .
I cannot more highly recommend this watch to anyone , it is comfortable , has a watch , calculator , alarm clock , and most importantly for Janet and I it has a stopwatch .

Brian Williams interviews Tom Brokaw to analyze Scott McClellan 's charges that the press was not aggressive enough on the Bush administration leading up to the Iraq war and called them " complicit enablers .
" You mean us ? " said the media .
Williams :
Are you confident , taking the coverage in total that the right questions were asked , the right tone was employed and should it be viewed in the context to that time ?
Brokaw :
It needs to be viewed in the context of that time ?
Is n't the media supposed to be the watchdog of our leaders at all times so that lies do n't get us into wars and something called the truth is actually being reported ?
Brokaw :
When the President said we 're going to war , that there 's a danger of the mushroom cloud , we know that there 's been experiments with Iraqi nuclear programs in the past .
Honorable people believed he had WMD's ... Look , I think all of us would like to go back and ask questions with the benefit of hindsight ( Yea , we 're just Monday morning quarterbacks now ) of what we know now , but a lot of what was going on was unknowable .
Well , he should have watched Bill Moyers special on the media as a refresher course .
He then blames Congress too .
Yea , they are culpable for their own actions , but NOT for YOUR coverage .
Sorry , Americans are n't buying this spin even from a well respected journalist like Tom .
It 's really sad that he could n't take a critical eye to himself .
The media needs it and I believe only the elder statesmen of the media can say the words to shake them up .
Has n't he witnessed enough of The Chris Matthews effect already ?
I 'll let Glenn Greenwald dissect this at another time .
I 'm working on further deep analysis of their behavior to bring to you shortly .
Apologist jerks --- all of them through and through .
C&Ler Karen emailed me and said she lost all respect for Tom after watching this .
I have lost a lot of respect for Tom Brokaw after this interview .
His perspective on McClellan 's revelations sound like a laundry list of Bushite excuses : Respectable people believed Hussein had WMD ;
We 'd all love to go back in time knowing what we know now ; etc .
Worst , though , was his casual dismissal of the administration 's basing the war on propaganda with , " All wars are based on propaganda . "
Saddened , Karen
I hear your pain , Karen .
Update : And Tom , yes there is propaganda for all wars by all administrations as you say , but are n't you supposed to knock down that spin for the American people ?
Break through that wall of lies .
If not , then WTF is your actual function ?

LEBANON , Maine ( AP ) _
Two teenage girls sunbathing on a railroad trestle lost limbs when a train came upon them unexpectedly in this New Hampshire border town , police said Wednesday .

LEBANON , Maine ( AP ) _
Two teenage girls sunbathing on a railroad trestle lost limbs when a train came upon them unexpectedly in this New Hampshire border town , police said Wednesday .
The girls were lying on beach towels on the trestle over Three Mill Pond when the train rounded a corner and began braking and blasting its horn shortly before 11 a.m. , said Lt. Gary Fecteau of the York County Sheriff 's Department .
The conductor and engineer say they never saw the girls move , but their injuries suggest they tried to scramble away at the last moment , Fecteau said .
Destiny Phaneuf , 13 , of Lebanon , lost her leg just below the knee ; Rachel Brown 14 , also of Lebanon , lost a foot , Fecteau said .
Both were airlifted to Maine Medical Center in Portland .
The girls were cutting class and enjoying the sunny weather when the freight train came upon them , Fecteau said .
There 's no indication the girls were impaired by alcohol or drugs , or that their hearing was impaired by headphones , he said .
Phaneuf was unconscious when authorities arrived ; Brown told police that the pair had fallen asleep while sunbathing , he said .
The train crew called to report the accident when it happened .
Police and rescue workers from Milton , N.H. , were first on the scene .
They turned the investigation over to York County authorities after determining that the incident had happened in Maine .

If , like me , you ’re a lover of espionage films , you might fancy yourself able to spot the typical spy from a mile away .
It ’s usually a white man , native born , who gets into trouble with booze , gambling , or hookers , and to support his habit or break free of his debts , agrees to trade secrets for cash .
He might be military , but could just as easily be civilian .
He does n’t have many foreign connections , least of all to the Russians , that most lucrative of employers , so he tosses a note over an embassy wall or slips a letter under a guarded gate , offering his services to the bad guys .
Picture Sean Penn in “ The Falcon and the Snowman ” or Chris Cooper in “ Breach . ”
That ’s the archetype , and according to an unclassified report ( .pdf ) released last month by the Defense Personnel Security Research Center , which studies the characteristics of American spies , it used to be largely true — that is , until around 1990 .
After the Cold War , the biographical details and motivations of the typical traitor began a dramatic shift , reflecting larger changes in the world ’s political alignment , advances in communications , growth in international travel , and globalization .
A summary of how today ’s spies differ from yesterday ’s , according to the report :
Generally older today than during the Cold War , indicating a “ graying of the American spy ” More educated ; twice as many now hold advanced degrees as during the Cold War More likely to be naturalized citizens with family living abroad , foreign business and professional connections , and foreign cultural ties More commonly civilians — either government employees or private contractors — than members of the uniformed military More likely to hold security clearances , although few held them or were even directly associated with the profession of espionage when they began spying
More likely to volunteer than to be recruited by a foreign intelligence service
No longer spying for Russia , but primarily for Middle Eastern countries , Cuba , and Al Qaeda More often spying for ideological reasons or from a sense of “ divided loyalty ; ” few except payment for their services
More likely to spend time in prison after being caught , but generally serving shorter terms

Hillary Clinton is now complaining that her candidacy has been harmed by sexism .
Interviewed earlier this week by the Washington Post , Sen . Clinton said the polls show that " more people would be reluctant to vote for a woman [ than ] to vote for an African American . "
This gender bias , she grumbled , " rarely gets reported on . "
So a woman who holds degrees from Wellesley and Yale – who has earned millions in the private sector , won two terms in the U.S. Senate , and gathered many more votes than John Edwards , Bill Richardson ...
Socialist Appeal - the Marxist voice of Labour and youth .
An undercover police officer tried to provoke violence at the ' Stop Bush ' demonstration .
These are the allegations made by George Galloway MP .
We publish below his letter to the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
We find his evidence compelling and the allegation disturbing .
Is the British state using provocateurs against us ?
The labour movement will want an answer .
Following his letter to the Home Secretary about police violence at the recent protest against George Bush , George Galloway has today written a further letter naming the undercover police officer who is now known to have deliberately provoked violence at the demonstration .
25 June 2008
Rt Hon Jacqui Smith Home Secretary Urgent
Dear Home Secretary ,
As you may be aware I wrote to Sir Ian Blair and Mayor Johnson calling for an inquiry into the policing of the demonstration against George W Bush on Sunday 15 June in Parliament Square / Whitehall .
I enclose a copy of my letter to him .
I should say I have since been visited by Superintendent Tim Jackson and have given him an account of the basis of my original complaint .
I did tell him , however , that subsequent newspaper revelations may indicate a far more sinister involvement of the police in actual law - breaking on the demonstration which sought to provoke exactly the ugly scenes which eventually ensued .
Since my meeting with the superintendent yesterday this issue has become clearer and obliges me both as a Member of Parliament and as a close witness to these events to write to you as Home Secretary demanding a full inquiry by the government into the extraordinary events and policy decisions surrounding the policing of this demonstration .
You will be aware by now of an article in the Mail on Sunday of 22 June by Yasmin Whittaker - Khan in which she recounts her shock at meeting a man , whom she knew to be a policeman from a previous encounter , who seemed determined to bring about a confrontation between the demonstrators and the police .
This man for at least 30 minutes was stood right next to me at the front of the protest and it is inconceivable that no police photograph will confirm this .
I say this because several police stills cameramen and at least one video cameraman were constantly filming .
I can now confirm that this man was Chris Dreyfus , an inspector in the police .
This man , to my direct knowledge , committed four criminal offences during the 30 minutes or so he stood next to me .
First , he repeatedly chanted the arcane , antiquated Americana , " Kill the pigs ! "
This is a clear incitement to violence , indeed murder .
If a Muslim demonstrator had been chanting it , say , outside the Danish Embassy , he would likely now be in prison .
Secondly , he repeatedly ( crushing me in the process ) attempted to charge the crush barriers and the police line behind them .
Thirdly , he repeatedly exhorted others so to do .
Fourthly , he instructed a young demonstrator on the correct way to uncouple a crush barrier , which was successfully achieved and was subsequently thrown at the police , and was presumably one of the justifications for the deployment of a riot squad which eventually waded in to the protesters .
Home Secretary , there can hardly a more grave indictment of the conduct of the police force in a democratic country than this .
People in the labour movement have often mythologised the state 's use of agents provocateurs throughout my 40 years experience and no doubt long before .
But , to my recollection , we have never caught one red - handed before .
This inspector 's criminal actions must place all the other in themselves legitimate complaints about police tactics in a new light .
I wrote to Sir Ian – and to Mayor Johnson – questioning the competence of the policing on that day .
It now seems that what happened was a deliberate conspiracy to bring about scenes of violent disorder , seen around the world and for purposes on which we can only speculate .
You , however , have clear responsibility to get to the heart of this matter .
I do hope you will begin to do so without delay .
Yours sincerely ,
George Galloway MP

Barking dogs have something to say
The emotion in a dog's bark often seems obvious to us humans .
But new research shows just how clear the message can be , at least to other dogs .
The study is the first concrete evidence that dogs can perceive the difference between barks arising from different situations .
While dog barking is hardly as complex as human language , experts now think it 's clear that dogs are conveying their feelings to humans and other dogs .
" [ Dogs ] express basic emotions , and we have not yet found signs for more complex meanings , like ' this is the postman ' , ' this is the bill collector ' , ' this is the neighbour ' , etc , " says Hungarian co-author Péter Pongrácz , a professor of animal behaviour at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest .
" We might call this functionally referential communication , as we are able to tell what kind of situation could elicit a particular kind of barking , " he says .
In earlier research , Pongrácz 's team found that people could indeed distinguish between different types of barks .
For decades , however , dog experts were stumped about how to show dogs could do the same .
For the new study , published online in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science , Pongrácz and his team found a way to do that .
Listen and learn
The researchers first recruited pet dogs of various breeds from training schools , to serve as listeners .
Next , the scientists made recordings of Hungarian mudis ( herding dogs ) barking in two different situations .
One set of recordings was made when a stranger entered the property where a given dog lived .
The second set was made when the dogs were tethered to a tree and left alone .
Two types of mechanical noise , an electric drill and a refrigerator , were control sounds .
The scientists next fitted each of the listening dogs with a heart rate monitor .
While the sound of all dog barks caused a listening dog's heart rate to jump , hearing a certain type of bark consistently over time stabilised the heart rate .
Even though they could get used to the distress barks , the listening dogs always showed a jump in heart rate when the researchers switched from one type of recorded bark to the other .
This evidence for a change in attentiveness shows that not all barks sound the same to other dogs .
The researchers also think it 's likely that the dogs understand the different contexts producing the barks they hear .
Barking for each other or humans ?
Previously , other researchers thought domesticated dogs barked primarily for our benefit , since neither adult wolves nor feral dogs bark .
" We think barking existed in the ancestor of the dogs , but the present form of variability and abundance of barking is the product of domestication in dogs , " Pongrácz says .
He says that domesticated dogs must have learned how to bark to other domesticated dogs later , as a form of communication additional to visual and scent cues .
Anna Taylor , a UK researcher in the Department of Psychology at the University of Sussex , also studies dogs .
" [ The new study ] gives a convincing demonstration that dogs do indeed perceive acoustic differences between barks recorded in different contexts , " she says .
She adds that the findings will inspire future studies to determine how this ability to decipher barks affects dog behaviour .

About the 12 Step Program
About the 12 Step Program
The Twelve Step programs are well known for their use in recovering from addictive and dysfunctional behaviors .
The first 12 step program began with Alcoholics Anonymous ( A.A. ) in the 1930s and has since grown to be the most widely used approach in dealing not only with recovery from alcoholism , but also from drug abuse and various other addictive and dysfunctional behaviors .
The first book written to cover the 12 step program was titled " Alcoholics Anonymous " , affectionately known as the Big Book by program members .
Following the subsequent extensive growth of twelve step programs for other addictive and dysfunctional behaviors , many additional books were written and recordings and videos were produced .
These cover the steps in greater detail and how people have specifically applied the steps in their lives .
An extensive chronology and background about the history of A.A. has been put together at the silkworth .
net website ( Dr. Silkworth being the physician who authored " The Doctor 's Opinion " in the Big Book ) .
The twelve steps of the program are listed above and on the steps page in generic form .
Other groups who have adopted the 12 steps to address their own particular addictive or dysfunctional behavior have similar ideas , usually with only minor variations .
These steps are meant to be worked sequentially as a process of getting rid of addictive behaviors and should result in a growth in freedom and happiness , as outlined in the Promises .
The general governing approach for A.A. groups was originally laid out in the Twelve Traditions , and they remain the guiding principles for most 12 step groups today .
There is a wealth of further information about 12 Step programs in Wikipedia , including a list of 12 step groups , and also from the numerous links in our directory of recovery related websites .
The Occitan Language , which is also called Languedoc or , is a Romance language , spoken by perhaps 1,500,000 people in the Midi , covering an area known as Occitania .
Occitania is the name given to the area where Occitan , the langue d'oc , was traditionally the first language .
It covers almost half of modern France ( the Midi - the sothern part excluding the Basque Country and the Roussillon which is Catalon speaking ) along with parts of what are now Italy and Spain .
This area is far larger than the modern region of the same name and covers the present day Regions of Limousin , Languedoc - Roussillon , the old Aquitaine , and the southern part of the French Alps .
It encompasses not only cities like Toulouse , Montpellier , Carcassonne , Narbonne , Nîmes , and Béziers but also ones as far spread as Nice , Marseilles , Clermont - Ferrand , Limoges , Pau , and Bordeaux .
The area has a long history of liberty and has always provided refuge to thos suffering persecution .
A few examples are :
Faidits - dispossed Cathars - who were given help during their persecution by crusaders and the Inquisition .
So too the Waldenians and other Religious Dissidents .

Sephardic Jews .
Jews were not persecuted under the The Counts of Toulouse as they were elsewhere in western Christendom , and as they were in the Languedoc after it was annexed to Catholic France in the fourteenth century .
After1492 , Navarre became a refuge for Spanish Jews , persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition and later for Catalonian Jews .

After the Spanish Civil War which ended in 1939 , many Spaniards were welcomed throughout Occitania .
Spanish surnames are still common in many areas .

The Maquis .
The Maquis were resistance fighters who opposed the German occupation of the Midi ( and the earlier puppet Vichy Government ) .
They were widely sheltered and supported , despite the risks , just as the faidits had been 700 years earlier .
This territory has never known political unification , but most of it was ruled by the Counts of Toulouse , or their vassals , in the early Middle Ages .
It is still united by its common language , as well as a large number of cultural similarities food , architecture , attitudes , and way of life .
There is a small independence movement , similar to that supporting independence for Catalonia .
Its flag , based on that of the Counts of Toulouse with the Cross of Toulouse , is shown on the left .
It was drawn up by the independentist PNO ( PartitNacionalista Occitan ) .
It features the Occitan cross and the Felibrige star , yellow on a red background .
The seven armed star is a reference to the seven poets who founded the Felbridge on the 21 May , the day of the Santa Estela ( Holy Star ) .
A favourite French argument against Occitan independence is that the words Occitan and Occitania are modern inventions .
This is not true .
The terms were used by the official administration in the fourteenth century , in such terms as ' lingua occitana ' , ' respublica occitana ' , ' patria linguae occitanae ' and ' Occitania ' .
Another favourite argument relys on the fact that Occitania has never been an independent country .
This is itself arguable , but even if the point is accepted , it is notable that neither were Germany nor Italy before the end of the 19th century .
Neither was India , nor dozens of other countries until the Twentieth .
Shawn Jenkins , a developer who had two projects caught up in the delays , said he was accustomed to piles of paperwork and reams of red tape in getting projects approved .
But he was not prepared to have the water district hold up the projects he was planning .
He changed the projects ’ landscaping , to make it less water dependent , as the board pondered their fate .

“ I think this is a warning for everyone , ” Mr. Jenkins said .
Also in Riverside County , a superior court judge recently stopped a 1,500 - home development project , citing , among others things , a failure to provide substantial evidence of adequate water supply .
In San Luis Obispo County , north of Los Angeles , the City of Pismo Beach was recently denied the right to annex unincorporated land to build a large multipurpose project because , “ the city did n’t have enough water to adequately serve the development , ” said Paul Hood , the executive officer of the commission that approves the annexations and incorporations of cities .
In agriculturally rich Kern County , north of Los Angeles , at least three developers scrapped plans recently to apply for permits , realizing water was going to be an issue .
An official from the county ’s planning department said the developers were the first ever in the county to be stymied by water concerns .
Large - scale housing developments in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties have met a similar fate , officials in those counties said .
Throughout the state , other projects have been suspended or are being revised to accommodate water shortages , and water authorities and cities have increasingly begun to consider holding off on “ will - serve ” letters  promises to developers to provide water  for new projects .
“ The water in our state is not sufficient to add more demand , ” said Lester Snow , the director of the California Department of Water Resources .
“ And that now means that some large development ca n’t go forward .
If we do n’t make changes with water , we are going to have a major economic problem in this state . ”
The words “ crisis ” and “ water ” have gone together in this state since the 49ers traded flecks of gold for food .
But several factors have combined to make the current water crisis more acute than those of recent years .

Investing in the stock market is one of the most accessible and reliable ways to build wealth and generate passive income .
It is statistically possible , to invest $ 100 a month and become a millionaire by the time you turn 65 .
Regardless of when you start and how much money you can invest , there is something for everyone to gain by learning to invest in the stock market .
In this article , I am going to make it as easy as possible for someone brand new to investing to get started .
My goal is to answer common questions like where to start investing , what to invest in , etc .
# 1 – Why Investing is Important
Investing is an essential ingredient if you want to achieve financial success .
It is a proven way to grow your money and let compounding interest work for you .
The S&P 500 Index originally began in 1926 as the “ Composite Index ” comprised of only 90 stocks .
According to historical records , the average annual return since its inception in 1926 through 2018 is approximately 10 % .
The average annual return since adopting 500 stocks into the index in 1957 through 2018 is roughly 8 % ( 7.96 % ) .
— Investopedia
Our study shows that the S&P 500 Historical Return , which is indicative of the Stock Market overall return , is about 9 % .
Without investing , it would be nearly impossible for anyone to break through the $ 1 million milestones just by working hard and saving your money .
Investing and Risks Investing is not risk - free .
Unlike putting money into a savings account or a certificate of deposit , there are risks involved .
You should only invest money that you can afford to lose .
For example , if you owe any money — e.g. , credit card debts , student loans , car loans , etc. — you need to pay these debts off first .
The only exception to this rule is your mortgage .
The good news is the risk of losing your money goes down substantially when you invest for a long time in the market , e.g. , more than five years — so investing is an excellent financial move in the long - term .
# 2 – Getting Started with Investing
Before you jump in , there are a few questions you need to answer to help you start at the right place so you can get to your destination .
1. Do You Need this Money in the Next 5 Years ?
If you need the money you plan to invest within the next 5 years , investing in the stock market is not ideal .
If your time horizon is less than 5 years , you need to save your money and not invest .
Your main goal should be to protect your capital against loss and minimize the impact of inflation .
This means you should be using high - yield savings , high - yield checking , or certificates of deposit for your short - term money .
For instance , saving money for a down payment is a good example of saving for a short - term goal .
2 . What is Your Goal ?
Long - Term Growth vs. Current Income
Do you mainly want your investment to grow in value or do you need monthly income from your investment ?
Long - Term Growth
If your goal is to grow your money , then you should look at retirement accounts like 401 ( k ) or IRA to enjoy some of the advantages .
For example :
401(k ) –
You do n’t have to pay Federal and State Income Taxes on your deposits and your employer may contribute a matching fund , giving you an instant return on investment .
– You do n’t have to pay Federal and State Income Taxes on your deposits and your employer may contribute a matching fund , giving you an instant return on investment .
Traditional IRA – This account gives you income tax deductions similar to 401( k ) .
– This account gives you income tax deductions similar to 401( k ) .
Roth IRA – You pay all the taxes on your deposits , however , your money grow completely tax - free .
You do not have to pay any taxes on the withdrawal .
However , the main disadvantage with these accounts is that you cannot withdraw money until 59 1 / 2 .
If you withdraw before you turn 59 1/2 , you ’ll have to pay a 10 % early withdrawal penalty .
The one exception is you can withdraw the money you deposited into a Roth IRA any time , but not the gain .
For a more in - depth discussion , see the section below : Different Types of Investment Account .
Current Income
If your goal is for your investment to generate cash that you can use every month , then you have to invest your money in a taxable account so have access to the money as needed .
There is no withdrawal restriction with a taxable account ; however , you ’ll be paying short - term capital gains tax on the dividend and interest income at your marginal tax rate .
# 3 – Portfolio Design
So far so good .
Now you know where you want to invest the money , e.g. , 401( k ) , IRA , or taxable account ; and you know why you ’re investing the money .
The next step is to design your portfolio .
Long - Term Growth with an Aggressive Portfolio
For this objective , you want a portfolio that grows in value .
This means focusing on asset classes like Stocks and Real Estate .
For the actual investment itself , you will be using ETFs and REITs ( see below ) .
An example of a well - diversified long - term aggressive portfolio might look something like this :
US Stocks 60 %
International Stocks 30 %
Real Estate 10 %
You could use as little as one ETF for each of the slices , for example :
Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF ( SCHB ) ETF for US Stocks
Vanguard Total International Stock ( VXUS ) ETF for International Stocks
Vanguard Real Estate ETF ( VNQ ) ETF for Real Estate
Based on M1 Finance research tool , this portfolio would have grown 31.88 % in the past 5 years and paid 2.324 % dividend per year .
To make the portfolio a little more stable , you can add Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF ( BND ) and decrease your stocks percentages .
Current Income
For this objective , you want a portfolio that generates income consistently .
This means focusing on asset classes like High - Dividend Stocks , Bonds , and Real Estate .
An example of a well - diversified income portfolio might look something like this :
High - Dividend US Stocks 30 %
High - Dividend International Stocks 20 %
Real Estate 25 %
Bonds 25 %
You could use as little as one ETF for each of the slices , for example :
Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ( VYM ) ETF for High - Dividend US Stocks
Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Fund ( VYMI ) ETF for High - Dividend International Stocks
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ( BND ) ETF for Bonds
Vanguard Real Estate ETF ( VNQ ) ETF for Real Estate
Based on M1 Finance research tool , this portfolio would have grown 15.72 % in the past 5 years and paid 3.423 % dividend per year .
# 4 – How to Set Up an Investing Account
1. Your Employer ’s 401(k ) Plan
The first place to look is your company ’s 401 ( k ) plan , especially if they provide matching contributions .
If they do , you need to invest here first and try to take all the matching you can get .
If your company matches up to 6 % of your salary , then contribute 6 % .
For example , if you make $ 50,000 and your company matches up to 6 % , that ’s $ 3,000 in matching .
In this case , you should plan to contribute at least $ 3,000 per year to your 401 ( k ) plan .
You ’re automatically starting with a 100 % gain on your investment !
Moreover , your contributions will be tax - deductible .
To get started :
Ask your HR or Plan Administrator about starting up your 401( k ) .
They will help you set up an automatic deduction from your paychecks , and most likely , you will have access to a web portal to manage your account .
Inside the portal , choose how your money will be invested — if you do n’t , your money will sit in a cash account not doing much of anything .
For now , invest everything into an S&P 500 Index Fund , a Target Date Fund , or a US Large Cap Fund .
If you have multiple funds to choose from , pick the one with the lowest expense ratio and no other fees .
That ’s it …everything should be on autopilot at this point .
For more information , see What Is a 401( k ) Plan and How Does It Work .
2. Roth IRA
Second , you want to start a Roth IRA account where you can contribute the next $ 6,000 per year .
You contribute after - tax money into your Roth IRA , meaning , you pay taxes on your contributions first … but the significant advantage is that your money grows tax - free !
To get started :
Find a stock brokerage firm .
Personally , I use M1 Finance and TD Ameritrade .
And ask them to help you set up a Roth IRA account .
You can contribute up to $ 6,000 per year into the account .
You can do this all at once , or set up an automatic investment to draw money from your bank account and invest automatically , e.g. , $ 500 a month is a good amount .
Again , I would start with a single S&P 500 Index Fund or ETF with the lowest expense ratio .
A fund is usually better for an automatic investment plan where you can add more money regularly without incurring a trading fee , and an ETF is generally better if you contribute and trade only once a year .
3. Next Place to Invest
If you completed # 1 and # 2 , and still have more money to invest , you can decide between these options :
Max out your 401 ( k ) – if you do n’t have any short - term plan for your money , you can try to contribute the maximum $ 19,500 per year to your 401 ( k ) .
If you ’re in the position to max out both your 401 ( k ) and Roth IRA , you may also want to consider starting a normal investment account and invest there as well .
Save for a Down Payment – if you plan to buy a house within the next five years , you might want to consider saving the excess cash into a high yield savings account and let it accumulate toward your down payment .
4. Next Steps
Once you start to grow your investment accounts , you will want to learn more about investing .
Here are some of the key concepts to learn next .
# 5 – Different Types of Investment Account
As mentioned earlier , there are three different types of investment accounts .
1. Taxable Account
This is similar to a bank account where you can invest your money instead of just saving it .
You can use your money to buy different investments , and you can sell them at any time .
Here , you invest with your after - tax money ( i.e. , there is no tax benefits ) .
When you sell , your gain will be taxed at your ordinary tax rate , unless you held the investment for more than one year .
If you sell at a loss , you can use your loss to offset your investment gains and up to $ 3,000 of your other income .
2. Tax - Deferred Account
Investment accounts like 401( k ) and Traditional IRA are tax - deferred .
Money that goes into the account is tax - deductible in the year the money is added to the account , and your investment grows tax - deferred .
When you reach your eligible withdrawal age at 59½ , you pay the Federal and State Income Taxes at your marginal tax rate when you withdraw the money .
3. Tax - Free Account ( Roth )
Investment accounts like Roth 401( k ) and Roth IRA are tax - free .
You contribute after - tax money into the account ( i.e. , you are taxed on your contributions ) BUT your investment grows tax - free .
You do not have to pay taxes on your withdrawal once you reach your eligible withdrawal age .
For both the tax - deferred and tax - free accounts , there is a 10 % early withdrawal penalty if you withdraw money before the full retirement age .
Which one you choose will depend mainly on your situation .
# 6 – Different Types of Investments
There are three primary types of investments that will allow you to invest in the Stock Market .
As a first time investor , I would recommend that you start with either Exchange - Traded Funds ( ETFs ) and / or Mutual Funds .
For now , avoid investing in individual stocks .
Let me briefly explains how each works :
1. Stocks
Each share represents part ownership in a company .
For example , if you buy 100 shares of AAPL , you ’ll own a tiny part of Apple Inc. ( and I mean microscopically tiny ) .
When you purchase shares , you have to pay the brokerage firm trade commissions ( somewhere around $ 3 to $ 30 per trade ) .
Usually , you ’ll have to pay more if you purchase through a bank or a full - service brokerage firm .
2. Mutual Funds
Each mutual fund is a collection of many stocks .
Throughout the year , the fund manager can buy and sell shares inside the fund on your behalf .
In essence , you buy the underlying stocks and pay for the fund manager ’s services .
When you buy shares of a mutual fund , you could potentially pay up to 4 kinds of fees : ( 1 ) Trade Commission , ( 2 ) Front - end load , ( 3 ) Back - end load ( or redemption fee ) , and ( 4 ) Expense ratio .
The funds that you should invest in are low expense ratio , no load , and no transaction fee mutual funds — meaning you are not paying anything but the expense ratio .
3. ETFs
I believe this is by far , the best investment vehicle .
Similar to mutual funds , an ETF is a collection of many stocks ; however , they trade like a stock throughout the day .
ETFs are generally more tax - efficient than mutual funds due to in - kind redemption mechanism .
Likewise , there is an expense ratio , but it ’s generally lower than a similar mutual fund .
But like stocks , you have to pay a trade commission each time you buy and sell shares .
What ’s Next ?
Read as many books and web sites that you can to learn about investing for beginners .
My caution is to avoid hot tips and hot stock picks .
What you want to learn is how the market works , effects of taxes and expenses on investment performance , asset allocation , risk management , investing for specific goals , etc .

Mr Justice Coleridge
Family breakdown is a " cancer " behind almost every evil affecting the country , a senior judge will declare today .
Mr Justice Coleridge blames youth crime , child abuse , drug addiction and binge - drinking on the " meltdown " of relations between parents and children .
He warns that the collapse of the family unit is a threat to the nation as bad as terrorism , crime , drugs or global warming .
The speech to family lawyers contains a fierce attack on the " neglect " of successive governments .
The 58 - year - old judge , who is married with three grown - up children , will say family breakdown is an epidemic affecting all levels of society from the Royal Family down .
It is " on a scale , depth and breadth which few of us could have imagined even " a decade ago .
It is a never - ending carnival of human misery .
A ceaseless river of human distress .
" I am not saying every broken family produces dysfunctional children but I am saying that almost every dysfunctional child is the product of a broken family . "
The judge , who is in charge of family courts across South - West England , will say he has a duty to speak out .
He will call on the Government to put the family at the top of its agenda , alongside the economy and the war on terror - and make it " rather more important than taking oaths of allegianc " .
His speech will say : " Families are the cells which make up the body of society .
If the cells are unhealthy and undernourished , or at worse cancerous and growing haphazard and out of control , in the end the body succumbs .
" In some of the more heavily populated urban areas , family life is quite frankly in meltdown or completely unrecognisable . . . it is on an epidemic scale .
In some areas of the country family life in the old sense no longer exists . "
Scroll down for more ...
The judge condemns families with a mother and several absentee fathers .
He says : " Single parents often do a fantastic job , but a great many , perhaps through no fault of their own , do not .
" A large number of families now consist of children being brought up by mothers who have children by a number of different fathers , none of whom take any part in their lives or support or upbringing .
" These are not isolated , oneoff cases .
They are part of the stock - in - trade of the family courts . "
Judge Coleridge has spent the past eight years presiding over cases of divorce , children in care and family break - up .
Last year he supervised courtroom attempts to negotiate a voluntary divorce agreement between Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills .
He will say : " Almost all society 's ills can be traced directly to the collapse of family life .
We all know it .
Examine the background of almost every child in the care system or the youth justice system and you will discover a broken family .
" Ditto the drug addict .
Ditto the binge drinker .
Ditto those children who are truanting or who cannot behave at school .
" Scratch the surface of these cases and you invariably find a miserable family , overseen by a dysfunctional and fractured parental relationship - or none at all . "
Calling for action before it is too late , the judge will say family breakdown is as serious as global warming .
" It is as big a threat to our society as terrorism , street crime or drugs , but far more insidious .
It will be more destructive than any economic decline caused by international markets . "
Mr Justice Coleridge says it is too late to help families just by bringing back tax breaks for marriage .
He sets out a five - point plan including more effort to educate parents and children on how to keep families together .
The judge also calls for higher spending on family courts , more court time for family cases and modernisation of the laws on divorce and family break - up .
He will absolve any political party of sole blame for family collapse and point to neglect before Labour 's time in power .
But he accuses the government of " fiddling while Rome burns " and dismisses " highsounding declarations about taking children out of poverty " as insufficient .
Latest figures show marriage rates at a historic low and divorce at a historic high .
Children from single - parent families are far more likely to do badly at school , suffer poor health , fall into crime , drug abuse , heavy drinking and teenage pregnancy .
[ Disclosure : Cards from our partners are reviewed below . ]
There are five main factors that make up your credit score .
Two of them — payment history and your amount of debt account for about 65 % of the points that make up your credit score .
But making payments on time and keeping debt levels low are n’t the only ways to go about improving your credit score .
Here , we will take an in - depth look at another important credit score category : your types of accounts ( or “ credit mix ” ) , which accounts for roughly 10 % of the points in your credit score .
Credit scoring models want to see that you can manage all different types of financing , most notably revolving accounts , like a credit card , and installment accounts , like a mortgage or auto loan .
And , if your goal is to build or keep great credit , you ’ll want to understand how exactly this “ credit mix ” factor works .

Remember , this guide will be most helpful to you if you know how your mix of accounts currently impacts your credit scores .
( You can get a free credit report snapshot , updated every 14 days , at Credit.com .
It will give you a letter grade for each of the factors impacting your scores , including account mix . )
Now , let ’s break this major credit scoring factor down further .
What Is a Revolving Account ?
Revolving accounts are those that have a different payment each month depending on your current balance .
These are accounts that you are not required to pay in full each month .
You have the option to “ revolve ” some or all of the balance to the following month .
Lenders charge you interest on the amount you revolve and this is how they make money .
Some examples of revolving accounts are :
Credit Cards Issued by a Bank or a Credit Union :
These are accounts backed by a major payment network , like Visa , Mastercard , or American Express .
( The network ’s logo generally appears on the front or back of the card . )
These accounts are extremely common because almost all banks and credit unions are able to issue them to their customers .
Remember , credit reports will keep a history of your accounts even if they have been closed .
As such , most consumers have several of these credit card accounts on their credit reports .
Credit Cards Issued by a Retail Store :
These are accounts that are issued by the stores where you like to shop .
These cards are a little different than the previous two types in that you can only use the card at the store that issued it .
Some examples are Macy ’s Credit Card , Target RedCard , Pep Boys Credit Card and a Dillard ’s Card .
There are hundreds of other examples .
Most of us have several of these types of cards , too .
Credit Cards Issued by an Oil Company :
These are accounts that are issued by a petroleum company .
As with retail store accounts these cards can only be used at specific locations , almost always a gas station .
Some examples are Techron ( Texaco and Chevron ) Advantage Card , Exxon - Mobil Smart Card , Shell Card and BP Credit Card .
These cards are also very common and easy to obtain .
Most of us have or have had several of these types of cards .
Home Equity Lines of Credit : Also known as a HELOC , these are loans that allow you to tap into the equity of your home .
These loans are generally easy to obtain from most reputable banks and credit unions .
Since these loans allow you to access a portion of your home ’s equity , the payment is determined by the amount borrowed or used .
These accounts are very common in part because the interest is tax - deductible in most cases .
Check with your tax adviser to see if your account qualifies for a tax deduction .
In case you were wondering , debit cards are not considered credit cards .
They are essentially nothing more than a check in plastic form .
As such they do not report on your credit files and will have no impact , good or bad , to your credit scores .
What Is an Installment Account ?
Installment accounts are those that have a fixed payment for a fixed period of time .
As with revolving accounts , you are not required to pay them in full each month .
You are allowed to make a payment that is going to be the same every month until the loan is paid in full .
Lenders charge you an annual percentage rate ( also know as an APR ) and this is how they make money .
Some examples of installment accounts include :
Auto Loans :
Auto loans are issued by either a bank , a credit union or by a company that specializes in automobile lending .
These accounts are generally paid off over 48 to 60 months but shorter and longer terms are available .
Mortgage Loans : Mortgage loans are issued by either a bank , a credit union or a company that specializes in mortgage lending .
These accounts require the most amount of paperwork during the application process and a good credit score can help you secure a lower interest rate .
A lower interest rate will save you a lot of money over time .
Student Loans :
These loans , obviously , are used to pay for college related expenses such as tuition , room and board .
Most student loans are federal loans issued by the federal government .
Private student loans are issued by banks and other financial institutions .
Student loans are a unique type of loan because most students are taking classes and not working full - time jobs .
As such , the repayment of a student loan generally goes through a process called “ deferment . ”
Deferment essentially allows the student to postpone their payments until several months after they have graduated or stopped going to school .
This gives them the opportunity to secure employment before the loan requires the first payment .
Home Equity Loans :
These are not the same as home equity lines of credit ( aka HELOCs ) .
Although they both allow you access to your home ’s equity , the structure of the loans are not similar .
A home equity loan is a fixed amount of money that you borrow .
Once you take that loan out , your payment is fixed for the duration of the payback period .
A home equity line of credit , conversely , gives you the flexibility of taking out some of or the entire approved amount .
Signature Loans : Signature loans are just what they sound like .
You walk into a bank or credit union and tell them you want to borrow some money and sign a guarantee to pay it back .
You do n’t have to tell the bank what the money is for and you can use it for anything you like including vacations , investments , home improvements or a shopping spree .
Credit Builder Loans : Credit builder loans are offered by some financial institutions .
You put some money down in a savings account , and pay yourself back .
Once it ’s paid back , you gain access to the savings that you put in .
Additionally , you build up a small amount of interest from keeping the money in a savings account .
What Is an Open Account ?
Open accounts are probably the least common of the three account types we ’ll profile .
Also referred to as “ open credit , ” it is a hybrid of installment and revolving credit .
The payment is not the same each month and it ’s usually due in full at the end of each billing cycle .
The consumer satisfies financial responsibility for the account when the bill is paid in full each month .
This cycle can go on as long as the consumer has an account with the service provider .
An account with a utility company is one example of open credit .
A customer with an account for gas or electric service , for example , does n’t know what their payment will be each month .
As you can imagine , electric bills can vary a lot from month to month depending upon the seasons and air conditioner / heater usage , and the customer is responsible for making this varying payment each month .
Most utilities , cellular service , and some gas station cards are other examples of open credit .
But perhaps the most widely known example of an open account is a charge card .
Charge cards look and act like credit cards , but with one key difference :
You ’re expected to pay that balance off in full by the end of the month .
What Is a Tradeline ?
A tradeline is the catch - all for all of the credit accounts appearing on your credit reports .
In other words , every single account on your credit files will fall into one of the categories above — revolving , installment or open — and all of those accounts are tradelines .
Here ’s how different account types , or tradelines , may appear on your credit reports .
Subscriber Citibank American Express Account Number 98003948X 10274562309X Account Type Installment Open Credit Limit $ 750,000 N/A ( High Credit ) $ 37,000 $ 2,000 Minimum Monthly Payment ( Terms ) $ 2,000 N/ A Date Opened August , 1998 July , 2004 Date of Status March , 2016 March , 2016 Last Payment Date February , 2016 February , 2016 Loan Type Mortgage Credit Card , Terms OPEN Current Status I1 O1
Why Does Your Mix of Accounts Matter ?
When these accounts report on your credit records they are coded very specifically so that not only consumers and lenders but also credit scoring models can easily identify them .
Statistical analysis has determined that the type of accounts you have is predictive of your future credit risk .
So what does all of this mean to you the consumer ?
Consumers with the strongest credit scores , including FICO credit scores , tend to have a mix of different types of accounts .
Of course , the key is to manage these accounts responsibly .
Credit scoring models are looking to see if you can handle all different types of financing as they assess your creditworthiness .
Keep in mind , all of the accounts on your credit reports count , even if they are closed .
Most of us have had several credit cards , mortgages , auto loans and student loans in our life so this example is probably very realistic .
There really is n’t one target “ sweet spot ” that we should all aim for in our account mix .
That ’s because your mix of accounts might be great for your score but terrible for someone else ’s and vice versa .
How Can You Earn the Maximum Points for the Types of Accounts Category ?
Before you try to make any changes , be sure you have checked your free credit score from Credit.com to see whether this category is bringing your scores down .
If it ’s not , do n’t worry about it .
But if it is , then you may want to consider the following strategies :
If you do n’t have an installment loan reported on your credit reports , consider whether it makes sense to get one .
If you are going to borrow anyway – or if you want to consolidate higher - rate credit card debt – a personal installment loan may be helpful here .
Another strategy is to get a low - rate car loan then pay it off as quickly as you can .
( It will still count even if you pay it off a few months after you get it . )
You can shop for a personal loan here or find credit unions offering auto loans nationwide here .
Avoid finance companies .
Finance companies are commonly referred to as “ lenders of last resort . ”
Their rates and terms are not as favorable as those offered by banks and credit unions so higher risk consumers tend to depend on them for their credit needs .
As such , having a finance company account on your credit report could cost you points .
If you do n’t have any credit cards that are currently open and active , consider getting one .
A credit card that ’s paid on time and has a low ( or no ) balance can be a very valuable credit reference .
If your credit scores are poor you may need to consider a secured credit card to get started .
You can shop for credit cards by credit score here .
Remember , you do n’t want to take on financing you do n’t actually need — or , more importantly , wo n’t be able to repay — just to beef up your account mix .
The best way to score big points in this category is to add installment , revolving and open accounts to your credit file organically over - time .
As you add new loans , be sure to keep track of due dates and watch your debt levels .
Remember , you ’ll still want to keep your payment history and your credit utilization in tact .

NEW YORK , June 6 ( Reuters ) - U.S. heating oil futures trading was halted briefly on the electronic trading platform CME Globex Friday after they struck the maximum fluctuation limit of 25 cents , a NYMEX spokeswoman said .
“ The trading on heating oil was halted at 1:13 p.m. EDT and resumed some three minutes or so later , ” said Anu Aluwahlia , the NYMEX spokeswoman .
NYMEX trading on the floor was not affected , she said .
Traders were confused and some said they did not even know that a trading halt had been imposed .
Current rules on floor trading call for a trading halt for five minutes if a contract hits the fluctuation limit and trades continuously at or above that level for five minutes .
Aluwahlia said that the resumption of heating oil trading after the brief pause called for the doubling of the fluctuation , to 50 cents , which must be hit before another trading halt is called .
Aluwahlia said that NYMEX rules also called for other energy contracts --- crude and RBOB gasoline -- to have their maximum fluctuation doubled after the heating oil hit its maximum .
“ The rules call for all those three contracts -- crude , heating oil and gasoline -- to have their maximum fluctuations doubled after any one of them hits the limit , ” she said .
The fluctuation limit for crude now stands at $ 20 and for RBOB gasoline to 50 cents , she said .
At 1:48 p.m. EDT /1748 GMT , NYMEX July heating oil xHON8 traded at $ 3.9321 a gallon , up 25.13 cents , or 6.82 percent , after trading from $ 3.68 to $ 3.9550 .
NYMEX heating oil hit a record $ 4.0153 on May 22 .
( Reporting by Gene Ramos ; Editing by Christian Wiessner )
Although crime statistics point to the fact that law - and - order issues are actually less of a problem now than in the past , the general public 's perception remains one convinced that muggery and thievery hides behind every street corner .
Politicans and the media stoke these fears , and we get hastily made laws and policies enacted as a result .
Over in the UK , the trend over the past two decades has been to abrogate day - to - day policing of the streets to an army of CCTV cameras .
Soon , if scientists have their way , the cameras will be able to train their focus on suspicious sounds automatically with new AI technology .
Researchers from the University of Portsmouth in the UK are working on refining AI software that currently allows the cameras to identify visual patterns associated with law - breaking .
The plan is to add an audio capability , so that the noise of breaking glass ( for example ) would cause the camera to take notice and alert an operator .
Eventually it is hoped that the AI software would be even more sensitive , according to Dr David Brown , one of the researchers , speaking to the BBC : " Later versions will get cleverer as time goes on , perhaps eventually being able to identify specific words being said or violent sounds . "
I 'm not so sure I like the sound of that .
We 've already covered the ineffectual nature of CCTV cameras in crime fighting , and I 'm just paranoid enough that I do n't like the idea of cameras that could pick up on target words and film people at will .
Not that such concerns over civil liberties seem to be shared by the current UK government , whose 11 years in power have done a fine job of shedding the human rights credentials they wore so proudly during so many years in the wilderness of opposition .
Not that such fears are all that ill - founded ; there are growing concerns that some local councils have been making inappropriate use of their CCTV systems .
According to the BBC , local governments in the South of the UK have been taking advantage of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) to spy on their citizens for a host of reasons , including benefit fraud , dog fouling , and illegal taxi operations .
It was even used by one overzealous local authority to monitor the movements of a family so the council could determine whether their children truly did live in the catchment area for their school .
Thankfully for us paranoid , pro-civil liberties types , Dr. Brown 's work is still only in the realm of academic research .
The grant , funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council — analogous to the NSF in the US — will run for three years .
The successful implementation of such a system might prove quite popular with repressive or authoritarian regimes across the world though , since plastering the streets with such devices is even easier than employing an army of secret police to write things down about their neighbors .
Brave new world indeed .

Last week I wrote about the premise of Oxford professor Jonathan Zittrain ’s new book , The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It ( Yale University Press ) .
He warns about a future of “ tethered ” technologies like the digital video recorder and smartphones that often are programmed remotely by the companies that make them rather than being programmed by users , as PCs are .
As a partial solution , Zittrain offers up the idea of Wikipedia - style communities , where users create their own services without being “ tethered ” to a company that can change the rules any time .
Unfortunately , crowds of people running Web services or technologies online cannot save us from the problem of tethered technology .
Indeed , Zittrain ’s crowds might even unwittingly be tightening the stranglehold of tethering by lulling us into a false sense of freedom .
It ’s actually in the best interest of companies like Apple , Comcast , or News Corp to encourage democratic , freewheeling enclaves like Wikipedia or MySpace to convince people that their whole lives are n’t defined by tethering .
When you get sick of corporate - mandated content and software , you can visit Wikipedia or MySpace .
If you want a DVR that ca n’t be reprogrammed by Comcast at any time , you can look up how to build your own software TV tuner on Wikipedia .
See ?
You have freedom !
Unfortunately , your homemade DVR software does n’t have the kind of easy - to - use features that make it viable for most consumers .
At the same time , it does prove that tethered technologies are n’t your only option .
Because there ’s this little puddle of freedom in the desert of technology tethering , crowd - loving liberals are placated while the majority of consumers are tied down by corporate - controlled gadgets .
In this way , a democratic project like Wikipedia becomes a kind of theoretical freedom – similar to the way in which the US constitutional right to freedom of speech is theoretical for most people .
Sure , you can write almost anything you want .
But will you be able to publish it ?
Will you be able to get a high enough ranking on Google to be findable when people search your topic ?
Probably not .
So your speech is free , but nobody can hear it .
Yes , it is a real freedom .
Yes , real people participate in it and provide a model to others .
And sometimes it can make a huge difference .
But most of the time , people whose free speech flies in the face of conventional wisdom or corporate plans do n’t have much of an effect on mainstream society .
What I ’m trying to say is that Wikipedia and “ good crowds ” ca n’t fight the forces of corporate tethering – just as one person ’s self - published , free - speechy essay online can’t fix giant , complicated social problems .
At best , such efforts can create lively subcultures where a few lucky or smart people will find that they have total control over their gadgets and can do really neat things with them .
But if the denizens of that subculture want millions of people to do neat things too , they have to deal with Comcast .
And Comcast will probably say , “ Hell no , but we ’re not taking away your freedom entirely because look , we have this special area for you and 20 other people to do complicated things with your DVRs . ”
If you ’re lucky , Comcast will rip off the subculture ’s idea and turn it into a tethered application .
So what is the solution , if it is n’t nice crowds of people creating their own content and building their own tether - free DVRs ?
My honest answer is that we need organized crowds of people systematically and concertedly breaking the tethers on consumer technology .
Yes , we need safe spaces like Wikipedia , but we also need to be affirmatively making things uncomfortable for the companies that keep us tethered .
We need to build technologies that set Comcast DVRs free , that let people run any applications they want on iPhones , that fool ISPs into running peer - to - peer traffic .
We need to hand out easy - to - use tools to everyone so crowds of consumers can control what happens to their technologies .
In short , we need to disobey .

Mike Allen interviews President George W. Bush .
| Robert A. Reeder Bush warns of Iraq disaster
President Bush warned in an interview Tuesday that the Democratic presidential candidates ' plans to withdraw abruptly from Iraq could " eventually lead to another attack on the United States " and would " embolden " terrorists .
In a White House interview with Politico and Yahoo News — a president 's first for an online audience — Bush said his doomsday scenario for a premature withdrawal “ of course is that extremists throughout the Middle East would be emboldened , which would eventually lead to another attack on the United States . "

" The United States pulling out of Iraq or pulling out of the Middle East or not maintaining a forward presence would send all kinds of signals throughout the Middle East , " he said in the Roosevelt Room .
" And it would shake everybody 's nerves , and it would embolden the very same people that we 're trying to defeat .
For the first time , Bush revealed a personal way in which he has tried to acknowledge the sacrifice of soldiers and their families .
“ I do n't want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf , ” he said .
“ I feel I owe it to the families to be in solidarity as best as I can with them .
And I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal . ”
Bush said he made that decision after the August 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad , which killed Sergio Vieira de Mello , the top U.N. official in Iraq and the organization ’s high commissioner for human rights .
“ I remember when de Mello , who was at the U.N. , got killed in Baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good man 's life , ” he said .
“ I was playing golf — I think I was in central Texas — and they pulled me off the golf course and I said , ‘ It 's just not worth it anymore to do . ’"
In a reversal of the usual question that ’s put to him , a query submitted online asked the president whether he felt he had been misled about Iraq as he made the decision to go to war .
“ ‘ Misled ’ is a strong word , it almost connotes some kind of intentional , ” Bush said .
“ I do n't think so .
…
Intelligence communities all across the world shared the same assessment .
And so I was disappointed to see how flawed our intelligence was . ”
Congress has since pushed , and Bush has signed , various intelligence reforms , including the creation of a director of national intelligence , whose job it is to help the various parts of the intelligence community share information .
“ Do I think somebody lied to me ? ” he said .
“ No , I do n't .
I think it was just , you know , they analyzed the situation and came up with the wrong conclusion . ”
On other topics :
— The president said global warming has “ been more clearly defined as a problem ” during his eight years in office , and when asked if it is real , Bush said : “ Yes , it is real ; sure is . ”
“ I could have supported a lousy [ Kyoto ] treaty and everybody would have went , ‘ Oh , man , what a wonderful - sounding fellow he is , ’ ” Bush said .
“ But it just would n't have worked .
“ I do n't think you want your president trying to be the cool guy and not end up with policies that actually make a difference .
So the policies I 've outlined are policies that will actually make a difference : nuclear power for generating electricity , battery driven cars , ethanol . ”
— Asked a question that was submitted online about skyrocketing gas prices , Bush said the problem does n’t have “ a quick answer . ”
“ It took us a while to get to where we are — very dependent on oil , ” he said .
“ So my answer ... is that the best thing we can do is to increase supply and to drill for oil and gas in environmentally friendly ways at home and build more refineries . ”
Bush continued to hedge on whether he would support the federal gas tax holiday being pushed by Sens.
Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) and John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) in their respective presidential campaigns .
“ I 'll consider it , ” he said .
“ There 's all kinds of ideas . …
The truth of the matter is that in order for there to be a substantial change , either consumers have to change their habits … or there has to be an increase of supply . "
— As he prepared to head out Tuesday night for a trip to Israel , Egypt and Saudi Arabia , he said Americans should be concerned about incremental progress in the Middle East , even though a grand peace between Israelis and Palestinians continues to look distant . ”
“ Americans at home ought to care for the advance of free societies throughout the Middle East .
After all , this is the center of anti-Americanism and hatred , ” he said .
“ The big challenge in the 21st century is to advance freedom in the Middle East for our security . ”
— Congress is “ stalled ” after 18 months of Democratic leadership .
“ I 've laid out a very aggressive agenda … and there has n't been much action , ” he said .
“ We got a housing crisis , and I proposed a reasonable set of reforms .
And so I would call them stalled .
I would call them , so far , good at verbiage and not so good at results . ”
— He criticized former President Jimmy Carter for suggesting an approach to Middle East involvement that Bush described as “ if you want to be popular in the Middle East , just go blame Israel for every problem . ”
“ That will make you popular , ” he said .
“ Popularity is fleeting .
… Principles are forever . ”
— He ’s not concerned about ugly racial debate if Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) is the presidential nominee .
“ I think most Americans are open - minded people , and they 're going to pick the president who can keep America safe and keep taxes low , ” he said .
“ My own judgment is … that race will only enter in if it 's provoked by the press . ”
— While offering earthquake aid to Hu Jintao , the president said he urged the Chinese leader to pressure the junta of cyclone - stricken Myanmar , the former Burma , to be more open to Western aid .
“ I told President Hu Jintao today , of China , if you get — if you 're in touch with the Burmese , tell them that we 're genuine in our efforts to want to help , ” Bush said .
“ We 've been disappointed by the response .
It 's taken these people too long to move .
It 's almost as if they 're in a state of denial .
But we 'll see .
We 're beginning to make some progress there in terms of getting our aid in . ”
— This past weekend ’s wedding of his daughter Jenna to Henry Hager at the Bush family 's Crawford , Texas , ranch “ went exactly the way she hoped it would go , ” Bush said .
“ I was thinking , ' This is one beautiful bride , and Henry is a lucky man , ' ” he said .
Bush said his toast “ was to the families and friends that were there ; the toast was to the Hagers in raising a good man in Henry ; the toast was to my beautiful girl . ”
Ahead of the wedding Bush watched the Steve Martin comedy “ Father of the Bride . ”
He said the lesson he took from the movie was : “ Write the check and be happy . ”
— In January he plans to return to e-mail , which he gave up when he took office to avoid leaks .
He said he looks forward to “ e- mailing to my buddies , ” and said he was a heavy e-mailer in Texas .
“ I can remember , as governor , I stayed in touch with all kinds of people around the country , firing off e-mails at all times of the day to stay in touch with my pals , ” he said .
“ One of the things that I will have ended my public service time with is a group of friends , a lot of friends .
And I want to stay in touch with them , and there 's no better way to communicate with them than through e-mail . ”
— His Christian faith has increased in office , since “ part of the faith walk is to understand your weaknesses and is to constantly try to embetter yourself and get closer to the Lord , and that 's a daily occurrence . ”
“ Obviously , there 's been some tough moments in here , ” he said .
“ When you know that somebody lost their loved one as a result of a decision that I made , that 's a tough moment .
If you 're a faithful person , you try to empathize with the suffering that that person is going through .
On the other hand , there is a knowledge that the good Lord can comfort during these moments of grief .
And that 's what I ask for in my prayer . ”
— Perhaps tellingly after a rough seven and a half years , the president said one of his happiest moments in the Oval Office came the day he took office .
“ My dad was upstairs at the White House preparing for the inaugural balls , ” he recalled .
“ And I said to him : ' Let 's go on over to the Oval Office ' — I had n't been in the Oval Office as president yet .
And so I came over here before he got here , and he walked through that door right there and it was a happy moment to see my dad come in the Oval Office .
I love him dearly . ”
Asked if his father is proud of him , the president said : “ Oh , yes , no question he is .
And I 'm proud of him . …
[ H ] e's sitting there complaining about this editorial or that — I said , man , I do n't even pay attention to it , because I do n't .
But , yes , he 's very proud of me , you can imagine — and proud of Jeb and he 's proud of all his children for different reasons . ”
— On who does the better impression , Will Ferrell of him or Dana Carvey of his father , he had a quick answer : “ Dana Carvey . ”
Great .
So this is what the American taxpayer is funding ?
So we are helping prop up another failed CEO as the company he led into ruin fires 7,000 people , probably more .
Sounds pretty fair , does n’t it ?
The “ rainmaker ” as they are calling him , is somehow a hot commodity on the market which gives you an idea just how bad the market is these days .
If JP Morgan or anyone else wants to pay this guy , fine , but let ’s stop funding these clowns and helping them maintain a luxurious lifestyle while everyone is struggling .
Who out there would n’t like a nice government sponsored handout to live the life of Riley ?
Let JP
Morgan or whoever else go find their own money without the help of taxpayers but as long as they have their hands out for a free ride , there is no reason why we ought to condone such a hire .
Posted by Prof. Goose on June 3 , 2008 - 8:00 am
This post was inspired by a post over at Paul Kedrosky 's place entitled Fun with Fuel Subsidies , in which he put up these two graphics and said " Discuss . "
Now I am doing the same here .
Two figures ( via the Economist and FT , respectively , click graphics to go the stories -- at FT click the " view map " in the graphic once you get there to see the interactive map that this picture was taken from ) that show the world of fuel subsidies worldwide :
Mohammed Atef was furious .
The Al Qaeda leader had learned that a subordinate had broken the rules repeatedly .
So he did his duty as the feared military chief of a global terror network :
He fired off a nasty memo .
In two pages mixing flowery religious terms with itemized complaints , the Egyptian boss accused the militant of misappropriating cash , a car , sick leave , research papers and an air conditioner during “ an austerity situation ” for the network .
He demanded a detailed letter of explanation .
“ I was very upset by what you did , ” Atef wrote .
“ I obtained 75,000 rupees for you and your family ’s trip to Egypt .
I learned that you did not submit the voucher to the accountant , and that you made reservations for 40,000 rupees and kept the remainder claiming you have a right to do so .
. . .
Also with respect to the air - conditioning unit , . . . furniture used by brothers in Al Qaeda is not considered private property .
. . .
I would like to remind you and myself of the punishment for any violation . ”
Advertisement
The memo by Atef , who later died in the U.S. - led assault on Osama bin Laden ’s Afghan refuge in 2001 , is among recently declassified documents that reveal a little - known side of the network .
Although Al Qaeda has endured thanks to a loose and flexible structure , its internal culture has nonetheless been surprisingly bureaucratic and persistently fractious , investigators and experts say .
The documents were captured in Afghanistan and Iraq and date from the early 1990s to the present .
They depict an organization obsessed with paperwork and penny - pinching and afflicted with a damaging propensity for feuds .
“ The picture of internal strife that emerges from the documents highlights not only Al Qaeda ’s past failures but also -- and more importantly -- it offers insight into its present weaknesses , ” concludes a study of the documents issued in September by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point .
“ Al Qaeda today is beset by challenges that surfaced in leadership disputes at the beginning of the organization ’s history . ”
In the years after 2001 , anti-terrorism officials worked to understand a foe that defied a Western mind - set .
In contrast to state - sponsored extremist groups , Al Qaeda was a decentralized alliance of networks .
Recruits in Afghanistan had access to Bin Laden and other bosses .
Operatives were often given great autonomy .
Advertisement
But the egalitarian veneer coexisted with the bureaucratic mentality of the chiefs , mostly Egyptians with experience in the military and highly structured extremist groups .
“ They may have imposed the blindingly obdurate nature of Egyptian bureaucracy , ” said a senior British anti-terrorism official who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons .
“ You see that in the retirement packages they offered , the lists of members in Iraq , the insecure attitude about their membership , the rifts among leaders and factions . ”
Like newly arrived fighters in Iraq today , recruits in the 1990s filled out applications that were kept in meticulous rosters .
The shaggy , battle - scarred holy warriors of Afghanistan were micromanagers .
They scrupulously documented logistical details -- one memo accounts for a mislaid Kalashnikov rifle and 125 rounds of ammunition .
They groused and nagged about money .
In a brief letter from the late 1990s , a militant wished Atef “ Peace and God ’s mercy and blessings ” and “ praise to the Lord and salvation to his prophet . ”
Then he got down to business : “ I have not received my salary in three months and I am six months behind in paying my rent .
. . .
You also told me to remind you , and this is a reminder . ”
Advertisement
A stern Egyptian bean - counter set the austere policies .
Mustafa Ahmed Al Yahzid , a 52 - year - old trained as an accountant , ran the network ’s finance committee between 1995 and 2007 , said Rohan Gunaratna , author of “ Inside Al Qaeda . ”
“ He is known as being a very stringent administrator , who keeps tight control of Al Qaeda ’s finances , ” Gunaratna said .
Committees and titles proliferated .
And for years , schisms pitted Bin Laden ’s inner circle against factions who saw him as a chaotic commander prone to military miscalculation .
They also faulted him and his deputies for disdain toward non-Arabs , a persistent point of conflict , according to the West Point study .
Dissent was loud .
Two influential Syrians scolded Bin Laden “ like a disobedient child ” in an e-mail in 1999 , the study says .
They urged him to end tensions with Mullah Omar , the Taliban chief .
Advertisement
“ I think our brother [ Bin Laden ] has caught the disease of screens , flashes , fans and applause , ” the Syrians wrote .
“ You should apologize for any inconvenience or pressure you have caused . ”
The documents also suggest a vexing struggle to retain operational control in recent years .
Iraq is the best example .
The rise of Al Qaeda in Iraq under Abu Musab Zarqawi attracted new fighters and funds .
But the fiery Jordanian had kept his distance even when he ran his own Afghan training camp .
As he gained the spotlight in Iraq , he feuded with the core leadership in Pakistan , who worried that his onslaught of bombings and beheadings would backfire .
Their efforts to rein in Zarqawi are documented by a letter from a Libyan chief known only as Atiyah .
U.S. troops found the 13 - page letter in the safe house where an airstrike killed Zarqawi in 2006 .
Atiyah sounds like a sage veteran alternately chiding and praising a rookie hothead as he urges Zarqawi to mend fences with Bin Laden and refrain from indiscriminate violence .
Advertisement
“ My dear brother , today you are a man of the public , ” Atiyah wrote from Pakistan on July 9 , 2005 .
“ Your actions , decisions and behavior result in gains and losses that are not yours alone , but rather they are for Islam . ”
As predicted , Zarqawi ’s rampage had weakened Al Qaeda in Iraq by the time he died .
In the aftermath , the leadership in Pakistan lost a chief who was captured en route to Iraq on a mission to take charge there .
Atiyah ’s advice describing the fall of Algerian Islamic movements a decade ago remains relevant , experts said .
“ They destroyed themselves with their own hands , ” Atiyah wrote to Zarqawi .
“ Their enemy did not defeat them , but rather they defeated themselves . ”

England 's green and pleasant land is in catastrophic decline , with some of its most precious wildlife at risk of disappearing for ever , the first comprehensive report into the nation 's natural life has shown .
In a landmark study into every aspect of the environment , the government advisory body Natural England has compiled research from all corners of the countryside , from woodland and wetland to marine life and salt marsh .
Its findings make for bleak reading .
Under siege from climate change , development , pollution and aggressive new farming methods , the country 's biodiversity is already significantly less rich than it was 50 years ago , The State of The Environment report said .
Just 3 per cent of grassland is rich in native plants and a fifth of the countryside is already showing visible signs of neglect , it reported .
The collapse of this habitat is having such a devastating effect on native species , including the red squirrel , the turtle dove , the bumblebee and the adder .

" If we do n't act now , there 's a real danger some of our most precious wildlife will be lost for ever and our lives will be poorer for it " , said Helen Phillips , chief executive of Natural England .
Conservation charities echoed her appeal , saying they hoped the report would be a springboard for government action .
" This is a timely and hard - hitting call which the Government must heed and act upon , " said Sue Armstrong Brown , the RSPB 's head of countryside conservation .
" We are now seeing the consequences of decades of ignoring environmental limits .
Now , with the climate changing and wildlife crashing worldwide , it is time for a new green leadership .
There has never been a time when human action has put so much wildlife in peril .
The Government should support Natural England 's plans and allocate enough money to put them into place . "
The report makes clear that , with government commitment , the gradual decline could be combated and even reversed .
Its authors are urging action on a series of recommendations which they say could save the natural environment from destruction .
" England needs a new approach to conservation if we are to effectively tackle the modern pressures on land created by climate change and development , " said Ms Phillips .
" We need to find ways to manage our landscape to create a mosaic of uses so that we can help our wildlife survive – be it through new ' national park ' around the length of England 's coastline , better use of the green belt or improved use of public funding for farmers to deliver a better natural environment . "
There are already signs that , with the right level of focus and funding , these schemes can work , with the notable success stories of reintroduced species such as the red kite , the large blue butterfly and the pool frog cited as evidence for the merit of long - term projects .
Numbers of native woodland butterflies species have declined by 50 per cent in 10 years , and their demise is all the more worrying as they are an indicator group – meaning that , as they respond quickly to changes in their environment , they act as a litmus test for the health of the natural world .
Natural England has suggested that a return to traditional woodland management might tackle the fall in numbers .
By using coppicing – the regular culling of smaller trees – the flowering plants they rely upon will be given the chance to thrive again .
The management of wetlands and salt marshes has also been analysed in the report , where native species are suffering similarly catastrophic falls .
A major decline in wading birds native to unprotected wetlands has been identified , with , for example , the number of snipes down by 90 per cent .
Agricultural and urban development has drained the soil in some areas , leaving it too dry for them to survive .
However , by preventing further drainage , and reinstating raised water levels , this trend can be reversed .
Natural England has drawn up a manifesto of measures that it believes can change the fate of the countryside .
It hasput tackling climate change at the top of its spending agenda for the £ 2.9bn of public money allocated to its cause .
To carry this out , it plans to prioritise locking - in carbon , absorbing excess rainwater to prevent flooding and connecting wildlife sites .
It will also be helping the Government find space for renewable energy by publishing a map of suitable locations for onshore wind farms .
Another key element of itscarbon plan is improved maintenance of upland areas , 29 per cent of which are now in an unfavourable condition .
Peat – indigenous to such areas – absorbs more than half of the UK 's carbon .
But its properties are lost when it dries out , so Natural England has suggested avoiding upland draining and over - grazing in the regions to which it is native .
The Environment Secretary , Hilary Benn , said he believed the right measures , such as the planned investment of £ 2.9bn in agri-environment schemes over the next five years , could make a difference .
" We also now recognise that climate change is presenting us with a new challenge in conserving biodiversity and managing our landscapes , " he said .
" We need new approaches to conservation , and we are working closely with Natural England to develop these . "
But this has done little to reassure environmental campaign groups such as Friends of the Earth , who want a more fundamental overhaul of government policy .
The group 's campaigns co-ordinator , Paul de Zylva , said : " The Government must do more to safeguard our future .
Green speeches are not enough – we need urgent action .
" Ministers must put the environment at the heart of all their policies – including transport , the economy , housing and planning – and invest in clean , green solutions that would make Britain a world leader in developing a low - carbon economy . "
The key areas
* Woodland
Butterflies have declined by 50 per cent .
The problem is particularly acute in the south of England .
What can be done ?
Bring back traditional coppicing , regular felling of smaller trees to create open ground for flowers that butterflies rely on .
* Wetland
The snipe population is down 90 per cent in the Midlands and the South .
Its habitat has been destroyed by over - draining from agriculture and construction .
What can be done ?
Stop further drainage and restore water levels .
* Salt marsh
This is disappearing at an annual rate of 1 per cent , partly as walls are built to combat rising sea levels .
Cord - grass is now found in only three sites in England .
What can be done ?
" Managed retreat " , where breaks are made in sea defences to let some land flood naturally .
* Arable
Monocultures and industrial farming have affected native species such as the cornflower .
In 1960 there were 263 areas of 10 sq km with cornflowers .
By 1985 it was less than 10 .
Now there is only one self - sustaining wild population .
What can be done ?
As the flowers traditionally grow around cereal fields , a return to simpler cultivation practices , using lower chemical inputs and not cultivating to the edges , would give them a chance to thrive .
* Marine
Aggressive fishing is affecting not only fish stocks but also other marine life , such as the
pink sea fan , which is threatened by scallop dredging .
What can be done ?
More sustainable fisheries management and an end to destructive dredging methods .
* Uplands
The drying of blanket bog could be catastrophic to the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere .
What can be done ?
Reduce overgrazing , inappropriate burning and drainage .
Five years on , and still we have not learnt .
With each anniversary , the steps crumble beneath our feet , the stones ever more cracked , the sand ever finer .
Five years of catastrophe in Iraq and I think of Churchill , who in the end called Palestine a " hell - disaster " .
But we have used these parallels before and they have drifted away in the Tigris breeze .
Iraq is swamped in blood .
Yet what is the state of our remorse ?
Why , we will have a public inquiry – but not yet !
If only inadequacy was our only sin .
Today , we are engaged in a fruitless debate .
What went wrong ?
How did the people – the senatus populusque Romanus of our modern world – not rise up in rebellion when told the lies about weapons of mass destruction , about Saddam 's links with Osama bin Laden and 11 September ?
How did we let it happen ?
And how come we did n't plan for the aftermath of war ?

Oh , the British tried to get the Americans to listen , Downing Street now tells us .
We really , honestly did try , before we absolutely and completely knew it was right to embark on this illegal war .
There is now a vast literature on the Iraq debacle and there are precedents for post - war planning – of which more later – but this is not the point .
Our predicament in Iraq is on an infinitely more terrible scale .
As the Americans came storming up Iraq in 2003 , their cruise missiles hissing through the sandstorm towards a hundred Iraqi towns and cities , I would sit in my filthy room in the Baghdad Palestine Hotel , unable to sleep for the thunder of explosions , and root through the books I 'd brought to fill the dark , dangerous hours .
Tolstoy 's War and Peace reminded me how conflict can be described with sensitivity and grace and horror – I recommend the Battle of Borodino – along with a file of newspaper clippings .
In this little folder , there was a long rant by Pat Buchanan , written five months earlier ; and still , today I feel its power and its prescience and its absolute historical honesty : " With our MacArthur Regency in Baghdad , Pax Americana will reach apogee .
But then the tide recedes , for the one endeavour at which Islamic people excel is expelling imperial powers by terror or guerrilla war .
" They drove the Brits out of Palestine and Aden , the French out of Algeria , the Russians out of Afghanistan , the Americans out of Somalia and Beirut , the Israelis out of Lebanon .
We have started up the road to empire and over the next hill we will meet those who went before .
The only lesson we learn from history is that we do not learn from history . "
How easily the little men took us into the inferno , with no knowledge or , at least , interest in history .
None of them read of the 1920 Iraqi insurgency against British occupation , nor of Churchill 's brusque and brutal settlement of Iraq the following year .
On our historical radars , not even Crassus appeared , the wealthiest Roman general of all , who demanded an emperorship after conquering Macedonia – " Mission Accomplished " – and vengefully set forth to destroy Mesopotamia .
At a spot in the desert near the Euphrates river , the Parthians – ancestors of present day Iraqi insurgents – annihilated the legions , chopped off Crassus 's head and sent it back to Rome filled with gold .
Today , they would have videotaped his beheading .
To their monumental hubris , these little men who took us to war five years ago now prove that they have learnt nothing .
Anthony Blair – as we should always have called this small town lawyer – should be facing trial for his mendacity .
Instead , he now presumes to bring peace to an Arab - Israeli conflict which he has done so much to exacerbate .
And now we have the man who changed his mind on the legality of war – and did so on a single sheet of A4 paper – daring to suggest that we should test immigrants for British citizenship .
Question 1 , I contend , should be : Which blood - soaked British attorney general helped to send 176 British soldiers to their deaths for a lie ?
Question 2 : How did he get away with it ?
But in a sense , the facile , dumbo nature of Lord Goldsmith 's proposal is a clue to the whole transitory , cardboard structure of our decision - making .
The great issues that face us – be they Iraq or Afghanistan , the US economy or global warming , planned invasions or " terrorism " – are discussed not according to serious political timetables but around television schedules and press conferences .
Will the first air raids on Iraq hit prime - time television in the States ?
Mercifully , yes .
Will the first US troops in Baghdad appear on the breakfast shows ?
Of course .
Will Saddam 's capture be announced by Bush and Blair simultaneously ?.
But this is all part of the problem .
True , Churchill and Roosevelt argued about the timing of the announcement that war in Europe had ended .
And it was the Russians who pipped them to the post .
But we told the truth .
When the British were retreating to Dunkirk , Churchill announced that the Germans had " penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their tracks " .
Why did n't Bush or Blair tell us this when the Iraqi insurgents began to assault the Western occupation forces ?
Well , they were too busy telling us that things were getting better , that the rebels were mere " dead- enders " .
On 17 June 1940 , Churchill told the people of Britain : " The news from France is very bad and I grieve for the gallant French people who have fallen into this terrible misfortune . "
Why did n't Blair or Bush tell us that the news from Iraq was very bad and that they grieved – even just a few tears for a minute or so – for the Iraqis ?
For these were the men who had the temerity , the sheer , unadulterated gall , to dress themselves up as Churchill , heroes who would stage a rerun of the Second World War , the BBC dutifully calling the invaders " the Allies " – they did , by the way – and painting Saddam 's regime as the Third Reich .
Of course , when I was at school , our leaders – Attlee , Churchill , Eden , Macmillan , or Truman , Eisenhower and Kennedy in the United States – had real experience of real war .
Not a single Western leader today has any first - hand experience of conflict .
When the Anglo - American invasion of Iraq began , the most prominent European opponent of the war was Jacques Chirac , who fought in the Algerian conflict .
But he has now gone .
So has Colin Powell , a Vietnam veteran but himself duped by Rumsfeld and the CIA .
Yet one of the terrible ironies of our times is that the most bloodthirsty of American statesmen – Bush and Cheney , Rumsfeld and Wolfovitz – have either never heard a shot fired in anger or have ensured they did not have to fight for their country when they had the chance to do so .
No wonder Hollywood titles like " Shock and Awe " appeal to the White House .
Movies are their only experience of human conflict ; the same goes for Blair and Brown .
Churchill had to account for the loss of Singapore before a packed House .
Brown wo n't even account for Iraq until the war is over .
It is a grotesque truism that today – after all the posturing of our political midgets five years ago – we might at last be permitted a valid seance with the ghosts of the Second World War .
Statistics are the medium , and the room would have to be dark .
But it is a fact that the total of US dead in Iraq ( 3,978 ) is well over the number of American casualties suffered in the initial D - Day landings at Normandy ( 3,384 killed and missing ) on 6 June , 1944 , or more than three times the total British casualties at Arnhem the same year ( 1,200 ) .
They count for just over a third of the total fatalities ( 11,014 ) of the entire British Expeditionary Force from the German invasion of Belgium to the final evacuation at Dunkirk in June 1940 .
The number of British dead in Iraq – 176 – is almost equal to the total of UK forces lost at the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 - 45 ( just over 200 ) .
The number of US wounded in Iraq – 29,395 – is more than nine times the number of Americans injured on 6 June ( 3,184 ) and more than a quarter of the tally for US wounded in the entire 1950 - 53 Korean war ( 103,284 ) .
Iraqi casualties allow an even closer comparison to the Second World War .
Even if we accept the lowest of fatality statistics for civilian dead – they range from 350,000 up to a million – these long ago dwarfed the number of British civilian dead in the flying - bomb blitz on London in 1944 - 45 ( 6,000 ) and now far outnumber the total figure for civilians killed in bombing raids across the United Kingdom – 60,595 dead , 86,182 seriously wounded – from 1940 to 1945 .
Indeed , the Iraqi civilian death toll since our invasion is now greater than the total number of British military fatalities in the Second World War , which came to an astounding 265,000 dead ( some histories give this figure as 300,000 ) and 277,000 wounded .
Minimum estimates for Iraqi dead mean that the civilians of Mesopotamia have suffered six or seven Dresdens or – more terrible still – two Hiroshimas .
Yet in a sense , all this is a distraction from the awful truth in Buchanan 's warning .
We have dispatched our armies into the land of Islam .
We have done so with the sole encouragement of Israel , whose own false intelligence over Iraq has been discreetly forgotten by our masters , while weeping crocodile tears for the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have died .
America 's massive military prestige has been irreparably diminished .
And if there are , as I now calculate , 22 times as many Western troops in the Muslim world as there were at the time of the 11th and 12th century Crusades , we must ask what we are doing .
Are we there for oil ?
For democracy ?
For Israel ?
For fear of weapons of mass destruction ?
Or for fear of Islam ?
We blithely connect Afghanistan to Iraq .
If only Washington had not become distracted by Iraq , so the narrative now goes , the Taliban could not have re-established themselves .
But al - Qa'ida and the nebulous Osama bin Laden were not distracted .
Which is why they expanded their operations into Iraq and then used this experience to assault the West in Afghanistan with the hitherto – in Afghanistan – unheard of suicide bomber .
And I will hazard a terrible guess : that we have lost Afghanistan as surely as we have lost Iraq and as surely as we are going to " lose " Pakistan .
It is our presence , our power , our arrogance , our refusal to learn from history and our terror – yes , our terror – of Islam that is leading us into the abyss .
And until we learn to leave these Muslim peoples alone , our catastrophe in the Middle East will only become graver .
There is no connection between Islam and " terror " .
But there is a connection between our occupation of Muslim lands and " terror " .
It 's not too complicated an equation .
And we do n't need a public inquiry to get it right .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It looks like the Federal Reserve has opened up a can of worms .
The Fed , by agreeing to take part in JPMorgan Chase 's bailout / buyout of Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) , sent the signal that it might be willing to step in and help other firms take over struggling banks .
The central bank said it will back $ 29 billion of potential losses by Bear Stearns .
JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) is only on the hook for a $ 1 billion hit .
The Fed did not make a similar guarantee when Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) agreed to buy beleaguered mortgage lender Countrywide Financial ( CFC , Fortune 500 ) in January .
But some worry that the Fed may have to step in to save the deal if the mortgage implosion worsens .
Now other banks appear to be angling for a spot at the Fed trough .
In an interview with the San Francisco Business Times last week , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) Chief Executive John Stumpf said his bank " would not be averse to a Fed- assisted transaction " and added that " fixer - uppers do n't bother us . "
Well , who would n't be interested in a fixer - upper if you know that the Fed will be there to help you deal with all those losses ?
Heck , I 'd buy the house from that Tom Hanks movie " The Money Pit " if a friendly central banker was willing to reimburse me for all the renovation costs .
The story suggested that Wells Fargo could be a natural acquirer for National City ( NCC , Fortune 500 ) , the Cleveland - based regional bank that has been hit hard by the subprime mortgage meltdown and is , according to several reports , looking for a buyer .
If the Fed helps Wells Fargo buy National City or another bank that has been whacked by the credit crunch , when does it stop ?
How many banks should the Fed save ?
And how much taxpayer money will be put on the line to guarantee potential losses that the buyers would incur ?
Hopefully , the Bear Stearns rescue was an isolated incident , a deal that the Fed felt it had to take part in because of the risks of having one of the nation 's top investment banks , one that is a particularly big player in the all important bond and mortgage - security markets , go under .
Richard Bove , a bank analyst with Punk , Ziegel & Co. , said he thinks the Fed had to save Bear Stearns but he did not approve of the way the Fed did it .
He said that during the last major banking crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s , it was routine for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , the regulatory agency that insures bank deposits , to step in and save failing banks .
But Bove pointed out that what the FDIC usually did was fire the banks ' top management teams , eliminate their boards of directors and even place the banks in bankruptcy before negotiating sales to more stable banks .
That obviously did n't happen here .
" The Fed did the right thing but they did not do it in the right way .
Sometimes things become too big to fail and this was a pure bailout .
They let management off the hook , " Bove said .
It would be disturbing if the Fed 's involvement in the Bear Stearns deal was the start of a trend .
Firms should be allowed to fail - even if it causes pain in the process .
Weeding out the financial services companies that took undue risks during the housing bubble is one way to possibly strengthen the financial sector going forward and send the strong message to Wall Street that rampant speculation has its consequences .
Agreeing to cover huge losses so that mammoth financial institutions can get even bigger without having to worry about the risks of a deal going awry strikes me as irresponsible .
Whatever happened to the concept of " buyer beware ? "
It does n't seem to apply if you 're a big bank looking to buy a near - bankrupt rival on the cheap .
Money under the mattress ?
Say it ai n't so
I was originally going to write a little rant about the results of the latest Quick Poll we have on our site .
According to this admittedly unscientific survey , nearly a third of you said that you think " under your mattress " is the most comfortable place to put your money now .
That 's disheartening .
Yes , the economy has hit a rough patch , to say the least .
And the stock and bond markets are in flux .
But panicking and putting your money in an asset where the only guaranteed return you 're likely to see is a huge increase in dust bunnies is not a sound idea .
For the long haul , you do n't want to overreact and pull money out of stocks .
I 'd go on at more length about why you should stay in the market but my colleague Walter Updegrave at Money magazine has a great blog post on our site today about this very topic .
Check it out .
It 's a reasoned , rational take on what to do in these troubled times .

Obama disagrees with high court on child rape case Associated Press
Published : Thursday June 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Democrat Barack Obama said Wednesday he disagrees with the Supreme Court 's decision outlawing executions of people who rape children , a crime he said states have the right to consider for capital punishment .
" I have said repeatedly that I think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " Obama said at a news conference .
" I think that the rape of a small child , 6 or 8 years old , is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow , limited , well - defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable , that that does not violate our Constitution . "
The court 's 5 - 4 decision Wednesday struck down a Louisiana law that allows capital punishment for people convicted of raping children under 12 , saying it violates the Constitution 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
The ruling spares the only people in the U.S. under sentence of death for that crime  two Louisiana men convicted of raping girls 5 and 8 .
It also invalidates laws on the books in five other states that allowed executions for child rape that does not result in the death of the victim .
Obama 's Republican rival , John McCain , also criticized the court 's decision , calling it " an assault on law enforcement 's efforts to punish these heinous felons for the most despicable crime . "
" That there is a judge anywhere in America who does not believe that the rape of a child represents the most heinous of crimes , which is deserving of the most serious of punishments , is profoundly disturbing , " McCain said in a statement .
Obama , the likely Democratic presidential nominee , said that had the court " said we want to constrain the abilities of states to do this to make sure that it 's done in a careful and appropriate way , that would have been one thing .
But it basically had a blanket prohibition and I disagree with that decision . "
Obama has two daughters , ages 7 and 9 .
He has long supported the death penalty while criticizing the way it is sometimes applied .
As an Illinois legislator , he helped rewrite the state 's death penalty system to guard against innocent people being sentenced to die .
The new safeguards included requiring police to videotape interrogations and giving the state Supreme Court more power to overturn unjust decisions .
He also opposed legislation making it easier to impose the death penalty for murders committed as part of gang activity .
Obama argued the language was too vague and could be abused by authorities .
But Obama has never rejected the death penalty entirely .
He supported death sentences for killing volunteers in community policing programs and for particularly cruel murders of elderly people .
" While the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime , I believe there are some crimes  mass murder , the rape and murder of a child  so heinous , so beyond the pale , that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment , " he wrote in his book " The Audacity of Hope . "
In 1988 , a question about rape and capital punishment tripped up Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis .
Dukakis was asked during a nationally televised debate with Republican George H. W. Bush whether he'd still oppose the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered .
His unemotional , dispassionate answer was ridiculed , and gave Republicans more material to paint him as an emotionless liberal .
At the news conference Wednesday , Obama answered questions on a number of topics , including a compromise eavesdropping bill the Senate was preparing to consider .
He said he supports the bill , which would establish new rules to govern when the National Security Agency , CIA , FBI or others can tap American phone and computer lines .
The bill also effectively gives legal immunity to telecommunications companies that helped the government eavesdrop on calls and e-mails for years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , without the approval of a special , secret court .
Obama , who opposed an earlier version of the bill , said he supports the compromise partly because it would prohibit presidents from superseding surveillance rules in the future .
New net neutrality bill introduced
By Peter Kaplan
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday introduced legislation that would bar network providers from discriminating against some Internet content .
Committee chairman John Conyers , a Democrat from Michigan , said the bill he and California Democratic Rep .
Zoe Lofgren had introduced would require U.S. broadband providers to operate their networks " in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner so that all content , applications and services are treated the same and have an equal opportunity to reach consumers . "
" If we allow companies with monopoly or duopoly power to control how the Internet operates , network providers could have the power to choose what content is available , " Conyers said in a statement .
Verizon spokesman David Fish responded in a statement , saying such a bill would be " tough sell " in Congress .
" Broadband deployment is a bright spot in the U.S. economy that provides high paying jobs , unprecedented infrastructure investment , and innovation .
Why would Congress want to jeopardize all that with this bill ? "
Fish said .
At issue is the so - called " network neutrality " controversy that pits open - Internet advocates against some service providers , who say they need to take reasonable steps to manage ever - growing traffic on their networks .
Some of network neutrality complaints have centered on charges that broadband companies were engaged in anti-competitive conduct , while others involved charges of political censorship .
The net neutrality issue has been spotlighted by a series of incidents in which network operators , such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Wireless were accused of hindering certain online data moving over their networks , such as file - sharing or text - messaging .
Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc .
In February the chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee introduced separate legislation that would require regulators at the Federal Communications Commission to study the network neutrality issue and hold public hearings .
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin has said that his agency was ready , if necessary , to step in and stop broadband providers from interfering with users ' access .

Judge 's Preliminary Ruling May Force CIA To Hand Over Additional Documents
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2689 or 2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union today obtained several heavily redacted documents concerning the CIA 's use of waterboarding as well as a CIA Office of Inspector General report on the CIA 's interrogation and detention program .
The CIA turned over the documents in response to an ongoing Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit brought by the ACLU and other organizations seeking documents related to the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody overseas .
Government lawyers informed the ACLU today that a federal judge has also " preliminarily overruled " claims by the CIA that other documents it continues to withhold are exempt from the FOIA .
" Even a cursory glance at these heavily - redacted documents shows that the CIA is still withholding a great deal of information that should be released , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" This information is being withheld not for legitimate security reasons but rather to shield government officials who ought to be held accountable for their decisions to break the law . "
One of the documents obtained by the ACLU today is a heavily redacted version of a report by the CIA Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) on its review of the CIA 's interrogation and detention program .
The report includes information about an as yet undisclosed Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) opinion from August 2002 .
This opinion appears to be the same OLC memo authorizing specific interrogations methods for use by the CIA that is being withheld by the CIA as a classified document in the ACLU 's FOIA litigation .
However , the OIG report refers to this document as " unclassified . "
In addition to the documents obtained by the ACLU today , Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York has preliminarily overruled the CIA 's claims that other documents relating to the treatment of detainees are exempt from disclosure under the ACLU 's FOIA lawsuit .
In January 2008 , Judge Hellerstein ordered the CIA to provide him with a sample of the withheld documents so he could determine for himself whether they should be made public .
The documents that could be made public in response to Judge Hellerstein 's ruling include :
A September 17 , 2001 CIA Presidential Directive setting up secret CIA detention centers abroad ;
An August 2002 OLC memo authorizing the CIA to use particular interrogation methods ; and
CIA documents gathered by the CIA 's Inspector General in the course of investigations into unlawful and improper conduct by CIA personnel .
" We welcome the court 's preliminary ruling rejecting the CIA 's attempt to withhold records relating to its unlawful treatment of prisoners , " said Amrit Singh , staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project .
" If sustained , this ruling would be a historic victory that could compel the CIA to publicly disclose for the first time meaningful records relating to its use of torture . "
Judge Hellerstein is still considering the ACLU 's motion to hold the CIA in contempt of court for destroying hundreds of hours of videotape depicting the abusive interrogations of two detainees in its custody .
In addition to Jaffer and Singh , attorneys on the case are Alexa Kolbi-Molinas and Judy Rabinovitz of the national ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the New York Civil Liberties Union ; Lawrence S. Lustberg and Melanca D. Clark of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons P.C. ; and Shayana Kadidal and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights .

Of all the ware Microsoft churns out from its sweatshop of " lightning bolt , lightning bolt " nerds , Windows is the one most inexorably tied to the public image of the company .
As Bill Gates leaves the building , we look back on the last baby birthed - if not fully gestated - under his watch , the swan song operating system that he himself has issues with .
Although we agree that Vista could have used a bit more time shoved back into the silicon womb for some feature buffing and bug fixing , it 's not nearly as bad as most people are making it out to be .
That 's right , I 'm actually happy with Windows Vista , which I use about one - third of the time I spend at a computer .

This may be counterintuitive , seeing as our guy who defended Windows does n't even like Vista , but I 've used Mac OS X and Vista side by side and simultaneously for over a year ( and before that , Mac and XP ) thanks to the dual - computer - controlling app Synergy .
Here 's why Vista 's not that bad :
Advertisement
1 . It 's more secure than Windows XP .
After being implicitly responsible for botnets and security breaches through the incredible popularity of their Windows XP , Microsoft went back and made sure Vista is more secure than its predecessor .
And it is .
According to security firm PC Tools , Vista had 639 unique threats over a six - month period , whereas XP had 1021 .
This came from much internal restructuring under the hood , but there 's a chance that it might be due to Vista being a smaller target than XP for malware as well .
2 . It 's the best looking Windows yet .
Despite any complaints users may have about Aero hogging up too many CPU cycles or requiring a video card from this millennium to use , it 's still the best looking Windows yet .
I mean really , do you remember what XP looked like out of the box ?
With that gigantic balloon of a task bar and the green Start button .
Vista 's glass definitely trumps that .
And then there 's the underlying graphical framework changes which allow new features like live thumbnails .
All these visual effects may require more power , but you can't deny that it 's pleasing to look at .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
If you want to disable Aero for certain applications for performance or compatibility reasons , see here .

3. Games work just about as well as under XP .
There 's a slight performance degradation under Vista when compared to Windows XP using the exact same hardware .
Is it noticeable ?
Probably , but it 's somewhere around the level of 10 % .
There 's also the consideration of DirectX 10 and the visual improvements you 'll get in the future when more developers really take advantage of it .
With a slightly better video card , you wo n't even really notice that you 're going at 90 FPS versus 100FPS .
4. Vista Media Center is a fantastic DVR .
Microsoft integrates their fantastic Windows Media Center Edition into Home Premium and Ultimate , and it's pretty much the best DVR you can get outside of getting a TiVo .
Combine it with various Media Center Extenders , of which there are lots ( such as the Xbox 360 ) , you can get HDTV streamed to anywhere in your house from one computer in your office .
Our only complaint is still that Cable Labs does n't allow you to stick a CableCARD tuner onto just any appropriately spec'd Vista PC — you actually have to buy a machine pre-made for CableCARD .
Advertisement
5 . The sleep mode works .
Sleep mode in Windows XP was essentially a shortcut for locking up your computer and forcing you to reboot .
It actually does what it 's supposed to in Vista .
6. Built - in search is better and more useful .
Vista 's searching feature relies on cataloging your hard drive , then searching the resulting database to quickly ( and easily ) find your files .
By default it 's just limited to a couple user folders , but if you expand it to your entire hard drive , you 'll be able to find anything fast , much like the way Spotlight works on a Mac .
The downside is that during the first day or two , everything slows down while Vista indexes your computer .
Best to leave it on overnight or over a weekend while you 're away .
Advertisement
7. User Account Control is useful for some people .
I have to admit that I 've turned this off but UAC — the thing that pops up and asks you for your password whenever you do something on the system level — is useful in theory for many people , especially those who share a family computer .
Hide the administrator password from your parents / grandparents / kids so they wo n't be able to install any weird apps they 're not supposed to .
In practice , it 's a bit annoying in that it pops up for mundane things that should n't really need system - level clearance .
It 's a step in the right direction ; however , if you want to disable UAC for certain programs , see here .
Advertisement
8. Drivers support is n't as bad as it's made out to be .
Although " Man gets Windows Vista to work with printer " may be an actual non-Onion headline , the root cause of his original woes was that the man installed a Windows XP printer driver instead of the correct Vista one .
But there is a smaller percentage of users who - no matter how old or new their peripheral is - ca n't get it to work with Windows Vista .
The blame for this lies on peripheral manufacturers who either can't or wo n't update their drivers to support the new OS .
There 's not much you or Microsoft can do here , but it 's rarer than you 'd think from reading the internet .
9 . It 's not any buggier than Windows XP .
This is a bit of a corollary to # 1 , but out of the many , many Vista users we 've seen , they almost all agree that the only times Vista has crashed or blue - screened on them was when they were doing something they usually do n't do .
The OS by itself rarely crashes in everyday use , and compared to even OS X Leopard , it 's pretty damn sturdy .
In a year 's worth of daily use , we think the OS has probably only crashed once , if that .
Advertisement
10 . Vista is not slow if you have enough RAM .
One of the main complaints that users have is that Vista is slow , but they either upgraded Vista from an old machine or they purchased a " Vista Ready " system with only 512MB to 1GB worth of RAM .
You can run Vista with 1GB of RAM , but like OS X , you really want to have at least 2GB .
Modern operating systems get fatter because they DO more stuff for you under the hood , such as optimizing your memory for the applications you run often so they load faster .
We 're not saying that Vista does n't have its faults or that Windows 7 wo n't be better , we 're saying that Vista is just not as bad as people are making it out to be .
If you 're on XP and you 're afraid to upgrade , do n't be .
It 's no worse than Windows XP if you pay attention to the stuff I mentioned above .
As long as you 've got a reasonably decent machine - and if you 're reading Giz it 's likely that you do - you 're pretty safe in upgrading .
Advertisement
That said , we do have some major complaints :
1 . Things are n't where they used to be .
Holy shit .
This one is the worst .
Various settings are hidden under levels of menus , and for some inexplicable reason , Add / Remove Programs is no longer Add / Remove programs .
What 's the point of this ?
So people can use the hundreds of wizards more ?

2 . File transfers are slower than on XP , which is slightly fixed with Service Pack 1 , but still has problems .
Here 's the reason why .
And if you 've got problems with slow browsing , see here .
Advertisement
3 . Wireless networking is a pain .
Windows has never been great at presenting wireless networking with an intuitive UI , and Vista might be even worse than XP in this department .
Stuff 's buried behind various weirdly - named menus , which you have to ( at least the first few times ) guess at to see .
4 . Lots of balloon notifications pop up on the taskbar .
Here 's how to shut them off .

5 . Folder view in Windows Explorer does n't remember your settings .
Here 's another huge pain users have run into when browsing a folder and all of a sudden having Explorer think that these are photos because there 's just one photo in the directory .
Here 's how to turn that off .

Bonus Vista Tip :
How to recover files from Vista 's built - in shadow copy here .
It ’s belatedly dawned on me how OpenSocial makes a great server - less Ajax platform .
When you create an OpenSocial gadget , you ’re building a lil Ajax app that performs much coolness that would normally require a server , but does n’t .
Effectively , you ’re delegating the duties of the gadget ’s host environment .
All you have to do is write a single XML file and host it somewhere .
In fact Google Gadget Editor gives you an editor to write it in and a place to host it .
In fact , this is so good that if I was teaching someone Ajax in 60 minutes or less , I would consider getting them to write a gadget .
It ’s that simple .
Previously , I might have got them to write a static HTML file , with embedded Javascript and CSS , but now they can do the same thing and benefit from server - side features too , features they never had to install .
This is like getting the usual benefits of the DOM and the Javascript API , but with much more .
You ’re getting both a set of APIs , just like when you use JQuery or Prototype , but you ’re also getting a server which many of those APIs rely on .
So it ’s a true platform .
By the way , I ’m assuming you ’re using XML content type , not URL .
XML content type is the way forward , especially as we move to a Caja world .
XML gadgets will get you the richest functionality .
URL gadgets are only suitable for legacy concerns , and in some cases , accessibility .
So you ’re using XML content type , which means the entirety of your Ajax app lives in one file .
What does an OpenSocial platform provide to your little XML gadget spec ?
Persistence .
The most important thing is you can save application data .
You can serialise any state you care to persist , and then store it as a hidden user preference .
This is really neat .
It means you can write a TODO gadget , for example , and ensure all the TODO tasks will be saved , but without having to store them on your own database and without having to build a persistence layer around it .
And of course , the platform will ( theoretically ) provide the necessary security to ensure users only see their own tasks .

Preferences .
You can easily let users customise your app via the preference API .
For free , you get form fields to let users state their preferences , with drop - downs for enumerated types .
And of course , the preferences are persisted without any effort on your part .

Content Fetching .
It gets even better .
On - Demand Javascript is often bigged up as the way to get data from third parties .
But thanks to OpenSocial 's remote fetching APIs , it 's just as easy to grab content via the containers Cross - Domain Proxy .
This means you can get any internet content and call any API , not just those specifically designed for cross - domain browser calls .
There are also value - adds here , e.g. caching , scheduling periodic updates , converting feed data of any format into a consistent JSON structure .

Identity and Social Networking .
Ah yes , the almighty " social " in OpenSocial .
On the right platform , your server - less Ajax app can get info about the page owner and the page viewer , and their friends .
Friends and social stuff and knowing whose page it is , that 's cool and all .
But what 's really exciting here is much simpler than that - it 's simply IDENTITY .
What matters most is :
With a single API call , you get an ID for the guy viewing your gadget !!!
You did n't have to handle registration , password reminder links , etc. etc. , and go through all the associated security questions around it .
All the usual stuff you have to do if you want to know who 's using your application .
It 's all * free * to you , gadget developer .
( Downside is your company does n't " own the user " , so your gadget will never get you pina coladas on the beach at noon and an environmentally - conscious hybrid vehicle to sip frappachino grandès in . )
With this user handle , you can also save a hashmap of information about the user , persisted by our friend the server .

You did n't have to handle registration , password reminder links , etc. etc. , and go through all the associated security questions around it .
All the usual stuff you have to do if you want to know who 's using your application .
It 's all * free * to you , gadget developer .
( Downside is your company does n't " own the user " , so your gadget will never get you pina coladas on the beach at noon and an environmentally - conscious hybrid vehicle to sip frappachino grandès in . )
With this user handle , you can also save a hashmap of information about the user , persisted by our friend the server .
Many other services .
Each platform is free to provide any number of features beyond the required API ; this is how platforms compete against each other in the OpenSocial world .
" Feature " is actually the term used for a particular set of browser and server services , e.g. " dynamic height " - the ability for a gadget to update its height - is a standard OpenSocial feature .
Notifications - the ability for gadgets to add little notes to the top which the user must manually clear - well , that 's a custom feature iGoogle provides but others do n't .
So anyway , there are lots of these features and your gadgets get them for free .
In most cases , they are just libraries which you could also get for free by using Scriptaculous or whatever ... but still , with OpenSocial , it 's really , really , easy !
No download or installation .
( Although it must be said that with library CDNs like Google 's new effort , you can also use many Ajax libraries without installation too .
The difference here is that at least some of these features are tied to server - side services as well . )
So , these days , OpenSocial may well be the easiest way for a newbie to learn Ajax , and for any developer to get an Ajax app up and running .
I actually think we need more tools and services to allow standard Ajax apps - not gadgets - to get up and running fast too .
After all , the UI in OpenSocial is based on a widget / gadget model , and this is a mini web app running on a bigger page .
Nowadays , we have canvas gadgets , which are bigger , but still not so big and run inside another web page .
What if you took the same cloudish platform principles and applied it to a big old Ajax app , occupying the entire page and with its own URL ( though probably coming from the platform ’s domain ) .
You can sort of do that already by looking at the content of the gadget iframe , but it ’s not designed for that purpose … and if it was , you could do some interesting stuff .
For instance , I envisage a simple - to - use cloud storage system based around principles of Persevere and CouchDB , and for limited use , it could even allow anonymous access .
I ’ll perhaps demo all this at some stage .
Seven Ways That Choice Makes Your Life Hell
Do you think that having more choices is good for you ?
Choice is critical to the feeling and practice of freedom .
Without choice , you would be doing exactly what you ’re told to do , every moment of the day .
You ’d be following your programming like a machine with no soul .
A kind of pretend choice is where you can choose between the options that are given you , but the options seem empty of value , or virtually identical .
Typically , in that case , you have no power to change the options that are available .
That ’s not much of a choice either !
Real choice , on the other hand , goes way beyond the choices that the world drops in front you .
You think about what ’s possible for you , and you choose to go after those possibilities .
These kind of choices can lead you to extraordinary places within yourself .
These choices are critical to finding the greatness within you .
These choices are critical to making a better world .
There are many wonderful things that we can say about choice , and I ’ve written about the positive side of it many times .
Choices that make your world dark and bitter
But it ’s not all joy and wonder and fun and games .
In fact , sometimes choice brings us hell on earth .
Barry Schwartz has written a really insightful book on the dark side of choice , called The Paradox of Choice .
Even though some choice is good , we ’ll explain why too much choice can be an incredible burden .
I ’ve extracted and combined the many ideas that Schwartz discusses into 7 key issues .
Each of these issues , if you ’re unaware of it , and unprepared for it , is like a pit or gateway that opens into a more burdened , dysfunctional life – a personal hell .
These gates are not about one - time problems .
They relate to ongoing , chronic issues .
The First Gate : More products , more choices , more effort
There have never been more choices , in breakfast cereals , cookies , cars – nearly every consumer product you can think of .
But this choice has a cost .
Studies show that people want more control over the details of their lives , at the same time they also want to simplify their lives .
In other words , they want more choices , but they do n’t want to deal with the complexity that comes with all those choices .
If you had to make a choice every second about what to do , you would go crazy .
Habits and rules and customs make certain behavior automatic so you do n’t have to choose in those situations .
This can make life simpler , but at the cost of missing some opportunities .
In studies , people will tell you that they ’re happy to have more choices , but in practice they do n’t begin to make use of all the opportunities they have to make choices .
The explosion of options and opportunities that is everywhere in affluent countries has 3 related , unfortunate events
Decisions require more effort
Mistakes are more likely
Psychological consequences of mistakes more severe .
There are so many options , wherever you turn , that researching and deciding can eat up your time , and your time is your life .
You feel this .
No one has enough time , and it ’s getting worse .
You feel that all of these choices , so many of them about trivial things , are an unfair burden that is stealing your life from you .
The Second Gate : Expert Choices
Even worse is the increasing freedom that your doctor gives you to choose your treatment .
Doctors never used to ask a patient ’s opinion about anything medical , so it ’s great that we ’re starting to be informed and have choices .
But again , studies show that patients often do n’t want the freedom that has been given them .
65 % of people say they would want to choose their treatment if they got cancer , but only 12 % actually want to choose their treatment , after they get cancer .
In a life and death situation that requires expertise that you do n’t have , it ’s frightening and dangerous to make decisions .
It increases your stress level , and makes you unhappy .
Even if you can find good information to help you decide among options , do you really know how to analyze , sift , weigh , and evaluate it to make the right choices ?
I love looking for information on the web , but when there are a thousand opinions about everything , how do you use that information ?
The Third Gate : You are Your Choices
More and more , you and I use our choices to tell the world who we are and what we care about .
Often you will make choices to express who you are , even when you know that those choices have no real consequences .
For example , there ’s a true story about two friends who drove together to the American embassy in a foreign country to vote , even though each knew that they would vote for competing candidates and cancel out each other ’s vote .
You use your choices to define who you are , sometimes so others know , and sometimes , just so you know .
This is all great .
But , living with more and more choices , you start using more and more of them to express who you are .
The most trivial choices become important when you think that others will judge you based on those choices .
And when you feel that every choice is being watched , your discomfort and stress level goes up , and up .
The Fourth Gate : Negative Media Rules the World
You ’re being attacked with more and more information every day .
It ’s natural to expect yourself to pay attention to what ’s important and take action on it .
You tell yourself that all the time .
But in the face of a growing mountain of information , you ca n’t satisfy that sense of responsibility .
And studies show that we give more weight to information based on how vivid , and how negative it is .
It ’s the unfortunate truth that negative information draws your attention more than positive .
I guess it ’s part of your survival programming to react to the negative more strongly .
And the media abuses that knowledge to focus on the negative to hold your attention , and maybe sell you something .
And then you expect yourself to do something with all that information ?
You ca n’t just ignore it , can you ?
And another problem .
Studies show that you take the frequency of certain events being reported as evidence of the pervasiveness of those events .
The media uses the negative because it grabs our attention , and your natural response is to think that the negative dominates the whole world .
This distortion causes you to dramatically miscalculate the various risks you face in life , and leads to some very bad choices .
( In Part II , we ’ll discuss the remaining three gates that can lead you to a hellish life , when you ’re unaware of them . )
101 - year - old Oakland newsstand to close tonight oakland The 101 - year - old downtown landmark victim of Internet age
Business goes on as usual at DeLauer 's Super Newsstand in Oakland , Calif. , on Tuesday , June 24 , 2008 .
Opened in 1907 , DeLauer 's , a downtown Oakland landmark that once was packed with newspapers , magazines and books from across America and beyond , is closing this week , a victim of the slow economy and Internet news sites .

In another sign that the printed word may be going the way of polar ice caps , the renowned 101 - year - old De Lauer 's newsstand on Broadway in Oakland is going out of business .
" We have to close , " said Charles De Lauer , the 91 - year - old proprietor whose father started the enterprise selling papers from small wagons in 1907 .
" Things just got too hard . "
The 24 - hour - a - day store that once sold newspapers and magazines from around the world will shut down at 10 p.m. tonight , store manager Fasil Lemme said today .
" This is a business that time is passing by because everybody has a computer , " said De Lauer 's accountant Joe Churchward .
" Your news is at the click of a button . "
De Lauer 's is located between 13th and 14th streets , in the heart of downtown near City Hall and just a few doors around the corner from the landmark Tribune Tower , abandoned by its namesake newspaper last year .
News of De Lauer 's closing comes less than a week after the legendary Cody 's Books in Berkeley shuttered the doors on its last incarnation on Shattuck Avenue .
" It 's a sad day for Mr. De Lauer , " Churchward said .
" It 's been 101 years . "
Cumulative losses over the past several years combined with the serious illness of De Lauer to force the closure , Churchward said .
De Lauer continued to go to work and actively run the business until about eight or nine months ago when he became weakened by leukemia , he said .
He added that his wife and two sons tried to pitch in but could n't overcome the economics .
Income at the business , which also sells books , snacks and various sundries , was relatively stable in recent years , but it could n't offset the rising costs of labor , rent and publications , Churchward said .
Annual losses ranged from $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 for the past three to five years , he said .
Said De Lauer , " The amazing part of it is , we 've managed to stay in there as long as we have . "
Theft , too , has taken a toll on the business , accounting for losses of $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 a year , Churchward said .
The announced closure generated a flurry of discussions about possible ways to save the business .
David Glover , executive director of Occur , an Oakland nonprofit group devoted to strengthening local communities , said he 's encountered many people who would like to save De Lauer's .
" It is my hope that the city of Oakland and private interests and community interests can come together to prevent a closure , " he said on a visit to the newsstand Tuesday .
" It 's a 101 - year - old institution , " Glover said .
" It has a special place in the landscape of this community . "
After city officials learned Tuesday of the impending closure , they asked the Oakland Commerce Corp. , a nonprofit group contracted by the city to assist in business retention , to investigate ways that De Lauer 's might receive a lifeline , said Aliza Gallo , business development services manager for the city .
A sign at the front of the store boasts 6,000 titles , but De Lauer 's famed selection of international publications has shrunk over the years and was discontinued , except for a couple of foreign papers , about five months ago , Lemme said .
Some shelves stood empty Tuesday .
The business stopped receiving new supplies and is sending back unsold publications .
But a wide selection of books and magazines was still available Tuesday afternoon , with most major magazines and a bewildering array of specialty periodicals devoted to sports , cars , motorcycles and other interests , including purchasing military hardware ( Military Trader ) and keeping cats well ( Feline Wellness ) .
A back corner of the store boasted four varieties of farmers ' almanacs .
One could also still purchase a Spanish version of a Haynes auto manual for Ford and Mercury vehicles made before Ronald Reagan was president .
And would - be diplomats could buy " Master the American Foreign Service Officer Exam . "
Some of the poorer clientele who can't afford to buy the publications have used De Lauer 's as a place to spend hours catching up on their reading , Lemme said .
" This is not only a business place , " he said .
" It is also like a library . "
Dug sez , " I gather that you can do two things with the machine .
First , the machine will produce various sine waves for you on paper after you set values for the amplitude and phase angle .
Second , in a reversal of this process , you can trace a curve and use Fourier analysis to extract the phase and amplitude of the curve .
All of this is done mechanically .
There are tons of great pictures of the device on this site . "
This is n't a vintage piece , either — it was built recently , and the makers provided extensive material documenting the process .

( Thanks , Dug ! )
SIX days ahead of the North Carolina primary comes a story of real sleaze — not Jeremiah Wright - style buffoonery , but Nixon - style illegality designed to dupe and disenfranchise voters — that should surprise precisely nobody who has been following and covering this campaign .
A group called Women 's Voices Women 's Vote ( WVWV ) , which claims to have been " created to activate unmarried Americans in their government and in our democracy " has been placing robocalls to voters across North Carolina that seem designed to fool them into thinking they have not yet registered to vote .
Many of the voters who received those calls are black .
Voters in 11 states have complained about similarly deceptive calls and mailings that have been traced back to WVWV this primary season .
Guess which Democratic candidate WVWV 's founder and president , Page Gardner , has donated $ 6,700 to ( hint : it 's not Barack Obama ) .
Guess whose election campaign Joe Goode , WVWV 's executive director , worked for ( hint : it was in 1992 , and it was a winning campaign ) .
Guess whose chief of staff sits on WVWV 's board of directors ( hint : it was the president who served between two Bushes ) .
And guess whose campaign manager was a member of WVWV 's leadership team ( hint : it 's Hillary Clinton ) .
It 's an odd story : a recording of someone named Lamont Williams calls voters to tell them a voter - registration packet is on its way .
It 's unclear whether anything arrives ; what is n't unclear is that the call is well after the registration deadline .
It 's not too hard to imagine this call coming to an unsophisticated voter ( and let me make this clear : I am in no way saying black voters , who seem to have received the lion 's share of the calls , are all unsophisticated ; I 'm simply positing a scenario ) , and that voter becoming confused .
Perhaps he thinks he's not registered , and calls his state 's board of elections who tells him it's too late so he stays home on election day .
Perhaps the board of elections does n't know what he 's talking about , and he gets frustrated and stays home , assuming he 's unregistered .
If this were a one - time event , I might be less suspicious , but it 's happened in state after state , always after the registration deadline has passed , and always shortly before the primary .
This is an organisation stuffed with Washington insiders ; incompetence like this simply does n't happen over and over again , not in the same way like this .
Something stinks .
Again , perhaps if the Clinton campaign had n't shown itself to be quite so sleazy ( remember those photos of Barack Obama in Somali garb ? ) ; perhaps if the calls were n't going to the constituency least likely to vote for Mrs Clinton ; perhaps if Mrs Clinton 's supporters were n't so heavily represented among WVWV 's board , it would n't set off as many bells as it does .
But something is n't right here , and it 's not a simple error either .
As a scam , it seems just Rube Goldberg - ish enough to provide plausible deniability for anyone involved , but just authoritative enough to work on some voters .
If it does trace back to Mrs Clinton 's campaign , it will provide further evidence that her cronies have abandoned every shred , everything that ever got them into politics in the first place .
The end ( Mrs Clinton 's victory ) will justify the means .
From flower children of the 1960s to deceivers of black voters in North Carolina in 2008 .
A long , strange trip indeed .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures closed with a loss of more than 2 % Tuesday , retreating from a high above $ 137 a barrel after monthly reports implied that recent record prices as well as weak economies may be causing declines in global and domestic demand growth .
" The familiar divide -- higher on supply worries , lower on demand concerns -- is setting the tone again , " said Michael Fitzpatrick , an analyst at MF Global , in a note to clients .
Crude oil for July delivery climbed as high as $ 137.98 a barrel in electronic trading Tuesday on Globex .
It fell back to close at $ 131.31 , down $ 3.04 , or 2.3 % , on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Early Tuesday , the International Energy Agency lowered its forecast for average global oil product demand in 2008 to 86.8 million barrels a day , down 80,000 barrels a day from its estimate last month .
The decline followed the reduction of price subsidies in several countries that are not part of the group of industrialized nations called the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , the IEA said .
Global oil supply rebounded in the May report by 490,000 barrels a day to average 86.6 million barrels a day , boosted by higher OPEC crude supply .
The increase , however , also follows extensive downward revisions to first - quarter non-OPEC production .
OECD oil stocks fell 8.1 million barrels in April to 2.562 billion , " in stark contrast to the typical build , " IEA said .
Total oil cover remains " above average " at 53.4 days , IEA said .
The IEA , " which cut its demand growth the slowest rate since 2002 , also cut expectations for supply growth , as well , " said Fitzpatrick .
OECD stocks fell at a time when they should be building , he said .
" So , while market participants are starting to recognize that economic deterioration has begun , supply may be stretched more than producers contend , " he said .
By Tuesday afternoon , the Energy Information Administration , the reporting arm of the Energy Department , said preliminary data showed that world oil consumption grew by about 630,000 barrels per day during the first quarter of 2008 .
That 's down from the 1 million barrel - per-day of growth expected in a previous outlook report , released in May .
Most of the downward revision occurred in the OECD countries , the EIA said .
In the U.S. , total consumption of petroleum products averaged 20.7 million barrels per day in 2007 .
It 's expected to shrink by 290,000 barrels per day in 2008 based on prospects for a weak economy and record - high oil and product prices extending into next year , according to the report .
See full story .
The federal government 's assumption is that strong demand and limited supply is causing the spikes in oil prices , said Charles Perry , president of Perry Management , an energy - consulting firm .
" These have some impact , but I also believe the low value of the dollar and speculative traders are causing more of an impact , " he said .
" This market is moving entirely too fast to be caused solely by supply and demand .
Supply and demand are changing much slower than the price of oil . "
See related story .
Saudi talk
The secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , Abdalla Salem el - Badri , told Reuters Tuesday at the Reuters Global Energy Summit that the record - high oil price was " unbearable " and " there is no shortage now and in the future . "
" We are not happy with the current level of price for one reason .
It has nothing to do with the fundamentals , " he said at the summit .
Saudi Arabia will host a meeting of oil producers and consumers on June 22 to discuss record high prices , Thomson Reuters reported Tuesday on its Web site , citing el - Badri .
El - Badri also told Dow Jones on Tuesday that OPEC did n't plan to move against speculators that it blames for the record surge in oil prices .
He said the oil cartel has " very reasonable " spare capacity of 3 million barrels a day , according to a Dow Jones report .
Reports of more violence in oil - rich Nigeria helped support oil prices earlier Tuesday .
The BBC reported that Nigerian militants have killed a sailor in the second attack on navy ships patrolling the Niger Delta region .
Four people were injured in the attack on a ship protecting a vessel belonging to Canadian company Addax Petroleum , the BBC reported .
" Saudi Arabia and Iraq both saw an increase in output which should at least temporarily counteract some of the reduction in supply out of Nigeria , " said Jeff Pritchard , an analyst at Altavest Worldwide Trading .
" Like it or not , the focus right now is on the dollar , " with the rally in the dollar " putting heavy pressure on the crude - oil market , " he said .
The dollar index DXY , +0.06 % , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies , was at 73.637 , up from 72.942 in late North American trading Monday .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke commented on the need to hold down inflation expectations .
See Currencies .
" If the dollar continues to build momentum , crude prices are likely to continue downward , " said Pritchard .
On Monday , crude dropped $ 4.19 to close at $ 134.35 a barrel on the Nymex after touching a low of $ 133.95 .
The decline followed oil 's unprecedented surge of nearly $ 11 a barrel to record levels on Friday .
Bigger picture
Taking a look at the bigger picture , " it is becoming more clear each day that under current conditions , we are peaking in oil production worldwide , " said Perry .
" The U.S. is essentially shut down on any further oil development , but the world [ 's ] government - owned oil companies are not doing a good job in managing their production so [ there 's ] not much possible for new production , " he said .
Still , there 's " a lot of potential if it is unleashed , " including the potential for the U.S. to open up ANWR , the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , he said .
In the meantime , prices for petroleum products closed lower along with crude Tuesday .
July reformulated gasoline fell 7.07 cents to close at $ 3.3193 a gallon and July heating oil shed 6.76 cents to end at $ 3.8124 a gallon .
The average retail prices in the U.S. for a gallon of regular gasoline surpassed $ 4 on Sunday for the first time ever .
See full story .
It stood at $ 4.043 on Tuesday , 31.2 % higher than a year ago , according to AAA 's Daily Fuel Gauge Report .
In a weekly report released Monday , the EIA said the average retail price for a gallon of regular gasoline climbed to $ 4.039 for the week ended June 9 .
That 's up over 12 % from the week ended April 28 .
The EIA 's monthly energy outlook report released Tuesday said that the average price for regular gasoline will likely peak at $ 4.15 in August .
The energy market looked ahead to Wednesday 's data on petroleum supplies from the EIA .
Analysts at MF Global expect the data to show that crude supplies fell 600,000 barrels for the week ended June 6 .
Distillates likely rose by 1.1 million , while motor gasoline inventories likely rose by 300,000 barrels , they said .
Analysts polled by Platts expect to see a decline of 1.4 million barrels in crude supplies as well as increases in distillates of 1.7 million and gasoline of 1.1 million .
The survey also showed that the market 's expecting a rise in refinery utilization of 0.6 % to 90.3 % of capacity for last week .
July natural gas futures fell by 16.5 cents to close at $ 12.435 per million British thermal units , after trading as high as $ 12.68 .
Total natural - gas consumption is expected to rise by 2.2 % in 2008 , with year - over - year increases in residential , commercial and electric power sectors largely weather driven , the EIA said in its monthly report Tuesday .
The EIA 's separate update on natural - gas supplies will be released on Thursday .
Rounding out Tuesday 's trading , energy equities closed lower .
The Amex Natural Gas Index $ XNG shed 1.8 % to end at 731.10 .

Prices for gold futures dropped on the heels of a stronger U.S. dollar .

Corn futures rose for a fifth day after a U.S. report showed lower estimates for corn production in the next season .
