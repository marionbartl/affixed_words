I was very impressed that Brian took the time to rehearse before shooting started .
Especially on low budget film , like Home Movies , this was critical .
It 's much cheaper to resolve the ' What the hell is this scene really about ? ' questions when there is n't a crew of 30 or more people standing around waiting , ...
You had to know this was coming .

We say theoretically , of course , because it 's not quite a perfect rip .

Enlarge Cambridge University via AP Gareth Jones in the 1920s was a student at Trinity College , which is displaying his diaries that detailed Ukrainian famine in 1933 , when Soviet secret police emptied the countryside of grain and livestock .
LONDON ( AP ) 
The diaries of a British reporter who risked his reputation to expose the horrors of Stalin 's murderous famine in Ukraine are to go on display on Friday .
Welsh journalist Gareth Jones snuck into Ukraine in March of 1933 , at the height of an artificial famine engineered by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin as part of his campaign to force peasants into collective farms .
Millions starved to death between 1932 and 1933 as the Soviet secret police emptied the countryside of grain and livestock .
Jones ' reporting was one of the first attempts to bring the disaster to the world 's attention .
His handwritten diaries will be displayed at the Wren Library at Trinity College in Cambridge , where he was a student , until mid-December .
" Famine Grips Russia — Millions Dying " read the front page of the New York Evening Post on March 29 , 1933 .
" Famine on a colossal scale , impending death of millions from hunger , murderous terror ... this is the summary of Mr. Jones 's firsthand observations , " the paper said .
As starvation and cannibalism spread across Ukraine , Soviet authorities exported more than a million tons of grain to the West , using the money to build factories and arm its military .
Historians say that between 4 million and 5 million Ukrainians perished in what is sometimes referred to as the Great Famine .
Walking from village to village , Jones recorded desperate Ukrainians scrambling for food , scribbling brief interviews in pencil on lined notebooks .
" They all had the same story : ' There is no bread — we have n't had bread for two months — a lot are dying , " ' Jones wrote in one entry .
" We are the living dead , " he quoted one peasant as saying .
Jones ' eyewitness account had little effect on world opinion at the time .
Stalin 's totalitarian regime tightly controlled the flow of information out of the U.S.S.R. , and many Moscow - based foreign correspondents — some of whom had pro-Soviet sympathies — refused to believe Jones ' reporting .
The New York Times ' Walter Duranty , a Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist , dismissed Jones ' article as a scare story .
" Conditions are bad , but there is no famine , " Duranty wrote a few days after Jones ' story was published .
Other correspondents chimed in with public denials .
With his colleagues against him , Jones was discredited .
Eugene Lyons , an American wire agency reporter who gradually went from communist sympathizer to fierce critic of the Soviet regime , later acknowledged the role that fellow journalists had played in trying to destroy Jones ' career .
" Jones must have been the most surprised human being alive when the facts he so painstakingly garnered from our mouths were snowed under by our denials , " Lyons wrote in his 1937 autobiography , Assignment in Utopia .
Lyons ' admission came too late for Jones , who was killed under murky circumstances while covering Japan 's expansion into China in the run-up to World War II .
British Prime Minister David Lloyd George , whom Jones had once served as an aide , said shortly after his death in 1935 that the intrepid journalist might have been killed because he " knew too much of what was going on . "
" I had always been afraid that he would take one risk too many . "

As world leaders convene the Copenhagen climate talks , discussion has focused on the need for wealthy countries to reduce emissions .
Far less attention has been paid to the inevitable reality that emissions in the poorest parts of the world need to increase .
And there has been scant recognition of the role played by rapid population growth in rising emissions worldwide .
President Obama is taking a bold first step in Copenhagen by putting forward an ambitious emissions target for the United States .
Yet global population growth threatens to undercut — even cancel — all progress .
Global population may grow by 18 % or more from 2005 to 2020 , according to UN projections .
Reducing carbon emissions is actually three separate but related challenges .
First , we must reduce global emissions .
Second , we must slow population growth by supporting programs such as voluntary family planning .
Third , we must recognize that about half the world now suffers from “ carbon starvation ” and needs to increase emissions .
Historically , as population has increased , emissions have also risen .
Most emissions reductions must occur in wealthier countries since that ’s where they are highest .
At the same time , in order to give billions of poor people a reasonable quality of life , emissions in some parts of the world must increase significantly .
Rapid population growth makes this balancing act even more difficult .
Given available technology , the often - tiny carbon footprints of billions of people are both a cause and an effect of impoverishment .
The one billion people who struggle to survive on less than $ 1 / day use very little in the way of fossil fuels .
And the additional 1.6 billion living on less than $ 2 / day hardly use more .
In order to have decent lives , they must increase their emission levels substantially , despite advances in green technology .
Much of sub-Saharan Africa is mired in the most desperate , grinding poverty imaginable .
Governments there are already unable to meet the most basic needs of their citizens .
And it is these people — who contribute least to climate change — who will suffer most from the problems that climate change brings .
Women especially will face new challenges to their health , livelihoods , and even their lives .
Africa ’s per-capita emissions must increase .
But , if Africa ’s population grows by the 39 % that is projected by 2020 , it will be nearly impossible to create a healthy quality of life for people in that part of the world .
Population growth will undermine all efforts to achieve lower carbon emissions unless investments in clean energy are matched by equally comprehensive investments in universal access to contraception along with other health and development programs .
As we develop hybrid cars and the like , what about the other half of the world ?
Will they be left to sweat and starve while we glide forward into a century of renewable energy ?
Their carbon footprint needs to grow .
That can only work if we are willing to meet the population growth challenge .
This is one of those times — and one of those issues — where we need to keep our eye on multiple goals .
Reducing emissions is an energy issue .
But it is also in equal measure a human rights challenge , one that must include unprecedented investments in a full spectrum of reproductive health services for women and couples .
Worldwide , 200 million women have an unmet need for family planning .
And demand for contraception is projected to increase by 40 % in just 15 years .
If we fail to act on this broader agenda , initiatives for reducing greenhouse gases will be swept away by a tidal wave of population growth .
The White House has already made great strides in reversing the pernicious policies of the Bush Administration which turned a blind eye to the needs of billions .
But additional bold action is needed .
No doubt President Obama is keenly aware of the multiple dimensions of the climate challenge .
Yes , it ’s about energy .
But , more than that , it is about meeting the basic human needs of soon - to - be seven billion people .
Universal access to family planning must be a centerpiece of the climate change agenda in Copenhagen and beyond .

John Seager is president of Population Connection , America ’s grassroots population organization .
He was formerly with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and also served as chief of staff , communications director and district director for U.S. Representative Peter H. Kostmayer ( D - PA ) .
He holds a BA in Political Science from Trinity College in Hartford , Connecticut .
Uganda is likely to pass a law within months that will make homosexuality a capital offence , joining 37 other countries in the continent where American evangelical Christian groups are increasingly spreading bigotry
" Learned behaviour can be unlearned , " said David Bahati .
" You can't tell me that people are born gays .
It is foreign influence that is at work . "
Bahati has just presented his anti-homosexuality bill 2009 to Uganda 's parliament .
The bill , which will be debated within a fortnight and is expected to become law by February , will allow homosexuality to be punishable by death .
" Most people have misunderstood the bill , " Bahati told the Observer .
" The section of the death penalty relates to defilement by an adult who is homosexual and this is consistent with the law on defilement which was passed in 2007 .
The whole intention is to prevent the recruitment of under - age children , which is going on in single - sex schools .
We must stop the recruitment and secure the future of our children . "
There is wide support for Bahati's law which , while being an extreme piece of anti-gay legislation , is not unique .
As far as gay rights are concerned , it would appear that much of Africa is going backwards .
Nigeria has a similar bill waiting to reach its statute books and already allows the death penalty for homosexuality in northern states , as does Sudan .
Burundi criminalised homosexuality in April this year , joining 37 other African nations where gay sex is already illegal .
Egypt and Mali are creeping towards criminalisation , using morality laws against same - sex couples .
The Ugandan bill extends existing laws to make it illegal to promote homosexuality by talking or writing about it , and forcing people to tell the authorities about anyone they know who is gay .
The bill , said Bahati , 35 , an MP from the ruling party , aims to " protect the cherished culture of the people of Uganda against the attempts of sexual rights activists seeking to impose their values of sex promiscuity on the people of Uganda " .
He denied reports that international pressure might result in parts of the bill being toned down .
" We are not going to yield to any international pressure – we cannot allow people to play with the future of our children and put aid into the game .
We are not in the trade of values .
We need mutual respect . "
But many suspect that it was outsiders who inspired this bill in the first place .
In March , Bahati met several prominent anti-gay US Christian activists who attended a conference in Uganda where they pledged to " wipe out " homosexuality .
The conference featured Scott Lively , president of California 's anti-gay Abiding Truth Ministries and co-author of The Pink Swastika , a book claiming that leading Nazis were gay .
Also there was Don Schmierer , on the board of Exodus International , which promotes the " ex- gay " movement , believing people can change their sexuality and be redeemed .
The third extremist evangelical to attend was Caleb Lee Brundidge , who is linked to Richard Cohen who believes that psychotherapy can " cure " homosexuality .
Bahati's bill was drawn up within weeks of the conference , but it has only just begun to cause waves within America 's powerful evangelical community .
Legalising killing gay people has triggered a bad press for the bill .
This weekend , Rick Warren , the most powerful evangelical in America , released a video statement .
" As an American pastor , it is not my role to interfere with the politics of other nations , but it is my role to speak out on moral issues , " he said , adding that the bill was " unjust , extreme and un-Christian toward homosexuals " .
" That is a remarkable statement from Warren , " said Mark Bromley , of the Council for Global Equality " But there is still a pattern of homophobia that is being replicated in many parts of Africa . "
Lively released a half - hearted condemnation : " It should be no surprise … that modern Ugandans are very unhappy that homosexual political activists from Europe and the US are working aggressively to rehomosexualise their nation . "
The Ugandan law , he said , was " unacceptably harsh " , but he praised those who drafted it .
" If the offending sections were sufficiently modified , the proposed law would represent an encouraging step in the right direction … it would deserve support from Christian believers . "
Bahati said yesterday that he regretted Warren 's retreat .
" It 's unfortunate that a man of God who has inspired many people across the world can give in to pressure and disappoint them . "
Around 85 % of Ugandans are Christian – 40 % Catholics , 35 % Anglican .
Muslims make up 12 % of the population .
In Entebbe last week , 200 religious leaders , under the powerful umbrella group Inter - Religious Council of Uganda , demanded diplomatic ties be severed with " ungodly " donor countries , including the UK , Sweden and Canada , who are " bent on forcing homosexuality on Ugandans " .
Joshua Kitakule , the council 's secretary - general , said : " Those countries should respect our spiritual values .
They should n't interfere .
All senior religious leaders have been given copies of the bill to read and educate people in churches and mosques . "
For Ugandans such as Pastor Martin Ssempa , who organises anti-gay rallies , the bill brings legitimate moral force to bear on the " corrupting influence " from western societies .
For John Bosco Nyombi , 38 , it means he is unlikely to ever see his family or his homeland again .
" I had a life , a job , a house , a car , all that is gone , " he said .
The former banker fled Uganda after a crowd of his friends were rounded up and arrested in a police raid on a Kampala gay bar .
" They were ordered to give names of others and , of course under pressure , mine was given .
I paid money to an agent and fled to the UK . "
Nyombi's first asylum bid failed and he was deported back to Uganda .
" For six months , I hid , I could n't go out , see anyone I knew .
The newspaper printed a picture of me and revealed my case and the police were trying to find me . "
Eventually , lawyers persuaded the British authorities that he was in danger and he was allowed back to England , where he now has a job as a care worker .
Ugandan newspapers often out " homos " and the bill will force many more like Nyombi to leave , said Peter Tatchell , veteran gay rights campaigner .
" In many cases , these countries are using laws imposed by the British in colonial times .
Before that , homosexuality was actually tolerated or accepted in the traditional cultures .
" The right - wing are losing the battle in the US , so they are exploiting the poverty - stricken developing world .
The response of the Commonwealth is pathetic .
Of the 80 countries who criminalise same sex- relationships around the world , over 40 of them are in the Commonwealth – where is the concern for human rights ? "
It is not just Africa where homophobia is rife – Iran and Jamaica have seen homosexuals imprisoned and attacked and many American states have laws against sodomy .
In South Africa , gay rights have advanced : its first gay pride march was held in 1995 and it has now legalised civil same - sex marriage .
But for developing nations , the attraction of right - wing organisations with dollars to spend , combined with fears over a creeping " westernisation " of societies , is increasing the demonisation of gay people .
In 2004 , Ruben del Prado , co-ordinator of the Joint United Nations programme on HIV / Aids in Uganda , was prematurely transferred out of the country after he held meetings with lesbian and gay groups about preventing HIV / Aids .
The Ugandan government later accused him of holding secret meetings with undesirable groups .
Since then , NGOs and aid officials have kept silent .
In Britain , Archbishop Rowan Williams , head of the global Anglican communion , has also kept quiet , to the outrage of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement .
Its chief executive , Rev Sharon Ferguson , said African homosexuals were being abandoned by the church .
" It 's horrendous for them , " she said .
" They are scared .
If they are in this country , they are scared for their families .
If they are in Uganda , they are living in fear of being imprisoned and beaten .
It 's no way to live .
To ignore this is against our scriptures .
It also makes the pastoral role untenable because if a gay person talks to a priest then the priest is breaking the law if they do n't report them .
" It is disgusting that Rowan Williams does n't speak out .
How far is he prepared to let this go ?
Will he say something when they start killing people ?
When the lesbian and gay population start to disappear , herded away towards another Holocaust ? "
Much of the recent anti-gay activity in Africa has been in response to the increased politicisation of gay Africans , many inspired by the introduction of civil partnerships in the west .
When Kenyan - born Daniel Chege Gichia , 39 , and Charles Ngengi , 40 , had a civil partnership ceremony in October at Islington town hall they expected little more than an exuberant reception in a north London bar and a honeymoon break in Brighton .
Instead , they triggered outrage when a reporter from the Daily Nation in Kenya broke the story to a shocked east African audience , reporting one African guest at the wedding as saying : " It is time the Kenyan community woke up to reality : some of us are gay ; Kenyans have to get over it . "
For days , Kenyan radio , newspapers and blogs fielded strong reactions .
One radio station estimated that one in 20 callers wanted to speak in defence of the couple ; the rest were full of fury and of condemnation at the couple 's " un-African " behaviour .
" When a man mounts another man , " raged a headline in the Standard , " the throne of God shakes . "
Reporters rushed to Chege 's rural home village in Murang 'a district to interview distressed relatives .
" This thing has really affected the old parents .
The mother no longer wants visitors in her homestead and the old man is no longer the same , " said neighbour Mary Muthoni , 50 .
" Gichia Gikonyo , Chege 's father , has all but lost his ability to speak ever since the pictures from the union emerged , " reported one paper .
Chege 's two brothers , Humphrey and Mwangi , reported harassment and abuse .
" People shout that the family 's wealth is paid for by homosexuality .
The family endures much , " one local woman , Lucy Wanjiru , 43 , said .
But as the wedding guest said , it also brought home to Kenyans that homosexuals exist and the government responded by saying it would hold a census " with a view to knowing their numbers so that they can be educated on safe sex " .
But while some welcomed the acknowledgment that homosexuality existed , others pointed out that a homosexual sex act can carry a 14 - year prison sentence in Kenya and wondered how many people might respond to a census .
In Uganda , the ethics and integrity minister sees the uproar surrounding the bill as positive .
Uganda was " providing leadership " to the world , said James Nsaba Buturo .
" It is with joy we see that everyone is interested in what Uganda is doing , and it is an opportunity for Uganda to provide leadership where it matters most .
So we are here to see a piece of legislation that will not only define what the country stands for , but provide leadership around the world . "
It has certainly created some religious unity .
It came as the Muslim Tabliq youth revealed plans to form what they called an anti-gay squad , to seek out and expose homosexuality .
Sheikh Multah Bukenya , a Tabliq cleric , said : " It is the work of the community to put an end to bad practices like homosexuality . "
But Gerald Sentogo , of Sexual Minorities Uganda , said the bill was inhumane .
" It violates every aspect of a human being .
I mean , you cannot tell me you will kill me because I 'm gay , " he said .
" How will somebody know about my sexuality unless he comes to my bedroom ?
You will trust nobody because everyone will become a spy over the other .
" Imagine people fighting over other issues and somebody will say you are a homosexual to get rid of you , and then you are arrested and you spend seven years in jail or life imprisonment . "
Since the 2008 election of Barack Obama , the country ’s first African American president , a wave of anger , public incivility , rising conspiracy theories and a climate of fervor has swept the nation says the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) in a new study .
The report , Rage Grows in America : Anti-Government Conspiracies finds that rumors about gun confiscation , tax policies , and extreme comparisons of the Obama administration to Nazi Germany are contributing to a toxic atmosphere of rage in America .
“ In the year since we marked the historic election of the nation ’s first African American president we have seen a tremendous amount of anger and hostility , ” said Abraham H. Foxman , ADL national director .
In a press release Foxman continues , “ There is a toxic atmosphere of rage in America being witnessed at many levels , and it raises fundamental questions for our society . ”
Foxman points out , “ While not all of America has bought into these conspiracies , they seem to be seeping more and more into the mainstream .
And since many of these expressions are interconnected in some significant ways , we wanted to try and connect the dots and ask the basic questions of why the anger , why now , and where it might lead . ”
This characterization of anti-government hostility is fueled by a shared belief that the Obama administration actually poses a threat to the future of the U.S. , says the report .
Some accuse Obama of plotting to bring socialism to the country , while others claim he is trying to bring about Nazism or fascism .
Many extremists believe Obama is instilling a sinister agenda that plans to trample on individual freedoms and civil liberties due to his economic and social policies .
Anti-government activists are using the issue of health care reform as a rallying point accusing the Obama administration of implementing dark designs ranging from “ socialized medicine ” to “ death panels . ”
Some of these assertions are motivated by prejudice , but more common is an intense strain of anti-government distrust and anger , colored by a streak of paranoia and belief in conspiracies , says the study .
Such resentment and hostility , if it continues to grow in intensity and scope , may result in an increase in anti-government extremists and the potential for a rise of violent anti-government acts .
“ The fact that these anti-government sentiments are coming from such a broad spectrum makes it more likely that some individuals will become so inflamed with anger that they will move farther toward the fringes , ” said Robert G. Sugarman , ADL national chair .
“ This could result not only in the swelling of the ranks of anti-government extremist groups and movements , but might give rise to more individuals who are willing to act on their anger , ” he said .
The report argues anti-government anger first became apparent in the spring of 2009 when conservative groups and local activists organized a nationwide series of rallies dubbed “ Tea Parties . ”
A common theme that somehow Obama had “ stolen ” the country from Americans was universal at such events .
More evidence of similar animosity appeared in the summer when a variety of protests and planned disruptions occurred at town hall meetings organized by lawmakers across the country to discuss health care reform .
Such actions became a fertile ground for anti-Obama protests and stunts with some angrily launching verbal attacks against the president .
Some explicitly compared the Obama administration and its policies to Nazi Germany and the Holocaust .
The rising tide of dissident gave a “ green light ” to anti-Obama hostility particularly when South Carolina Rep.
Joe Wilson shouted “ You lie ! ” to Obama during a live speech to Congress in September .
A large rally in Washington , D.C. against Obama ’s policies displayed racist imagery and ideas that implicitly or explicitly promoted violence .
Segments of the mainstream media have also played a surprisingly active role in generating such sentiments including most notably by radio and television host Glenn Beck .
He , along with many of his guests has made a habit of demonizing the Obama administration .
Beck has acted as “ fearmonger - in - chief , ” says the ADL , raising anxiety about and distrust towards the current government .
Other troubling expressions include the “ Birther ” movement , which rapidly spread during and after the 2008 election , targeted at Obama himself .
The so - called “ Birthers ” argue that Obama is not a legitimate president because he allegedly was not born in the U.S. ( as the Constitution requires ) , but rather in Kenya .
The report details different areas of anti-government tendencies such as : leading conspiracy theorists on social networking sites alleging dark tales of the federal government declaring martial law ; the resurgence of the militia movement , which has a long history of criminal activity ; and government resisters , groups that are promoting implicit or explicit armed resistance that have appropriated an idealized version of the Revolutionary War history for their own purposes .
The ADL , founded in 1913 , is the world ’s leading organization fighting anti-Semitism through programs and services that counteract hatred , prejudice and bigotry .

Few people outside Japan would have heard of Kyoto prior 1997 , its Katsura palace or famous spring blossom .
Mention the city now and it is immediately associated with the closest thing we have to an adequate global response to the global climate problem .
As delegates meeting in Copenhagen this month well know , the Kyoto protocol set legally binding requirements for developed economies to achieve emissions reductions by 2012 .
But the deficiencies of the protocol are also well known .
To name only three : the reductions required are small when compared to what climate science is now telling us ; the most rapidly developing economies are not required to achieve any measurable emissions reductions , and it provides no real guidance to business needing to plan for the long term .
It is n't as if the world has been blind to these deficiencies .
Since the United Nations climate conference in Bali in 2007 , over the past two years climate negotiators from more than 190 countries have been meeting to overcome these constraints and establish a more effective global climate treaty .
And this task is meant to conclude in less than 10 days at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen .
Already the Scandinavian city made famous by Hans Christian Andersen is becoming shorthand for the success or failure of our collective efforts to combat climate change .
If Copenhagen ends in " success " then we will have succeeded in avoiding the danger of global warming and climate destabilisation ; if it is a " failure " then we too will have failed to address this most wicked of problems .
If only it were so simple .
If only tools such as text and agreement actually achieved the measureable , reportable and verifiable emissions reductions that all economies must achieve over the coming years .
For Copenhagen can only be a beginning : the start to investment in modern low emissions technology and infrastructure and the imposition of costs on the old , polluting industries of the past .
The stakes at Copenhagen are high .
The peer reviewed science has only firmed since Kyoto .
There is now a consensus that the level of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that the atmosphere can bear before warming triggers unpredictable and potentially catastrophic changes to the global climate system is considerably lower .
Climate scientists who only a decade ago would have argued that the amount of greenhouse gas should be 550 parts per million , now argue that even 450 pmm may be too much .
Our understanding of the climate problem and our experience of developing effective climate policy have progressed enormously over the past twelve years .
The world is now a lot clearer about the policies and incentives that can reduce emissions , maintain economic growth and get our carbon cycle into greater balance .
Prior to 1997 no one could refer to the learning from an emissions trading system in Europe , or the rapid move to renewable energy in Germany .
And perhaps more important than all of this is how public sentiment , and with it our politics , has shifted .
Kyoto was before An Inconvenient Truth , the Stern review , hurricane Katrina , the 2003 European heatwave and Australia 's worst drought on record .
In many countries climate change is now an issue which bridges the standard political divide .
Some of the most progressive leaders on the issue come from the right of politics : Angela Merkel , Nicolas Sarkozy and even an actor turned politician not known for his warm hearted roles : Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Climate change is now a fixed agenda item for any meeting between heads of state : how to maintain economic growth , energy security and reduce emissions .
And no longer is the President of the United States sceptical of the problem : in Barack Obama the White House is occupied by a man who has made tackling climate change a core part of his political narrative .
In accounting for Kyoto 's ineffectiveness , in 1997 one could easily cite the lack of public understanding ; a lack of clarity in the science ; a lack of effective politics or an immaturity in our experience of effective climate policy .
None of these excuses now apply .
Whether the final chapter in a story that started in Bali two years ago is one of resolution and joy , or confusion and despair , remains unknown .
An unambiguous political agreement establishing how the new binding international rules can be agreed may still mean that Copenhagen becomes shorthand for describing when a new and powerful approach to tackling this most wicked of global problems was begun .
That would be cause for celebration by this and all future generations .

ISLAMABAD – Addressing a roomful of Pakistani women Friday afternoon at the National Art Gallery here , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made every effort to connect with her audience .
But after enduring multiple security checks and waiting over four hours for the secretary to arrive , most women left unimpressed .
“ Frankly , it was a waste of my time , ” said one assistant professor from the Fatima Jinnah Women ’s University ( FJWU ) in Rawalpindi , who asked not to be named .
“ [ Clinton ] was n’t interested in hearing the about the layman ’s problems or the reality of our daily lives . ”
That caused many , such as Shazia Marri , the information minister of the Sindh province , to leave the meeting frustrated that their concerns were not heard .
“ Emancipated women in Pakistan have a clear point of view that did not come across , ” she said .
The local media has described Mrs. Clinton ’s three - day visit to Pakistan as a “ charm offensive . ”
Her town - hall meeting with female activists , lawyers , journalists , parliamentarians , and businesswomen from across the country was meant to conclude the trip on a high note , particularly in the wake of Wednesday ’s car bomb attack on a Peshawar market that killed 117 – mostly women .
In her interactions with Pakistani women , Clinton tried to engage in personal - level diplomacy .
Explaining how the US would support democracy in Pakistan , Clinton discussed the importance of “ habits of the heart , ” such as tolerance and compromise , which could be ingrained within families and by teachers in schools .
Addressing concerns about aid delivery , she described how the US government organized a team of female Pakistani - American doctors to treat internally displaced women .
And in a rare digression , she reminisced about an exchange of family photographs with the late former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
Clinton attempted a relaxed manner , with an aside about having a Pakistani roommate .
But her jokes about visiting Pakistan and not discussing security for once failed to win over the crowd .
Pakistani women – much like the country ’s youth and professionals , whom Clinton met in similar meetings in Lahore on Thursday – seemed more keen on discussing security issues .
The questions that met with most applause from the audience were on US drone attacks , alleged American designs on Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal , and whether the US intended to pressure India to settle the long - standing Kashmir conflict .
Several audience members said Clinton 's answers did little to allay their concerns or skepticism .
“ The responses were as expected , ” added Ameena Saiyid , the managing director of Oxford University Press .
Many women , including Zainab Azmat , a resident of the South Waziristan tribal agency , currently lecturing at Peshawar ’s Institute of Management Sciences ( IMS ) , complained that Clinton ’s answers were too “ reserved . ”
Ms. Azmat added that the intention of the meeting was unclear .
“ Why were we here ?
What did they want us to ask ?
What did they want to convey to us ? ” she asked .
It did n’t help that many women objected to the format of the discussion , which was moderated by five female news anchors .
Before Clinton arrived , one State Department representative explained that the format aimed to imitate the popular talk show , ‘ The View . ’
But it seems the women were not all convinced that the show is what the meeting most closely mirrored .
“ This meeting was as micromanaged as our country ’s internal affairs , ” quipped the FJWU professor .
“ [ The Americans ] were trying to retain the upper - hand in the conversation . ”
Fariel Salahiddin , a financial consultant with Ministry of Information , still found the visit valuable , however .
It is " admirable that Clinton is making this effort to reach out , " she said .
Here 's the challenge : how do you illustrate , in a television report , the impact of flying on the environment ?
It is n't as easy as you might think .
Three years ago , I pondered the problem with the Ethical Man producer , Sara , for a couple of days before we had a moment of genius .
Our solution infuriated my wife , enraged my colleagues and alienated a large section of our audience but I still stand by it .
So what was this brilliant idea ?
We decided that I should illustrate the impact of flying by jetting off for a weekend in Jamaica .
I know .
That 's what my wife thought too .
And to make matters worse I filmed the moment I revealed our plans to her .
You can watch my marriage disintegrate here .

Please tell me if you think our approach was misguided .
For the record , here 's my defence .
We reasoned that if you watched our film and thought the idea of a man calling himself " ethical " flying off to Jamaica for the weekend smacked of hypocrisy , it might make you reflect on your own behaviour and consider flying less .
And , because we were keeping a tally of my carbon footprint , we reckoned the record of my flight would serve as a reminder of just how carbon - intensive flying is .
I did say this at the time but , judging by the avalanche of outraged emails we received , it fell on deaf ears .
The truth is , flying is the single most intractable climate change issue .
There is a solution to most of the other stuff - we can cut our energy use , change how we generate power , drive electric cars , eat less meat etc ... but there is no alternative to flying .
And how we love to fly .
A least one foreign holiday a year now seems to be regarded as pretty much a right of citizenship .
Which is why politicians are so worried about stopping us doing it .
Why is flying such a problem ?
Let 's start with the good news : a couple of years ago I looked into the numbers and found that modern jet aeroplanes are actually a very efficient form of transport .
The jet engine is actually one of the most effective ways to convert the energy from fuel into thrust .
The best jets are 37 % efficient .
By contrast modern petrol engines are around 25 % efficient while a finely tuned diesel will achieve , at best , 32 % efficiency .
How does that translate into actual fuel consumption ?
Take a look at some figures : my old car - a two litre petrol Saab 9 - 5 estate - uses 8.6 litres per 100 km .
The most efficient cars do better than that .
The Toyota Prius , for example , is much more frugal .
It uses 4.3l /100km .
So what about aircraft ?
The average jet plane now uses around 4.8l /100 km per passenger - just a little worse than a Prius with no passengers .
But the manufacturers say modern jets are much more efficient .
Airbus claims it makes the most efficient aeroplane currently flying , the A380 .
It says this behemoth uses just 2.9l /100 km per passenger .
( Here 's the dull bit : that 's the fuel consumption when you assume a three class configuration operating at capacity with 525 passengers . )
So far as I can tell , the latest jumbos are similarly efficient - it is hard to be certain because the manufacturers do not publish comparable figures - but Boeing 's 747- 8 uses 3.7l /100 km per passenger when operating at 70 % capacity .
( Assuming it is configured to hold 470 passengers in three classes . )
So , if jet engines are more efficient than car engines why do they get such a bad rap ?
The anwer is pretty obvious - we use planes to travel extremely long distances .
That weekend in Jamaica racked up just over 15,000 km .
That 's pretty much what the average British driver would do in an entire year .
The other problem is that planes release their pollutants high up in the atmosphere where they have an even stronger greenhouse effect .
The process is known as radiative forcing and means aircraft emissions are reckoned to be almost twice as damaging as emissions at ground level .
So , combine the distance you fly with the effect of radiative forcing and you can see why our appetite for air travel is so worrying .
You can do as I did - get rid of your car , switch to energy efficient bulbs , eat locally grown food - but take one holiday flight and you will erase all your careful carbon cuts .
So what are the alternatives ?
Here 's the rub .
As my figures show , even if you did take the car instead of the plane you would still emit huge amounts of carbon , because of the vast distances covered in most journeys by air .
I 've already done the maths on trains and buses .
If you pack them full of passengers they will offer some carbon savings but , like cars , they leave the tricky little challenge of crossing oceans .
Boats will do that job but there 's a hefty carbon price to pay there too .
And these alternatives ignoring perhaps the most important feature of flying : it is extremely fast .
Lots of environmentalists regard speed as some kind of crime but much ( not all ) time spent travelling is time not spent doing something else - often a productive activity .
So there is an economic cost to slow travel .
So what 's the answer ?
It 's a tough one is n't it ?
Do write in if you 've got any good ideas .
In the meantime how about this : establish a price system that accurately reflects the impact that carbon emissions have on the environment ?
That way the price of a plane ticket would include all the costs of our holiday .
It would mean we would all fly less , of course .
But , given the problems my weekend in Jamaica caused me , maybe that would not be such a bad thing .

Lloyds Banking Group was facing a furious backlash from customers last night after announcing it would ask the courts to strike out thousands of legal claims against it just two days after a landmark legal judgment in the overdraft fees case .
The bank , which , following a series of government bailouts is now 43 per cent - owned by the taxpayer , was accused of acting with indecent haste following a judgment handed down on Wednesday by the Supreme Court , which said the Office of Fair Trading was not entitled to investigate the fairness of unauthorised borrowing fees .
There was particular surprise that the bank leading the charge to snuff out compensation claims is an institution that had to be partly nationalised in order to save it from collapse following the credit crisis .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" It is disappointing that the ink is barely dry on the judgment and Lloyds is already rushing to do this , " said Adam Williams , principal campaigner at the consumer group Which ?
" We very much doubt whether they would have moved so quickly had the judgment gone the other way , given how they have dragged their feet throughout this affair . "
Martin Lewis , of Moneysavingexpert.com – one of the leaders of a campaign for a refund of bank charges for up to 8 million people caught out after exceeding overdraft limits – said customers were not being given time to consider their position .
Mr Lewis , whose group has hired a leading banking QC to investigate potential alternative routes to redress for customers , said : " What I find disingenuous is that Lloyds knows we are taking legal advice .
One hopes the bank is not trying to capitalise on its time advantage , because that would be invidious . "
Lloyds is the first bank to have responded to Wednesday 's ruling with legal action .
Yesterday , it argued that the ruling against the OFT effectively invalidated most of the complaints made against it by customers seeking a refund of unauthorised borrowing fees already levied .
As a result , it is to ask the courts to dismiss all complaints filed using the sort of standard template letters that millions of people have downloaded from the internet , or adapted from models published in newspapers such as The Independent – which has fought for compensation for bank customers .
The bank published a statement on its LloydsTSB and HBOS websites pointing out that the chief City regulator , the Financial Services Authority , had lifted its temporary freeze on complaints about overdraft charges .
" We will be asking the county and Sherriff Courts to apply the principles of the Supreme Court judgment and for cases to be withdrawn where appropriate , " the bank added .
Banking industry sources said that other current - account providers were likely to follow Lloyds ' lead , with executives from across the sector now in talks about a common approach , but there was widespread surprise that one bank had chosen to move so speedily .
Michelle Slade , of the personal finance group Moneyfacts , said : " Lloyds has not wasted much time : there are already a lot of people annoyed about the judgment in this case and the speed of this is going to annoy people even further . "
A spokesman for the Office of Fair Trading said that it had not yet ruled out a fresh legal challenge to unauthorised borrowing charges .
" We are still considering our position , " he said .
" This is a matter for the banks , but it may not be possible for the courts to strike out these cases en masse , because they are all individual cases . "
County court judges have been issued with no guidance by the Supreme Court on how they should interpret Wednesday 's judgment , though they have been told to wait to see whether the banks and their customers come to some form of agreement .
However , legal experts say the ruling will make it very difficult for the complaints to succeed , because they were filed on the assumption that it was possible for regulators to investigate unfair charges .
The Financial Ombudsman Service has also warned that it will now have to reject many of the complaints made to it about bank charges .
Lloyds is the UK 's biggest provider of current accounts and overdrafts , with its market lead having been cemented by the takeover in September of the Halifax Bank of Scotland Group .
That deal was cleared by the competition authorities because it was seen as a rescue of HBOS , which had come under huge pressure at the height of the credit crunch .
It emerged earlier this week that HBOS had to borrow £ 25.4bn in emergency funding from the Bank of England last November in order to continue trading .
Lloyds Banking Group eventually benefited from an injection of billions of pounds of public money as part of a recapitalisation plan designed to put it on an even keel , leaving the taxpayer with a 43.4 per cent stake in it .
It is currently in the process of raising more than £ 13bn from shareholders – including £ 5.7bn from the Government – further to shore up its finances in what will be the UK 's largest ever rights issue .
Athletics South Africa ( ASA ) has called on the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) to apologize for the treatment of one of their athletes Caster Semenya .
Semenya , 18 who the won 800 m gold medal was thrust into the public spotlight when she won and a controversy over her gender erupted .
The IAAF forced Semenya to undergo a test to determine her sex , which resulted in the report that Semenya is intersex and has internal testes responsible for her higher levels of testosterone .
The IAAF did not adhere to the human rights of the athlete and did not keep her confidentiality in mind .
" The ASA Council noted with concern that , contrary to its position as the custodian of athletics in the world , the IAAF did not follow its constitution and procedures in dealing with the matter , failed to observe the confidentiality required to handle the matter of this sensitivity ; and the human rights of the athlete , " read the minutes of the meeting .
The ASA concluded : " The Council therefore called on the IAAF to apologise to the athlete , her family and the people of South Africa " ( Guardian ) .
Urge the IAAF to apologize to Caster Semenya for their way of handling the situation .
Apparently , this is what “ an unprecedented level of openness in Government ” looks like :

One of the core philosophies of Google , and one of the reasons it has been so successful , is efficiency .
It 's about both being as efficient as possible when serving search results and processing data and creating product that push the limits of efficiency for the user ( as an example , Google 's trying to make communication more efficient with Google Wave ) .
Maybe that 's why we 're not surprised that Google is finally looking to tackle the underpinning code that runs the web .
Today the search giant released Go , an open - source development language that Google believes will combine performance with speed , and one that the company probably hopes will reshape the development and software industries in its favor .
Go is based on the C programming family , one of the most widely used programming language trees in the world .
However , the twist is that incorporates elements of Python ( a preferred development language within Google ) and the Pascal / Modula / Oberon family to make faster and more dynamic programs .
Why Did Google Make Its Own Language ?
In its Go FAQ , Google explains the main motivations behind the project :
" No major systems language has emerged in over a decade , but over that time the computing landscape has changed tremendously .
There are several trends : - Computers are enormously quicker but software development is not faster .
- Dependency management is a big part of software development today but the “ header files ” of languages in the C tradition are antithetical to clean dependency analysis — and fast compilation .
-
There is a growing rebellion against cumbersome type systems like those of Java and C++ , pushing people towards dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript .
-
Some fundamental concepts such as garbage collection and parallel computation are not well supported by popular systems languages .
-
The emergence of multicore computers has generated worry and confusion . "
Summary : Google believes that the web and computing have changed dramatically in the last ten years , but the languages powering that computing have not .
But when you get down to it , Google could benefit a great deal from not only having a more efficient programming language , but having one it designed being used in thousands web and software apps .
If you want to learn more , Google ( as usual ) has released a detailed , hour - long Google Tech Talk on the new language ( embedded below ) .
However , if you 're a developer and just want to get started , we suggest checking out the Go Tutorial and writing your first program .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday 29 October 2009
In the report below on the controversy over Metropolitan police plans to make firearms officers available to commanders for duties in five London boroughs , we said these officers would carry submachine guns .
The Met points out that the weapon in question is the single - shot variation of the Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun ( the MP5SF ) .
What we should have said , therefore , is that the officers would be carrying semi-automatics .
Metropolitan police plans for units armed with submachine guns to patrol areas of London plagued by violent drug gangs have thrown the capital 's police authority into turmoil .
In a break with the traditional image of the unarmed bobby on the beat , a team of 18 constables , led by an inspector and two sergeants , will be deployed to serve as a deterrent to gangs in heavy crime areas such as Brixton and Haringey .
The officers - some on motorbikes - will be armed with Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns capable of firing up to 800 rounds a minute and Glock semi-automatic pistols .
The new unit will come from within CO19 , the specialist firearms unit that provides armed support for their unarmed colleagues .
CO19 is normally called out when there is a need for armed police , but the new unit will adopt more aggressive tactics .
" CO19 has traditionally provided a response to gun crime , " said acting chief superintendent Andy Tarrant .
" This new unit sees a move towards a more proactive approach to deal with weapons and people linked to violence on our streets . "
The suggestion of a routine and permanent firearms presence on British streets has angered London 's police authority , with members demanding to know how changes to the central philosophy of British policing could have been made without wide consultation .
On hearing of the disclosure , Catherine Crawford , the chief executive of the Metropolitan Police Authority – which is responsible for strategic issues within the Met – emailed members .
" This is just to let you know that this is not a proposal on which the authority is sighted and we are making urgent enquiries of the Met , " she said .
Jennette Arnold , a Labour MPA member , said : " We have spent years working on relations between the communities I represent and the police and – thanks to this hard work – they have never been better .
All that hard work might as well be thrown away and the contract between the community and the police torn up if this is the future of policing in London .
" No one asked us or the people I represent if this was acceptable and when they do I shall tell them it is n't .
It is n't acceptable to throw away the principle of policing by consent .
I will fight this tooth and nail . "
The way the Met plan has come to light will reignite the debate about who runs the police in London .
Sir Paul Stephenson moved to assert his authority last month after Boris Johnson 's policing adviser Kit Malthouse boasted that the mayor and his political administration had their " hands on the tiller " .
At the same time , the mayor will be forced to take political responsibility unless he can show that the capital 's problems with guns and gangs are being kept in check .
Gun-related crime in London has risen year - on - year with the number of gun crimes in September alone up from 230 last year to 300 this year – a 30 % rise .
Earlier this month it emerged that the number of so - called war wound shootings in which gang members shoot each other in the legs for " disrespecting " them more than doubled to 72 already in 2009 compared with last year .

I am convinced that this kind of nation - building at home is exactly what Mr. Obama is trying to deliver , and should be his unifying call :
We need universal health care because it would strengthen our social fabric and enable our businesses to better compete globally .
We need to upgrade our schools because no child in 21st - century America should be left behind and because we cannot compete for the best new jobs without doing so .
We need a greener economy , not just to mitigate climate change , but because a world growing from 6.7 billion people to 9.2 billion by 2050 is going to demand more and more clean energy and water , and the country that develops the most clean technologies is going to have the most energy security , national security , economic security , innovative companies and global respect .
But to deliver this agenda requires a motivated public and a spirit of shared sacrifice .
That ’s where narrative becomes vital .
People have to have a gut feel for why this nation - building project , with all its varied strands , is so important  why it ’s worth the sacrifice .
One of the reasons that independents and conservatives who voted for Mr. Obama have been so easily swayed against him by Fox News and people labeling him a “ socialist ” is because he has not given voice to the truly patriotic nation - building endeavor in which he is engaged .
“ Obama ’s election marked a shift  from a politics that celebrated privatized concerns to a politics that recognized the need for effective government and larger public purposes .
Across the political spectrum , people understood that national renewal requires big ambition , and a better kind of politics , ” said the Harvard political theorist Michael Sandel , author of the new best seller 
“ Justice : What ’s the Right Thing to Do ? ”  that calls for elevating our public discourse .
But to deliver on that promise , Sandel added , Obama needs to carry the civic idealism of his campaign into his presidency .
He needs a narrative that will get the same voters who elected him to push through his ambitious agenda  against all the forces of inertia and private greed .
“ You ca n’t get nation - building without shared sacrifice , ” said Sandel , “ and you cannot inspire shared sacrifice without a narrative that appeals to the common good  a narrative that challenges us to be citizens engaged in a common endeavor , not just consumers seeking the best deal for ourselves .
Obama needs to energize the prose of his presidency by recapturing the poetry of his campaign . ”

Ontmoetingsplaats voor de Belgische surrealisten

Precies tien jaar voor de opening van het museum aan het Koningsplein en na zeven jaar restaureringswerken , werd op 5 juni 1999 een kleingeopend in de135 te .
Het Art Nouveau - herenhuis , waar Magritte een groot deel van zijn leven verbleef , werd gerestaureerd dankzij de inbreng van de gemeente , de Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie , de Koning Boudewijnstichting en twee Antwerpse kunstkenners .
Wie denkt rationeel gezien meer inzicht in de kunst vante zullen verwerven met een bezoek , komt van een kale reis terug .
Zei de schilder zelf niet :
 Hoe minder er echt verklaard wordt , hoe intrigerender de kunst ?
Dus veel verklaringen voor de symboliek die zijn werk kenmerkt vindt men hier niet .
Wél zal er een belletje rinkelen als men ziet hoe Magritte een groot aantal details uit zijn huiselijke omgeving in zijn oeuvre verwerkte .
Er zijn natuurlijk de voor de hand liggende wereldberoemde voorwerpen als de bolhoed , de pijp of de paraplu , maar terwijl je door het huis op ontdekkingstocht trekt zul je ook andere motieven zien die in zijn schilderijen opduiken als de schoorsteen ( La durée poignardée ) , de schildersezel , het schuifvenster , de dubbele glazen deur , de trap met hoofdbaluster , paardenbelletjes , deurkrukken enzomeer .
De lantaarn die  Het Rijk der Lichten kenmerkt kun je trouwens op het voetpad voor het huis bekijken .
Wat opvalt zijn de uitgesproken kleuren waarin de kamers geschilderd zijn en die ondubbelzinnig verwijzen naar de surrealistische stijl van de schilder .
De voorplaats , die gebruikt werd om belangrijk bezoek te ontvangen , is elektrisch  blauw , de slaapkamer groen en de zolderkamer , die als logeerkamer voor de vrienden dienst deed , paars .
Uitgesproken kleuren die zeker in de jaren dertig van de vorige eeuw als revolutionair werden beschouwd .
De door Magritte ontworpen meubels in de slaapkamer zijn trouwens bloedrood .
Magritte , die afkomstig was uit het Henegouwse Lessen , verbleef op zeven verschillende adressen in Brussel .
In Jette zelf woonde hij net na zijn huwelijk in 1922 in de Ledeganckstraat .
Na drie jaar Parijs keerde hij naar de gemeente terug om er met zijn vrouw Georgette van 1930 tot 1954 in de Esseghemstraat te gaan wonen .
Het appartement paste hem perfect omdat hij absoluut een gelijkvloers wou voor zijn hond .
Het was in de ( kleine ) vrij donkere keuken dat hij belangrijke werken schilderde alsen .
Hij startte er ook met de fresco - ontwerpen voor het casino van Knokke , experimenteerde met vorm en kleur , kenmerkend voor zijn ( Hongersnood , foto ) , en ontwierp mode - en boekillustraties .
Van de zowat 1100 schilderijen en 500 gouaches die hij maakte , ontstonden er meer dan de helft naast de kolenkachel .
Vele schilderijen zal je er jammer genoeg niet aantreffen op werken uit de Vache - periode na , wel van minder bekend werk zoals enkele ondeugende erotische aquarellen , een dertigtal tekeningen en gouaches .
Hoewel Magritte een atelier had aan de achterkant van de tuin , gaf hij er de voorkeur aan achteraan in de eetkamer aan zijn schilderijen te werken .
In het atelier waar er veel meer daglicht binnenstroomde , werkte hij hoofdzakelijk aan publiciteitswerken om zijn inkomen te verhogen .
Hij gebruikte het tevens als stockeringsruimte .
Op de andere verdiepingen vindt men nu het documentaire gedeelte van het huis als daar zijn publicitaire pamfletten , telegrammen , brieven ( waaronder de correspondentie met Amerikaanse galerijhouders ) , fotos , tekeningen , affiches en allerlei curiosa die aansluiten bij zijn werk .
Niet alleen was deze woning een kwarteeuw de verblijfplaats van de schilder , tevens gold het als de ontmoetingsplaats bij uitstek voor de .
Samen met vrienden - surrealisten organiseerde hij er happenings .
Vandaar dat er ook een kamer gewijd is aan surrealistische kunstenaars als Mariën , Delvaux , Baes , Graverol en Mesens .
Wie wil weten in welke omgeving Magritte een groot aantal meesterwerken creëerde , de sfeer wil opsnuiven die zijn werk vorm gaf , kan het huis van woensdag tot en met zondag bezoeken van 10 uur tot 18 uur .

In collaboration with the BBC , who kindly provided a HD episode of R&D TV , the researchers of P2P - Next will use this experiment to gather user feedback and demonstrate that the technology will allow video to be streamed to the public , by the public .
If successful , following further optimization the technology will allow everyone with a standard Internet connection to stream high definition video to thousands of people without having to invest in additional hardware or bandwidth .
“ Our ambition level is to craft the next - generation of P2P technology , ” P2P - Next scientific director , Dr. Johan Pouwelse , told TorrentFreak .
“ We hope that our Open Source P2P technology can provide existing user - generated video communities with high quality streaming video . ”
Indeed , with this BitTorrent - powered streaming technology it should be fairly easy to create a mashup between The Pirate Bay and YouTube .
Thanks to BitTorrent the users take care of the bandwidth , which significantly reduces the costs involved with running a video streaming site .
The current trial is limited to Windows users only , but the streaming plugin will also be available for other platforms in the near future .
In order to stream the episode directly from the trial website , users have to install a plugin first , then the R&DTV episode should start to play .
Pouwelse further encourages those who are able to participate in the trial to submit feedback and report bugs .
As the technology is only in an early stage of development , problems with some video cards are expected to occur , but it should work fine with the majority .
Those who want to participate can check out the BitTorrent - powered episide of BBC ’s R&DTV here .
Details on the number of users connected and the bandwidth transferred can be found on the statistics page .
We always knew “ support the troops ” did n’t really mean anything to Republicans .
It was a slogan , nothing more .
And , that ’s being confirmed by Senator Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) who is using the anonymous “ hold ” procedure in the Senate to prevent action on a bill designed to support veterans .
Usually , these “ holds ” are secret , but the veterans have outed Coburn :
Thirteen major military and veterans groups have joined forces to try to force one senator — Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma — to release a hold that he has placed on a major veterans benefits bill .
Coburn has been identified by Senate aides as the lawmaker preventing consideration of S 1963 , the Veterans ’ Caregiver and Omnibus Health Benefits
Act of 2009 , by using an informal but legal practice of putting a hold on a bill .
Maybe the Democrats should file a cloture motion on S. 1963 to force the GOP caucus to choose between Coburn and the vets .
A bug in the latest version of the Google Chrome browser could leak the identity of users trying to surf anonymously , developers warn .
The flaw means that domain - name queries are made by a user 's local network even when Chrome is configured to used a third - party proxy .
Users typically use proxies to conceal their local IP address in an attempt to browse anonymously .
When the feature is set up , domain - name queries are supposed to be funneled through the proxy , rather than being made by a user 's local network .
" This presents a serious risk for the users of the services such as Tor , as their DNS data and the little anonymity they have with Tor is leaked outside and in the clear , " according to an advisory published Monday on the Full - Disclosure mailing list .
Short for the onion router , Tor is a free service that routes internet connections through an unpredictable series of IP addresses to prevent the true source of a user 's connection from being detected .
It is used by configuring a browser or other internet - facing application to use an IP address that belongs to the Tor project .
Those using Chrome 3.0.195.33 , the most recent version of the Google browser , receive no such protection .
There seems to be some confusion about what 's causing the bug .
According to the Full - Disclosure advisory , a feature known as DNS pre-fetching , which is enabled by default , is responsible for the loss of anonymity .
But some developers participating in this discussion in a forum for Google 's open - source Chromium browser say the vulnerability exists even when pre-fetching is disabled .
It 's unclear when the hole might be patched .
" We 're looking into fixing this issue , " a Google spokesman said , " but it only potentially impacts a very small number of people who make use of anonymity services like Tor . "
Those looking for more dependable anonymous browsing are better off using Firefox in concert with the Torbutton . ®
I live on the Internet .
I work on the Internet .
I keep in touch with my friends on the Internet .
Without the Internet , I 'm out of business , and I 'm not the only one .
But lately , with my rock - solid AT&T DSL connection ( 6Mbit/sec. down , 512Kbit/sec. up ) , I 've taken it for granted .
That was before my connection went sour and I rediscovered just how miserable life can be without a good network connection .
Last Friday , my network connection started turning on me .
It never completely failed .
Instead , it started torturing me with a thousand cuts of minor slowdowns and nagging latency delays .
By Saturday morning , my network connection was down to dial - up modem speeds of 32 K bit / sec .
Imagine trying to run a hundred - yard dash in knee - deep mud and you have an excellent idea of how I 've felt over the last few days .
Instead of getting my work done , I 've been working with AT&T on getting my Internet connection back into shape .
It has n't been easy .
I 'm falling behind in my real work and my connection is still having fits .
It could have been worse , though .
Yes , I rely on the Internet to do my job , but I do n't rely on network - based applications .
I use the Web , instant messaging and e-mail constantly .
But I do n't write stories using Google Docs , manage projects with SharePoint Online or use Salesforce for CRM ( customer relationship management ) .
If I did , I would n't just be angry and miserable ; I might well be on my way to being out of a job as well .
You see , I can still get some work done even with a crippled Internet connection .
I write my stories with OpenOffice 3.1 , I use QuickBooks for both accounting and project management , and I keep my calendar and manage my contacts with Evolution .
By keeping my mission - critical applications on my local servers , I 'm still able to keep going .
What about you ?
If your business Internet connection were crippled and running at 5 % of its usual speed , could you keep going ?
If you 've moved your business 's core software to SaaS ( software as a service ) , I doubt it .
It 's handy to run your applications remotely .
But that 's not to say I 'm a Luddite .
Indeed , I was helping run the Internet , or at least some of the parts of it belonging to NASA , when a T1 , with its 1.544Mbit/sec.
speed , was considered remarkably fast .
But I 've never been comfortable with relying on the Internet for vital applications .
Of course , you have to have the Internet for e-mail and the like , but does that mean that it's a smart idea to put all your IT eggs into the Internet basket ?
I do n't think so .
If you do -- and some companies have outsourced all their applications remotely -- you 're always one backhoe cut away from having your business knocked out for a day or so .
But that 's easy .
At least with an incident like that you know where the problem is and how to fix it .
What about a situation like mine where there is no clear , easy - to - spot , easy - to - fix problem ?
Then you can go for days and days with the IT heart of your business stilled and dead .
This is no way to run a business .
Whether you call it Web - based computing , SaaS or , the latest buzz term , cloud computing , it all comes down to putting your IT assets out of your control and one thin wire away from complete failure .
It 's cheaper in the short run , and some of it is necessary , but , as the last few days have reminded me , you really should n't rely on an Internet connection for your core work .
In the long run something will go wrong , and when it does , all of your IT cost savings may be lost in a few days of total business shutdown .
Consider yourself warned .
Steven J. Vaughan - Nichols has been writing about technology and the business of technology since CP / M - 80 was cutting - edge and 300 bit / sec. was a fast Internet connection -- and we liked it !

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The European Union called on the United States on Tuesday to play a bigger role in combating climate change , after Sweden described the Copenhagen summit last week as a “ great failure . ”

Following a meeting in Brussels to discuss how to rescue the Copenhagen climate process , EU environment ministers emphasized the need for concrete , legally binding measures to combat global warming .
The European Union went to Copenhagen with the hope of achieving a broad commitment to at least a 20 - percent cut in carbon emissions below 1990 levels within 10 years , but that and other firm goals failed to emerge in the final accord .
The two - week , United Nations - led conference ended on Saturday with a non-legally binding agreement to limit global warming to a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial times , but did not lay out how to achieve that .
Despite months of preparation and strenuous diplomacy , the talks boiled down to an inability of the world ’s two largest emitters , the United States and China , to agree fixed targets .
“ Expectations and pressure on the United States have risen after Copenhagen ... to really deliver , ” Swedish Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren told a news briefing on Tuesday after Sweden , as EU president until December 31 , chaired pan -EU talks .
Ministers from the EU ’s 27 member states will meet again in January to discuss what role the EU can play in cobbling together a stronger agreement .
DASHED PLANS
The bloc went to Copenhagen with a unified position and a plan for financing emissions cuts in the developing world , with a commitment to spend around 7 billion euros ( $ 10 billion ) over the next three years to aid poorer countries .
But those aims were largely sidelined as the talks failed to produce a breakthrough .
Carlgren described the summit as a “ disaster ” and a “ great failure , ” despite what he called Europe ’s united efforts .
“ Europe never lost its aim , never , never came to splits or different positions , but of course this was mainly about other countries really ( being ) unwilling , and especially the United States and China , ” Carlgren said .
Britain on Monday blamed China and a handful of other countries of holding the world to ransom by blocking a legally binding treaty at Copenhagen , stepping up a blame game that has gathered momentum since the talks ended .
In a sharply worded response , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu rejected accusations that China had “ hijacked ” the climate talks and added : “ The statements from certain British politicians are plainly a political scheme . ”
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the summit as “ at best flawed and at worst chaotic ” and demanded an urgent reform of the process to try to reach a legal treaty when talks are expected to resume in Germany next June .
But Danish Climate Minister Connie Hedegaard , who quit as president of the talks midway through after being criticized by African countries for favoring wealthier nations in negotiations , said there was no point in getting depressed .
“ What we need to do is to secure the step that we took and turn it into a result , ” she told reporters as she arrived for the Brussels meeting on Tuesday .
Asked whether Copenhagen had been a failure , she replied :
“ It would have been a failure if we had achieved nothing .
But we achieved something -- a first step .
“ It was the first time we held a process where all the countries were present , including the big emitters . ”
As this Spider - Man tale opens , the audience sees New York City “ on fire and in ruins ” as “ a section of the Brooklyn Bridge ascends with Mary Jane bound and dangling helplessly from the bridge . ”
Soon thereafter , a new villainess called Arachne flies into the picture spinning her own deadly trap , and as Spider - Man battles all kinds of criminals he ’s swinging right over the audience .
It sounds like the 3 - D opening for the next “ Spider - Man ” sequel , and even though this superhero story is filled with Hollywood - style special effects , it is instead a glimpse from a confidential script of a planned “ Spider - Man ” musical -- the priciest undertaking , and among the most troubled productions , in Broadway history .
Theater producers are always looking for the next movie - inspired musical blockbuster , and the pedigree of “ Spider - Man : Turn Off the Dark ” could n’t be more stellar : Sony ’s three Peter Parker movies have grossed nearly $ 2.5 billion worldwide , musical songwriters Bono and the Edge have shipped more than 50 million U2 records domestically , and director Julie Taymor ’s “ The Lion King ” has earned $ 3.6 billion globally .
But rather than develop into a surefire hit , “ Spider - Man ” the musical instead has turned into a tangled web of production delays , unpaid bills and costly theater renovations that even Peter Parker ’s alter ego would struggle to escape , according to interviews with half a dozen people close to the show who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the show and its finances .
Given its immodest ambition to “ reinvent Broadway , ” the musical ’s budget has soared to $ 52 million , counting theater renovations , according to one person familiar with its finances -- more than double the cost of 2006 ’s “ Lord of the Rings ” musical , one of the most expensive musicals ever .

Like any compelling superhero story , “ Spider - Man ’s ” real - life final act is a cliffhanger .
Despite all the talent in its corner , it ’s still far from certain when -- or even if -- the elaborate musical will open after six years of development , as it has struggled to find a backer to close the budget shortfall .
If the show does n’t premiere by the end of April , it not only will miss Tony Award eligibility but also face the expiration of the musical ’s license from Marvel Entertainment , whose comic - book division created the enduring superhero in 1962 .
Bono and Edge seem bewildered by the show ’s odyssey .
“ But who cares ? ” Bono said .
“ The visuals and the music are amazing , and that ’s what will matter . ”
While many factors have contributed to the show ’s holdup , the musical has been derailed by some of the most complicated staging in Broadway history , as the show ’s creators try to replicate the superhero ’s skyscraper - swinging movie maneuvers inside a theater .
Three people close to the production say the musical needs to raise as much as $ 24 million to cover its proposed budget of about $ 52 million -- $ 42 million for the show , $ 6 million for theater renovations and $ 4 million for theater restorations .
At the same time , “ Spider - Man ’s ” fixed weekly running costs total around $ 1 million -- hundreds of thousands dollars more than what some elaborate shows such as “ Mary Poppins ” or “ West Side Story ” cost to stage every week .
Part of “ Spider - Man ’s ” expense stems from its aerial and scenic effects :
More than 40 stage hands are needed to operate the musical ’s backstage rigging , said a person who ’s seen the show ’s budget .

Those expenses mean “ Spider - Man ” would have to sell out every show for as many as four years ( a feat only a handful of Broadway shows ever manage ) simply to break even , according to several people familiar with the production and its finances .
The show has its devoted believers , led by Chicago lawyer David Garfinkle , who has been involved in the project from the start .
It ’s easy to understand the enthusiasm : A reading of the musical ’s script -- along with listening to an hour of unreleased music by Bono and the Edge and reviewing a DVD sent to potential investors of Taymor ’s staging tests -- reveals why so many people have worked so long to see this show through .

Tough web to weave
Advertisement
From the very first page of the “ Spider - Man ” script , it ’s evident this is hardly the kind of musical you could stage in just any theater -- it makes “ The Phantom of the Opera ’s ” crashing chandelier look like a simple summer stock trick .
Throughout the script -- credited to Taymor and playwright Glen Berger , stamped “ Confidential ” on its cover and dated from this summer -- stage directions call for action sequences that at first glance seem almost impossible to stage , let alone transfer to another theater for possible touring productions .
The opening bridge scene is followed closely by the arrival of a giant web woven by Arachne , a temptress who is the musical ’s central invention .
“ A giant loom is revealed -- seven actors swing on vertical silks to form a tapestry , ” the stage directions read .
At another point , Spider - Man is so busy battling bank robbers and muggers that he multiplies into five different crime - fighting superheroes .
One of the duplicate spiders swings over the audience , landing on the balcony .
For all of the theatrical pyrotechnics , the musical ’s core story is comparatively old - fashioned , following the basic plot of the first “ Spider - Man ” movie while adding some new characters and back stories .
Advertisement
The central romance between high school students Peter Parker and neighbor Mary Jane Watson remains intact .
Parker is still bullied by his classmates and moonlights as a photographer for a New York newspaper ; moreover , he ’s torn over his unexpected transformation into a web - slinger .
As in the movie , the play ’s central villain , Green Goblin , is the genetically mutated form of scientist Norman Osborn .
The biggest departure from the movie is the musical ’s femme fatale , Arachne .
A figure cut from Greek mythology and sometimes accompanied by her own Furies , she stalks and tempts Spider - Man throughout the story as any god does a mortal .
“ We ’re linked by instinct , but you think a spider can wait ?
She exterminates deficient mates ! ” she tells Spider - Man at one point .
The music marks a departure for U2 as well .
Famous for their soaring , sometimes political rock anthems , such as “ Sunday Bloody Sunday ” and “ Pride ( in the Name of Love ) , ” Bono and Edge have crafted “ Spider - Man ” songs that are driven more by choral harmonies than lashing guitars .
Because U2 does not play in the show ( the performers are accompanied instead by a band and an orchestra ) , the songs are written for different voices ( including women ) with non -U2 arrangements .
Bono described his and Edge ’s compositions as varying from “ giant , big pop songs to noisy rock ‘ n ’ roll to ethereal shivers ” and said it was “ the easiest job we ’ve ever done when it comes to the pure joy .
Advertisement
“ For me it ’s this wonderful thing of escaping from the first - person songwriting , to disappear into these outside characters , it ’s just been a thrill of a ride , ” Bono said .
“ You spend so much time digging up diamonds in your own music ; it ’s a treat to dig in somebody ’s else ’s dirt .
To work on these songs was like a playpen . ”
Edge said he and his longtime partner were surprised that the rigidity of the musical format was actually liberating .
“ The process , ” he said , “ got more fun , exponentially , as it went on . ”

A heroic struggle

The musical ’s path to the stage has been filled with personal tragedy , and misfortune visited “ Spider - Man : Turn Off the Dark ” in a most inauspicious way -- at a 2005 signing ceremony with the Edge cementing the “ Spider - Man ” deal .
Tony Adams , a longtime colleague of movie producer Blake Edwards and a partner in theater producer Hello Entertainment , died at age 52 of a stroke as “ Spider - Man ” contracts were being signed .
Hello and Garfinkle attempted to fill Adams ’ shoes , and three people who have invested or explored investing in the show said Garfinkle needed to ( but ultimately did n’t ) bring in someone deeply experienced with day - to - day production to replace Adams and help Taymor create a show that was financially viable .
Garfinkle declined to be interviewed .
Taymor , who also declined to be interviewed , always had grand ambitions for the show .
At the outset , according to one person close to the show , she wondered if the musical even could be contained in a traditional theater .
Just as Cirque du Soleil erected custom houses for its productions in Las Vegas ( with a $ 50 - million renovation to Los Angeles ’ Kodak Theatre in the works ) , Taymor considered staging “ Spider - Man ” in a specifically designed new building .

Instead , the producers picked Broadway ’s cavernous Hilton Theatre , which had housed “ Young Frankenstein ” until it closed on Jan. 4 of this year .
The production started extensive renovations on the theater as soon as “ Young Frankenstein ” packed up , but when it later faced a money crunch , the renovations slowed down .
A number of people were n’t paid in a timely fashion , according to a person close to the show .
Some of the lead parts have been cast .
Evan Rachel Wood , who was in Taymor ’s “ Across the Universe , ” is set to play Mary Jane , with Alan Cumming as Osborn / Green Goblin and newcomer Reeve Carney , who is in Taymor ’s 2010 movie , “ The Tempest , ” as Parker / Spider - Man .
But the musical may lose them to other movies , television shows and theater productions if “ Spider - Man ” does n’t open soon .
“ Mentally , you go from thinking , ‘ I ’m going to be doing this for a year ’ to ‘ Oh , maybe that ’s not going to happen after all , ’ ” Cumming said .
The slick promotional DVD sent to woo investors showcases some of Taymor ’s staging , aerial and web - shooting tests along with the musical ’s scenic ( by “ The Little Mermaid ’s ” George Tsypin ) and costume design ( “ Bram Stoker ’s Dracula ” Oscar - winning costume designer Eiko Ishioka ) .
If the creative team can create a format to “ support the flying and fighting and stickability of Spider - Man , ” the DVD promises future investors , the show will “ redefine Broadway . ”

That ’s assuming the musical can find its missing millions ; there ’s one plan afoot to raise as much as $ 10 million by selling the income from 100 seats added to the Hilton auditorium , according to a person apprised of the idea .
No matter how appealing the “ Spider - Man ” musical might look on paper , it ’s unclear who its target ticket - buyers might be -- teenage boys and girls , the box - office drivers for the superhero movies , are hardly Broadway ’s lifeblood .
Though the hits from movie - adapted musicals can be home runs , the margin for error is thin :
For every “ Hairspray ” triumph , there ’s a “ Shrek : The Musical ” washout .
One interested party believes the money will fall into place before the end of the year : Edge , for all the setbacks , remains secure .
Said the guitarist : “ It will happen . ”

Na itt egy igazán vicces történet a szuperarrogáns Steve Jobsról .
Történt , hogy a Little App Factory levelet kapott az Apple - től : a kaliforniai cég jogászai arra kérték a vállalatot , hogy az változtassa meg az iPodRip nevű program elnevezését , az mp3 - lejátszó nevét ugyanis csak az Apple használhatja .
A cég vezetője , John Devor hosszú levélben könyörgött felmentésért az Apple - nek , de ami a legmegdöbbentőbb , hogy maga Steve Jobs válaszolt .
Ami fantasztikusan viccessé teszi a sztorit , az a két levél karakterszámának és a vele elért hatásnak az aránya .
Kezdjük Devon levelével :
Éppen ezért lenne szükségünk segítségre a márkanév megőrzésére , hogy megvédhessük vállalatunkat és a több ezer munkába fektetett órát .
Célunk , hogy megteremtsük a Mac - szoftverekkel szemben elvárható legmagasabb szintű felhasználói élményt .
A közelmúltban az iskolából is kimaradtam , csak hogy folytathassam utam Mac szoftverbirodalma felé , amihez az inspirációt ön nyújtotta nekem .
Biztos vagyok abban , hogy az Apple - nek semmilyen kárt nem okoz az iPodRip - név vagy az ikonunk használata , figyelembe véve , hogy milyen remek másodlagos szolgáltatást nyújtunk az Apple ügyfeleinek , ami az önök számára sok visszatérő vásárlót jelent .
Sőt , tudjuk , hogy az Apple supportja és a bolti alkalmazottak is előszeretettel ajánlják ezt a programot a vásárlóknak , ami szintén azt bizonyítja , hogy valamit jól csináltunk .
A nevem John Devor , a Little App Factory nevű vállalat társtulajdonosa vagyok , valamint régi részvényese és vásárlója az Apple - nek .
Valószínűleg nem tud róla , de a közelmúltban levelet kaptunk az Apple jogi osztályától , amiben arra hívták fel a figyelmünket , hogy az iPodRip - nevű programunkkal megsértettük a bejegyzett védjegyekre vonatkozó szabályozást , éppen ezért megkértek minket , hogy változtassuk meg az elnevezést .
Na és Steve válasza ?
Változtassátok meg a program nevét .
Nem nagy ügy .

A chat with Mark Duplass of “ Humpday ”
Mark Duplass , along with Joshua Leonard ( “ The Blair Witch Project ” ) , is one of the two stars of one of the funniest and just plain nicest movies I ’ve seen in awhile .
If you have n’t yet read my review , writer - director Lynn Shelton ’s Indie Spirit award - nominated “ Humpday ” is a really funny comedy about two completely heterosexual best friends who become possessed by the idea of making an art - porno in which the two of them take their bromance to its highly illogical extreme .
Duplass may be best known as one half of the film - making Duplass Brothers , who had a big indie / festival hit with “ The Puffy Chair , ” one of the most acclaimed films in the so - called “ mumblecore ” movement — improvised , usually comic , films in which no one actually mumbles much but in which the dialogue is largely improvised .
While the “ mumblecore ” tag has become more than a little dated , the Brothers D are currently completing their first movie with big - name stars ( specifically , Jonah Hill , Marisa Tomei , and John C. Reilly ) , which was without a title when this interview was conducted but we ’ve just learned via Anne Thompson is going to be named “ Cyrus . ”
“ Humpday ” technically could be considered mumblecore because , while it was for the most part tightly plotted , the dialogue was improvised .
It ’s a technique Duplass was clearly comfortable with as he has acted in the films he has been making with his brother , Jay Duplass , for over a decade , as well as in such other ‘ core hits as “ Hannah Takes the Stairs . ”
We caught up with Mark via phone a bit early in the day ( my time ) , one recent Friday morning …
PH : Just before I saw “ Humpday , ” I reviewed the DVD of “ The Odd Couple . ”
I was just thinking , now that you ’ve had time to think about the movie and everything , and we have this recently coined word “ bromance , ” which this movie obviously deals with – how do you think “ Humpday ” fits in with all these other movies that have been out there ?
MD : That ’s weird .
When we made “ Humpday ” there really was n’t the bromance movement in the zeitgeist .
We were just operating in Seattle doing our own little thing .
We were not conscious that we were part of a movement at all .
When I look back now I can see that there ’s something about the lovable loser / shlubby guy over the last five or ten years that ’s become our new hero or protagonist .
And there ’s something funny and interesting , and ultimately kind of sweet , about the burgeoning friendships that happen between these type of guys and in particular a little bit of buffoonery that comes with it .
I ca n’t say why it ’s happening now .
I definitely know that , in my own life , as I get older I look for more intimacy out of my guy friends .
I do n’t know why .
I ’m more comfortable in my own skin , I ’m more comfortable crying on dudes ’ shoulders and talking about my insecurities with guys than when I was at a keg party when I was sixteen .
I do n’t know why it ’s become such a part of the zeitgeist .
I ’m happy about it .
I like exploring it .
There ’s a sweetness to it and there ’s a comedy to it that I think is really rife for exploration and art .
PH : You said you and Joshua were basically kind of acquaintances before the movie , but now you ’re actually pretty good friends .
That happened on the film ?
MD : We ’re very close friends – he ’s one of my closest friends .
[ Before making “ Humpday ” ]
I only knew him tangentially and then Lynn said “ Look , I need help casting this role . ”
I recommended Josh , just based on knowing him a little bit .
I knew him enough to know he was a very special human being .
Very emotionally evolved – he ’s been through a lot for a guy in his early thirties , but more importantly he and I have this great dynamic .
We love each other so much and we have no real physical boundaries .
We ’re very intimate emotionally , physically but at the same time if one of us did something wrong to the other one , we would have absolutely have no problem shooting the other one in the face .
It ’s a good love / hate combo that makes for interesting acting chemistry .
PH : Do you think you guys will ever do another movie together ?
MD : We talk about it all the time .
I think we would love to .
It would be a question of the right time and the right characters .
“ Humpday ” is so special to us , if we did something we ’d want it to be something really different .
PH : I was looking at some of your earlier short films and I was curious about your acting background because you seem so comfortable in front of a camera .
Is there any aside from these movies ?
MD : There really is n’t .
Jay ’s my older brother and , since we were little , he would hold the camera and I would be in front of the camera and that ’s what we ’ve always done .
It just began as a function of the fact that I was the best free actor that he could find .
Then , as my brother and I got more serious making movies , and now we ’re making studio movies , [ and that ’s ] an artistically rewarding but also very stressful environment .
Acting has now become this sort of little safe haven for me to be truly creative and truly free and not bear the onus of the movie .
When I ’m done , I go home and I go to sleep .
When I ’m directing a movie I ’m thinking about it all the time .
It ’s a great counterbalance to my directing life .
PH : ( laughing )
You just killed one of my other questions !
MD : Alright !
PH : About the final scene .
You purposefully did n’t talk about it beforehand about what was going to happen and what you were going to do for the film ’s resolution .
Did you have a bunch of contingencies running through your head , since you did n’t know what Joshua was going to do ?
MD : Yeah .
I would n’t say “ contingencies , ” but I did have thoughts about where it could go and I did have markers of places that I thought would be interesting .
I thought for sure these guys would try out a kiss .
I felt like that was coming at some point .
PH : By the way , I ’m going to try not to give [ the ending ] away to the readers .
MD : Of course .
I did n’t really know , obviously , what was going to happen .
I had some ideas , but in general it really was a true process of exploration .
It was “ he ’s gonna walk into that hotel room and I do n’t know what the hell is gonna happen . ”
The first day we shot for an hour and about 75 to 80 percent of what you see is from that very day .
PH : Here ’s another thing .
I think it ’ s from one of the DVD commentaries , but I believe Lynn Shelton has said that you all actually did n’t know that it was going to work .
You never really know that on any movie , of course , but in this case you really came in with the idea that “ maybe this will work , maybe this won’t ” and the entire movie might be discarded and never see the light of day .
What got you to make that commitment anyway , even though you felt it was risky .
MD : It was the right time in my life .
I was just about to shoot my first studio movie with my brother .
It was a movie that I had developed for a few years and I knew we could execute perfectly .
It was right in my wheelhouse , it was everything I knew how to do well and that was very exciting to me .
The other side of that coin is wanting to do something that was really at risk of failing and the feelings that brought out in me ….
“ Humpday ” was a little bit of me regressing back to how I felt when I was 19 or 20 making art movies .
“ It could be really cool ; we ’re probably going to fuck it up , but let ’s give it a shot anyway . ”
There ’s a vitality to that ; it was the right time in my life .
PH : So you wanted to get back on the high - wire again ?
MD : Yeah , I wanted to get on the hire - wire again .
PH : You ’ve brought me very nicely to the next question .
Now , the movie with your brother you were referring to , this is the one with Jonah Hill ?
Do you have a title for that yet ?
MD : We do not have a title yet , but we ’ll probably have one in about two days .
We ’re all getting through all the best options right now and trying to decide what that ’s going to be .
But , yeah , we ’re still working on that .
It ’s really become a special kind of a thing .
Everyone has been so supportive and they love it so much , and so do we and we ’re being very careful about when we release it and what title we use and we really want to do it right .
PH : As I understand it , Marisa Tomei plays his mother and John C. Reilly is her new boyfriend .
What ’s it like working with that kind of actor , as opposed to the the sort of stock company you ’ve built - up with the so - called “ mumblecore ” films .
MD : Creatively speaking , very , very similar .
They had seen all of our movies and we only brought them on board because they wanted to make a movie like this .
They wanted to improvise ; they wanted to go explore .
And so , creatively speaking , we really were on that level .
But , I gotta say , and I did not expect this , there is something to working with quote - unquote “ professional actors . ”
These people are fucking good .
They are good at their job .
I was cocky and thought “ me and my friends , we know what we ’re doing , we ’re fine . ”
There is something to working with professionals .
There is a reason these people make the money they do and get the praise that they do .
Particularly , Jonah is … there ’s a whole new side to Jonah .
It ’s a completely different character than he ’s ever played .
And it ’s really , really special .
We ’ve always known he ’s a special kid ; we ’ve known him for quite a bit socially .
We ’ve been looking for something that can break him out of just the teenage roles that he ’s played before , and we feel like this is it for him .
PH : I ’ve seen some more potential in him more recently .
His part in “ Forgetting Sarah Marshall ” was something that seemed a little bit beyond what we ’ve been seeing .
MD : He ’s got it .
PH : Getting back to “ Humpday , ” It kind of fits into this broad category that ’s been called “ mumblecore ” and I ’m kind of curious because I was kind of pleasantly surprised since I ’ve started seeing the movies … you guy ’s do n’t actually mumble !
MD : I do n’t think we mumble either .
I think it was very nice to have that movement in , say , 2005 when my brother and myself , Jo Swanberg , Andrew Bujalski , and a handful of other filmmakers – Ti West , who made “ House of the Devil ” … We were making $ 10,000 movies on our little cameras and it was great that The New York Times gave a name to our movement , to whatever .
They gave us reviews and it brought awareness to us .
PH : Was it The New York Times who coined the word ?
MD : I do n’t know who actually termed it , but they sort of broke it out .
And that was great and we needed that attention , but fortunately we ’ve all evolved as filmmakers and the styles have evolved and the technology has evolved .
So , we ’re a little bit out of that movement and the press still wants to use that word .
I think it ’s outlived it ’s usefulness , unfortunately .
But I ’m glad that it was out there for awhile because it did help to launch our careers a bit .
PH : It ’s interesting because the first one I saw was “ Hannah Takes the Stairs ” and I thought , “ this is pretty written , ” which brings me to a question I want to ask you about “ Humpday ” and this may be more of a question for Lynn , but this move feels written .
It feels like one of those movies were afterward people ask if the dialogue was improvised and they say “ no it was n’t , but that was because we did our jobs so well it felt like people were making it up as they went . ”
Why do you think it feels so tight even though you really were improvising the dialogue ?
MD : The editor , Nat Sanders , is unbelievable at trimming fat and Lynn as well is very good about knowing that we want to stick to the narrative and not go off blabbing about things .
But I also gotta give credit to Alycia [ Delmore , who plays Anna , Ben ’s highly tolerant wife and does so extremely well ] , Josh , and myself for knowing that just because you ’re improvising does n’t mean you can talk about bullshit for an hour .
We were improvising the narrative and you have to keep the actor - brain on but also a writer - brain .
So , while you ’re inside the scene you ’re driving the story and throwing out little surprises to keep things on track .
If you feel things going off track , you have to spin it back and make sure you ’re headed towards that narrative .
It ’s a very specific kind of improv – it ’s narrative driven improv and I think that makes the difference .
PH : Obviously , this is not a story where you have heroes or villains , but your character does kind of do the most questionable things of any of the characters .
MD : Yeah , I agree .
PH : He seems very comfortable taking some big chances with his relationships .
How do you think about him , for example , in the scene where he stays several hours at the party , though he has told Anna he ’d shortly be leaving for home and her special pork chops .
What ’s kind of going through your head about what he ’s thinking about ?
MD : His behavior is understandable to me because he’s at a bit of a crisis point when he sees Andrew .
He ’s in his early thirties and his life is fine and it ’s great .
But when he sees he remembers the person he was when he was 19 , in college with Andrew , and their whole life was ahead of them and their dreams were at their fingertips .
It makes him realize that he has not achieved that he would have hoped he ’d achieve ; he did n’t become exactly who he hoped he ’d become , and that makes him want to take all the little elements of his life , throw them in a box , shake it upside down , dump it on the floor and see what happens .
He wants to shake things up and see what kind of foundation they really have .
I think this whole idea of doing this porn with Andrew is right in line with that .
PH : That ’s funny .
It ’s pretty much in line with exactly what I was thinking .
He almost had to be not really sure whether he wanted to keep going on the path he thought he wanted to go on .
MD : Absolutely .
PH : Now , I ’ve got a very superficial question for you , and I guess we ’ll wrap up with this one .
I was watching “ This Is John ” [ a very funny 2003 short subject by the Duplass Brothers ] last night .
You look younger now – and very different at times .
In some of the shots I thought maybe your brother was subbing for you or something .
You really look different now and I can’t figure out why .
You have any ideas ?
MD : I do n’t know , except when we made “ This is John , ” we combed my hair in a very special way and put on the computer guy ’s outfit that was our roommate at the time .
That might have had a specific part in it , but , who knows , maybe I found the fountain of youth .
PH : I was thinking maybe you had a nose job but then I looked again and I said , “ no , the nose looks the same . ”
MD : I have n’t had any work done , if that ’s what you mean .
I do n’t plan on doing that anytime soon .
PH : [ Laughing ]
I was just comparing pictures and I could n’t support that theory .
Since we ’ve got another second here , I ’ll ask you another question about that film .
You were playing your roommate ?
MD : That was a pretty quick movie – from conception to when it was done shooting was a half hour .
We shot one 20 minute take and then it was done .
I dressed up like my friend , Will .
Put his clothes on , combed my hair like him and just imagined what it would like to be a frustrated computer programmer trying to the outgoing greeting on his answering machine .
And that ’s what came out .
It happened very quickly .
Cut it down to eight minutes and that was our first movie that got into Sundance .
That ’s how life is …a $ 3 movie .

Special Operations Chiefs Quietly Sway Afghanistan Policy
Created : November 09 , 2009 19:22 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Vice Admirals William McRaven and Robert Harward ( navy.mil )
Two senior military officers from the shadowy world of Special Operations are playing a large and previously unreported role in shaping the Obama administration ’s Afghanistan and Pakistan strategy , a move that underscores that the internal debate has moved past a rigid choice between expansive missions to provide security for Afghan civilians and narrowly tailored missions to find and kill terrorists .
[ Security 1 ] Navy Vice Adm. William H. McRaven , the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) at Ft. Bragg , N.C. , and Vice Adm. Robert S. Harward , the deputy leader of the Joint Forces Command in Norfolk , Va. , are attending and informing the strategy meetings that the White House began in September to refine its approach in Afghanistan .
Both men have deep ties to Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in the war .
They are said to favor large infusions of U.S. troops to Afghanistan for performing counterinsurgency operations in select population centers , but they also advocate marshalling forces to pursue terrorists across Afghanistan ’s rugged , mountainous terrain — a task in which McRaven plays a key role .
Debate about a “ purely counterterrorism strategy ” advocated by Vice President Joseph Biden was “ bounced around at one point , but that has been cast aside , ” said a National Security Council staffer who attends the meetings and who asked for anonymity because the debate is still ongoing , “ mostly because JSOC has said ‘ We ’re going to do this anyway . ’
And it ’s not like they ’re going to be in a supporting role . ”
Biden ’s advice , which had practically no support from the armed services , was that the military should shy away from protecting the Afghan people and helping build Afghan governing institutions , and instead focus on the JSOC specialties of going after terrorists directly .
Yet the fact that JSOC veterans like McRaven , Harward and McChrystal favor an overall counterinsurgency strategy with a counterterrorism component demonstrates that the military no longer believes distinguishing between the two is tenable in the Afghanistan war .
“ Special Operations Forces that were traditionally used for counterterrorism better understand how their capabilities fit into a counterinsurgency campaign than perhaps they did when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began , ” said Andrew Exum , a veteran of both wars and a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who over the summer advised McChrystal in a review of Afghanistan strategy .
More directly , McRaven and Harward share a professional fraternity with McChrystal .
Before McRaven took over JSOC — an entity that operates almost entirely in secret — McChrystal ran it for five years , supervising stealthy teams in Afghanistan and Iraq that tracked down and killed senior terrorists like al - Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
One of McChrystal ’s deputies during that period was Harward , and the bonds between the officers remain strong .
“ General McChrystal and Vice Admirals McRaven and Harward have established relationships through the special operations community , ” said McChrystal ’s spokesman , Air Force Lt. Col .
Tadd Sholtis .
In his Afghanistan review , McChrystal said that a key goal for him would be to increase coordination between his NATO command and the independent command of JSOC , which suggested that the dichotomy between using Special Operations Forces for counterterrorism and conventional forces for counterinsurgency was eroding .
“ One of General McChrystal ’s priorities is seeking greater unity of effort across all military activities in Afghanistan , which includes regular interaction with ISAF Joint Command , regional , and task force commanders , ” Sholtis said , using the acronym for NATO ’s military command in Afghanistan .
As a result , McChrystal is turning to McRaven and Harward for critical tasks in Afghanistan .
McRaven runs a secretive detachment of Special Forces known as Task Force 714 — once commanded by McChrystal himself — that the NSC staffer described as “ direct- action ” units conducting “ high - intensity hits . ”
In an email , Sholtis said that because Task Force 714 was a “ special ops organization ” he “ ca n’t go into much detail on authorities , etc . ”
But the NSC staffer — who called McRaven “ McChrystal Squared ” — said Task Force 714 was organized into “ small groups of Rangers going wherever the hell they want to go ” in Afghanistan and operating under legal authority granted at the end of the Bush administration that President Obama has not revoked .
In a move signaling his own importance to McChrystal , Harward will arrive in Afghanistan later this month to command a new task force , known as Task Force 435 , that will take charge of detention facilities in Afghanistan , “ primarily the new one at Bagram that will open this month , ” Sholtis said .
In his famous August strategy review , McChrystal wrote that detention operations are “ critical to successful counterinsurgency operations ” and need to work toward “ the long - term goal of getting the U.S. out of the detention business ” through transition to Afghan control — a counterinsurgency task not traditionally given to a Special Operations veteran like Harward .
McChrystal ’s strategy recommended creating a new command , which Harward will now lead , of “ approximately 120 personnel ” focused on “ defeat[ing ] the insurgency through intelligence collection and analysis , ” prisoner de-radicalization , and working with the Afghan corrections apparatus to “ employ best correctional practices [ and ] comply with Afghan laws . ”
Last month , McChrystal delivered a request for additional troops to the Obama administration for the Afghanistan war .
The request , structured as a palette of options from which the president could choose , included so - called “ high - risk ” options of numbers as low as 10,000 new combat troops and a so - called “ low - risk ” option of an 85,000 - troop reinforcement .
Participants in the discussions have said on background that they viewed the 85,000 - troop request as an unserious option meant to clear the way for Obama to approve a middle course of around 40,000 new troops .
But while the media has typically discussed a counterterrorism approach in Afghanistan as a low - troop option , the two counterterrorism - experienced admirals are both said to favor “ as many troops as we can muster , ” according to the NSC staffer , who specified that McRaven and Harward were pushing for McChrystal ’s largest resource option of 85,000 new troops .
A senior administration official who requested anonymity said that the Obama administration was not considering a troop escalation of more than 40,000 combat troops .
( It is possible that support and logistical units could increase any troop number that the administration cites as the total estimate , as happened when President Bush announced a troop surge to Iraq of about 20,000 troops in January 2007 but about 28,000 new troops actually deployed . )
On Saturday , McClatchy Newspapers reported that Obama is leaning toward an increase of 34,000 troops .
An announcement is expected shortly after Obama returns from a trip to Asia on Nov. 20 .
The advice of McRaven and Harward to the White House strategy review , the staffer said , was to push for a “ heavy , heavy , heavy COIN [ counterinsurgency ] presence ” in select population centers like the capitol city of Kabul , while relying on new or expanded counterterrorism units like Task Force 714 for hunting and killing terrorists outside of those population centers — particularly in areas like the porous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan , a key transit point for Taliban and al - Qaeda - affiliated insurgents .
“ They ’re focusing on the main population centers that they think they can save with manpower on the ground , and everything else will be crossborder , ” the NSC staffer said .
An executive order signed by George W. Bush in mid-2008 and not revoked by Obama authorized special forces to , in some cases , cross the Afghan border into Pakistan in pursuit of top insurgent targets .
“ JSOC is already ramping up for that .
…
These are what they call kinetic , direct - action task forces , ” military terminology to describe intense fighting with small units .
The prospect of crossborder raids by U.S. military forces has been greeted in Pakistan as an offensive violation of Pakistani sovereignty .
The two admirals are also said to be influential with Jim Jones , Obama ’s national security adviser .
McRaven , at least , worked with Jones in a previous assignment , commanding Special Operations Forces in Europe in 2006 while Jones was ending his tour of duty as NATO commander .
“ A lot of people think Jones is not taking military counsel , that he ’s anti-surge , he ’s this , he ’s that , ” said the NSC staffer .
“ In reality , he ’s taking counsel from pretty much a purely military palette of people , including McRaven . ”
Asked about McRaven ’s role in the strategy debates , Ken McGraw , a spokesman for the U.S. Special Operations Command , which oversees JSOC , said , “ It would not be appropriate for us to comment on who may or may not be involved in discussions at the White House or what may or may not have been the substance of conversations at the White House . ”
A spokesman for the Joint Forces Command did not return repeated phone and email messages seeking comment about Harward .
A spokesman for the National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment about Jones ’ interactions with Harward and McRaven .
The bonds between McChrystal and the two admirals may not have been widely known because of the secrecy surrounding almost all aspects of JSOC , but the Obama administration is getting a sense of their strength .
“ Harward and McChrystal were running JSOC , ” said the NSC staffer , “ and all three of them [ have been ] in the nether regions forever . ”
On Tuesday evening , December 8th , thousands of physicists around the world cheered as CERN's Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) smashed together subatomic particles at the highest energies ever reached by a human - made accelerator and the giant ATLAS detector observed the products of the record - breaking reactions whizzing through its sophisticated tracking devices .
Some of the loudest cheers were from Canadians who helped design , build , and commission LHC and ATLAS which are launching a new era of discovery about how the universe works .
" This is the breakthrough moment we have all been waiting for , " said Rob McPherson , spokesperson and Principal Investigator for the 150 person Canadian team , professor at the University of Victoria , and Institute of Particle Physics Research Scientist .
" The LHC was conceived of more than two decades ago , and today 's success represents the start of a new era in our understanding of matter and the universe . "
The new world record is set by the collisions of more than 10 billion protons per bunch at a total energy of 2.36 trillion electron volts , or TeV , per collision .
The Large Hadron Collider accelerates two counter - rotating beams of protons to nearly the speed of light and then brings them into collision inside giant , cathedral - sized detectors that study the subatomic debris that comes flying outward .
The Canadian team plays a leading role in the ATLAS detector , akin to a gigantic digital camera that examines the millions of collisions per second and identifies which ones should be stored and analyzed in more detail .
The project goals are just as awe - inspiring : probe the structure of space to search for extra dimensions , identify and study why matter has mass in the universe , and even explore theories that connect subatomic particles to the cosmos through dark matter and dark energy .
" This is it , " said Nigel S. Lockyer , director of TRIUMF , Canada 's national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics that led Canadian involvement in the project .
" We are the edge of what we know and are boldly stepping forward : we are now doing physics that has never been done before !
It 's amazing ... and I 'm glad Canada has a piece of the action . "
TRIUMF worked with universities and companies across Canada to contribute key elements of the Large Hadron Collider accelerator itself as well as the ATLAS detector .
TRIUMF is also home to one of the ten supercomputer ( so called Tier - 1 ) data centres around the world that processes the enormous volumes of data from the ATLAS experiment and distributes it to the thousands of scientists involved .
In fact , today 's collisions " showed up " in the Canadian computer centre within hours , ready for Canadian scientists to start analyzing them .
These developments come just three weeks after the LHC restart , demonstrating the excellent performance of the machine .
First low - energy beams were injected into the LHC on Friday 20 November .
On Monday 23 November , two low - energy beams circulated together for the first time , and the four giant LHC detectors recorded their first collision data .
Next steps are to increase the energy and number of collisions over the next months as physicists scour the data for signs of the Higgs Boson , supersymmetry , new dimensions in space , and whatever other secrets nature has in store .

Likely adding fuel to Palestinian claims that the Israeli government ’s promise of a 10 - month settlement construction freeze does n’t amount to anything of the sort , Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has approved new construction in the West Bank .
Incredibly enough , the approvals come at the exact same time as Barak issued the “ temporary freeze order , ” which was being presented as halting new construction in the West Bank but actually only restricts permits of certain types of buildings for 10 months .
28 buildings are said to be included in the new construction .
Adding insult to injury , the Israeli government is also pressing the nation ’s Supreme Court to allow it to delay the ordered destruction of illegal outposts – settlements which even the Israeli government concedes are not legal .
Israel has been contending with a growing mutiny among its more religious soldiers , some of whom are reportedly being told that they have to refuse the outpost evacuations on religious grounds .
Still , the official reason for the delay request is the 10 month freeze , which it seems is making settlement construction less frozen than ever .
The Demonstration produces a chart and a graphic .
The chart shows ( 1 ) the annual premium assistance amount the taxpayers will receive in the form of a refundable credit off their federal income taxes ( the subsidy ) ; ( 2 ) the amount of the premium that will still be paid by the taxpayer ; ( 3 ) the annual premium ; and ( 4 ) the effect of the premium subsidy on the effective marginal tax rate on income .
A value of 0.091 with respect to this last item means that the premium subsidies effectively increase the marginal rate of income taxation by 9.1 % .
The graphic shows how the amount of the subsidy varies as a function of income .
Health care reform bills pending in the United States Congress in 2009 generally penalize individuals in some fashion for failing to acquire health insurance coverage but subsidize individuals who purchase insurance if their income is within certain bounds .
This Demonstration explores the extent of the premium subsidy provided under the two leading reform contenders , HR 3590 , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Senate ) , and HR 3962 , the Affordable Health Care for America Act ( House of Representatives ) .
These bills generally make the amount of the subsidy a function of one 's income relative to the " federal poverty level " .
You select where the person lives as well as the size of the family .
These selections determine the applicable federal poverty level .
You then set the family 's income using either a direct method or one in which income is a multiple of the applicable federal poverty level .
You also determine the annual amount the law uses as a basis for computing the subsidy .
This amount will reflect conditions in the post - reform health insurance market .
Details
Although they arrive there by different routes , the bills define income in an essentially similar way .
HR 3590 relies on the concept of " household income " , which is defined in section 1501 ( b ) of the bill as essentially the sum of the " modified adjusted gross incomes " of the beneficiaries of the insurance policy .
HR 3962 relies directly on the concept of " modified adjusted gross income " but then in section 342 ( a ) ( 2 ) specifies that members of a family be lumped together for purposes of computing the premium credit .
The provisions underlying this Demonstration may be found in section 1401 of HR 3590 and section 343 of HR 3962 .
Both of these provisions insert section 36B into the Internal Revenue Code .
The federal poverty level is calculated using data contained in the Federal Register and may be found online at http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/09fedreg.shtml
This Demonstration does not compute subsidies for " out - of - pocket " expenses that are provided by section 344 of HR 3590 and section 1402 of the Act .
These subsidies further increase the effective marginal tax rate on income created by health care reform .
At the time of writing , it 's not clear whether the 2009 Christmas No 1 will be The Climb by Joe McElderry , or Killing in the Name by Rage Against the Machine .
I 've just done my bit to inch the latter closer to the top spot by downloading it – something I 'd resisted doing until now because I initially thought there was something a bit embarrassing about the campaign .
After all , as every other internet smartarse pointed out , both tracks are owned by Sony BMG – so no matter which one sells the most , Simon Cowell wins .
In other words , even by raging against the machine , you 're somehow raging within it .
But profit is n't the point – or at least it 's not the reason I downloaded it .
For one thing , I happen to think Killing in the Name is an excellent song , so I 've already got something out of it .
Most importantly , it contains genuine emotion .
Even if the climactic repeated howls of " Fuck you , I wo n't do what you tell me ! " put you in mind of a teenager loudly refusing to tidy his bedroom – as opposed to a masked anarchist hurling petrol bombs at the riot squad – there is at least an authentic human sentiment being expressed .
Zack de la Rocha is audibly pissed off .
Compare this to the pissweak vocal doodle that is Joe McElderry 's X Factor single .
For a song whose lyrics ostensibly document an attempt to gather the spiritual strength to overcome adversity and thereby attain enlightenment , The Climb is about as inspiring as a Lion bar .
It 's a listless announcement on a service station Tannoy ; an advert for buttons ; a fart in a clinic ; a dot on a spreadsheet .
Listening to it from beginning to end is like watching a bored cleaner methodically wiping a smudge from a Formica worksurface .
But then nobody 's buying The Climb in order to actually listen to it .
They 're buying it out of sedated confusion , pushing a button they 've been told will make them feel better .
It 's the sound of the assisted suicide clinic , and it does n't deserve to be No 1 this Christmas .
This is n't mere pop snobbery , by the way .
I 'd rather see Girls Aloud at No 1 than Editors .
But The Climb is a lame cover version of a lame Miley Cyrus song .
If X Factor can't be arsed to do better than that , its grip on the yuletide charts deserves to be broken .
Anyway , while I 'm happy for Rage Against the Machine to be enjoying the sales and publicity , I can't help thinking we could 've organised a slightly better protest ourselves .
Chances are the X Factor will try to kick back extra hard next year – perhaps by actually releasing a song with a melody in it – so it 's best to start planning the resistance now .
The temptation might be to pour a lot of time and effort into creating a catchy anti-X Factor anthem , but the smartest counter - move would be to release something short , cheap and throwaway that is n't even a proper song at all .
I propose a track called Simon Cowell : Shit for Ears , which consists of a couple of eight - year - olds droning the phrase " Simon Cowell , shit for ears " four times in a row in the most deliberately tuneless manner possible .
It should last only about 15 seconds or so .
Quick enough to register ; brief enough not to outstay its welcome .
Then we release it online at the lowest price possible .
What 's the bare minimum you can charge and still be eligible for a chart position ?
It could be as little as 2 p .
Because the track is just recorded on to a cheap mic , and released without the assistance of any record label , 100 % of the profits go to charity .
Dot -eyed CGI judge and omnipresent hair product spokeswoman Cheryl Cole recently complained that the campaign against McElderry 's single was " mean " , adding " If that song – or should I say campaign – by an American group is our Christmas No 1 , I 'll be gutted for him and our charts . "
She 's missing the point .
It 's not mean : it 's funny .
If the Christmas No 1 turns out to be an angry , confrontational rock track that concludes with an explosion of f- words , it 'll be precisely the shot in the arm the charts have been sorely lacking the last few years : something that puts a genuine smile on the face of millions of people ; sensitive people , thoughtful people ; people alienated by the stifling cloud of grinning mechanical pap farted into their faces on a weekly basis by cocky , clattering , calculating talent shows such as X Factor .
It would give these people hope .
Maybe only in a very small and silly way , but still : a tiny spoonful of hope .
And what could be more Christmassy than that ?
London , England ( CNN ) -- Rage Against the Machine has claimed the prestigious No. 1 spot on the British singles chart on the last Sunday before Christmas , marking the first time in five years the winner of Simon Cowell 's " X - Factor " has not won .
Joe McElderry 's " The Climb " came in second , beaten by a huge online swell of support for " Killing in the Name , " backed by a Facebook group with nearly 1 million members .
It was the first time a group had ever won the top slot based on downloads alone , BBC's " The Chart Show " said .
Tracy Morter , one of the founders of the Facebook group backing Rage , said her response was " shock , really . "
" You do n't actually think it 's going to happen , and we just want to make sure Joe knows it was n't personal against him and hope he has a wonderful Christmas , " she said .
The Facebook group also raised about 63,000 pounds ( $ 101,829 ) for the homeless charity Shelter , she said .
The group had " nearly a million people -- we 're 3,000 off a million , " she said .
The group vowed to download " Killing in the Name " starting earlier this month to make it the No. 1 single in the country on the Sunday before Christmas .
It might seem like a frivolous contest , but hundreds of thousands of pounds -- and a place in history -- are at stake .
A Christmas No. 1 enters the history books , exciting passion , disgust , joy and , yes , rage .
The Corbett Report has released a new video message to the environmental movement .
Watch the video by clicking here or in the embedded player .
Transcript : This is James Corbett of corbettreport.com and I come here today with a message for you .
You the environmentalists , you the activists , you the campaigners .
You who have watched with growing concern the ways in which the world around us has been ravaged in the pursuit of the almighty dollar .
You who are concerned with the state of the planet that we are leaving for our children and our grandchildren and those generations yet unborn .
This is not a message of divisiveness , but cooperation .
This is a message of hope and empowerment , but it requires us to look at a hard and uncomfortable truth :
Your movement has been usurped by the very same financial interests you thought you were fighting against .
You have suspected as much for years .
You watched at first with hope and excitement as your movement , your cause , your message began to spread , as it was taken up by the media and given attention , as conferences were organized and as the ideas you had struggled so long and hard to be heard were talked about nationally .
Then internationally .
You watched with growing unease as the message was simplified .
First it became a slogan .
Then it became a brand .
Soon it was nothing more than a label and it became attached to products .
The ideas you had once fought for were now being sold back to you .
For profit .
You watched with growing unease as the message became parroted , not argued , worn like a fashion rather than something that came from the conviction of understanding .
You disagreed when the slogans -- and then the science -- were dumbed down .
When carbon dioxide became the focus and CO2 was taken up as a political cause .
Soon it was the only cause .
You knew that Al Gore was not a scientist , that his evidence was factually incorrect , that the movement was being taken over by a cause that was not your own , one that relied on beliefs you did not share to propose a solution you did not want .
It began to reach a breaking point when you saw that the solutions being proposed were not solutions at all , when they began to propose new taxes and new markets that would only serve to line their own pockets .
You knew something was wrong when you saw them argue for a cap - and - trade scheme proposed by Ken Lay , when you saw Goldman Sachs position itself to ride the carbon trading bubble , when the whole thrust of the movement became ways to make money or spend money or raise money from this panic .
Your movement had been hijacked .
The realization came the first time you read The Club of Rome 's 1991 book , The First Global Revolution , which says :
" In searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like , would fit the bill .
In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together .
But in designating these dangers as the enemy , we fall into the trap , which we have already warned readers about , namely mistaking symptoms for causes .
All these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes , and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome .
The real enemy then is humanity itself . "
And when you looked at the Club of Rome 's elite member roster .
And when you learnt about eugenics and the Rockefeller ties to the Kaiser Willhelm Institute and the practice of crypto-eugenics and the rise of overpopulation fearmongering and the call by elitist after elitist after elitist to cull the world population .
Still , you wanted to believe that there was some basis of truth , something real and valuable in the single - minded obsession of this hijacked environmental movement with manmade global warming .
Now , in November 2009 , the last traces of doubt have been removed .
Last week , an insider leaked internal documents and emails from the Climate Research Unit of East Anglia University and exposed the lies , manipulation and fraud behind the studies that supposedly show 0.6 degrees Celsius of warming over the last 130 years .
And the hockey stick graph that supposedly shows unprecedented warming in our times .
And the alarmist warning of impending climate disaster .
We now know that these scientists wrote programming notes in the source code of their own climate models admitting that results were being manually adjusted .
We now know that values were being adjusted to conform to scientists ' wishes , not reality .
We now know that the peer review process itself was being perverted to exclude those scientists whose work criticized their findings .
We now know that these scientists privately expressed doubts about the science that they publicly claimed to be settled .
We now know , in short , that they were lying .
It is unknown as yet what the fallout will be from all of this , but it is evident that the fallout will be substantial .
With this crisis , however , comes an opportunity .
An opportunity to recapture the movement that the financiers have stolen from the people .
Together , we can demand a full and independent investigation into all of the researchers whose work was implicated in the CRU affair .
We can demand a full re-evaluation of all those studies whose conclusions have been thrown into question by these revelations , and all of the public policy that has been based on those studies .
We can establish new standards of transparency for scientists whose work is taxpayer funded and / or whose work effects public policy , so that everyone has full and equal access to the data used to calculate results and all of the source code used in all of the programs used to model that data .
In other words , we can reaffirm that no cause is worth supporting that requires deception for its propagation .
Even more importantly , we can take back the environmental movement .
We can begin to concentrate on the serious questions that need to be asked about the genetic engineering technology whereby hybrid organisms and new , never - before - seen proteins that are being released into the biosphere in a giant , uncontrolled experiment that threatens the very genome of life on this planet .
We can look into the environmental causes of the explosion in cancer and the staggering drops in fertility over the last 50 years , including the BPA in our plastics and the anti-androgens in the water .
We can examine regulatory agencies that are controlled by the very corporations they are supposedly watching over .
We can begin focusing on depleted uranium and the dumping of toxic waste into the rivers and all of the issues that we once knew were part of the mandate of the real environmental movement .
Or we can , as some have , descend into petty partisan politics .
We can decide that lies are OK if they support ' our ' side .
We can defend the reprehensible actions of the CRU researchers and rally around the green flag that has long since been captured by the enemy .
It is a simple decision to make , but one that we must make quickly , before the argument can be spun away and environmentalism can go back to business as usual .
We are at a crossroads of history .
And make no mistake , history will be the final judge of our actions .
So I leave you today with a simple question :
Which side of history do you want to be on ?

A giant reconstructed
The giant deer , also known as the giant Irish deer or Irish elk , is one of the largest deer species that ever lived .
Yet why this giant animal , which had massive antlers spanning 3.6 m , suddenly became extinct some 10,600 years ago has remained a mystery .
Now a study of its teeth is producing tantalising answers , suggesting the deer could n't cope with climate change .
As conditions became colder and drier in Ireland at the time , fewer plants grew , gradually starving the deer .
The discovery is published in the journal Palaeogeography , Palaeoclimatology , Palaeoecology .
The giant deer ( Megaloceros giganteus ) has become famous over the past few centuries .
In the early 1800s , discoveries of its remains opened up the debate about whether animal species had previously become extinct , and whether new life - forms could be discovered in the fossil record .
It would be very difficult for young deer to cope with all these changes brought on by the Ice Age
Researcher Ms Kendra Chritz Around this time , conflicting ideas as to why the animal went extinct began to emerge .
Initial ideas ranged from the Biblical flood described by Genesis , to the idea that humans had wiped them out .
However , the archaeological record suggests that people did not arrive in Ireland until after the last Ice Age , after most giant deer had disappeared .
There is also little evidence that the deer had any predators in Ireland .
A popular idea that also emerged was that the deer 's huge antlers , spanning up to 3.6 m , grew disproportionately large due to sexual selection .
Females became attracted to and mated with males with ever larger antlers , according to the idea , and eventually the antlers became so unwieldy that the deer became mired in clay soils , where they perished .
Artist 's impression " Yet this is too simplistic an answer for why such a massive population of apparently thriving organisms could go extinct suddenly , " says Ms Kendra Chritz , who conducted the study at the University College ( UCD ) , Dublin , Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland while studying for an undergraduate degree at the University of Portland , in Oregon , US .
Supervised by Dr Julia Sigwart of Queen 's University , Belfast and Dr Gareth Dyke of UCD , Ms Chritz and colleagues analysed the tooth enamel of seven fossilised male giant deer .
By studying levels of carbon and oxygen isotopes , and levels of cementum , a material that cements each tooth crown to the gums , the researchers could uncover the time of year each deer was born , their diet and how their lives and behaviour may have changed each year .
Stressed out
The ratios of isotopes revealed that the ecosystem in which the deer lived became stressed by drought .
As a result it changed from being covered in forest to being more open and tundra - like .
" There 's an overall trend of general vegetation decline , " says Ms Chritz .
The deer also appeared to be born in spring or early summer .
But at the time of their extinction , temperatures dropped .
Big beast " Giant deer would probably have had a hard time coping with cooler mean annual temperature and a shortened growing season , " says Ms Chritz .
That would be particularly bad news for young deer .
Most young animals are born in spring precisely because temperatures are warmer and there is more food available .
" It would be very difficult for young deer to cope with all these changes brought on by the Ice Age , as well as support the energetic demands of their growing bodies , " concludes Ms Chritz , who is now studying for her PhD in palaeoecology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City , US .
Data from the cementum , which grows each year much like tree rings , indicates that the deer lived from 6.5 to 14 years old , and they possessed mature antlers by autumn , similar to other living deer species .
Last refuge
Though often called the Irish elk , Megaloceros giganteus is actually a deer species .
Though most abundant in Ireland , it was not confined to the island , with populations living across Europe and Western Asia from 400,000 to 10,600 years ago .
The last Ice Age stretched from 100,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago , containing periods of greater and lesser glaciation .
The deer rapidly disappeared across most of the range at the end of the last glacial transition , though giant deer remains have been uncovered in Siberia that date to around 7,000 years before present .
" That means that mainland giant deer had some sort of refugia from the Ice Age before they met their ultimate extinction ; they were able to move to a better environment and survive later , " says Ms Chritz .
But those giant deer in Ireland " had the misfortune to be trapped on an island with nowhere to go . "

“ Talk of an exit strategy is exactly the wrong way to go , ” Senator Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday .
The Senate ’s second - most powerful Republican wants President Barack Obama to defer to the generals ’ wishes in Afghanistan without announcing a strategy to end the war .
On Tuesday December 1 , Obama will deliver a major Afghanistan speech at West Point , nine days before picking up his Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo , Norway .

“ As I understand it we ’re going to go with 30 to 35 thousand American troops , ” Senator Evan Bayh ( D - IN ) said on the program .
“ We ’re going to try and make up the difference with NATO .
They ’re probably not as good and effective as American troops but I think its good that we have some burden - sharing .
After all , the American taxpayers should n’t have to pay for this whole thing if our allies are wiling to step up and do their part . ”
British PM Gordon Brown said Saturday that countries backing Afghanistan ’s government are going to demand that it meet specific security benchmarks , outlining a plan to let foreign troops gradually hand control to local forces .
Brown is expected to announce plans to send 500 more British troops next week .
The U.S. has approximately 68,000 troops in Afghanistan .
NATO members have approximately 55,000 troops there .
According to reporter Jeremy Scahill there are even more U.S. contractors ( armed and unarmed combined ) in Afghanistan than U.S. troops .
According to the Washington Post , as many as 9,000 U.S. Marines will move into the country next as part of Obama ’s escalation of the eight - year - old war .
They will double the size of the U.S. force in the southern province of Helmand and will provide a critical test for disputed Afghan President Hamid Karzai ’s struggling government and fraying Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal ’s counterinsurgency strategy .
Bayh and Kyl stuck to the talking points for the most part on Sunday morning , but Kyl brought up Vietnam and Bayh mentioned the cost of the war , suggesting there will be criticism from all sides immediately following Obama ’s speech .
Just one day earlier , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) told Fox News , “ This war is undermining our nation . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ 35,000 new troops ?
That ’s going to cost $ 35 billion more a year , ” he said .
“ Where are we going to find that money ?
Who ’s going to finance this ?
You ’re going to tell the taxpayers we ’re going to borrow more money from China so we can fight a war in Afghanistan ?
Come on ! ”
Obama ’s speech is expected to put his alliance with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) to the test as well .
House members may introduce a Resolution of Disapproval to counter Obama ’s plan .
Pelosi and the President met privately last week as Obama concluded his deliberations on Afghanistan , according to The Hill .

Debunking the climate change Denierism nonsense that George Will writes is more akin to clubbing plush toys than an actual intellectual exercise .
Shooting fish in a barrel ?
sure , if we ’re talking about the barrel of the gun in question ; easy and pointless .
George
Will knows perfectly well that he is publishing nonsense about climate science , and he is going to keep right on doing it because he is paid precisely because he writes nonsense , not despite it .
The question is , what are we going to do about it ?
Last winter
Will stunned us when his pre-existing condition of climate change Denierism plunged to new lows .
However , like the arctic sea ice minimums , it seems to have been merely a sign of an on - going precipitous decline .
For example , in July he repeated the “ Global Cooling Fable “ , got called on it ( again ) , repeats it again in late September , and is corrected again .
Since then we have had Seth Borenstein ’s widely publicized “ Independent statisticians reject ‘ global cooling ’ fable ” accompanied by all of the other evidence that this Fable is idiotic nonsense .
Will ’s reaction ?
he merely repeats the lie again on November 7th .
In fact this most recent example is so bad that James Hrynyshyn writes :
“ In an otherwise typically error - dominated Newsweek column , George F. Will spelled “ minuscule ” correctly .
So I do n’t want to read any complaints that Will gets everything wrong each time he writes about climate change . “
Another example , in addition to many other errors and fabrications in “ Bad climate for global worriers “ , Will repeats the “ ice age scare in the 70s ” meme ( debunked ) and the “ climate science as religion ” stupidity .
His source for these clots of ignorance ?
Superfreakonomics .
The date of this assault on credulity ?
November 8 , well after Superfreakonomics had been widely exposed as idiotic drivel .
Yet his column contains not even a whiff that there may be some reason to be skeptical of the book ’s so - called “ facts ” , much less the acknowledgement that climate scientists are divided as to whether the book is simply bad fiction or outright delusional .
[ aside , lovely Superfreaks bon mot here ]
There are undoubtedly many more examples , but I think the pattern is clear enough .
Let ’s be honest here , a lobotomized hamster set loose on a key board would get the climate change facts right more often than George Will does .
This is not a matter of accident , ignorance , or a failure in fact checking ; this is a deliberate misleading of the public .
Has Will learned nothing ?
Yes he has , he has learned he can lie with abandon and by and large he will be thanked for it .
The Washington Post etc are not employing Will despite his nonsense , but rather for it .
They want a propagandist , not an columnist .
The only way for Will to get in trouble at the Post is if he started reporting on climate issues accurately and intelligently .
Which is not to suggest that Will is a reluctant pawn of the powers that be .
Like every good Apparatchik I have no doubt he does his work with sincere dedication to the Washington Post ‘s Columnist Manifesto .
The thing is , Will may be an ugly pustule of climate ignorance , but the real problem is the underlying intellectual putrification that infects the editorial and management decisions of the Washington Post and similar popular media .
Even if we managed to lance Will , the pus will continue to ooze from the Post .
Will is the sock puppet , not the puppeteer .
To a great extent the climate change science blogosphere operates on the implicit assumption that education is answer , if only we could get the facts out there .
Trouble is , we do get the facts out there ( not that they were difficult to find in the first place ) and it is not winning the day .
As Pierrehumbert ’s brilliant open letter to Steve Levitt documents , many people would rather travel across the continent to be misled rather than walk two blocks to get the facts .
In a nutshell , the vested interests are only too happy to employ willing propagandists to write nonsense for a public , many of whom are only too eager to believe the fiction as it does not threaten their life style .
The problem is not simply a matter of more or better education , but rather economic and social in nature , ie political .
The solution is necessarily economic and social , ie political .
Which is not to say that on - going education via correcting Will ’s and other Denier ’s nonsense is n’t valuable .
It is necessary , merely insufficient .
What more will be necessary ?
Boycotts ?
pressure campaigns ?
other ?
Probably all of the above and more .
The relevant media will continue to spew their misinfotainment for as long as it is to their economic advantage to do so .
While I believe that this is implicitly understood throughout the climate change science blogosphere it is only rarely explicitly stated .
Further , as far as I know , it is not discussed insofar as how the science blogosphere adjusts to continue it ’s vital educational role while being relevant to the new reality .
Make no mistake , our role has changed , the question is how well we fulfill it .
James Hansen has embraced it , or is at least exploring what that may mean .
What does it mean for the rest of us ?
what do we need to do differently ?
and how do we make that happen ?
And as for the Bozo the Clown ’s egregious stupidity – smack him down as needed , but do n’t imagine it will change anything .

It is one thing for an artist to credit his career choice to an unhappy youth in which opportunities for self - expression were perpetually stifled , and quite another for an artist to say that his parents literally took his voice from him .
That , however , is the story of David Small ’s life as he tells it in “ Stitches , ” a graphic memoir , which comes out this week .
Roughly a half century ago , when Mr. Small was 14 , he underwent an operation his parents told him was to remove a cyst in his neck but which he discovered by chance had been throat cancer .
The surgery left him without one of his vocal cords or his thyroid gland .
And , for nearly a decade , he could n’t speak above a hoarse whisper .
The matter of young David ’s cancer was not discussed in the Smalls ’ Detroit house except for a brief occasion a year after the operation .
His father , an aloof and withholding radiologist , attempted to unburden himself of the knowledge that the extensive radiation treatments he had performed on his son had caused the cancer .
“ In those days we gave any kid born with breathing difficulty X - rays , ” his father confesses in the book .
“ Two to four hundred rads .
I gave you cancer . ”
For a while after the operation , Mr. Small said recently , “ I took it as a punishment  sort of this ‘ We ’ve been telling you to shut up for years , now we ’re finally making you shut up . ’ ”
Meleanie Hain – the Pennsylvania woman who made national headlines when she took a loaded gun to her 5 - year old daughter 's soccer game – was found shot dead , along with her husband in the couple 's Lebanon home Wednesday night .
The couple 's three children were inside the home at the time , and neighbors told WGAL.com the kids ran out of the house screaming .
" The little boy said , ' Daddy shot mommy , ' " said Aileen Fortna .
Another neighbor told the Delco Times that Meleanie , 31 , and her husband , Scott , 33 , were having marital problems .
Her gun-toting problems started about a year ago when Meleanie picked an ominous day – September 11 , 2008 – to show up at her little girl 's soccer game with the loaded gun holstered to her hip , very visible and very upsetting to other parents .
Her permit was revoked a few days later , but Hain won a court battle to get it back .
The judge who ruled in her favor admonished her at the time , saying she'd " scared the devil " out of other people that day .
Hain then turned around and sued the sheriff who originally took her gun away .
She was asking for one million dollars , claiming her constitutional rights were violated , her babysitting business suffered , her children were harassed and she 'd been shunned by neighbors .
" She has been stigmatized unfairly , " her attorney , Matthew Weisberg said at the time .
Back in December , Hain was runner - up for The Patriot - News " Person of the Year " .
Despite all the controversy , she said her views on the right to bear arms had n't changed .
" I am happy being a gun owner . "
Autopsies were being performed Thursday .
The Hain children were with relatives .

It is the fool that spends his hour perplexing ,
The nature of unexpected vexing ,
It is the fool that thinks it is mere chance ,
When he finds himself in great happenstance ,
We each are linked to an unknown brother ,
What befalls one , will befall the other ,
Their fates together eternally swirled ,
Fighting to control each parallel world .
Introduction
Tandem StarCraft is UMS map inspired by the game " Tandem Chess . "
In Tandem StarCraft , two separate one versus one games are played , and the objective is the same as in normal melee StarCraft .
The catch is that if you destroy one of your enemy 's units , your ally on the other map receives that unit help him in his own battles .
Likewise , if you lose a unit to your enemy , your ally 's enemy will gain that unit to use against him .
The first team to lose a player loses the game .
The Map
Download
The map , as shown here , is split in two symmetrical halves .
On the left , Player 1 fight against Player 3 , and on the right , Player 2 fights against Player 4 .
The map is extensively decorated , and though the overview of this small picture does not show it , it is quite pleasant in game .

The map is extensively decorated , and though the overview of this small picture does not show it , it is quite pleasant in game .
Rules
- Players on the left map cannot send units to the right , and vice versa .
- Units killed on one map spawn around a civilian on the other .
- If one player loses all his buildings , his ally 's units are destroyed .
- If your civilian is killed , you are punished by having all your minerals and gas reset to zero .

-Units killed on one map spawn around a civilian on the other .
- If one player loses all his buildings , his ally 's units are destroyed .
- If your civilian is killed , you are punished by having all your minerals and gas reset to zero .
Tips
- Civilians have low health , but in the early game there is very little threat .
Use them to scout for proxies and other cheesy strategies .
- If your ally 's opponent is the same race as you , your supply will build up very quickly .
Build extra farms to compensate for this .
- Units that die on this map do not actually leave the map .
Armies will be traded back and forth and only become bigger each time .
- If you are doing a risky build that involves high tech units such as Dark Templar , make sure your ally has detection in case you lose them .
- Some units are less useful to your ally 's opponent than others .
If you lose High Templar , and your ally 's opponent can't research psi storm , he will only be able to morph them into archons .

Alt :
As you can see the layout of the map is very simple .
This is the initial version as a proof of concept , but it is very fun none the less .
In the future , a more complex map may be created .
The Rules
All players are Protoss ( for the sake of balance on a simple map )
When you kill an enemy unit , your ally receives that unit beside his psi emitter for him to use .
When one player on a team loses all his or her buildings , the game is over and that team loses .
Any unit that tries to fly thru the centre to get to the other side of the map is destroyed .
Advisements
If you have two skilled players , and two not so skilled players , Tandem StarCraft is an excellent way to keep games fresh and interesting .
Unlike regular 2v2 where the skilled players would end up doing all the work , in Tandem StarCraft if a skilled player faces off against a weak player , and the same is true for the other side of the map , the weaker player will gain the reinforcements of his skillful ally to help keep the game fun for everyone .
Keeping track of your psi emitter and making sure your enemy does n't steal it can be an important factor in this game .
and enemy who surronds your psi emitter will essentially make his allies units everlasting .
Teching intelligently will be key to success in this matchup .
If your opponent gets a dark templar your ally has foolishly lost , you better make sure you have the detection to stop it .
Supply could build up very quickly since essentially units will never leave the map .
Make sure you compensate with more pylons than normal .

There exists a popular variant of Chess called " Tandem Chess . "
In Tandem Chess two teams of two players each play on two separate boards .
If a piece is captured on one board , the player 's ally who captured the peice , gets to place the piece on his board anywhere in the centre .
The first team to checkmate on either board wins .

When the year draws to close , it ’s time to take stock of what you are doing to increase your overall tax efficiency .
If you are looking to lower your taxes , another way is to sell some of your losing investments to offset capital gains and up to $ 3,000 of your taxable income .
The deduction you get for selling your losing investments can dull some of the pain associated with a less than stellar year for your portfolio .
How Does Tax Loss Harvesting Work ?
Here are some of the basics of selling your losing investments :
Use investment losses to offset capital gains .
First , the total loss from the sale of your losing investments is count against your capital gains , which directly lower the taxes you pay .
Paper losses do n’t count .
You have to sell — and clear — the stocks by the end of the year .
If you have $ 15,000 in losses and $ 10,000 in gains , you can offset the gains , and still have $ 5,000 “ left . ”
You can reduce up to $ 3,000 of your taxable income if married filing jointly ( $ 1,500 if single ) with investment losses :
So do n’t get too carried away and sell everything .
Carefully consider which investments to sell , and consider how they match up with your capital gains .
In our example above , you can use $ 3,000 of that $ 5,000 to reduce your taxable income ( use Schedule D for this ) .
Even those in a lower tax bracket can see some savings .
Carry your losses forward to another year :
Since you still have $ 2,000 “ left , ” you can carry it forward to another year .
This way , you “ bank ” your losses for use another year .
However , you should be careful ; you are still limited on the amount you can reduce your taxable income by , so piling up too many losses can start to lose its luster .
Carefully plan out how you will do this .
It can be wise to sell investments you think are unlikely to recover in the future .
Tax Loss Harvesting Examples
According to Betterment , their “ Tax Loss Harvesting + ” portfolio outperforms their standard portfolio by 0.77 % — source Betterment .
According to Personal Capital , tax - loss harvesting could add up to 0.30 % in annual after - tax returns to your taxable accounts .
Assuming $ 590 k initial investment , this could increase the value of your taxable accounts by $ 109,929 over 25 years .
— source Personal Capital .
Tax Loss Harvesting is NOT a Year - End Only Activity
A critical concept that you wo n’t hear too much about is to tax loss harvest throughout the year and not just at the end of the year .
Why ?
If you have an investment the lost a substantial amount of value , it is a good idea to lock in your loss now and replace it with another investment .
There are so many investment options out there that it is not that difficult to avoid the wash sale rule , and by locking in your loss now , you are guaranteed to capture some tax savings .
Another reason you may want to take your losses before the end of the year is to make sure that you have short - term losses to offset short - term capital gains ( which is taxed at a higher rate ) .
On the other hand , if you wait until the end of the year , you may lose the opportunity to sell your losing investments .
Overall , this is no brainer move because you can capture your losses while keeping your money fully invested .
The Wash Sale Rule
Things to watch out for during this process include the IRS “ wash sale rule . ”
Be aware that the IRS will disallow deductions on losses if you sell your stock and then buy something that is “ substantially identical ” within 30 days .
If you plan to sell losing investments as a tax play , you have to be careful of what you buy for a month afterward .
Bottom Line
It is a good idea to talk to a trusted tax professional about your options as you contemplate how you can dull the pain of an investment loss .
At the very least , you should formulate a plan that allows you to take the best advantage by getting rid of investments that are unlikely to succeed going forward and matching them up with some of your capital gains .
Tax efficiency is a bit of an art , but with some research and / or professional help , you should be able to streamline things so that you owe less than you thought .
Financial writer Jason Kelly recently made a startling discovery about investor appetite for insanely risky ETFs .
Last Friday , he posted a satirical article called First 100x Leveraged ETFs .
It made fun of the trend toward higher leverage among ETF products .
He used the bogus symbols SOAR and SINK for the two fake ETFs mentioned , the former following the index at 100x and the latter following the inverse of the index at 100x .
Soon after he published the piece he was deluged with emails .
Many people got the joke .
But a full 65 % expressed interest in some form or another in owning SOAR and SINK .
What 's even more unbelievable is that the description of the ETFs should have tipped off almost anyone that they were fake .
" These are intended for attentive traders only , " said Kelly Capital Chief Executive Officer Jason Kelly at the press conference following the launch party in New York City .
" The extreme leverage employed will cause both funds to go bankrupt within the course of most trading days .
However , those paying attention during the day will be able to maneuver in and out of the funds before they crash to zero . "
Kelly Capital will reset and relaunch the funds at the beginning of each trading day .
The company is in talks with the Security and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) about the possibility of relaunching the funds after lunch should they go bust in the morning session , but the SEC is balking .
SEC spokesperson Ben Meriwether remarked , " We recognize the right of investors to employ as much leverage needed to find fortune or ruin in a day , we just are n't sure of the need to extend that right twice per day . "
Kelly thinks the SEC will come around to his firm's way of thinking on the issue , but is happy for now that investors will have access to the funds at least once per day .
" Investors these days are n't content to wait years for returns on their investment .
They want to know the outcome as quickly as possible , and at 100x leverage our products currently offer the fastest investment outcomes . "

Well I must say .
The Deniers are a slick lot .
They 've had me questioning the global warming argument myself sometimes .
But then I remember the North - West passage is open for the first time in human history and I 'm back from la-la land again .
But my bigger concern is how the situation is being hijacked at the " elite " business level where we have no democratic representation .
Financial securitization of pollution as a means to control it through capitalism may be an intuitive way to enforce laws by channeling free - market incentives but I would much prefer the older , simpler and less obscure method of tax levies .
Already I hear Goldman Sachs will soon be trading in carbon cap futures and once again it appears the middle - men of commerce will be digging their long fingers into the pot of the real economy ripping out chunks of resources expressed as dollars to pile into their virtual pots of cash .
They need to do this , of course , because they create nothing of value themselves despite the diligent rhetoric crafted by their teams of PR reps and lawyers .
The need to endlessly plunder the effort of others is their only source of income and nothing , not even our global future , is more sacred than that next bonus .

Your concerns are certainly meritorious ( and it 's appreciated that they do n't come couched in the wingnut denialist rhetoric ) .
I 'm not particularly in support of the current House / Senate legislation for cap and trade here , but the fact is a tax would be used as a bludgeon against Dems , and is simply not political feasible , as I see it .
( Look how they 're even calling Cap and Trade a tax when it is n't ! )
Furthermore , a tax would put the onus directly on tax - payers as companies simply passed on whatever taxes were levied onto their customers .
Whereas a competitive market - based cap and trade system ( if appropriately implemented , of course ) would offer the added benefits of forcing the polluters themselves to curb emissions , or else be bested by those companies who do .
So there is a market - based , conservative incentive in place with Cap and Trade --- which has shown itself to work very well in the past , btw , as we highlighted in our most recent Green News Report .
Again , not necessarily arguing that cap and trade is the only way to go , and certainly not arguing in favor of the current Congressional legislation .
Just trying to offer a slightly larger picture of the issues , beyond the very valid ones you present in your comment above .

Built for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Force to serve as a supply ship for isolated , far - flung Arctic RCMP detachments , St. Roch was also designed to serve when frozen - in for the winter as a floating detachment with its constables mounting dog sled patrols from the ship .
Between 1929 and 1939 St. Roch made three voyages to the Arctic .
Between 1940 and 1942 St. Roch navigated the Northwest Passage , arriving in Halifax harbor on October 11 , 1942 .
St. Roch was the second ship to make the passage , and the first to travel the passage from west to east .
In 1944 , St. Roch returned to Vancouver via the more northerly route of the Northwest Passage , making her run in 86 days .
The epic voyages of St. Roch demonstrated Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic during the difficult wartime years , and extended Canadian control over its vast northern territories .

Big Oil is in their " death throes " , and pulled out all the stops with all their media before the climate change summit .
The timing of the hacked emails that were years old came right before the climate summit .
What a coincidence .
Everything added up to the real hoax being the shills claiming the hoax .
Rush Limbaugh will be in a death throe all next week still pitching something that no one believes .
Actually , the tide seems to be turning on the propagandists .
Back in time a little , before all these propagandists were hammered upon by independent media , they got away with things like this .
If the Monica Lewinsky thing happened now , it would n't have worked to the extent it did back then .
We 're all wise to it now .
And you know what ?
There will be something after this .
Just in recent memory , it went from " Pallin ' with terrorists " , Joe the Plumber , Obama birth certificate , ACORN , then Global Warming hoax .
They 're all lined up one after another , is anyone noticing this ?
We just have to point out the next one when it happens .
One after another after another , there 's a schedule somewhere , believe me !
Each one comes out of left field , unexpected .
But when you expect something , it 's easy to identify it when it happens .
What will the next one be ?
The Global Warming summit is coming to an end , what 's on the schedule this coming week for the new rightwing fabrication ?
Breitbart did Oscar the Grouch , too , but that was a minor one .
They have to throw in puppet related ones once in a while , like the Purple Teletubby .
Maybe they 'll get the Evangelicals to picket a movie or something , instead of picketing the wars .

Disclaimer : I do not own stock , invest , or support big industry of any sort .
My house of 2 people own 4 bikes and 1 car ...
I do support non partisan fact searching , and truth seeking .
These are excerpts from the same article in order to add a balance : E - mails stolen from climate scientists show they stonewalled skeptics and discussed hiding data and The 1,073 e-mails examined by the AP show that scientists harbored private doubts .. even as they told the world they were certain about climate change .
even worse :
The scientists were so convinced by their own science and so driven by a cause " that unless you 're with them , you 're against them , " said Mark Frankel and " I do now wish I 'd never sent them the data after their FOIA request ! "
Jones wrote in June 2007 .
and Sometimes the data did n't line up as perfectly as scientists wanted .
No , politicized science is not so pretty at all .
I do n't know why but I am reminded of 2007 when Al Gore was found to be using 200 % more energy per year in his 20 room mansion than others in the area .
He said he was in the process of changing to compact light bulbs ...
That was years after his fear inducing movie .
Does he have jet lag ?
To Big Dan : I agree that Big Oil is in its death bed , but I think it is the Green movement that will keep the Fat Cats Pockets Fat .
Big Oil was manipulated and monopolized , eventually we stopped supporting ourselves with our own resources and foreign policy was born , now we have the war on terror ...
All of this is designed to keep the machine going .

Brian R-comment # 10 Balance is good .
So is being a stickler for detail .
But whatever caveats one might squeeze about the reality of climate change from the imperfect behavior of a few scientists seem terribly mild compared to the claims of the climate change deniers that the emails provide more dramatic proof that climate change ain't happening .
I 'm not sure exactly where you come down on this but I 'm extremely wary of false equivalences here .
The melting icecaps and glaciers around the world are infinitely more meaningful than this red herring .
And I do n't know the specifics of Al Gore 's home energy use but whether he 's being a perfect example in his own life or not says nothing about the realities depicted so clearly in his film .

Citing the AP and factcheck as authorities is ludicrous .
Words are not the language of science .
Mathematics is the language of science .
Journalists posess very little in the way of quantitative analytical skills .
At least acknowledge that the emails cast doubt and uncertainty on the science at CRU .
There can be no doubt about the fact that CRU has violated data retention and methodology sharing ethics that have been codified tenets of academic research for decades .
Whether this invalidates the CRU results is still an open question .
One should wait until quantitative analysis of the data , methods , and algorithms are performed --- under the scientific ethics of full disclosure , data sharing and transparency .
At that point we can draw conclusions about what the efforts at CRU prove or disprove

This is for Jallen @ # 13 : AP themselves did not do any review .
They contracted industry experts to do this review .
From the Article : seven experts in research ethics , climate science and science policy .
Much quantitative analysis of the data , methodology and algorithms has already been performed .
And this analysis hhas universally acknowledged that The ice IS melting and that there is significant evidence suggesting that human behavior over the past century plus has contributed significantly .
You 've chosen to question this finding because , for some reason , the astroturf funded and published skepticism has convinced a large enough percentage of ( generally christian conservative ) people that 98 % of the worlds climatologists are somehow conspiring to weaken the United Sates .
These hacked emails are being touted as evidence of just such a conspiracy .
What the staff hired by the Associated press has found , however , is the emails show no such thing .
What they do show is human frailty , and some difficulty , especially early on , in undertsanding their own data .
But the premise of some world wide conspiracy of scientists working to take down the United States , even on it 's surface , is ludicrous .
The REAL conspiracy , however , begins to take shape once you dig beneath the surface of the roots of Global Warming skepticism by following the money .

One must ask why is there an association or correlation between a conservative religious agenda and climate change denial ?
What conservative principle mandates opposition to environmentalism ?
There seems to be an accommodation between big business and religion to the effect that corporate interests will push or espouse theocracy ( which costs nothing ) in exchange for churches defending the interests of " the military industrial complex " .
Sweet deal , but I think not made in heaven .

It 's quite probable that the scientists " questionable " actions were based on the notion that it is important for the planet that action be taken and soon .
In a normal scientific inquiry there is little concern for urgency .
I believe their desire to limit public attention for opposition was an expression of fear that giving any ammunition to conservatives would prove harmful in a very real sense .
Furthermore , there was a suspicion ( at least ) that opposition was motivated more by politics than science .

Jallen at 13 - So , you are saying we should take personal comments in emails and evaluate those comments in order to decide whether global warming is real or not ?
Also , you should read what you have posted .
It makes no sense at all .
Indeed , mathematics is the language of science .
That is why , when translated into a very non-science language like English , pinheads like " lush " , amongst others , feel free to misinterpret and fantasize as much as they do .
To anyone with the faintest understanding of mathematics , the message is clear that global warming is , indeed , active and the prime driver is human activity .
The fact that you think there is some sort of conspiracy simply because the pieces are not in the places you think they ought to be is a shame and reflects on your lack of intelligence more than anything else .
and me just pointing out that the scientific process , including peer review , is a vital part of research and keeping out political input ( opinion ) is a prime foundation does not make me an " elite " .

Just for the record , those opposed to action on climate change are not " conservatives " .
They are rightwingers , corporatists , tea baggers , denialists , but not conservatives .
That label continues to be used as a ruse to convince the public they have " conservative " values when they decidedly do not .

Re the liberal media .
Of course now we have a predictably rapid response in right wing media but it was n't too many years ago that ' corporatists ' used to complain that all the media was liberal .

@ BrianR in Comment 21 .
To say that human activity does not impact our environment and our weather is to deny our own recorded history .
We stopped the destruction of our own forests in the north east , due to acid rain , by altering our behavior as a nation .
We turned the tide on the shrinking ozone layer by altering our behavior as a planet .
And to cherry pick your data regarding the loss of so many glaciers in order to show a few that are growing shows how deeply misinformed you are .
http://www.google.com/se...2&q=glaciers+growing
I suggest that YOU stop buying the fabricated hype and look at this as any rational capitalist would .
As the greatest opportunity in the world today .
Not only does getting off of fossil fuels defang the politically powerful oil companies , it creates hundreds of new industries and millions of new jobs .
And you stand in the way of this effort by spouting ignorant and non-factual rhetoric .
We need these industries because we 've shipped so many of our traditional industries overseas .

Even if some of the scientists involved in climate change stats were biased and had an agenda , how it possible to think their bias is more than that of people and scientists representing big oil , coal , energy , big businesses who really dislike what man made climate change might make .
Its like only scientist concerned about enviroment are capable or likely to twist the truth , big businesses would never do that , they are always pure , others are always the scammers , like govt is always bad , businesses always perfect moral actors .
Truth is we should be skeptical on all sides , even when not having a preset agenda , science can get set in orthodoxies that are later shown to be wrong but no way I automacially think climate change scientist less trustworty than deniers .

I hope this clarifies .

Partially correct : From the article ” As part of the AP review , summaries of the e-mails that raised issues from the potential manipulation of data to intensely personal attacks were sent to seven experts in research ethics , climate science and science policy . ”
Much less rigorous - sounding than the cherry - picked phrase .
Although , I will concede you a point to a degree .
Dan @ 15 : “ You 've chosen to question this finding because … ” Rather presumptuous .
I question the finding solely on academic grounds and my questioning is limited to CRU .
I have given little thought to the issue before reviewing the emails .
I ’ve only gotten involved due to the science and academic issues .
I could care less what the politicians do .
I will make my way quite well as I have for the past half century .
So matters of public policy concern me not .
But for some reason , I am intrigued by the scientific and mathematic aspects of the issue .
Dan , please know that I never attribute to conspiracy what is more likely attributed to incompetence .

But that is why I am intrigued by the issues , my friend .

Here is the crux of climategate ( assuming the reader is familiar with the FOIA and the " lost " source data aspects of the issue ) : Ensuring the Integrity , Accessibility , and
Stewardship of Research Data in the Digital Age ISBN : 978-0-309-13684-6 National Academy of Sciences .
http://www.nap.edu/html/12615/12615_EXS.pdf
Data Access and Sharing Principle : Research data , methods , and other information integral to publicly reported results should be publicly accessible .
Recommendation 5 : All researchers should make research data , methods , and other information integral to their publicly reported results publicly accessible in a timely manner to allow verification of published findings and to enable other researchers to build on published results …
Data Stewardship Principle : Research data should be retained to serve future uses .
Data that may have long - term value should be documented , referenced , and indexed so that others can find and use them accurately and appropriately .
Curating data requires documenting , referencing , and indexing the data so that they can be used accurately and appropriately in the future .
Recommendation 9 : Researchers should establish data management plans at the beginning of each research project that include appropriate provisions for the stewardship of research data .
The solution to this problem — as with so many others — is honesty .
At the minimum , the CRU utterly failed in the Data Access and Data Stewardship principles .
Unforgivable .
While I stated One should wait until quantitative analysis of the data , methods , and algorithms are performed --- under the scientific ethics of full disclosure , data sharing and transparency .
I will be willing to wager the investigations now commencing will find egregious violations by CRU of the two principles cited above .

I saw this AP story in my local paper over the weekend , and I read the story with the hope that there was an actual scientific refutation of fraud based on a data review .
I was dismayed , however , that the story only focused on the text of the emails , not a review of the data .
The emails do not have the ability to prove the correctness of the data .
All they provide is proof that the opinions and conclusions drawn by the authors on the data can not be trusted .
I submit documents of findings and opinions to state regulatory authorities regarding environmental contamination and investigations on a regular basis , and if I ever used tactics or justification for my opinions similar to what these ' scientists ' used , I would lose my credibility and license , and likely cost my company its reputation .
I hope none of you graduated penn state , because if you have , I officially view your degree or credentials with suspicion .
Sorry , but true .
This is a mess that the politicians and their hacks can only make worse .
Maybe there will be a real review of the revealed information by scientists ; until there is ; manmade global warming is dead to me .
It is a shame if you think that I am biased by anything other than the facts .

JAllen , as you 're looking into the science underlying climate change , you might find this story interesting , along with the accompanying demonstration video , from an actual scientist : Lubchenco gives a demonstration of the science of ocean acidification you may be interested in this resource that effectively addresses / debunks the multitude of skeptical arguments being thrown around out there , at SkepticalScience.com .
Mark @ # 36 , that 's just silly .
By that reasoning , journalists should still be questioning whether there are WMDs in Iraq because some people still think so , in the absence of actual verifiable evidence .
As we 've said on every thread on this subject :
The hacked emails contain nothing that overturns ANY of the evidence from the field data gathered in multiple other earth systems disciplines --- even if you threw out everything that ever came out of the CRU .
If you find any evidence anywhere that shows the oceans are n't acidifying , overall melt rates for glaciers and ice sheets are n't accelerating , global average temperatures are not the hottest in recorded history , species and migrations ranges are not shifting , the hydrological cycles are not shifting , precipitation patterns are not shifting , and Arctic and Pacific Island villagers can return to their ravaged villages ... and presents a plausible theory as to why all of these observed , verified events are occurring ... please link to it and let us all know !
Oh , and do n't forget to include any scientific evidence that overturns the basic physics of CO2 / GHG interaction with solar radiation , and the basic chemistry of CO2 and seawater ...

I found this interesting response to AP on the conflict of interest that their writer Seth Borenstein ( of this article ) has entered into .
My email to AP :
Please forward to :
Paul Colford , Director of Media Relations
Jack Stokes , Manager of Media Relations
( as listed on AP ’s ‘ Contact Us ’ page )
I am a science teacher who is reading through the facts and opinions of the CRU ‘ Climategate ’ email and files in order to present my students with both sides of the debate .
I have turned to the Associated Press coverage of many issues in the past , depending on your collective work for accurate quotes , balanced coverage , and unbiased reporting .
Today , I read a review entitled “ E - mails show pettiness , not fraud ” , linked here : http://www.msnbc.msn.com...ns/us_news-environment//
The review was authored in part by AP employee Seth Borenstein , and the authors ’ ultimate conclusion is that the emails do not show any problems with the science or the data but merely reveal the scientists being petty and human .
This is a fair opinion from an outsider , and one worth taking into account .
However , I was troubled to find that Mr. Borenstein is not an outsider ; in fact , he is one of the correspondents in the emails .
On July 23 , 2009 , Mr. Borenstein wrote an email to ‘ Kevin , Gavin , and Mike ’ , three of the principle climate scientists involved in the emails .
The email is archived here , in a nested reply : http://www.eastangliaema...;filename=1248790545.txt
Mr. Borenstein wrote :
Kevin , Gavin , Mike ,
It ’s Seth again .
Attached is a paper in JGR today that

Whatchya think ?

In my mind , this reads as the correspondence of an insider and a person who has a specific viewpoint .
I have no problem with Mr. Borenstein having these views , but I am suspicious that there is a conflict of interest when he is supposed to be reporting in an unbiased and objective matter on the same material .
His opinion of the emails ’ contents has clearly been stretched into the review of referenced above .
Because he is part of the email set that he is reviewing , I believe he should recuse himself of this story as a party with a conflict of interest .
The media , and especially the gold standard of the AP , has a responsibility to separate themselves from the stories they cover .
Mr. Borenstein cannot separate himself from this issue because he is in the emails , so he should not be reporting on it , in my opinion .
According to the The Associated Press Statement of News Values and Principles ( linked here : http://www.ap.org/newsvalues/index.html ) :
… ultimately , it means it is the responsibility of every one of us to ensure that these standards are upheld .
Any time a question is raised about any aspect of our work , it should be taken seriously .
I am questioning an aspect of Mr. Borenstein ’s work , and I believe it should be taken seriously by him and by your organization .
The following two sections from the Statement of News Values and Principles also apply :
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The AP respects and encourages the rights of its employees to participate actively in civic , charitable , religious , public , social or residential organizations .
However , AP employees must avoid behavior or activities – political , social or financial – that create a conflict of interest or compromise our ability to report the news fairly and accurately , uninfluenced by any person or action .
Nothing in this policy is intended to abridge any rights provided by the National Labor Relations Act .
EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION :
Anyone who works for the AP must be mindful that opinions they express may damage the AP ’s reputation as an unbiased source of news .
They must refrain from declaring their views on contentious public issues in any public forum , whether in Web logs , chat rooms , letters to the editor , petitions , bumper stickers or lapel buttons , and must not take part in demonstrations in support of causes or movements .
I request that these concerns be forwarded to Mr. Borenstein ’s editors and supervisors .
I would appreciate an acknowledgement of receipt of this request and a response from Mr. Borenstein and other members of your staff that address conflict of interest issues .
Thank you .

Just to be clear , I think this climategate crap is a tempest in a teapot brought up to obfuscate the real science and the appallingly small offering of the United States at COP15 .
The fact that the use of statistical analysis on some aspects of the research on AGW cannot do what they so desperately want it to do , for reasons abounding even all the pressure they are under to come up with it ... to wit : money , funding for their departments ... in no way besmirches the avalanche of hard science that is unequivocal about this mess .
It 's at the point where it is idiocy to squabble over whether it is anthropogenic .
We know there are mitigating measures we can take , and it is suicide not to take them .
We 're talking about mass extinction event level catastrophe ... not some political mileage from trolls making this into a wedge issue polemic .
The damage is not limited to your political opponents :
It 's to every living thing .
It is perfectly okay by me if people insist on depriving plutocrats of the fortunes they want to make on this too , but NOT at the price of waiting another second to do the kinds of things that might avert the worst of this catastrophe .
There is every solidly - based - in - hard - science reason for all humankind to be on this right now .
All this climategate crap accomplished was a sideshow .
This is on a par with a giant meteor on its way to smacking into our planet , and scientists trying to get missiles shot to break it up , while right wingnuts and anti-fascist lefties alike fight like hell to distract from the imperative to act .

BigDan – Sorry to disappoint on the whole ball of wax thing !
Regarding “ do you want to stay on Big Oil … ”
My current position is : Pursuing alternative energy , energy independence , and clean energy are worthy goals in and of themselves .
Let ’s consider this a “ no regrets ” strategy .
Hypothetically and for sake of discussion , let 's set aside the climate issue and also set aside whether the " no regrets strategy " would ( if all goals were attained ) impact climate .
Again , for discussion only .
We are left with enacting unilateral domestic economic incentives ( taxes and tax credits and R&D incentives ) that provide a smooth and steady path to these goals .
Again , a wise domestic course economically and geopolitically , regardless of climate issues .
It will certainly provide our domestic economy with a competitive advantage .
International long - term collaborative action is futile , because these agreements will surely be abrogated , regardless of the immediacy of climate issues , or lack thereof .
It is a pipe dream that other nations without economic staying power or political stability will adhere to international CO2 cap and trade rubrics .
The bilateral agreements will fail because certain nations , even developed western nations , will eventually act in parochial self - interest due to domestic problems that arise over time .
Moreover , when the first “ developed ” nation abrogates the agreement or comes back to the table to renegotiate , others surely will follow .
Then the entire framework will collapse in the intermediate term .
By the same token , any form of payments , incentives , foreign aid or technology / resource sharing to underdeveloped countries to assist them in meeting emissions targets , will similarly fail due to corruption or incompetence .
I hate to sound cynical , but these bilateral agreements will fail in the intermediate term due to the reasons stated above .
That said , were I a policy - maker , I would encourage a measured march to the goals through non-drastic unilateral domestic action .
@DES # 45 – Thank you for sharing the article and link .
I am open - minded as to its position , and will look further into it as I consider my positions .

While a component of recent global warming may have been caused by the increased solar activity of the last solar cycle , that component was very small compared to the effects of additional greenhouse gases .
According to a NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) press release , " ... the solar increases do not have the ability to cause large global temperature increases ... greenhouse gases are indeed playing the dominant role ... "

I thought carbon dioxide was bad until I researched both sides of the debate as to its effect on the health of our planet .
I was convinced by the the side that says this life gas has very little effect on temperature , and in fact usually shows up in greater quantities after global warming .
Many of you , on the other hand , believe the science is settled , and that those of us who believe otherwise are akin to holocaust deniers .
That we are in many ways a pathetic and retarded lot who only imagine there are real scientists , yes climatologists , who actually have proven to at least an equal number of thinking individuals that the science is at best hardly settled .
For every scientist who agrees with the anthropogenic warming theory , I could name one who says that there are other influences of far greater impact than man's on the changes in climate and temperature .
What we are witnessing , I think , is scaremongering for global taxes beyond the representation and power of the electorate to ever resist , and a carbon trading scheme which will kill millions in the third world , make a lot of creepy control freaks even richer , destroy the sovereignty of the U.S.A. , and destroy what 's left of our industry .
At the same time China will more than make up any difference our carbon reductions would have on the weather , if that is indeed possible .
The global club will have more wealth and power and continue life as they always have comforted by the fact that the noose has grown tighter around the slaves as these elites rush headlong into the New World Order ( or global governance , as Al Gore describes it ) they are always talking about .
I want my children to live in a country free of genetically modified foods and animals , poisons in our water supplies , overgrazing , radical deforestation , endless wars of aggression , etc . .
I think these are greater threats to our planet than carbon dioxide .
I also want my children to be free .
The real issue with global warming is that the proposed solutions will enslave us .
Maybe , when you ask " cui bono ? , " from all this fear - mongering , which used to be about global cooling a few decades ago , at least consider that it might be those who could care less about the planet or humanity , but only want most of us enslaved or dead , so that they alone can inherit the Earth .
Just a crazy thought , I know .

There is only one explanation for how it came to be .
Nuclear weapons were used against us by the powers that be .
Does the AP report this truth ?
No .

Mark Fredrickson @ 58 For every scientist who agrees with the anthropogenic warming theory , I could name one who says that there are other influences of far greater impact than man's on the changes in climate and temperature .
Okay , here 's a survey fromScience Daily from earlier this year detailing 3,146 earth scientists who " overwhelmingly agree that in the past 200 - plus years , mean global temperatures have been rising , and that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures . "
Your turn .
( Hint in advance : Before you " name " back to me that bogus " Global Warming Petition Project " showing " 31,000 scienctists " who disagree , please know that petition is bunk .
So I 've named 3,146 earth scientists for ya .
Please get back to me with your own 3,146 .
The real issue with global warming is that the proposed solutions will enslave us .
Were we " enslaved " by previous such cap and trade plans ( ones that happened to have worked ) to curb acid rain and deal with the ozone issue ?
If those did n't enslave us , why will this one ?
Why would such a word even be used in this context here , but for those who oppose such plans entirely inserting such words into the discussion to freak the crap out of otherwise well - meaning folks ?

But you are willing to believe that the motivations of those forming a world government and taxing each of us for our carbon footprint are benevolent .

That this time these people who have sucked the world of much of its wealth are going to do the right thing ?
Argue all you want that carbon dioxide will be the death of us .
I think there are a lot of other gases far worse , but the majority of us can't be put under yet another new system of control over our everyday lives as effectively except by the regulation and control of our carbon footprint .

As I 've said many times ... I 'm not sold on cap 'n trade either .
I am however sold on the fact that climate change is happening and it's cause by human activity .
Brad has cited Montreal and other agreements where cap 'n trade like measures have worked very well , it just seems you 've ignored those comments .

There is NO scientific evidence against Global Warming .
None .
The only issue in contention ( and really , just barely , though magnetized to an actual " issue " by the wingbagger denialists ) is whether the warming is caused by man in part , in totality , or none at all .
The vast consensus of the majority of legit earth scientists believe it 's man made ( otherwise known as Anthropogenic Global Warming ) .
As noted upthread Okay , here 's a survey from Science Daily from earlier this year detailing 3,146 earth scientists who " overwhelmingly agree that in the past 200 - plus years , mean global temperatures have been rising , and that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures .

Do n't be so quick to jump into your politics .
Check out some real facts .
http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/146138
There is “ no real scientific proof ” that the current warming is caused by the rise of greenhouse gases from man ’s activity .
Man -made carbon dioxide emissions throughout human history constitute less than 0.00022 percent of the total naturally emitted from the mantle of the earth during geological history .
The science of what determines the earth ’s temperature is in fact far from settled or understood .
Just because someone links skeptical reports to a " Republican " ( of which I am not ) or " Big Business " ( also of which I am not ) does n't mean you should kneejerk react to it in a religeous way ( i.e. without checking facts ) .
Again , if anyone wants to go outside and look up at that huge ball of fire in the sky which heats our planet , then we will not have to pay more of our hard - earned money to these BIG BUSINESSES who will regulate our way of life .

Do n't be so quick to jump into your politics .
Check out some real facts .
It was blown out of the water because as it relates to climate change ; the AP , the emails or the cacophany from deniers that have suckled this manufactered controversy like mother 's milk does n't add one tittle to the debate of climate change .
It 's a straw man .
You see sir ; the emails did n't dispute climate change or contradict the reality of it .
That fact was dealt with way up thread ... had you read the comments you would n't be taking this conversation back to square one .
Unless you intended to make this a merry go round of your ignorance .
You have n't demonstrated any evidence that the stolen emails debunk man made climate change .
There is no need to defend what has n't been properly challenged .
There is “ no real scientific proof ” that the current warming is caused by the rise of greenhouse gases from man ’s activity .
DNK
I 'm not gonna retrace what 's already been done in this very thread .
Too many people have posted solid scientific evidence that man made global warming is happening .
I 'm not gonna do your homework for you ... read back find a commenter that accepts climate change as real ... follow the links they provide .
Man -made carbon dioxide emissions throughout human history constitute less than 0.00022 percent of the total naturally emitted from the mantle of the earth during geological history .
Is n't it funny ... you use the term " throughout human history "
When the debate is since the industrial age , which is a tad over 100 years .
read this if you dare
The science of what determines the earth ’s temperature is in fact far from settled or understood .
It 's the ocean temp nimrod .
Just because someone links skeptical reports to a " Republican " ( of which I am not ) or " Big Business " ( also of which I am not ) does n't mean you should kneejerk react to it in a religeous way ( i.e. without checking facts ) .

Actually " skeptical reports " have n't been factual .
It 's not a republican thing , it 's just that most deniers happen to vote GOP ... What folks here are " kneejerk " reacting to is untruths as disseminated by the corporate media machine .
There are many facts here that obviously you have n't checked or bothered to consider .... you 're projecting like a search light now .
Big Business is already regulating your way of life .
Big Business writes and passes the legislation you live by ... you pay their bills , you lap up their propaganda ... you live by their dictates .
They own your government .
You 'll protect them from any responsibility for their actions at all costs and then project it onto us .

" Sorry , CO2 is good , not bad .

CO2 is neither ' good ' nor ' bad ' , DNK .
It just exists .
The issue is what happens when we add more CO2 than the earth 's processes can naturally absorb at the rate we 've historically enjoyed .
One way of illustrating this would be to lock you in a sealed room with a houseplant and pump that room full of all that ' good ' CO2 --- then watch what happens to both of you .
Scientists say the houseplant would be affected and you would n't survive --- but why would you believe a bunch of scientists who are just after more research money , after all , until you 've seen the results for yourself ?
' Pollution is bad ' .
Yes .
The way our system works now , pollution is free for industry - business pockets the profits and leaves the bill for cleanup to you , the taxpayer .
You also get to pay for the impacts on public health , too , btw .
Privatize the profits , socialize the pollution .
Here 's a direct response to your link , FWIW : 50 Reasons Why Global Warming Is n't Natural A British newspaper today published a list of " 100 reasons why global warming is natural " .
Here we take a quick look at the first 50 of their claims - and debunk each one .
Of course , even at the 100 list , they 've accepted the scientific evidence that the earth is indeed warming .
It would save us all a lot of time if everybody would go first to the very detailed Skeptical Science.com , to see if whatever you 're about to claim has been debunked already .
You also might be interested in seeing if you fit into one of these categories : ' How to comment on ClimateGate : a handy reference guide ' .
And we 're still waiting to see some linked , sourced evidence from anyone that overturns any the field data in any of the other earth systems disciplines that are independent of the CRU emails , temperature data and models , that overturns the basic physics of CO2 / GHGs and solar radiation , or that overturns the basic chemistry of seawater interaction with CO2 , or that shows glaciers and ice sheets are not exhibiting accelerating melt rates overall , species and ranges and not shifting , the hyrodological cycle is not shifting , sea level is n't rising , atmospheric CO2 is not increasing ... or anything like that .

BRAD , I stopped watching television 9 years ago -- the best thing I ever did for the health of my brain .
FOX news is a strange animal owned by a leftist who markets to the truly ignorant right .
I am a Constitutionalist , and therefore no mainstream media exists for people like me .
You are a very focused individual who knows very little of what 's happening among the governments of the world and their efforts to establish a New World Order and carbon footprint tax to fund it .
Do n't expect me to prove something that you can research and find in a hour through Google from both mainstream and alternative news research .
What is going on in Copenhagen is a push toward global governance .
You 're a journalist ; you can find all the evidence you need .
It 's not difficult .
And concerning Alex Jones : I discovered him about three years ago .
I agree with him on most things .
I came to my own conclusions about Bush 's reference to the New World Order before I started listening to Jones , mainly as a result of what happened at Waco , Ruby Ridge , OKC bombing and especially 911 .
The government agenda in all these acts of terrorism was pretty obvious : give the people a bogeyman ( Islamo - fascists and militia types ) to fight and they 'll accept a loss of their freedoms .
I see similarities with the war on carbon dioxide .
In the end nothing ever comes of the wars on anything but the enrichment of corporations , the military industrial complex and further control of we the people , as our freedoms are taken from us in exchange for a false security .
I 'm surprised you can't see the big picture .
Believe it or not , the main book to make me aware of all of this was " 1984 . "
I read it in high school , then " Animal Farm , " and " None Dare call it Conspiracy . "
Ever since I was 17 I realized the direction toward globalism and that at some point in the future the main thrust would be to establish a one world government .
Now it so obvious that when I see a journalist of your caliber deny what is in our faces every day , I honestly do n't know what to say .

Poor Brad .
You refuse to investigate on your own , so , ergo , the push for global governance is n't real .
Anyone who rejects outright , science on the other side of an argument is not going to accept any proof I have to offer .
I , at least , have an open mind .
I accept there is a legitimate argument .
You do n't even accept the fact that there is an argument worth considering .
You say that that we 've been warming as of late , when we 've been cooling .
Even Phil Jones admits to that : To : John Christy Subject : This and that Date : Tue Jul 5 15:51:55 2005
The scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had cooled from 1998 .

What is so bizarre about this whole global warming argument for me is the incredible feeling of nausea I had when I took my regular visit to your site and noticed you 'd bought the side of carbon dioxide causing the warming .
I was surprised given your skepticism of paid for agendas .

I 'll still visit your site for other journalism that matters , but on the subject of global warming , your support for what essentially will result in corporate fascism will do nothing but contribute to a life more miserable for you and anyone you care for .
Cyclical global warming wo n't be ameliorated - - it 's natural .
Provide proof that carbon dioxide causes warming .
Provide proof that Medieval warming was harmful , or that any other warming period in Earth 's past led to the destruction that you fear will occur if we do n't go back to the stone age .

COPENHAGEN – Shocked and shaken by the theft of the Auschwitz sign , the world community must now " take note " of another midnight action .
This time its a deal brokered by US President Barack Obama at the largest and most important U.N. meeting ever on fighting global warming .
The new deal , which abandons the most vulnerable of nations along with the world 's biologically rich tropical forests , continues a pattern of what international representatives call a " real lack of transparency " by the White House .
Obama dismissed the UN's criticisms of his unusual and undemocratic negotiating process as " cynicism " while declaring his unbinding document an " unprecedented breakthrough " .
Obama 's document promises to funnel up to $ 100B a year through the UN Development Programme , widely known for its corruption .
" The deal is a triumph of spin over substance , " said Jeremy Hobbs , executive director of Oxfam International , it " kicks back " on the issue of " climate cash " .
Like the Nazis sending " 6 million people into furnaces " in the Holocaust , Obama is condemning the world to wide - spread global warming deaths , other leaders pointed out .
Meanwhile , outside in the cold , hundreds of European protesters chanted and carried signs of Obama with the word " shame " pasted on his face .

Last I knew the Pentagon believes in Global Warming .
You'd think that would be enough for the Wingnuts , but I guess they are part of the conspiracy .

What is anti-X Factor song Killing In The Name all about ?
SMASHED HITS
Classic pop , reappraised by the Magazine
Burning crosses , the " chosen whites " and an unholy refrain of repetitive rudeness .
What is going on in the song likely to be at least this year 's Christmas Number Two ?
Detractors of X Factor are buying Rage Against The Machine 's 1992 single Killing In The Name in the hope of beating the talent show 's winner Joe McElderry to the top spot in the Christmas charts .
SONG STATS Written by Rage Against The Machine ( frontman Zach de la Rocha , left )
First single by LA - based band ( 1992 LA riots , right ) UK # 25 ( February 1993 ) Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Sir Paul backs
Rage to top charts
While anyone who has heard it will be able to describe how the song ends , it 's less clear what 's going on beforehand - other than that it 's very , very angry .
" Some of those that work forces , " it begins , " are the same that burn crosses . "
The band is from Los Angeles and the single was released shortly after fierce riots left parts of the city in flames .
Ku Klux Klan
It started with a crowd storming the police headquarters chanting " Guilty ! Guilty ! " - referring to the acquittal by an all - white jury of the four white officers accused of kicking and clubbing black motorist Rodney King .
In that context , it 's impossible not to hear echoes of the racial tensions around the trial when frontman Zack de la Rocha links policemen to Klansmen .
But it does n't sound like a news report - it sounds like a sermon .
And religion is there in the next line too , a shouted " Killing in the name of ! " ' Chosen whites '
In early - 90s America , that phrase was most often followed by " God " , " freedom " or " democracy " - all sardonic references to the then - recent war in Iraq .
Not the normal subject matter for a Christmas record sleeve Add in the sleeve 's image of Vietnamese monk Quang Duc setting himself alight and we see that the enemy is our old friend the military - industrial complex , justifying killing for the benefit of , as the song puts it , " the chosen whites " .
If you wanted to clean up the line repeated in the final chant , you could try something along the lines of : " Since I believe police officers and law - makers to be institutionally corrupt , I see no need to follow their instructions . "
De la Rocha wants to know what you - yes , you - are going to do about all this , and he 's not shy about getting your attention .
' Awful ' in Asda
The song has since provoked various desired reactions .
As well as being a favourite at political rallies , a Philadelphia police union called for a boycott of the band and its promoters , claiming : " This outfit has openly advocated violence against police officers - this is a hate group , not a music group . "
Some of the other mayhem the song has caused , though , has been much milder .
Last year , Asda apologised after playing the track in a Preston branch , prompting a shopper to complain : " It was awful . "
Brookes ( right ) made a schoolboy error
This week , BBC Radio 5 live apologised after broadcasting a live performance that included four renditions of the line with the swear word - an echo of the trouble caused in the 90s when Bruno Brookes played an unedited version on Radio 1 .
The band never issued a cleaned - up version of Killing , but American radio stations concocted their own .
And the band 's musical legacy is also perhaps not what its members would have wished .
Foremost among the groups to devise a more commercial version of Rage 's rap / rock template was Limp Bizkit , whose less - focused song of rage , Break Stuff , played as fans destroyed the stage and injured passers - by at the 1999 Woodstock festival .
And you can listen to Killing In The Name as you carry out similar rampages in the video game Grand Theft Auto .
Irritating Simon Cowell
So this Christmas is not the first time that this song has found itself in an arguably incongruous context .
NOTABLE VERSIONS Biffy Clyro ( acoustic ballad )
Rage live on BBC Radio 5 live L - Plus ( drum ' n ' bass ) SebastiAn ( techno ) FourPlay ( string quartet ) Apples ( jazz - funk ) Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Now the " you " that " I wo n't do what you tell me " refers to is X Factor , while some are trying to suggest the music industry has been assimilated into the military - industrial complex , most seem to want to have a laugh and irritate Simon Cowell .
However , the most unlikely episode in the life of Killing was when it was reported as being among the songs played at maximum volume during the interrogation of detainees in the " War on Terror " .
Rage 's guitarist Tom Morello decried American soldiers " playing music for 72 hours in a row at volumes just below that to shatter the eardrums " .
" The fact that music I helped create was used in crimes against humanity sickens me , " he added .
Given that , it 's less of a surprise the revival of the song in a light - hearted festive prank , exposing new fans to its ferocity as well as making a bob or two , has elicited from the group less of a restive " f " you and more of a festive " thank you " .

Well , kind of .
Our boys at Clicky ( awesome site analytics service , by the way ) released a report this morning compiled of data from over 150,000 websites which have their tracking code installed .
It ’s a pretty large sample size , and what they found was that the DROID , less than a week old , already accounts for around 25 % of all Android traffic they see in the United States .

Humans ' have six - hour window ' to erase memories of fear
Memory fuels our fears
Humans have a six - hour window of opportunity when fearful memories can potentially be erased , a study says .
Reliving a harrowing memory opens what experts call a " reconsolidation window " - a time - limited period when it can be changed from bad to good .
A New York University team was able effectively to neutralise fearful memories by acting within six hours .
They hope their work , reported in Nature , will ultimately help those with disorders like post - traumatic stress .
Naturalistic approach
In the study , the volunteers were wired up to electrodes and given a shock each time they were shown a picture of differently coloured squares to make them fearful of the image - which they did .
A day later , the investigators worked on banishing the fear .
Our results suggest a non-pharmacological , naturalistic approach to more effectively manage emotional memories
Lead researcher Dr Elizabeth Phelps
They re-exposed the volunteers to the same image , but this time without the shocks .
They found that this worked , but only if the volunteer was first made to recall the fearful experience and , critically , made to recall it no longer than six hours before the " treatment " commenced .
Also , the treatment only blocked fear for the specific coloured square for which the fear memory was recalled , suggesting that the erasure is highly specific .
People need to realise it is the memory that is fearful and not the current reality
Professor Anke Ehlers Lead researcher Dr Elizabeth Phelps of New York University said : " Timing may have a more important role in the control of fear than previously appreciated .
" Our memory reflects our last retrieval of it rather than an exact account of the original event .
" Our results suggest a non-pharmacological , naturalistic approach to more effectively manage emotional memories . "
Professor Anke Ehlers , an expert in post traumatic stress disorder at London 's Institute of Psychiatry , said : " Talking about the traumatic memory can help .
That 's a common element of therapies .
" People need to realise it is the memory that is fearful and not the current reality . "

South Africa ’s Witwatersrand goldfields are around 95 % exhausted and production rates should fall permanently below 100 tonnes / year within the coming decade according to Dr Chris Hartnady , research and technical director of Cape Town earth sciences consultancy Umvoto Africa .
Dr Hartnady ’s findings , based on Chamber of Mines figures and mathematical modeling pioneered by the distinguished American geologist M. King Hubbert , have appeared in the latest edition of the SA Journal of Science .
The South African residual gold reserve after production through 2007 is only 2 948 tonnes , a little less than three times the 1970 production figure , and much less than 10 % of the officially cited reserve , says Hartnady .
The country ’s gold reserves are less than half of the current United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) estimate of 6 000 tonnes , and the country is not first , but fourth in world rankings , after Australia ( 5 000 tonnes ) , Peru ( 3 500 tonnes ) and Russia ( 3 000 tonnes ) , his research shows .
The USGS currently cites South Africa ’s gold reserves at around 6 000 tonnes , while SA claims a 36 000 tonnes reserve base figure ( or about 40 % of the global total ) .
After the first ( 1880s - 1910 ) and second stages ( 1911 - 1951 ) in the history of South African gold mining , there was “ a remarkable growth phase ” from an annual production rate of less than 400 tonnes in 1952 to over 950 tonnes in 1965 .
This period is associated with bringing new mines into production around the new goldfields of Carletonville , Klerksdorp , the Free State and Evander areas , and the introduction of innovative technologies for mining at ever deeper levels .
“ Given the energy and environmental problems associated with ongoing groundwater control , water - resource contamination by acid mine drainage and the possibility of widespread mercury and other factors of pollution caused by illicit underground ore - processing by the illegal miners , the glory days of South African gold mining appear to have arrived finally at an ignominious end .
“ There can be no further illusions , maintained by unrealistic expectation of a future fortune , about the seriousness of the present situation .
In their various possible forms , the slow - onset disasters of environmental degradation associated with the death - throes of a formerly illustrious industry now pose a serious threat , and may ultimately cost far more than the net present value of some 3 000 tonnes of gold , ” says Hartnady .
Posted by John , December 13th , 2009 - under Rum rebellion .
Tags : Alcohol , Australian politics , Grog
On Friday and Saturday night thousands of thugs took over inner city streets across Australia and New Zealand .
These hooligans harassed , locked up and arrested hundreds .
The police called it Operation Unite and claimed its aim was to curb drunken and violent behaviour in the early morning in known drinking spots .
We are , they pompously proclaimed , sending a message that such behaviour is not acceptable .
By ‘ such behaviour ’ the armed thugs of the State mean getting pissed .
Forget the violence smokescreen .
Almost all of those arrested or otherwise dealt with over the weekend were done for drunken behaviour , not fighting .
One of society ’s very messages is that getting pissed , especially at Christmas functions , is acceptable .
It is not only acceptable , it is almost mandated .
Image after image portrays having a glass in hand as the perfect way to relax , generally with friends .
Alcohol is an integral part of Australian , and indeed of most other Western countries ’ , culture .
In feudal times it was a way of celebrating the changing seasons on a particular day ( often disguised in religious garb ) and used as a release valve from the dull monotony for the peasantry of their lives .
Under capitalism alcohol became a commodity , with beer and rum for example mass produced for the great labouring classes .
Instead of celebrations every six or twelve months , the successful struggle for the shorter working week gave workers free time both after work and on Sundays and then weekends to escape from the alienation of capitalist society .
Alcohol and the fleeting end of work became entwined in the popular mind , and cheap rum production enabled a flowering of alcohol consumption .
Later on grew the great beer breweries who used the most modern methods of production to make cheap grog .
They found a ready audience for their wares .
It was at about the same time that the ruling class began to develop a special body of men to protect their property interests and the social relations which gave rise to them .
These police men ( and now women ) have powers of coercion not given to ordinary citizens .
To do this the state had to break down the community policing role ( already under way through the process of industrialisation ) .
In a colonial settler state like Australia the combination of its political and economic backwardness and harshness saw alcohol at the very centre of society .
For some time in the early days rum was a currency in the colony .
Although our first and only coup was named the Rum Rebellion , this was in fact a power struggle between the developing capitalist class and military and the political ruler and some of the newly freed convicts and settlers .
As capitalism became more and more established , a ‘ lawless ’ working class developed too .
Part of that lawlessness saw alcohol become part of the culture of the country , as well as what the ruling class perceived to be a work shy attitude .
The elite unleashed constant police drives against this rabble to force them into stable relationships and stop their licentious and drunken ways .
Operation Unite stands in that great tradition of social control , of attempting to enforce ruling class standards on young workers to conform to behaviours suitable for their ongoing exploitation as wage slaves .
When the working class establishes its own rule over society , it takes into its own hands the role of policing .
Every time it does this , crime rates drop markedly .
This is both because power is now in our hands and because the community is a much better policeman than the enforcers of capital .
So too does drunkenness drop .
Workers are high on their own power , and do n’t need to escape from their society .
Empowerment replaces grog .
Until such a society exists the left must stand with the oppressed and alienated against the State ’s agents of violence .

Sediment cores taken from a remote Arctic lake indicate that the ecosystem has changed dramatically in recent decades , according to a new study .
These shifts , which are unprecedented for the past 200,000 years , most likely result from human - induced climate change .
Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the authors explain that ecosystem changes as observed in sediment cores are tightly linked to changes in climate .
Until quite recently , natural influences , such as periodic shifts in Earth 's orbit , effected the changes .
But the ecosystem shifts they observe since 1950 indicate that something other than Earth 's wobbly orbit is changing the Arctic 's climate .
As another recent study pointed out , going strictly by orbital shifts , the Arctic should be cooling at present .
Earth is now 0.6 million miles farther from the sun during the northern hemisphere 's summer solstice than 2,000 years ago , and receives less of its energy .
And , in fact , the Arctic was gradually cooling for the past 2,000 years — until about 50 years ago when , despite the diminished solar energy reaching the northern hemisphere during summer , it abruptly began warming .
( Here 's a nice graphic of that trend and its abrupt reversal . )
And the Arctic lake ecosystem appears to have adjusted accordingly .
The authors of the PNAS study examined the relative abundances of midges and algae in the sediments of a lake on Baffin Island , which lies a few hundred miles west of Greenland .
For the past several thousand years , cold - adapted midge larvae have abounded in the lake .
Then came 1950 .
Since then , midge numbers have undergone a steep decline .
Two species have disappeared entirely .
In that same period , a lake alga species , which was relatively scarce before the 20th century , has increased in abundance .
The authors attribute this to less lake ice .
Without it , the photosynthetic alga has more access to sunlight .
This study comes on the heels of a several others documenting other ecosystem shifts in the Arctic .
A review last month in Science summed them up .
In the past 150 years , Earth 's average temperature has increased by about 0.4 C ( 0.72 F. ) .
But the Arctic has warmed two to three time as much .
As a result , spring arrives earlier and winter is less severe .
Some plants begin flowering 20 days earlier than previously .
Insects show up earlier .
Herbivorous insects , like the winter moth , have moved north , defoliating birch forests in parts of Scandinavia .
Red foxes have moved north into Arctic fox territory .
Some migrating caribou herds , meanwhile , find that their calving season is out of sync with the most nutritious forage , which now sprouts earlier .
These herds have declined .
Conversely , in some places , snow that now melts more often during winter permits caribou herds to access more food during cold months .
These herds have responded by growing in number .
Another recent study in the journal Ecological Monographs looked at the positive feedback potential of a warming Arctic .
Arctic land and sea together absorb and sequester up to one - quarter of the world 's carbon .
Much of that carbon is held in permafrost .
If the Arctic warms too much , it may not only stop absorbing carbon , it may begin emitting greenhouse gases , warming climate further .
Another recent bit of climate news has little to do with climate science directly or observations of shifting ecosystems .
Rather , it purports to measure Americans ' perception of climate change .
A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press released last week found that , compared to three years ago , fewer Americans believe there 's strong evidence that global warming is real .
In 2006 , 77 percent believed that global warming was real .
Now 57 percent do .
Andrew Kohut , director of the research center , attributed the decline to the economic downturn .
" The priority that people give to pollution and environmental concerns and a whole host of other issues is down because of the economy and because of the focus on other things , " he told The Associated Press .

We must begin this profile with a question :
Is there a more contemptible poseur than Wafa Sultan who calls herself an atheist but in the same breath also claims to be a Muslim reformer , which would kind of be like Christopher Hitchens calling himself a Christian reformer ?
It is difficult to answer that question with certainty considering the wide pool of bigots who combine charlatanism with raving and incorrigible insanity .
But for sure one thing is certain , she is completely undeserving of the 15 minutes of fame she has succeeded in procuring .
In this sense , Wafa Sultan falls into the same category as Walid Shoebat , Brigitte Gabriel , Nonie Darwish , Kamal Saleem , Zachariah Anani and other self - proclaimed turn coats from their Arab and Muslim identities .
As we mentioned before this group attempts to parlay their “ otherness , ” and so - called “ insider knowledge of the Muslim world , ” ( the “ I ’ve been there , I know ” line ) into a cash cow .
Meanwhile , we are supposed to be duped into freaking out and running back to them for more “ expert ” advice brought to us from our loyal friend who ventures into the other side on our behalf .
Sultan is no different , her tale of flight into Islamophobic stardom is a curious and thoroughly modern one .
In the beginning of this tale Sultan was invited onto a show hosted by the well known anchorman of AlJazeera ’s Opposing Viewpoints ( Ittijaah al - Mu’aakas ) , Faisal Al - Qasim for the purpose of a debate with professor Ibrahim al - Khouly from Al - Azhar on the topic of the Clash of Civilizations and the Clash of Religions .
Al - Qasim , brought her onto the show originally after noticing some of her articles on the Arabic website called AnNaqed ( The Critic ) .
The New York Times reported that the website was an Islamic reform site , but in actuality it turns out that it is a Christian website ,
[ T ]he web site called Annaqed ( www.annaqed.com) she supposedly wrote for before being noticed by Al - Jazeera Television is not an “ Islamic reform Web Site ” as was reported in the New York Times article , but rather an Arab nationalist blog run by a Syrian Christian who defines it as being “ in line with Christian morality and principles . ”
The site is also replete with anti-Muslim writings .
On the show she supported the thesis of a clash and stated that the conflict between the West and Islam is ,
a clash between a mentality that belongs to the Middle Ages and another that belongs to the 21st century … a clash between civilization and backwardness , between the civilized and the primitive , between barbarity and rationality .
MEMRI , ( Middle East Media Research Institute ) which peddles in biased , selective , de- contextualized , error - filled , and misleading translations of news , shows and opinion from Middle East television took the 45 minute show and per its modus operandi chopped up and edited the show into a 5 minute sound bite of Wafa Sultan ’s attack on Muslims and Islam .
In the process , and without any respect for translational integrity they also attempted to deceptively frame Professor Khouly as proclaiming Sultan a “ heretic , ” when , as this fully translated transcript shows he did no such thing .
Instead Khouly responded to Sultan ’s jibes with questions that though we might not agree to the way he frames them are far from irrational or undebatable ,
… here we must ask a question , who facilitated the conflict and indeed initiated it ; is it the Muslims ?
Muslims now are in a defensive position fighting off an aggressor … who said Muslims were backward ?
They may be backward in terms of technological advances , but who said that such are the criteria for humanity ?
That is just the beginning of the story , the MEMRI produced video was downloaded to YouTube where it went viral receiving over a million hits and like wild fire the anti-Muslim blogosphere picked it up .
Instantly , over night , Sultan was a star .
In this consumer age , MEMRI ’s rendition of the show gave the public what it wanted to see : a spectacle .
It fit in well with the narrative of an oppressed Mooslim woman “ finally ” standing up for her rights and taking on the world of Islam .
Sultan capitalized on the spotlight she had and with all the ingenuity and creativeness of a con-artist spun a tale which essentially boils down to her “ dark days growing up in the barbaric ‘ Islamic nation ’ of Syria . ”
A good example of her deception can be gleaned from a recent article she wrote for the neo-conservative website Hudson New York ,
As an Arab woman who suffered for three decades living under Islamic Sharia , it is clear to me that Islam ’s political ideology and Sharia must be fought relentlessly by Western civilization to prevent its application in a free society .
( emphasis added )
This encapsulates the opportunism that motivates Sultan and it also reveals the contempt with which she holds her readers whose intelligence she seeks to insult with such a blatant lie .
She attempts to paint her three decades in Syria as a nightmare in which she suffered the brutal force of a Taliban - esque regime that implemented Islamic law on her constantly .
The absurdity is only matched by the bravado of her claim , as anyone who cared to check ( Wikipidea for instance ) could tell you that the regime that ruled Syria had nothing to do with Islam .
The regime in Syria , during much of the time period that Sultan talks about was ruled by the secular , anti-Shariah Ba’athist dictator Hafiz al - Assad who happens to come from the same privileged sect that Sultan was born into : the Alawies .
Her allegation is even more obscene considering the fact that Hafiz al - Assad massacred 20,000 villagers in Hama , Syria who were members of the Muslim Brotherhood .
One has to ask Sultan , if you were made to suffer for thirty years under Islamic Sharia ’ , how could you , a woman , have finished your medicine degree at the University of Aleppo ?
On top of that , would an Islamic Sharia state as horrid as you describe have funded your education for free ?
Another good example of her tale of woe is the profile carried by self - described “ bad girl of Islam ” Asra Nomani in TIME magazine .
Asra Nomani , who ca n’t pen anything without including herself writes ,
I connected with her ( Sultan ’s ) anger and pain .
She questioned Islam in 1979 , when , she says , she witnessed the murder of a professor by men with alleged ties to the ultraconservative Muslim Brotherhood political group .
InFocus , a California based magazine did more thorough research into the matter than TIME in a piece titled One wonders if Nomani was so moved by her “ connection ” with Sultan that she ( and her editors ) forgot to fact check whether or not Sultan actually could have witnessed the murder of her professor in her classroom . , a California based magazine did more thorough research into the matter than TIME in a piece titled Wafa Sultan : Reformist or Opportunist
As to the claim that her professor ( thought to be Yusef Al - Yusef ) was gunned down before her eyes in a faculty classroom at the University of Aleppo , Halabi said the incident never took place .
“ There was a professor who was killed around 1979 , that is true , but it was off - campus and Sultan was not even around when it happened , ” he added .
InFocus contacted the University of Aleppo and spoke to Dr. Riyad Asfari , Dean of the Faculty of Medicine , who confirmed Halabi ’s account .
“ Yes , the assassination took place off - campus , ” he said .
Dr. Asfari was keen to add that no one had ever been killed in a classroom anytime or anywhere at the university .
Syrian expatriate Ghada Moezzin , who attended the University of Aleppo in 1979 as a sophomore , told InFocus that she never heard of the assassination .
“ We would ’ve known about the killing if it had happened , ” she said .
“ It would have been big news on campus and I do not recall ever hearing about it . ”
Moezzin , who lives in Glendora , Calif. , added that government security was always present around the university given the political climate in Syria at the time .
Half - truths and lies corroborate and reveal the true motive behind Sultan ’s hate and invective against Islam : money .
The article reveals more ,
Adnan Halabi* , a Syrian expatriate who met and got to know the Sultans when they first came to the United States , spoke at length about the Wafa Sultan that very few people know .
According to Halabi , Dr. Wafa Ahmad ( her maiden name ) arrived in California with her husband Moufid ( now changed to David ) in the late 80s on a tourist visa .
Contrary to what she told the New York Times , they came as a couple , leaving their two children back in Syria .
Another source named Nabil Mustafa , also Syrian , told InFocus that he was introduced to Moufid Sultan through a personal friend who knew the family well , and both ended up having tea at the Sultans ’ one - bedroom apartment one evening in 1989 .
It was then that Moufid told Mustafa the story of how he was reunited with his two children .
According to Mustafa , Moufid Sultan told him that a short time after they arrived in the country , his wife , Dr. Wafa Sultan , mailed her passport back to her sister Ilham Ahmad in Syria ( while the passport still carried a valid U.S. tourist visa ) .
With Ilham bearing a resemblance to her sister Wafa , the plan was to go to the Mexican Embassy in Damascus and obtain a visa to Mexico , making sure that the airline carrier they would book a flight on would have a layover somewhere in the Continental United States .
With an existing U.S. visa on Wafa Sultan ’s passport , Ilham Ahmad had no trouble obtaining an entry permit to Mexico .
Shortly after , Ilham and Wafa ’s two children landed in Houston , Texas .
She and the children then allegedly made their way through customs and were picked up by Moufid and brought to California .
Taking advantage of an amnesty law for farmers , the Sultans applied for permanent residency through a Mexican lady who worked as a farm hand .
She helped Moufid with the paperwork by claiming he had worked as a farmer for four years .
The application went through and the Sultans obtained their green cards .
As incredible as the story sounds , Mustafa told InFocus that to the best of his recollection , this was the exact account he heard from Moufid Sultan .
Halabi , who is not acquainted with Mustafa , corroborated the story , which he heard from Dr. Wafa Sultan herself but with fewer details .
Dr. Wafa Sultan declined InFocus ’ repeated requests to be interviewed or comment on the allegations .
InFocus contacted the Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) to check on the veracity of the story but an official said that they would look into the allegations , which could take months to investigate .
Halabi alleges that Ilham Ahmad lived as illegal resident with her sister Wafa for years until she met an Arab Christian named Khalid Musa Shihadeh whom she ended up marrying ( they were married in Nevada on 12/8/1991 and filed for divorce in 2002 ) .
It was during that time that Halabi got to know the Sultans well .
Halabi alleges that the Sultans lived in dire poverty .
“ Their rent was over $ 1,000 per month and Moufid was only making $ 800 , ” he said .
Dr. Wafa Sultan was forced to rent out a room in her apartment and work at a pizza parlor in Norwalk , Calif .
where a personal friend used to pick her up and drop her off daily .
This same friend used to help the Sultans out with groceries and occasionally loaned them money just so they could make it through the month .
“ It was a serious struggle , ” Halabi recalled .
“ The Sultans lived hand to mouth for years on end . ”
Further , Halabi said that at no point during the period he knew the family did Sultan ever discuss religion , politics or any topic relevant to her current activities .
“ She is a smart woman , articulate and forceful , but she never meddled in religion or politics to the extent she is doing now , ” Halabi said .
Sultan is not condemned only by Muslims , non-Muslims have come out and strongly condemned her as well .
Sultan ’s detractors include not only Muslims but members of the Jewish community as well .
In an op - ed piece published in the Los Angeles Times ( June 25 , 2006 ) and titled “ Islam ’s Ann Coulter , ” Rabbi Stephen Julius Stein at Wilshire Boulevard Temple , who attended a fundraiser for a local Jewish organization where Sultan was a speaker , wrote , “ The more Sultan talked , the more evident it became that progress in the Muslim world was not her interest … .
She never alluded to any healthy , peaceful Islamic alternative . ”
The rabbi mentioned that Judea Pearl , father of murdered journalist Daniel Pearl , “ was one of the few voices of restraint and nuance heard that afternoon .
In response to Sultan ’s assertion that the Koran contains only verses of evil and domination , Pearl said he understood the book also included ‘ verses of peace ’ that proponents of Islam uphold as the religion ’s true intent .
The Koran ’s verses on war and brutality , Pearl contended , were ‘ cultural baggage , ’ as are similar verses in the Torah . ”
He added , “ Sultan ’s over - the - top , indefensible remarks at the fundraiser , along with her failure to mention the important , continuing efforts of the Islamic Center ( of Southern California ) , insulted all Muslims and Jews in L.A. and throughout the nation who are trying to bridge the cultural gap between the two groups .
And that ’s one reason why I eventually walked out of the event . ”
The hope is that more and more people like Rabbi Stephen Stein will see Wafa Sultan for who she is : a hateful , opportunistic poseur .
The atheist who calls Islam and Muslims “ backward and primitive , ” “ incapable of reform , ” the Qur’an as only filled with “ evil , ” yet ca n’t see the self - contradiction in her befuddling statements that growing up in secular Syria she “ suffered from Islamic Shariah ” and “ I even do n’t believe in Islam , but I am a Muslim . ”
Go figure .
UPDATE : In retrospect , our piece on Wafa Sultan seems not to have been harsh enough on her hate .
In light of recent comments she has made while on her book tour at synagogues and churches , the poseur can properly be renamed , Wafa Stalin Sultan because the atheism that she believes in is propelled by the same genocidal and insane impulses that led another loon , Joseph Stalin .
Atlas Shrugs ( read : Pamela Geller on Drugs ) made our jobs easy by posting a video clip of Wafa Stalin Sultan going off the deep end .
In the video , Sultan is addressing a group at a synagogue in NYC and says ,
“ I believe King Abdullah can change Islam overnight , but you need to put pressure on him to do it , and the same kind of pressure you put on Japan , you might need it ” at that moment someone from the audience interjects and asks , “ atom bombs ? ” Wafa Sultan replies , “ Yes .
At some point the West will need to do it . ”
At the end of her speech , she utters something quite strange for an atheist , “ God bless you and God bless America . ”
More charlatanism ?
During the question and answer session she divides moderate Muslims into three categories : 1. ) a majority , 80 % who are unaware of the real teachings of Islam , 2 . ) huge chunks of them are practicing Taqiyyah , 3 . ) a very small progressive group who have no effect .
All talking points from the far right - wing wing .
The rest of the question and answer session is interesting as well , and pocked full of more and more lies from Wafa Stalin Sultan .
Check it out for yourselves .
This disgusting little woman continues with her fascist fearmongering , she says , “ Islam is infiltrating and you are doing nothing about it . ”
Someone from the audience then asks Sultan , “ How would we stop it from infiltrating ? ” Sultan replies , “ Get involved in politics , you have to know the kind of leaders you are choosing . ”
The man then says , “ If we got involved in politics , what would our platform be , what would we say ? ”
Sultan replies quoting Geert Wilders , “ Islam is not religion ! ”
The man interrupts and asks , “ what would our platform be , what would A , B and C be ? ” Sultan replies , “ the same you dealt with Nazism .
The same way , the same exact way .
The same way ! ”
To this she receives a big applause from the all too captive audience … ” you reversed the Japanese culture , the same , you might need to do it , you might need to do a heavy pressure , I cannot predict the kind of pressure , you understand it , I do n’t have to say it . ”
Quite chilling the way she nonchalantly advocates nuking Muslims .
Sultan also says , “ You know Geert Wilders has said if he becomes Prime Minister of Holland he will ban the Quran , I admire him for that . ”
The audiences glibly agrees with her with mutterings of “ yes . ”
If you want to see how fascism takes hold then watch the video .
My only question is how much are these synagogues and churches paying her for her speaking appearances ?
Enlarge Artist illustration by Jorge Gonzalez Tawa hallae , a newly unveiled Triassic , carnivorous dinosaur , " helps us reconstruct the origins of all the most primitive dinosaurs , suggesting they were likely located in South America , " says Sterling Nesbitt of the American Museum of Natural History .
Discovery of a primitive precursor to Tyrannosaurus Rex , some 215 million years old , points to a South American origin for dinosaurs , paleontologists reported Thursday .
In the journal Science , a team led by Sterling Nesbitt of the American Museum of Natural History in New York , unveils Tawa hallae , found in a fossil bone bed near New Mexico 's Ghost Ranch , made famous by the artist Georgia O'Keefe .
Nesbitt 's team named the creature , a 6.5 - foot - long meat - eating precursor to T. Rex , after a Pueblo sun god and the fossil collector Ruth Hall .
" Tawa helps us reconstruct the origins of all the most primitive dinosaurs , suggesting they were likely located in South America , " Nesbitt says .
The dinosaur , " probably ate anything he got his hands on , " he adds .
SCIENTISTS : New dinosaur species found in South Africa SCIENCE FAIR :
An experiment in science , space and discovery Tawa lived some 215 million years ago , when South America abutted North America and Africa on the super - continent Pangaea , since separated by the drift of the Earth 's crustal plates .
The fossils — two nearly complete skeletons and parts of six others — possess the claws , skull and bones of the first dinosaurs from about 230 million years ago found in South America .
The fossils fill in evolutionary gaps to later " theropods " , the two - legged , upright meat - eaters such as T. Rex , which lived about 80 to 65 million years ago , and today 's birds .
" We 've got to rewrite some chapters in textbooks , and I have to rewrite my next lecture " says paleontologist Thomas Holtz Jr. of the University of Maryland in College Park .
Holtz and some paleontologists had argued that some theropods originated in North America , but Tawa displays clear links to earlier South American ones and to later ones found in Europe , jammed against North America at that time , he now says .
" All carnivorous dinosaurs are relatives , this suggests , " he adds .
Tawa and other early dinosaurs spread through a world dominated by crocodilian reptiles of all shapes and sizes , including very large carnivores , Nesbitt says .
Only after the end of the Triassic era some 200 million years ago , a time of a major extinction among species , did dinosaurs flourish and grow to their massive size .
" Tawa would have looked like a very small T. Rex , " Nesbitt says , adding " no one would have guessed then , " that the theropods would later give rise to massive multi-ton killers millions of years later .
The Tawa finds all likely died in a flood that tangled their bones with other creatures .
The find also sheds light on origins of other dinosaur lines , the study says , including the " sauropods , " four - legged , long - necked , long - tailed plant - eaters , which do n't turn up in North America fossil beds from that era , but do in Europe .
Their rarity points to a South American origin for all dinosaurs , not just T. Rex 's lineage , Nesbitt says .
" Sauropods just avoided the tropics , " of then - North America , some 215 million years ago .

The US parents who triggered a major alert by claiming their six - year - old son was adrift in a helium balloon are to admit charges , their lawyer says .
Falcon
Heene 's mother , Mayumi , is to admit false reporting to authorities and his father Richard will admit attempting to influence a public servant .
Falcon 's disappearance became a media drama but he was later found at home .
Police accused the family of masterminding the 15 October incident as part of a publicity bid .
Rajesh Mirchandani reports .
The new rules have not gone down well with many countries India has tightened rules for long - term tourist visas , barring visitors from returning within two months of leaving .
Under previous rules , tourists on long - term visas had to leave the country every 180 days .
Many simply paid brief visits to neighbouring countries .
Some countries have protested against the new rules , with the US saying they are being applied inconsistently .
India 's move follows the arrest in the US of a man charged in connection with the 2008 Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks .
David Headley , a Pakistani American , is said to have travelled to India several times last year to help identify targets for the attacks , which left more than 170 people dead .
' Gaps ' India 's new regulations effectively also make it much harder for people to use long - term tourists visas to work in the country .
Prior guidance and procedures that allowed re-entry to India after stays of up to 180 days are no longer in effect
US embassy in Delhi
Your comments
The government has yet to formally announce or provide details of the new rules , but Home Minister P Chidambaram set out the case for tightening regulations on Tuesday .
" The gaps in the visa system have been exposed in a number of cases , the most notable among them being the case of David Headley .
The compelling need to create a fool - proof system cannot be overstated , " he said .
In a posting on its website , the US embassy in Delhi said the " new visa and registration regulations are being implemented inconsistently " .
" Travellers have reported being denied re-entry after exiting India for business or family emergencies , or for tourist travel to nearby countries , even if their initial visit to India was for only a few days , " the statement said .
Many tourists say the two - month gap is too long " The US mission has received confirmation that foreign passports are now stamped on exit to indicate that the bearer cannot re-enter India within two months of exit unless special permission is obtained from an Indian embassy , consulate , or high commission abroad , regardless of the validity of visa or length of stay in India . "
On Tuesday , visiting British Business Secretary Lord Mandelson raised the issue with Mr Chidambaram .
" I can understand the motive for the new visa arrangements but we have to be careful not to make , create general restrictions , " Lord Mandelson was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency .
" I think , for many tourists , a two - month gap is too big . "
A spokeswoman at the British High Commission in Delhi said : " There is no real clarity over the details of the proposals or how they might be implemented .
We understand that the Indian government is reconsidering its plans . "

Dec. 23 , 2009  -- Richard Heene and Mayumi Heene , the parents behind the balloon boy hoax , will soon float away to jail .
Today , Larimer County , Colo .
Judge Stephen Schapanski sentenced the couple behind one of the year 's biggest media stunts to a total of 110 days jail and eight years probation .
He also prohibited the couple from making any money off the balloon boy fiasco during that time .
Schapanski stated that Richard Heene must spend 30 days in jail beginning Jan. 11 , 2010 .
The remaining 60 days of his 90 - day sentence may be carried out under " work release , " meaning he can work during the day and spend nights in prison .
" This will be supervised probation , " Schapanski said about that part of the sentence .
" The terms and conditions will be that Mr. Heene is in fact prohibited from receiving any form of financial benefit -- whether it be media , a book , an article he writes -- anything of that kind that stems from this incident . "
The judge also ruled that Richard Heene must write a letter of apology to the community and public service agencies that were roped into the Oct. 15 stunt , perform 100 hours of community service and submit to random drug or alcohol testing .
Mayumi Heene , wife of Richard Heene and mother of 6 - year - old Falcon , who was thought to be in the homemade helium - powered balloon the day it swept over Colorado , received a similar sentence to her husband 's : 20 days jail time , to be served after Richard Heene completes his sentence , four years supervised probation , 120 hours community service , a mandatory letter of apology and a stipulation that she cannot profit from the fiasco for at least four years .
Many wanted jail time for the father of three .
In laying out his reasons why Richard Heene should get jail time , chief deputy district attorney Andrew Lewis told the court , " Mr. Heene wasted a lot of man power and a lot of money in wanting to get himself some publicity , " and added that the court should make an example of him .
" I think Jay Leno said it best when he said , ' This is a copycat game . '
And people will copycat this event .
They need to go to jail so people do n't do that , " Lewis said .
In his attempt to seek a lesser sentence , David Lane , Richard Heene 's attorney , invoked the example of Orson Welles , noting that the author did n't go to jail for convincing the world that it was being invaded by aliens in his 1938 " War of the Worlds " radio broadcast .
Richard
Heene himself said little during the process , only apologizing once more before Judge Schapanski handed down his sentence .
" I do want to reiterate that I 'm very , very sorry , " Richard Heene said , pausing before continuing , " and I want to apologize to all the rescue workers out there and the people that got involved in the community .
That 's it . "
Mayumi Heene , a Japanese citizen , was represented by her own lawyer who emphasized her lack of past criminal offenses and competence as a mother in his attempt to avoid jail time for his client .
She declined to make a statement before Judge Schapenski's sentencing .
Should the Heenes Face More Punishment Than Jail ?
At least one man believes Richard Heene should face harsher punishment than prison .
Bob Heffernan , a lead investigator in the case for the Larimer County Sheriff 's Office , said in a letter to the judge dated Nov. 30 that there should be limits on how the Heenes might profit from the Oct. 15 hoax , such as through book or TV deals .
" This would hopefully stop the Heenes from being able to exploit their criminal behavior or their children any more than they already have , " Heffernan wrote in the letter .
" All the while the Heenes were playing us all in hopes of making themselves more marketable . "
Last month , the Heenes pleaded guilty to charges that they carried out the balloon boy stunt in October to promote a reality TV show .
Richard Heene , 49 , pleaded guilty to a felony charge of attempting to influence a public servant .
Mayumi Heene , 48 , pleaded guilty to false reporting , a misdemeanor .
Lane said in a November statement that the parents accepted the plea deal rather than risk a trial in which Mayumi Heene , if found guilty , would face deportation to Japan .
" Upon reviewing the evidence , arguably , Mayumi could have possibly ended up being deported and Richard could have proceeded to trial and had a good chance at an acquittal , " Lane said .
" This , however , would have put the family at grave risk of seeing a loving , caring , compassionate wife and mother ripped from the family and deported .
That was not an acceptable risk , thus these pleas . "
Today 's sentence may not be the end of the family 's troubles .
The Heenes could still face federal fines and / or charges stemming from an ongoing civil investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration because their stunt caused some planes at the Denver airport to switch runways while the balloon was in flight .
Timeline of the Balloon Boy Blowup
The Heenes sparked a nationwide panic when they called 911 Oct. 15 to report that Falcon had climbed inside a saucer - shaped balloon that became untethered in the backyard of their Fort Collins home .
Local , state and federal authorities followed the runaway balloon while sheriffs fielded hundreds of phone calls with suggestions about how to get the boy safely to earth .
Accross the country , thousands of people watched as the balloon soared across the Colorado sky .
Soon after the balloon landed with no one aboard , the Heenes said they found Falcon hiding in the rafters of the family garage .
Within hours , celebration turned to suspicion when , during a CNN interview , the 6 - year - old Falcon said , " We did this for a show . "
The Heenes had twice been on the ABC reality TV series " Wife Swap . "
A former business partner told media outlets that Richard Heene had been in talks to create his own show and had likely launched the balloon as a publicity stunt .
Then , in separate interviews with police Oct. 17 , Mayumi Heene admitted the incident was a hoax , sparking child protective services to interview the children themselves .
The Heenes ' stunt rung up a hefty bill .
According to Lane , the Larimer County District Attorney 's Office estimates the total costs associated with the balloon boy fiasco at $ 46,000 .
That figure includes $ 8,000 in sheriff 's department overtime , $ 13,500 in deploying law enforcement from various Colorado counties , and $ 16,000 for the use of two National Guard helicopters , according to The Associated Press .
Though it only happened a few months ago , the hoax has gone down as one of the most memorable of the year , if not the decade , earning an ABC News " Bernie " nomination for 2009 's most eggregious wannabe star along with placement on scores of other " best of the worst " lists .
ABC News ' Russell Goldman contributed to this report .
The Israeli government ’s policy of blockade , which has been in place since mid-2007 , has made the rebuilding of thousands of homes , schools and hospitals an impossible task .
A report released today by leading humanitarian and human rights agencies including Christian Aid , Medical Aid for Palestinians and Oxfam International highlights the consequences of this policy .
This has meant that a mere 41 truckloads of construction materials in total have entered Gaza since the end of the military offensive .
With widespread destruction to the civilian infrastructure , these agencies have pointed out the obvious fact that the task of rebuilding and repairing thousands of homes alone will inevitably require thousands of truckloads of construction materials .
Father Jones said some people had little option but to turn to crime A priest from North Yorkshire has advised his congregation to shoplift if they find themselves in hard times .
The Reverend Tim Jones , the parish priest of St Lawrence and St Hilda in York , said people should steal from big chains rather than small businesses .
He said society 's attitude to those in need " leaves some people little option but crime " .
However the Archdeacon of York said : " The Church of England does not advise anyone to shoplift " .
North Yorkshire Police described the sermon as " highly irresponsible " .
' Catastrophic folly '
A force spokesman said despite people getting in difficult situations " shoplifting or committing other crimes should never be the solution " .
" To do this would make the downward spiral even more rapid , both on an individual basis and on society as a whole , " he said .
I would ask that they do not steal from small , family businesses , but from national businesses , knowing that the costs are ultimately passed on to the rest of us in the form of higher prices
Father Tim Jones Speaking to his congregation on Sunday , Father Jones said : " My advice , as a Christian priest , is to shoplift .
" I do not offer such advice because I think that stealing is a good thing , or because I think it is harmless , for it is neither .
" I would ask that they do not steal from small , family businesses , but from national businesses , knowing that the costs are ultimately passed on to the rest of us in the form of higher prices .
" When people are released from prison , or find themselves suddenly without work or family support , then to leave them for weeks and weeks with inadequate or clumsy social support is monumental , catastrophic folly .
" We create a situation which leaves some people little option but crime . "
' Important issues ' Speaking later on BBC Radio York , Father Jones said his intention had not been to rally people to shoplifting , but to encourage people to give more to charity to avoid those in need from becoming so desperate .
" If one has exhausted every legal opportunity to get money and you 're still in a desperate situation it is a better moral thing to do to take absolutely no more than you need for no longer than you need , " he said .
However the Archdeacon of York , the Venerable Richard Seed , said : " Father Tim Jones is raising important issues about the difficulties people face when benefits are not forthcoming , but shoplifting is not the way to overcome these difficulties . "
Father Jones made the news in May 2008 when he made a protest about Playboy branded stationery being aimed at children .
He went into a local stationers and threw the Playboy merchandise on the floor .

How about a little Advent ?
Advent
Many of us Christians wring our hands over the ongoing secularization and commercialization of Christmas .
We write letters to the editors of our local papers , we wear T - shirts or bumper stickers declaring the real “ reason for the season , ” and we even contact our elected representatives .
For some reason we think we can stem the tide of secularization by explicitly eliminating the process amidst our government , as if to suggest the government is the litmus test for our cultural - religious morality whether it be in the expression of huge government social programs or if the tree in the White House is referred to as a “ Christmas ” Tree or a “ Holiday ” Tree .
I find myself weary of the process ... to some degree it is just another front of the culture war that I used to be willing to fight but will not anymore .
In fact , I will protest against that war by suggesting both sides invest too much in government and that if they would STOP doing that no one would care what President Obama chooses to call the tree in his White House .
For all I care he can call it “ Spanky the Light Conifer ! ”
But seriously , here 's a thought for all of us Christians worried about the secularization and commercialization of Christmas : Do n't secularize and commercialize YOUR Christmas .
One simple ( though not easy ) way you can accomplish this is to participate in Advent and the traditional 12 days of Christmas .
“ Spanky the Light - Holiday ” may begin On November 1st , but despite what you may be witnessing at the City Hall , the WalMart , or the Home Depot , Christmas does n't actually begin until December 25th !
I know that 's hard to believe , but it 's true .
Additionally Christmas is not something that lasts a single day !
It does not simply end after a furious unwrapping of gifts , a trash run for Dad , and a meal .
It ’s supposed to last for TWELVE DAYS !
How cool is that !
( Addendum : As Fr. C notes in the comments : for the Orthodox the Feast of Christmas lasts through the 31st of December , not up until Epiphany / Theophany as in the Western Church .
So you westerners get 12 , we get 7 days ... figures ! )
Advent , which begins shortly ( November 15th for Orthodox Christians ) , has always in the past been a time for Christians to prepare - NOT by shopping or cooking but by personal discipline : fasting prayer , and almsgiving .
Christians of all breeds , I think , need to return to this venerable tradition – especially if they bemoan what has become of Christmas in America .
Now , let me shut up , and leave you with these words from an unusual source .
Maria Von Trapp , after she and her famous singing family escaped the Nazis and landed in America , was taken aback by the lack of Advent in America .
I remind you that this would have been in the 1940's .
From “ Around the Year with the Trapp Family :
The events that come to mind when we say " Christmas , " " Easter , " " Pentecost , " are so tremendous that their commemoration cannot be celebrated in a single day each .
Weeks are needed .
First , weeks of preparation , of becoming attuned in body and soul , and then weeks of celebration .
This goes back to an age when people still had time -- time to live , time to enjoy .
In our own day , we face the puzzling fact that the more time - saving gadgets we invent , the more new buttons to push in order to " save hours of work " -- the less time we actually have .
We have no more time to read books ; we can only afford digests .
We have no time to walk a quarter of a mile ; we have to hop into a car .
We have no time to make things by hand ; we buy them ready made in the five - and - ten or in the supermarket .
This atmosphere of " hurry up , let 's go " does not provide the necessary leisure in which to anticipate and celebrate a feast .
But as soon as people stop celebrating they really do not live any more -- they are being lived , as it were .
The alarming question arises : what is being done with all the time that is constantly being saved ?
We invent more machines and more gadgets , which will relieve us more and more from the work formerly done by our hands , our feet , our brain , and which will carry us in feverishly increasing speed -- where ?
Perhaps to the moon and other planets , but more probably to our final destruction .
Only the Church throws light onto the gloomy prospects of modern man--Holy Mother Church - - for she belongs , herself , to a realm that has its past and present in Time , but its future in the World Without End .
It was fall when we arrived in the United States .
The first weeks passed rapidly , filled with new discoveries every day , and soon we came across a beautiful feast , which we had never celebrated before : Thanksgiving Day , an exclusively American feast .
With great enthusiasm we included it in the calendar of our family feasts .
Who can describe our astonishment , however , when a few days after our first Thanksgiving Day we heard from a loudspeaker in a large department store the unmistakable melody of " Silent Night " !
Upon our excited inquiry , someone said , rather surprised : " What is the matter ?
Nothing is the matter .
Time for Christmas shopping ! "
It took several Christmas seasons before we understood the connection between Christmas shopping and " Silent Night " and the other carols blaring from loudspeakers in these pre-Christmas weeks .
And even now that we do understand , it still disturbs us greatly .
These weeks before Christmas , known as the weeks of Advent , are meant to be spent in expectation and waiting .
This is the season for Advent songs -- those age - old hymns of longing and waiting ; " Silent Night " should be sung for the first time on Christmas Eve .
We found that hardly anybody knows any Advent songs .
And we were startled by something else soon after Christmas , Christmas trees and decorations vanish from the show windows to be replaced by New Year 's advertisements .
On our concert trips across the country we also saw that the lighted Christmas trees disappear from homes and front yards and no one thinks to sing a carol as late as January 2nd .
This was all very strange to us , for we were used to the old - world Christmas , which was altogether different but which we determined to celebrate now in our new country .

Washington ( CNN ) -- Gregg Keesling chooses his words carefully when he talks about the death of his son , Spc. Chancellor Keesling .
As far as he 's concerned , the soldier did n't " take his own life " or " commit suicide . "
His son " died by suicide , " Keesling insists -- and he has his reasons why .
When 25 - year old Chancellor Keesling shot himself in Iraq on June 19 , his family received much support from the military and local officials .
Gregg Keesling 's son was given the honor afforded to a fallen service member .
The Keesling family went to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to watch as his body was flown back to Indiana six days later .
At his burial , seven rifles fired three times each , in true military tradition .
Later , the soldier 's aunt created a memorial wall in the family 's Indianapolis living room .
On the wall hangs Spc. Keesling 's uniform , the U.S. flag that was handed to his mother , Jannett , after the service and the Indianapolis flag that flew over the state Capitol in his honor .
Yet there 's an empty spot on the wall for an honor that never arrived : a letter from the president .
Gregg Keesling wanted to know why , especially after hearing President Obama talk about how he struggled to write letters to the families of each and every soldier killed in the war .
After pressing for an answer , the family found out the truth :
There would be no condolence letter .
It 's a matter of policy dating to the Clinton era , according to the White House .
The commander in chief sends such letters to the families of troops who have died in combat , but not if they committed suicide , Gregg was told .
The policy felt wrong to Gregg and Jannett Keesling .
Their son was a hero , and his country should be proud of him , they said .
So Gregg Keesling wrote to Obama and Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , imploring them to rethink the policy .
" The recognition of the president could have profound impact on the family of the suicide victim , " Keesling wrote in August .
Read the letters to President Obama
" The lack of acknowledgment and condolences from the President , who our family admires greatly , leaves us with an emotional vacuum and a feeling that we his family have somehow [ made ] less of a sacrifice , " he wrote in another letter to Casey .
A White House spokesman said the administration is reviewing the " inherited " policy .
" The President 's thoughts and prayers are with every military family who has lost a loved one in service to our country .
As Commander - in - Chief , he has worked with Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen to address the mental health needs of our service members , " spokesman Tommy Vietor wrote in an e-mail .
Spc. Keesling completed two tours of duty in Iraq .
When he enlisted in 2003 , the family struggled with his decision .
But the young soldier was convinced that he made the right decision , telling his family , " We must have a military , and somebody 's got to be in it . "
Before he deployed 2005 , he was anxious but excited , his mother remembered .
However , toward the end of his deployment , the stress of a failing marriage and the shock of war " began to wear on him terribly , " Gregg Keesling said .
In anger , he threw his wedding ring into the Tigris River , his parents said .
He was put under suicide watch , and his ammunition was taken away for several days .
At home , though , he was " back to his old self , " his father said , adding that his son found a job at FedEx and a new girlfriend .
He was treated at the Veterans Affairs clinic for a shoulder injury and burn he suffered during his deployment .
His parents assumed he was being treated for everything he needed .
In 2009 , he received new deployment orders .
His family suggested that he move to his mother 's native Jamaica to avoid service , but the soldier insisted that it was his obligation to see it through , his parents said .
When Keesling deployed again , this time as a reservist , he was n't with his original comrades .
Instead , he and 10 other Indiana reserves shipped off with a 300 - member unit from Tennessee , with just two months of training together .
His mental health records were not passed on either , leaving Spc. Keesling to share his past problems with his unit if he so chose .
He never did .
" I understand that , but it is a very big burden to put on a soldier to self - identify , " Gregg Keesling said .
In e-mails to his family , Spc. Keesling wrote about how distant he felt from his new brothers in arms .
" I hate going to war with people I do n't know , " he said to his father .
Gregg Keesling said his son struggled with members of his unit who joked about troops who committed suicide , oblivious to his struggles .
It became too much to bear .
After a long - distance fight with his girlfriend , the soldier said in an e-mail that he wanted to shoot himself .
After several phone calls , Spc. Keesling told his mother that he would talk to the Army chaplain .
He never did .
Instead , 12 hours after that e-mail , he went into a latrine and shot himself .
The family believes that his suicide was brought on by the stress of war and the distance from loved ones .
To them , it is death by injury like any other incident .
" He died by suicide , " Gregg said .
" He just had an injury that we just did not recognize . "
And that 's why they want a letter from the president .
" We do n't want to force the president to write a letter of condolence .
We hope he would want to , " Gregg said .
" We hope the president of the United States would want to show the appreciation to a family like ours for the sacrifice we made in allowing our son to become a soldier and defend his country . "
The blob bot uses a jamming mechanism to change its shape and roll , enabling it to squeeze into small spaces .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- iRobot 's latest robot is unique on many levels .
The doughy blob moves by inflating and deflating - a new technique its developers call " jamming . "
As the researchers explain in the video below , the jamming mechanism enables the robot to transition from a liquid - like to a solid - like state .
Earlier this week , researchers from iRobot and the University of Chicago presented the new " blob bot " at the IEEE / RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems .
As a new kind of chemical robot ( or chembot ) , the blob bot has stretchy silicone skin , which is composed of multiple cellular compartments that each contain a " jammable slurry . "
When some of these cells are unjammed , and an actuator in the center of the robot is inflated , the robot inflates in the areas of the unjammed cells .
By controlling which cells are unjammed , the researchers can change the shape of the robot and make it roll in a specific direction .
The new robot is being funded by DARPA , which gave iRobot $ 3.3 million to work on the chembot last year .
The goal is to build a robot that can squeeze through tiny openings smaller than its own dimensions , which could be valuable in a variety of missions .
The video shows the robot from about one year ago , and since then the researchers have been working on adding sensors and connecting multiple blob bots together .

“ Ouch ! ” “ Oooh ! ” “ Oww ! ” “ Omigod , that hurts ! ”
Those grunts of pain and anguish were n’t coming from us -- a group of 10 people running barefoot on a concrete pathway at Central Park in Huntington Beach early one recent Saturday morning .
They were being emitted by a grimacing group of shoe - wearing , dog - walking women who were staring at us as we passed .
But surprisingly , it did n’t hurt to run in bare feet .
In fact , it felt great .
Every step of our 30 - minute barefoot run was pure pleasure -- far more natural and comfortable than a run in shoes .
My forefeet led the way , lightly and smoothly mapping the terrain instead of thunking to the ground heels - first .
My air - cooled toes automatically spread wide instead of being smushed together .
And my body , without even trying , seemed to instinctively run “ softly ” -- knees slightly bent , legs crouched , absorbing shock like a spring .
My right knee , tender on runs since undergoing meniscus surgery a couple of months before , did n’t feel a thing .
On top of all that , I found myself wrapped in a childlike joy that was almost addictive .
Advertisement
“ That ’s a pretty common reaction , ” says Ken Bob Saxton , 54 , the affable , long - haired , thick - bearded organizer of this barefoot - running workshop and guru of a small but rapidly growing movement .
“ It ’s like your feet are suddenly free -- like they are getting out of prison .
And they are : your shoes . ”
Barefoot Ken , as he is known ( all accomplished barefooters routinely use “ barefoot ” before their names ) , hates shoes .
He never wears them , even at his computer technician job at Cal State Long Beach .
He says they desensitize the feet , encourage them to land heel first ; and just generally cause blunt shock and imbalances that chafe skin and wreck knee and hip joints .
Because shoes insulate wearers from real biofeedback , he says , they limit the ability to listen to one ’s body , leading to overuse injuries .
He dumped his shoes after the 1987 Long Beach Marathon , his first 26.2 - mile race .
It left his feet so blistered that he quit marathons for a decade .
“ I got tired of wearing out shoes , and shoes wearing out my feet , ” he says .
“ I was desperate .
Since I ’d always enjoyed running barefoot on the beach , I finally tried it on the pavement . ”

That experiment changed his life , ultimately establishing barefooting as a potential cure for some running injuries , implicating modern cushioned shoes in those injuries , and becoming the impetus for what may be the most counter - intuitive product in the history of sport : the barefoot running shoe .
Of course , Saxton is n’t the first person to run barefoot .
Ethiopia ’s Abebe Bikila won the 1960 Olympic marathon shoeless .
South Africa ’s Zola Budd was a barefoot sensation in the 1980s .
Coaches from high school through Olympic level have used barefoot drills for decades to strengthen athletes ’ feet .
But Saxton took it to a new level .
Since 2002 , he ’s averaged 10 shoeless marathons a year , running fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon twice and earn profiles in a spate of publications including Runner ’s World .
More important , he started a website , Running Barefoot ( runningbarefoot.org ) , that has become the leading information center on everything shoeless and a window of hope for injured runners desperate to keep it going .
Injury factor

Injuries decimate runners .
Studies indicate that about half of all runners are injured every year .
The London - based Sports Injury Bulletin puts it at 60 % to 65 % .
The cause ?
“ The heel strike , ” says Santa Monica physical therapist Robert Forster , who provides videotaped running - form analysis at his training facility , Phase IV .
“ During running , you land with an impact of five times your body weight .
When you land on your heel , the shock goes right into your joints .
To lessen the shock , you have to land ‘ softer ’ -- and that means on your forefoot or midfoot with a bent leg , not on your heel with a straighter leg . ”
A 2004 study by Dr. Timothy Noakes in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise found that the forefoot landing inherent in barefooting ( in which heel - striking is painful and unnatural ) transmitted up to 50 % less shock through the knees than heel - to - toe landings .
Six of the 10 people who showed up at Saxton ’s barefoot running clinic were motivated by injury reduction .
Chris Yamasaki , 29 , a real estate agent and one - year runner from Montebello who was suffering from shin splints , found out about Saxton ’s website from a Runner ’s World forum .
“ Now , I feel so good that I ’m training to do a 10 K barefoot , ” he said two weeks after the clinic .
Advertisement
John Fretwell , a 47 - year - old Mission Viejo administrator who had been having trouble with his left knee since he started running 18 months ago , said the pain was almost gone after eight 5 - mile barefoot runs .
Mike Rose , 57 , a retired naval officer from San Diego who has been running since 1986 , says : “ I think barefooting will help me last a few more decades . ”
Three years ago , after he discovered the website of Missouri ’s Barefoot Rick and then linked to Saxton ’s larger site , Rose began barefooting in order to toughen his feet and cure his recurrent knee pain and soreness .
He ’s now a committed barefooter with two unshod 10Ks on his race resume .
He woke up at 5 a .m. to make it to the 7 a.m. clinic so he could pick up some tips for his upcoming first barefoot marathon , Huntington Beach ’s Surf City , which was deliberately selected “ because it ’s Ken ’s home turf . ”
Rose says the trip was worth it ; he immediately picked up his speed , having learned to lift his toes on the landing , track his feet in a straighter line , and maintain a vertical arm swing .

Though barefooters initially run more slowly than they did in shoes -- the body has to accommodate to the new forefoot form and pay more attention to the ground to avoid rocks and other obstacles until the soles toughen up -- barefoot feet can be quite fleet .
“ Barefooting does not compromise performance , ” says Caltech doctoral student and clinic participant Julian Romero , a.k.a. Barefoot Julian , 26 .
“ There ’s less weight -- no shoes -- less friction , better heat management and automatically better form . ”
Proof : Among his 11 barefoot marathons was a second place finish at this year ’s Duke City Marathon in Albuquerque in a time of 2 hours , 47 minutes .
And the winner ?
Romero ’s 24 - year - old brother , Barefoot Alex , also a Caltech doctoral student , who finished in 2:40 in his second barefoot marathon .
“ I like being a role model for barefooting , but for the right reasons , ” said Alex Romero , an evolutionary biologist .
“ Not to be a freak , but because it ’s good for you .
Humans evolved to run barefoot over millions of years .
In 20 years , we have not adapted to these huge , cushioned running shoes that cause us to underuse our calves and all the muscles in our feet . ”
In 2005 , after he got a stress fracture in his tibia while on the college track team , he read an article about Saxton and mentioned it to his brother .
Advertisement
Injury - free Julian -- needing a break from his dissertation research in microeconomic game theory -- started barefooting first , intellectually intrigued by its less - is - more benefits .
After just three months of running unshod , an unusually rapid adaptation period for today ’s artificially shortened calves and Achilles tendons , he completed the 2006 Las Vegas Marathon .
“ One bad thing about barefooting in Vegas that day was all the attention ; I did n’t like it , ” says the now 7,000 - mile barefooter .
“ But on the plus side , I met Barefoot Ken at the finish . ”
‘ Barefoot shoes ’
All barefoot roads seem to lead through Saxton , regularly referred to as “ the guru ” or “ the godfather . ”
But now even he is being eclipsed in barefooting circles , some say , by a force he helped nourish : Barefoot Ted McDonald -- the hilarious , stream - of - consciousness ultra-running barefooter profiled in Christopher McDougall ’s 2009 bestseller “ Born to Run . ”
Advertisement
“ I get thousands of e-mails from around the world now , ” says McDonald , 45 , who could n’t run for longer than an hour without pain until he visited Saxton ’s site six years ago and began barefooting .
Last fall , banking on his growing fame and a tsunami of publicity from “ Born to Run , ” McDonald left his family ’s Pasadena carousel business for Seattle , where he is now a full - time coach and motivational speaker .
“ Ken and I are buddies , but he ’s too dogmatic , ” relative newcomer McDonald says .
“ He ’s why barefooting for too long appeared to be eccentric and not more mainstream .
He says your foot is enough .
But it ’s not . ”
McDonald is referring to the Vibram FiveFingers , the individual - toed “ barefoot shoes ” that he wears almost every time he runs .
The non-padded , virtual second skin of 2 - millimeter rubber is made by the renowned Milan , Italy - based maker of rubber hiking boot soles and has become a sold - out sensation among barefoot and shod runners .
They were introduced by Vibram in 2006 as water shoes for kayaking and sailing , but became a hit with runners seeking the benefits of barefooting with protection from rocks , glass and twigs .
Running stores are scrambling to get FiveFingers , which come in various models , including a trail shoe , but Vibram is so swamped that it is supplying only a few L.A. area stores .
Advertisement
“ Five Fingers started taking off last summer , and went through the roof in June , after the word about them got out and ‘ Born to Run ’ gave them validity , ” says Thac Lecong , the footwear buyer at FrontRunners .
The Brentwood running store was the first in the region to carry FiveFingers .
“ At the end of 2007 , when Vibram tried to convince me that barefooting strengthened feet and muscles , I knew it made physiological sense .
But they were so strange - looking , ” Lecong says .
“ Now , I look like a genius for taking a chance on the order .
Everyone wants them -- runners , water people , gym - goers , yoga .
Some even want them just because they ’re cool .
But I ’ve been in the business 17 years ; this is not just a fad .
There is a broad - based interest in the benefits it conveys . ”
The mad - scramble success of the FiveFingers -- Vibram has a patent on the individual - toe design -- has unleashed a gusher of minimalist shoes .
Finland ’s limited - distribution FeelMax is rushing out new models .
Nike is reportedly expanding on its minimalist Free line .
The buzz on Skora , a shoe set to debut in spring , is so hot that owner David Sypniewski , a Canadian who moved to Florida to launch the brand after he “ discovered the joy of running through Ken ’s site , ” already has been interviewed by numerous running magazines .

This rush to “ barefoot shoes ” rolls the eyes of Saxton , who a decade ago , as the newsletter editor of the Snail ’s Pace Running Club in Orange County , irritated people by continually writing about barefooting .
“ Anything you put between your feet and the ground desensitizes and weakens your feet , ” he says .
“ And if you do n’t learn how to run barefoot correctly to start with , you ’ll eventually have problems with Vibrams . ”
Which is why he did not allow them at the Saturday workshop .

JUST IN time for the holidays , administrators at Southern Illinois University ( SIU ) announced last week that they may not make the December payroll .
SIU President Glenn Poshard threatened that without additional state funding , the university would have to resort to layoffs and furloughs to make up the shortfall .
By the weekend , Poshard had backtracked -- claiming that SIU could make its payroll through mid-December with a huge squeeze on other expenditures .
This would still put SIU on track for a full - blown crisis early next year .
These threats come on the heels of the successful graduate employees strike at the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign ( UIUC ) -- and a month after pressure forced the state to back down from cutting Monetary Award Program ( MAP ) financial aid for the spring semester .
As the recession hits state budgets hard , college administrators think they have a green light to raise tuition , cut programs and lay off employees .
This is especially the case at SIU , where faculty and graduate assistants ' contracts are coming up for negotiation next summer .
Southern Illinois University President Glenn Poshard
According to SIU 's Graduate Assistants United ( GA United ) President Jim Podesva , " What they are trying to do is prepare people mentally , establishing a climate where bargaining units that ask for things are going to be discouraged from doing so .
Essentially , they are trying to create diminished expectations . "
Professor Tony Williams agrees .
" At the general level , [ the cuts are ] a way of attacking higher education , raising tuition and making it the preserve of just the wealthy elite , " he said .
" Poshard has been threatening cutbacks and layoffs for the past year .
I believe he 's trying to start a climate of fear on campus . "
WHILE ADMINISTRATORS are cynically manipulating the crisis , the budget disaster is real .
Because states can't run budget deficits -- and because revenue has been straitjacketed by years of free - market " reforms " -- things are set to get worse .
Illinois relies on a flat income tax rate and regressive sales taxes that not only put the burden largely on working people , but guarantee declining revenue as unemployment spreads in the wake of the recession .
Illinois is already $ 4 billion behind in paying bills for this year -- and that does n't include a short - term $ 2.2 billion loan that has to be paid back in the spring , or nearly $ 2 billion in cuts that have already been implemented .
Projections put the state $ 11.7 billion in the red for the coming year .
The crisis in education funding has deep roots .
In recent decades , state money had already plummeted as a total percentage of university and college budgets .
At SIU - Carbondale , annual tuition and fees more than doubled in just 10 years to over $ 10,000 .
Similarly , tuition hikes occurred at other state schools -- shifting the burden of education costs onto working - class and low - income students and their families .
This slow - burning funding crisis has now morphed into immediate disaster .
The state of Illinois has simply stopped sending hundreds of millions of dollars in already allocated funds to its colleges and universities .
The state owes U of I more than $ 300 million , and SIU some $ 125 million .
This shortfall could essentially cancel out the victory that students , faculty and staff won earlier in the semester to restore MAP funding following rallies on campuses and in the state capital .
Moreover , it 's no longer clear that Illinois will come up with the $ 200 million needed to fund MAP in the spring .
One in four students at SIU ( and nearly 150,000 statewide ) rely on MAP funds .
In the interim , SIU has ordered a freeze on all non-payroll expenditures and a near total hiring freeze ( although the school did find the money to hire a new chancellor ) .
Departments can't even buy replacement equipment without approval from top administration hacks -- and President Poshard ordered departments to " delay " paying their bills .
Poshard and SIU 's Vice President of Financial Affairs Duane Stucky claim these impromptu cutbacks have generated $ 25 million -- enough to make payroll through mid-December .
However , these cuts are intolerable to students , faculty and staff -- and wo n't solve the underlying problem .
As Williams put it , the cutbacks are making " teaching and research virtually impossible . "
Moreover , if the administration decides to pursue " emergency " layoffs and furloughs they will find themselves in violation of union contracts with faculty , staff and graduate employees .
" We 're operating under a contract , and it 's good until June or July 2010 , " said Podesva .
" If we 're operating under a contract and they start cutting paychecks , there are going to be issues . "
WHILE POSHARD and other administrators demand sacrifice from faculty , students and staff , they 're doing nothing about cutting their own bloated six - figure salaries and pet projects .
For example , more than $ 4 million in student fees are currently allocated for the new " Saluki Way " stadium development project at SIU .
According to the budget for the 2010 fiscal year , $ 35 million is set to be wasted on this boondoggle .
Administrative costs are also out of control .
SIU 's " Office of the President " alone has an annual budget of more than $ 2 million .
Scrapping unnecessary projects and cutting obese administrative salaries and expenses could go a long way to mitigating and possibly even solving the immediate crisis .
Meanwhile , faculty and staff are chronically underpaid .
As Williams argued , " The average wage [ for professors at SIU ] is 20 percent below what is paid elsewhere . "
At the state level , the Democratic Party majority in Springfield seems paralyzed -- trapped between their fidelity to big business and the enormity of the crisis .
Legislators do n't necessarily want to raise taxes on working - class voters during the recession -- or dramatically increase tuition costs ( all at once at any rate ) - - for fear that they might be punished in the next election .
At the same time -- and far more important for Springfield politicians -- they do n't want to alienate the corporations that run the state ( and fund their campaigns ) by raising taxes on big business and the rich .
Which side wins out depends on pressure from below .
This helps explain why legislators voted to restore MAP funding -- but failed to really fund it by earmarking any actual revenue -- back in October .
Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn has proposed taking out a $ 900 million emergency loan to cover the immediate shortfall .
However , this would only postpone the crisis by a few months at best .
The funding gap would reappear in the spring semester , and the state would then be forced to hand over our tax and tuition dollars to the banks -- with interest .
Quinn claims he wants to increase taxes during the spring legislative session to solve the problem once and for all -- but left to their own devices , Democrats in Springfield could easily come up with a rotten " compromise . "
According to the UIUC - based Institute of Government and Public Affairs , the " best solution " would be to raise taxes ( probably across the board ) and implement a new regime of ( essentially regressive ) sales taxes on things like plumbing repairs , haircuts and other services .
Many students and university workers might feel compelled to agree , but calling for regressive tax increases will ultimately serve to pit students and university workers against off - campus workers .
The only solution to the state budget crisis that helps all working - class Illinoisans as well as students and university employees is to demand a progressive graduated income tax .
So far , only a handful of politicians have proposed such a solution .
That would mean throwing out the state 's flat tax and the reliance on sales taxes , reducing ( instead of increasing ) tuition and fees while increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthy .
The way to put that kind of solution on the table is to build grassroots pressure .
We should follow the lead of the UIUC graduate students , the students who protested the MAP cuts earlier this fall and the thousands of students and workers who are protesting the massive tuition hikes and budget cuts in California .
Organizing against any current and coming budget cuts will mean protests -- and if necessary strikes and sit-ins .
Students and campus workers have the power to stop tuition hikes , layoffs and cuts .
Without them , the university system simply cannot run .
As Podesva put it , " We teach the core curriculum , we run the labs , we run the discussion sections , we prepare lectures , and we deliver the lectures .
This university would be shut down without graduate students . "
Nordic men and women are the most beautiful in the world .
That shows a survey by the online dating site Beautifulpeople.com .
Beautifulpeople.com is a bit different than other dating sites .
To become a member they require that you are physically attractive and good - looking .
Might seem shallow and mean to some , some might think .
But not when it comes to people from Scandinavia .
The list of presumed people is mainly topped by a great number of Scandinavian men and women .
No less than 65 percent of all the Swedish men who applied for membership were presumed .
The number is higher than among any other group , and Sweden takes the first place among guys .
Russia only have nine percent of men who were presumed .
Great Britain comes marginally better with 12 percent .
Among women , the Swedish girls comes in second place with 68 percent presumed .
But silver is not so bad when you read about the group who takes the gold , namely our ethnic neighbors in the West : Norwegians !
The Norwegian woman is so attractive that 76 percent of the other members want to see more of her .
But that 's not all .
On the women 's side , the Nordics makes a hat trick and brings home even the third place when Iceland is at 66 percent .
At the bottom of the placements , you find men and women from countries like South Korea , Lithuania , Russia and Poland .
Beautifulpeople.com was founded in Denmark and since its inception , almost two million people have been rejected on the grounds that their appearance does not meet the criterias .
The website has four million visitors each day .
" It may be morally ugly to our critics , but our growing success is a beautiful truth , " writes Greg Hodge , chief of the site , in a press release .

Just as we feared , the latest update to Snow Leopard , version 10.6.2 , drops support for the Intel Atom processor .
This means that anyone with a “ hackintosh ” who tries to update to the latest operating system version will see their computer die , going no further than the gray Apple logo on startup .
The reports are lighting up various hackintosh forums , and OSx86 - co- author wizard Stellarolla sums it up thusly :
Well , looks like I was right , again .
The netbook forums are now blowing up with problems of 10.6.2 instant rebooting their Atom - based netbooks .
My sources tell me that every time a netbook user installs 10.6.2 an Apple employee gets their wings .
It should n’t be long before some clever hacker figures out a workaround and releases a patched kernel to the world , re-enabling the OS on Atom - based computers .
But that 's not the story .
The bigger message is that Apple has finally stopped ignoring the incessant buzz of the hobby - hacking , Mac netbook scene and instead pulled out a fly - swatter and dealt it a whack .
The war is officially on .
And ironically , this will only hit the hobbyists and tinkerers .
Psystar , that other flea in Apple 's ear , is unaffected , as the fake Macs it sells do not use the Atom chip .
Official : Atom not supported in 10.6.2 [ Stell 's Blog ]

Over the last couple of weeks , Wikipedia , the free , open - access encyclopedia , has taken a great deal of flak in the press for problems related to the credibility of its authors and its general accountability .
In particular , Wikipedia has taken hits for its inclusion , for four months , of an anonymously written article linking former journalist John Seigenthaler to the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and John F. Kennedy .
At the same time , the blogosphere was buzzing for several days about of anonymously deleting references to others ' seminal work on the technology .
In response to situations like these and others in its history , Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales has always maintained that the service and its community are built around a self - policing and self - cleaning nature that is supposed to ensure its articles are accurate .
Still , many critics have tried to downplay its role as a source of valid information and have often pointed to the Encyclopedia Britannica as an example of an accurate reference .
For its study , Nature chose articles from both sites in a wide range of topics and sent them to what it called " relevant " field experts for peer review .
The experts then compared the competing articles -- one from each site on a given topic -- side by side , but were not told which article came from which site .
Nature got back 42 usable reviews from its field of experts .
In the end , the journal found just eight serious errors , such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts , in the articles .
Of those , four came from each site .
They did , however , discover a series of factual errors , omissions or misleading statements .
All told , Wikipedia had 162 such problems , while Britannica had 123 .
That averages out to 2.92 mistakes per article for Britannica and 3.86 for Wikipedia .
" An expert - led investigation carried out by Nature - - the first to use peer review to compare Wikipedia and Britannica 's coverage of science , " the journal wrote , " suggests that such high - profile examples ( like the Seigenthaler and Curry situations ) are the exception rather than the rule . "
And to Wales , while Britannica came out looking a little bit more accurate than Wikipedia , the Nature study was validation of his service 's fundamental structure .
" I was very pleased , just to see that ( the study ) was reasonably favorable , " Wales told CNET News.com .
" I think it provides , for us , a great counterpoint to the press coverage we 've gotten recently , because it puts the focus on the broader quality and not just one article . "
He also acknowledged that the error rate for each encyclopedia was not insignificant , and added that he thinks such numbers demonstrate that broad review of encyclopedia articles is needed .
He also said that the results belie the notion that Britannica is infallible .
" I have very great respect for Britannica , " Wales said .
But " I think there is a general view among a lot of people that it has no errors , like , ' I read it in Britannica , it must be true . '
It 's good that people see that there are a lot of errors everywhere . "
To Britannica officials , however , the Nature results showed that Wikipedia still has a way to go .
" The ( Nature ) article is saying that Wikipedia has a third more errors " than Britannica , said Jorge Cauz , president of Encyclopedia Britannica .
But Cauz and editor in chief Dale Hoiberg also said they were concerned that Nature had not specified the problems that it had found in Britannica .
" We 've asked them a number of questions about the process they used , " Hoiberg said .
" They said in ( their article ) that the inaccuracies included errors , omissions and misleading statements .
But there 's no indication of how many of each .
So we 're very eager to look at that and explore it because we take it very seriously . "

Military helicopters and ships scoured the waters off San Diego on Friday for nine people involved in a midair collision between a Coast Guard plane and a Marine Corps helicopter .
After searching most of the day , rescue teams did not find any survivors or bodies , only a field of debris floating in the Pacific .
Military officials said they did not know how the crash had occurred , or which aircraft had struck the other , saying they were focused on search efforts .
Seven people were aboard the Coast Guard ’s C - 130 transport plane and two were in the Marine Corps ’ AH - 1 Cobra helicopter when the crash occurred Thursday at 7:10 p.m. , officials said .
They were flying 15 to 25 miles east of San Clemente Island , a narrow strip of land off the Southern California coast used by the Navy for training exercises .
Right before the crash , air traffic controllers with the Federal Aviation Administration told the Coast Guard pilot “ to contact military air traffic controllers , ” said Ian Gregor , an F.A.A. spokesman .

Blackwater guards are accused of firing on civilians in the 2007 incident
US prosecutors have asked for charges against one of five Blackwater security guards accused of killing up to 17 unarmed Iraqi civilians to be dropped .
No reason was given for the move to dismiss charges against Nicholas Slatten , of Tennessee .
But prosecutors left open the option of reinstating proceedings at a later date .
Four other men are due to face trial in February over the 16 September 2007 incident in the Iraqi capital .
A sixth pleaded guilty and agreed to co-operate with prosecutors .
The killings - which strained Iraq - US relations - took place when Blackwater guards opened fire in Baghdad 's Nisoor Square while escorting an American diplomatic convoy .
The firm says its guards were acting in self - defence but witnesses and relatives of those killed maintain that the shooting was unprovoked .
The US says 14 people were killed but an Iraqi investigation put the number at 17 .
Children were among those killed , and several people were wounded .
Iraq later withdrew Blackwater 's licence to operate within its borders and the US government stopped using the firm to guard its diplomats in Iraq .
Blackwater has changed its name to Xe Services .
Scozzafava has received few kind words in the press from members of the state GOP , who are still fuming over her decision .
Scozzafava : GOP attacks were ' vicious '
Dede Scozzafava , the GOP nominee who dropped out of New York ’s special election last week to endorse Democrat Bill Owens , said Wednesday that the attacks against her from fellow Republicans were “ vicious . ”
In an interview with CNN — her first television appearance since leaving the race — Scozzafava said hearing the criticism of her from within Republican ranks was “ difficult to overcome . ”
Advertisement
“ The attacks were pretty vicious , ” she said , “ especially since it was coming from people that identified themselves as Republicans . ”
Scozzafava has received few kind words in the press from members of the state GOP , who are still fuming over her decision to suspend her campaign and endorse
Owens only days before the election .
With Scozzafava out , Owens became the first Democrat to win the upstate congressional district in over 100 years , beating Conservative Party nominee Doug Hoffman , 49 percent to 46 percent .
Scozzafava , whose name remained on the ballot , received 5 percent of the vote .
Scozzafava resigned from her spot in the state ’s Assembly leadership on Monday after meeting with Assembly Minority Leader Brain Kolb , who had been fielding complaints about Scozzafava from his members .
Asked about what the election ’s result means for her party , Scozzafava said that “ hopefully a lesson can be learned and we can move forward and make the party stronger and understand that there are many voices that make a party but we can all agree around core principles . ”
“ I hope that races can revolve around the needs of the district that the people are running to represent , ” the Republican assemblywoman said .
“ You ’re never going to have perfect ideology .
If you are you 're never going to move forward because no one 's going to think independently . ”

The UK received intelligence days before invading Iraq that Saddam Hussein may not have been able to use chemical weapons , an adviser has said .
Foreign Office official Sir William Ehrman told the war inquiry that a report suggested that such weapons may have been " disassembled " .
A separate report suggested Iraq might also " lack " warheads capable of spreading chemical agents , he added .
But Sir William defended the invasion , saying Iraq had flouted UN resolutions .
' WMD surprise ' Sir William , the Foreign Office 's director general for defence and intelligence between 2002 and 2004 , insisted that the role of intelligence in the decision to go to war was " limited " .
He also said it was a " surprise " no weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) were ever found in Iraq .
" It was not what we had expected , " he added .
The reasons for going to war in Iraq - including the now discredited claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction which could be used within 45 minutes of an order being given - remain a long - standing source of controversy .
In its second day of public hearings , the inquiry looked into Iraq 's weapons capability and its influence on the decision to go to war .
During this , Sir William revealed that on 10 March " we did ... get a report that chemical weapons might have remained disassembled and Saddam had n't yet ordered their assembly . "
WITNESSES ON WEDNESDAY
William Ehrman : Foreign Office 's director of international security ( 2000/02 ) and director general of defence and intelligence ( 2002 - 2004 )
Tim Dowse : Foreign Office 's head of counter - proliferation ( 2001 - 2003 )
Q&A : Iraq war inquiry Analysis : tolerant or critical ?
How US has investigated Iraq war Iraq inquiry ' suffocated ' - Clegg
He added : " There was also a suggestion that Iraq might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents . "
But Sir William added there was " contradictory intelligence " .
" I do n't think it invalidated the point about what weapons he had .
It was more about their use .
Even if they were disassembled the ( chemical or biological ) agents still existed . "
The BBC 's world affairs correspondent Peter Biles said a lot of the intelligence which the government received in the run-up to the war was confused and , as previous inquiries have shown , inaccurate .
But the Lib Dems said it was a " dramatic revelation " and seemed to contradict Tony Blair 's statement in Parliament that Iraq posed a " clear and present danger " to international security .
" This is really damning for the former prime minister , " said the party 's foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey .
" To go to war when you are not absolutely certain about your case raises serious questions about whether international law was broken . "
Intelligence gaps Asked to explain the absence of WMD and why the UK government had got this wrong , Sir William noted a " great deal " of the intelligence about Iraq 's chemical and biological weapons production provided before the war had been withdrawn afterwards as false .
He also said the situation had been complicated by Saddam Hussein not wanting to reveal the true state of his weapons arsenal for fear of showing himself " quite so weak " to Iran .

Addressing the overall threat posed by Iraq in 2001 , the Foreign Office said it was " not top of its list " of countries causing concern because of their stated desire to develop weapons of mass destruction , ranking below Iran , North Korea and Libya .
With sanctions in place against Iraq , the Foreign Office believed Saddam Hussein could not build a nuclear weapon and , even if sanctions were removed , it was estimated it would take him five years to do so .
Tim Dowse - Foreign Office Director of Counter - Proliferation between 2001 and 2003 - said most evidence suggested Iraq 's chemical and biological programme had largely been " destroyed " in 1991 .
Intelligence in late 2002 suggested Iraq was rebuilding its capability , he said , although its actual position had been unclear since weapons inspectors were expelled in 1998 .
He was black and he had to prove himself white .
He did not do so

Iraq inquiry : Day - by - day timeline
But he said the threat posed by Iraq was viewed as " unique " from other " deliberate proliferators " because it had shown itself willing to use weapons of mass destruction on its own people and its neighbours and was flouting a range of UN disarmament resolutions .
Turning to the months leading up to the war , Sir William said Saddam Hussein failed to comply with " two key tests " in UN Security Resolution 1441 , requiring him to provide a " full declaration " of Iraq 's weapons capacity and to fully co-operate with UN weapons inspectors .
" He [ Saddam Hussein ] was black and he had to prove himself white .
He did not do so . "
Inspection process Weapons inspectors entered 10 out of 19 Iraqi sites under suspicion of concealing WMD in the weeks before the invasion , Sir William said .
He told the inquiry they uncovered illegal materials , documents and weapons components at four of these sites although none proving the existence of an active WMD programme .
Sir William said the process showed a pattern of non-compliance , describing it as a " pretty good strike rate " on the basis of the intelligence available at the time .
INQUIRY TIMELINE November - December : Former top civil servants , spy chiefs , diplomats and military commanders to give evidence January - February 2010 : Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and other politicians expected to appear before the panel March 2010 : Inquiry expected to adjourn ahead of the general election campaign July - August 2010 : Inquiry expected to resume Report set to be published in late 2010 or early 2011 Asked why ministers were not warned that active WMD programmes may not be found in Iraq because they did not exist , Mr Dowse said : " We could have briefed ministers ' perhaps we are wrong ' but we did not actually think that we were wrong .
The evidence seemed , to us , to be confirming us in our view . "
Giving inspectors more time to do their work - as called for by France and Russia - may have helped " diplomatically and politically " , he said .
But he said this would not have made any difference to the ultimate outcome without full Iraqi co-operation , which was not forthcoming .
Terrorist links
The inquiry also learnt that the UK investigated and rejected suggestions of links between Saddam Hussein and Al - Qaeda .
Following the 9/11 attacks , the Foreign Office looked at the matter " very carefully " , Mr Dowse said , and concluded there was " nothing that looked like a relationship between the Iraqis and al - Qaeda " .
" After 9/11 we concluded that Iraq had stepped further back and they did not want to be associated with al - Qaeda , " he said .
" They were not natural allies . "
The inquiry , looking at the whole period from 2001 to 2009 , was set up by Prime Minister Gordon Brown , who also chose the panel .
On Thursday it will interview Sir Christopher Meyer , the former UK ambassador to Washington , about transatlantic relations in the lead - up to the war .
Mr Brown and predecessor Tony Blair are expected to be among future witnesses , with the final report due early in 2011 .
The prime minister has rejected claims by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg that government departments could veto parts of the final report .
Previously , the Butler inquiry looked at intelligence failures before the war , while the Hutton inquiry examined the circumstances leading to the death of former government adviser David Kelly .

En la ciudad de México se atienden en promedio 80 casos al día de víctimas de bullying en las escuelas , informó Gabriela Rodríguez , coordinadora de la campaña “ Escuelas sin violencia ” de la Secretaría de Educación del gobierno capitalino .
Dijo que el Centro de Atención de la dependencia recibe un promedio de 300 llamadas y solicitudes por internet de padres , alumnos y profesores afectados por este problema .
Entrevistada durante la clausura del Seminario de Reflexión Permanente “ Escuelas Conviviendo ” , la especialista informó que las primeras en llamar son las madres , que están al borde de la desesperación y a punto de cambiar a sus hijos de plantel académico para que no sigan siendo víctimas de la agresión .
“ Nos hablan angustiadas , con mucho temor y enojo , para pedir ayuda .
Nos llaman cuando el niño ya está en situación de depresión importante , porque ya tuvo algún intento de suicidio , ya no quiere ir a la escuela , no puede dormir , tiene vómito .
Son síntomas de que está en una situación de violencia ” .
En segundo lugar , son los propios niños y niñas los que piden ayuda , en su mayor parte vía internet en la página de la SE .
Los siguen los profesores , que ven en su entorno esta conducta definida como el maltrato e intimidación física y verbal entre alumnos de una escuela .
“ El bullying es una forma de violencia intencionada , planeada , premeditada durante todo el ciclo escolar y casi durante todo el tiempo que el niño o niña se encuentran dentro de la escuela ” , definió la especialista .
Revelaciones de estudio Basada en los resultados de un estudio realizado en 29 escuelas primarias y secundarias , y 16 centros de desarrollo infantil de nivel preescolar , entre la SEDF y la Universidad Intercontinental , Gabriela Rodríguez aseguró que 44 % de los niños y niñas de las escuelas están en situación de bullying , ya sea como testigos observadores , como víctimas de la violencia o como quienes la ejercen .
Destacó que las niñas son las más afectadas “ por ser educadas como más débiles , más pasivas ; si son agredidas , simplemente por ser más niñas , sí hay un porcentaje más alto ” .
La funcionaria dijo que el bullying es un fenómeno que se da en escuelas públicas y privadas , tanto en zonas marginadas como en aquellas de situación media .
“ En las particulares se pelean por la marca de la ropa o se discriminan entre sí .
En una de alta marginalidad las niñas se pelean por el novio o por quién trae las uñas más largas .
Cambian las formas , pero los niveles de violencia son iguales ” .
La encargada de la campaña de la SEDF aseguró que las causas de este fenómeno son multifactoriales pues “ como sociedad vivimos una situación de violencia creciente en todos los sentidos y ámbitos , y quienes la reciben y la expresan de manera directa son los niños y niñas , no cuidan muchas formas de expresarla como los adultos , que es más sutil y disfrazada ” .
Para revertir la violencia , dijo , se necesita promover nuevas formas de buen trato y de no violencia activa .
As a general rule manuscript illumination has long - since gone the way of lighthearted children 's books .
Crumb , however , takes on the daunting task with a fierce intelligence and the graphic skill one expects from a founding father of the radical underground comics movement .
( His first issue of the counterculture masterwork , Zap Comix , was published in San Francisco in 1968 . )
Crumb 's familiar drawing style — black ink , a tremulous line , dense cross-hatching that darkens the field and electrifies the light through contrast — gives Genesis the punch of a heavy graphic novel .
The more bracing of the two is “ The Bible Illuminated : R. Crumb 's Book of Genesis ” at the UCLA Hammer Museum .
Robert Crumb spent nearly five years thinking about and drawing 206 sheets to illuminate the first book of the Old Testament — chapter by chapter , scene by scene — inside rectilinear panels ( as many as six per sheet ) whose wavy contours frame events with nervous visual energy .
At the Hammer , the sheets are lined up edge to edge around one gallery , as well as around a circular wall built in the center of the room .
Two small museum shows put current cartoons in our sights .
In different ways , both use the form as a method to consider ancient texts .
Make that 140 years if you believe ( as I do ) that the brushy , broken , unfinished - surface look of Impressionist paintings derived from the oil sketches that artists of the French Academy used to map out the slick , highly finished surfaces of their often grandiose canvases .
They called those preparatory sketches cartoons , and the Impressionists latched onto their raw energy .
Cartoons have been art 's most common language going on 50 years , ever since Roy Lichtenstein painted Mickey Mouse and Edward Ruscha conjured Little Orphan Annie .
Consider God , who appears in the first panel spinning a black void as if it were a dangerous , cosmic play - toy .
( As the story unfolds , that 's sort of what it turns out to have been . )
Crumb's
God pushes the standard visual motif of an old man with white hair and a flowing beard into an ancient man with locks and whiskers that practically reach the floor .
A scowl is almost permanently implanted on his face , as might befit a demanding Old Testament deity known for doling out retribution .
Rather than do what many of the artist 's research - models displayed inside the circular room do —
Bible comics that lighten the book 's frequently dark mood , biblical epics from Hollywood that sprinkle star - dust in heaping helpings — Crumb plays it straight .
Thick - bodied men and women with blunt expressions enact a straightforward text with a minimum of fuss .
That 's not to say Crumb skimps on carnality or gore .
Genesis is often emotionally brutal , physically violent and sexually startling .
( It 's not for kids , nor is this rendition . )
For instance , some argue that Eve was made the fateful agent of sin in the garden of Eden , giving the apple to Adam , as a way to undermine the ancient power held by matriarchy ; the velocity with which Crumb 's fall from grace unfolds — the bliss is all over in 11 pages — packs a wallop .
Engaging a master of the profane like Crumb to tell a sacred story could have proven to be a wincing gimmick , but he 's too good an artist for that .
Crumb announces in a hand - lettered forward that he's not a believer in the divinity of the Bible 's authorship , and that sense of human origins is conveyed by his distinctive drawing style .
( He used Robert Alter 's 1996 English translation of the Pentateuch , plus the King James Version . )
The invigorating result is the restoration of historical literary and artistic power to a world - changing narrative .
The same cannot be said for “ Heroes and Villains : The Battle for Good in India 's Comics ” at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art .
The show is certainly fun , even lighthearted , but it 's also lightweight .
Modern Indian comic books are paired with manuscripts chosen from the museum 's collection and dating from the Mughal empire .
( Most came to LACMA from the great Paul F. Walter and Nasli and Alice Heeramaneck collections . )
The connections between new comics and old manuscripts are largely narrative — the Ramayana , for example , an ancient Hindu epic told in classical paintings in opaque watercolor and adapted today by Liquid Comics , a company based in Bangalore but employing digital collaboration in Los Angeles and New York .
Twenty framed comic - book pages are on display , but it 's the 15 black ink drawings for several of them that capture attention .
Beautifully rendered in pencil and black ink , the images bristle with elaborate , melodramatic flair .
Using sharp - tipped pens and dry brushes , the artists create flat , intricately patterned figures who dominate the space with extreme , violent gestures .
An engaging nearby video shows how digital coloring and embellishment are added .
The result is almost Gothic in its dark mysticism .
But these are merely the processes by which the actual artworks — the comic books — are mass - produced ; it 's telling that the production story is more compelling than the thin ( if admittedly amusing ) finished product .
That 's not the case with the smashing Mughal watercolors in the next gallery , dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries .
Their style is mostly classical — flat , stately relief figures in a dramatic hierarchy .
The manuscripts create a powerful illusion of eternal verity that could n't be more different from the playful , short - attention - span theater of their comic book progeny .
The pre-modern drawings are n't steps to something else ; they are the main event .

Google appears to be preparing to market its own smartphone , a move that would intensify the company ’s rivalry with Apple , whose iPhone dominates the high - end smartphone market in the United States .
On Friday , Google distributed a new phone running its own Android operating software to many of its employees .
On the messaging service Twitter , some Google employees described the device as a “ Google phone , ” renewing speculation that the company is getting ready to release a mobile phone with its own brand .
Google employees who asked not to be identified confirmed recently that the company was indeed developing new hardware and software for Android phones and coming up with new ways to get those phones into the hands of consumers , but they would not give more details .
One Google employee said the new phone , which is being made by HTC , a major Taiwanese cellphone maker , was designed from the ground up by Google .
The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site late Saturday that Google would sell the phone directly to consumers rather than through carriers , which sell the bulk of mobile phones in the United States .
Globalive hits YouTube with funny ads
By Peter Nowak , CBCNews.ca .
It 's now two weeks until D - Day for Canada 's prospective fourth ( almost ) national cellphone carrier — the CRTC has said it will rule by Oct. 23 whether Globalive meets Canadian control rules — but the company is already rolling out ads .
And they 're funny .
A quick recap : Globalive , which are the folks behind Yak long - distance and internet service , paid a big whack of money last year to purchase airwaves across the country , except in Quebec , in a government auction .
The company is backed largely by Egypt - based Orascom , which operates cellphone service in Greece and Italy , among other places .
Industry Canada , the government ministry that oversees cellphone airwaves , rubber - stamped Globalive 's ownership structure as compliant with Canadian ownership laws .
Existing carriers , led by Telus , complained and forced a public ownership review by the CRTC .
Those hearings were held last month , Globalive has offered up some changes to its structure , and now everyone is waiting with bated breath for the outcome .
Globalive , which plans to operate under Orascom 's Wind brand in Canada , is pretty confident it will pass muster .
The company intends to launch service in Toronto and Calgary by the end of this year and is so confident , it has put out some video ads on YouTube .

We ’ve noted the corporate media ’s double standard on Nazi analogies :
When conservatives are compared to the Third Reich , however obscurely , it ’s an outrageous slur , but when leaders of the right charge progressives with Hitler - like tendencies , it ’s unremarkable political rhetoric .
Political Animal ‘s Steve Benen ( 12/8/09 ) rounds up some similar examples of criticisms that are outrageous when applied by the left to the right , but no big deal when they go the other way –starting with the manufactured controversy over Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ’s likening Republican foot - dragging over healthcare reform to conservatives ’ lack of urgency over women ’s suffrage and ending slavery :
If we ’re to believe the faux - outrage , the reference to slavery was the rhetorical element that went too far .
But this , apparently , is a new concern –the right has been far more direct in making the same comparison .
Harry Reid was talking about key moments in history in which the right was wrong , but Michele Bachmann recently called the Democrats ’ legislative agenda “ nothing more than slavery , ” and no one said a word .
Indeed , conservatives routinely insist that the left is trying “ enslave ” America , and the political mainstream just shrugs its shoulders in response .
This is not uncommon .
In 2005 , Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) described the Bush administration ’s torture policies and system of secret prisons as being reminiscent of “ Soviets in their gulags . ”
At the time , the media and Republicans were apoplectic about Durbin ’s remarks , sparking a week - long frenzy .
Several conservatives called on the Senate to censure Durbin , and Karl Rove , at the time a high - ranking White House official , argued that Durbin ’s quote was evidence that liberals are traitors .
Durbin eventually offered a tearful apology .
But notice that just a few days ago , Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , a member of the Senate Republican leadership , called Medicaid a “ health care gulag . ” Rep. John Shadegg ( R - Ariz . ) recently called Dems ’ health care reform efforts “ Soviet - style gulag health care . ”
Neither reporters nor other members of Congress batted an eye .
Also note , when Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) said Republicans are promoting lethal healthcare policies , it was a huge national controversy .
When Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) said the same thing , no one seemed to care .
Journalists really ought to try putting the next GOP press release on this topic in the circular bin .
“ He called me a name back ” is a complaint that you should have learned not to take seriously by the second grade .

Just wait for Climate Legislation ...
Brad Friedman Byon 12/9/2009 , 1:47 pm PT
David Kurtz at TPM avers " It never stops " :
whopping $ 1 billion was spent this year --- a non-election year --- on political ads , according to a leading political advertising expert .
Most of the money was spent on issue ads , the biggest chunk of that going to health care reform ads , pro and con .
And , guess what ?
If you think that 's bad , just wait until we get to Climate Legislation proper , where the Petroleum Industry , some of the largest and most profitable corporations in the history of civilization --- in no small part , thanks to enormous federal subsidies --- have a direct financial stake in the outcome .
( Yes , the world 's most profitable corporations benefit mightily from U.S. government welfare , your tax - payer dollars , to the tune of some $ 72 billion over the last seven years in permanent subsidies .
See the handy chart below the fold to see how those subsidies stack up against other energy industries , such as renewables .
Never mind the worldwide recession .
Exxon Mobil profited more than $ 45 billion last year , Chevron $ 23 billion , and the federal subsidies keep coming nonetheless , even as their stooges in the Tea Party denialist " ClimateGater " crowds have been duped into mindlessly continuing their dirty work for them . )
The Oil and Coal ( Fossil Fuel ) Industries have played no small part in ginning up the tea bagging fight against health care reform if only because it further serves to stall Climate Legislation .
It 's horrible , an abrogation of what the Founding Fathers likely had in mind ( nowhere , to my knowledge , does the support for unbridled corporate spending as " free speech " come into play in the Constitution at last read ) and yet all signs suggest it 's only going to get far worse before it gets any better --- if it ever does .
See the chart below to understand how the federal welfare queens from Exxon Mobil and Chevron et al .
make out , thanks to your hard - earned tax dollars , and keep it in mind every time you hear yet another global warming denialist out there --- and even here in comments at The BRAD BLOG --- hoping to punk the world for more such free money and endless , record corporate profits ...
The Ford Motor Company and the Chinese automaker , Zhejiang Geely Holding Group , said Wednesday that they had settled “ all substantive ” details on a sale of Volvo , clearing the way for Geely to buy Ford ’s Swedish unit .
The automakers said that while final documentation , financing and government approvals remain to be completed , “ Ford and Geely anticipate that a definitive sale agreement will be signed in the first quarter of 2010 , with closing of the sale likely to occur in the second quarter of 2010 , subject to appropriate regulatory approvals . ”
The companies did not disclose a price .
“ That kind of detail will come when we have a definitive agreement , ” a Ford spokesman in London , John Gardiner , said .
His shade apologised for letting down his fans by not carrying out the This Is It tour , but stopped short of offering to reimburse anyone .
He also claimed to be glad to be visiting London on his astral journey , saying it is a “ loving city ” .
Over a year ago , Android fans saw the debut of Opera Mini for Android .
This past January we let you know the company launched Opera Mini version 4.2 to the Android Market .
But I assume the existence of an alternative browser in Android Market has largely fallen on deaf ears – the Web - kit based default browser provided by Google is already quite capable .
But Opera is n’t going out easily .
According to CEO Jon von Tetzchner , the company is working on producing a full Opera Mobile version for Android , something that exists for Windows Mobile and Symbian only as of now .
The “ mini ” version of Opera passes web data through Opera ’s servers and re-renders the pages for mobile optimized viewing whereas the complete version would display the full HTML display .
Can Opera compete and / or does anyone care ?
I definitely think so .
Mobile web browsing is far from perfect and we ’ve got a LONG way to go in the field .
There is a TON of room for innovation and Opera is in a position to make an impact .
While Google ’s “ Chrome Lite ” comes prepackaged with Google Experience Android phones , I assume that those without the Google branding are free to choose a competing default browser .
Perhaps Opera can build some relationships and sign some contracts to become the default browser on a number of handsets ?
As of now the details and timeline for the project are unknown – heck , there is no guarantee an actual full Opera for Android will ever launch , we just know it is being worked on .
But the more minds focused on perfecting mobile web browsing the better , if you ask me .
President Obama has already hit the links as much as President Bush did in over two years .
| Photo by AP Photo Close
President Barack Obama has only been in office for just over nine months , but he 's already hit the links as much as President Bush did in over two years .
CBS ' Mark Knoller — an unofficial documentarian and statistician of all things White House - related — wrote on his Twitter feed that , " Today - Obama ties Pres .
Bush in the number of rounds of golf played in office : 24 .
Took Bush 2 yrs & 10 months . "
This news comes on the heels of today 's news that Obama played golf with a woman — chief domestic policy adviser Melody Barnes — for the first time since taking office .

Geithner gets feisty with the Congressman right around the 2:50 mark , but the whole thing is worth watching .
Better than that friggin’ “ V ” tv show on ABC at least .
The Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that an alternative health care bill put forward by House Republicans would have little impact in extending health benefits to the roughly 30 million uninsured Americans , but would reduce average insurance premium costs for people who have coverage .
The Republican bill , which has no chance of passage , would extend insurance coverage to about 3 million people by 2019 , and would leave about 52 million people uninsured , the budget office said , meaning the proportion of non-elderly Americans with coverage would remain about the same as now , at roughly 83 percent .
The budget office has said that the Democrats ’ health care proposal would extend coverage to 36 million people , meaning that 96 percent of legal residents would have health benefits .
The Democrats ’ bill would cost $ 1.1 trillion , with the costs more than covered by revenues from new taxes or cuts in government spending , particularly on Medicare .
House Republicans , including their leader , Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , have said that they did not intend for their legislation to expand insurance coverage , because they viewed that goal as unaffordable .
Instead , they said the bill was tailored narrowly to reduce costs .
According to the report by nonpartisan budget office , the Republican bill would reduce future federal deficits by $ 68 billion over 10 years , compared to a reduction of $ 104 billion by the House Democrats ’ legislation .
The findings by the budget office mostly seemed to confirm assertions by Democrats that the Republican bill , offered as an amendment to the Democrats ’ measure , would do little to change the status quo .
But Republicans will certainly find aspects of the cost analysis to brag about .
The budget office predicted savings for the federal government of $ 41 billion over 10 years as a result of provisions to limit costs related to medical malpractice lawsuits .
In addition , many Republicans have said the country cannot afford a hugely expensive health care bill at a time of staggering federal deficits , and the total cost of insurance provisions in the Republican bill would be just $ 61 billion compared to $ 1.1 trillion for the Democrats ’ bill .
The budget office also said that the Republican bill would reduce average insurance premiums , though the budget office cautioned that its calculations in that regard were subject to a high degree of uncertainty .
The budget office said that in the Republican plan , premiums would be reduced the most for people who buy insurance in the individual or small - group market , but that people who get large - group insurance through their employers would also see some reduction in cost .
“ The combination of provisions included in the amendment would reduce average private health insurance premiums per enrollee in the United States relative to what they would be under current law , ” the budget office said .
It said premiums would be cut by 7 percent to 10 percent in the small group market ; by 5 percent to 8 percent in the individual market ; and by up to 3 percent in the large group market , which is where 80 percent of Americans get their coverage .
The budget office carefully hedged its findings , writing : “ Some provisions of the legislation would tend to decrease the premiums paid by all insurance enrollees , while other provisions would tend to increase the premiums paid by less healthy enrollees or would tend to increase the premiums paid by enrollees in some states relative to enrollees in other states .
As a result , some individuals and families within each market would see reductions in premiums that would be larger or smaller than the estimated average reductions , and some people would see increases . 
The estimates of changes in average premiums are very preliminary and are subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty . ”
Republicans hailed the budget office findings as evidence that they had produced a superior bill , while Democrats ridiculed the same findings as evidence that the Republican bill would accomplish virtually nothing .
“ Across the country the American people are calling on Washington to pass responsible reform that will lower health care costs , ” Representative Mike Pence of Indiana , the No. 3 House Republican said in a statement late Wednesday .
“ Yesterday , House Republicans answered that call by putting forward common - sense health care legislation that reduces the deficit , lowers premiums , and ensures coverage for those with pre-existing conditions . ”
But Representative George Miller , Democrat of California , chairman of the Education and Labor Committee and one of the main architects of the Democrats ’ bill , said the Republicans had come up short .
“ Tonight CBO confirmed that the Republicans ’ only solution for health reform is to preserve the status quo , ” Mr. Miller said in a statement .
“ It will leave 52 million Americans literally out in the cold , does nothing to help low - income and middle - class families afford quality health care , and protects insurance companies ’ power to deny claims and stand between patients and their doctors . ”
Rapid rise ... after less than seven years in Parliament , Kristina Keneally overthrew Nathan Rees 47 votes to 21 to become Premier .
Credit : Brendan Esposito But Ms Keneally 's reign will be tainted from day one after the man she ousted , Nathan Rees , declared yesterday morning : '' Should I not be Premier by the end of this day , let there be no doubt in the community 's mind , no doubt , that any challenger will be a puppet of Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi . ''
Ms Keneally later retorted in Parliament when confronted with Opposition questions about Mr Rees 's comments : '' Let me be absolutely clear on this : I 'm nobody 's puppet .
I am nobody 's protege , I am nobody 's girl . ''
Sources from the Right said Ms Keneally beat her predecessor as planning minister , Frank Sartor , in a Right caucus ballot by 25 votes to 22 to win its endorsement to take on Mr Rees at a meeting of the full caucus last night .
Mr Sartor was understood to be angry at the ' ' betrayal ' ' by John Della Bosca and Tony Kelly .
He believed they voted against him and cost him the premiership .
A spill motion in caucus was won 43 - 25 , with some Right votes spilling behind Mr Rees .
The 47 - 21 vote for premier reflected the Left faction siding with Mr Rees and the Right faction aligning with Ms Keneally , barring one or two votes .
Ms Keneally won the leadership without the backing of Labor 's head office but had the support of the powerbrokers and enemies of Mr Rees , Eddie Obeid , Joe Tripodi , John Della Bosca and Ian Macdonald .
At a news conference last night Ms Keneally said she had challenged Mr Rees for the leadership so she could heal the party of divisions .
She said she would not put Mr Tripodi back into cabinet , saying he was a ' ' good minister ' ' but his time had passed .
But she would not rule out giving Mr Della Bosca and Mr Macdonald ministries .
She said she had offered Mr Sartor a ministry and wanted to talk to Mr Rees about a senior role in government .
She denied she was a puppet , saying she had exercised her own mind since she was a ' ' little girl ' ' and rang a talkback radio station in the US at age eight to tell a bishop girls should be allowed to become altar servers .
She said : '' Governments earn trust from the community .
I intend to restore that trust . ''
At a news conference at 9 am yesterday Mr Rees prepared the groundwork for Ms Keneally 's opponents by claiming a vote against him was a vote against the integrity of government .
'' I will not hand the Government of NSW over to Obeid , Tripodi or Sartor , '' he said .
'' Under my leadership there will be no going back .
The old regime will never again dictate the fortunes of our party , nor will they regain the levers of control . ''
Ms Keneally was backed into the job by Mr Tripodi three weeks after Mr Rees axed him from cabinet .
She was seen in Mr Tripodi 's office yesterday .
Powerbrokers decided to move after a Herald poll on Saturday found Mr Tripodi 's sacking gave no bounce to the Government 's standing .
Mr Sartor failed despite the backing of Labor 's state president , Bernie Riordan , and the general secretary , Matt Thistlethwaite .
When it became clear Mr Sartor would not beat Ms Keneally , Mr Thistlethwaite approached the Deputy Premier , Carmel Tebbutt , to stand but she declined .
Loading A Rees supporter questioned why Mr Thistlethwaite had gone to Mr Sartor .
'' I think we might n't be having this conversation if he'd stuck with Rees .
I think that was a tactical blunder . ''
But a senior Labor source said Mr Rees would have had more chance of saving his job had he not come out with his '' puppet ' ' quote about Ms Keneally .
Free trade is never more necessary — or vulnerable — than in times of economic distress .
The current global downturn is no exception .
Protectionist barriers have shot up all over the world , including the United States .
Earlier this year , Congress killed a pilot program allowing Mexican trucks to transport goods across America and included " Buy America " provisions in the stimulus bill banning foreign steel and iron from infrastructure projects funded by the legislation .
More disturbingly , President Barack Obama , after chiding Congress for flirting with protectionism , initiated his own ill - advised affair by imposing a 35 percent tariff on cheap Chinese tires .
If the world manages to avoid an all - out trade war of the kind that helped trigger the Great Depression after the U.S. imposed the Smoot - Hawley tariffs in 1930 , it will be in no small part due to the efforts of one man : Jagdish N. Bhagwati , an ebullient and irreverent 76 - year - old professor of economics at Columbia University .
Bhagwati has done more than perhaps any other person alive to advance the cause of unfettered global trade .
A native of India , Bhagwati immigrated to the United States in the late ' 60s after a brief stint on the Indian Planning Commission , where he learned first - hand the insanity of an economic approach that tried to modernize a country by cutting it off from world trade .
Since then , he has devoted his efforts , both in academia and in the popular press , to showing that there is no better way of improving the lot of both advanced countries and the developing world than through free trade .
His path - breaking contributions to trade theory have put him on the short list for a Nobel Prize in economics .
Though a dogged trade advocate , Bhagwati is anything but dogmatic .
He is a free spirit who draws intellectual inspiration from many disparate ideological camps .
A self - avowed liberal , he is also something of a Gandhian social progressive , though Gandhi himself supported economic autarky .
Bhagwati works with numerous Third World NGOs on a host of human rights issues .
Yet he has no problem taking on these groups — or his famous student , Nobel laureate Paul Krugman — when they question the benefits of trade .
In fact , he devoted his 2004 magnum opus , In Defense of Globalization , to a point - by - point rebuttal of these critics .
Although he does n't vote Republican because he dislikes the party 's nationalistic jingoism , he readily declares that Democrats pose a far bigger threat to international exchange than Republicans .
This summer Shikha Dalmia , a senior analyst at the Reason Foundation , interviewed Bhagwati in his New York office .
reason :
You have been on the short list for a Nobel Prize in economics for your contribution to trade theory .
Could you explain what your main contribution is ?
Jagdish Bhagwati :
My breakthrough in trade theory was very simple , as all breakthroughs are .
Back in the 1950s , when the case for free trade was widely regarded as less compelling analytically than today , protectionists had one very powerful argument on their side .
They noted that a country necessarily benefits from free trade only when markets are perfect — that is to say , only when market prices reflect true social costs can we expect these prices to guide allocation correctly .
Take pollution .
Say your production process makes you spew things into the air and water but you do not have to pay for this pollution .
Then the social cost of harming others is not being taken into account by you and hence your production costs are less than the " correct " social costs .
So you could take two points of view .
The time - honored view was that when there is such " market failure , " or what might be better called a " missing market , " the case for free trade was compromised and any form of protectionism was justified .
I argued that if you had a market failure , fix that , and you are back to perfect markets and the legitimacy of free trade .
So , for example , you can have a polluter - pay principle on the environment .
If you do that , then there 's no damaging spillover which has not been taken into account .
The proper policy response then is not to abandon free trade but rather to fix the market failure and then to embrace free trade .
This was a revolutionary thought .
For 200 years , serious economists had abandoned free trade in the presence of market failures of one kind or another .
reason :
In Defense of Globalization was addressed to non-academic critics of free trade and globalization who claim that globalization does not have a human face .
What was your argument ?
Bhagwati :
When I was in Seattle in 1999 , when everything went haywire as far as trying to get a new round of trade negotiations , I realized that the young people who were agitating , and some of the older folks also , were not interested in whether trade was good for national income and prosperity .
They were claiming that globalization has an adverse impact on a whole lot of social issues — gender equity issues , environmental issues , the effects of globalization on the polity and democratic rights .
In short , to use the fetching phrase , they were concerned that economic globalization lacked a human face .
My book addressed precisely such issues .
I found that , contrary to the fears of the critics , most social agendas were advanced rather than handicapped by globalization .
Globalization , I concluded , had a human face .
Take women 's issues , for example :
If you look at what happens to the gender gap on pay inequality , it turns out that you can make a perfectly solid argument that in fact it 's narrowed rather than widened as a result of international trade .
The reason is very simple :
If a man is paid twice as much as a woman , when they are both equally competent , that is inefficient .
So when you are engaged in international competition , you 're really not going to be able to indulge your prejudice in this way .
This will lead to more demand for women and less for men , bringing pressure to bear on their relative wages in the direction of greater pay equality .
Two brilliant young women , Sandra Black and Elizabeth Brainerd , did their dissertation at Harvard on this hypothesis .
They found that in two decades in internationally traded industries in the United States , the gender wage gap narrowed faster than in non-traded industries .
Trade had thus been good for an important social objective , not a drag on it .
reason :
You still hear the argument — President Obama made it during his campaign — that we want fair trade , not free trade .
Bhagwati :
In the United States the phrase " fair trade " holds a lot of sway , because fairness is an important issue here .
In the United States it 's the equality of opportunity , not of outcome , that matters .
We have a fairness - oriented culture .
The Europeans , who are actually more stratified — they 're more into equality of outcome .
The social mobility of people is much less , so they want the state to intervene and redistribute .
They 're more into justice and we 're more into fairness .
So if you want to be a protectionist in the U.S. , you 've got to say that these Japanese or these Indians are trading unfairly .
People will much more readily give you protection if they think the other guy is a wicked unfair trader .
President Obama has n't really understood the case for free trade because I do n't think he 's been too interested in trade .
His background is as an activist working with the poor people , so he has n't thought about these issues .
So he ends up listening to other people , and a lot of people who are protectionist are around him , particularly the unions , who are afraid of international competition .
But they dress up the fair trade argument in altruism , that they 're doing it to raise the labor standards and wages of workers in India and Brazil and so on and so forth , when in fact , they 're doing it to protect their own workers from competition .
The president does n't seem to realize that this is something which other people , whom you pretend you 're trying to help , actually see as a naked , cynical ploy .
Instead of pandering to union fear , Obama has got to engage them .
You have got to help these doubting Thomases confront their fears .
He 's got to say that trade with the poor countries is actually helping , not hurting , you .
The unions ' main fear is that unskilled jobs are disappearing .
They see these jobs being taken up elsewhere where the labor is cheap .
But they can't hold onto these jobs anyway .
What they get in return from trade are cheap products that they need as consumers .
So free trade moderates the downward pressure on their real wages .
Big portions of the wages of poor workers go toward low quality textiles , for instance .
That is well - established .
But if you look at the structure of protectionism , if you go and buy something from Anne Klein that 's going to be expensive , but it carries no tariff at all because these high - end designers compete on variety .
Tariffs matter where the competition is on prices .
So the low - quality items which poor people buy end up carrying higher tariffs than high - end items that rich people buy .
reason :
So free trade 's harm to union workers as producers is minimal , but the harm to them as consumers would be very great if we did n't have free trade ?
Bhagwati : Yes .
So what President Obama has to do is basically change the ethos in this country so that it understands that the United States has profited enormously from free trade .
Free trade has rescued India and China from poverty , yes .
But the U.S. working class has also profited from international trade .
He 's got to make an eloquent case like that .
He 's got to see that this is something that needs as much attention and as much of his eloquence as the speech he made on race after he got into trouble over his pastor .
But then to move the case of free trade forward , the Obama administration has to show global leadership , because the U.S. is the biggest trading country .
He has got to make sure that the stimulus package and everything that he does is completely consistent with openness .
I think he's got to understand this is not something he can keep postponing and postponing .
When President Clinton came in the first year , he was into Japan bashing and he had n't made up his mind on whether he wanted trade or not , because he had advisors on both sides .
So his first year was extremely tentative .
Then he made up his mind and was fiercely pro-trade after that .
President Bush , the junior , he too gave into steel tariffs when he first came in , but after the first year , when he found his feet , he was very pro-trade .
President Obama does n't have that luxury because the weaknesses are showing in the way the stimulus is being designed and played out .
So someone has to tell him very clearly that he does n't have the luxury of most presidents , which is to use a first year to find your feet on trade .
He 's got to be out there and he 's got to provide the leadership .
He 's got to bring in the people who waiver and dither , the AFL - CIO , the Democrats who are indebted to the AFL - CIO , and say : " Look , you 're wrong .
Here , let 's have a debate . "
There are lots of Democratic economists who'd be able to engage these guys in a proper debate .
reason :
In recent years , the opposition to free trade has n't just come from left - wing unions , but also people on the right who fear that outsourcing will cause the U.S. to lose its economic edge as it imports high - value - added products and exports low - value - added ones .
How do you respond to that ?
Bhagwati :
It 's an irrelevant argument .
To say that the United States should be exporting high - value items rather than low - value items is itself a fallacy .
But America 's great comparative advantage lies in innovation .
For someone like me who has come from India it is very obvious that this country is full of innovators .
When I was a student I read about Britain 's Industrial Revolution .
And it was powered by all kinds of people , inventing the spinning jenny and so on .
They were like little Americans , you know , thinking of new ways of doing things and making a buck .
Almost every other American I know is thinking about something , some way to do something .
We are a highly inventive people , and technology therefore is our driving force .
It 's not savings and investments which are driving our productivity .
It 's technology and innovation and immigrants like me — not me in particular — lots of people who come here and by the second generation go through the mill and become Colin Powell or Orlando Patterson at Harvard .
Nobody can compete with us in the long run , in my view , because these are not advantages which people in traditional societies can reproduce .
So we 're always going to be doing high value .
We 'll lose the high value we generate to others quickly because now technology diffuses very fast .
But then we 'll have new ideas , new technologies .
reason :
Which side poses the bigger threat to free trade , conservatives on sovereignty , neo- mercantilist grounds , or liberals on equity and environmental grounds ?
Bhagwati :
In the U.S. , I think the Democrats are the biggest threat to free trade .
I do n't see the right - wing threat to globalization in terms of sovereignty as being a major one , frankly .
Conservatives are principled people , so they have Edmund Burke type of reservations about continuous change and so on .
But they are not people who are going to undermine the rule of law when it comes to trade .
Even their arguments against immigration are rule - of - law arguments .
Anti-globalization noises saying we 've lost our sovereignty and so on and so forth , it 's not going to get very far in the U.S. system .
The threat from the left , on the other hand , is much more serious because they oppose free trade on equity grounds .
I love America .
I have settled in it .
But there is a tendency , particularly on the part of the Democrats , to become totally self - righteous on everything and this is the way it has to be and if you disagree , then you 're a Republican .
I mean , that 's the way they argue it .
It 's unbelievable .
They do n't want to argue the merits of the case .
reason :
Why do you think Republicans are better on free trade than Democrats ?
Bhagwati : Both the last Bush and Ronald Reagan believed in America .
They thought that their own people could win .
That made them more prone to accept international competition and trade .
They carried that attitude over into politics , of course .
For instance , President Reagan won the Cold War by pushing Gorbachev to the limit .
But he was lucky .
President Bush went into Iraq with the same attitude , and that was unfortunate .
But since they both believed that Americans would win , they were good on international trade , although maybe for the wrong reasons .
Democrats do n't believe that America can remain number one , and hence they cannot bring themselves to be completely in favor of open markets .
reason :
You are a big believer in multilateral trade agreements over bilateral trade agreements .
What 's wrong with bilateral trade agreements ?
Bhagwati : Free trade agreements and protectionism are two sides of the same coin .
When I have free trade just with you , I 'm freeing trade with you but I handicap those who are not members of our free trade area .
They have to keep paying the duties to get into our markets .
So that becomes a de facto way of increasing protection against outsiders .
Multilateral free trade would be a closer thing to pure free trade .
But there are two additional worries about bilateral trade agreements :
One , we do n't just have two or three free trade agreements .
Today there are close to 500 , and every week there 's another new one being constructed .
As a result , you 're getting all kinds of special tariffs , rules of origin , and other things multiplying in the system , something which I 've called the spaghetti bowl .
Exporters rightly get upset by the large numbers of tariffs they face depending on where you 're coming from .
Two , how do you enforce these agreements in a globalized world ?
It 's very chaotic .
Parts are coming from everywhere .
For a country to have to then decide which product is my partner country 's product rather than an outside country 's product becomes completely arbitrary .
A car produced in Canada with Japanese steel and German chemicals , where 80 or 90 percent of the parts may come from elsewhere — is that a Canadian car or is it really something else ?
Does it qualify for the zero tariff under the North American Free Trade Agreement or not ?
reason : Was NAFTA a mistake ?
Bhagwati : I think in retrospect , yes .
It 's not a slam dunk argument because it did bring in Mexico .
Otherwise , they were talking about CAFTA which included just Canada and the U.S.
But when you brought in Mexico , it made it a much bigger thing .
President Clinton was carrying on the multilateral negotiations in tandem with NAFTA .
But NAFTA created worries on the part of the unions here , because this is a poor country and they were worried that Mexican competition would really hurt their wages .
So even though the multilateral talks would 've gone through without any difficulty , President Clinton ended up having to fight very hard for NAFTA , which survived by a very narrow majority .
In order to win NAFTA , he had to give in on things like labor standards and so on .
That 's when all these social things became part of trade deals .
From there , it never looked back .
So in retrospect , I would say , because of the concessions they had to make , Clinton started us down a road which really has been counterproductive .
There is another thing to worry about .
When you look at a trade agreement like NAFTA , it 's about that thick ( holds his hands about two feet apart ) .
When I debate people like Lori Wallach of Public Citizen , she arrives with a lot of books , and among them is this NAFTA treaty she carries for effect .
I hope she gets a hernia from doing this often enough , because it looks pretty heavy to me .
I would n't be carrying it around .
Anyway , she shows this book and asks , " Is this free trade ? "
And mad as she is , she 's right to raise that issue .
You should be able to say maybe in 10 pages that in these sectors we are going to liberalize and so on .
But nine - tenths of what 's in these agreements are things which have nothing to do with trade .
Labor standards , environmental standards , intellectual property rights .
If I were Jane Fonda , in order to sell more workout tapes , I could put into the agreement a clause that the president of Mexico has to do his exercise to my tapes .
And it would go in , because ours is a lobbying culture and nobody really would know that it 's there .
Because who opens these things except the lobbyists ?
So many developing countries are now waking up to the fact that they 're being sold a bill of goods in the form of trade agreements .
reason :
Do you think a global externality problem like global warming poses a fundamental threat to free trade ?
Bhagwati : I think it depends on the way you do it .
First , you 've got to decide whether there is a problem of an externality .
I have doubts about these scientists who claim to have a consensus on global warming because , you know , Freeman Dyson , a great scientific figure , says these guys are really low - level scientists and I 'm told by many that they , in fact , are .
And if they reach a consensus , I do n't care .
I mean , that 's the consensus of incompetents .
But so long as only the scientists were talking about global warming , nobody paid the slightest attention .
Remember , not a single senator voted for the Kyoto resolution back in the '90s .
Even Al Gore and Clinton had to walk away from Kyoto .
But then the polar bears were threatened , the glaciers began to melt , and then that great French film about the penguins which touched all our hearts came out .
So these were three whammies .
Even if you live in Peoria you will understand , wrongly maybe , that global warming is a problem .
I tell all my students :
If they think of something like that for free trade , please let me know .
What countries like India and China are saying is that if the CO2 was accumulating and it's going to create a disaster , then that took a lot of time to establish .
So they want the West to bear primary responsibility for the damage it has caused in the past .
If America applies some kind of a carbon tax and it says that if India and China do n't impose a similar tax , it 's going to use what is called border tax adjustment , then that is protectionism .
And there 's no reason why Indians and Chinese have to accept this .
Just as America was not willing to accept it when it did n't sign onto Kyoto and Europe started threatening a countervailing duty on American exports .
But everybody reacted to that talk and said this is a cockeyed thing to do .
Peter Mandelson , who was the EU Commissioner , said it was very unwise because the United States will retaliate .
It 's ironic that we are now using exactly that kind of threat on India and China .
But America 's fuel tax is so much lower than that of most other countries , except the Middle East .
So India and China are going to hit us because we had a low gas tax for a long time .
And all hell would break loose .
India and China are big guys .
They can get legal [ World Trade Organization ] retaliation against the U.S. Or India could take away contracts from Boeing and give them to Air France .
It can have nuclear reactors go to France rather than to G.E. Caterpillar would be shut out .
So I suggest a different way .
If in our own U.S. system you 're going to get your companies to clean up under the Superfund Act , that 's a tort principle which we accept .
Then we ought to be willing to pay in some form to other poor countries for the past damages .
The West has completely ignored this suggestion so far .
It has provided maybe a few million dollars in assistance to Third World countries for this purpose .
But if the West seriously starts contributing to this fund , Third World countries could get anywhere from $ 150 million to $ 1 billion to mitigate global warming .
reason :
This is a political non-starter , you know .
Bhagwati : Yes .
But the president actually has made some remarks about border tax adjustments not being such a good idea .
He 's got to do more than that .
He 's got to say this is a crazy thing to do .
He 's still very cool — he needs to lose his temper once in a while .
Because it 's too important .
The U.S. is one of the biggest trading nations in the world .
We want the rule of law .
We do n't want retaliation , which would be massive .
India and China are not Zaire or Zimbabwe .
They 're not little countries you can push around .
We do n't want to unleash that kind of trade war , because it would be very hard to control , I 'm afraid .
I was fortunate to attend Olin College of Engineering with some of the brightest minds in the country , and the bar of achievement was set high .
Inside the classroom , we worked on problems that were mind - numbingly complex and intricate .
Outside of class , most students aimed to develop incredibly elaborate and technically innovative projects :
Robots that swam across a pool like a tuna fish , machines that harvested oranges from a grove , or a new design for a surgical device .
The projects I chose to work on during my time as an undergraduate were high - risk / high - reward .
I spent many nights using the Electron Scanning Microscope to image the nanostructure of Neluma Nucifera ( the common Lilly pad ) .
I was attempting to exploit its nanostructure to construct a material with microsuction properties .
It almost worked .
I spent another 6 months of free time experimenting with Ferromagnetic fluid ( aka " ferrofluid " ) , a magical substance that comes to life in the presence of a magnetic field .
I wanted to stabilize ferrofluid in a clear liquid carrier , so it could be used in lavalamp - type environments to delight consumers at Brookstone .
I built a make - shift lab in my parent 's basement , borrowed a micropipette from a scientist friend and went at it .
I learned a great deal from these ( and many other ) projects .
My time at Olin was highly enjoyable , transformative experience and I was given ample resources to explore my intellectual and creative limits .
I learned more rapidly than any other point in my life .
There was really only one downside .
My experience in school lead me to believe that to be successful , you had to do non-obvious , difficult things .
After being immersed in such a high achievement , intellectually stimulating environment , it is easy to believe you must invent an anti-gravity device or equivalent , in order to succeed .
This is a self - inflicted expectation that many students place on themselves after years of being subject to the incredibly sophisticated minds of their professors .
I believe this mindset can have counter - productive consequences .
Although I endorse those who attempt to spend their time defying gravity ( the world needs these people ) , I simply think students simply forget that the real world is not graded by professors with untamed beards .
Students are largely unaware that they could realize just as much success , or perhaps even more success , if they point their incisive intellect at simpler , " stupider " problems .
So why do n't they ?
Because these problems are typically unsexy , considered to lack academic rigor .
I once met a man that made over $ 1,000,000 / year selling bowling balls on the Internet .
I asked him how he had built such a fantastic business .
I was looking for this guy 's secret sauce .
Was he a marketing guru , a tenacious entrepreneur that did n't give up , saw an opportunity earlier than most ?
None of the above .
He was an average guy , with below average technical skills .
He hired 2 kids to work out of his garage to build his website .
If he can do it , so can I ....
It 's two years later , and I now make a decent sum of money selling TV Wall Mounts on the Internet .
This is an area I can proudly say all of my fellow over - achievers have overlooked .
But do n't fret .
The world is full of more stupid things to do .
The truth is , any endeavor , no matter how seemingly trivial , can benefit from an incisive mind taking a good , hard look .
And almost any endeavor can be intellectually gratifying .
You may be surprised to know that most people do n't apply scientific method to their efforts , or even possess the reasoning skills or patience to achieve greatness .
This puts you and your well - honed cerebral apparatus , at an incredible advantage .
In the real world , you 're no longer competing with your fellow geniuses at the school science fair ... you 're competing with your typical neighbor .
And you 're about to kick his ( metaphorical ) ass .
In high school , I founded a web development studio that carved out a niche making interactive websites with Macromedia Flash .
It made my friend and I the richest ( but unfortunately not also the coolest ) kids in class .
But what if instead of making incredibly impressive , expensive Flash websites for our clients , we deferred revenue and focused on making free online Flash greeting cards ?
We may have built Blue Mountain Greeting Cards , a year or so before they did .
Free greeting cards ?
That 's so easy it 's stupid .
I 'll end with perhaps the most outrageous example .
It is the story of a middle - America teenager who created an incredibly annoying online video series called Fred Figglehorn , and publishes it on YouTube .
In the series , Fred talks about his days at school , his alcoholic mother , and his crush Judy .
Fred 's annoying voice has reached millions of people around the world .
He 's created a viral phenomenon ... and his endorsements and ad revenue have already paid for college ( if he decides to go ) .
Success is n't only found in the complex , intellectual achievements .
Sometimes it 's found in more obvious , less sexy places .
Go find something stupid to do .

( CNN ) --
In the 1980s , it was easy to dismiss the accordion - toting " Weird Al " Yankovic as a one - joke wonder .
Sure , the joke was funny .
Those song parodies , such as " Eat It " or " I Lost on Jeopardy " ?
Clever , as were the note - perfect videos for them that played constantly on MTV .
( Occasionally , Yankovic would take over the channel , rechristening it " AlTV . " )
But how long could it last ?
Devotion to song parodies was the stuff of teenage boys , not serious musicians or Top 40 hitmakers .
Sooner or later , Yankovic 's time would be up , and he 'd end up back in the rack with Dickie Goodman or Buckner & Garcia .
" I never expected to make a living at this when I was growing up .
My whole career is pretty much by accident , " he said from New York .
Twenty - five years later , the joke 's on us .
And it 's still funny .
Yankovic , now a 30 - year veteran of the music business , recently issued " The Essential ' Weird Al ' Yankovic " ( Way Moby / Volcano / Legacy ) , two full discs of spot - on parody and original musical humor .
( It 's not the first time Yankovic 's material has been gathered on a best - of ; there was a four - disc boxed set back in 1994 . )
The parodies include the early hits -- the Michael Jackson spoof " Eat It , " the Madonna send - up " Like a Surgeon " ( which was suggested by the Material Girl herself ) -- on through recent entries such as the Green Day parody " Canadian Idiot " and Yankovic 's biggest chart hit , 2006 's " White & Nerdy , " the latter a take - off of Chamillionaire 's " Ridin ' . "
" It 's certainly ironic considering that my genre is by and large the domain of one - hit wonders , and I 've outlasted many of the artists that I 've parodied over the years , " he observed with a touch of wonder .
Yankovic owes his start to comedy - mining DJ Dr. Demento , who took a taped submission by the then - high school student and put it on the air .
Eventually , Yankovic decided to give music a full - time shot , despite architecture studies at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo .
It 's been mostly success since then .
Besides the hits , Yankovic 's starred in a movie ( the cult favorite " UHF " ) and a television show ( " The Weird Al Show " ) and established himself as a video director .
Musicians , whom Yankovic consults before recording a send - up , generally treat a Weird Al song as a tribute .
" The list of people that have turned me down is actually pretty small , " Yankovic said .
" The only person who has consistently said no is Prince . "
( He has had his run-ins with the suits ; Atlantic Records said he could n't release " You 're Pitiful , " a parody of James Blunt 's " You 're Beautiful , " despite Blunt 's approval ; Yankovic retaliated by insulting Atlantic in a video and putting out the song as a free download . )
If Yankovic has a challenge these days , it 's finding songs worth parodying .
He admires music from a variety of genres , but the splintering of the Top 40 audience has made it harder to find a tune everybody recognizes .
" One of the hardest things to do nowadays is even trying to define what a hit is .
Just because it 's a hit on one particular radio station does n't mean it's a mainstream hit , " he said .
But he likes rap 's bounty of language -- " There are a lot of words to play with .
A lot of pop songs are either very repetitive or do n't give you a lot of material " -- and figures that pop will change again and provide more opportunities .
Besides , it comes down to the humor , he adds .
" Thankfully , one of my creeds is that my songs need to be funny and enjoyable even if you 're not familiar with the original source material , " he said .
If the source material should fail him , there 's always the accordion .
Indeed , Yankovic has given the much - maligned instrument a leading role on his recordings , usually on polka - flavored ditties .
Asked whether there 's a possibility of teaming with They Might Be Giants ' accordionist John Linnell and polka master Jimmy Sturr , Yankovic chuckles .
Could " Monsters of Polka " be in his future ?
" No talk as far as I know , but that sounds like a fun project , " he said .
Apple , which declined to comment on the case , is known for taking an aggressive approach to trademark protection .
It was involved in a long - running legal dispute with Apple Corps , the company set up by The Beatles to managed their interests , over the use of the Apple name .
Kino Video continues to put out sets devoted to the preservation of early avant - garde cinema .
Volume 3 just came out , and , on YouTube , I managed to stumble across one of its more intriguing offerings .
Directed by silent film - makers James Sibley Watson and Alec Wilder , Tomato Is Another Day ( 1930 ) featured an acting style that emphasized a flatness that was both weirdly druggy and overtly explanatory .
This was , of course , all by design .
Watson and Wilder hatched TIAD as way of mocking the hyper-verbosity of the then - faddish “ talkies ” that were poised to sweep aside the expressive , gesture - based film - making of the silent era .
Tim Kretschmer killed himself after the shootings
The father of a German teenager who went on a shooting spree in March , killing 15 people , has been charged with manslaughter .
Tim Kretschmer , 17 , took his father 's pistol and burst into his former school in Winnenden , near Stuttgart , opening fire , before killing himself .
His father has now been charged with 15 counts of manslaughter for failing to keep his gun secure .
Prosecutors said he had " negligently " stored weapons and bullets .
Kretschmer used his father 's legally - registered pistol to kill eight schoolgirls , a schoolboy and three teachers at Albertville secondary school on 11 March .
Quantity of ammunition
He then commandeered a car and killed two more people in the town of Wendlingen , 40 km ( 25 miles ) away before he shot himself as police approached .
His father Joerg had legally kept more than a dozen weapons in his house .
Prosecutors said his father had " negligently made possible the actions of his son in that he stored the weapons ... in such a way that Tim could get his hands on a gun and a large amount of ammunition . "
He has been charged with 15 counts of manslaughter , 13 counts of grievous bodily harm and breaking gun laws , the prosecution said .
In mid-November , Alexi Giannoulias held a Sunday - morning news conference at Flashpoint Academy , a digital - arts school in the Loop , to announce that he was being endorsed for the U.S. Senate by Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky .
It was n't a surprising development —
Schakowsky has been a mentor and a key ally to Giannoulias since his political debut in 2006 , when he ran successfully for state treasurer — but the event was choreographed as if it were big news .
Campaign workers greeted people in the lobby and directed them to the elevators a few steps away ; others waited to catch them as they stepped off the elevators on the fifth floor .
Dozens of chairs were set up in the room where the announcement was to be made , and a video camera was ready to capture it for YouTube .
By a few minutes past 11:30 , the scheduled start time , about 20 of Giannoulias 's supporters had assembled , including the campaign staffers and his mother .
But the only media who'd shown up were me and a couple cameramen from local TV stations .
In strode a smiling Schakowsky and Cook County commissioner Larry Suffredin , followed by Giannoulias , a six - two , 33 - year - old former basketball player and banking exec .
His hair was fashionably mussed as usual , but he wore a conservative dark suit — American flag pin on the lapel — and a look of deliberate seriousness .
After Suffredin introduced Schakowsky , she stepped to the podium and reminded everyone that she 'd been one of Giannoulias 's first backers .
Since then , she said , he'd shown that he had the " courage " to " stand up " to special interests , health insurance companies , and greedy banks — just what was needed in Congress .
" I think he is by far and away the best candidate to retain President Obama 's seat , " Schakowsky said .
In touching on America 's newfound suspicion of the banking industry , Schakowsky inadvertently highlighted the issue that 's played a far bigger role in Giannoulias 's campaign than his positions on health care reform , job creation , or financial regulation : his family 's business , Broadway Bank .
Four years ago Giannoulias was a 29 - year - old officer at the bank , and known in political circles — if at all — as the guy who'd helped Barack Obama raise lots of money in the Greek community .
Then Obama paid Giannoulias back , endorsing him in TV spots that propelled him to a come - from - behind win in the 2006 Democratic primary for treasurer .
Victory transformed him into a promising young progressive with big prospects — until the media began reporting that Broadway Bank had given a series of loans to figures involved in organized crime or political corruption .
Even as Giannoulias triumphed in the 2006 general election , critics accused him of being inexperienced , slick , and " ethically challenged . "
Now , after serving as treasurer for less than three years , Giannoulias thinks he 's ready to move up to the Senate , and Schakowsky ( whom some progressives wish were running in his stead ) is one of dozens of elected officials and union leaders saying yes he can .
The stakes are high : Democrats can't lose a single Senate seat next year and keep their filibuster - proof majority , and the office Obama held before he was elected president would be a prize for the Republicans .
There 's little doubt what the biggest issues are : voters are angry and distressed about the economy , and , to a lesser extent , waste and corruption in government .
While Giannoulias and his campaign team are betting that his progressive politics , reform efforts in the treasurer 's office , and ideas for creating jobs will resonate , his opponents are talking a lot about Broadway Bank 's aggressive lending policies and trying to force Giannoulias to talk about them too .
They 'd like nothing better than to turn his candidacy into a referendum on the high - risk growth strategies that propelled the banking industry toward catastrophe .
Once Schakowsky was through , Giannoulias stepped to the podium , looked directly into the cameras , and praised her in a gracious tone that sounded less like political backslapping than a polite thank - you to the aunt who sent you a new basketball for your birthday .
Then his warmth gave way to a cool , controlled indignation as he took a couple swipes at the opposition .
To capture the Democratic nomination on February 2 , he needs to beat former Chicago inspector general David Hoffman , Chicago Urban League president Cheryle Robinson Jackson , and attorney Jacob Meister , but Giannoulias , the leader in polls , name recognition , and fund - raising , apparently believed he had the luxury of ignoring them .
He fired away instead at Republican front - runner Mark Kirk .
Democrats believe they can portray the North Shore congressman as an erstwhile moderate who 's abandoning " working families " as he shifts to the right , and Giannoulias noted that Kirk had accepted more than $ 320,000 in campaign contributions from insurers .
" If you pay your premiums your insurance company should cover you — no exceptions , no caps , no limits , " Giannoulias said .
" Mark Kirk disagrees .
He believes in protecting insurance companies , not protecting people . "
Giannoulias thanked everyone for coming .
As the cameramen packed up , he was loose and jovial , circulating around the room offering handshakes and hugs and making wisecracks .
For once , nobody had asked about the bank .
Giannoulias 's father , Alexis , immigrated to Chicago from Greece in 1961 , when he was 26 , and married his wife , Anna , also Greek , seven years later .
He sold pickles and took on other odd jobs before finding a niche in real estate as a developer of banquet halls and neighborhood shopping centers .
In 1979 he founded Broadway Bank .
The institution grew quickly , lending first to neighborhood businesses and then to commercial real estate developers around the country .
By 2001 it had about $ 335 million in assets and was ranked one of the fastest - growing community banks in the Chicago area .
The family also ran a real estate business , United Investors .
Alexi was born in 1976 , the third of three boys .
He says he practically grew up in the bank , hanging around the office as a kid and working there in the summer and on breaks during high school and college .
Like his older brothers , Alexi attended the prestigious Latin School , where he developed into a star guard on the high school basketball team , known for his three - point shot .
He wanted to play college ball .
" I was small and slow , so I thought maybe I could play in the Ivy League , " he says .
" But I 'm really close to my family , and my mom got cancer that year and I decided to stay home and be near her . "
He enrolled at the University of Chicago and became one of the basketball team 's scoring leaders .
But as his mother got better , Giannoulias started thinking about how much he wanted to play in the Division I NCAA tournament , which he'd watched avidly every year since he was a little kid .
( " The first championship I remember is when Keith Smart hit the jumper to win it for Indiana " in 1987 , he says . )
His older brother George was already in Boston , so Alexi got in touch with the coach at Boston University and decided to transfer there for his last two years .
It worked out as he'd hoped : Giannoulias got a lot less playing time than he had at the U. of C. , but during his junior year the Terriers went 25 - 4 and won the American East Conference tournament before losing in the first round of the NCAAs to Tulsa .
After graduating in 1998 , Alexi played pro ball for a year in Greece , then enrolled in law school at Tulane .
His JD in hand , he returned to Chicago and took a job as a loan officer at Broadway Bank .
Within two years he'd been named senior loan officer and a bank vice president .
It 's not clear what responsibilities came with these titles .
He 's said that as VP he oversaw all of Broadway 's lending — but he's also said he was really just the guy who serviced the bank 's loans — overseeing things like billing and payment collection — while more senior officers , including his older brother Demetris , negotiated the deals and made the final decisions .
When I pressed him to specify his job descriptions at each stage of his employment at the bank , he laughed .
" You have to understand that it was the family business — I did everything there , " he said .
" Sometimes I was a teller and sometimes I serviced loans — whatever we needed . "
Banking industry experts say banks used to put employees through a couple years of training before giving them the responsibility of making loan decisions .
" It was a standard — you would be trained and then you would be mentored in different parts of the bank before being sent out as a loan officer , " says Michael Iannaccone , president of MDI Investments , an Oak Park - based banking consulting firm .
But banks started relaxing that standard during the real estate boom earlier this decade .
Broadway was one of hundreds of banks around the country that profited greatly from that boom and kept it going with aggressive lending policies .
From 2002 through 2006 its assets more than doubled , from $ 434 million to $ 946 million , and Crain 's Chicago Business ranked it the most profitable bank in Illinois ( by figuring its income as a percentage of its assets ) for four years running .
" People think there 's some kind of magic to it , " Alexi told Crain 's in 2004 .
In fact , he said , it was simply the result of hard work and his father 's deep roots in the community .
" He knows what deals are solid or not solid , what areas are hot or not hot . "
But there was at least one additional factor : risk tolerance .
Broadway 's growth and profits were fueled largely by its rapidly expanding business in issuing loans for new real estate development .
Traditionally lending for construction and development ( known in the industry as C & D ) has been seen as a bigger gamble than lending for , say , existing homes or small businesses , since a relatively high number of plans for new hotels , condos , housing developments , office complexes , and the like end up flopping .
In the early to mid-2000s , though , as the soaring real estate markets drove the national economy , many lenders downplayed the risk and dived in .
At the end of 2002 , Alexi 's first year as a full - time employee , the bank had nearly $ 80 million in outstanding C & D loans — about 25 percent of its total loan portfolio , according to records filed with the FDIC .
By the end of 2006 , not long after he'd left the bank , it had $ 356 million in C & D loans accounting for nearly 46 percent of its loan total .
During those years , it was consistently among the 20 banks , out of hundreds its size , with the biggest share of their portfolios tied up in such loans .
Moreover , rather than relying primarily on depositors from the community for its lending money , the bank relied heavily on brokered deposits , or " hot money " — pots of money collected by brokers from investors around the country .
Over the last decade scores of banks have used brokered deposits to quickly bolster their cash supplies — but at a cost .
These deposits command higher interest rates ; furthermore , the depositors are less likely to stick with the bank if they see they can do better somewhere else .
" When properly managed , BDs offer institutions a number of important benefits such as ready access to funding , " the FDIC notes on its Web site .
" However , BDs can be a higher - cost and more volatile funding source and , as such , present potential liquidity , earnings , and other risks that must be properly managed . "
In 2002 , the ratio of brokered deposits to total assets at Broadway was 53 percent , according to FDIC records ; four years later , it had risen to 68 percent .
The average for all federally insured banks nationwide was 4.5 percent .
According to an explanation of hot money on AOL's Daily Finance in July , " the 79 U.S. bank failures in the last two years had four times the brokered deposits of the average bank , and 33 percent of the failed banks had high brokered deposits and extremely fast growth . "
In the early and middle part of the decade , when the economy was thriving , this just meant that Broadway had money to lend .
Giannoulias says that it was able to aid countless small businesses and enable important development projects to get off the ground .
" We 've taken enormous pride in helping people , " he says , naming a neighborhood health store and a nail salon .
" We have people who 've had checking accounts for 25 or 30 years . "
But experts and community leaders say Broadway developed a reputation for giving out loans to just about anyone who walked in the door .
Among the recipients of loans while Alexi worked full - time at the bank were : Michael Giorango , a Florida developer who 's been convicted of running bookmaking and prostitution rings ; Boris and Lev Stratievsky , a father - son team later convicted of laundering money for Ukrainian drug dealers ; and Tony Rezko , the developer - businessman - political fixer who was eventually convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role in pay - to - play schemes during the administration of Governor Blagojevich .
Giannoulias and current bank officials have said all of them were creditworthy when the loans were issued .
Another loan , for $ 1 million , was issued in 2002 to a woman whose family claims she was suffering from dementia — and that both Alexi , as the loan officer , and his brother Demetris , then the bank 's CFO , knew it but gave her the loan anyway .
Loren Billings was persuaded by three tenants of her building at 1134 W. Washington to take out the loan so she could invest in a foreign - currency arbitrage account .
But bank officials had misgivings .
They first requested that she provide additional financial records beyond what she 'd initially submitted with her loan application .
Then , in a letter to Billings dated September 16 , 2002 , Alexi suggested that she consult an attorney before signing the loan papers .
" The hiring of an attorney is not a requirement , " he wrote .
But " it is important that you understand all of the intricacies of the loan documents and more importantly that you are fully aware of the potential risks involved with any non-payment or late payment of the loan .
Secondly , there is concern on the bank 's part due to the past credit history of the other three co-borrowers . "
Alexi Giannoulias
Billings provided the backup financial records , some of which contradicted information she 'd already submitted , according to court records .
But when she did n't heed Alexi 's advice to get a lawyer , bank officials took the names of her tenants off the loan and issued it to her alone , listing her building — which included her home as well as the Museum of Holography , which she 'd founded in the 70s — as collateral .
" Despite my warning , Ms. Billings was determined to go through with the loan , and there was no reason to deny it , " Alexi wrote in a 2006 letter to the Sun - Times , responding to a story about the loan .
Billings turned over most of the money to her tenants and saw no return on her investment .
When Billings 's son , Terrence Kasprzak , sued the bank in 2006 , Alexi intimated that Kasprzak was just trying to capitalize on his campaign for treasurer .
" Why is Kasprzak suddenly voicing concerns about his mother 's mental capacity four years after the loan was granted and when I 'm currently seeking a statewide office ? " he wondered .
A Cook County judged ruled in favor of the bank in March 2008 ; Kasprzak appealed and the suit is currently pending in state appellate court .
At the time these loans generated little attention , and the bank continued to make headlines for its success .
In 2006 it was the fifth - most profitable community bank in the country , and on the surface its management decisions appeared to be sound .
Loans that had " gone bad , " meaning those with payments at least 90 days past due , did n't make up even half a percent of the total value of its portfolio — and the bank had reserves on hand to cover them .
Like hundreds of other profitable banks , it saw no reason to change its loan or deposit strategy .
Yet Iannaccone , the banking consultant , thinks it should have proceeded with caution .
" Even in 2006 and 2005 everyone knew that real estate was n't going to keep going up 10 percent a year , " he says .
" And they were in high - risk loans . "
In 1998 Giannoulias met state senator Barack Obama playing pickup basketball at the University of Chicago rec center .
In addition to Obama 's competitive fire ( " He 'll stack the teams so he's with the winner , " he says ) , Giannoulias says he was impressed by Obama 's smarts , friendliness , and passion .
The two became friends , hoops buddies , and , most significantly , political allies .
Five years later , when Giannoulias moved back to town to work at the bank , Obama was getting ready to run for the U.S. Senate .
That April incumbent Peter Fitzgerald , a Republican whose aloofness and independence alienated colleagues in both parties , announced that he would n't run for reelection .
With the Republican Party already reeling from corruption scandals under former governor George Ryan , Democrats believed the seat was theirs to reclaim .
But Obama was not the favored candidate .
His last attempt to move up the political ladder , in a 2000 congressional primary , had ended in a crushing defeat , and the declared candidates in the Democratic primary for the Senate seat included state comptroller Dan Hynes , son of 19th Ward political boss Tom Hynes ; Blair Hull , a billionaire businessman willing to spend whatever it took ; Gery Chico , a lawyer who'd formerly served as school board president and chief of staff to Mayor Daley ; and Maria Pappas , the quirky Cook County treasurer who was counting on tapping the loyal Greek business community for resources .
Still , the Obama campaign believed he could win on charisma , intelligence , and opposition to the war in Iraq — if he could only raise enough money to let people know who he was .
Giannoulias believed that too .
Friends say he talked up Obama long before there was any buzz about him .
" I remember people asking him , ' Wait , who is this Barack guy ? ' " says Sean Conlon , a Chicago - based real estate developer and consultant .
" He came back to town and got interested in this Obama phenomenon , " adds county assessor Jim Houlihan , who 's known Giannoulias since he was in high school , where he was buddies with Houlihan 's son .
" It reminded me of Kennedy — he grabbed my generation like Obama grabbed this one . "
Giannoulias did n't just go around saying nice things about Obama — he raised money for him .
He introduced him to donors in the Greek community , starting with his own family .
Alexis Giannoulias hardly had a record of supporting liberal Democrats — he'd donated to the campaign of former Republican governor George Ryan and the National Republican Campaign Committee — but at his son's behest he contributed $ 2,000 to Obama 's Senate bid .
Alexi 's brother George kicked in another $ 2,000 , and Alexi himself added $ 5,600 .
On top of that , Alexi hosted fund - raisers and made contacts that netted Obama 's campaign another $ 100,000 .
Obama , of course , went on to victory in the primary , delivered the electrifying keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention , and in the fall coasted to a general election victory .
By that time Giannoulias had the political bug .
" Barack taught me that if smart , capable people want to get into politics they can make a difference , " he says .
Obama appears to have politicized Giannoulias .
He 'd never run for anything , never been a member of a political organization , never worked on a campaign .
" He was n't very public at all until he started to run for office , " says a north - side community activist who did n't want to be named because of ongoing relationships with Giannoulias 's family and Broadway Bank .
" He did n't go to any community events .
He had no policy experience .
Then all the sudden he started talking about public service . "
But Giannoulias had some advantages .
He was bright , he had people skills , he had money , and through the bank he already had some political connections .
Secretary of state Jesse White and alderman Walter Burnett both had accounts at the bank — as did Obama , for that matter .
His family knew most of the elected officials on the north side and had contributed to a number of their campaign funds — recipients included White , Schakowsky , Blagojevich , state reps Harry Osterman and Dan Burke , Cook County Board president John Stroger , county commissioners Forrest Claypool and Roberto Maldonado ( now alderman of the 26th Ward ) , county Board of Review commissioner Joe Berrios ( now chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party ) , and aldermen Burt Natarus and Manny Flores .
In the fall of 2005 Giannoulias set his sights on the state treasurer 's office , whose Republican incumbent , Judy Baar Topinka , was preparing to run for governor .
Though most of the people who'd held the office did n't have a banking background , Giannoulias figured he could present his as an asset .
The only problem was that state Democratic chairman Michael Madigan had already slated a candidate , Knox County state 's attorney Paul Mangieri .
Giannoulias first asked his family and friends if they 'd back him .
" He sat down with several of us , including his father and brothers — and I was flattered to be part of the group — and he said he wanted to run , " says Conlon .
" I thought he was crazy to get into politics , but it's what he wanted to do .
I 'm not a political creature , but you get this once in a while where people are doing it for the right reasons .
He works hard and he makes time for everybody .
I believe in Alexi . "
Conlon donated at least $ 10,000 ; the family gave or lent the campaign more than $ 2 million .
Giannoulias also reached out to some of the elected officials he and his family had supported .
Schakowsky says she was impressed from their first meeting .
" I always want to know , when young people come to me , if they want to be somebody or if they want to do something , " she says .
" After a 40 - minute conversation I thought he was the kind of guy who really wanted to do something . "
Still , Schakowsky says she was " skeptical " when Giannoulias told her he wanted to run for treasurer .
" A young guy who wants to start out in a statewide office ?
I 've heard that before , " she says .
" But I was just immediately taken with him . "
Schakowsky was so smitten she served as Giannoulias 's political tour guide , taking him with her to events , introducing him around , and offering advice .
" Since he was a novice , I wanted him to be talking to and meeting the right people , " she says .
" I think it 's important for people in positions like mine to be looking for the next generation of leaders . "
Houlihan agreed to endorse him , and so did Flores ; both now boast of being among the first public officials to do so .
Obama 's backing helped Giannoulias win the endorsements of other progressive Dems , such as Jesse Jackson Jr. , who offered to paste photos of the two of them on billboards across the city and south suburbs that he 'd reserved for election season .
On the other end of the spectrum , old - school alderman Richard Mell , who commands one of the most powerful ward organizations in the city , also appeared at a news conference to endorse him .
Giannoulias was fortunate in other ways too .
On top of the money from his family , he raked in thousands of dollars in contributions from real estate developers and Greek business owners , which allowed him to spend amply on TV commercials and mailings .
Plus , Mangieri was a conservative Democrat who opposed abortion and had 12 kids , which did n't resonate with many of the liberal voters who dominate Democratic primaries .
But the single biggest factor in the race was Obama 's willingness to speak out for Giannoulias on the air — at the time , the freshman senator was one of the most popular politicians in the world .
Asked by reporters why he was going to bat for an unknown candidate in a down - ballot office , Obama was frank about wanting to return a favor .
" He was critical for me in terms of reaching out to the Greek community , other ethnic communities in the city , " he said .
" He was there from the start , when people did n't give me a shot . "
In a 30 - second TV spot , Obama praised Giannoulias in a way that seemed far more personal than the typical campaign sound bite .
" He 's one of the most outstanding young men that I could ever hope to meet , " Obama said as the ad showed images of Giannoulias at a desk , apparently hard at work .
" He 's somebody who cares deeply about people .
He got that from his family .
They really exemplify and embody the American dream .
. . .
Alexi Giannoulias — he 's going to be an outstanding treasurer . "
On the stump Giannoulias impressed voters with his energy , personal charm , and ethics proposals , such as his promise that if elected he would accept no contributions from contractors with the treasurer 's office .
Under serious questioning , though , he sometimes faltered .
When the Tribune 's editorial board asked him how he could address the funding shortfall in the state pension system , Giannoulias said he was n't sure .
It did n't matter .
In a Tribune poll conducted on February 8 , he had the support of about 10 percent of registered voters compared with Mangieri's 14 percent .
A month later , after the Obama ad started airing , he had 31 percent to Mangieri's 17 .
On March 21 , 2006 , Giannoulias won the Democratic primary with 62 percent of the vote to Mangieri's 38 percent .
He did n't have much time to celebrate .
Just days before the election , news outlets ran stories about Broadway Bank loans in the 1990s and early 2000s to Giorango , the Florida developer with ties to bookmaking and prostitution — stories prompted by a pre-primary mailer from the Madigan - led state Democratic Party declaring that Giannoulias was " friends " with mobsters .
Giannoulias said privacy laws prohibited him from getting into details , but he noted that there was nothing illegal about the loans .
" We lend money to people who we trust from a business standpoint , " he said at a news conference .
" We 're a safe and sound financial institution and we run a good business . "
He added that these loans were irrelevant to his campaign — he'd been in law school when they were issued .
That was true — but Giannoulias himself had overseen a couple of loans to Giorango in 2005 , and the Tribune soon dug up records of those .
The paper reported that one of those loans had been used to take out a mortgage on a marina in South Carolina that was home to a casino boat .
One of the companies with a stake in the boat had been led by a Greek immigrant named Konstantinos Boulis , who 'd been murdered in an apparent hit in 2001 .
The company was then sold to investors that included Jack Abramoff , the Washington lobbyist convicted on federal corruption charges in June 2006 , before being sold back to Boulis 's nephew , Spiros Naos — who had donated $ 5,000 to Giannoulias 's campaign in December 2005 .
But the campaign had returned the check in February , when the Daily Herald had written about Naos 's connection to Abramoff .
Forced to concede that he'd met Giorango and checked out some of his properties in Florida , Giannoulias continued to downplay his involvement in the loans , saying he 'd merely done the paperwork and credit evaluation .
" I do n't cultivate the relationships , " he said .
" I do n't bring these deals in . "
He said Giorango had led him to believe the money for the casino mortgage was going toward a condo development , and he emphasized that because banks do n't generally run background checks of their borrowers , he had no way of knowing that Giorango had a criminal record .
His general election opponent , Republican Christine Radogno , seized on the controversy , accusing Giannoulias of " an association with organized crime " and questioning what he 'd actually done at Broadway .
" When it was convenient he was the vice president in charge of loans , but when they became an issue he was n't involved , " she says .
The dailies followed up with stories about the Stratievsky loans .
Obama said Giannoulias needed to do a better job of explaining the loans to voters .
And some Democrats started mumbling that he should drop out of the race .
He did n't , but that fall he remained on the defensive .
" In a perfect world , we 'd only lend money to the most morally upstanding citizens , " he said on Chicago Tonight in October .
But " when you have over 10,000 customers , a $ 950 million bank , there are a handful of customers — not unlike other businesses — who have legal issues , legal issues which are completely unrelated to the conduct of the bank . "
Left mostly unexamined during the campaign was whether Broadway Bank 's loans to Giorango , the Stratievskys , Rezko , and other troubled developers were anything unusual for a bank of its size and mission .
Is it unheard of for banks to give out loans to ex-cons or businessmen involved in illegal dealings ?
It certainly was n't unheard of for these particular people — each one took out multiple loans from other banks before and after their deals with Broadway .
But Iannaccone , the consultant , who has 25 years experience as an investment banker and industry analyst , says banks typically know who they 're dealing with if they do a proper credit evaluation .
" Yes , you could go through every single bank portfolio and find loan files like that .
You could go to every bank , even the ones with the top [ performance and management ] rating , and find loans with information missing .
" But that is the easy statement to make .
Remember : when you take out a loan for a house or a car , they call your employer .
They check your payroll records .
When you take out a business loan , you are supposed to verify that this person has the financial wherewithal to pay them back .
A good bank will go out and the loan officer will visit the borrower at the site , ask who their top customers are , talk to the top customers , see what the bill cycle is like .
That 's what you 're supposed to do when you lend .
If you do n't , and you just take someone 's word , that 's poor underwriting . "
Supporters say that as he struggled to shake the loan flap Giannoulias became a stronger candidate — more confident before the press , more relaxed before the voters , more knowledgeable about the issues .
" The turning point was when I saw him do a debate during the campaign , " says Houlihan .
" It was clear he had some new perspective and energy to bring to the system . "
When he was n't fielding bank - related questions Giannoulias went after Radogno , calling her a " right - wing extremist , " and reminded voters that he had an ethics plan for the treasurer 's office : if elected he 'd accept no campaign contributions from banks because he'd be doing business with some of them as he managed the state 's accounts .
That July Giannoulias 's father died of a heart attack during a visit to Greece .
It was a personal blow to Giannoulias , who still calls his father one of his heroes , but he took his mother on the trail with him and his campaign was n't set back for long .
It turned out that 2006 was another Democratic year , especially in Illinois , where the tattered GOP lost every race for a statewide constitutional office .
Giannoulias was part of the wave , defeating Radogno 54 percent to 42 percent .
On January 9 , 2007 , his first day at his new job , Giannoulias delivered on his campaign pledge to ban contributions to the treasurer from any firm doing business with the office .
He also prohibited office employees from donating to the treasurer 's political fund .
" Trading political money for political favors is a way of doing business that seems ingrained in our system of government , " he declared , taking a not - so - subtle swipe at Governor Blagojevich , whose administration was under federal investigation .
" It 's poisoned the political climate and resulted in the public 's distrust of our elected officials .
That 's wrong . "
It was the new treasurer 's first move showing his knack for good government and good press .
In March he announced that he and Topinka , his predecessor , had worked together to bring in a new manager for Bright Start , the state 's college savings program .
He said the manager , OppenheimerFunds , would charge lower fees and improve returns .
Later that month he came out against Blagojevich 's unpopular — and unviable — proposal to raise the state 's gross receipts tax , arguing that it would kill business .
In June he showed up at the opening of a north - side community center for gays and lesbians , and a few weeks later he held a press conference in Grant Park to introduce a new program called Green Rewards , which offered tax rebates to drivers who traded in their cars for hybrids and other fuel - efficient models — sort of a predecessor to the Cash for Clunkers program .
" Hybrid cars use less gas , but they cost more upfront , " Giannoulias said .
" This will help [ drivers ] recoup their investment faster while they save money at the pump . "
That plan got kudos from Mayor Daley and environmentalists , but the Tribune 's editorial board rolled its eyes .
" It would be unfair to accuse Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias of contracting an early - onset case of the disease that ails Blagojevich : government by public relations .
Unfair , but tempting .
. . .
His unveiling this week of a program that makes Illinois taxpayers subsidize the purchase of hybrid vehicles that already are popular strikes us as a classic case of nanny - statism , political opportunism , or both . "
Giannoulias 's office gave out $ 2 million in rebates before running out of money and ending the Green Rewards program in May 2008 .
Over the next year , by keeping up an ambitious public schedule , making sober pronouncements about issues great , small , and previously unheard of , Giannoulias established a higher profile than any treasurer in recent memory .
Among other things , he spoke out against bank consolidation that would cause job losses ; pressed banks that do business in Illinois to stop charging fees on money transfers for Holocaust reparations ; helped start a scholarship program for the children of military personnel killed in the line of duty ; moved to sell off a money - losing hotel the state had owned for years ; promoted a financial literacy program with Bears quarterback Kyle Orton ; and threatened to yank state money out of Wells Fargo accounts if the bank moved to liquidate Hartmarx , the bankrupt but esteemed Chicago - based suitmaker .
Even when the pension reform plan he floated in December 2008 did n't go anywhere because of a deadlocked legislature and trouble in the governor 's office , Giannoulias was praised for trying to confront one of the most serious and challenging issues facing the state .
" He 's got a great track record as treasurer , " says First Ward alderman Manny Flores .
" He 's dealt with issues that others in the past have n't had the stomach to take on . "
He 's also encountered some bumps .
This past January , Giannoulias announced that one of the funds in the Bright Start program had lost nearly 40 percent of its value .
He accused the fund 's manager , OppenheimerFunds , of making risky investments .
It later became clear that Oppenheimer had lost money for similar programs in other states , and Giannoulias joined some of their top officials in pressing the company to replenish the accounts .
Critics say Giannoulias could have kept better tabs on the program .
" When you 're investing money for parents trying to pay for their children 's college education , it should be very conservative , " says his former opponent Radogno , who 's now her party 's leader in the state senate .
" But the investments were far more risky than they should have been .
There 's a corollary here with what happened at his bank . "
Over the past summer Giannoulias made a political fumble when the Tribune revealed that his office had used some Bright Start funds to pay for a hybrid SUV that he and other employees drove around the state .
Initially Giannoulias dispatched a spokesman to say the car was needed to help promote the program .
When that did n't end the flap , he came forward to say the same thing himself , adding that the SUV was a good long - term investment .
Giannoulias has an uneven record on one of the ethics reforms he promised .
For two years he kept his campaign pledge not to take any political donations from banks .
But he 's skirted his own rules by accepting more than $ 90,000 from employees of banks and banking political action committees .
" As a person he seems very nice and likable , " says Radogno .
" But some of my concerns are still an issue as he tries to move up the political ladder — and they 're about his experience and judgment .
I do n't think I 've been made more comfortable by what I 've seen him do with the treasurer 's office . "
Others say he 's done a good job overall .
" They run a very efficient office , " says state rep Mark Beaubien , a Republican from Wauconda who sits on a committee Giannoulias formed to oversee the treasurer 's work .
" When he came in he kept the professional people who were in there before .
He 's extremely intelligent .
I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Giannoulias .
I just hope we can find someone to beat him . "
Since the moment he was elected , Giannoulias has been described as " ambitious . "
His every move has been scrutinized by political observers certain his eyes were on a prize beyond the treasurer 's office .
And Giannoulias has n't done much to discourage their speculation .
In August 2008 Giannoulias — along with state attorney general Lisa Madigan , comptroller Dan Hynes , Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. , and other top Illinois politicos — landed a speaking slot at the opening night of the Democratic National Convention , where Obama would be nominated for president .
" Barack Obama has been my basketball buddy , my friend , my mentor , and my inspiration , " Giannoulias said .
" For me , public service would not have been possible without the example he set as a friend , as a man , as a leader this nation needs . "
Away from the cameras , he threw a convention party — generally an indication that the host has begun networking with potential supporters and donors in advance of a campaign for higher office .
Back in Chicago , Giannoulias hosted another big fund - raiser for Obama , and as the likelihood of an Obama presidency grew , Giannoulias 's name was often floated as a possible replacement in the Senate .
On the morning of November 4 , Election Day , Giannoulias , Obama , and several other friends played basketball to try to work off some of the tension .
That night Obama was elected president — and the jockeying for his Senate seat soon reached a frenzy .
On December 9 , Governor Blagojevich was arrested and accused of trying to sell it to the highest bidder ; Giannoulias was among the first wave of politicians calling on him to resign .
Yet when reporters asked if he might run for the Senate himself in 2010 , Giannoulias said he'd been too busy to think about it .
" I 've been focused on trying to do my job and trying to rebuild the public 's trust in us as elected officials , " he said .
He apparently found the time over the next couple weeks .
By early February he was telling reporters that he was giving the Senate race serious consideration .
When the man Blagojevich did tap , former state attorney general Roland Burris , stumbled in several attempts to explain what he 'd discussed with Blagojevich aides before being appointed , Giannoulias joined the stampede urging him to quit .
On March 2 , Giannoulias announced that he was forming an exploratory committee .
He raised more than a million dollars in the next month .
Giannoulias 's announcement inspired little excitement in the White House .
Not only was there no Obama endorsement , but word started to leak out of Washington that Obama advisers and top Senate Democrats were working to recruit someone else .
Lisa Madigan met with Obama aides in the White House in June , according to her spokeswoman , and sources close to Cook County sheriff Tom Dart said he was contacted as well .
In both cases , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee promised that they would n't have to worry about raising money .
Given the credentials and popularity of Madigan — Mark Kirk said he would n't run if he had to oppose her — and Dart , who 's highly popular in Cook County and has lots of political allies downstate , the race looked like close to a sure thing for either of them .
Yet both declined to run , saying they 'd rather try to keep their current jobs .
A couple other elite names also flirted with running — Bill Daley , the mayor 's brother and Clinton 's commerce secretary , and Christopher Kennedy , the son of Robert Kennedy and head of the Merchandise Mart — before opting out .
Giannoulias is left with three rivals with far less name recognition or money than he has — Jackson , Hoffman , and Meister .
Supporters of Giannoulias say he did n't blink at the possibility of facing big - name opponents .
" He stood steadfast and weathered the political storms , " says county assessor Houlihan .
" I 'm not sure what really happened there , but I think opponents of Alexi are trying to make it seem that the White House wanted other candidates , " says Jerry Morrison , the state director of the Service Employees International Union , which has endorsed Giannoulias .
" Look , I know people in the White House and I talk to them regularly , and I have n't heard anything to suggest they 're unhappy with Alexi . "
A couple weeks ago , Giannoulias told me that he'd met with Obama 's advisers in the White House too .
" They never promised they would back me or anything , " he said .
" I did n't expect anything .
I think they just wanted Lisa because they knew she could win it — and why fight for it if you do n't have to ? "
Obama adviser David Axelrod said essentially the same thing a few days later in an interview with Chicago News Cooperative columnist and Reader publisher James Warren .
" I thought Lisa would give us the best shot , " Axelrod said .
Naturally , Giannoulias 's opponents say he 's simply a weak candidate .
" In his seven years of experience at the bank and in the treasurer 's office , he 's acquired more baggage than most people do over their whole careers , " says Michael Powell , who 's Hoffman 's campaign manager .
The baggage , according to political insiders , including many who say they like Giannoulias , is the family business .
This time the loans are n't the only issue — there 's now the matter of the health of Broadway Bank .
At the end of 2006 , the last year Giannoulias worked there , Broadway Bank reported net income of more than $ 45 million , and its return on assets was ranked fifth nationally among 240 banks of its size .
But it ranked tenth in the share of its loans tied up in construction and development projects ( 44 percent ) and second in the share of its loans that went toward real estate ( 97 percent ) , according to Russ Yates of SNL Financial , a firm that specializes in bank and real estate data analysis .
Then the real estate market began to sink , and fast , leaving many of Broadway 's borrowers struggling to keep up with their loan payments .
FDIC records show that from the end of 2006 to the end of 2007 the value of the bank 's bad real estate loans — those at least 90 days past due — more than doubled , from $ 3.4 million to $ 7.4 million .
And that was just the beginning of the trouble .
By December 2008 the figure had soared to $ 39.3 million .
Giannoulias had left the bank for the treasurer 's office by this time , but since there 's typically some lag time between when a loan is taken out and when it goes bad , it 's probable that some of Broadway 's problem loans were issued on his watch .
Meanwhile , Broadway continued its risky real estate lending practices .
The bank went from $ 356 million in construction and development loans in 2006 to $ 443 million in September 2009 ;
Yates says it now has a larger portion of its loan portfolio tied up in C & D projects than all but two of those 240 similarly sized banks .
And the number of these loans going south has also increased .
Less than 2 percent of the bank 's loans were at least 90 days past due in 2006 ; now nearly a quarter of them are , which is the second - worst rate in the nation for a bank of its size .
Broadway 's gone from being among the country 's most profitable institutions to operating in the red .
Last year it reported a $ 14 million loss , and it lost another $ 27 million in the first nine months of this year .
Analysts say that when banks engage in high - risk lending they 're supposed to sock away extra money to protect them against the likely losses .
From 2002 through 2006 , Broadway paid out between $ 11.3 and $ 15.4 million a year in cash dividends , according to FDIC reports .
In 2007 and 2008 , as its earnings went south , it paid out $ 47.8 million and $ 34.5 million .
The Giannoulias family owns all the stock in the bank 's holding company .
By this fall Broadway was at its lowest level of equity — the capital invested in the institution — in six years .
" Once their loans started going bad , what did they do ? " says Iannaccone .
" They pulled money out , and that is the problem . "
My calls to Broadway Bank 's president , Alexi 's brother Demetris , were n't returned .
But Alexi says most of the bank 's payouts in 2007 and 2008 were dictated by his father 's will , which specified that estate taxes be covered with dividends .
With a 3.6 percent stake in Broadway , Giannoulias says , he received about $ 2.5 million under this arrangement and paid about half of it in taxes .
At the end of September , 552 banks were on the FDIC 's " problem list , " up more than tenfold from 2006 .
There 's no way to know if Broadway is one of them — the feds keep the names secret to prevent runs .
If the bank were to fail , the federal government would be on the hook to cover much of Broadway 's $ 1.1 billion in deposits out of money that banks — through fees paid by their customers — contribute to an insurance fund .
And what would happen , some Democrats wonder , if that happened after Giannoulias won the Democratic nomination but before the general election ?
" I think we 're going to lose the seat , " says Delmarie Cobb , a political consultant whose clients include Burris ( who 's not running to keep the seat ) .
" He needed to spend [ more ] time in [ state ] office to let the controversies die down and build a record apart from them . "
Nonsense , say Giannoulias 's supporters .
" Broadway Bank was a community bank and has not been viewed as part of the problem , " says Jerry Morrison .
" Lots of small businesses are in trouble .
This is n't a Wells Fargo or Bank of America . "
Morrison says voters will be more impressed with Giannoulias 's progressive positions on issues that directly affect them .
" I actually think it 's a strong profile , to have somebody who comes out of a community banking background but stands up for working people . "
Last Tuesday Giannoulias held a press conference to propose new regulations on banks and nonbank mortgage lenders .
Among his ideas was a plan to require banks to keep more capital on hand to better insulate them from failure .
" But only when the economy has stabilized , " he said .
The reporters present did n't ask why Broadway Bank had n't kept more capital on hand .
They had other questions , like , did the White House try to recruit Lisa Madigan to run against him because they 're worried about Broadway Bank 's ties to the notorious Tony Rezko ?
" I think you 'd have to ask the White House , " he said coolly .
What about Broadway Bank 's risky loans for development projects in Florida ?
" You have hundreds of community banks across the country dealing with some of the biggest challenges in their history , including Broadway Bank , " he said .
" I do n't think even someone as smart as you could have seen the real estate market going the way it has .
But you know , I have n't worked there for a while now . "
Despite his ownership share , he said , he has no voting rights or management input .
He later added that he'd be willing to put money back into the bank to help save it if necessary .
The next day , the day before Thanksgiving , the Giannoulias campaign released his last four years of tax returns .
In addition to the dividends he says were dictated by his father 's will , he made nearly $ 5.5 million from 2005 through 2008 , almost all of it as a stakeholder in Broadway Bank .

For weeks we 've reported that the wireless industry has been pressing the Federal Communications Commission to figure out ways to get the mobile services more spectrum licenses .
Experts are darkly warning of a looming spectrum crisis , as consumers rush to buy bandwidth - gobbling smart phones .
CTIA , the Wireless Association , says its member companies urgently need 800MHz of license space below the 3GHz mark .
That , of course , means looking at broadcast television territory , aka the VHF and UHF bands in the 52 through 698 MHz zone .
But the question is , how should the industry tap into this TV spectrum in , shall we say , a sharing and collegial manner .
CTIA and the Computer Electronics Association ( CEA ) now say they 've got a plan to do just that .
We can't predict how the television broadcasters will react to it , but here 's the proposal .
Smaller footprints
There are about 1,800 high - power licensed television stations in the United States ; the gist of the scheme is to move broadcast TV from a system based on single , high power transmitters towards " distributed networks " — closely spaced arrays of lower - power towers .
The latter deployment would create " a much smaller interference footprint " around TV transmitters , CTIA / CEA say , " and therefore should permit closer spacing between co-channel and adjacent channel television operations . "
This would free up between 100 to 180 MHz of spectrum for wireless , the two trade groups estimate , perhaps worth as much as $ 70 billion , when put to its new and improved uses .
" This substantial amount of spectrum is clearly worth pursuing , even if it does require significant adjustments to the broadcast network , " their filing to the FCC insists .
The problem , as CTIA / CEA sees it , is that high - powered , high - altitude television transmitters cover big geographic areas , but they also occupy large amounts of spectrum in any region .
A high - powered transmission via channel 25 by one broadcaster sometimes makes that channel unusable by any other licensee for up to 150 miles .
The system also circumscribes adjacent channel use , CTIA / CEA complain .
And although these powerful broadcasts are licensed to use 6MHz of spectrum ( eg , KQED - TV in San Francisco , California : 566 - 572 MHz ) , they sometimes occupy far more — up to 18MHz , three times that much .
Single - frequency networks
This high - power / high - altitude transmitter system was devised back in the early TV days when wireless service was n't so omnipresent .
Now critics charge that the TV bands are seriously under-utilized .
So what 's the solution ?
Replace the status quo with " single - frequency network " ( SFN ) architecture , CTIA / CEA recommends .
Scotch those big transmitters and use bunches of shorter and lower - powered ones in their stead .
It 's not like SFN is something these guys just pulled out of their hat .
The FCC has authorized the practice in the recent past .
As zero hour for the DTV transition approached , the agency gave the green light for TV stations to use SFN Distributed Transmission Systems ( DTS ) to get at hilly areas that agency engineers feared would be left in the dark by the switchover .
Plus : " Multiple DTS transmitters generally operate at a lower power than a single transmitter to achieve the same coverage and thereby reduce the likelihood of causing interference to neighboring licensees , " the Commission noted in its Order .
But CTIA / CEA acknowledge that SFN has risks , most notably a potential " ghosting " effect — transmission echoes that can interfere with TV reception if the arrays of simultaneous signals are n't carefully synchronized .
Some work on DTS synchronization standards already exists , but more will likely be needed , their filing concedes , " to confirm that a wide scale deployment of DTS for broadcast television is achievable and would allow for the significant gains in spectrum efficiency expected . "
Once that is done , however , increased reliance on DTS would be good for broadcasters , CTIA / CEA insist , " opening up new segments of the market and giving broadcasters access to consumers who may have previously relied upon other video distribution systems for their television programming , " especially those in mountainous areas .
And these clumps of low - power transmitters could offer better reception quality , being closer to the ground , therefore nearer to homes .
Repacking risks
The ultimate point of this plan , of course , is to free of lots of spectrum for the wireless industry by squishing the nation 's full - power TV stations into a more compact area of the spectrum band .
This " could represent a major step towards satisfying the pressing need for substantial amounts of additional mobile broadband spectrum that is imminent for our country , " CTIA / CEA concludes .
No word as to what the National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) and its engineering arm , the Association of Maximum Service Television ( MSTV ) , think of this proposal , which was submitted to the FCC just before the holidays .
But strong hints of their stance can be found in another FCC proceeding .
In early December the agency issued a Notice of Inquiry on how efficiently the TV bands are being used .
The Notice pointedly asked for an assessment of the " impact to the U.S. economy and public welfare if the coverage of free over - the - air broadcast television was diminished to accommodate a repacking of stations to recover spectrum . "
That would be very bad indeed , NAB and MSTV quickly responded .
" Repacking DTV broadcast stations could cause serious disruptions to the public ’s broadcast television service , and many viewers could lose substantial or all local television service , " they warned .
" These disruptions would be orders of magnitude worse than those that the public experienced during the transition to digital television , when a limited number of broadcasters instituted necessary facility changes . "
Still , give CTIA / CEA credit for moving the discussion past dire warnings of spectrum droughts .
Now we 've got a plan to consider , which can be answered with criticisms and concerns , followed by discussion , and ultimately compromise .
At least that 's the Holiday Season version of the outcome .
“ Regarding the new policy of President Obama , we are studying that policy , ” Mr. Gilani said .
“ We need more clarity on it , and when we get more clarity on it we can see what we can implement on that plan . ”
He was also asked about Western demands that Pakistan hunt more rigorously for Mr. bin Laden , widely believed in Washington and London to have fled the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban regime there in late 2001 .
“ I doubt the information which you are giving is correct because I do n’t think Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan , ” Mr. Gilani said , echoing similar comments by other Pakistani leaders in recent years who have sometimes hinted that they believe Mr. bin Laden died of renal failure some time after trekking over the 14,000 - foot shoulder of the Tora Bora mountains .
The Pakistani leader did not indicate where Mr. bin Laden might be if he is not in Pakistan .
Western intelligence officials concluded long ago that the senior Qaeda leaders had taken sanctuary most likely in North or South Waziristan , some 200 miles from Islamabad , Pakistan ’s capital .
Mr. Brown announced on Thursday that Britain would contribute around $ 83 million to help Pakistan pursue militants in the lawless regions along the Afghan border .
His tone seemed milder than it had been over the weekend when , in two hard - edged statements , he signaled a renewed sense of impatience in the approach that Britain and the United States planned to take toward the governments in Kabul and Islamabad as the allies step up their commitment to the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda .

It ’s not marijuana , but some local law enforcement officials say it ’s very similar .
It ’s a legal , smokable herbal mixture called K2 , and is available in Lawrence .
“ This is basically a synthetic marijuana , ” said Deputy Tom Erickson of the Johnson County Sheriff ’s Office .
“ It ’s still the same type of thing . ”
Erickson said the Johnson County crime lab tested K2 – which looks like potpourri and retails for about $ 10 per gram – and found that it had chemical properties that are similar to THC , the active ingredient in marijuana .
K2 can be purchased at a downtown shop , Sacred Journey , 1103 Mass .
Employees at the store declined an interview request .
The substance ’s similarity to marijuana is catching the eye of school officials and substance abuse treatment providers .
The Olathe school district has dealt with a couple of cases of students possessing K2 in the schools , said Carol LeVar , executive director for general administration for the district .
“ We ’re on the lookout , ” she said .
The Olathe student code provides for disciplinary action on substances such as K2 , even though it ’s legal .
LeVar said that the district has concerns about K2 , similar to those they have with illegal substances such as marijuana .
“ We ’d deal with it pretty seriously , ” LeVar said .
Officials from Lawrence schools said they are n’t aware of K2 showing up in schools , but that does n’t mean local youth are n’t using the substance , said Kendall Heiman , director of Professional Treatment Services , a Lawrence - based substance abuse treatment center .
“ It seems to have quite a presence in Douglas and Johnson counties , ” she said .
Heiman said counselors at her agency have seen a “ dramatic increase ” in youths using the substance in the last month .
The substance does n’t show up on a drug test , which makes it an attractive alternative to marijuana , she said .
Because K2 is legal in the United States , Lawrence police Sgt. Bill Cory said , that leaves it out of the bounds of law enforcement .
“ We know it is out there but have not seen it .
Since it is a legal substance there is not much we can do about it , ” Cory said .
But that does n’t mean K2 is safe , said Heiman , who cites a variety of issues raised by the substance .
For one , it ’s relatively unstudied .
“ There ’s no one who really knows a whole lot about it , ” she said .
Heiman also has concerns that the high cost of the substance – which comes in a variety of flavors and potencies – will lead to more crime for those wanting to purchase it .
And she sees the same potential issues with K2 as she sees with marijuana : negative health effects , impaired driving , poor decision - making and drug dependency .
Erickson said that the potential problems with K2 have Johnson County officials planning a proposal for a change at the state legislative level that would make K2 illegal .
“ We ’re just putting together a proposal , ” said Erickson .
But that will take time , and Erickson said it ’s important for parents to be aware of K2 .
“ If your kids have this and are using it , they ’re getting high , ” he said .
Get the most from your shut - eye ( Image : Susanne Walstrom / Getty )
Sounds played as you sleep can reinforce memories , suggest Ken Paller and his colleagues at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois .
They asked people to memorise which images and their associated sounds – such as a picture of a cat and a miaow – were associated with a certain area on a computer screen and then to take a nap .
They played half the group the sounds in their sleep , and these people were better at remembering the associations than the rest when they woke up .
Paller hopes sounds can be used to improve all kinds of memory and next he ’ll be figuring out if we can learn languages while we snooze .
But before you nod off , New Scientist helps you get the most out of your shut - eye .

How can you boost your sleep learning capacity ?
As a rule , hit the hay after learning something new – late - night TV and Xbox marathons are a no- no .
That is , of course , unless the skill you hope to learn is a computer game : when Sidarta Ribeiro of the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neuroscience in Natal , Brazil , got people to play shoot - ’em - up video game Doom before bed , those who dreamed about the game during their sleep were better players the next day .
Once asleep , playing sound cues ( see above ) may work for some , but if you like to slumber in silence , try smells instead .
A couple of years ago , Björn Rasch and his colleagues at the University of Lübeck in Germany found that people were better at remembering where objects belonged on a computer screen when they were reminded with the scent of a rose , which they had smelled during the learning task , and again during their sleep .
What ’s better – one long sleep or lots of short naps ?
Take a leaf out of granny ’s book – afternoon naps are good for you .
Jim Horne , who researches sleep at Loughborough University , UK , thinks that even a 10 - minute kip can improve performance , and that this could be lifesaving in the case of overtired drivers and nurses .
Such short shut - eye means that you wo n’t fall into a deep sleep , so you can easily recover without experiencing “ sleep inertia ” ( see below ) .
In fact , others claim that it is the process of drifting off , rather than the deep sleep itself , that is good for you .
Olaf Lahl ‘s students at the University of Düsseldorf , Germany , performed better in memory tests only 5 minutes after falling asleep .
However , do n’t give up on long sleep : rapid - eye movement ( REM ) sleep , which occurs later in sleep , is thought to be important for memory processing .
What ’s this about people who do n’t sleep enough getting fat ?
Our hectic modern lifestyles and shorter visits to the land of nod have been linked by some to expanding waistlines .
Sanjay Patel ( PDF ) and his colleagues at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , put the theory to the test in 2006 and found that short - sleeping women were 15 per cent more likely to become obese than their well - rested counterparts .
Jim Horne , on the other hand , reckons such effects might be overblown .
In Patel ’s study , the average difference in weight gain between the two groups was a measly 700 grams over 10 years .
Besides ,
Horne says , we ’re probably getting about the same amount of sleep as we ever did – around seven and a quarter hours .
Why does lack of sleep make you grumpy and groggy ?
Even the best of us has woken up confused and disorientated , usually when we ’re awoken during a deep sleep , known as “ slow - wave sleep ” .
David Dinges of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia found that people who were woken up during this deep sleep could n’t do simple arithmetic , a phenomenon called “ sleep inertia ” .
But the grumpiness associated with a lack of sleep could be due to a different point in the sleep cycle , REM sleep .
This is when we do most of our dreaming , and some think dreams are important for processing the emotions we experience during the day .
Matt Walker , a psychologist at the University of Berkeley , California , has even described this process as “ overnight therapy ” .
How does sleeping improve your memory ?
Deszo Nemeth , a psychologist at the University of Szeged in Hungary , suggests that while we sleep , short - term “ working memories ” are transferred from the hippocampus of the brain to the cortex , where they become more stable , long - term memories .
Meanwhile , Catherine Siengsukon of the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City reviewed the evidence for “ offline practice ” – practising skills during sleep – earlier this year .
She reckons that motor learning – training brain areas that control muscles – during sleep could help rehabilitate young , brain - damaged patients .
When does sleep learning take place ?
Different stages in the sleep cycle are important for different types of memory .
REM sleep seems to be important for perceptual memory , “ like when you ’re learning to play darts ” , says Paller , while the consolidation of “ declarative ” memories – facts and events – happens during deep slow - wave sleep .
Is there any way of controlling which stage of sleep you ’re in ?
Jan Born and his team at the University of Lübeck managed to prolong slow - wave sleep in a group of people by applying an electric current to their scalps while they slept .
Sure enough , these people performed better on a word - association task the following day .
REM sleep , however , is still something of a mystery : some anti-depressants reduce it , but we do n’t know how to stimulate it , says Paller .
“ We do know that REM sleep tends to happen early in the morning , so perhaps a lie in would help , ” he suggests .

As millions of Americans struggle to hold on to their homes , Wall Street has found a way to make money from the mortgage mess .
Investment funds are buying billions of dollars ’ worth of home loans , discounted from the loans ’ original value .
Then , in what might seem an act of charity , the funds are helping homeowners by reducing the size of the loans .
But as part of these deals , the mortgages are being refinanced through lenders that work with government agencies like the Federal Housing Administration .
This enables the funds to pocket sizable profits by reselling new , government - insured loans to other federal agencies , which then bundle the mortgages into securities for sale to investors .
While homeowners save money , the arrangement shifts nearly all the risk for the loans to the federal government  and , ultimately , taxpayers  at a time when Americans are falling behind on their mortgage payments in record numbers .

Plumber with shattered arm left horrifically bent out of shape has operation ' cancelled four times '
A plumber whose arm was left twisted grotesquely out of shape in an accident ten months ago has had an operation to correct it ' cancelled four times ' .
Torron Eeles , 50 , has been left unable to work since falling down the stairs and now fears he may lose his home after being denied incapacity benefit .
The father - of - three today hit out at the NHS for the ' unacceptable delays ' , but East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust said Mr Eeles had his operation cancelled on ' only ' two occasions on clinical safety grounds .
His left arm has hung limply by his side since he fractured the humerus bone in December 2008 .
Mr Eeles , from Welham Green , Hertfordshire , applied for employment and support allowance but a doctor ruled he is ineligible for both because he can turn on a tap .
' Unacceptable ' : Torron Eeles has been left unable to work since falling down the stairs and now fears he may lose his home after being denied incapacity benefit
He said : ' This whole situation is absolutely disgusting .
I have never heard of anyone else having a broken arm for ten months .
' It 's been so long the bones have knitted back together .
Sleeping is really uncomfortable because whenever I roll over my arm gets in the way .
' I'm a kitchen fitter and plumber by trade but I can't even slice a loaf of bread let alone work .
' This has been going on and on and it 's a complete nightmare . '
Mr Eeles fractured his arm on December 3 and was rushed straight to casualty where doctors put his arm in plaster .
But within a few weeks a specialist said the bones were too far apart and that surgeons would have to insert a metal plate because there was too much movement in the arm .
Mr Eeles claims his first two operations at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Welwyn Garden City , Hertfordshire , were cancelled due to a lack of beds and operating time respectively .
His third operation in February was postponed after he was found to have high blood pressure , while the fourth , scheduled for May , was abandoned because of concerns about his smoking .
The plaster was removed from Mr Eeles ' arm after three months and he was given a wrist sling , which he branded ' totally useless ' .
' Complete nightmare ' : Mr Eeles claims the NHS has cancelled an operation to correct his grotesquely broken arm ' four times '
He said : ' My arm just flops about but the sling was n't doing anything .
The plaster did n't make a blind bit of difference after a couple of weeks either .
' How the Jobcentre can say I 'm fit I do n't know .
I was on incapacity benefit until a few weeks ago when I went to be assessed by a doctor in Luton .
' He said because I can turn on a tap and I can lift my arm I do n't qualify for help .
' Now I 'm worried about losing my house .
I 've got a mortgage on it and there are credit cards debts I 'm struggling to pay because I can't work . '
Nick Carver , the chief executive of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust , insisted computer records showed the trust had only cancelled two operations and that proceeding with the operations could have put Mr Eeles 's life at risk .
Mr Carver said : ' Mr Eeles ' operation was cancelled only twice - and then both on clinical safety grounds .
' The first time was back in February when his blood pressure was found to be high .
' As his surgery was not an emergency , our surgeons took the right action in referring Mr Eeles to his GP so his blood pressure could be brought under control .
' His second operation in May 2009 was also cancelled , this time because he had failed to act on our surgeon 's advice that Mr Eeles that he should give up smoking .
' In cancelling Mr Eeles ' two operation dates , our surgeons were acting on clinical grounds only .
' If they are guilty of anything , then it is of having the best clinical interests of their patients at heart . '
The FCC , which strongly supports rural broadband expansion wo n’t specify how much of a tax should be imposed , only that a tax should be the primary vehicle to finance rural broadband .
Congress would set a tax rate at a later date after a year or more of hearings and comment at the FCC and in Congress .
A broadband tax proposal will spark a fierce battle .
Businesses and consumer groups will fight the prospect of higher phone taxes , and deficit hawks will oppose efforts to add tens of billions to the deficit to finance rural broadband connectivity .
In the end , though , some combination of the two is likely in advance of actual deployment of rural broadband , a project that will take a decade .
The first step will be taken by the Federal Communications Commission , which is likely to formally propose broadband taxes in February , arguing that the current Universal Service
Fee paid by telephone companies and consumers to provide phone service to rural areas should be expanded and funded at a higher rate to cover construction , development and maintenance of rural broadband services .
Rural high - speed Internet service is years away and ultimately will require a combination of new phone taxes and billions of dollars more in federal support .
Neither will happen easily or quickly , but it ’s the most likely policy route Washington will take as broadband stretches into rural and underserved areas in the next decade .
The goal of ubiquitous high - speed broadband has bipartisan appeal in Washington and remains an important domestic initiative of the Obama administration .
Both parties strongly support closing the digital divide and view it as an economic , educational and social policy plus .
The extension of broadband into rural areas , such as to parts of the northern Plains , western mountain states and large swaths of southern Gulf states would help encourage business development and online commerce .
But like many large and ambitious national projects , financing is the challenge .
Cost estimates for universal broadband connecting nearly all parts of the country vary widely .
Leading telecom industry experts put it in the $ 200 billion to $ 300 billion range to cover the cost of all the cable , connections , equipment and servicing .
The large telecom companies wo n’t foot the bill on their own , and a variety of tax incentives to spur them or other investors to take on the challenge are not enough .
At the same time , a huge federal injection of money to finance nationwide broadband is simply untenable politically and fiscally at present .
Advertisement - Article continues below
For comparison , the economic stimulus bill earlier this year included $ 7.2 billion to jump - start rural broadband efforts , but telecom giants like Verizon , Comcast and AT&T would n’t touch the funds , not only because they were not enough but also because they would come with a host of regulations .
There is bipartisan draft legislation by Reps.
Rick Boucher , D- VA , and Lee Terry , R-NE , to expand the scope of the Universal Service Fund to cover rural broadband development , but the legislation will serve largely as a talking point for now while the industry awaits the FCC proposal early next year .
Odds are that some type of broadband tax will be enacted in two or three years along with a commitment by the president and Congress of more federal support down the road .
But there ’ll be no injection of $ 100 billion or more in federal money to finance the bulk of the project .
Support for such a large federal injection of funding simply can’t be envisioned for now , not with the high deficit , the health care bill , a possible energy bill , rising entitlement costs and the overseas military commitments that are ongoing .
Skidelsky takes a more systematic approach , dividing Keynes ’s thinking into its political , economic and moral elements .
In this telling , Keynes ’s political views were dominated by a pragmatism similar to what Clarke describes , where the best is the enemy of the good .
Keynes was no socialist , but also no free - market ideologue .
He was interested in what worked .
In economics , the crucial Keynesian concept is uncertainty .
Where it prevails , the simple rules of classical economics do n’t apply .
That ’s because the classical economics that both predated Keynes and superseded him relies on rational actors making rational assessments .
In order to make such assessments you have to have reliable knowledge , usually derived from past experience .
Buyers of oranges or newspapers or legal services can be said to possess such knowledge .
Buyers of speculative securities cannot .
They ’re always looking into an uncertain future , “ anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be , ” as Keynes put it .
This , in Skidelsky ’s convincing telling , is why financial markets are so prone to disorder and disaster .
It ’s not that investors are terribly irra­tional .
It ’s that no one can really know what rational means when it comes to pricing investment securities .
That ’s why relying on financial markets to make big economic decisions can be so problematic , and why economic theories built on the assumption that financial markets behave ration­ally fail to explain our world .
Skidelsky is of the opinion that graduate education in economics should be sharply divided into micro­economics , in which students single - mindedly focus their mathematical and logical skills on problems that are n’t dominated by uncertainty , and macroeconomics , which requires a more varied humanistic training .
If economics does not contain all the answers , where are we to find them ?
This was a question to which Keynes gave a lot of thought .
As a young man he was highly influenced by the teachings of the Cambridge philosopher G. E. Moore , who preached that we should strive for a “ good ” that was neither moral nor hedonistic ( nor even definable ) .
Later on , Keynes was to acknowledge that this “ good ” might be a less elegant concept than he had once thought .
He and his Bloomsbury friends believed for a time that they had discovered a modern , secular set of ideals , but may simply have been embroidering on the Christian tradition of their parents .
As he wrote to his friend Virginia Woolf , “ We destroyed Xty & yet had its benefits . ”
In a famous 1930 essay , “ The Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren , ” the grandchildless ( and childless ) Keynes sketched a distant , “ Star Trek ” - like future where once “ the economic problem was solved , ” people could focus on the things that mattered most .
But what mattered most ?
Keynes had no real answer for that and could see that coming up with an answer would be a fraught and dangerous task for most societies .
But just by trying to address it , he made his economics a very different subject than the single - minded pursuit of resource - maximization that calls itself economics today .
Ms. Wintour declined to comment on Ms. Subkoff 's accusation that she favors gay men among designers prominently featured in Vogue .
But other designers came to her defense , noting the November and December issues show dresses by Vera Wang on the cover .
There is little dispute that the designs of John Galliano , Mr. Jacobs , Mr. Rodriguez , Olivier Theyskens and Karl Lagerfeld , all prominently featured on Vogue covers this year , merit the spotlight .
In some quarters , the perception exists that fashion 's main consumers , women , are more comfortable taking advice about how they should look from a man .
" Men are often better designers for women than other women , " said Tom Ford , the former creative director of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent , who more than anyone in the past decade built a brand on his own persona , that of a man whose sensual appeal is to both men and women .
Whereas Bill Blass , Valentino and Oscar de la Renta founded their empires on the strength of a nonthreatening , nonsexual charisma , Mr. Ford aggressively promoted his sexually charged designs .
" Of course there are many more gay male designers , " Mr. Ford said .
" I think we are more objective .
We do n't come with the baggage of hating certain parts of our bodies . "
Some designers embrace an extreme version of this position .
Michael Vollbracht , the current designer of Bill Blass , said he believes that gay men are demonstrably superior at design , their aesthetic formed by a perception of a woman as an idealized fantasy .
" I come from a time when gay men dressed women , " Mr. Vollbracht said .
" We did n't bed them .
Or at least I did n't .
I am someone who is really pro-homosexual .
I am an elitist .
I am better than straight people .
Women are confused about who they want to be .
I believe that male designers have the fantasy level that women do not . "
When women design for other women , Mr. Ford said , they proceed from a standpoint of practicality -- not fantasy .
" Sometimes women are trapped by their own views of themselves , but some have built careers around that , " he said .
" Donna Karan was obsessed with her hips and used her own idiosyncrasies to define her brand . "
Ms. Buchman sees little value in such arguments .
If men are more objective , she countered , then women are empathetic , which can be useful in understanding the consumer .
" I wear my own clothes , " she said .
" I have lived the life of my customer . "
" This disparity is tied in with a lot of areas , not just fashion , where women have achieved less in the eyes of the world , " Ms. Buchman said .
" It is puzzling and troubling to me as a 1970 's feminist but who knows , maybe this generation will be the one to change it all . "
The only condition he placed on the gifts was that he remain anonymous , so only a handful of people at the A.C.L.U. knew he was the donor .
He did not respond to e-mail messages or a letter sent to him in care of his investment vehicle , the Quercus Trust .
Calls to the phone numbers listed on filings the trust has made with the Securities and Exchange Commission resulted in busy signals .
Mr. Romero told the organization ’s national board about the loss of Mr. Gelbaum ’s money at its last board meeting in October , breaking the news in executive session .
Mr. Romero did not reveal Mr. Gelbaum ’s name , describing him only as “ a donor , ” board members said
Still , it is hard to keep secrets with a board of more than 80 members , most of whom report to state affiliates .
“ As soon as he started telling us , anyone who had a laptop with them was busy Googling ” and figured out who the donor was , a national board member said .
Mr. Romero told the board that the donor had also stopped giving to three “ sister organizations , ” a phrase board members said he had used in the past to describe other groups with which the A.C.L.U. has collaborated , like the Sierra Club .
Mr. Gelbaum took a rare turn in the spotlight earlier this decade when environmental activists said he was behind the Sierra Club ’s decision to adopt a neutral stance on immigration .
Some people believe immigration has aggravated environmental problems .
He had given the organization a total of $ 101.5 million , according to The Los Angeles Times , which wrote what is perhaps the only major profile of him , in 2004 .
In the article , he is quoted as saying that he told Carl Pope , the Sierra Club ’s executive director , in 1994 or 1995 “ that if they ever came out anti-immigration , they would never get a dollar from me . ”

Via Reddit ,
Reddit , I had to create an account to post about what just happened on my campus .
I go to the University of Pittsburgh .
Pittsburgh … G20 , you know .
President Obama ’s dinner for the delegates happened just off campus , within eyesight of us — usually .
When people grouped up by the street that would lead to the Phipps Conservatory , they were met with armored police .
For a while the students and locals just stood and talked while the police line faced us .
Some people sang and had signs .
Others just watched .
Slowly , the line of locals began to advance .
A police officer with a megaphone stepped out several times and told us to leave the area , but as we were n’t doing anything wrong , most people did n’t leave .
That ’s when they shot a canister of gas at us .
Reddit , sprinting away from armored police who looked like Storm Troopers from Star Wars , hearing that hissing sound while one of my favorite spots on campus filled with smoke … it was terrifying .
When the smoke cleared the crowd was still there .
This standoff lasted several hours .
Around 10:30 , the atmosphere had changed .
The police had advanced far up the road toward students , who were kept back to a grassy area called Schenley Plaza .
Students were singing and dancing .
It was very peaceful .
Someone said something to a cop .
Suddenly the guy was grabbed and thrown on the ground .
The crowd AT ONCE surrounded the cops and started chanting LET HIM GO !
LET HIM GO !
LET HIM GO !
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
There was a dumpster lit on fire further up the road , so I went up there to see what I could see , and suddenly there were tons of people sprinting down the sidewalk away from the fire .
SWAT vans and six or seven major police cars pulled up to Schenley Plaza .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Reddit , the next two hours were complete chaos .
My campus was invaded by armored police officers .
They threw actual tear gas into crowds of students .
They SHOT students with rubber bullets .
They beat slower - moving students with a baton .
I saw a group of cyclists being herded down the sidewalk .
A cop reached out and pushed a woman on a bike .
She turned around and pushed her bike at the cop .
Next thing we knew , he grabbed her by the face and slammed her down on the concrete .
They slowly advanced us back down Forbes Avenue , toward the major freshman dorms .
Several protesters broke storefront windows .
I ’d guess 20 protesting , about 1,000 students watching ( if that . )
The police fired Sound Cannons at us , a new weapon never before used on US citizens , which plays a sonic pulse that gives major headaches .
They fired more tear gas at the students .
Then riot squads came running up behind us and forced us into the Litchfield Towers Lobby .
People who did not make it into the lobby before the riot squads got to the doors were grabbed , thrown to the ground , beaten , and arrested .
Here is the part where I felt most violated —
The riot cops then ENTERED our dormitory and shouted that students needed to return to their rooms immediately .
Anyone arrested , they said , would be expelled from the University of Pittsburgh , no questions asked .
Reddit , is that legal ?
Would police be able to force someone on the sidewalk back in their home and make them barricade themselves in their basement ?
Here ’s another part that got me — I saw students try to get in the doors closest to their dorm building ( there are 3 towers ) , and the door was LOCKED .
These students did not have time to run around the building .
And they were grabbed .
We do n’t know what to do .
We ’re shocked .
BECAUSE THE DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF RELEASED A STATEMENT CLAIMING THEY WERE SECURING THE AREA FROM ANARCHISTS AND THAT “ SOME ” STUDENTS “ PROBABLY GOT CAUGHT UP ” IN WHAT HAPPENED .
So , in the news , you ’ll hear that police secured the campus from anarchists .
Not that students were attacked by security forces supposedly there to protect them .
PLEASE , help me get the word out .
I ’ll be around all day tomorrow for questions .

From WikiLeaks
September 16 , 2009
By Charles Arthur ( The Guardian ) [ 1 ]
Wikileaks is hosting what it says is a copy of the entire UK postcode list , last updated on July 8 2009 , that contains " all 1,841,177 UK post codes together with lattitude [ sic ] and longitude , grid references , county , district , ward , NHS codes and regions , Ordnance Survey reference , and date of introduction .
The database ... is over 100,000 pages in size . "
The 230MB file , zipped to 20 MB , does indeed contain a huge slew of postcodes in comma-separated form , with those details as headers for each column .
Oh my .
We have no idea who has leaked this , but it is the gateway to some valuable information : Royal Mail , as we ascertained previously in the Free Our Data campaign , sells the Postcode Address File ( aka PAF ) for a considerable sum , and makes a good profit on it : in August 2007 the postal regulator Postcomm revealed that PAF operations made a profit of £ 1.58 m on revenues of £ 18.36 m , all but £ 4 m from resellers .
This is n't quite that , however , because the PAF includes the names and / or addresses of houses in each postcode .
That would be 28 m locations - and that 's not what this file includes .
Instead , it 's got data that 's more useful to government , containing as it does NHS ward data .
Update : this seems to be the PostZon database which
allows you to link geographic and administrative data from government bodies , such as local authorities and the NHS , for all known Postcodes in the UK .
Use it to help plan routes , calculate distances between Postcodes , allocate sales force areas , distribute resources or locate facilities .
We have asked Royal Mail for a comment , but received none so far .
An early reaction from one web developer I know who uses postcodes to long / lat was not that impressed : " we can get this service free from Google via its mapping conversion system , " he pointed out .
" And that wo n't go slowly out of date . "
( Studies have shown that the PAF adds about 4,000 postcodes each month and drops 2,000 existing ones . )
A good point - and it is worth pointing out too that postcodes can cover large areas of a street or more , so long / lat is n't that useful really , though it might be for route planning .
A postcode will tend to be on a single route ( rather than two adjoining streets , say ) ; my own home postcode covers about half a mile , so the long / lat is by its nature not exact .
( I 've checked against this list , and it is the long / lat combination used by satnav systems , for example . )
Satnav companies would steer clear of this because they would know there 'll be some intentional errors in it which Royal Mail would sue them for using without a licence .
But there are surely web developers all over the country who are downloading it right now just to have a poke around and see if there is n't something useful they could do with it .
Free our data ?
It 's certainly gotten it out there .
Update : another web developer says " Google 's lookup is not accurate ( presumably due to licensing issues ) , and can only be used if you 're using a Google map ...
Postcode to long / lat is also incredibly useful - it's what powers WriteToThem , TheyWorkForYou , PlanningAlerts ... "
The upshot : this is a really useful database , for particular applications .
Why is n't it in the public domain , without copyright restrictions ?

What makes the comic books so special is the illustrations and the graphics .
Tintin would not be so special if Harge did not work hard on the graphics and illustrations that made it one of the worlds best comics .
Images always play a big role in making the narrative more interesting .
Ever since the prehistoric time ’s man has been painting out his thoughts and that is very much clear in the rock paintings when mankind had just begun to evolve .
Comic books came into the picture in the 1800s when they were published in the newspaper in an episodic manner .
Gasolene Alley and Katzenjammer Kids were among the first comic stories that were published .
These were later on published as the compilations and brought out as comic books .
This became a trend later and comics in different themes started being published such as Light humor comics like Peanuts , Superheroes comics like The Spectre , Adventure comics like Tarzan , Memoirs like My Friend Dahmer and many more .
It ’s the winter solstice , and Silicon Valley ’s atheists , agnostics and humanists want to extend their sincere , secular season ’s greetings .
While they reject the religious teachings behind Hanukkah and Christmas , the avowed nonbelievers are n’t against throwing parties , eating rich food or giving gifts .
“ Human beings need celebrations , ” said Arthur Jackson , founder of the Humanist Community in Silicon Valley .
“ It ’s good to step out of the norm and live more joyfully . ”
This past weekend there were solstice parties all over the Bay Area .
On Sunday the Humanist Community had its Human Light celebration , with lots of food and a show called the “ Free Thought Follies . ”
“ It ’s our version of Christmas , ” said Armineh Noravian , ﻿group president .
“ We do n’t pray .
We eat and have fun . ”
As a lifelong Methodist , I love the religious meaning of Christmas .
I need the shepherds and the baby in the manger .
But it ’s also a secular family holiday .
And a bloated spend - fest that lasts from the day after Halloween , when the store decorations go up , through the year - end final clearance sales .
Atheists are welcome to join in the fun .
This year , the local humanists had something special to celebrate at their Human Light party .
They are among seven atheist and agnostic organizations launching the Silicon Valley Coalition of Reason .
It ’s part of a nationwide campaign aimed at raising the profile of nonbelievers and showing the public that godless does n’t mean goodless .
Find out more at www.SiliconValleyCOR.org.
“ We want people to know that we are just like everybody else , ” Jackson said .
“ We have more in common than we have points of disagreement . ”
So what ’s the atheist agenda ?
Are they out to control the country ?
Remove “ In God We Trust ” from the dollar bill ?
Make churches pay taxes ?
Jackson laughed .
“ It ’s more a matter of letting people know we ’re around , ” he said .
“ Most people think free thinkers are an irrelevant group , but we are 15 to 17 percent of the population . ”
While I ’ve gone through a couple of agnostic phases and still struggle to understand what God is , my faith gives me comfort and provides meaning for my life .
So I was curious to know where atheists find meaning in their lives .
Jackson said he finds all the meaning he needs in nature and in people .
“ Human beings are the ultimate reference system , ” he said .
“ How do we build a better society ?
How do we support one another to make our lives less painful and more comfortable ?
We are the ones who must come up with the answers to those questions . ”
Mark Thomas is founder of Atheists of Silicon Valley , another group in the coalition .
He can argue at length that God does n’t exist , using quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity .
But when asked about the meaning of life , he had a surprisingly simple answer :
“ Love . Helping others . ”
Humans are a social species , he said .
“ We need each other .
We do n’t survive alone very well . ”
Thomas sees why I find comfort in believing God exists .
But it bugs him when believers use God as a reason to wage war or curb scientific inquiry .
“ There is no atheist agenda , ” he said .
“ We are just trying to make the world a little happier .
How can you be mad at people who are supporting love ? ”
I think we can all agree that love is a good reason for living , especially this time of year .
So I ’ll keep the atheists in my prayers .

According to American popular intellectual Glenn Beck , " Net Neutrality " is a Marxist plot to control content , on the internet , by which he means that the jackbooted Obama storm troopers want to take away your World Net Daily .
Look , you have a brain , we do n't need to explain how stupid and precisely backwards this " net neutrality is government control of content " argument is .
We just need to point out that among the many groups supporting net neutrality are the Christian Coalition , the Gun Owners of America , and Brent Bozell 's Parents Television Council .
All of them are in on the plot !
Everyone 's a Marxist now !
( Except the Maoists .
It is an important distinction that only Glenn Beck can make with any accuracy . )
And Glenn Beck is apparently running out of ways to scare people .
Net neutrality ?
Did Glenn just pick this one to take on because he knew it'd piss off the internet ?
Desperation grabs for revenue are nothing new in politics , but California is once again leading the way in creative financing .
To help close yet another gaping budget deficit , now estimated to be $ 7 billion this year and reach as high as $ 20 billion next , Sacramento lawmakers have authorized a 10 % increase in the amount of taxes withheld from worker paychecks starting November 1 and through 2010 .
The extra withholding tax will reduce Californians ' take - home pay by about $ 1.7 billion for the year .

The local paper covering Findlay , Ohio , has secured its place in journalistic history by printing a brief report of a woman who rang cops to complain that her daughter boasted superior oral relief skills .
TheCourier.com explained on Monday : " A woman called the police early Saturday morning during an argument with her husband after he claimed that the woman 's daughter performed oral sex on him , and the daughter was better at it . "
We hasten to point out that the husband was in fact the stepdad of the orally - skilled lass , but that legally - crucial fact was lost on the readers who queued up to slam The Courier 's coverage .
One wrote : " I subscribe to The Courier but will cancel if the public record is going to be filled with details of multiple female family members servicing the male of the house . "
Well quite .
Interestingly , none of the good burghers of Findlay chose to express their disgust at the news that a woman " was cited early Sunday morning for having an open container of rum and Coke on a sidewalk in the 1200 block of Morey Avenue " , or that someone " at the Wayside Golf Course on Ohio 568 reported that someone damaged one of the holes on the green and stole one of the tee markers " , or indeed that a legless woman " passed out in Nino 's Bar on Main Street early Sunday morning " and " vomited everywhere , and other bar patrons got into a fight while trying to help her " .
Ah , Findlay : it 's our kind of town . ®
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) , the congressman who gained nationwide fame after declaring that the Republican plan for health care amounts to hoping that people “ die quickly , ” has a few choice words — or , rather , one choice acronym — for former Vice President Dick Cheney : “ STFU . ”
For those not familiar with the expression , that ’s Internet parlance for “ shut the fuck up . ”

Grayson made the comment during an interview on MSNBC ’s Hardball Wednesday night .
Host Chris Matthews had asked the Florida congressman about Cheney ’s comments on Fox News Tuesday , in which the former VP called Obama a “ radical ” and said the president ’s decision to bring accused 9/11 plotters to Manhattan to face trial was “ a huge mistake . ”
“ On the Internet there ’s an acronym that ’s used to apply to situations like this .
It ’s called ‘ STFU , ' ” Grayson told Matthews .
“ I do n’t think I can say that on the air , but I think you know what that means . ”
“ Well give me the first part , ” Matthews asked .
“ Shut , ” Grayson responded .
“ Oh , I gotcha , ” Matthews said .
“ Stop talking , in crude language .
Well , I do n’t think you ’re going to get [ Cheney ] to do that . ”
Later in the segment , Grayson responded to the controversy over President Obama ’s bow to the Japanese emperor .

“ I remember [ President George W. Bush ] kissing [ Saudi Crown ]
Prince Abdullah on the cheek , and then holding his hand for an extended period of time , ” Grayson said .
“ Maybe if he ’d let him get to second base , then gasoline would be a dollar a gallon . ”
That quip drew a quick rebuke from the Republican party , which quickly showed it ’s willing to fight at Grayson ’s level .
Eric Kleefeld at TalkingPointsMemo quoted Andy Sere of the National Republican Congressional Committee : “ ” The foul mouthed man-child from Orlando is at it again , taking to the airwaves to bring shame to struggling Central Florida families who want jobs , not nut - jobs .
But speaking of bases , Alan Grayson ’s constituents surely find themselves wishing his parents had never gotten past first . ”

The debate about how much oil is left and recoverable in the world has brought increasing attention to the recovery of oil and natural gas from offshore .
And while I suspect that most of those who comment on this site are very familiar with all the terms , some of the more general readership may not be .
Let me , therefore , explain just a bit about some of the different words that are being used here - with references and videos , where I can find them - to pictures of the different types of structures that are being used .
And if I miss some , please chip in either to ask or answer .
Previous posts in this series can be found at the tech talk link .
Just as on land , we need some form of drilling rig if we are going to drive a bit down through the rock and find us some oil .
But , unless we are working somewhere like the North Slope where we can wait until the sea freezes over and drive ice roads out to build islands to drill from , we are going to have to find a different way of providing the infrastructure support for that bit .
And here is the first distinction - because a drilling rig , in the offshore sense , is more of an exploratory tool , going out to find oil , rather that developing the known fields and bringing in production .
That latter task is left more to production platforms , which can be sited where best to drain the field , and may not even use the initial holes drilled by the exploration rig .
As you may have read the Minerals Management Service keeps track of production offshore ( as well as on Indian lands ) and lest you think that it is not that significant a bunch of folks , they have just handed out $ 10.68 billion in 2009 .
Of the $ 10.68 billion , $ 1.99 billion was disbursed directly to states and eligible political subdivisions such as counties and parishes .
Another $ 5.74 billion was disbursed to the U.S. Treasury ; $ 449 million was disbursed to 34 American Indian Tribes and 30,000 individual American Indian mineral owners ; $ 1.45 billion was contributed to the Reclamation Fund for water projects ; and $ 899 million went to the Land & Water Conservation Fund , along with $ 150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund .
As with many departments of the Administration the MMS is focusing on
the importance of renewable energy and job creation , climate impact and adaptation , and efforts to support and maintain the treasured landscapes of America in the emerging clean energy economy .
Since it also controls ( for the Secretary of the Interior ) lease sales – with a large upcoming one in the Gulf it is a good site to check on periodically .
Now to get back to what we ’re going to do to get the oil / gas out if we are fortunate enough to get one of those leases .
In really shallow water , or the bayous , you might launch your bit from a drilling barge , where the derrick can be assembled once the barge has been towed to the right place .
Barges can be flooded to rest on the seabed in relatively shallow operations .
However they are very susceptible to bad weather , and last April one had to be raised after being sunk during Hurricane Gustav .
Raising a sunken drilling barge
So , as one moves further offshore , then one might use a self - erecting tender from a barge , but would more likely move to something which could get the drilling floor stabilized and up above the waves .
These are the jack - up rigs .
Model of a jack - up rig ( Stavanger Oil Museum )
Typically they have three legs , that are raised as the rig moves around .
Then when it has reached the desired site , the legs are lowered to rest on the sea floor and the entire structure jacks itself up out of the sea , and , hopefully , above the waves .
( You can get a paper model to cut out and assemble for this rig ) .
There is also an animated video showing the installation of a rig at a site .
They can do this to work in depths to around 500 ft .
The discussion about damaged rigs gave links to the different rigs that have been damaged , and some of these have photos of the rigs in better days .
As one goes out to deeper depths , then one will look for a more substantial vessel and so one comes to the Semi-submersible .
Semi-submersible drilling rig ( Stavenger Oil Museum )
These are built to either sail themselves , or to be towed out to the site , with the assembly floating , and then fluid is pumped into the bottom tanks to partially submerge the vessel and thus stabilize it .
One can get some idea of the size of these from some of the photos shown where , ( thanks to Ed Ames ) , wikipedia covers the subject .
Semi-submersible rig off Brazil ( Wikipedia )
Since these are floating there has to be a way of holding them in place .
One way is to have them dynamically positioned , using thrusters to hold them in position , such as these .
Thrusters that go under the pontoons to stabilize a semi-submersible ( Wartsila )
Note that it takes about 3 years to build such a unit .
The alternative is to have the rig attached to anchors on the sea bed using cables , or tethers .
( And for those interested in natural gas production , note that the same rigs are used for both ) .
Cables with controlled winches to stabilize a semi- submersible rig ( Stavanger Oil Museum )
The connection between the well and the platform now becomes more flexible and special connecting pipes called risers are designed to reach from the blow - out preventer ( BOP ) at the top of the well , but on the seabed , and the platform .
These must allow the rig to rise and fall with the tides and so models of behavior have to be written to design ways of allowing this .
An alternative is to use a drillship to do the exploration .
The drillship has the rig mounted in the middle of the ship , and can thus move around somewhat more easily than the others .
It is generally held in position by dynamic positioning while drilling .
( Video here ) .
Drill ship ( Stavanger Oil Museum )
Once the field has been established , then a larger production platform can be brought out and placed where it can , using directional drilling , reach the best places to extract oil from the field .
It is these large structures , such as that the Orlan platform from which Sakhalin Island oil finally began to flow recently , or the Thunder Horse , or Mars platforms .
Although the former was due to produce by 2005 , it was delayed by damage from Dennis and did not get up into major production until the end of last year , while the Mars platform was extensively damaged by Katrina .
it is now back in production .
One of the problems with using these large platforms for Deepwater recovery is that they focus collection and so when these two are disabled , for example , they take about 400,000 bd out of production .
And once they are damaged they are not so easily replaced .
Back when I first wrote on this subject , in 2005 demand for rigs so strong that , as the International Herald Tribune reported
" If a customer comes today with an order , he 'll have to wait until 2009 for delivery , " Choo said in an interview last week .
" That 's how busy we are .
If he 's willing to pay more , he can get a rig by 2008 from our American shipyard . "
By 2008 demand was such that prices had risen to half a billion dollars for a drill ship .
The original article noted that while it may only take 2 years to build a rig , the yard could only work on 8 at a time , and thus current deliveries were for 2009 .
The more recent story notes :
As a result , drilling costs for some of the newest deepwater rigs in the Gulf of Mexico — the nation ’s top source of domestic oil and natural gas supplies — have reached about $ 600,000 a day , compared with $ 150,000 a day in 2002 .
These record prices have spurred a new wave of drill - ship construction .
This boom could lead to renewed offshore oil exploration that would eventually bring more supplies to the oil market , and push down prices .
Already , 16 new drill - ships are scheduled to be delivered to oil companies this year — more than double the number delivered over the last six years combined .
In fact , 75 ultra - deepwater rigs should be delivered from 2008 to 2011 , according to ODS - Petrodata , a firm that tracks drilling rigs .
The Chinese have also introduced a new design which is circular .
The Sevan Driller is the world ’s first of its kind , with the most advanced deep - water drilling capabilities that allow it to drill wells of up to almost 13,500 metres ( 40,000 feet ) in water depths of up to nearly 4,200 metres ( 12,500 feet ) and an internal storage capacity of up to 150,000 barrels of oil .
The owner is Sevan Marine .
The construction of this rig started at COSCO Nantong Shipyard in May 2007 and was relocated to COSCO ’s Qidong Shipyard in April for derrick erection and final commissioning activities .
The rig is due for delivery in the third quarter of this year and will be deployed by Petrobras in the Santos Basin , off the Brazilian coastline .
As of last week it was on its way to Brazil ( which takes about 75 – 80 days ) where it will drill in the Campos Basin in just over a mile of water .
Again this is a very , very brief and simplified look at some of the ways oil and gas can be produced from under the sea .
It barely touches on some of the difficulties that are encountered , however .
The sinking of the one barge shown at the top of the post could have been also repeated with pictures of other rigs in storms , and in battered condition .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The problematic intersection of health care and abortion politics will be highlighted again Monday as religious abortion rights supporters demand changes to reform legislation recently passed by the House of Representatives .
Members of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice will hold a news conference calling on the Senate to alter language in the House bill that places explicit restrictions on federal funding for abortion .
" Our health care system should be inclusive and respectful of diverse religious beliefs and decisions regarding childbearing , " the group said in a statement .
" A health care system that serves all persons with dignity and equality will include comprehensive reproductive health services . "
The coalition is an umbrella organization comprised of representatives of a variety of progressive Catholic , Protestant , Jewish and other groups .
Religious leaders have been split over the issue of abortion coverage .
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops pushed successfully to amend the House bill to prohibit abortion coverage in a government - run health insurance plan , as well as in private plans that accept anyone using government subsidies to buy insurance coverage .
Current law restricts federal funding for abortions to cases of rape , incest or to save the life of the mother .
Under the House bill , people would be permitted to buy supplemental coverage for abortions with their own money .
Abortion rights groups have called the idea discriminatory and preposterous , arguing that women rarely plan ahead for an abortion .
" Health care reform must not be misused as an opportunity to restrict women 's access to reproductive health services , " 90 House Democrats opposed to the amended abortion language wrote in a letter to President Obama last week .
In an example of the complicated politics of the issue , all but one of the House Democrats who signed the letter had voted to pass the overall health care bill even though it contained the amendment they opposed .
Their strategy now is to work with Obama and Senate Democrats to prevent inclusion of the language of the amendment from a final health care bill .
In an interview broadcast Sunday on CNN's " State of the Union , " presidential adviser David Axelrod said the House bill as currently worded goes further than Obama 's stated wishes .
" The president has said repeatedly , and he said in his speech to Congress , that he does n't believe that this bill should change the status quo as it relates to the issue of abortion , " Axelrod said .
" I think it 's fair to say the bill Congress passed does change the status quo . "
However , Axelrod dodged the question of whether Obama would veto a final bill that included the same language as the House bill .
Anti-abortion Senate Democrats say they will seek strict funding restrictions for abortion when the Senate debates its own version of the bill in coming weeks .
" Now , whether the House formula has got it quite right or not , that 's open to debate , " Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota said Sunday on CNN .
" But what is clear is , to have legislation passed -- it was clear in the House ; it will be clear in the Senate -- there can not be taxpayer funding of abortion . "

WHAT DOES A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY DO ?
Thousands are unfairly accused and convicted of crimes .
Why ?
Because the system puts you at a disadvantage .
You are up against government funded prosecutors and juries that assume guilt .
A skilled criminal defense attorney will level the playing field .
Any criminal case carries with it the risk of incarceration , even if you have a clean record .
Your arrest fingerprints , mugshot , and even arrest record could be discovered by others .
A conviction could lead to jail time and give future employers , organizations , governments even potential landlords the ability to deny employment , licenses , travel , and benefits .
Saying the wrong thing in court can multiply these consequences .
DEFENSE IS ALL WE DO .
When we fight back , we carefully consider ways to reverse these consequences so you can get back to your life .
Our absolute understanding of Ohio ’s criminal law allows us to scour every detail for loopholes , technicalities , and procedural errors to establish grounds for a complete dismissal or reduction in charges .
We ’re prepared to send someone to speak with witnesses , analyze evidence , and file legal motions to get your charges reduced or dismissed where possible .
If your case proceeds to trial , we ’re prepared to cross-examine the government ’s witnesses and forcefully argue for an acquittal .
Many Americans are not buying the recent stock market rally .
This is being reflected in multiple polls showing negative attitudes towards the economy and Wall Street .
Wall Street is so disconnected from the average American that they fail to see the 27 million unemployed and underemployed Americans that now have a harder time believing the gospel of financial engineering prosperity .
Americans have a reason to be dubious regarding the recovery because jobs are the main push for most Americans .
A recent study shows that over 70 percent of Americans derive their monthly income from an actual W - 2 job .
In other words , working is the prime mover and source of their income .
Yet the financial elite have very little understanding of this concept .
Why ?
42 percent of financial wealth is controlled by the top 1 percent .
We would need to go back to the Great Depression to see such lopsided data .
Many Americans are still struggling at the depths of this recession .
We have 37 million Americans on food stamps and many wait until midnight of the last day of the month so checks can clear to buy food at Wal - Mart .
Do you think these people are starring at the stock market ?
The overall data is much worse :
Source : William Domhoff
If we break the data down further we will find that 93 percent of all financial wealth is controlled by the top 10 percent of the country .
That is why these people are cheering their one cent share increase while layoffs keep on improving the bottom line .
But what bottom line are we talking about here ?
The Wall Street crowd would like you to believe that all is now good that the stock market has rallied 60 + percent .
Of course they are happy because they control most of this wealth .
Yet the typical American still has negative views on the economy because they actually have to work to earn a living :
The above daily poll asks Americans about their view on the health of the economy .
Only 13 percent believe the economy is good or excellent .
Funny how that correlates with the top 10 percent who control 93 percent of wealth .
Many Americans were sold the illusion of the bubble .
They were sold on the idea that their homes were worth so much more than they really were .
And many used this phony wealth effect to go out and spend beyond their means .
They started spending as if they were part of this elite 10 percent crowd .
But once the tide rolled out , it was clear they were not .
And the horribly built bailouts demonstrate who is controlling our political system .
This was not the rule of a capitalist system but a corporate run government .
Just think about the bailouts and which companies were saved .
We ended up bailing out the worst performing and troubled companies thus keeping alive companies that should have completely failed .
Did we bail out Google ?
Proctor and Gamble ?
Of course not .
These companies actually produce something that people want .
Banks and especially the Wall Street kind merely keep that 42 percent happy by making sure their stock values stay high so they can keep on making money while the average Americans is sold up the river .
Yet many were brought into the easy money fold by going into massive amounts of debt .
And who has most of the debt ?
That is right , the average American :
The bottom 90 percent have been saddled with 73 percent of all debt .
In other words much of their so - called wealth is connected to debt .
Debt is slavery for many especially with egregious credit card companies taking people out with absurd credit card tricks and scams .
Yet the corporate propaganda machine is strong and mighty .
Have you ever received an inheritance ?
A large one ?
Probably not because only 1.6 % of all Americans receive an inheritance larger than $ 100,000 .
If this is the case , why in the world do politicians worry so much about the tax impacts of this ?
Because they want to keep the corporatocracy alive and well so their spawn can get a piece of their pie .
They give the illusion to average Americans that if you only work hard enough you too can join this elusive club of cronies .
The data shows otherwise .
But if we start looking at investment assets , the true wealth in the country , we start realizing why Wall Street is all giddy about the recent stock market government induced rally :
Of investment assets 90 percent of Americans own 12.2 percent .
The rest goes to the top 10 percent .
Welcome to the new serfdom .
The bailouts that went out to the filthy rich were more about protecting their tiny corner of the world than actually making the economy better .
That is why it is interesting to see companies fire people and Wall Street cheer for the increase in earnings per share .
Good for the few at the expense of the many .
Yet the propaganda out of Wall Street and our government is what is good for Wall Street is good for you .
Just like that 1.6 % inheritance issue , the vast majority of Americans wo n’t deal with that and their primary concern is simply a job .
A job that has provided stagnant wages for a decade while the ultra wealth get richer and richer in a phony form of corporate socialism .
If you break down the data you realize that most Americans do n’t have time to speculate in stock markets :
Only 34 % of U.S. households make more than $ 65,000 per year .
What is that after taxes ?
Let us use a state like California for example :
Now if we breakdown this data further you will realize that most of the money is consumed by cost of living necessities , not Wall Street speculation .
Just to show this example let us look at a family budget for someone in California making $ 100,000 :
Notice after running the budget we are in the hole for $ 1,000 ?
That is because of many costs that typical families have .
We can debate the merits of where they are spending money but the point is this ; are these people really making beaucoup money from the stock market ?
They are putting away $ 12,000 a year into their 401k .
As we have now found out , 8 percent a year is never guaranteed in the stock market although the corporate powers would like you to believe that so they can have other suckers to unload stocks onto .
“ Yet the median household income in the U.S. is $ 50,000 and not $ 100,000 .
They have even less to invest . ”
They are more concerned on working to have a paycheck to pay for necessities .
They are more concerned about paying their house off by the time they retire and hopefully , have a little bit of retirement funds coming in .
The sad fact is most Americans rely on Social Security when they retire .
All those ads of unlimited golf and daily trips to Tahiti are propaganda of how Wall Street lives and they want to sell you the sizzle , and clearly not the steak .
They live their lives paper pushing and sucking the life out of the productive part of our economy .
The average American should now realize this since this financial crisis was primarily caused by them .
They are now on a massive campaign to blame Americans for this .
This is hypocrisy to the next level .
Many Americans have paid for their mistake by losing their home through foreclosure .
We have 300,000 foreclosure filings a month .
Many have taken a hit to their overall stock portfolio ( if they have one ) .
Yet the corporate cronies have protected their horrible economy crushing debts at the taxpayer expense .
Unlike you , many hold bonds on the companies and not common stock like many Americans .
Bondholders have been protected at all costs during this crisis .
Goldman Sachs through AIG received 100 cents on the dollar for their horrible bets .
The banks have unlimited back stops thanks to taxpayers .
This is how the top 1 percent rule the new feudal state .
Welcome to the 2010 serfdom .
Time to wake up and restructure the system .
Many people are starting to wake up to this massive scam .

John Greenlee has targeted the Great American Lawn - that notorious sink of fossil fuels , water , chemicals and spare time - for destruction .
" The revolution is clearly on , " he says , adding : " It 's a one - garden - at - a - time revolution . "
With his manifesto " The American Meadow Garden , " sumptuously illustrated by Novato photographer Saxon Holt and published this month by Timber Press , Greenlee is hoping to reach lawn owners ready to change .
" I get what lawn does from a design standpoint ; it 's a cool place for your eye to rest , " he says .
" But if you do n't have to play golf on it , there are all these other great things you could consider .
I drive out to the suburbs and see hundred - to 800 - hundred - foot square rugs of turfgrass in various stages of looking crummy .
You have to water , weed , fertilize , plug and spray them .
Maybe your kids have moved out , the shade trees have grown up , the lawn 's not looking all that good .
Why have a crappy lawn when you can have a fabulous meadow ? "
Unlike such grassland ecosystems as savannah , prairie and veldt , there is no scientific definition of a meadow .
" A meadow is whatever you want it to be , " Greenlee says .
" It 's one of the most exciting new directions in horticulture and design .
You could n't have made the gardens in the book 10 years ago , even five years ago , because no nurseries were growing the plants . "
In the book , Greenlee , a pioneering nurseryman and designer who lives in Brisbane , recounts his own fascination with meadow gardening and describes exemplary natural meadows , from coastal grasslands and the Sierra to Midwestern prairies and Southern pine savannahs .
He provides design ideas and suggests combinations of grasses and compatible accent plants for different kinds of meadows .
One chapter catalogs grasses and grasslike plants now available in the horticultural trade ; another showcases outstanding domestic meadows , including some of Greenlee 's own designs .
West Coast view
With practical guidelines for installation and maintenance , this is the rare species of garden book with a continentwide scope from a West Coast point of view .
" Mine is one of the first grass books that talk about what requires winter chill .
The grasses you see in garden magazines do n't work in a Mediterranean environment like ours . "
Another notable difference here is that fall - right now - is an ideal time to plant .
Maintenance is a big selling point .
" A sedge lawn needs mowing maybe four times a year and watering once a week in the hottest part of summer ; turfgreases need weekly watering and 40 mowings a year , " Greenlee said .
But that 's not the only argument for the natural meadow : " If my book converts 10 percent of California gardens into meadows , that 's amazing ecological savings .
Consider the habitat you 're creating .
People think of habitat as being down the road at the state park , but your yard can be habitat for an endangered butterfly . "
Meadows offer endless aesthetic possibilities : " Grasses soften the landscape , " Greenlee says .
" They 're a fairly neutral design element . "
Grasses are compatible with roses in a cottage meadow or , for a different feel , succulents .
" Adding Mediterranean bulbs , babianas , freesias or species tulips creates flowering panels that are sustainable and beautiful .
You can have golden foliage , or grasses that reflect light . "
Greenlee finds meadows work in small spaces as well as large estates : " The smaller the garden gets , the better it is that it 's a sedge lawn with mixed grasses .
There are small - scale applications on narrow side yards , dog yards or places with tree root competition or tree shade . "
Though he likes to work with native grasses , particularly sedges , Greenlee feels there 's a place in the meadow for better - behaved varieties of problematic species like pampas grass and giant reed .
Still , it can be an uphill battle .
Former neighbors were n't ready to love a meadow that Greenlee planted because it looked " disorderly and weedy , " in contrast to their billiard - table lawns .
" I wear my citations like badges of honor . "
Many such problems have involved prairie plantings : " Maybe the meadow is the place of compromise between the lawn and the prairie . "
Drawing attention
Greenlee 's work has caught the attention of Antonia Adezio , president of the Garden Conservancy , a nonprofit that preserves gardens for education and enjoyment .
" He 's found ways to merge all this plant knowledge into a new style , " she says .
" His work is very timely because we 're all thinking about using less water , not mowing as much , pointing out ways for people to apply those ideas in their gardens . "
Recently transplanted from Pomona to Brisbane , Greenlee has a design studio in San Francisco .
At home , his sedge - based postage - stamp - size meadow surrounds an old pepper tree .
Greenlee said he 's happy to be in Northern California , where people are more receptive to the meadow message , and he 's been able to work with " some of the giants of landscape architecture . "
He 's designing a Persian - carpet garden for a Woodside property .
" My current project is always the favorite , " he said .
His portfolio includes tiger and gorilla enclosures at the San Diego Zoo ( " You think kids are tough on gardens ?
Try gorillas . " ) .
What 's next ?
Greenlee has been thinking about the edible meadow : " The first real agriculture in California was First Nations people diverting streams in the Eastern Sierra to flood nutgrass fields .
How about edible lawns of native nutgrass ?
Someone is working with precursor grains from the Fertile Crescent .
Edible grasses are the next phase .
" I like to win people over with a message of love :
Is n't this just so much more visually satisfying than a lawn ? "
The US Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) ran at least two secret detention facilities in the Baltic nation of Lithuania , a parliamentary inquiry has found .
The sites were set up by Lithuanian intelligence services for the CIA , according to the report published on Tuesday .
But the head of the inquiry said he was not able to confirm whether al - Qaeda suspects had ever been interrogated at either location .

“ The sites existed … and planes landed , ” Arvydas Anusauskas , the head of parliament ’s national security and defence committee , told reporters .
“ Regarding the ‘ cargo ’ , I ca n’t confirm anything , because Lithuanian authorities could not carry out the usual checks , so what was being transported was unknown . ”
Lithuania ’s parliament called for an investigation after the US television channel ABC alleged that the former Soviet republic had hosted a CIA “ black site ” for a small number of captives .
ABC News said that the facility near the airport in Vilnius , the Lithuanian capital , operated from early 2004 to late 2005 and that CIA aircraft brought high - level al - Qaeda suspects to the jail .
“ The first project was developed from 2002 .
In response to the wishes of our partners and the conditions that were imposed , the site was meant to host one person .
The second site was created in 2004 , ” Anusauskas said .

The second site is believed to have been a converted riding school in the hamlet of Antaviliai , about 20 km from Vilnius .
It was purchased in March 2004 by a US - registered firm Elite LLC , which is purportedly a CIA front .
“ The lay - out of the buildings , their secret nature , the fence around the site , plus the only sporadic visits by VSD [ Lithuanian intelligence service ] operatives , enabled our partners to carry out activities without VSD control and to use the place however they liked , ” Anusauskas said .
The investigation also found that five aircraft linked to the CIA landed in Lithuania between 2003 and 2006 , and that local intelligence officials prevented customs and border guards from inspecting them .
ADVERTISEMENT
Anusauskas said that senior officials were not informed about the secret jails and there had been no government approval given for the sites .
“ The biggest concern comes from the fact that a few agents , without consulting the head of state , took a decision that breached the law , ” he said , adding that “ the VSD became a state within a state ” .

Valdas Adamkus , who was president for much of the period that the secret facilities operated , dismissed the findings .
“ I am certain this never happened and nobody proved me wrong , ” he told the Baltic News Service .
But Andrius Kubilius , the Lithuanian prime minister , said it was “ a matter of great concern ” that such infrastructure existed and that it could be possible to detain suspected terrorists without government control .

In a 2007 investigation , conducted on behalf of the Council of Europe , Dick Marty , a Swiss politician accused 14 European governments of permitting the CIA to run detention centers or carry out rendition flights between 2002 and 2005 .

It is hard to believe that almost ten years have passed since the Sony Playstation began to make its transition into the Playstation 2 era .
However , before the Playstation saw its last years as one of the dominant systems of the 1990s , it saw the release of Final Fantasy IX , the last numbered title of the series in the twentieth century and marked the beginning of a new age in the series .
Following its great successes with the previous numbered titles , Final Fantasy VII and VIII , Squaresoft , the predecessor of Square - Enix , decided to make the final title of the Playstation a reflection of the traditional Final Fantasy games from the past .
Unlike the dark , complex story lines of the series ’ two previous titles , Final Fantasy IX returned to its original fantasy theme , which became the trademark of the series .
Final Fantasy
IX brought back the medieval - style backdrop and storyline that had been so commonplace throughout the progression of the series .
FF
IX takes gamers to the world of Gaia and the kingdom of Alexandria where you step into the shoes of Zidane , a thief and actor of the Tantalus theater troupe , who are on their way to the city of Alexandria to perform the kingdom ’s popular play , “ I Want to Be Your Canary , ” in celebration of Princess Garnet ’s sixteenth birthday .
However , their real plan was to kidnap the princess and bring her to the Regency of Lindblum for fear of her safety under her power - hungry adopted mother , Queen Brahne .
In true Final Fantasy fashion , the story becomes more complex than the initial assumption .
In fact , Queen Brahne is merely a pawn for the main antagonist , Kuja , who wants the ability to control eidolons to destroy his controller , Garland — the guardian of the world of Terra .
In order to accomplish this , Kuja supplied the queen with the technology to create soulless Black Mages in order to fuel her ambitions of conquering her neighbors and throw the world into chaos .
Along the way , players will notice the depth of each character as they struggle to find their unique identities and role in the world .
For example , Vivi , a black mage who is self - aware , tries to understand the reason of his existence and how to come to grips with himself .
As with its past games , the series again excelled in the extent and depth of story in FFIX .
In addition to returning to the traditional storyline formula of the past Final Fantasy games , Square also revived the old character class system that had been so common among its previous installments , with the exception of VII and VIII .
Each character is assigned to a certain role in battle , such as white mage , black mage , thief , knight , blue mage , etc .
This may seem like a step backwards compared to the open - ended possibilities of the previous two titles , but it works as it had with the older , traditional Final Fantasy games .
Another feature worth noting is the return to simplicity of equipment and support abilities .
Weapons and armor include special character abilities , which the character may use once the item is equipped depending on their specific class .
Once the character accumulates enough ability points in battle , the ability becomes usable without having to keep the item equipped .
The game play is pretty generic Final Fantasy ; the player navigates a character throughout the game world , exploring areas and interacting with NPCs .
In some parts of the story , the game allows players to play as some of the NPCs such as Beatrix and the members of Tantalus allowing for greater diversity and a more interesting experience .
To aid exploration on the field screen , Final Fantasy IX introduced the “ field icon ” , an exclamation mark appearing over their lead character ’s head , signaling that an item or sign is nearby .
Players speak with the ever familiar moogles to save their progress , restore life energy with a tent , and purchase items , a deviation from previous installments , which used a save point to perform these functions .
Another new feature is Mognet , where Moogles may request that the playable character deliver letters to other Moogles .
This gives the story a distinct perspective from other creatures as well as a touch of a comical relief .
Like previous Final Fantasy games , combat is wrought with random enemy encounters as players progress through the game .
On the battle screen , the enemy appears on the opposite side of the characters ; each battle uses the familiar Active Time Battle system that was first featured in Final Fantasy IV .
he character ’s command list is presented in a window opposite the ATB gauge list ; while all characters can physically attack the enemy or use an item from the player ’s inventory , they also possess unique abilities .
These character - specific commands change when the player goes into Trance mode , which is activated for a limited duration when a gauge fills as character sustains damage in a style similar to the Limit Breaks used in Final Fantasy VII .
When the gauge is full , the character ’s strength is greatly increased , and the player can select special attack commands .
The only drawback is the unpredictability of the Trance bar as it can fill up right when one of your other characters makes the final kill , thus ending a battle and wasting your Trance ability .
Unlike FFVII ’s Limit Breaks , filled Trance bars are not carried over to other battles , which could lead to a great deal of frustration .
After a battle , players gain experience points , items , and , of course , Gil to buy new items and equipment .
You may also earn new cards for one of the unique mini-games of Final Fantasy IX called Tetra Master .
As with other Final Fantasy games , mini -games are another integral part .
In Final Fantasy IX , there are two such games : Tetra Master and Chocobo Hot and Cold .
Tetra Master is a card game , which involves two players with a hand of five cards each .
Each card is of a specific monster with vague stats .
The point of the game is to capture as many of your opponent ’s cards as you can .
If you end up with more cards , you win and get to choose one of your opponent ’s cards as a prize .
However , if you manage to capture his entire hand , you get all five of his cards .
The frustrating part is the vague rules associated with the game .
The stats of each card is hard to determine and in some instances , the card battles are based on chance and what picture on each card looks more intimidating .
Chocobo Hot and Cold is a simple game of hot and cold .
Throughout Gaia , players will find Chocobo - friendly areas that allow you to dig for treasure with the help of Choco , your adopted Chocobo friend .
In order to find the location of treasures , players will need to play Hot and Cold to find treasure maps called Chocographs .
These chocobo treasure hunts allow players to further explore the world map as well as find rare items that may prove useful later in the game .
Final Fantasy
IX also saw the last time that the series would utilize an open world map that allowed players to explore freely , which was one of the biggest features that made the games attractive to many players .
In the world map , players can freely navigate around the various lands of the world unless restricted by terrain , such as water or mountains .
To overcome geographical limitations , players can ride chocobos , sail on a boat , or freely pilot airships , a feature that would disappear in subsequent games .
Last but not least , Final Fantasy
IX has one of the most memorable and extensive soundtracks composed by none other than Nobuo Uematsu , who has been the face of the series ’s music for more than a decade .
Final Fantasy IX was his last exclusive Final Fantasy score .
Originally , it was supposed to be about ten tracks , but Uematsu spent an estimated year composing and producing around 160 pieces for Final Fantasy IX , with 140 appearing in the game .
Most of the pieces heard throughout the game are influenced from medieval music , but Uematsu also drew from old Final Fantasy scores , most notable of these tunes is “ Rufus ’s Welcoming Ceremony ” from Final Fantasy VII , which was played by the Tantalus band early in the game .
With a combination of dark and light tunes , the Uematsu ’s composition enhances the game , making it entertaining and pleasing to the ears .
Overall , Final Fantasy
IX combined the great features of the past to end the series ’s first decade and a half in existence adding in new elements as well .
Although it did not do as well as its two immediate predecessors , it still sold millions of copies around the world and is still replayed by many .
The fusing of a great in - depth story , exciting game play , and music makes this game one of the most noteworthy nostalgic titles of the Playstation era .
For fans and RPG players not familiar with Final Fantasy , it is a must - buy for your classic collection .

US ' first mass killer dies at 88
Unruh never went on trial after being declared criminally insane Howard Barton Unruh , who shot and killed 13 people as he walked the streets of New Jersey 60 years ago , has died at the age of 88 .
Diagnosed as mentally ill , he never stood trial .
He is widely regarded by many as the first single - episode mass murderer in the United States .
Unruh , who was confined in a state psychiatric hospital after the rampage , died on Monday after a long illness .
Unruh had planned whom he was going to shoot for up to a year beforehand .
Howard Unruh , who was 28 years old at the time of the massacre on the morning of 6 September 1949 , openly confessed .
Although judged mentally competent he never stood trial , after being diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic .
Murder journal
He was categorised as criminally insane , becoming immune from prosecution .
In total Unruh killed five men , five women as well as three young children in New Jersey 's Camden area .
An honourably discharged World War II combat veteran and pharmacy student , he had kept a journal of his intended victims for up to a year before the shootings .
Those he killed were either intentionally targeted , or were merely unlucky enough to have been in his way .
An expert marksman , Unruh executed his massacre plot in the blue - collar neighbourhood with calm precision .
Those he gunned down included a cobbler , a barber , some neighbours who had complained about him playing loud music , and a three - year - old boy peeking out of a window .
A tailor on Unruh 's death - list had left his shop on an errand , so he shot the man 's bride of six weeks instead , ignoring her pleas for her life .
Unruh - who had been sharing an apartment with his mother at the time of the massacre - told police he was convinced his neighbours were plotting against him .
" [ The neighbours ] had been making derogatory remarks about my character , " Unruh told detectives at the time .
He was described as a recluse who liked to read the Bible and had a passion for guns .
The pistol used in the shootings was a German Luger , a souvenir Unruh had kept following his time in the US armed services as a tank gunner .

Wind Mobile , Canada 's new major cellphone provider , will open stores and announce its service plans Wednesday .
The company , fresh off receiving the federal government 's blessing on Friday to launch its service , said it will announce its handset lineup and pricing plans at a news conference in Toronto on Wednesday morning .
Wind , the brand name to be used by parent Globalive Communications Corp. , said its network is up and running in Toronto and Calgary , with " beta " customers testing it .
The company is opening a host of retail stores in the two cities , as well as kiosks at Blockbuster Video outlets — 13 in the Greater Toronto Area and three in Calgary .
In a statement Monday , the Toronto - based company said " it will provide voice , text and data services to Canadians on a next - generation wireless network and is committed to offering a level of wireless service presently not available in Canada . "
Industry Minister Tony Clement on Friday overruled the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission and found that Globalive is in fact Canadian - owned and - controlled .
The CRTC had ruled in October that Orascom , Globalive 's Egyptian financial backer , wielded too much influence over the upstart , so it could not set up shop in Canada .
Telecommunications laws require network - owning companies to be largely Canadian - owned and - controlled .
The government 's decision provoked mixed reactions .
Consumers cheered the move and welcomed the new competition , while others condemned it as bending the rules .
Opposition politicians said the government should have reviewed the relevant telecommunications laws before allowing Globalive to do business , while the Communication , Energy and Paperworkers Union said the move was a " sellout of Canadian interests . "
Major threat
Globalive has licences for airwaves across the country , except in Quebec , and plans to launch service in other major cities in the next few months .
The company is being seen as a major threat to existing national providers Bell , Rogers and Telus , who lobbied the CRTC and government to prevent its launch .
Globalive on Friday said it would offer a full complement of smartphones , including HTC , Samsung and BlackBerry handsets , as well as portable internet data sticks that can plug into a laptop computer .
Executives said they would not initially carry Apple 's iPhone or any Google Android phones .
Globalive chairman Anthony Lacavera said that although Wind 's business wo n't be based on rock - bottom prices , it will offer better value than its rivals .
Wind will not charge system access or 911 fees , he said .
Other new wireless companies are also set to launch services in the coming months .
Toronto - based DAVE
Wireless has plans to start in several major cities early next year , while Public Mobile , also from Toronto , is looking to launch in Ontario .
Quebecor 's Videotron subsidiary is also planning to start service next year in Quebec .
The Beauty of Roots
John Baez
December 15 , 2011
Around 2006 , my friend Dan Christensen created a fascinating picture of all the roots of all polynomials of degree ≤ 5 with integer coefficients ranging from - 4 to 4 :
Click on the picture for bigger view .
Roots of quadratic polynomials are in grey ; roots of cubics are in cyan ; roots of quartics are in red and roots of quintics are in black .
The horizontal axis of symmetry is the real axis ; the vertical axis of symmetry is the imaginary axis .
The big hole in the middle is centered at 0 ; the next biggest holes are at ±1 , and there are also holes at ±i and all the sixth roots of 1 .
You can see lots of fascinating patterns here , like how the roots of polynomials with integer coefficients tend to avoid integers and roots of unity - except when they land right on these points !
You can see more patterns if you zoom in :
Now you see beautiful feathers surrounding the blank area around the point 1 on the real axis , a hexagonal star around \ ( \exp ( i \pi / 3 ) \ ) , a strange red curve from this point to 1 , smaller stars around other points , and more ....
People should study this sort of thing !
Let 's define the Christensen set \ ( C_{d , n}\ ) to be the set of all roots of all polynomials of degree \ ( d\ ) with integer coefficients ranging from \ ( - n\ ) to \ ( n\ ) .
Clearly \ ( C_{d , n}\ ) gets bigger as we make either \ ( d\ ) or \ ( n\ ) bigger , and it becomes dense in the complex plane as \ ( n\ ) approaches \( \infty\ ) , as long as \ ( d \ge 1\ ) .
We get all the rational complex numbers if we fix \(d \ge 1\ ) and let \( n \ to \infty \ ) , and we get all the algebraic complex numbers if let both \(d , n \to \infty \ ) .
Based on the above picture , there seem to be lots of interesting conjectures to make about what it does as \(d \ to \infty \ ) for fixed \ ( n\ ) .
Inspired by the pictures above , Sam Derbyshire decided to to make a high resolution plot of some roots of polynomials .
After some experimentation , he decided that his favorite were polynomials whose coefficients were all 1 or - 1 ( not 0 ) .
He made a high - resolution plot by computing all the roots of all polynomials of this sort having degree ≤ 24 .
That 's \( 2 ^ {24} \ ) polynomials , and about \( 24 \times 2 ^ { 24} \ ) roots — or about 400 million roots !
It took Mathematica 4 days to generate the coordinates of the roots , producing about 5 gigabytes of data .
He then used some Java programs to create this amazing image :
The coloring shows the density of roots , from black to dark red to yellow to white .
The picture above is a low - resolution version of the original 90 - megabyte file , which you can get here .
We can zoom in to get more detail :
Note the holes at certain roots of unity and the feather - like patterns as we move inside the unit circle .
To see these pattern , let 's zoom in to certain regions , marked here :
Here 's a closeup of the hole at 1 :
Note the white line along the real axis .
That 's because lots more of these polynomials have real roots than nearly real roots .
Next , here 's the hole at i :
And here 's the hole at \( \exp ( i \pi / 4 ) = ( 1 + i )/\sqrt{2} \ ) :
Note how the density of roots increases as we get closer to this point , but then suddenly drops off right next to it .
Note also the subtle patterns in the density of roots .
But the feathery structures as move inside the unit circle are even more beautiful !
Here is what they look near the real axis — this plot is centered at the point 4/5 :
They have a very different character near the point \( ( 4/5 ) i\ ) :
But I think they 're the most beautiful near the point \( ( 1/2 ) \exp ( i /5 ) \ ) .
This image is almost a metaphor of how , in our study of mathematics , patterns emerge from confusion like sharply defined figures looming from the mist :
The patterns I 've just showed you are tantalizing , and at first quite mysterious ... but Jesse C. McKeown and Greg Egan figured out how to understand some of them during the discussion of " week285 " .
The resulting story is quite beautiful !
But this discussion was a bit hard to follow , since it involved smart people figuring out things as they went along .
So , I doubt many people understood it --- at least compared to the number of people who could understand it .
Let me just explain one pattern here .
Why does this region near \( \ frac{1}{2}e^{i/5}\ ) :
look so much like the fractal called a dragon ?
Here 's another , more relevant way to create a dragon .
Take these two functions from the complex plane to itself :
$ $ \displaystyle { f_+ ( x ) = \ frac{ 1+i}{2} x } $ $
$ $ \displaystyle { f_- ( x ) = 1 - \ frac{1 - i}{2} x } $ $
Pick a point in the plane and keep hitting it with either of these functions : you can randomly make up your mind which to use each time .
No matter what choices you make , you 'll get a sequence of points that converges ... and it converges to a point in the dragon !
We can get all points in the dragon this way .
But where did these two functions come from ?
What 's so special about them ?
To get the specific dragon I just showed you , we need these specific functions .
They have the effect of taking the horizontal line segment from the point 0 to the point 1 , and mapping it to the two segments that form the simple picture shown at the far left here :
As we repeatedly apply them , we get more and more segments , which form the ever more fancy curves in this sequence .
But if all we want is some sort of interesting set of points in the plane , we do n't need to use these specific functions .
The most important thing is that our functions be contractions , meaning they reduce distances between points .
Suppose we have two contractions \( f_+ \) and \( f_- \ ) from the plane to itself .
Then there is a unique closed and bounded set \ ( S\ ) in the plane with
$ $ S = f_ + ( S ) \cup f_-( S ) $ $
Moreover , suppose we start with some point \ ( x\ ) in the plane and keep hitting it with \ ( f_+\ ) and / or \( f_ - \ ) , in any way we like .
Then we 'll get a sequence that converges to a point in \ ( S\ ) .
And even better , every point in \ ( S\ ) show up as a limit of a sequence like this .
We can even get them all starting from the same \ ( x\ ) .
All this follows from a famous theorem due to John Hutchinson .
" Cute , " you 're thinking .
" But what does this have to do with roots of polynomials whose coefficients are all 1 or - 1 ? "
Well , we can get polynomials of this type by starting with the number 0 and repeatedly applying these two functions , which depend on a parameter \ ( z\ ) :
$ $ f_ + ( x ) = 1 + z x $ $
$ $ f_-(x ) = 1 - z x $ $
For example :
$ $ f_ + (0 ) = 1 $ $
$ $ f_ + ( f_ + ( 0 ) ) = 1 + z $ $
$ $ f_-( f_ + ( f_ + ( 0 ) ) ) = 1 - z ( 1 + z ) = 1 - z - z ^2 $ $
$ $ f_ + ( f_ -( f_ + ( f_ + ( 0 ) ) ) ) = 1 + z ( 1 - z - z ^2 ) = 1 - z - z ^2 + z^3 $ $
and so on .
All these polynomials have constant term 1 , never - 1 .
But apart from that , we can get all polynomials with coefficients 1 or - 1 using this trick .
So , we get them all up to an overall sign — and that 's good enough for studying their roots .
Now , depending on what \ ( z\ ) is , the functions \( f_+ \ ) and \( f_- \ ) will give us different generalized dragon sets .
We need \( |z| \lt 1 \ ) for these functions to be contraction mappings .
Given that , we get a generalized dragon set in the way I explained .
Let 's call it \ ( S_z\ ) to indicate that it depends on \ ( z\ ) .
Greg Egan drew some of these sets \ ( S_z\ ) .
Here 's one that looks like a dragon :
Here 's one that looks more like a feather :
Near the point z in the complex plane , the set Sam Derbyshire drew looks a bit like the generalized dragon set S z !
The words ' a bit like ' are weasel words , because I do n't know the precise theorem .
If you look at Sam 's picture again :
you 'll see a lot of ' haze ' near the unit circle , which is where \( f_+ \ ) and \( f_- \ ) cease to be contraction mappings .
Outside the unit circle — well , I do n't want to talk about that now !
But inside the unit circle , you should be able to see that I 'm at least roughly right .
For example , if we zoom in near \( z = 0.372 - .542 i\ ) , we get dragons :
which look at least roughly like this :
In fact they should look very much like this , but I 'm too lazy to find the point \( z = 0.372 - .542 i\ ) and zoom in very closely to that point in Sam 's picture , to check !
Similarly , near the point \ ( 0.8 + 0.2 i\ ) , we get feathers :
that look a lot like this :
Again , it would be more convincing if I could exactly locate the point \ ( 0.8 + 0.2 i\ ) and zoom in there .
But I think I can persuade Dan Christensen to do that for me .
There are lots of questions left to answer , like " What about all the black regions in the middle of Sam 's picture ? " and " what about those funny - looking holes near the unit circle ? "
But the most urgent question is this :
If you take the set Sam Derbyshire drew and zoom in near the point z , why should it look like the generalized dragon set S z ?
And the answer was discovered by ' some guy on the street ' — our pseudonymous , nearly anonymous friend .
It 's related to something called the Julia–Mandelbrot correspondence .
I wish I could explain it clearly , but I do n't understand it well enough to do a really convincing job .
So , I 'll just muddle through by copying Greg Egan 's explanation .
First , let 's define a Littlewood polynomial to be one whose coefficients are all 1 or - 1 .
We have already seen that if we take any number \( z\ ) , then we get the image of \ ( z\ ) under all the Littlewood polynomials of degree \ ( n\ ) by starting with the point \( x = 0 \ ) and applying these functions over and over : $ $ f_ + ( x ) = 1 + z x $ $ $ $ f_ -(x ) = 1 - z x $ $ a total of \( n+1 \ ) times .
Moreover , we have seen that as we keep applying these functions over and over to \( x = 0\ ) , we get sequences that converge to points in the generalized dragon set \( S_z\ ) .
So , \( S_z\ ) is the set of limits of sequences that we get by taking the number \ ( z\ ) and applying Littlewood polynomials of larger and larger degree .
Now , suppose 0 is in \( S_z\ ) .
Then there are Littlewood polynomials of large degree applied to \ ( z \ ) that come very close to 0 .
We get a picture like this :
where the arrows represent different Littlewood polynomials being applied to \ ( z\ ) .
If we zoom in close enough that a linear approximation is good , we can see what the inverse image of 0 will look like under these polynomials :
It will look the same !
But these inverse images are just the roots of the Littlewood polynomials .
So the roots of the Littlewood polynomials near \( z \ ) will look like the generalized dragon set \( S_z\ ) .
As Egan put it :
But if we grab all these arrows : and squeeze their tips together so that they all map precisely to 0 — and if we .re working in a small enough neighbourhood of 0 that the arrows don.t really change much as we move them — the pattern that imposes on the tails of the arrows will look a lot like the original pattern :
There 's a lot more to say , but I think I 'll stop soon .
I just want to emphasize that all this is modeled after the incredibly cool relationship between the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets .
It goes like this ;
Consider this function , which depends on a complex parameter \( z\ ) : $ $ f( x ) = x ^2 + z $ $
If we fix \( z\ ) , this function defines a map from the complex plane to itself .
We can start with any number \ ( x\ ) and keep applying this map over and over .
We get a sequence of numbers .
Sometimes this sequence shoots off to infinity and sometimes it does n't .
The boundary of the set where it does n't is called the Julia set for this number \( z\ ) .
On the other hand , we can start with \( x = 0\ ) , and draw the set of numbers \ ( z\ ) for which the resulting sequence does n't shoot off to infinity .
That 's called the Mandelbrot set .
Here 's the cool relationship : in the vicinity of the number \( z\ ) , the Mandelbrot set tends to look like the Julia set for that number \ ( z\ ) .
This is especially true right at the boundary of the Mandelbrot set .
For example , the Julia set for $ $ z = - 0.743643887037151 + 0.131825904205330 i$ $ looks like this :
while this :
is a tiny patch of the Mandelbrot set centered at the same value of \ ( z\ ) .
They 're shockingly similar !
This is why the Mandelbrot set is so complicated .
Julia sets are already very complicated .
But the Mandelbrot set looks like a lot of Julia sets !
It 's like a big picture of someone 's face made of little pictures of different people 's faces .
Here 's a great picture illustrating this fact .
As with all the pictures here , you can click on it for a bigger view :
But this one you really must click on !
It 's a big picture made of lots of little pictures of Julia sets for various values of \ ( z\ ) ... but it mimics the Mandelbrot set .
You 'll notice that the Mandelbrot set is the set of numbers \ ( z\ ) whose Julia sets are connected .
Those Julia sets are the black blobs .
When \( z\ ) leaves the Mandelbrot set , its Julia set falls apart into dust : that 's the white stuff .
For an even better view of this phenomenon , try this :
David Joyce , Mandelbrot and Julia set explorer , http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/julia/explorer.html
You can zoom into the Mandelbrot set and see the corresponding Julia set at various values of \ ( z\ ) .
For example , here 's the Julia set at \(z = - 0.689494949 - 0.462323232 i\ ) :
and here 's a tiny piece of Mandelbrot set near that point :
So , the Mandelbrot set is like an illustrated catalog of Julia sets .
Similarly , it seems the set of roots of Littlewood polynomials ( up to a given degree ) resembles a catalog of generalized dragon sets .
However , making this into a theorem would require me to make precise many things I 've glossed over , and I do n't know how yet .

Firefighting efforts in South Australia will be made easier by reduced temperatures forecast for today .
Emergency services have been working through the night to ensure two fires at Kingston and Port Lincoln do not jump containment lines .
Yesterday the Port Lincoln blaze , on South Australia 's Lower Eyre Peninsula , destroyed 12 houses and nine sheds and several firefighters suffered smoke inhalation .
Power has now been restored to most of the 6,000 homes that were affected by the blaze .
Region Commander Kevin
May says residents are now returning to the area but are advised to take care .
" Some people were moved to a safer area today on advice from the police department but most of those who have lived in the area that have had the fire impinging on them have been allowed to go back home so they can check on their own premises , " he said .
Port Lincoln Mayor Peter Davis says there have been no reports of deaths but he is concerned .
" I should n't be surprised if there 's been loss of life , particularly when it ignited ... that was an explosive situation around three or four hours ago , " he said .
Mr Davis says there has been significant property loss but conditions have eased .
" Clearly there are still hotspots but because the wind speed is below 10 knots it 's moderated enormously , " he said .
' Fleeing for our lives '
At the height of the drama , residents fled Port Lincoln as thick smoke blanketed much of the town .
Port Lincoln resident Ray said he thought his house was among those destroyed .
" I was probably driving out my driveway with flames above the roof of the house at the backdoor , " he said .
" I 'd just like to say to people who are out there on the roads and blocking the roads , people like me are fleeing for our lives you know . "
About 4,000 homes in the area are still without power .
Port Lincoln resident Michael Sleep , who sent photos of the blaze to ABC Online , said the situation in town had been " pretty scary " .
" Wind changed direction and there was smoke everywhere with ash blowing in .
Had to get on the roof and block and fill the gutters , " he said .
CFS spokeswoman Hayley Cahalan said 150 firefighters and 30 fire trucks were used to contain the blaze , as well as water bombing aircraft .
Kingston blaze
Ms Cahalan said fire crews would be back - burning through the night at Kingston to bring the fire there under control .
She said smoke would make travelling in the area dangerous .
Belinda Gibson from the weather bureau said the temperature had eased to about 33 degrees in Port Lincoln .
She said conditions should continue to ease overnight .
" Now that the change has come through Port Lincoln has cooled down .
Down at Kingston I imagine it 's probably cooled down a little bit , " she said .
" The winds should start to be easing back through the evening , increasing humidity and lowering the temperature . "
Rob Sandford from the CFS said sightseers had been a problem in bushfire zones through the day .
" Our message all day today has been for people not to enter the area and not try and leave the area where these fires are because it is just too dangerous , " he said .
" They are putting themselves and the emergency services and the rest of the community at risk . "
More than half of South Australia 's 15 fire ban districts have been subject to catastrophic fire danger ratings today , due to hot and windy weather .

Why bother to type a document using a keyboard when you can write it by simply thinking about the letters you need to type ?
A brain wave study presented at the 2009 annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society shows that people with electrodes in their brains can “ type ” ( input data into a computer ) using just their minds .
Neurologist Jerry Shih , M.D. Shih and other Mayo Clinic researchers worked with Dean Krusienski , Ph.D. , from the University of North Florida in an experiment involving two patients with epilepsy .
Both patients were already being monitored for seizure activity using electrocorticography ( ECoG ) , in which a sheet of electrodes is laid directly on the surface of the brain .
This procedure requires a craniotomy , a surgical incision into the skull .
Dr. Shih and colleagues hypothesized that feedback from electrodes placed directly on the brain would be much more specific than data collected with EEG ( electroencephalography ) alone , in which electrodes are placed on the scalp .
Most studies of mind - machine interaction have occurred with EEG .
" There is a big difference in the quality of information you get from ECoG compared to EEG .
The scalp and bony skull diffuses and distorts the signal , rather like how the Earth ’s atmosphere blurs the light from stars , " says Dr. Shih .
" That ’s why progress to date on developing these kinds of mind interfaces has been slow . "
Dr. Shih ’s patients at the Mayo Clinic were asked to look at a computer screen containing a 6 - by - 6 matrix with a single alphanumeric character inside each square .
Every time the square with a certain letter flashed , the patient focused on it and a computer application recorded the brain ’s response to the flashing letter .
The computer software calibrated the system with the individual patient ’s specific brain wave patterns .
When the patient then focused on a letter , the letter appeared on the screen .
" We were able to consistently predict the desired letters for our patients at or near 100 percent accuracy , " Shih explains .
" While this is comparable to other researchers ’ results with EEGs , this approach is more localized and can potentially provide a faster communication rate . ”
A recent h+ article , “ Mind Reading ( Neuro Decoding ) Goes Mainstream ” ( see Resources ) describes a similar study by Dr. Gerwin Schalk , who worked with patients using ECoG at the Wadsworth Center , in Albany , NY .
The patients were asked to say or imagine words flashed on a screen while their brain activity was recorded .
Schalk ’s team then used specially designed decoder algorithms to predict the vowels and consonants of the word , using only the pattern of brain activity .
They found that both speaking and imagining the word gave roughly the same level of accuracy .
Brain
Wave applications include the ability to “ mind read ” vowels , consonants , and individual letters ; algorithms to turn brain waves into musical scores ; even twittering by thought alone .
In addition to the ability to “ mind read ” vowels , consonants , and individual letters , brain wave applications also include algorithms to turn brain waves into music and even “ tweeting ” ( using the popular Twitter Internet application ) by thought alone .
Brain music therapy is a form of neurofeedback using EEG based on a variable ratio of fast and slow rhythms –- it can be used to turn a person ’s brain waves into music notes using a computerized mathematical formula .
Dr. Galina Mindlin , a neuropsychiatrist with the Brain Music Therapy Center in New York City brought this to the U.S. from Moscow in 2006 as a form of entrainment therapy .
Interviewed on NBC ’s Today Show , she said , “ Brain waves are translated into music digitally with a special algorithm .
Once the brain waves are converted into musical sounds , they are placed on a CD with a relaxing file and activating file and instructions on how to use them . ”
What does this mind - machine interface sound like ?
“ It sounds like classical piano music , ” says Dr. Mindlin .
Here ’s a video showing the use of an EEG mind - machine interface to control sampled sound clips on a piano :
In addition to his ECoG research at the Wadsworth Center , Dr. Gerwin Schalk and his colleagues also worked with University of Wisconsin - Madison biomedical engineering doctoral student Adam Wilson to develop an interface that involves a keyboard displayed on a computer screen that interprets brain waves to send Twitter messages ( tweets ) .
" We started thinking that moving a cursor on a screen is a good scientific exercise , " said Justin Williams , a University of Wisconsin - Madison assistant professor of biomedical engineering and Wilson ’s adviser .
" But when we talk to people who have locked - in syndrome or a spinal - cord injury , their number one concern is communication . "
Using the EEG - based interface , " All the letters come up , and each one of them flashes individually , " explains Williams .
" And what your brain does is –- if you ’re looking at the ‘ R ’ on the screen and all the other letters are flashing – nothing happens .
But when the ‘ R ’ flashes , your brain says , ‘ Hey , wait a minute .
Something ’s different about what I was just paying attention to . ’
And you see a momentary change in brain activity . "
Wilson was able to tweet by thought alone using EEG .
Here ’s a video showing the brain - Twitter interface :
Tweeting by thought alone is a somewhat slow process using this prototype technology –- we speak at approximately 120 words per minute .
But , as with texting , users can improve as they practice using the interface .
" I ’ve seen people do up to eight characters per minute , " Wilson says .
Brain wave applications in the laboratory –- whether using EEG or the more invasive ECoG –- now include the ability to “ mind read ” vowels , consonants , and individual letters ; algorithms to turn brain waves into musical scores ; and even twittering by thought alone .
Who needs a keyboard when you can simply think about what you want to say ( or play musically ) and have it recorded and / or communicated ?
You almost always hear it referenced as " Reagan 's 11th Commandment . "
It is a simple , one sentence warning against intra-party divisiveness that dates back two generations :
" Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican . "
The irony , of course , is that while it is almost universally attributed to Reagan , he was not its creator .
Indeed , the so - called 11th Commandment was not authored by Reagan , it was authored in order to protect Reagan .
The year was 1965 .
The Republicans had just been slaughtered in the 1964 electoral cycle , one of the most complete and total annihilations in the annals of American politics .
Not only had Lyndon Johnson been re-elected with well over 60 % of the vote , but Democrats had achieved nearly insurmountable two - thirds supermajorities in both the House and the Senate .
When the 89th Congress was gavelled into session in early 1965 , there were only 32 Republican Senators , and just 140 GOP members of the House .
Reagan was gearing up for a run for Governor of California .
His primary rival was the former mayor of San Francisco , George Christopher .
Christopher , given the fact that a former movie star would have a built - in reservoir of goodwill with voters , was going to need to go negative on Reagan in order to gain a foothold in the race .
He never got a fair chance to do so .
Before Reagan had even formally declared for the race , California Republican Chairman Gaylord Parkinson made the decree that negative attacks in the primary would not be tolerated .
Christopher went negative anyway , because , at the end of the day , he really had no choice .
But now his attacks , once standard fare in political campaigns , had the official seal of disapproval from the state party .
Reagan won the primary easily , and in a good Republican year in 1966 , scored a double - digit win over incumbent Democrat Pat Brown in the general election .
While it is often invoked as some inviolate rule of Republican campaigning , the hard truth is that the " 11th Commandment " has been oft - violated during the forty - four years since its inception .
Including , as Brian Williams pointed out in a 2007 piece for MSNBC , by Reagan himself :
In 1976 , Reagan was a former governor challenging an incumbent of his own party -- Gerald Ford -- for the Republican presidential nomination .
Ford , who made no pretense of following the 11th Commandment ( he said only that he would " abide by the first ten " ) , had beaten Reagan in the early primaries .
Reagan ’s campaign was faltering , and his own advisers urged him to take the gloves off .
He did .
Campaigning in Florida that March , Ronald Reagan broke the 11th Commandment and attacked Gerald Ford .
He accused Ford , who had then been president just 19 months , of presiding over " the collapse of American will and the retreat of American power , " and said Ford " must be held accountable to history for allowing this to happen . "
He said Ford lacked " vision , " that he found it " difficult " to trust his leadership .
He accused the president of favoring " pre-emptive concessions " in talks with the Soviet Union , and said , " I fear for my country when I see White House indifference to the decline in our military position . "
That said , neither Parkinson nor Reagan probably could have envisioned today 's GOP .
In the past several months , the Republican Party has moved internecine warfare to a new level .
The two most glaring examples were the sabotage of the party 's own nominee in New York 's 23rd Congressional District for insufficient conservatism , and the revelation this week that members of the Republican National Committee are pushing the idea of a proposed " purity test " , a ten - point agenda ( or , as Devilstower pointed out this morning , more of a promise to halt an agenda ) that Republican candidates must adhere to in order to avoid being shunned by the GOP .
This is much bigger than a mere squabble among candidates in an open seat Congressional or gubernatorial primary .
Both of these actions were , in their own ways , putting the official party imprimatur on purging unworthies from the party ranks .
So how do Republicans square these recent actions with staying true to the legacy of their patron saint ?
Conservatives would no doubt argue that they are , in fact , preserving Reagan 's Republican Party by making sure that it adheres to baseline principles that , in their view , are sacrosanct .
They want party unity , but they want it on their terms .
They are aided in this crusade by the fact that so - called moderate Republicans are so aware of their persona non grata status in the GOP that their desire to ingratiate the base knows no bounds .
In fact , two of the leading targets of the GOP purity crusade took the opportunity this week to remind Republicans that they really are , truly , one of them .
On Monday , Charlie Crist , who is increasingly imperiled in his desire to move from Governor of Florida to Senator from Florida , wanted to make it clear that he was every bit as committed to the right - wing values of the teabagger base as his insurgent opponent :
" It 's hard to be more conservative than I am on issues -- though there are different ways stylistically to communicate that .
I 'm pro-life , I 'm pro-gun , I 'm pro-family and I ''m anti tax , " the governor explained .
Meanwhile , the woman who was drummed out of the special election in upstate New York , DeDe Scozzafava , also wants people to know that in spite of her purging during the course of the battle in NY - 23 , her Republican bonafides are still largely intact :
Dede Scozzafava , the Republican candidate in NY - 23 who eventually dropped out after incurring the wrath of conservative acvists , says she would have fared pretty well on the so - called GOP " purity test . "
" I would have been at seven out of 10 on the list , " Scozzafava told CBS 's Face the Nation .
Leaving aside for the moment that 70 % would be scored as an " F " on the GOP purity test as it is currently configured , it is telling that Scozzafava still feels compelled to remind voters just how much of a Republican she really is , despite the high - profile way in which the national party turned its back on her and embraced her third - party opponent , Doug Hoffman .
This is the reason why purity test author Jim Bopp ( an RNC member from Indiana ) made clear that past votes matter little in the calculation of ideological purity .
What matters more , in his calculation , is what is done and said from this point forward .
The purity movement , in that respect , is less about igniting a civil war in the Republican Party as it is about trying to reposition the Republican Party further to the right .
In this way , it is trying to be true to Reagan ( though one with a sense of history might wonder how St. Ron would fare himself on such a purity test ) while ignoring the 11th Commandment often attributed to him .
To do so successfully , they will need the so - called centrists to capitulate to the right .
That might be a safe bet .
In October , we had Connecticut Senate candidate Rob Simmons , in an act that bordered almost on parody , proclaiming that he would be adding a teabag to his copy of the Constitution .
Earlier this month , Mark Kirk alienated longtime supporters in the abortion rights movement by voting in favor of the Stupak - Pitts amendment .
In an election year where a vast enthusiasm gap could create a perilous political environment for Democrats , these recent developments could be the saving grace for Democrats .
Indeed , it could be the salvation of the Democratic majority , no matter how it turns out .
If so - called moderate Republicans resist this rebranding of the GOP , then the dissension will clearly do harm to GOP designs on shrinking the Democratic majority .
We saw this in the New York 23rd , where a district with a sizeable GOP registration advantage turned to Democrat Bill Owens after the more moderate of the two Republicans running ( Scozzafava ) was driven from the race .
However , even if the purity movement succeeds , and the " moderate " Republicans are assimilated , that could benefit the Democrats , as well .
When the traditional media absurdly tut - tutted the challenge to Joe Lieberman in 2006 as a sign of Democratic intolerance of diverse views , they missed a key point .
At the exact same time Lieberman was getting primaried by Ned Lamont , the most conservative member of the Democratic Senate delegation was being ignored .
Ben Nelson of Nebraska did not face a primary challenge , either high - profile or low - profile .
The bottom line was simple : Nelson 's apostasy was less obscene than Lieberman's , if for no other reason than simple political geography .
Nebraska ai n't Connecticut , to put it mildly .
Republicans , in their fervor to rebrand the party , might be ignoring that lesson to their detriment .
Insisting on rigid adherence to party orthodoxy might not hurt them in some states , but it is hard to see where a Mark Kirk , a Rob Simmons , or a Mike Castle gets traction running as an advocate of teabagger Republicanism .
We have already seen some evidence of this .
In Delaware , the most recent poll from Susquehanna Research ( a firm that also does private work for GOP candidates ) found that Beau Biden now leads Republican Mike Castle in the state .
This represented an incredible shift in voter preferences : a twenty - six point shift in eight months , according to the same pollster .
No other pollster this year had given Biden the lead .
Therefore , there is a certain impracticality to this GOP purity crusade .
Conservative ideological policy sell well in certain arenas , but less so in others .
The problem for the GOP is that several of their most high - profile targets are in blue or purple territory .
That said , Democrats cannot merely rely on being saved by the possibly errant tactics of their opposition .
They could control their own electoral destiny by putting together a series of accomplishments to take to the voters in 2010 .
The clock is ticking .
Absent that , the best the Democrats could hope for is that the GOP 's purge of its unworthies and insistence on ideological unanimity might save a few Congressional seats that otherwise would have been imperiled .
MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota
Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson could lose his driver 's license after police clocked him driving at 109 mph -- nearly twice the posted speed limit -- on a suburban Minneapolis highway last weekend .
Peterson told The Associated Press on Thursday that he " got a little speeding ticket .
I need to be more aware of the speed I was going and not let it happen again . "
Peterson was pulled over just before 8:30 p.m.
Saturday while driving his BMW in a 55 - mph zone on state Highway 62 -- a normally busy stretch of road known as the Crosstown that connects Minneapolis with southern and western suburbs , Edina police spokeswoman Molly Anderson said .
She said Peterson was given a citation and allowed to drive away after what appeared to be a " very routine " traffic stop .
Anderson said police clocked the 24 - year - old Peterson going 109 mph , but Peterson told the AP he was n't driving that fast .
" But I know it was a speeding ticket , and that 's what I got issued for , " Peterson said .
The stop happened the night before Peterson ran for 85 yards and a touchdown in a 36 - 10 victory over the Chicago Bears .
The All - Pro also fumbled twice , with one of them a turnover for the Vikings .
Peterson said he was headed to the downtown hotel where the team stays the night before home games .
He said he was not late at that point .
" After I got pulled over , then I was late , " Peterson said .

New Analysis of Public Water Systems Emphasizes Need to Address Source Pollution
And it is not just the rebels being blamed .
According to human rights groups , soldiers from the Congolese Army are executing civilians , raping women and conscripting villagers to lug their food , ammunition and gear into the jungle .
It is often a death march through one of Africa ’s lushest , most stunning tropical landscapes , which has also been the scene of a devastatingly complicated war for more than a decade .
“ From a humanitarian and human rights perspective , the joint operations are disastrous , ” said Anneke Van Woudenberg , a researcher for Human Rights Watch .
The male rape cases span several hundred miles and possibly include hundreds of victims .
The American Bar Association , which runs a sexual violence legal clinic in Goma , said that more than 10 percent of its cases in June were men .
Brandi Walker , an aid worker at Panzi hospital in nearby Bukavu , said , “ Everywhere we go , people say men are getting raped , too . ”

But nobody knows the exact number .
Men here , like anywhere , are reluctant to come forward .
Several who did said they instantly became castaways in their villages , lonely , ridiculed figures , derisively referred to as “ bush wives . ”
Since being raped several weeks ago , Mr. Ziwa , 53 , has not shown much interest in practicing animal medicine , his trade for years .
He limps around ( his left leg was crushed in the attack ) in a soiled white lab coat with “ veterinaire ” printed on it in red pen , carrying a few biscuit - size pills for dogs and sheep .
NEXT STOP PURGATORY :
The controversial advertisement has upset religious groups in Britain .
An atheist campaign plans to raise $ 10,000 to run controversial slogan advertisements on New Zealand buses .
The adverts , which read " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life " , created a storm when they ran on the London Underground and British buses earlier this year .
The campaign was launched here yesterday .
New Zealand Atheist Bus Campaign spokesman Simon Fisher said it would provoke discussion on religion and take away the stigma of atheism .
" It 's okay to say you do n't believe in God , " he said .
" We like the slogan .
It works , it 's catchy , it 's not perfect , it 's a slogan , but it roughly encapsulates what we want to say . "
The campaign will be funded by donations from the public , online at http://nogod.org.nz.
Mr Fisher hopes to raise $ 10,000 to pay for six bus advertisements in Auckland , four in Wellington and two in Christchurch .
He hopes the slogans will be on buses by March 1 .
The campaign began in London with a fundraising target of £ 5500 ( NZ $ 12,350 ) ; so far it had raised more than £ 135,000 ( NZ $ 303,100 ) .
Since January more than 800 buses with the advertisements had been on the streets in Britain .
Other countries , including the United States , Canada , Italy , Spain , Australia , Finland and Germany , have run similar campaigns .
But there was a backlash from some religious groups .
People who said they were offended made complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority – but the British watchdog ruled it did not breach advertising codes .
In the 2006 census , 34.7 per cent of people said they had no religion .
NZ Bus said it outsourced its advertising on its bus fleet to an external company , i-Site .
Wayne Chapman , chief executive of i-Site , said the advertisement did not appear to breach an advertising standards code but he would reserve judgment until the firm saw a final copy .

The start of Celebration season is a festive event .
Once the first fresh hops arrive from harvest , the party begins !
We first brewed Celebration in 1981 , blazing the path for American - style IPAs and offering a new take on holiday beers , which are often spiced and sweet .
Famous for its citrus and pine aromas , Celebration is bold and intense , featuring Cascade , Centennial and Chinook hops — honoring everything we have at Sierra Nevada .

Our holiday IPA set the bar for the American style .

Heavy on hops , that was always the brewery plan .
So in 1980 , we loaded Pale Ale up with Cascade — a new hop at the time named after the mountain range — and the intense aromas of pine and citrus sparked the American craft beer revolution .

It changed tastes , made hops famous , and brought an industry back from extinction .
That ’s a hard - working beer .

The brewery count shrank from thousands to less than 100 by the late 1970s .
The beers you could find were dull , so a few thirsty rebels out West took up their own experiments in fermentation .
Among them , our founder Ken Grossman used a new US - grown hop , Cascade , to help transform stateside flavor .

The start of Celebration season is a festive event .
Once the first fresh hops arrive from harvest , the party begins !
We first brewed Celebration in 1981 , blazing the path for American - style IPAs and offering a new take on holiday beers , which are often spiced and sweet .
Famous for its citrus and pine aromas , Celebration is bold and intense , featuring Cascade , Centennial and Chinook hops — honoring everything we have at Sierra Nevada .
[ post_title ] => Celebration [ post_excerpt ] =>
Our holiday IPA set the bar for the American style .

Bigfoot is a beast of a beer , packed with bittersweet malt and heaps of aggressive whole - cone Pacific Northwest hops .
First introduced in the winter of 1983 , Bigfoot is a cult - classic brewed in the barleywine style — strong and robust with the refined intensity of a wine .
Bigfoot is prized by beer collectors for aging in cellars .
Under the proper conditions , it can develop enticing new flavors and character as it matures in the bottle .
Each new release or “ expedition ” is vintage dated .
Collect your own and savor the evolving flavors .
[ post_title ] => Bigfoot [ post_excerpt ] =>
Extreme in the ’ 80s and a force of flavor today .

Some styles of beer , though , improve with a bit of age — not unlike a fine wine .
Prime candidates include beers that are high in alcohol ( e.g. Bigfoot Barleywine ) and those with a moderate amount of roasted grains ( e.g. Narwhal Imperial Stout ) .
Over time , oxygen sneaks into bottles and changes beer flavors , adding notes of sherry or port wine and smoothing out harsh alcohol flavors .
For the best results , vintage beers should hibernate in cool , dark places .

Northern Hemisphere drops you into a hop field , the beer ’s profound flavor like strolling under the lush canopy .
This year , we picked Centennial hops at their peak , rushing the harvest into our brew kettles the very same day to make a wet hop IPA loaded with notes of citrus blossom , rose , and pine .

The start of Celebration season is a festive event .
Once the first fresh hops arrive from harvest , the party begins !
We first brewed Celebration in 1981 , blazing the path for American - style IPAs and offering a new take on holiday beers , which are often spiced and sweet .
Famous for its citrus and pine aromas , Celebration is bold and intense , featuring Cascade , Centennial and Chinook hops — honoring everything we have at Sierra Nevada .
[ post_title ] => Celebration [ post_excerpt ] =>
Our holiday IPA set the bar for the American style .

The federal government 's determination that a 400 - megawatt solar thermal power plant will not cause significant harm to a pristine strip of the Mojave Desert is a victory for those who want to place dozens of solar arrays on federal land in Southern California .
But a closer look at a federal draft environmental impact statement released last week reveals that even with extensive mitigation , the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System project would destroy rare plants and permanently alter prized views from the nearby Mojave National Preserve .
It would also annually consume an estimated 32 million gallons of groundwater in a region where water is scarce .
Such findings concern environmentalists who are almost certain to challenge the project .
They also add to mounting criticism that the Obama administration is rushing to permit utility - scale renewable energy projects without considering the projects ' effects on pristine public lands and the rare plants and animals that inhabit them .
Moreover , one of the central strategies for mitigating the project 's environmental damage -- the relocation of federally protected desert tortoises -- is projected to kill nearly one out of every six animals that are transported , according to the draft EIS document .
" It 's a good project in the wrong location , " said Ileene Anderson , a staff biologist for the Center for Biological Diversity , which has criticized a similar Mojave tortoise relocation effort involving the Army 's Fort Irwin .
The Ivanpah project is one of several renewable energy proposals being fast - tracked under a new Interior Department policy aimed at speeding the development of domestic clean energy .
The project 's developer , Oakland - based BrightSource Energy Inc. , has indicated it wants to begin construction of the massive thermal solar plant before next March , only weeks after public comment on the draft EIS is set to expire .
But Greg Suba , conservation program director with the California Native Plant Society , said the Bureau of Land Management , which jointly issued the draft EIS with the California Energy Commission , is failing to consider the proposal 's greatest shortcoming .
" The question that 's not being addressed here is basically why are they going on wild public lands first ? "
Suba said .
" Our organization and many others understand why we need renewable energy , and why large - scale utility projects will need to be part of the initial equation .
But why put these big - scale projects in the intact wildlands first ? "
As proposed , the Ivanpah project would cut through 4,073 acres of undisturbed land , " substantially affecting many sensitive plant and wildlife species and eliminating a broad expanse of relatively undisturbed Mojave Desert habitat , " the draft EIS states .
Some of the impacts would be offset by the developer 's planned purchase and preservation of 8,146 acres nearby , but such mitigation would not replace " permanently lost " habitat for tortoises and other species , BLM found .
Regulators also noted the project 's " unmitigable " impacts to the nearby Mojave National Preserve , where solar arrays " could strongly alter the character of views of Clark Mountain from the valley floor , interfering with the public 's ability to enjoy those views . "
Yet the draft EIS concludes such impacts are reasonable given the project 's " noteworthy benefits " of " reducing global carbon emissions " and helping California meet an ambitious goal of producing 33 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020 .
" No matter how we mitigate the project , the question is , ' Is the trade - off in impacts to the desert landscape , which is to be significant , worth the production of green energy from solar power ? ' " said Jan Bedrosian , a spokeswoman for BLM's California state office in Sacramento .
Fast - tracking solar
The Ivanpah project represents the latest in a string of emerging conflicts between environmentalists and federal regulators working to meet an Obama administration mandate to aggressively expand renewable energy resources to replace carbon - emitting fossil fuels such as oil , gas and coal .
And perhaps nowhere are the stakes higher than in the Mojave Desert , a landscape many environmentalists believe will soon be under siege from renewable energy developers attracted by the desert 's unparalleled solar intensity .
" For us this is a difficult issue because we support renewable energy , " said Joshua Basofin , California representative for Defenders of Wildlife in Sacramento .
" The difficulty for us is how do we guide these projects to be more environmentally sustainable and minimize impacts to wildlife habitat ? "
A total of 126 renewable energy project applications covering 1 million acres are under review by BLM officials for the California portion of the Mojave , according to agency statistics .
Those include 63 solar power plant projects that , if built , would cover 567,974 acres .
At the same time , 351,000 acres of Mojave Desert has been designated by the Interior Department as a solar study zone , meaning it could gain even more federal backing as a site for commercial - scale solar development .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has said he wants to have at least 13 major solar projects under construction by next year , when the solar study zone areas are finalized .
And last week Interior officials announced they would fast - track five new renewable energy projects in California -- four solar plants and one wind farm -- with hopes of making the projects eligible for grants under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
But first up is the Ivanpah project , located about 25 miles southwest of Las Vegas .
BrightSource Energy has applied for federal stimulus money grants for the project and also is racing to get the permits in hand by the end of 2010 .
Keely Wachs , a company spokeswoman , said in a statement that when completed , the Ivanpah complex " will exceed all of the rooftop solar energy installed in 2008 in the United States and more than double the nation 's total solar thermal energy capacity . "
Moving desert tortoises
One of the central challenges identified in the draft EIS is the relocation of at least 25 desert tortoises currently occupying the development site to another location , preferably to the west of the proposed project .
Once those relocations have occurred , deed restrictions would need to be adopted that keep the tortoise - occupied land off - limits " in perpetuity . "
But relocating tortoises poses inherent dangers to the animals .
The biggest problem , experts say , is that the tortoises instinctively try to return to their original burrows .
And once in unfamiliar territory , they become easy targets for coyotes , ravens and other predators .
That is what happened last year when the Army moved 600 tortoises from their desert habitat to BLM land to make room for expanded training operations at Fort Irwin , about 50 miles north of Barstow , Calif .
Roughly 90 transported tortoises died , primarily from coyote predation , prompting the Army and BLM to temporarily suspend the $ 8.7 million translocation program ( Land Letter , Aug. 13 ) .
" The track record for desert tortoise relocation is definitely suboptimal , " said Anderson , the Center for Biological Diversity biologist .
Anderson said BLM should hold off on relocating additional tortoises until they can provide greater certainty that the animals will survive .
But BLM and the California Energy Commission already project that some will not survive the relocation , according to the draft EIS .
" Mortality for translocated desert tortoise has been estimated at approximately 15 percent , " according to the draft EIS .
Basofin , the Defenders of Wildlife representative , said he is bewildered that regulators would approve a mitigation strategy that results in the death of federally protected tortoises .
" It 's enough to make your head explode , " he said .
Bedrosian , the BLM spokeswoman , said the agency would look closely at the Fort Irwin relocation problems and make necessary adjustments to the mitigation plan for the Ivanpah site .
" Certainly that 's going to be looked at because we want to make sure the tortoise transfer is successful , " Bedrosian said .
An overlooked landscape
To some , the fact that energy firms have put a bull 's - eye on the Mojave Desert reflects a kind of ignorance about desert ecosystems .
While public perception may hold that desert landscapes are barren , advocates say such notions are false .
" It 's a diverse area .
It 's full of life , " Suba said .
" But there are those who tend to marginalize and be dismissive of the desert as a valuable ecosystem . "
Many of those biases are reflected throughout the draft EIS document , critics say .
For example , significant areas will be graded or cleared of vegetation to make way for roads , buildings and solar arrays .
That , according to the draft EIS , will destroy habitat for rare plants like the Rusby 's desert - mallow , which is classified by BLM as a " sensitive species , " as well as the Mojave milkweed , which is found in the Ivanpah Valley project area and has been classified by California as vulnerable to extinction " due to extreme rarity . "
Another species expected to be affected by the project is the desert pincushion of which 25 are known to exist in California and " approximately one - third of which occur in the project area . "
The draft EIS acknowledges that effects to the Mojave milkweed and Rusby 's desert - mallow cannot be sufficiently mitigated .
Instead , the state and BLM want BrightSource Energy to conduct surveys for both plants on the more than 8,100 acres it will be required to purchase for the mitigation , as well as any land it purchases to relocate the desert tortoise .
" This requirement does not serve to reduce the impacts of the ... project to less - than - significant levels , " according to the draft EIS , " but provides information that might help inform future siting to avoid additional impacts from other development . "

Origami master Sipho Mabona and the art of creating a paper praying mantis
These are the incredible folded fauna and intricate insects made from paper that look just like the real thing .
The amazing paper pieces of art - each from a single sheet of paper - are the work of 29 - year - old origami expert Sipho Mabona .
He started making paper planes when he was just five - years - old but his passion for paper meant he ran out of designs for the planes by the time he was 15 .
The artist then turned his eye to other inspirations for his next artwork taking tips from nature and the environment .
At first glance it looks like a praying mantis .
However closer exmination reveals it to be a work of origami and only the leaf and stem are real
Koi blimey !
A large version of the fish prepares to take a dive into the water
Origami expert Sipho Mabona started making paper planes when he was just five years old but his passion for paper meant he ran out of designs for the planes by the time he was 15 .
He then began to take inspiration from nature as this stunning stag beetle shows
His amazing insects , birds and folded fish are so detailed they are almost capable of fooling the naked eye into thinking they are real .
His incredibly intricate designs sell for more than £ 1,500 and are exhibited in galleries in Japan , Switzerland , Canada , Spain and France .
And he is now set to bring his art to the UK next year .
Each piece can take up to 20 hours to fold and take more than six months to design .
Sipho was the first - ever foreigner to be invited to the Japan Origami Academic Society ( JOAS ) Convention in 2008 and his work graced the cover of the official magazine .
Clever creations : A grasshopper and , right , a tiger are further examples of Sipho 's art
A shoal of koi carp .
A single piece of art from him can sell for up to £ 1,500
He said : ' I started folding paper planes as a child and then went on to do origami ten years ago .
' The inspiration for me can be anything , from insects like the praying mantis , to fish , birds , the weather and the landscape .
' The time it takes to make each piece differs from figure to figure .
' The quickest would probably be a Koi carp , but even that takes me around one hour to fold .
' On the other hand for things like the praying mantis I took 20 hours of solid folding .
' But designing the models is what takes quite some time usually .
That can be anywhere from a day to six months of off and on work .
' I sell my work for prices for a single piece range anywhere from 300 to 2,500 swiss francs , or £ 1,500 .
' All representational models are made from one single uncut square of paper .
Some abstract models are folded from one uncut rectangle .'
Sipho , whose mother is Swiss and his father South African , was born and raised in Switzerland .

Doug Holtz - Eakin , the former top health - care - reform advisor to John McCain during the presidential election is in an ironic position .
After the election his job vanished , of course , and now his COBRA health coverage — for which he pays around $ 1000 a month — is about to expire .
And an accident in 1990 left him with a damaged kidney , which means he has one of those pesky “ preexisting conditions ” .
He jokes “ My mother is deeply concerned that I do n’t have a job . ”
Of course , he does n’t have to worry too much .
Holtz - Eakin himself says “ Let ’s not whine too much about me .
I ’m a wealthy , affluent American in the big picture . ”
But an increasing number of Americans are finding themselves in similar situations , and they are n’t so well off .
Is his experience giving him any empathy for those less fortunate ?
Unfortunately , no .
Holtz - Eakin says his conviction on the hot - button issue of health care is unchanged .
Sigh .
CLEVELAND , Ohio —
A federal appeals court ruled last week that the family of 15 - year - old Brandon McCloud , whom Cleveland police detectives fatally shot in 2005 , cannot sue the city or the officers for his death .
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asserted that the detectives , Philip Habeeb and John Kraynik , acted reasonably and believed the teenager posed a threat when they shot him 10 times while searching his home for evidence related to the armed robbery of a pizza delivery man .
The court ruled that the detectives and the city qualify for immunity under a statute that protects municipalities from civil prosecution and ordered U.S. District Judge Kate O'Malley to reverse her earlier ruling denying the detectives ' motion for dismissal .
McCloud 's family sued the detectives in 2006 , saying that their reckless behavior and use of excessive force caused the teenager 's death .
In asking O'Malley to dismiss the suit , Habeeb and Kraynik said they confronted a suspect who moved out of a closet suddenly in a small , dark bedroom with a knife in hand .
They said McCloud , just seven feet away , presented a serious threat to their safety .
But O'Malley said in a 54 - page ruling last year that McCloud was not charging the officers , since a mattress separated him from them , and that he was n't waving the knife he held in his right hand in a threatening manner .
The judge held that there was enough evidence that a jury could find the detectives used excessive force .
The appellate court rejected O'Malley 's logic Friday , calling it " exactly the sort of theoretical speculation that the courts are prohibited from engaging in . "
A spokesman for Google said : " While the vast majority of this information is correct there are occasional errors .
We 're constantly working to improve the quality and accuracy of the information available in Google Maps and appreciate our users ' feedback in helping us do so .

Fortitude Valley venues have slammed calls for Brisbane 's entertainment precincts to be shut down at 2 am , saying the proposal signals a return to the Joh Bjelke - Petersen era .
Queensland Police Union ( QPU ) today called for the Valley entertainment district and parts of the CBD to be closed at 2 am in a bid to curb the number of violent late - night street bashings .
Under the union 's submission to the State Government inquiry committee on alcohol - related violence suburban venues would be subject to a midnight shut down .
The union claims the shutdown would reduce the strain on emergency services forced to tolerate regular violent assaults from intoxicated club - goers , while quashing alcohol - related violence on the streets .
Lord Mayor Campbell Newman threw his weight behind the QPU proposal , saying he was " desperate " to see a dramatic reduction in alcohol - related violence .

It may look like a piece of virtuoso knitting , but the makers of an image they call the Mandelbulb ( see right ) claim it is most accurate three - dimensional representation to date of the most famous fractal equation : the Mandelbrot set .
Fractal figures are generated by an “ iterative ” procedure : you apply an equation to a number , apply the same equation to the result and repeat that process over and over again .
When the results are translated into a geometric shape , they can produce striking “ self - similar ” images , forms that contain the same shapes at different scales ; for instance , some look uncannily like a snowflake .
The tricky part is finding an equation that produces an interesting image .

The most famous fractal equation is the 2D Mandelbrot set , named after the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot of Yale University , who coined the name “ fractals ” for the resulting shapes in 1975 .
But there are many other types of fractal , both in two and three dimensions .
The “ Menger sponge ” is one of the simplest 3D examples .
Fake fractal
There have been previous attempts at a 3D Mandelbrot image , but they do not display real fractal behaviour , says Daniel White , an amateur fractal image maker based in Bedford , UK .
Spinning the 2D Mandelbrot fractal like wood on a lathe , raising and lowering certain points , or invoking higher - dimensional mathematics can all produce apparently three - dimensional Mandelbrots .
Yet none of these techniques offer the detail and self - similar shapes that White believes represent a true 3D fractal image .
Two years ago , he decided to find a “ true ” 3D version of the Mandelbrot .
The next dimension
“ I was trying to see how the original 2D Mandelbrot worked and translate that to the third dimension , ” he explains .
“ You can use complex maths but you can also look at things geometrically . ”
This approach works thanks to the properties of the “ complex plane ” , a mathematical landscape where ordinary numbers run from “ east ” to “ west ” , while “ imaginary ” numbers , based on the square root of - 1 , run from “ south ” to “ north ” .
Multiplying numbers on the complex plane is the same as rotating it , and addition is like shifting the plane in a particular direction .
To create the Mandelbrot set , you just repeat these geometrical actions for every point in the plane .
Some will balloon to infinity , escaping the set entirely , while others shrink down to zero .
The different colours on a typical image reflect the number of iterations before each point hits zero .
White wondered if performing these same rotations and shifts in a 3D space would capture the essence of the Mandelbrot set without using complex numbers – real numbers plus imaginary numbers – which do not apply in three dimensions because they are on only two axes .
In November 2007 , White published a formula for a shape that came pretty close .
Higher power
The formula published by White gave good results , but still lacked true fractal detail .
Collaborating with the members of Fractal Forums , a website for fractal admirers , he continued his search .
It was another member , Paul Nylander , who eventually realised that raising White ’s formula to a higher power – equivalent to increasing the number of rotations – would produce what they were looking for .
White ’s search is n’t over , though .
He admits the Mandelbulb is not quite the “ real ” 3D Mandelbrot .
“ There are still ‘ whipped cream ’ sections , where there is n’t detail , ” he explains .
“ If the real thing does exist – and I ’m not saying 100 per cent that it does – one would expect even more variety than we are currently seeing . ”
Part of the problem is that extending the Mandelbrot set to 3D requires many subjective choices that influence the outcome .
For example , you could extend a flat plane to 3D by stretching it to form a box , but you could also turn it into a sphere .
“ It ’s an interesting academic exercise to think what you should get , ” says Martin Turner , a computer scientist specialising in fractal images at the University of Manchester , UK , “ but it all depends on what properties you want to keep in the third dimension . ”
The equations
White used may get the job done , but the system of algebra used is not applicable to all 3D mathematics .
“ The next stage is mathematical rigour , ” says Turner .

In the wake of an AP report on Wednesday that President Barack Obama is not satisfied with any of the options on Afghanistan he has received from his national security team and is demanding revisions , MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow turned to veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh for insight .
“ It could be huge , ” Hersh told Maddow , “ simply that the president ’s finally saying , ‘ I ’m taking control . ' ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The one thing that mystified a lot of people , ” Hersh explained , “ was the decision to let General McChrystal write a report .
There ’s no general in history that will come back , given that assignment , and say ‘ We ca n’t win . ' ”
“ This is basically a war , at best , that ’s going to be a stalemate , ” continued Hersh .
“ And so Obama is just putting his foot down , and that ’s great . …
He ’s grabbing it and he has n’t been grabbing it until now . ”
Hersh also commented on a New York Times story which revealed that the US Ambassador to Afghanistan , former Lieutenant General Karl Eikenberry , had cabled Washington last week to express “ his reservations about deploying additional troops to the country , ” thereby putting himself “ in stark opposition to the current American and NATO commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , who has asked for 40,000 more troops . ”
Hersh described Eikenberry ’s cable as “ big news , ” especially because Eikenberry has been one of a group of generals — which also includes McChrystal , Petraeus , and Odierno — who graduated from West Point around 1973 - 75 and have stuck together over the years as what is seen by other military leaders as a “ West Point Mafia . ”
According to Hersh , this has caused “ a lot of trauma within the Army , which is very resentful . …
The top of the Army … they ’ve been very unhappy with the McChrystal appointment and the way things have been going . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
That is why Hersh sees it as significant that Eikenberry is now steering an independent course .
“ This summer inside the embassy , ” he told Maddow , “ there was a lot of concerns about the stability — literally the mental stability — of Karzai .
And I think Eikenberry probably knows more than most people . ”
“ Eikenberry is simply , I think , reflecting a huge split , ” Hersh concluded , “ because he ’s now splitting from the McChrystal counter - insurgency wing that ’s been dominated by Petraeus . ”
Hersh called his conclusion about Eikenberry a “ heuristic guess , ” but it is supported by one online analysis which tracks Eikenberry ’s statements since 2007 and suggests that “ General McChrystal is on a special mission based a specific philosophy of warfare and that General Eikenberry is performing his duty according to his current assignment with an ongoing evaluation of the various players and facts at hand . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ General Eikenberry is both a soldier and scholar of history and political science , ” this analysis concludes .
“ He knows the history of occupations that fail to deliver for the populace and he ’s telling us right now that the U.S. ca n’t succeed with more military forces in a nation run by an illegitimate president who has been exposed for election fraud .
More troops are not the solution . ”

JAKARTA , Indonesia —
Nothing has changed .
Indonesians still see money in their trees .
But where once they saw money in destroying them , they are now beginning to see money in saving them .
Indonesia , in fact , has for the last three years been leading the push for the passage of a plan called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation , known as REDD , by the United Nations Climate Change Council .
And now , the once fairy - tale scheme could be the lone concrete accomplishment to come out of the ongoing climate change talks in Copenhagen .
Though its implementation is fraught with complications , the idea is simple : Reward developing countries with carbon credits , potentially worth billions of dollars , for sustaining their forests .
Indonesia ’s enthusiasm is not noble .
The government sees the scheme as a potential windfall , as well as a way for it to crawl out from beneath its reputation as one of the world ’s worst polluters — an important goal as it positions itself , for the first time in its history , on the world stage .
To this end , President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono announced earlier this year that his administration would work toward cutting emissions by at least 26 percent by 2020 .
Curbing emissions from deforestation would be an essential part of that goal .
“ We do n’t want to sacrifice the welfare of our people , ” said Rachmat Witoeler , a former environment minister and Indonesia ’s lead negotiator in Copenhagen .
“ But we can make serious efforts to cut down on those factors that cause carbon emissions . ”
The destruction of forests is now believed to account for one - fifth of the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions .
Forty percent of that , according to a 2007 World Bank report , comes from the clearing of Indonesia ’s forests , together with the draining and burning of its peat lands , which contain vast stores of carbon .
This destruction is only accelerating as the global demand for palm oil , which is used in cooking and cosmetics and , lately , in a popular biodiesel , increases .
Palm oil was once thought to be a sustainable alternative , but the process of clearing land for palm plantations has had the reverse effect .
In Riau , a province in Sumatra that is about the size of Switzerland , the situation is particularly dire .
Vast expanses of land have been reduced to smoldering ruins , twisted stumps the only sign of what once was .
Villagers there regularly clash with pulp and paper giants that are cutting an ever - expanding swath to make way for plantations with little to no oversight .
In the past 10 years , according to Jikalahari , a local environmental group in Riau , 60 percent of the province ’s forests have been logged , burned and pulped .
This , the World Bank says , makes Indonesia the world ’s third - largest emitter , behind the United States and China .
Although the Indonesian government rejects that label , it admits that a large part of reaching its planned emission cuts will need to be through curbing deforestation .
Enter REDD .
“ REDD is very important to Indonesia ’s long - term environment plan , ” said Frances Seymour , director general of the Center for International Forestry Research .
“ The president ’s recently announced commitment to cut carbon emissions cannot be reached without reductions in emissions from deforestation and degradation . ”
Over the last several years , Indonesia has become one of the world ’s “ hot spots ” for REDD demonstration projects and has emerged as a driving force behind the plan .
Indonesia hosted the United Nations Climate Conference in Bali in 2007 , which produced the Bali Action Plan .
It convened the “ F11 ” group of forested countries and it has been one of the first countries to develop regulations to govern REDD .
But as full implementation creeps forward , so does a bevy of obstacles .
Governing REDD will require unprecedented levels of inter-governmental collaboration .
Many of the key drivers of deforestation come from outside the forestry sector , such as the ministries of mining , industry and transportation .
But such collaboration is virtually nonexistent in the current Indonesian government .
Meanwhile , ownership and control of significant areas of Indonesia ’s forests are contested between government agencies , private companies and local communities .
All these conflicts , many of them dating back decades , would need to be resolved before the rightful stewards of forest areas can be compensated by REDD schemes .
Perhaps most daunting for Indonesia are problems of legality and corruption .
For REDD to be successful , Indonesia will have to institute effective controls on forest crime and develop ways to ensure REDD revenue remains transparent and accountable .
And indigenous groups worry that for them it will be the same old story .
Powerful interests would position themselves as the legitimate stewards of the land in order to capture REDD revenue streams , causing indigenous groups to lose access to their forest - based livelihoods .
Still , Indonesia remains optimistic that REDD is the answer to that old stumbling block : “ Why should we sacrifice our own development and economy to save an environment destroyed by the already developed world ? ”
“ Many efforts to address deforestation in Indonesia over the last few decades have not shown significant results , ” Seymour , whose global operations are based near Jakarta , said .
“ Currently , government policies that drive forest conversion are justified on the basis of their potential to promote development .
If REDD can provide an alternative source of income that can compete with the revenues available from other land uses , it could provide a rationale for change . ”
In a sense , Seymour said , REDD could be a mechanism for correcting the market failures that led to the over - exploitation of forests to begin with .
The markets have never valued the ecosystem services provided by forests .
REDD could change that , forcing the market on the side of the forests and ultimately on the side of eliminating climate change .
Bruce Sheiman recently published a book descriptively entitled " An Atheist Defends Religion : Why Humanity Is Better Off With Religion Than Without It " .
A blog written by a self - professed fence - sitting agnostic gave it a positive reivew and provided a lot of nice HL Mencken quotes .
Bruce Sheiman issued this poorly considered response : What do you think of that ?
Has anyone read Bruce 's book ?
My response to Bruce Sheiman is in the comments below .
Scoring and shooting are historically at their lowest in the first month of the NBA season and then steadily climb .
But that 's not the way this season has started .
To greet the new type of rims rolled in by the league last month , league - wide scoring has risen by nearly five points through the first seven days of the regular season compared to last season .
Teams are averaging a hearty 99.96 points per game , up from 95.17 during the same span in 2008 - 09 .
So what gives ?
Conclusions are difficult to draw just a week into a regular season that spans some six months , but teams are undeniably taking more 3 - pointers with each passing year .
A few new teams every season tend to decide they want to play at a faster pace and the general trend throughout the league finds coaches working 3s into their offenses and practice routines more than ever .
Atlanta , Houston , Memphis and Milwaukee are prime examples of teams that have upped the tempo of their offenses this season to contribute to the scoring increase , while Phoenix and Philadelphia -- teams that eventually ran freely in 2008 - 09 -- started last season at a much more measured pace .
Less clear , though , is what sort of impact on leaguewide scoring , if any , can be traced to the new -- and some say more forgiving -- rims ushered in at the start of exhibition play in early October .
The league switched rim manufactures for the 2009 - 10 season , introducing a new Spalding basket system that includes the " Arena Pro 180 Goal " rim , which breaks away at both the front and sides .
Previous collapsible rims used in the NBA broke away only from the front .
" I would liken these new rims to the ones found on the playgrounds that we grew up on , " Houston Rockets forward Shane Battier said .
" If you miss on the back iron , it deadens the rebound .
If you miss on the front rim , it gives the rebound spring and your chances of rolling the ball in are better . "
Some shooters , in other words , are finding that the new rims deliver softer bounces that could lead to more baskets .
Yet league officials are adamant that the most significant change to the NBA 's rims since the 1981 introduction of breakaway rims was made purely for safety reasons -- just as in ' 81 -- as opposed to any potential scoring benefit .
Rims with more give on the sides , they say , are beneficial for players when they drive to the basket .
Spalding 's rims also feature a " tube - tie net system " designed to prevent players ' fingers from getting caught in the hooks used on old rims as well as new padding at the base of the rim to help limit scrapes and bruises from the rim .
NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Wednesday that the size , material and tension ( elasticity ) of the rims has not changed from last season .
" We upgraded to the 180 - degree breakaway rim to improve safety and reduce the risk of players injuring or straining their bodies , hands , wrists or fingers , " Frank said .
" We 're always looking for products that are safer without tangibly changing the game . "
Seven days ' worth of games last season is considered to be a small sample by statistics experts , but the jump from 95.17 points per game to the current 99.96 comes at at a time when offenses are traditionally still getting in sync .
( CNN ) -- Fountains of red - hot lava shot up from the intensifying Mayon volcano as the Philippines awaited an imminent eruption , the country 's national news agency reported Tuesday .
Tens of thousands of people have already fled their homes .
More than 9,000 families -- a total of 44,394 people -- are being housed in evacuation camps after authorities raised the alert status of the country 's most active volcano , Albay Province Gov. Joey Salceda said .
The Philippine Institute on Volcanology and Seismology was considering ratcheting up the volcano alert to the highest level , which would mean an eruption was underway , the Philippine News Agency ( PNA ) reported .
But officials said not everyone is heeding their warnings -- some villagers were spotted within the danger zone checking on their homes and farms on the foothills of the volcano .
The government is trying to enforce a " no man 's land " rule in the designated danger zone , with military and police instructed to double the personnel manning the nine checkpoints and double their foot patrol operation inside the restricted area , PNA reported .
" Mayon continued to show an intense level of activity during the past 24 - hour observation period .
Seismic activity remained elevated in number and size as the seismic network detected a total of 1,266 volcanic earthquakes , " it said in a statement about the last 24 hours to 7 a.m. local time on Tuesday ( 6 p.m. ET on Monday ) .
People in surrounding Albay Province have flocked to town centers to catch a glimpse of glowing lava cascading down the slopes of Mayon since the mountain began oozing fiery lava and belching clouds of ash last week .
i Report : Are you there ?
Share photos , video
The volcano , located about 500 km ( 310 miles ) south of the Philippine capital of Manila , has erupted 49 times since its first documented eruption in 1616 .
The Philippines is situated in the so - called Ring of Fire , an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions .
Mayon 's most violent eruption , in 1814 , killed more than 1,200 people and devastated several towns .
Its last major eruption was in 1993 .
Since then , it has remained restless , emitting ash and spewing lava .
ClimateGate : The Very Ugly Side of Climate Science
When we think about “ scientists , ” most of us probably envision people toiling away in the lab or the field , accumulating and analyzing data in order to test theories , leaving their personal biases at home , scrupulously considering any confounding data or theories and willfully distancing themselves from the political implications of their research .
How quaint .
Truth be told , scientific research has been a blood sport for centuries .
But a recent scandal that ’s been dubbed ClimateGate is showing a very ugly side of climate science , and anyone who clung to that old - fashioned vision of scientists at work will be surprised by the reality .
There is much to be written and said on this topic , and a lot of what ’s being said at this early date is hyperbolic , on both sides of the aisle .
Here ’s a good summary from Andrew Revkin at The Times :
Hundreds of private e-mail messages and documents hacked from a computer server at a British university are causing a stir among global warming skeptics , who say they show that climate scientists conspired to overstate the case for a human influence on climate change .
The e-mail messages , attributed to prominent American and British climate researchers , include discussions of scientific data and whether it should be released , exchanges about how best to combat the arguments of skeptics , and casual comments — in some cases derisive — about specific people known for their skeptical views . …
In one e-mail exchange , a scientist writes of using a statistical “ trick ” in a chart illustrating a recent sharp warming trend .
In another , a scientist refers to climate skeptics as “ idiots . ”
Some skeptics asserted Friday that the correspondence revealed an effort to withhold scientific information .
“ This is not a smoking gun ; this is a mushroom cloud , ” said Patrick J. Michaels , a climatologist who has long faulted evidence pointing to human - driven warming and is criticized in the documents . …
The evidence pointing to a growing human contribution to global warming is so widely accepted that the hacked material is unlikely to erode the overall argument .
However , the documents will undoubtedly raise questions about the quality of research on some specific questions and the actions of some scientists .
If you are a fan of science , this is a pretty grim day .
If you are a fierce partisan on either side of the global - warming issue , you are either gnashing your teeth or clicking your heels .
If you are a government official heading to Copenhagen soon for the climate summit , you are probably wondering what the hell you ’re supposed to think now .
If you are a reader of the Freakonomics blog , you are probably … well , I do n’t know : tell us what you ’re thinking .
A Colombian hitman recently disclosed to the Venezuelan government that over 2,500 paramilitary fighters are in the country , each chasing a $ 25 million bounty on the life of Venezuela President Hugo Chavez , according to Arab news network Al Jazeera .
The man , who is reportedly in the custody of Venezuelan officials , said the bounty was offered by Manuel Rosales , Chavez ’s most prominent political foe , during a secret meeting 10 years ago .

Rosales allegedly said “ that he would give $ 25 million to kill [ Chavez ] , but that he himself would not give the money directly , ” the man said , as translated by Al Jazeera .
Rosales fled into Peru in April after a warrant was issued for his arrest .
He protested in the media , calling the corruption charges a political lynching .
“ Right now , there are two thousand , five hundred paramilitaries from Colombia inside Venezuela with one objective : with the objective of taking down Chavez , with the objective of destabilizing him ” a translator says on the video .
The network was unable to obtain comment from Rosales , and the Venezuela attorney general ’s office would not confirm nor deny the veracity of the man ’s claims .
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter , speaking to a South American newspaper recently , claimed the United States may have been involved in an attempted overthrow of Chavez ’s regime .

“ I think there is no doubt that in 2002 , the United States had at the very least full knowledge about the coup , and could even have been directly involved , ” he told El Tiempo last week .
Carter told El Tiempo that he believed Chavez was elected in a “ fair ” vote in 1999 , had carried out necessary reforms for Venezuela and ensured that “ those who are traditionally excluded are able to get a larger share of the national wealth . ”
But he also said he was worried by the Venezuelan leader ’s drift towards “ authoritarianism . ”

In August , Colombian officials announced a deal with the United States that will allow U.S. troops to be stationed at Colombian military bases , which will serve as a hub for remote surveillance in the region .
Their mission will allegedly use advanced Predator drone technology to aid in fighting the drug trade and to combat terrorism , according to published reports in August .
In Venezuela , officials bristled at the news .
Chavez warned : “ The winds of war [ are ] beginning to blow . ”

Here we present a graphical representations of the world ’s 20 biggest CO2 emitters , in terms of million metric tonnes .
China has now overtaken the United States as the world ’s biggest polluter ; its carbon emissions have more than doubled in a decade .
However , US and China , world ’s biggest polluters , promise to address global climate change at the Climate Change Summit at the UN General Assembly in New York , recently .
India , now the fourth biggest polluter , is also rapidly increasing its emissions , and is increasing its population of 1.15 billion people far faster than any other country ; soon its human numbers will be on a par with China ’s and its emissions following suit .
Australia worst for per capita energy consumption
Australia has overtaken the USA and is now classified most at risk out of 185 countries , according to the CO2 Energy Emissions Index ( CEEI ) , released by UK based , global risks analyst , Maplecroft .
Australians now emit 20.58 tons of CO2 per person annually , whereas American ’s emit 19.78 tons , almost a 4 % difference .
Canada meanwhile emits 18.81 tons per person .
In sharp contrast the emerging markets of China and India , considered two of the world ’s worst overall CO2 polluters , annually emit 4.5 and 1.16 tons per person respectively .

– EVENT REPORT –
Where ’s the EPA Going with Airliners and Automobiles ?
In decisive and well publicized move to strengthen the U.S. position on Global Warming , just in time for the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen , the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) threatens to upstage the U.S. Congress by stepping in ( with a compliant Department of Transport ) to begin placing regulations of it ’s own on Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions in America .
This event has also allowed Barack Obama to maintain his political poise and environmental commitments when assuring the World that the United States is indeed prepared to take clear and decisive actions against Global Warming .
The significant risk in establishing this alternate legal route to the regulation of Greenhouse Gases ( GhG’s ) via the EPA , rather than waiting for any similar Bills to finally clear Congress , means that a political gauntlet has been tossed down that could either spur U.S. lawmakers to regain their role in this fight , or possibly generate a severe backlash from those who see this as an affront to their authority and who can also control the EPA ’s funding and functions , depending upon who picks up this tossed challenge and rises to the occasion .
This bold opening move is based in a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling ( from a deeply divided decision ) that the Clean Air Act granted EPA the authority to regulate automobile emissions , and furthermore that GhG ’s could fit within the Clean Air Act definition of air pollutants according to subsequent EPA reports .
At the risk of sideswiping industrialists and lawmakers throughout the land , on December 7/09 , The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) came forward to issue its formal findings that greenhouse gasses ( GhG’s ) , including carbon dioxide emissions , do indeed “ threaten the public health and welfare of the American people ” .
This statement effectively sets the stage for the EPA to regulate a list of GhG under provisions of the 1970 Clean Air Act , and CO2 is now at the top of that confirmed list .
Under the provisions of the 1970 Clean Air Act , EPA is obligated to address declared pollutants .
Jackson explained that the “ premise ” of the Act is that “ once you know you have a pollutant and you know it ’s endangering public welfare , then EPA must act . ”
The question remains what is teh EPa ’s next move ?
Americans are now poised to at least expect regulations for “ light - duty ” vehicles ( for now ) since the EPA has only officially cited these among all on - road vehicles as contributors ( 23 % ) of total GhG emissions .
Obviously the EPA is n’t willing to tread on too many toes ( yet ) by citing heavy duty or commercial transport vehicles during this opening volley .
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson demonstrated additional restraint in acknowledging that top - down regulations would be more costly than a cap and trade system , saying , “ Legislation is so important because it will combine the most efficient , most economy - wide , least costly , least disruptive way to deal with carbon dioxide pollution , ” she recently stated , adding that “ we get further faster without top - down regulation . ”
Meanwhile the Airline Industry is barely exhaling any CO2 at all as it holds it ’s breathe , and waits for the first cards to be dealt in this new round in the political battle against GhG ’s in America .
A spokesperson told ATWOnline , “ If the EPA decides it wants to regulate GHGs from aircraft , it must first make the type of findings that it just made for automobiles , ” .
The EPA for its part , has already clearly established a premise for citing additional contributors to GhG’s .
This has Airlines and Automobile manufacturers , and any other major suppliers of the Transportation sector , very concerned about where things are moving to in the future .
Even if the U.S. Congress is unable to pass its contentious “ Cap - and - Trade ” climate change legislation , the House of Representatives has already passed a climate bill in June ’09 , and now the Senate is considering its own version of such actions .
The Air Transport Association ( ATA ) has already spoken up and has warned that both versions of such Bills could impose billions of dollars in additional ANNUAL costs upon an already heavily taxed airline industry .
An ATA spokesperson is paraphrased as saying , “ Commercial airlines contribute only about 2 % of the US Greenhouse Gas ( GhG ) inventory . . . It ’s not clear that the EPA ’s findings which state that automobiles ’ cause or contribute ’ to endangerment would necessarily also mean that the EPA would make such a finding for aviation as well ” .
It ’s hard for the layperson to imagine GHG ’s being something you can measure in an “ inventory “ , however it ’s clear that the EPA is counting on playing a numbers game ( at least for awhile ) to avoid getting into any legal messes , or locking horns with Congress as it continues to seek stringent regulation of at least CO2 emissions … if not any of the other GhG ’s on it ’s list .
President Obama and EPA Administrator Lisa P.Jackson have publicly stated that they support a legislative solution to the problem of climate change and Congress ’ efforts to pass comprehensive climate legislation .
However , climate change is threatening public health and welfare , and it is critical that EPA fulfill its obligation to respond to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that determined that greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act definition of air pollutants .
It ’s entirely unclear when or how the EPA will start enacting regulations based on their findings , but act they must if they are to support the position that they ’ve provided Obama in time for Copenhagen , otherwise they risk losing even more credibility for the U.S. than it had to begin with .

THE ASUS EEE KEYBOARD might be the most desirable computer in a keyboard design , but it ’s unlikely to be cheap once it launches considering all the little tweaks Asus had done to it since it was announced .
Enter the NorhTec Gecko Surfboard , the $ 99 PC in a keyboard that runs Linux on a 1GHz x86 SoC .
If you found the Eee Keyboard to be way too powerful for your needs , then look no further as the Gecko Surfboard wo n’t break any performance records .
Okay , so that was a bit mean , but the Vortex86MX CPU core found in the Xcore86 SoC that NorhTec relies on for just about all its products is n’t exactly cutting edge , although it ’s very power frugal .
The entire Gecko Surfboard draws a mere 5W according to early details , although this seems almost too good to be true .
This does of course not include the screen , but it makes you wonder what the big chip guys are up when a little company like NorhTec can come up with a solution that uses this little power .
Feature wise the Gecko Surfboard has a couple of interesting points worth noting .
First it has two SDHC card slots of which one can be used to boot the OS .
The basic $ 99 version does n’t come with a hard drive , but there ’s space internally for a 2.5 - inch IDE unit .
The Gecko Surfboard does n’t require a computer screen , although it does have a D - sub connector , but it can also be connected to a TV using a composite vide connector .
It also comes with a pair of USB 2.0 ports , a serial port , 10 / 100 M bit Ethernet and two audio jacks for headphones and a mic .
Optional extras include an 802.11b/g
WiFi module and surprisingly a 3G data module .
Apart from the relatively slow CPU the major downside of the Gecko Surfboard is that it only comes with 512MB of DDR2 RAM and this is n’t user upgradable .
The reason for this is that the memory is soldered onto the plug - in module that the CPU is fitted to .
However , NorhTec is promising an updated version with 1GB which should help improve overall performance .
The Gecko Surfboard is targeting the developing markets and it ’s meant to be a cost efficient , power frugal , easy to use system and in all fairness is seems like NorhTec has hit those targets .
The company will also offer it with Windows XP for $ 150 , but we ca n’t see a lot of potential customers going down this route .
The Gecko Surfboard is half the price of NorhTec ’s EduBook which was announced earlier this year and the two are based on the same hardware and are targeting a similar audience .

Attempts have been made to break into the offices of one of Canada 's leading climate scientists , it was revealed yesterday .
The victim was Andrew Weaver , a University of Victoria scientist and a key contributor to the work of the Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
In one incident , an old computer was stolen and papers were disturbed .
In addition , individuals have attempted to impersonate technicians in a bid to access data from his office , said Weaver .
The attempted breaches , on top of the hacking of files from British climate researcher Phil Jones , have heightened fears that climate - change deniers are mounting a campaign to discredit the work of leading meteorologists before the start of the Copenhagen climate summit tomorrow .
" The key thing is to try to find anybody who 's involved in any aspect of the IPCC and find something that you can … take out of context , " said Weaver .
The prospect of more break - ins and hacking has forced researchers to step up computer security .
Fears of further attacks by climate - change deniers have also put Copenhagen delegates under increased pressure to reach a comprehensive deal to limit carbon emissions , with Britain 's chief negotiator , energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband , warning last week that there was no certainty that a deal would be reached .
" We need to have our foot on the gas all the time , " he said on Thursday .
" We should not be complacent about getting a deal . "
It was crucial that Britain , and Europe , showed ambition in setting an agenda for a tough , binding agreement and not let the efforts of climate sceptics derail negotiations , he added .
" Our children will hold us in contempt if we fail now . "
Analysts say the key to success at Copenhagen would be the establishment of a treaty in which developed countries agree to make major carbon emission cuts while developing nations make lesser , but nevertheless significant reductions of their own .
Ultimately , the aim is to ensure that the world 's output of CO 2 begins to decline by 2020 .
If this is not achieved , temperatures will rise by more than 2C and take the world into uncontrollable global warming .
In addition , the Copenhagen summit will also have to establish a mechanism by which the west will pledge to pay billions of pounds in aid to the developing world to introduce renewable technologies and other climate - control measures .
So far , there is little sign of rapprochement , particularly over the issue of cash aid from developed countries .
" Rich nations tell us they are going to Copenhagen to seal a deal , but we say not an unfair deal .
We will never give way , " said Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamed , Sudan 's ambassador to the UN .
Bangladesh 's senior delegate was equally robust , describing the $ 10 bn so far offered by the west as " peanuts " .
However , there was more encouraging news last week when India 's prime minister , Manmohan Singh , announced he would attend the summit , joining Gordon Brown and President Barack Obama on the final day of the meeting .
India is the world 's fourth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and has just pledged to cut its carbon emissions by 20 - 25 % by 2020 .
India had previously been reluctant to commit itself to carbon cuts .
Singh 's new stance suggests his country is now prepared to be more co-operative .

American businessman Robert Kraft has admitted he is still interested in buying Liverpool .
The 68 - year - old tried to purchase the Anfield club in 2005 but lost out to fellow Americans George Gillett and Tom Hicks , who have since endured a troubled tenure .
Kraft , who owns the NFL franchise the New England Patriots , tempered any notion he could be tempted into taking the club off their hands , however , admitting he harbours reservations about the lack of a salary cap in the Premier League .

Asked if he was still interested in buying the Reds , Kraft said : " Yeah , in the right situation .
I love the game .
" I 've said this before - I love competing with fair management - how well I can manage against you .
[ But ]
I do n't like losing and at some point it 's not economic , people just throwing money at it .
" I wanted to do the deal up there but in the end we only go into business ventures where we think we can compete at a high level .
Because we like winning , and we like to win consistently . "
Kraft has enjoyed success since buying the Patriots in the mid-1990s , following which they have claimed their three Super Bowl successes in 2001 , 2003 and 2004 .
He is due to arrive in London tonight ahead of their match against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Wembley this weekend - the third time the NFL has played a regular season game in the United Kingdom .
And Kraft believes the idea of a Premier League 's 39th game would be successful in his homeland .
" We draw 50 - 60,000 people when we have teams playing an exhibition game , " he added .
" That would be smart .
That 's the sport of the world .
And this is the best media market in the world . "
The best league in the world is back .

I gave a talk a couple days ago at the Functional Programming eXchange event organised by Skills Matter in London .
Strong Types and Pure Functions
Slides Video
It was an interesting event .
We had about 50 people attend , mostly professional programmers with day jobs doing development on the JVM and .NET platforms .
Sadek Drobi gave the opening talk about computational abstraction , by which he meant monadic glue code .
He explained why we want it and showed examples in C# , Scala and F#. I had n't realised that the C# LINQ stuff is actually general monad syntax .
It was fun to see Sadek telling all these professional programmers that what they really want are functors , applicative functors and monads .
I gave a talk in the afternoon about some of the things you can do if you go all the way with FP and use a purely functional language ( rather than a hybrid ) .
I explained a technique for making interfaces where you use types to enforce which side effects are allowed .
Of course this means making custom monads so it was good that Sadek had introduced that topic in the morning .
The feedback I got was that this was one of the more technically advanced talks , but I think that was ok since it was n't essential to understand every last detail to get the point .
Overall I think it went quite well , especially given it was the first time the event has been put on .
I expect that other members of the Haskell community might like to take part in future ( Ganesh Sittampalam and Matthew Sackman also spoke this time ) .
Also , Skills Matter are planning to do an FP journal / magazine aimed at mainstream professional programmers .
Hopefully that 'll be another good way to get our message out .
Get in touch with me or Robert Pickering if you 're interested in either the conference or the journal .

Cambodia 's UN - backed war crimes court on Friday charged Khmer Rouge former head of state Khieu Samphan with genocide over the regime 's slaughter of Vietnamese people and ethnic Cham Muslims .
The 78 - year - old was already charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
" This morning Khieu Samphan has been brought before the court and informed that the charges against him have been extended to include genocide against the Chams and the Vietnamese , " said the UN - backed court 's spokesman Lars Olsen .
Up to two million Cambodians were murdered during the hardline communist regime 's four - year rule , from 1975 - 1979 .
The tribunal issued genocide charges for the first time earlier this week against two other leaders of the regime - former Khmer Rouge number two Nuon Chea and foreign minister Ieng Sary .
Last month the court announced it was investigating incursions into Vietnam as well as executions of Cambodia 's Cham minority .
It ’s only natural to want the best .

Ford is making its cars into mobile Wi -Fi hot spots .
The next generation of the Sync in - car entertainment and information system will use a USB mobile broadband modem to establish a secure wireless connection capable of supporting several devices simultaneously .
The system will be available next year on selected models -- no word yet which ones -- and you wo n't need a subscription or hardware beyond the modem .
" While you 're driving to grandma 's house , your spouse can be finishing the holiday shopping and the kids can be chatting with friends and updating their Facebook profiles , " said Mark Fields , Ford president of the Americas .
" And you 're not paying for yet another mobile subscription or piece of hardware because Ford will let you use technology you already have . "
Several automakers already offer in - car Internet access -- Japanese drivers have been using it since 1997 -- and many others are rushing to bring it to us .
Ford 's announcement follows General Motors ' promise last week to make in - car connectivity available in seven models of trucks and SUVs .
They 're the latest automakers to bring the infobahn to the autobahn .
Mercedes recently announced it has successfully tested in - vehicle Internet applications -- including web browsing , vehicle software updates and VOIP -- on a prototype 4G network .
It follows BMW 's Internet - connected iDrive system and Chrysler 's Uconnect Web in - vehicle mobile hotspot .
With so many automakers getting in on the action , there 's a push to introduce hardware standards .
Ford is taking a decidedly different approach , opting to allow consumers to plug in their own USB modem to get connected .
General Motors , on the other hand , offers a dealer - installed system called Chevrolet Wi-Fi by Autonet Mobile .
It creates a Wi-Fi hot spot 300 feet in diameter around the vehicle , and GM claims the 3G network achieves speeds of up to 1.5 mbps .
The hardware costs $ 199 after the $ 200 mail - in rebate , and the service costs $ 29 a month .
Given how connected we are , it makes sense for automakers to put the Internet in our cars .
The number of iPhones and other mobile devices being used to connect to the Internet jumped 75 percent in the third quarter of this year , according to JiWire Mobile Audiences Insights Report .
Letting people log on from the road will be a big selling point among 20 - something buyers , the so - called Millennials who have propelled much of Sync 's success .
Millennials will make up 28 percent of the driving population next year , a nine - point increase from 2004 .
Kids aside , Ford says interest in in - car connectivity is high among the general public , with one - third of people surveyed by the Consumer Electronics Association expressing interest in being able to check e-mail or surf the Web from the car .

In my last post I showed the infrastructure and logic of a simple simulation of some sticky blood platelets moving through a blood vessel .
I added the video to the end of that post ; in this post I will explain how the visualisation was implemented .
In most CHP simulations there is a barrier ( typically named tick ) that is used to keep all the simulation entities synchronised , so that they all proceed through the discrete time - steps together .
When it comes to visualising simulations , we could add a separate channel through which to report the status of all the simulation entities to a central drawing process , but this feels like a waste when all the processes are already synchronising together .
CHP has reduce channels ( many - to - one ) that are the opposite of ( one - to - many ) broadcast channels ; in a reduce channel , all the writers send in their data to a single reader , and all must send together before the communication is complete .
So a simple way to achieve visualisation is to transform the tick barrier into a reduce channel , which has the same synchronisation behaviour , but that also allows data to be sent to some drawing process .
The simulation entities do n’t need to know the details of all this , so we hide it using a send action that I ’ve called a tick action :
type TickAction = SendAction ( Maybe ( Platelet , Bool ) ) data Platelet = Platelet GLfloat
Note that I ’ve also had to tweak the type in the platelet from last time to make working with the OpenGL library a bit easier .
The only change to the site process ( and plateletGenerator and plateletPrinter processes ) is related to the change in the tick event to being an action .
Here is the site process in full :
site :: Chanin ( Maybe Platelet ) -> Chanout ( Maybe Platelet ) -> TickAction -> CHP ( ) site prevIn next
Out act = foreverFeed ( maybe empty full )
Nothing where tickWith = sendAction act empty = join .
fst < $> offer ( ( once $ readChannel prevIn ) `alongside` ( once $ writeChannel nextOut Nothing ) `alongside` ( endWhen $ tick With Nothing ) ) full platelet = do r <- liftIO $ randomRIO ( 0 , ( 1: : Double ) ) let moving = r >= 0.05 tick = tickWith ( Just ( platelet , moving ) ) mv = readChannel prevIn < &> writeChannel next
Out ( Just platelet ) probably Move = if moving then fst < $> mv else stop fromMaybe ( Just platelet ) .
fst < $> offer ( ( once probably Move ) `alongside` end When tick )
Synchronising on the tick barrier has become engaging in the tick event , where we must pass in that optional pair Maybe ( Platelet , Bool ) ; the first item is the platelet currently occupying the site , and the boolean indicates whether the platelet was willing to move on this time - step .
If the site is empty , the Nothing value is sent .
The status values end up passed to the draw function , which is fairly boring ( it draws a vertical bar ) — we are only interested in its type :
data ScreenLocation = ScreenLocation
Int deriving ( Eq , Ord ) draw :: ScreenLocation -> Maybe ( Platelet , Bool ) -> IO ()
This is called from the drawProcess :
drawProcess :: ReduceChanin ( Map. Map ScreenLocation ( Maybe ( Platelet , Bool ) ) ) -> CHP ( ) drawProcess input = do displayIO <- embedCHP_ $ do x <- readChannel input liftIO $ do startFrame mapM_ ( uncurry draw ) ( Map.toList x ) endFrame ...
Note that drawProcess takes the input end of a reduce channel which carries a map from ScreenLocation ( a one - dimensional location in our simple example ) to the Maybe ( Platelet , Bool ) values we saw .
Reduce channels in CHP must carry a monoid type , because the monoid instance is used to join all the many values from the writers into a single value ( using mappend / mconcat , but in a non-deterministic order — so make sure the monoid is commutative ) .
The Map type ( from Data . Map ) is a monoid that has union as its mappend operation .
This is exactly what we want ; each site process will send in a singleton Map with their specific screen location mapped to their current status , and using the monoid instance these maps will all be joined ( quite safely , since each sender will have a different location , and hence a distinct key entry in its Map ) into one big map , that can then be fed into the draw function as we saw above .
We do n’t trouble the site process with knowing its location ; instead , we wrap up the location in the send action .
It is easy to construct send actions that apply a function to a value before it is sent , so we apply a function that takes a status value , and turns it into the singleton Map just discussed .
This is all done as part of the wiring up of the process network , based on the version from last time :
main :: IO ( ) main = runCHP_ $ do status <- manyToOneChannel pipelineConnectCompleteT
( enrollAll ( return $ writer status ) .
zipWith withSend locationList ) plateletGenerator ( replicate numSites site ) platelet Printer < |*|> drawProcess ( reader status ) where numSites = screenSize - 2 locationList = map ScreenLocation [ 0..( screenSize - 1 ) ] withSend k p c = p $ makeSendAction ' c ( Map.singleton k )
The withSend function does the wrapping of the modification function with the send action .
Each site is given a location from the list , including the generator and printer processes ; otherwise this function is the same as the version from part 1 .
I ’ve omitted the OpenGL code , which is much the same as my previous examples .
But here , again , is the video showing the results of the visualisation :
Choose from WMV format ( suitable for Windows ) or MPEG format ( suitable for Linux , etc ) .
Turning the tick barrier into a reduce channel is often an easy way to visualise a simulation , and does n’t require too much change to the code .
As I said last time , the video is nothing compared to the TUNA videos which are very impressive , and some of which were generated by distributing the code over a cluster — a topic I hope to come to in CHP at some point in the future .
INDIGENOUS icon Ernie Dingo has hit out at hypocritical " white people " who lecture Aborigines about alcohol consumption .
" What you should be worrying about is who is giving them access ... who sells alcohol ?
Not black people , " Dingo said .
" We ( indigenous people ) do n't have a problem .
Our problem is to say ' no ' to you blokes , to white people ... ' no ' is not really part of our cultural background .
" There are more white alcoholics than there are black people in this country , so do n't come at us with restrictions and Aboriginal laws about alcohol . "
The actor was speaking after this week 's Broome premiere of Australia 's first Aboriginal musical film Bran Nue Dae .
Dingo plays an alcoholic homeless man nicknamed Tadpole .
Much of the film was shot in the North - West .
The normally genial Dingo , best known for his travel adventures on The Great Outdoors , got fired up about the depiction of Aborigines as problem drinkers .
" Aboriginal people are open people - if there 's a drink and you do n't want it in your house , you drink it in a public place , " he said .
" To us there is nothing wrong with that .
But to other people , who are so far up themselves , who look at those drunken Aborigines out there , yet they go home and they are cupboard drinkers .
" We are open with things that we do and people judge us because we are open .
" They do n't judge themselves because of what they do in the background .
" It upsets me a lot .
I 'm passionate about the fact that people talk - journalists talk - about Aboriginal people with our drinking problem .
We do n't have a drinking problem at all .
" ( The ) Aboriginal drinking problem is white people selling to them . "
Broome 's Roebuck Bay Hotel general manager Mike Windle said : " We certainly do n't give them the money to buy the alcohol and they do have the option whether they buy it or not . "
Broome Shire president Graeme Campbell said alcoholism was a complex disease that was often brought on by a range of issues , including homelessness and unemployment .
" Certainly some indigenous people are more visible , but I have no doubt that alcoholism is a problem across the whole of the community , " he said .
Alcohol restrictions have been imposed across much of the Kimberley .
Takeaway alcohol bans in Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing have been widely hailed a success .
The sale of takeaway liquor in containers of more than a litre has been banned in the Kimberley , including Broome and Kununurra .
On one level the Labour conference that ended in Brighton yesterday was a curiously dated affair in which senior party figures and their media tormentors danced to old tunes , reliving their favourite moments from the 1980s and 1990s .
Yet beneath the surface there were signs of a forward - looking maturity , a hint here and there that while Labour fears defeat there is appetite for a pre-election battle and no hunger for the near fatal , bruising internal conflict that erupted the last time it was voted out of power .
Gordon Brown 's speech epitomised the divide , managing to be outdated and forward - looking at the same time .
As I listened to him on Tuesday afternoon , announcing policy after policy in a densely argued and yet repetitive speech , I was reminded of his budgets when he was Chancellor .
It is quite something to turn the high theatre of a conference speech into the equivalent of listening to one of his budgets .
Brown has not grasped that the leader 's speech is an opportunity to mount an argument , engage in a conversation with the electorate which for once is paying a little attention .
It is not an event that needs to be studded with detailed policies .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The slogans were familiar too .
" For the many and not the few " first made its appearance in the mid-1990s .
It was back again this week , the equivalent of Harold Wilson talking about the " white hot heat of the technological revolution " at the end of his leadership as he had famously done at the beginning .
Wilson did no such thing , but he too discovered no new tunes towards the end of his leadership .
Brown 's speech proves a wider point .
Successful political leaders have only one big narrative in them and turn to it repeatedly even if the story has moved on .
But the strategic thinking implicit in the speech , its ideological underpinning in relation to " markets without morals " , and some of the policies , were much more daring than anything announced by New Labour when the world was proclaiming its boldness .
Electoral reform and some of the proposals relating to public services and social care could transform politics if they were implemented .
There is though the small matter of an election intervening before such policies get close to implementation .
The Sun newspaper made clear within hours of Brown 's speech that when the election came it was backing the Conservatives .
I was with a senior cabinet minister when he got the text with the news on Tuesday evening .
" The bastards , " he declared .
But the imperious swagger of The Sun 's senior figures as they sought to alert the Prime Minister of their move and then toured the studios to declare on " behalf of our readers " also had a dated air .
They have played the same trick too many times to generate much excitement , their equivalent of Brown returning to his favourite old slogans .
It is also worth re-reading The Sun 's endorsement of Labour at the last election .
The editorial stated it was only backing the party because of Tony Blair 's foreign policies and in particular Iraq .
It had ceased to be a Labour supporter in relation to domestic policies long before Blair had resigned .
But Labour still needs to tread carefully .
The response of some senior figures was even more dated as they baited The Sun in their speeches to angry , rapturous applause , as they used to do in the 1980s .
In modern Britain , if there is a battle between elected politicians and a non-elected media empire , there will be only one winner .
It will not be the elected politicians .
There is nothing in it for Labour in going to war with The Sun .
In spite of The Sun 's efforts , Labour is better placed to face next year 's election than it was at the start of the week , not that this is saying a great deal .
In spite of the gory headlines over the weekend there were no mutinies and no great posturing from aspiring leaders .
Instead there were signs that some of the party 's senior figures were working with a degree of determined maturity to keep the party focused .
Jon Cruddas , from the left of the party , and James Purnell , from the Blairite wing , have become something of a double act , not as part of a leadership campaign , but in an attempt to find common ground in order to avoid a fatal outbreak of post- election civil war .
Their co-operation is part of a wider move in which senior figures seek to ensure that Labour has a future .
If there is a hung parliament , Brown 's pledge to hold a referendum on electoral reform becomes highly significant .
Would the Liberal Democrats choose to support the Conservatives in such circumstances and lose the chance to change the voting system ?
I also sense more resolve now from senior figures to keep the show on the road if Labour is removed from power which is still the probable outcome .
Peter Mandelson attracted headlines for his theatrical performance this week , but his more important role is as a unifying force before the election and afterwards , in the event of a heavy defeat .
On the basis of yesterday 's closing session others seem more equipped to play significant roles too .
David Miliband 's speech yesterday was a marked improvement on the one last year partly because he managed to politicise foreign affairs , not an easy task .
The section on Europe exposed the Tories ' current daft position more effectively than he has done before .
When he spoke of their link with the far - right parties in Brussels he declared " It makes me sick " , a rare moment of Miliband passion .
There were too many pauses in the still mannered delivery but the passion humanised his performance .
Miliband 's was not the only spirited ministerial performance that suggested Labour will not die in the event of a heavy defeat at the hands of David Cameron .
In his Spectator interview this week Cameron declares " proper radicalism is thinking through how you are going to get from A to B to C to D. I think that 's what we 're doing . "
Yes , but what is " D " ?
Indeed what are " B " and " C " ?
As the least scrutinised opposition in modern history gathers for its conference in Manchester , let us hope we find out .

Tony Blair warned Gordon Brown a week ago that his campaign to become the first president of the European Council was doomed after a decisive intervention by the German chancellor Angela Merkel , according to senior Whitehall sources .
To the dismay of key ministers , who wanted Brown to push for Britain to take an economic portfolio in the European commission once Blair 's hopes were dashed , Brown insisted on maintaining his candidacy until moments before Thursday 's European summit .
The prime minister hailed the summit as a victory after Britain secured one of the two jobs created under the Lisbon treaty – the high representative for foreign policy taken by Britain 's current European commissioner , Lady Ashton .
The summit concluded quickly on Thursday , but only after weeks of horse trading across the EU and a bitter row in London .
Blair told Brown that his chances were over after a second – and decisive – phone call with Merkel late last week .
Merkel told Blair she bore him no ill will but that the job would have to go to a leader from the dominant centre right .
" Tony informed Gordon at the end of last week ... that he saw no realistic chance of getting agreement around his candidacy , " a Whitehall source said .
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen , who heads the EU grouping of Labour and social democratic parties , told the Guardian that Europe 's two big political tribes , the Christian and social democrats , agreed months ago to split the jobs between them .
He said Brown had known for some time that Blair had no chance .
" There was an expectation that at a certain time there should come a change from Downing Street ...
We all knew it could n't be otherwise , " added Rasmussen .
Senior ministers told Brown that Britain 's interests would be best served by securing a major economic portfolio in the European commission .
Brown , who agrees that new legislation on financial services could pose a threat to the City of London , did draw up contingency plans for an economic job : retain trade , or aim for the internal market or competition policy portfolios .
No 10 had not lost hope that Shriti Vadera , an ex-minister now working for the G20 , or the FSA chief Adair Turner might be persuaded to take one of these posts .
But a second group of ministers advised Brown that an economic job would have played badly in the media after Britain had made such a great play for the presidency .
Brown therefore kept Blair 's name in the frame in hope of increasing UK leverage to secure the high representative post .
" There were two groups in government , " a key figure said .
" There was the real world argument – the best interests of the UK are served by securing a strong economic portfolio to protect the City .
Then there were the media managers . "
Brown believes it is wrong to play down the significance of the high representative post , not least as Ashton will have enhanced status in the commission .
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said Ashton 's appointment may have been part of a deal that would give a major economic job to France .
" If Gordon Brown has done a deal that would mean a French commissioner being in charge of the economic issues that affect Britain the most , then that could be a serious concern , " he said .
The Guardian today reveals that Ashton was spied on by MI5 in the late 1970s .
Shami Chakrabarti , the director of Liberty and a friend of Ashton , said : " Cathy was vice - chair of CND .
She was subject to intrusive surveillance by MI5 . "

Aviation contributes up to one - fifth of warming in some areas of the Arctic .
Aircraft emissions could be having a dramatic effect on the warming of the Arctic .
A. Magurean / iStockphoto
The first analysis of emissions from commercial airline flights shows that they are responsible for 4 –8 % of surface global warming since surface air temperature records began in 1850 — equivalent to a temperature increase of 0.03 –0.06 °C overall .
The analysis , by atmospheric scientists at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , also shows that in the Arctic , aircraft vapour trails produced 15 – 20 % of warming .
The results of this analysis are likely to be studied widely as nations attempt to address the impact of commercial aviation on global warming .
There are around 35 million commercial airline flights every year .
Studies have been conducted in Europe , with airlines coming under increased pressure as European Union leaders consider levying a carbon tax on aircraft emissions .
But little research has been conducted on the topic in the United States .
Previous studies have only estimated the impacts of commercial aviation , but this is the first use of actual emissions data — from 2004 and 2006 — to calculate warming from such flights , says Mark Jacobson , a Stanford engineer who presented the analysis on 17 December at the American Geophysical Union 's annual meeting in San Francisco , California .
For the latest study , Jacobson and his team developed a model for aircraft emissions that accounts for atmospheric composition , cloudiness and the physical properties of emissions , particularly of black carbon — a major part of soot .
In his presentation , Jacobson explained how the model was applied to a nine - year simulation covering 2004 to 2013 , after breaking up flight routes into 300 - kilometre - square grids for analysis .
The model was able to calculate the characteristics of vapour trails based on the actual particulate size of emissions and their evolution over time .
Cloudy outlook
Many previous studies have assumed that the impact of aircraft emissions was the same everywhere .
But the new analysis reveals that aircraft emissions increased the fraction of cirrus clouds where vapour trails were most abundant , and actually decreased the cirrus fraction in several locations by increasing the temperatures in the lower atmosphere , reducing the relative humidity in such locations .
If black - carbon emissions from aircraft could be reduced 20 - fold , warming would be halted and a slight cooling would occur from plane - created vapour trails , Jacobson says .
The team 's study is being peer reviewed and is expected to be published soon , Jacobson added .

David Fahey , of the Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder , Colorado — part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — says that studies such as Jacobson 's are important to fill the gaps in aircraft - emissions data following the nation 's previously " muddled " research course .
Fahey says that now European leaders are calling for carbon taxes to be levied on each commercial airline flight , the United States is being driven to catch up on aircraft - emissions research .
Some of the EU proposals suggest taxing a flight for emissions along its entire route .
This is " absurd " , says Fahey .
For a more realistic levy , high - quality research is needed on the actual impact of such emissions , he adds .
Why on earth is Gordon Brown declaring class war on the Tories ?
The party tried the tactic only 18 months ago at the Crewe and Nantwich by - election when Labour supporters dressed up as " Tory toffs " .
Labour was decisively defeated .
But times have changed – utterly .
And Gordon Brown senses , correctly , for once , that something important is unfolding – hence his suggestion that the Tories ' tax policy was made on the " playing fields of Eton " .
It 's an attack with real bite , and it's a bite that will get more painful for the Tories as things get tougher economically .
Labour ditching its own plans to raise inheritance tax will likewise play well .
Because what Brown understands – finally – is that class as in issue is very far from dead .
Class has been resting somewhere out of sight , a fierce but sleeping lion , while we all lived under the illusion that we would all , some day , be rich too , and would benefit as new members of the ever - expanding privileged classes .
Now that illusion has been destroyed as it is revealed that the bailout of the banks has cost a staggering £ 850 bn – or £ 5,500 per family .

The fat cats keep grubbing up their million - pound bonuses as Christmas approaches and we work out that the Tories ' proposed inheritance tax break will be of no use to the likes of you or me .
And so the lion rises again , hungry – and angry .
It is a noble lion .
The time is ripe for good old - fashioned class hatred .
The time is ripe for voters like me , because I do – I do hate " them " .
While all that free money was sloshing about , my hatred was modulated to low - grade resentment .
But now the country stands in ruination from greed and privilege , my hate has returned .
I am rediscovering my leonine soul , as will much of the nation .
The ruling national slogans are changing .
It 's no longer : " Good luck to him , he worked hard for what he got . "
It 's eliding instead into a different trope , one that is more rooted in current reality : " That lucky , privileged bastard has insulated him / herself against all the storms the rest of us are weathering , thanks to family / inheritance / contacts / self - confidence / education / social capital .
And what 's worse , he / she whipped up the storm in the first place with the bolts and thunder of greed and recklessness . "
Oh yes , class hate is back ; or if it 's not , it 's on its way .
The voters need someone to hate , and they will vote for anyone who will mete out punishment to those they deem worthy of punishment .
It may not bring the good times back , but it will make them feel a whole lot better .
As one of those voters with an urge to punish , my hate is very approximate .
Roughly speaking , I hate the bankers , toffs , Eton schoolboys , much of the Shadow Cabinet , the privileged , tax dodgers such as Zac Goldsmith , those with offshore havens and those steeped in money and advantage who think that that is their right rather than their privilege or good fortune .
I hate whoever was complicit in , or responsible for , our downfall and who is refusing to pay the price .
My hatred is leavened with the truth that , individually , any of these people might be perfectly nice .
I have met Michael Gove on several occasions and found him utterly charming .
I have a friend who is a banker who is lovely .
I have no doubt that David Cameron is decent and that Boris Johnson is good company .
They have nice pink little cheeks ( why are they all so pink – like little pigs , do n't you think ? ) and they are clean and decent and reasonable .
So I do n't hate the people ; I hate the class .
It does n't matter that lots of them are individually " nice " or hard - working , or do charity work or treat the common herd as if they really believed that they were genuinely human .
In fact , it 's the simple innocence of the toffs , their genuine lack of understanding , their true failure to " get it " that makes me hate them .
Their inability to understand what it feels like to be excluded , the lack of grasp of the fact that good conscience is not a born attribute but as often as not an expensive commodity , as Alfred P Doolittle , Eliza 's father in Pygmalion , was so fond of pointing out .
My class hatred is a bit like racism , I expect – emotional , scattershot , somewhat feral .
Like a racist , I can recognise the individual " good " posh boy ( or girl ) , while resenting the group .
But there is an important difference from posh - hating to racism .
The people I am prejudiced against did not suffer generations of exploitation , slavery and oppression .
The people I am prejudiced about – or their class – have brought the country to its knees and are still sticking their noses in the trough , and disdainfully hanging on to their privileges like Marie Antoinette , while PR - buffing their accents into something resembling normal speech in order to fool us again that they have our best interests at heart rather than their own .
My class hatred is not some peculiar individual abnormality .
Class is the deepest river that runs through the English soul .
Roger Scruton points out in his book England : an Elegy that " class in England is the primary social fact " .
Jeremy Paxman in The English points out that the " English are obsessed by class " .
The social anthropologist Kate Fox says in her book Watching the English that in England " everything is touched by class " .
Furthermore , despite all the " enrichment " of the pre-2007 years , people have a sense of themselves as working class at heart .
In America , despite their swathes of urban and rural poor , 90 per cent consider themselves middle class .
In Britain , where only 12 per cent of the population work in manual jobs ( compare with 75 per cent a century ago ) , a remarkable 57 per cent of Britons consider themselves to be working class , according to the National Centre for Social Research .
What drives this enduring class consciousness ?
It 's not envy , as the privileged love to insist .
I 've never cared about being rich , personally , and I do n't think most ordinary people do .
Since I got on the property ladder back in the early 1980s , my house is valuable and my children will suffer if Brown abandons his plans not to extend inheritance tax levels .
But that 's fine with me .
Because it 's not fair that they should benefit .
They 're not entitled to it .
Yet the fact that the children of the rich are not " entitled " to start their lives mired in even more privilege than they already enjoy is something the posh cannot grasp – not emotionally anyway , however much they may pay lip service to it intellectually .
It 's just the damn unfairness of it all that offends basic English sensibilities .
No one objects to David Beckham 's riches , but fact that the Shadow Cabinet is stuffed with the products of private schools when only 7 per cent of the country is privately educated sticks in the collective craw .
Likewise , the top universities and professions and most particularly the judiciary – with 75 per cent privately educated – are overstuffed with posh boys and girls , and that rankles too .
The fact that private schools continue to be granted charity status compounds the offence – more tax breaks for the privileged .
The time has come for a reckoning , and again it is gradually dawning on Brown what political capital there can be made out of this .
On Friday , a succession of ministers complained publicly about the City lining its pockets as the bankers helped themselves , undeterred by the new austerity , to £ 1 m - plus bonuses .
Once so in love with the City , Labour is rapidly falling out of love .
It needs to go further .
It needs to identify the enemy – for tectonic plates are shifting , and an enemy is required .
Those tectonic plates are shifting away from David Cameron .
Why ?
Because whatever you may think of Cameron 's honesty , intelligence and policies , you simply cannot imagine , say , the Tories removing the charity status of public and private schools .
Or ratcheting up tax on the rich .
Or punishing the City bankers with windfall taxes .
Or closing offshore tax loopholes .
They may not be incapable of doing it – but you can't imagine it .
Whereas you can – just – imagine the dour old Scot turning back to his roots and having a good old soak of the privileged few in the interest of fairness and in the service of the raw emotions of the underprivileged many .
And I am absolutely sure that is what the country wants .
Because in times of crisis – and , with £ 850 bn borrowed , if a crisis is n't here already it is coming soon – the people need a scapegoat .
The toffs make a very good one .
And my God , they 've had it coming a very long time .
Always , in fact .
Four archbishops turned a blind eye to child abuse A damning report into child abuse in the Dublin archdiocese has criticised the Catholic Church hierarchy for covering up the abuse .
The report investigated how Church and state authorities handled allegations of child abuse against 46 priests .
It found that the Church placed its own reputation above the protection of children in its care .
It also said that state authorities facilitated the cover - up by allowing the Church to operate outside the law .
Reacting to the report , the current Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said " no words of apology would ever be sufficient " and offered " to each and every survivor , my apology , my sorrow and my shame for what happened to them " .
He added that the " many good priests of the archdiocese " shared his sense of shame .
The " Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin " covered a period from 1975 to 2004 .
It has laid bare a culture of concealment where church leaders prioritised the protection of their own institution above that of vulnerable children in their care .
Victims
The report said the avoidance of public outrage , which would inevitably follow high - profile prosecutions , appeared more important than preventing abusers from repeating their crimes .

Instead of reporting the allegations to civic authorities , those accused of horrific crimes were systematically shuffled from parish to parish where they could prey on new , unsuspecting victims .
The report stated : " The Dublin archdiocese 's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse , at least until the mid 1990s , were the maintenance of secrecy , the avoidance of scandal , the protection of the reputation of the Church , and the preservation of its assets . "
It also said that the archdiocese " did its best to avoid any application of the law of the state " .
It found that four archbishops - John Charles McQuaid who died in 1973 , Dermot Ryan who died in 1984 , Kevin McNamara who died in 1987 , and retired Cardinal Desmond Connell - did not hand over information on abusers .
The report said that authorities in the Dublin archdiocese who were dealing with complaints of child sexual abuse " were all very well educated people " .
It added that , considering many of them had qualifications in canon law , and in some cases civil law , their claims of ignorance were " very difficult to accept " .
Above the law Civic authorities in Ireland , especially the police , were also criticised for their cosy relationship with the Church .

The report states that senior members of the force regarded priests as being outside their remit and it claims some police officers reported abuse complaints to Church authorities instead of carrying out their own investigation .
The commissioner of the Irish police , Fachtna Murphy , said it made for " difficult and disturbing reading , detailing as it does many instances of sexual abuse and failure on the part of both Church and State authorities to protect victims " .
He added : " The commission has found that in some cases , because of acts or omissions , individuals who sought assistance did not always receive the level of response or protection which any citizen in trouble is entitled to expect from An Garda Síochána ( the Irish police ) .
He said he was " deeply sorry " for the failures .

The Irish Minister for Justice , Dermot Ahern , whose department commissioned the report , called it a " scandal on an astonishing scale " where the " welfare of children counted for nothing " .
He vowed to bring those who had carried out the abuse to justice , regardless of the amount of time which had passed .
The Commission 's work concentrated on a " representative sample " of complaints made by 320 children against 46 priests , 11 of whom were convicted of sexual assaults on children .
The number of complaints of abuse made by boys was more than double those submitted by girls .
The Commission said it was satisfied that " effective structures and procedures currently in operation " and that all complaints of clerical child sexual abuse are now reported to police .
Thursday 's report comes six months after the publication of the Ryan report in May , which took submissions from 2,000 people who said they had suffered physical and sexual abuse while in the care of Catholic - run institutions .
The Ryan report , also known as the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse , found church leaders knew that sexual abuse was " endemic " in boys ' institutions .

On the eve of A.C. Milan ’s European Champions League match with F.C. Zurich in Switzerland , and days after his thunderous goal against Sampdoria , midfielder Clarence Seedorf answered New York Times readers ’ questions .
This is the latest installment in a monthly discussion series with Seedorf .
Previous discussions can be found here .
Q .
In your opinion , what are the five most pressing concerns plaguing football today ?
As players , are your opinions heard or even considered ?
How may the fans help out ?
Rick Olivaries , Manila , Philippines
A .
1.Lack of transparency .
2. Resistance to use more technology .
3 . Market value destruction , with all the high amounts of money to pay for players and there are no ratings , no way to value .
4 . Too many games .
Lots of quantity , but less quality of the games in general .
And this is also linked directly to …
5. Increasing injuries .
These are the five aspects I ’m worried about .
I think there ’s still a lack of awareness even from players , but sooner or later things will start changing .
Players will speak out a little bit more .
But first they need to be more organized , to add value to the beautiful game .
Fans show by the questions they ’re asking me , that they are already aware .
I would encourage them to keep on connecting with their favorite players and myself to spread the word .
And be a voice for them .
The game is not only about football players but especially who is watching us because they made the sport what it is today .
Q .
Hi Clarence .
Thanks for your time .
Given the widespread and well - documented use of steroids in other sports ( American baseball , for example ) , do you worry about their impact on professional football ?
Second , much has been made of the ongoing investigation into match fixing in Europe .
What , if anything , can be done to ensure that the game is an honest competition of 11 - a - side ?
–
– Michael Miller , Mexico City
A .
No , I ’m not so worried about that .
I think in football , it ’s not very common to use drugs , and you definitely do n’t play better using drugs in football .
Maybe other sports where its much more physical .
In football , it ’s about the health in general that players should be worried about .
I ’ve heard a few interviews about the match - fixing investigation .
It ’s difficult to control everything in football .
The football market is a big market .
So to be able to control everything it should be a smaller market .
Smaller and , in many ways , better , is what I have been saying for quite a while and what I see in the future is there will some day be a European league – the N.B.A. of football .
Right now , it ’s just too big to control everything in football .
If they want to control it more , and eliminate corruption , then the government should enter in the game , because as it happened in Italy , in the Calciopoli case in 2006 , it went on at the highest stage , and it was eventually a legal case .
If government authorities get interested to help this beautiful game become more transparent , then they are the ones that need to help because I have a feeling it will be very difficult for FIFA and UEFA to investigate things that are not their own home .
They can just do so much .
Football is one environment .
That it happened in Italy it is not a big surprise that it has happened in other places too .
But it goes to my first point I mentioned — a lack of transparency .
When there is a lack of transparency , there is space for corruption .
The more lack of transparency , the more space for corruption .
More and more transparent , less and less chance to be corrupt in this world .
Q .
Mr. Seedorf ,
It is indeed a beautiful game , and your play has made it even more so over the years .
Some thoughts on the game from an American :
Do you find the system of yellow and red cards to be draconian ?
Two yellows in one world cup round = a one - game suspension in the next game ?
Is this fair ?
And when a player is red carded and ejected , must the entire team be penalized by having to play with 10 men on the field for the rest of the game ?
Thoughts ?
— Leigh , NJ
A .
I think that you can discuss these things and come up with a lot of solutions .
I think it is O.K. , two yellow cards and you miss a game .
In the World Cup , there are only seven games , maximum , so I think it is good .
It is better for the game because you will see less hard or stupid tackles and it will protect the offensive side of football .
So I do n’t have any problems with that really .
I do n’t see anything that is really negative on this , even the red card .
I think it depends .
Is it direct red ?
Is it double yellow ?
Is it a tactical foul , or is it a hard tackle ?
If I just hold the shirt of a guy going for a counterattack — a tactical foul – and I did it twice , and got caught twice , it would be two yellow cards .
I would give the guy one game not two games .
If it is a hard tackle and a direct red , I would give the guy two games or three .
Here you should have a committee of referees who watch the game on TV and consider the replay and decide with a clear conscience the gravity of the tackle .
I would do it during the game , but then we come back to the need for the use of technology .
I would do it during the game , because some tackles seem harder than they are at the time .
Sometimes you think he did n’t touch the ball , but he touched it completely .
Referees should be helped by technology .
It only takes three seconds .
I watch football and sometimes you have to wait 5 or 10 seconds just for the ball to be thrown back in the game again when it goes out of bounds .
So I think we can wait three seconds to check with this committee of referees who use technology or video replay to help the referee make the best decision possible .
When I talk about technology , video replay , yes , but not only .
There is Goal Fantasma ( sensor technology ) that should be applied for all the lines , but especially goals and off sides .
Look at tennis , they ’re even using technology more and more in other sports .
I go crazy when I see certain sports applying such simple things that add value to the game .
Even let the coach decide when .
Give him three calls in each half that he can request to get the replay .
Use the moviola , that ’s what we call the video replay in Italy .
That ’s what they do all week on TV .
What they do n’t use during the game , that ’s all they do on TV all week , over and over again .
It ’s putting pressure on the referees .
The referees do n’t have an opportunity to defend their judgment or their choices .
If it can be justified by video replay or the referee can explain what he ’s whistling for , it is an educational opportunity .
If I were a sponsor , I would want them to use some of the things that can be added value to football .
I would go crazy as a sponsor , for example , that I have to depend on the eye of the referee , when I spend millions of dollars on a team and the referee can miss something .
Fans too .
We play with people ’s feelings and we play with people ’s money .
We should try to play less with it .
Q .
Hi Clarence , I love the flow and beauty of soccer ; however , I ’ve recently become exasperated with all the diving , faking injury , and rolling around on the ground in agony .
I ’ve often commented to my wife that many players , when tackled , react as if they ’d been shot by a sniper in the stands .
The histrionics have gotten to such an extreme that it becomes distracting .
I begin to doubt the game ’s authenticity , like watching a pro wrestling match .
Many people want to know what soccer can do to change this .
But I want to know how all this is seen by those who play the game .
When a player is rolling around on the ground trying to draw a whistle , a card or a penalty , are you as exasperated as I am ?
Do you think it demonstrates a lack of respect for the game , or — as my wife argues — is it as essential to the game as the ball itself ?
A .
I totally agree .
I feel the same way .
And this is not in all countries the same .
In England it is much less .
I think it would help to use some rugby rules here .
When someone is lying on the ground , let the doctor enter , remove him and let the game go on .
It will help because a team will be left right away with 10 players and nobody wants to be at a disadvantage .
And with the diving , even if they were caught by the camera , the referee may miss it .
Nothing happens to that player .
That is the reality of the game today .
If a player is a good actor and he does it at the right moment , he can take it and get an advantage .
These are possibilities in the game today .
You ca n’t always blame the player if those are the rules , even if I think the players who do this are wrong and we should be as sporting as possible .
It is not part of my game .
I get quite irritated even when my teammates do it .
But the diving , it can happen sometimes because you expect a tackle .
You sometimes go down to minimize the impact .
Sometimes it happens that you dive , but not to get the guy a yellow card , but to avoid a hard tackle .
It has to do a lot with the reaction after the diving .
When you stand up , move on , and do n’t ask for anything , it ’s not a problem .
But I think it ’s quite clear when a player gets up and is trying to get a foul called or get the player a yellow card .
In the last game with Juventus and Inter Milan , I was quite disappointed at one point when both players were hit in one spot and they were both keeping their hands on their faces even though they were hit elsewhere .
It is a bit of a lack of respect of the game .
It is like you ’re acting like a wimp .
Do n’t be a wimp .
Q .
Hi Clarence ,
When discussing with friends about the Henry ’s handball , I tend to get two polarized reactions : one kind of fans says that is unacceptable and they feel the integrity of soccer is at stake ; another kind of fans holds that that is “ part of the game ” .
What is part of the game and what is not , from a player ’s perspective ?
Thank you very much ,
Alberto
A .
This is definitely not part of the game .
I think Thierry Henry is one of best players in the world , but I did n’t like his reaction after the goal was scored .
He could have at least enjoyed it less .
I think the integrity of the game has been touched heavily , even by the decisions made afterward .
I do n’t want to make a statement on the decisions that should have been made , but it was definitely very questionable for the credibility of this game to have a whole country not being able to make the World Cup .
Maybe they would n’t have gone to World Cup either way , because France would have scored another goal in a moment , but it made a difference .
I felt an injustice was made and I think the game should have been played again , or something should have happened in that sense .
I do n’t think it is right for the game .
It ’s not about France or Ireland anymore .
It ’s about the game .
I can understand that Henry did what he did because you do n’t really think of those things when the ball is so close to your body like that .
But it would be something if Henry said to the referee , “ I took it with my hand . ”
Because , it did n’t just touch his hand , he took his hand to it .
I would have expected something different from his perspective .
But talking afterward is difficult .
This situation would have been solved easily with more technology applied to the game at the time .
Let ’s just say I ’m disappointed .
I ’m disappointed with everything that happened .
I can only see what I can see .
It was disappointing and could be prevented .
In my opinion , it ’s not going to help to put more people out there , even two people on the goal line .
You can only see what you can see with the eye .
And it costs more to have more people on the ground .
Technology would cost less in the long term .
The most important thing is keeping it fair .
Q .
As a member of the Dutch squad for many years I was hoping you could talk about some of the turmoil that has plagued Oranje in the past , specifically the infighting and rumors of racial tension between players of Suriname descent and the coaching staff .
If any of this is true , do you think it kept the Dutch from winning the World Cup ?
With their recent run of form and the label of the best team never to win what do you think their chances are this year , and are there any of the problems of the past in this squad ?
Hartelijk dank ,
Nick
A .
No , these type of problems never existed .
Simply never existed and still do n’t exist .
And yes it is a team that could potentially have won much more , and they could potentially win more in the future , but it depends on what they do on the field .
They ’ve always tried to make it a racial issue but it has never been a racial issue .
The Dutch have performed quite well .
World Cup 1998 , semifinal .
2000 European Championship , semifinal .
Euro 2004 , semifinal again .
It ’s not that they performed badly , it ’s just that last step to the final that they ’ve not made .
Q .
What are your thoughts on implementing a salary cap , or at least closing the financial gap between the big clubs and the smaller clubs in European leagues ?
Honestly , I get sick of seeing the same three to four teams at the top of the standings every year ( La Liga , Serie A , E.P.L. , etc. ) .
Do n’t you think league play would be more interesting if the top players were more evenly distributed around each league ?
Thanks , Jeremy C .
A .
No , not in football .
You have to create a European league and then apply what you ’re saying .
And it ’s not just salaries .
Living in Milan or living in Catania are two quite different things .
I do n’t think it is something you can apply across the board because it ’s not just about the contract , but about where you live .
You do n’t want to go to places if you can avoid them if there are no international schools for your kids .
But if you had a European league , I think , with the big cities that should be involved , and it should be the best of the best , then it can automatically happen , because you can have even competition .
I think if A.C. Milan , Inter and Juventus were playing in the European league , and then you still had the Italian league , you could have something like that .
It would be more competitive because A.C. Milan and the others are n’t involved any more and it would be more the same level .
I think that sort of thing could be applied automatically when you have a European league , the N.B.A. of football .
Q .
The World Cup draw was held last week .
What do you make of the Group of Death ?
A .
We have seen the group with Brazil and I think that is the tough group .
Ivory Coast , if they come out good from the group , we have to keep an eye on them to do quite well .
They are not lucky , because last time , in 2006 , they were with Argentina and Holland .
This time , they have another tough group with Brazil and Portugal .
Also , Italy , on paper , have an easier group , but Paraguay can be difficult .
The Dutch have an easier group on paper , but Denmark can be tough .
And Cameroon is one of the better African teams .
The Americans and the English squad , I think they are the favorites to go on .
Q .
You told me that you thought the Africans would play like they have wings .
Who are the best African teams ?
Ghana and Ivory Coast are the better ones , with the most quality .
And Cameroon are a very good team .
And Nigeria had been good , but I have n’t followed them very close .
It ’s going to be very interesting because I know they will be flying all over the field and rightly so .
They have to make their people proud and make the continent proud .
And they have the responsibility and joy – I say joy because it really is a joy to make their people proud and play the World Cup on their own continent for the first time .
There 's more good news for job seekers , with a major survey of employment advertising reporting the largest gain in more than two years .
WA and Victoria led gains .
The total of jobs advertised in major metropolitan newspapers and on the internet rose 5.2 per cent last month , the ANZ bank reported in its monthly survey , reversing a 1.7 per cent drop in October .
Ads in papers alone rose 8.3 per cent .
The ANZ 's survey reiterates employment gains reported over the weekend by the Olivier recruitment group .
Official labour force figures due out on Thursday may show the economy added 5,000 jobs last month , although the unemployment rate may have edged up to 5.9 per cent as more people sought work .
'' The 8.3 % lift in newspaper job advertising in November is particularly encouraging , given that this sector tends to ' lead ' overall job advertising trends , '' said Warren Hogan , ANZ 's acting chief economist .
Along with other positive recent economic news , '' these data imply that Australia 's recovery from the recent downturn is gathering pace , '' he said .
In the 11th edition of the online magazine .
Sada al - Malahim ( The Echo of Battle ) , which was released to jihadist Web sites last week , al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) leader Nasir al - Wahayshi wrote an article that called for jihadists to conduct simple attacks against a variety of targets .
The targets included " any tyrant , intelligence den , prince " or " minister " ( referring to the governments in the Muslim world like Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Yemen ) , and " any crusaders whenever you find one of them , like at the airports of the crusader Western countries that participate in the wars against Islam , or their living compounds , trains etc. , " ( an obvious reference to the United States and Europe and Westerners living in Muslim countries ) .
Al - Wahayshi , an ethnic Yemeni who spent time in Afghanistan serving as a lieutenant under Osama bin Laden , noted these simple attacks could be conducted with readily available weapons such as knives , clubs or small improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) .
According to al - Wahayshi , jihadists " do n't need to conduct a big effort or spend a lot of money to manufacture 10 grams of explosive material " and that they should not " waste a long time finding the materials , because you can find all these in your mother 's kitchen , or readily at hand or in any city you are in . "
That al - Wahayshi gave these instructions in an Internet magazine distributed via jihadist chat rooms , not in some secret meeting with his operational staff , demonstrates that they are clearly intended to reach grassroots jihadists — and are not intended as some sort of internal guidance for AQAP members .
In fact , al - Wahayshi was encouraging grassroots jihadists to " do what Abu al - Khair did " referring to AQAP member Abdullah Hassan Taleh al - Asiri , the Saudi suicide bomber who attempted to kill Saudi Deputy Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef with a small IED on Aug. 28 .
The most concerning aspect of al - Wahayshi's statement is that it is largely true .
Improvised explosive mixtures are in fact relatively easy to make from readily available chemicals — if a person has the proper training — and attacks using small IEDs or other readily attainable weapons such as knives or clubs ( or firearms in the United States ) are indeed quite simple to conduct .
As STRATFOR has noted for several years now , with al Qaeda 's structure under continual attack and no regional al Qaeda franchise groups in the Western Hemisphere , the most pressing jihadist threat to the U.S. homeland at present stems from grassroots jihadists , not the al Qaeda core .
This trend has been borne out by the large number of plots and arrests over the past several years , to include several so far in 2009 .
The grassroots have likewise proven to pose a critical threat to Europe ( although it is important to note that the threat posed by grassroots operatives is more widespread , but normally involves smaller , less strategic attacks than those conducted by the al Qaeda core ) .
From a counterterrorism perspective , the problem posed by grassroots operatives is that unless they somehow self - identify by contacting a government informant or another person who reports them to authorities , attend a militant training camp , or conduct electronic correspondence with a person or organization under government scrutiny , they are very difficult to detect .
The threat posed by grassroots operatives , and the difficulty identifying them , highlight the need for counterterrorism programs to adopt a proactive , protective intelligence approach to the problem — an approach that focuses on " the how " of militant attacks instead of just " the who . "
The How
In the traditional , reactive approach to counterterrorism , where authorities respond to a crime scene after a terrorist attack to find and arrest the militants responsible for the attack , it is customary to focus on the who , or on the individual or group behind the attack .
Indeed , in this approach , the only time much emphasis is placed on the how is either in an effort to identify a suspect when an unknown actor carried out the attack , or to prove that a particular suspect was responsible for the attack during a trial .
Beyond these limited purposes , not much attention is paid to the how .
In large part , this focus on the who is a legacy of the fact that for many years , the primary philosophy of the U.S. government was to treat counterterrorism as a law - enforcement program , with a focus on prosecution rather than on disrupting plots .
Certainly , catching and prosecuting those who commit terrorist attacks is necessary , but from our perspective , preventing attacks is more important , and prevention requires a proactive approach .
To pursue such a proactive approach to counterterrorism , the how becomes a critical question .
By studying and understanding how attacks are conducted — i.e. , the exact steps and actions required for a successful attack — authorities can establish systems to proactively identify early indicators that planning for an attack is under way .
People involved in planning the attack can then be focused on , identified , and action can be taken prevent them from conducting the attack or attacks they are plotting .
This means that focusing on the how can lead to previously unidentified suspects , e.g. , those who do not self - identify .
" How was the attack conducted ? " is the primary question addressed by protective intelligence , which is , at its core , a process for proactively identifying and assessing potential threats .
Focusing on the how , then , requires protective intelligence practitioners to carefully study the tactics , tradecraft and behavior associated with militant actors involved in terrorist attacks .
This allows them to search for and identify those behaviors before an attack takes place .
Many of these behaviors are not by themselves criminal in nature ; visiting a public building and observing security measures or standing on the street to watch the arrival of a VIP at their office are not illegal , but they can be indicators that an attack is being plotted .
Such legal activities ultimately could be overt actions in furtherance of an illegal conspiracy to conduct the attack , but even where conspiracy cannot be proved , steps can still be taken to identify possible assailants and prevent a potential attack — or at the very least , to mitigate the risk posed by the people involved .
Protective intelligence is based on the fact that successful attacks do n't just happen out of the blue .
Rather , terrorist attacks follow a discernible attack cycle .
There are critical points during that cycle where a plot is most likely to be detected by an outside observer .
Some of the points during the attack cycle when potential attackers are most vulnerable to detection are while surveillance is being conducted and weapons are being acquired .
However , there are other , less obvious points where people on the lookout can spot preparations for an attack .
It is true that sometimes individuals do conduct ill - conceived , poorly executed attacks that involve shortcuts in the planning process .
But this type of spur - of - the - moment attack is usually associated with mentally disturbed individuals and it is extremely rare for a militant actor to conduct a spontaneous terrorist attack without first following the steps of the attack cycle .
To really understand the how , protective intelligence practitioners cannot simply acknowledge that something like surveillance occurs .
Rather , they must turn a powerful lens on steps like preoperational surveillance to gain an in - depth understanding of them .
Dissecting an activity like preoperational surveillance requires not only examining subjects such as the demeanor demonstrated by those conducting surveillance prior to an attack and the specific methods and cover for action and status used .
It also requires identifying particular times where surveillance is most likely and certain optimal vantage points ( called perches in surveillance jargon ) from where a surveillant is most likely to operate when seeking to surveil a specific facility or event .
This type of complex understanding of surveillance can then be used to help focus human or technological countersurveillance efforts where they can be most effective .
Unfortunately , many counterterrorism investigators are so focused on the who that they do not focus on collecting this type of granular how information .
When we have spoken with law enforcement officers responsible for investigating recent grassroots plots , they gave us blank stares in response to questions about how the suspects had conducted surveillance on the intended targets .
They simply had not paid attention to this type of detail — but this oversight is not really the investigators ' fault .
No one had ever explained to them why paying attention to , and recording , this type of detail was important .
Moreover , it takes specific training and a practiced eye to observe and record these details without glossing over them .
For example , it is quite useful if a protective intelligence officer has first conducted a lot of surveillance , because conducting surveillance allows one to understand what a surveillant must do and where he must be in order to effectively observe surveillance of a specific person or place .
Similarly , to truly understand the tradecraft required to build an IED and the specific steps a militant needs to complete to do so , it helps to go to an IED school where the investigator learns the tradecraft firsthand .
Militant actors can and do change over time .
New groups , causes and ideologies emerge , and specific militants can be killed , captured or retire .
But the tactical steps a militant must complete to conduct a successful attack are constant .
It does n't matter if the person planning an attack is a radical environmentalist , a grassroots jihadist or a member of the al Qaeda core , for while these diverse actors will exhibit different levels of professionalism in regard to terrorist tradecraft , they still must follow essentially the same steps , accomplish the same tasks and operate in the same areas .
Knowing this allows protective intelligence to guard against different levels of threats .
Of course , tactics can be changed and perfected and new tactics can be developed ( often in response to changes in security and law enforcement operations ) .
Additionally , new technologies can emerge ( like cell phones and Google Earth ) — which can alter the way some of these activities are conducted , or reduce the time it takes to complete them .
Studying the tradecraft and behaviors needed to execute evolving tactics , however , allows protective intelligence practitioners to respond to such changes and even alter how they operate in order to more effectively search for potential hostile activity .
Technology does not only aid those seeking to conduct attacks .
There are a variety of new tools , such as Trapwire , a software system designed to work with camera systems to help detect patterns of preoperational surveillance , that can be focused on critical areas to help cut through the fog of noise and activity and draw attention to potential threats .
These technological tools can help turn the tables on unknown plotters because they are designed to focus on the how .
They will likely never replace human observation and experience , but they can serve as valuable aids to human perception .
Of course , protective intelligence does not have to be the sole responsibility of federal authorities specifically charged with counterterrorism .
Corporate security managers and private security contractors should also apply these principles to protecting the people and facilities in their charge , as should local and state police agencies .
In a world full of soft targets — and limited resources to protect those targets from attack — the more eyes looking for such activity the better .
Even the general public has an important role to play in practicing situational awareness and spotting potential terrorist activity .
Keeping it Simple ?
Al - Wahayshi is right that it is not difficult to construct improvised explosives from a wide range of household chemicals like peroxide and acetone or chlorine and brake fluid .
He is also correct that some of those explosive mixtures can be concealed in objects ranging from electronic items to picture frames , or can be employed in forms ranging from hand grenades to suicide vests .
Likewise , low - level attacks can also be conducted using knives , clubs and guns .
Furthermore , when grassroots jihadists plan and carry out attacks acting as lone wolves or in small compartmentalized cells without inadvertently betraying their mission by conspiring with people known to the authorities , they are not able to be detected by the who - focused systems , and it becomes far more difficult to discover and thwart these plots .
This focus on the how absolutely does not mean that who - centered programs must be abandoned .
Surveillance on known militants , their associates and communications should continue , efforts to identify people attending militant training camps or fighting in places like Afghanistan or Somalia must be increased , and people who conduct terrorist attacks should be identified and prosecuted .
However — and this is an important however — if an unknown militant is going to conduct even a simple attack against some of the targets al - Wahayshi suggests , such as an airport , train , or specific leader or media personality , complexity creeps into the picture , and the planning cycle must be followed if an attack is going to be successful .
The prospective attacker must observe and quantify the target , construct a plan for the attack and then execute that plan .
The demands of this process will force even an attacker previously unknown to the authorities into a position where he is vulnerable to discovery .
If the attacker does this while there are people watching for such activity , he will likely be seen .
But if he does this while there are no watchers , there is little chance that he will become a who until after the attack has been completed .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner fiercely battled against the suggestion he step down from his post in light of growing concerns from both the left and right over his leadership .
In a fiery exchange at Thursday 's Joint Economic Committee hearing with ranking Republican Kevin Brady ( Texas ) , who suggested that Geithner had " failed " and should reconsider his job , the Treasury secretary asserted that he and his team had made great strides bringing the economy back from " the brink . "

" I agree with almost nothing of what you said , " replied a heated Geithner , charging President George W. Bush 's leadership was to blame for the country 's financial woes .
" Again , it 's just a basic fact : A year ago , this economy was falling at the rate of 6 percent a year .
We were losing between half a million and three - quarters of a million jobs a month , " he said , noting those numbers changed when President Barack Obama took office .
That explanation , however , hardly satisfied Brady , who shot back that the country " has lost all confidence in your ability to do the job . "
He also said Geithner 's failure was beginning " to reflect on your president .
" Sensing the exchange was about to grow more pointed , Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney ( D - N.Y. ) informed Brady his time had expired .
But Geithner still returned fire , blaming " almost a decade of public neglect , " and the economic harm that it wrought on the country , on the Bush administration .
Replied Brady , " Tell all of that to the millions of Americans who no longer have jobs because of your decisions . "
A number of lawmakers this week , including Democrats , have questioned whether the Treasury 's recovery efforts have prioritized Wall Street at " Main Street 's " expense .
" A growing consensus in the caucus [ believe that Geithner should be removed ] , " Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D - Ore. ) said on MSNBC on Wednesday , a statement Brady cited during Thursday 's hearing .
But Geithner left no doubt about the future of his job .
" If you look at any measure of consumer and investor confidence today , if you look at any measure of the stability and health of the economy ... it is substantially stronger today than when the president of the United States took office , " he said .
" And that did not happen on its own . "
Cat stomped to death in film draws outrage
( Shanghai Daily )
Updated : 2006-03-03 08:41
Cyber sadists have figured out a way to profit from cruelty to small creatures , and animal rights activists say it 's high time China enacts tough laws to stamp out such abuse .
Several Websites have cropped up recently offering videos and still photos of dogs , cats , rabbits and toads being stomped to death by a sexy woman wearing stockings and high heels .
Woman in sexy clothes caresses a kitten 's fur along a riverbank .
[ sohu ]
Then she puts the small kitten on the ground .
[ sohu ]
She stomps on the head of the kitten with her high - heeled shoes and crushes it into death at last .
[ sohu ]
These images are usually linked with more typical sadomasochistic fare consisting of a female in stiletto heels tramping on the chest of a man .
A Shanghai Daily investigation turned up several such sites , offering " Gts , ' ' which stands for " great women , small men " and " Crush ' ' products .
Animal " snuff " videos were posted on these sites for sale at 15 yuan ( US $ 1.87 ) each .
There were bulletin boards for fetish fans , who could even join a group called the International Crushing Association .
At least one of the sites was reportedly registered in Hangzhou , Zhejiang Province .
Several disturbing videos were offered for free .
It was impossible to tell where they were made , and while Shanghai Daily could not confirm that animals were actually being killed in the videos , the content appeared to be authentic .
In one , a scantily clad woman with Chinese features posed with a small kitten along a riverbank , at first gently caressing the animal 's fur .
She then began stomping on the kitten with her high - heeled shoes , crushing its body and head and leaving it in a lifeless , bloody heap .
One Website , www.crushworld.net, was shut down after a Chinese newspaper contacted it to complain , and animal lovers left numerous angry messages on some of the other Crush sites .
At least one of the sellers , however , was unrepentant .
" These movies are not nasty ; I do n't think they 're illegal , " a man surnamed Han who markets the videos online told the Shanghai Morning Post .
Han said he offers dozens of different videos and has sold hundreds of discs to people from all over the country since he started the business two years ago .
" All the videos I sell show beauties dressed in sexy clothes crushing a small animal to death , " he said .
" They are selling very well . "
Zhang Haiyin , director of the Shanghai Mental Consultation Center , said the people who buy these products are disturbed individuals who may take pleasure in seeing another living creature suffer because they can't achieve their own life goals .
" These people are most likely those who can't realize their own dreams . "
Animal rights activists care little about the motivation behind the videos .
They just want the cruelty stopped .
He Yong , a spokesman for the Beijing office of the International Fund for Animal Welfare , said these videos point up the need for laws preventing cruelty to animals .
China 's present legislation is too vague to be much good , critics say .
" Our group has n't looked into the source of these videos , but for the sake of these animals and for humans as well China needs laws to protect small creatures from harm , " He said .
" Those who are heartless enough to harm animals may also be potential threats to the people around them . "
The Observer reports that an estimated $ 352bn of drug and mafia money was laundered by the major banks at the peak of the credit crunch , while regulators turned a blind eye , since the highly liquid criminal underworld was the only source of the cash necessary to keep the banks ' doors open .
As Charlie Stross notes , " A third of a trillion dollars is a lot of money ; it 's enough to fund the US military invading another country halfway around the world , or a manned Mars exploration program . "
Charlie goes on to mention that now that these narcobucks " are n't neatly bundled up inside the mattress any more ; they 're in the system , " that there 's $ 0.3 trillion sitting there , nice and legal , entering the investment world .
Antonio Maria Costa , head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , said he has seen evidence that the proceeds of organised crime were " the only liquid investment capital " available to some banks on the brink of collapse last year .
He said that a majority of the $ 352bn ( £ 216bn ) of drugs profits was absorbed into the economic system as a result …
" Inter - bank loans were funded by money that originated from the drugs trade and other illegal activities …
There were signs that some banks were rescued that way . "
Costa declined to identify countries or banks that may have received any drugs money , saying that would be inappropriate because his office is supposed to address the problem , not apportion blame .
But he said the money is now a part of the official system and had been effectively laundered .
" That was the moment [ last year ] when the system was basically paralysed because of the unwillingness of banks to lend money to one another .
The progressive liquidisation to the system and the progressive improvement by some banks of their share values [ has meant that ] the problem [ of illegal money ] has become much less serious than it was , " he said .

KABUL , Afghanistan 
The American commander in charge of training the Afghan security forces said Wednesday that there had been a recent wave of recruits for the Afghan Army , most likely because of a pay increase that he said put salaries close to those of Taliban fighters .
The commander , Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV , said that an Afghan soldier in a high - combat area like Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan would now make a starting salary of $ 240 a month , up from $ 180 .
General Caldwell said that the Taliban often paid insurgents $ 250 to $ 300 a month .
The Afghan Army pay increase was announced 10 days ago , General Caldwell said .
In the first seven days of December , more than 2,600 Afghans signed up  a striking change , he said , from September , when there were 831 Afghan recruits for the entire month , or November , when there were 4,303 recruits .
General Caldwell was at Camp Eggers in Kabul , the headquarters of the American effort to train the Afghans .
He was speaking to reporters traveling with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who was on his second day of a trip to Afghanistan focusing in part on Afghan training .
Rendition Case Tests FBI Immunity

Twenty - four - year - old Amir Meshal , the son of Muslim immigrants from Egypt , was a lifelong resident of New Jersey when , after living briefly in Cairo with extended family members , in 2006 he decided to go to Somalia to study Islam and experience living under Islamic law .
The country appeared to have stabilized and a new Islamic government was on good terms with the United States .
But Somalia was n’t as stable as Meshal had thought , and as violence erupted there again in January 2007 , Meshal fled , along with many Somali civilians .
He was arrested in a joint U.S. - Kenyan - Ethiopian operation along the border of Kenya .
[ Law1 ] During the next four months , Meshal says , he was detained and interrogated in three different African countries without charge , denied the right to speak to a lawyer or family member , and refused the right to even appear before a judicial officer .
Although a lifelong U.S. citizen with two U.S. citizen parents , Meshal was repeatedly threatened with torture , rendition to another country where he would be tortured , and forced disappearance .
And he believes that U.S. officials , who interrogated him more than 30 times during this process , directed his arrest and treatment .
Those claims are the subject of a new lawsuit being filed Tuesday by the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington .
Although it ’s not the first lawsuit against U.S. officials seeking damages for torture and other mistreatment abroad , Meshal is only the second U.S. citizen to sue for U.S. - sponsored torture .
That and a few other distinctive facts in this case may give him some advantages over those that have been dismissed .
“ This is a U.S. citizen who was caught in hostilities abroad , and instead of helping him return , U.S. officials abused him and mistreated him and never charged him with a crime , ” said Nusrat Choudhury , one of the lead lawyers from the ACLU representing Meshal .
“ Should they be allowed to do that without helping a U.S. citizen get home , and instead , denying him access to lawyers ? ”
That ’s the question that will face judges in this case .
In the past , the government has managed to convince courts to dismiss torture victims ’ cases by saying that government officials are entitled to qualified immunity , or that the case would reveal state secrets , or that courts should not imply a right to sue government officials for constitutional violations when the case involves national security and foreign policy .
But will courts be so willing to dismiss a case brought by a U.S. citizen , born to U.S. citizen parents , allegedly tortured directly by U.S. officials , and who has never even been charged with doing anything wrong ?
American University Law Professor Stephen Vladeck , an expert on constitutional and national security law , says that although doctrinally the cases are not very different , the fact that Meshal is a U.S. citizen “ practically , could make a difference to judges , ” he said .
“ It would just highlight how wrong those other decisions are , ” he said .
One of those decisions is Rasul v. Rumsfeld , decided by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year .
In that case , the court dismissed the claims of four British men who ’d been detained and allegedly abused at Guantanamo Bay because , the court reasoned , the federal officials were entitled to “ qualified immunity ” because it was not clear that Guantanamo detainees had rights under the U.S. Constitution at the time of their alleged abuse .
In that case , though , which is still on appeal ( the Supreme Court remanded it back to the D.C. Circuit for reconsideration in light of intervening Supreme Court precedents ) , the court ’s reasoning was based in part on the fact that the plaintiffs were all “ aliens ” — none were lawful U.S. citizens or residents .
Meshal ’s U.S. citizenship may make his case more difficult to dismiss .
“ Mr. Meshal alleges there needs to be discovery in this case to determine whether what those officers did was objectively reasonable , ” said Choudury , his lawyer .
“ Should an FBI officer think it ’s objectively reasonable to threaten a U.S. citizen to send him to place where he will be tortured ? ”
Interestingly , recently released documents produced in the ACLU ’s Freedom of Information
Act case against the government have revealed memos written by FBI interrogation specialists in 2002 and sent to Defense Department officials specifically explaining that threatening a detainee with torture , death or disappearance is a violation of the U.S. Constitution and the anti-torture law .
That could weaken the government ’s argument that FBI officials reasonably thought it was legal to threaten Meshal in 2007 .
The most recent case decided that presents similar facts is the case of Maher Arar , dismissed this month for the second time by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals .
Arar , a Canadian citizen , was arrested by U.S. authorities while he was changing planes at JFK airport in New York in 2002 .
Arar was held briefly in the states , denied access to a lawyer , then rendered to Syria where he was held in a grave - like cell and interrogated under torture , he says , for almost a year .
He was finally released without charge ; Syrian authorities acknowledged that they had no evidence against him .
Arar sued the U.S. government for complicity in his treatment abroad .
The court last week ruled that he has no right to sue under the U.S. Constitution in this case because the claims would “ have the natural tendency to affect diplomacy , foreign policy , and the security of the nation . ”
As for his claims under the Torture Victims Protection Act , enacted to protect victims of torture in other countries , Arar could not claim compensation from U.S. authorities because it was the Syrians who tortured him , even if U.S. officials knew that he was likely to be tortured when they sent him to Syria , the court ruled .
In addition to the fact that Meshal is a U.S. citizen , his case may stand a better chance because he is suing the actual FBI officials who he claims conducted his interrogation and threatened him with torture , forced disappearance and execution to coerce him into confessing to associations with al - Qaeda that he says he does not have .
“ It was a Kenyan jail , but he is alleging that U.S. officials were complicit with those officials in keeping him detained in secret , ” said Choudhury .
“ During interrogations , U.S. government officials threatened to send him to Israel , where they would make him disappear . ”
Meshal ’s constitutional claims may also fare better because there appears to be nowhere else to bring them — an important factor courts consider .
The government claimed that Arar , as a Canadian , could have objected to his rendition before U.S. immigration authorities .
( Arar ’s lawyers disputed that . )
In this case , there appears to be no alternative means for redress .
Meshal has declined to speak to reporters about his ordeal , but according to his legal complaint , while he was in Kenya , Meshal repeatedly asked to speak to a lawyer , to his father , and to the international Committee of the Red Cross ; his requests were denied .
He was allowed to speak once to a U.S. consular official in Kenya who said he would help Meshal .
Before the consular official could do anything , though , Meshal was handcuffed , hooded and flown to Somalia , where he feared he would be killed , he says .
Meshal was deposited in an excruciatingly hot 25 - foot - square cave , without windows or toilets .
When guards opened the door of the cell , Meshal “ noticed that enormous cockroaches were clustered in the corners of the cell and large black millipedes were all over the walls , ” the legal complaint charges .
Meshal says he was left there , handcuffed in the dark , for two days .
He was then moved to a storage tent where he was given one meal a day of biscuits , marmalade and water .
He was left there for about four days until he was transferred to Ethiopia for further interrogation .
The government could still argue that the “ state secrets privilege ” should doom the case .
In many cases charging government wrongdoing in the national security arena , the Justice Department has argued that allowing a lawsuit to go forward would reveal sensitive state secrets and endanger national security .
The government ’s frequent invocation of the state secrets privilege has become something of a political embarrassment , however .
In February , Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) introduced a bill , which now has nine co-sponsors , that would severely limit the government ’s ability to dismiss cases on that ground .
Shortly after , Attorney General Eric Holder in September announced a new policy on state secrets , pledging to use the privilege more sparingly and according to strict new rules .
However , he has continued to assert it in situations where advocates say the case should move forward , with the judge simply reviewing any sensitive evidence behind closed doors .
“ It seems unlikely the government would n’t invoke state secrets again , ” said David Luban , a law professor at Georgetown University and expert on legal ethics and international law .
In this case , Luban said , the government would likely claim that allowing the cases to move forward would expose sensitive information about the United States ’ relationships or agreements with the other countries that Meshal was rendered to .
And “ if the action is being shut off because of state secrets , ” he said , “ I do n’t think you can get around that . ”
“ The government can raise that in the course of litigation , ” Choudhury agreed .
“ But that ’s not a reason for this case not to go forward . ”
The government would still have to convince a court that national security would be put at risk simply by responding to requests about the FBI ’s treatment of one individual and its role in his rendition and alleged torture .
Some courts have been skeptical about that argument , although in the case of German citizen Khaled Al - Masri , a lawsuit filed by a rendition victim against U.S. authorities , a federal judge in Virginia did dismiss the case on state secrets grounds .
And the court could still decide to dismiss the case based on its broader national security implications , as it did in Arar .
“ What ’s been so disturbing is how judges have bent backwards to say this is a new kind of claim , ” said Vladeck .
In the Arar case , for example , the court cast his claim for compensation for extraordinary rendition as a new kind of constitutional claim that would require the court essentially to create a new right to sue .
The court then could easily decline to create that new right , citing the “ special factors ” involved — in particular , the potential impact on national security and foreign policy .
“ What ’s so distressing about Arar was that the Second Circuit endorsed such a limitless view of special factors , ” said Vladeck .
“ If Arar ’s rendition case ca n’t prevail , then I ’m pressed to see what kind of case can win . ”
Still , one case has survived dismissal so far .
That ’s the case of Jose Padilla , a U.S. citizen deemed an “ enemy combatant ” , who is now suing John Yoo , the former lawyer at the Justice Department who justified torture and Padilla says personally helped to devise his illegal treatment .
Although the Obama administration , representing
Yoo , tried to have the case dismissed , a federal court in California refused , in part because there was no other way for a U.S. citizen to hold U.S. officials accountable .
Padilla was also the only U.S. citizen to have sued a U.S. official for torture .
Until now .
Choudhury hopes , at least , that Meshal ’s U.S. citizenship might also make some difference .
But the outcome is hard to predict .
Judges and courts are sharply divided on when a victim of abusive federal government policies should have a right to bring their claims to court .
When the full Second Circuit court ruled in Arar ’s case last week , the decision included four powerful dissents .
“ The majority would immunize official misconduct by invoking the separation of powers and the executive ’s responsibility for foreign affairs and national security , ” wrote Judge Barrington Parker , in one of them .
“ Its approach distorts the system of checks and balances essential to the rule of law , and it trivilializes the judiciary ’s role in these arenas , ” he continued .
The executive ’s powers in foreign policy and national security “ are not limitless ” and their “ bounds in both wartime and peacetime are fixed by the same Constitution , ” he wrote .
The court ’s refusal to allow Arar a remedy , he continued , “ immunizes official conduct directly at odds with the express will of Congress and the most basic guarantees of liberty contained in the Constitution .
By doing so , the majority risks a government that can interpret the law to suits its own ends , without scrutiny . ”

In its Wednesday edition Crikey exposed the hypocrisy of the Australian Tax Office .
The article is called The ATO ’s business needs : lest we forget and is well worth a read to see how public service bosses really treat their staff .
The ATO sent a note to its Operations staff about reflecting on Remembrance Day on 11 November .
The day commemorates the end of World War One .
Traditionally there is a minute ’s silence at 11 a.m .
Not in the ATO .
Apart from jingoistic claptrap and the re-writing of history ( more of which later ) the note says :
If you wish to observe a moment ’s silence you should speak to your manager , allowing them the opportunity to assess the business needs of your area prior to approving your request .
That seems pretty clear .
You ca n’t take time off to reflect on the ruling class mythologies about the end of the first world war .
You need to keep working unless you get your boss ’s permission .
Well , that ’s not a good look to the tens of thousands of Tax Officers for whom Remembrance Days means something .
And to snivelling patriots like the HowRudd Government and the Turnbull Opposition , the ATO ’s position would provoke howls of fake outrage .
The ATO looked like it could be heading for a PR nightmare .
So it sent out a second memo , and after a bit of groveling about how important Remembrance Day was , the Office went on to explain that :
in Operations many workplaces have ongoing high levels of phone contact with taxpayers that are often generated by taxpayers from other time zones .
It is in these workplaces that it is important to discuss with your team leader , ahead of time , how the Remembrance occasion at 11.00 am can occur in your particular workplace , so that everyone has an opportunity to reflect and pay their respects .
Ah , what a sweet way to climb down .
Whoever wrote that should join Kev ’s spin team .
Operations employs about 9000 of the 23000 ATO Staff .
It runs , among other things , the ATO ’s call centres , those battery cages of humanity .
Operations was the stalking horse last year for management plans to cut staff and hours to counterbalance the ATO ’s budget blow out caused by the misnamed Change Program .
That program is about technology organising humans .
It has doubled in cost and is running a couple of years behind schedule .
At the time there was a backlash against what one union said would be the loss of 3000 Operations staff .
Management retreated , although reducing labor costs is still their main strategy for dealing with the budget crisis .
Like all bosses ATO management wants to screw more and more out of their workers .
Hence their concerns about staff spending 60 seconds reflecting on the futility of war , the nature of imperialism , and the need for a new society based on co-operation rather than economic and military competition .
Well that ’s what I used to think about when the voice came over the Tax Office PA system in Canberra urging us to remember the fallen .
That ’s the problem for bosses .
National myths are OK except when they cut into productive work time .
You could just imagine some of them asking why could n’t the remembrance be at 11 pm instead of 11 am ?
The ATO certainly mythologised how the war ended .
Here ’s what they said in their first memo to staff :
At 11 am on 11 November 1918 , four years of continuous warfare ceased as allied armies drove German invaders back after inflicting heavy defeats over the previous four months .
Here ’s little bit of background the ATO did n’t mention .
The war deeply divided Australian society along class lines .
The conscription referendums became a lighting rod for opposition to the imperialist battle .
The Labor Party split .
A general strike paralysed New South Wales .
Some returning soldiers , radicalised by the war , helped build the newly formed Communist Party .
In Europe workers took power in Russia and revolutions broke out across the Continent .
Here ’s how I put it in Remembrance Day – the battle for the future :
The First World War – the War to end all Wars – created revolutions across Europe .
The most well known is the 1917 Russian Revolution when workers created their own democratic organs of rule – workers ’ councils – and took power .
But how many readers know that it was the outbreak of revolution in Germany in November 1918 that forced the Kaiser to abdicate and the German equivalent of the ALP to declare a republic .
The revolution , together with a worsening military position and the failure of the Spring Offensive , saw the German forces sue for peace and the Armistice declared from 11 am on 11 November 1918 .
A little background .
The Russian Revolution – with its slogans of “ all power to the workers ’ councils ” and “ land , bread and peace ” – inspired workers around the world , including German workers .
For example in early January 1918 nearly half a million workers went on strike in Berlin for peace .
The German working class was in ferment over the misery and destruction the war was producing .
The worsening military situation heightened that ferment .
In early November 1918 the German military ordered the fleet at Kiel to fight the British Navy .
The sailors knew they would be going to their death , for no reason .
So they mutinied , and within two days workers and the rank and file military ran the city .
Within a week councils of workers and soldiers ran Germany .
When workers took control of Berlin the Kaiser fled and the German ALP declared ( against their will but under pressure from workers ) the German Republic .
Two days later the armistice was in place .
As the ATO missives to staff show , this is a message our bosses do n’t want us to remember .
Instead of glorifying war , take that minute on November 11 to remember the great struggle of German workers that overthrew the Kaiser and ended the war .
And remember this .
We have the power today to overthrow our rulers and their managers and create a truly democratic society where war is banished to the museum .
Of course , the shuttles can't travel out to deep space .

A woman who made a false rape claim after having sex with two teenagers has been jailed for a year .
Victoria Salter , of Lostock Hall , told police in September last year she was raped by three men while one looked on .
This led to the arrest of three 17 - year - olds but one of them had filmed the incident which proved the sex was consensual , the court heard .
Salter , 26 , who earlier admitted perverting the course of justice was jailed at Preston Crown Court .
Salter , of Broad Meadow , dialled 999 to make the false report in September 2008 .
She said she had been followed home by four men and was raped by three of them while the fourth watched .
But the court heard that Salter had been filmed on a mobile phone during the sexual encounter and had been partaking " enthusiastically " .
Just as I was informing the unlucky messenger that the second night ’s show would be “ even more Jewish , ” places were called .
I bounded onstage in time to belt out the opening lines of “ We Need a Little Christmas , ” wearing a fake grin that barely concealed my rage .
After a while , the music calmed me down , and I was able to merge with the holiday spirit encoded in the Jerry Herman classic .
The Jewish Jerry Herman Christmas classic .

The evolution of Christmas is reflected to a degree in its music .
As the holiday has become more secular , so have its songs , with religious and spiritual compositions largely supplanted by the banalities of Rudolph , sleigh bells and Santa .
Many Christians feel that the true essence of Christmas has been lost , and I respect that opinion .
It must be difficult to see religious tradition eroded in the name of commerce and further dissipated by others ’ embrace of a holiday without a sense of what it truly means to the faithful .
Yet I also hope that those who feel this encroachment will on some level understand that the spirit of the holiday is universal .
We live in a multicultural time and the mixing , and mixing up , of traditions is an inevitable result .
Hence we have the almost century - old custom of American Jews creating a lot more Christmas music than Hanukkah music .
If you look at a list of the most popular Christmas songs , you ’ll find that the writers are disproportionately Jewish : Irving Berlin ’s “ White Christmas , ” “ The Christmas Song ” ( yes , Mel Tormé was Jewish ) , “ Let It Snow ! Let It Snow ! Let It Snow ! , ” “ I ’ll Be Home for Christmas , ” “ Silver Bells , ” “ Santa Baby , ” “ Rudolph the Red- Nosed Reindeer ” and “ Winter Wonderland ”  perennial , beloved and , mostly , written for the sheet music publishers of Tin Pan Alley , not for a show or film .
( Two notable exceptions : “ White Christmas , ” introduced in “ Holiday Inn , ” and “ Silver Bells , ” written for “ The Lemon Drop Kid . ” )
You ’ll notice that certain famous Jewish songwriters are conspicuously absent from this list .
Why ?
Unlike the Tin Pan Alley songwriters , who churned out songs to order on every conceivable subject for their publishers , writers like Jerome Kern , the Gershwins , Richard Rodgers and Harold Arlen mainly created songs for musical plays and films , and unless a story line required a holiday song they had no need to write one .
When they did try one outside the framework of a show , it rarely had the same spark .
Rodgers and Hammerstein ’s “ Happy Christmas , Little Friend , ” recorded by Rosemary Clooney in the ’50s , is sadly lethargic .
Even Clooney could n’t recall it when asked to sing it 30 years later .
Or so she claimed .
A new study of obese women who are pregnant is setting a tough new standard , instructing women to gain no weight at all during pregnancy .
As Roni Rabin reports in Tuesday ’s Science Times :
One fifth of pregnant women in the United States are obese , and more and more doctors are advising them to watch their weight if they want an easy pregnancy and smooth delivery .
In May , the Institute of Medicine issued guidelines lowering the minimum recommended weight gain for obese women to 11 pounds , from 15 .
Now , a large four - year trial called the Healthy Moms study is going further , trying to keep obese pregnant women from gaining any weight at all .

Entropy alone creates complex crystals from simple shapes , study shows
In a study that elevates the role of entropy in creating order , research led by the University of Michigan shows that certain pyramid shapes can spontaneously organize into complex quasicrystals .
A quasicrystal is a solid whose components exhibit long - range order , but without a single pattern or a unit cell that repeats .
A paper on the findings appears in the Dec. 10 issue of Nature .
Researchers from Case Western Reserve University and Kent State University collaborated on the study .
Entropy is a measure of the number of ways the components of a system can be arranged .
While often linked to disorder , entropy can also cause objects to order .
The pyramid shape central to this research is the tetrahedron --- a three - dimensional , four - faced , triangular polyhedron that turns up in nanotechnology and biology .
" Tetrahedrons are the simplest regular solids , while quasicrystals are among the most complex and beautiful structures in nature .
It 's astonishing and totally unexpected that entropy alone can produce this level of complexity , " said Sharon Glotzer , a professor in the University of Michigan departments of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering and principal investigator on the project .
The finding may lead to the development of a variety of new materials that derive properties from their structure , said Rolfe Petschek , a physics professor at Case Western Reserve who helped with the mathematical characterization of the structure .
" A quasicrystal will have different properties than a crystal or ordinary solid , " Petschek said .
The scientists used computer simulation to find the arrangement of tetrahedrons that would yield the densest packing --- that would fit the most tetrahedrons in a box .
The tetrahedron was for decades conjectured to be the only solid that packs less densely than spheres , until just last year when U - M mathematics graduate student Elizabeth Chen found an arrangement that proved that speculation wrong .
This latest study bests
Chen 's organization and discovered what is believed to be the densest achievable packing of tetrahedrons .
But Glotzer says the more significant finding is that the tetrahedrons can unexpectedly organize into intricate quasicrystals at a point in the computer simulation when they take up roughly half the space in the theoretical box .
In this computer experiment , many thousands of tetrahedrons organized into dodecagonal , or 12 - fold , quasicrystals made of parallel stacks of rings around pentagonal dipyramids .
A pentagonal dipyramid contains five tetrahedrons arranged into a disk .
The researchers discovered that this motif plays a key role in the overall packing .
This is the first result showing such a complicated self - arrangement of hard particles without help from attractive interactions such as chemical bonds , Glotzer said .
" Our results go to the very heart of phase transitions and to the question of how complex order arises in nature and in the materials we make , " Glotzer said .
" We knew that entropy on its own could produce order , but we did n't expect it to produce such intricate order .
What else might be possible just due to entropy ? "
Other approaches to solving the tetrahedron packing problem have not involved computer simulations .
Researchers instead tried out different arrangements to arrive at the densest structure .
That was the approach taken by Chen , who achieved a packing fraction of more than 77 percent , which means the shapes took up more than 77 percent of the space in the box .
( Cubes have a 100 percent packing fraction in a cubic box , while spheres pack at only 74 percent . )
Rather than " posit what they might do , " this computer simulation allowed the tetrahedrons to figure out the best packing on their own according to the laws of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , said Michael Engel , a postdoctoral researcher at U - M and co-first author of the paper with U - M chemical engineering graduate student Amir Haji -Akbari .
In the simulation , the tetrahedrons organized into a quasicrystal and settled on a packing that , when compressed further , used up 83 percent of the space .
Engel then reorganized the shapes into a " quasicrystalline approximate , " which is a periodic crystal closely resembling the quasicrystal .
He found an arrangement that filled more than 85 percent of the space .
The researchers are excited about the possible applications of the new structure .
" Made of the right materials , this unexpected new tetrahedron quasicrystal may possess unique optical properties that could be very interesting and useful , " said Peter Palffy - Muhoray , a professor in the Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University and a collaborator on the work .
Possible uses include communication and stealth technologies .

Federal records show that a contract worth $ 5.97 million , part of the $ 787 billion stimulus Congress passed this year , helped preserve three jobs at Burson - Marsteller , the global public - relations and communications firm headed by Penn .
Burson - Marsteller won the contract to work on a public - relations campaign to advertise the national switch from analog to digital television .
Nearly $ 2.8 million of the contract was awarded through a subcontract to Penn 's polling firm , Penn , Schoen & Berland , according to federal records .
Federal records also show that a former adviser to President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting '
MORE 's 2008 presidential campaign received nearly $ 70,000 from that contract to help alert viewers in difficult - to - reach communities that their televisions would ssoon no longer receive broadcast signals .
The adviser , Alfredo J. Balsera , who heads a public - affairs firm based in Coral Gables , Fla. , helped craft Obama ’s Hispanic advertising message .
Republicans on Tuesday criticized the federal spending on the advertising project as a waste of taxpayer dollars .
They noted that the advertising campaign took place on May 5 , only 39 days before the digital television transition was scheduled ( June 12 ) .

The GOP senators highlighted the direction of the stimulus funds on the same day Obama outlined a new series of proposals for creating jobs that Republicans view as another stimulus measure .
The proposals include tax cuts for small businesses , tax incentives for employers to hire new workers and infrastructure spending .
The need for additional measures has raised questions over the efficacy of the stimulus package passed earlier this year .
White House officials have said the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimated the stimulus helped to create 1.6 million jobs .
White House aides also have noted that the national employment report for November showed dramatic improvement compared to early this year .
A White House spokeswoman on Tuesday responded to the GOP report by saying Coburn ’s previous reports on stimulus spending have been filled with “ false or misleading claims . ”
“ In the end , even if there are a few unwise projects , it is only a handful out of the over 50,000 projects that have been approved to date , ” said Liz Oxhorn , a White House spokeswoman .
“ The real question here is whether Recovery Act critics will at long last acknowledge that well over 99 percent of the projects are sound , effective and working as promised . ”
McCain and Coburn did not show any indication that they knew two Democratic political strategists received funding through the grant .
A review of federal records by The Hill revealed Penn and Balsera received money from the economic stimulus program .
Burson - Marsteller , which Penn heads as CEO worldwide , won the $ 5.97 million contract through Young & Rubicam .
( Burson - Marsteller has been a part of Young & Rubicam Brands since 1979 . )
Burson - Marsteller did not respond to two requests on Tuesday to discuss its contract with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) .
On Wednesday , after news of the contract attracted widespread attention on the Internet , Burston - Marsteller issued a statement defending its work .
The firm said it spent only $ 4.36 million of the contract to complete the digital television advertising initiative .
An FCC official confirmed that number .
" Burson - Marsteller , and the approved set of vendors , including its sister company Penn Schoen & Berland LLC , successfully completed the work with the FCC on time and under budget , the company said in its statement .
" Burson - Marsteller received a total of $ 1,375,000 in professional fees to manage and support this time sensitive national and local effort with a large team of professionals .
They disbursed the rest to firms around the country in local communities , " the company said .
Burson - Marsteller said its sister company , Penn , Schoen & Berland , received only $ 142,000 in fees .
The rest was spent on a $ 2.4 million media buy that went to newspapers and local radio stations around the country and $ 147,000 spent for the services of advertising production houses , according to Burson - Marsteller .
A contract award summary posted on Recovery.gov , the government website that tracks stimulus spending , states Burson - Marsteller was awarded a competitive contract by the FCC to help prepare “ unready households for the DTV transition . ”
The purpose of the campaign was to “ bolster the reach , penetration and impact of the FCC ’s DTV readiness messages in selected markets , specifically among the groups that had been determined to be the most at risk . ”
Cassandra Andrade , a senior associate with Balsera Communications , said , “ I can see where there ’s concern , but the contract was strictly based on our merits .
We ’ve been working on multicultural outreach for many years . ”
Andrade said her firm worked to contact Hispanic television viewers in Philadelphia , Chicago and Los Angeles .
Andrade noted that according to Nielsen , a media - research company , there was a sharp decline in the number of unready homes in the week leading up to the digital transition and that 97.5 percent of households were ready for the switch .
A spokesman for Penn , Schoen & Berland did not respond to a request for comment .
Penn received scrutiny during and after the 2008 presidential campaign for the role he played in Clinton ’s unsuccessful White House bid .
Some Clinton supporters questioned whether his service was worth the millions in fees he billed to the campaign .
Penn ’s firm billed the campaign $ 5 million for polling and at least $ 8 million for sending out direct - mail pieces , according to Time magazine .
Clinton ’s campaign still owes Penn , Schoen & Berland $ 995,500 , according to Federal Election Commission records .
Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) said the three jobs saved at Burson - Marsteller represented a poor value for taxpayers .
“ It illustrates a very poor way to create jobs , ” Kyl said .
Kyl said the appropriateness of Democratic strategists receiving funds “ depends on whether they exerted some influence . ”
The digital television advertising campaign ranked as No. 3 on the list of 100 projects that GOP senators on Tuesday highlighted as “ pure waste ” in the billions of stimulus funds spent this year .
At the top of the GOP list is a $ 5 million grant from the Department of Energy to create a geothermal energy system for the Oak Ridge City Center shopping mall in Oak Ridge , Tenn .
The main problem with the project , say Republicans , is the fact the mall has been losing tenants for years and is mostly empty .
GOP senators also blasted a $ 1.57 million grant to Penn State University to search for fossils in Argentina and a $ 100,000 award to a liberal - leaning theater in Minnesota for socially conscious puppet shows .
Two million dollars in stimulus money went to build a replica railroad as a tourist attraction in Carson City , Nev .
A dinner cruise company based in Chicago received nearly $ 1 million in funds to combat terrorism .
Half a million dollars went to Arizona State University to study the genetic makeup of ants to determine distinctive roles in ant colonies ; $ 450,000 went to the University of Arizona to study the division of labor in ant colonies .
The State University of New York at Buffalo won $ 390,000 to study young adults who drink malt liquor and smoke marijuana .
The National Institutes of Health got $ 219,000 in funds to study whether female college students are more likely to “ hook up ” after drinking alcohol .
The University of Hawaii collected $ 210,000 to study the learning patterns of honeybees , and $ 700,000 went to help crab fishermen in Oregon recover lost crab pots .
This article was updated on 8:17 p.m .
Update : The Hill initially reported on the basis of federal records that nearly $ 6 million in stimulus money was paid to Burson - Marsteller and Penn , Schoen & Berland Associates .
Burson - Marsteller received a federal contract worth $ 5.97 million .
As part of that contract , Penn , Schoen & Berland received a subcontract worth more than $ 2.7 million .
A spokesman for Burson - Marsteller said only $ 4.36 million from the contract is scheduled to be paid out .
Burson - Marsteller declined to respond to a request Tuesday to explain the details of its contract .
The Hill also reported that Hillary Clinton paid off her debt to Penn 's firm in July .
She still owes Penn 's firm $ 995,500 , according to an October fundraising report .
CLARIFICATION : The Hill reported Dec. 9 on stimulus funds paid to firms run by Mark Penn to finance a government promotional campaign .
A headline could have been clearer that the money went to the Fortune 500 company that employs him ( as well as to media buys ) , and not to Penn himself .
US on the Road to Ruin , Time to Protect Your Assets
“ It ’s time for another surreality check , but this time it is n’t the publicly traded companies that deserve attention , it ’s the governments that have saved them , ” write Eric Sprott and David Franklin in a scathing assessment of the walking - dead US government .
They continue , “ make no mistake – the dead men are still walking – they ’re just a lot bigger now than they were two years ago , and they do n’t generate earnings – they print money and tax their citizens . ”
Simply put , the problem is that “ the United States Government is on a trajectory to default on their obligations .
In its current financial condition , it will not be able to fund its forecasted budget deficits and unfunded Social Security and Medicare promises on top of its current debt obligations . ”
The way they explain it , it ’s impossible to know exactly when the market will integrate this cold calculation , but the time is coming .
It then follows that , “ there simply is n’t enough taxing power , value creation or outside capital willing to support its egregious spending . ”
The spending Sprott and Franklin refer to amounts to a roughly $ 9 trillion deficit by 2019 , and there ’s no straightforward way to fill that gap .
As they explain , “ how on earth does anyone expect them to raise this capital ? … all existing investors would have had to increase their US bond purchases by 200 % in fiscal 2009 .
Foreigners , however , only increased their purchases by a mere 28 % from September 2008 to July 2009 – far short of what the US government required . ”
The advantage for dear readers comes in understanding this ongoing macroeconomic trend and protecting your own assets accordingly .
As they describe , the “ bottom line is that there is serious cause for concern here — and do n’t be fooled into thinking this crisis will fix itself when ( and if ) the economy recovers . ”
Policymakers have lost long term perspective and have put “ the US on the road to ruin , and the major governments of the world have noticed and are taking action . ”
In its entirety , the 5 - page Sprott Asset Management document topics range from closing Social Security to new entrants to limiting Medicare with vouchers as it provides an eye - opening surreality check of a dead government walking .
Mammalodon probably lived by sucking small animals up from the seafloor
An ancient " dwarf " whale appears to have fed by sucking small animals out of the seafloor mud with its short snout and tongue , experts say .
Researchers say the 25 million - year - old fossil is related to today 's blue whales - the largest animals on Earth .
The ancient animal 's mud slurping may have been a precursor to the filter feeding seen in modern baleen whales .
These whales strain huge quantities of tiny marine animals through specialised " combs " which take the place of teeth .
The research is published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society .
The fossilised remains of the primitive baleen whale Mammalodon colliveri were discovered near Torquay , in Victoria , Australia .
Clearly the seas off southern Australia were a cradle for the evolution of a variety of tiny , weird whales that seem to have lived nowhere else
Dr Erich Fitzgerald , Museum Victoria
This animal still had teeth ; it had not yet evolved the baleen plates - used for filter - feeding - which characterise present - day baleen whales .
Although Mammalodon was discovered in 1932 and named in 1939 , it has not been widely studied , according to Museum Victoria , which holds specimens of this group .
The study 's author , Dr Erich Fitzgerald from Museum Victoria , said that his study of the fossil led him to the conclusion that Mammalodon was a bottom - feeding mud-sucker .
Splinter group
The idea would support Charles Darwin 's observation about whale evolution in his seminal book On the Origin of Species .
In it , Darwin speculated that some of the earliest baleen whales may have been suction feeders - and that this served as a precursor to the filter feeding of today 's giants of the deep .
Mammalodon probably evolved from much bigger ancestors Mammalodon had a total body length of about 3 m .
But it appears to have been a bizarre evolutionary " splinter group " from the evolutionary lineage which later led to the 30 m - long blue whale .
It was effectively a dwarf whale ; the research suggests that Mammalodon may have evolved into a relatively tiny form from larger ancestors .
Mammalodon belongs to the same family as Janjucetus hunderi , fossils of which were also found in 25 million - year - old Oligocene rocks near Torquay in Victoria .
This family appears to be unique to south - east Australia .
" Clearly the seas off southern Australia were a cradle for the evolution of a variety of tiny , weird whales that seem to have lived nowhere else , " said Dr Fitzgerald .
The baleen plates which allow today 's baleen whales to filter their food from water , distinguish this group from the toothed whales - a group which includes beaked whales and dolphins .
Baleen whales are a taxonomical group which includes not only the majestic blue whale , but also the right whales , fin whales and humpbacks , to name but a few .

The Stress Factor - 3 secrets to increasing your stress “ resistance ” Guest articles >
The Stress Factor - 3 secrets to increasing your stress “ resistance ” by : John Fillingham Nearly 20 years ago I discovered a cure for stress and I can confidently say my life has never been the same since .
I revived the techniques I was taught all those years ago recently , after combining them with some back exercises a therapist taught me after a particular nasty back wrenching tennis match some months ago .
I still hold dear the theory that the world ( and therefore people ’s lives ) would be a much better place if we learned to control our stress levels .
I had almost forgotten what it was like to be “ cool as a cucumber ” calm again , for a sustained period .
For some people I know this could be quite a scary concept , they do n’t feel alive if adrenalin is n’t racing through their body or there is n’t some crisis of immense proportions that needs their most urgent attention .
Is that a feeling of wanting to be needed – I wonder .
The demands of the modern world takes its toll on every aspect of our lives , from the lifestyle we must maintain to the hours at work we must put in to sustain it .
Simply being alive can be a very challenging activity , is it easy then to overcome the toils and pains of life to live a trouble free existence ?
Living a trouble free life and controlling your stress are two very different things .
If you are expecting an easy ride , hoping to miss all the things that “ should n’t happen to me ” then you would probably need to reset the model of your world you have created .
Being “ stress resistant ” is what I prefer to call handling your stress well .
Avoiding the irrational , thump , thump , thump of your heart racing when you hear the news that something is n’t right in your world takes effort , time and practice .
It does n’t change over night , but as they say , every journey begins with the first step .
For anyone who has an emotional thermometer that feels sometimes more like a roller coaster , then you may share many of the feelings and experiences in this short article .
For those of you more in control of yourselves , well done I say , lucky you .
However , we all at times get a little hot under the collar when put in awkward situations , when 299 things land in our lap and suddenly we are expected to hit them all running .
So the bottom line is , we could all do with a bit of stress control practice , even though for some of us it ’s more of a necessity rather than a luxury .
Let me start at a general level and work downwards , as best I can in this format .
My first instruction is go visit a doctor and get expert medical advice before doing anything , for those of your do n’t think you have the time or feel it ’s unnecessary , please make the effort , it ’s worth getting yourself checked before you do anything and get yourself an MOT !
My 3 secrets to increasing your stress resistance – Develop a positive attitude , practice breathing exercises and muscle control .
Breathing is of course at the centre of it all , because it has an instantaneous impact on your heart rate , therefore on your stress level , the 2 are very closely connected .
So if you want to quickly calm yourself down at any time , concentrate on your breathing and slow it down , taking long , slow deep breaths .
It ’s a great tip for those tense situations such as giving talks and presentations or asking your boss for a pay rise .
So let ’s begin with attitude , action is better than words as they say , indeed it is much better than “ thinking ” as often faulty thinking is a major root cause of stress .
This is what I call “ stress thinking ” as opposed to “ productive thinking ” – remember those times when you ’ve worked yourself up into a fury about something or worried about something so much , when it finally came to it , it was actually nothing like you expected – this is stress thinking in action .
So you have to stop thinking so much and get on and do something .
Anything ( well almost ) , but do something ( positive ) .
In life , a positive attitude can make a huge difference because you have to have the belief that you can make it better .
This goes a long way in quickly switching your thinking from stress thinking to productive thinking .
If you are n’t already a positive thinker by nature , then it will take some work but starting from a positive point of view may influence the outcomes of the situations you apply it to .
If you can think of 1 million reasons why not , I can think of 1 million reasons why …. so tip it in favour of the positive , it ’s a choice , so choose it and notice the difference .
When you smile , you relax , try it , it works .
I smile a lot .
It often takes the heat out of situations and gives you another , often different perspective .
Stress is often defined by the position / perspective you take , it seems like you ’ve lost control , its out of your hands and you cant ’ do anything about it , so much is going on and you ca n’t stop the giant rock rolling down the hill .
You can nudge the rock though and bounce if off in a different direction .
Tackle one thing at a time , prioritise , so what really needs your energy , where do you put it , you simply ca n’t spread it too thin and expect to stay in once piece !
Think of your brain as being like your laptop , too many programmes running , it slows down , ask it to do too much and the thing crashes and locks .
Your mind is the like the memory of the computer , try to overload it and it ca n’t cope .
Therefore important things I write down and put into my personal organiser and calendar for action , the rest I politely forget , I refuse to keep them in my short term memory , if they are really important to me , they will automatically go into long term memory .
Breath control – in my exercise routine everyday , I build in some breathing exercises .
I take deep breaths , holding them for a few seconds and then let go .
For most of us who are office or desk bound , our sitting position does not promote healthy full lung breathing .
The muscle ( the diaphragm ) that controls our lungs is compressed when sitting down , therefore we spend most of our time taking shallow breaths , starving our bodies of the oxygen it needs to live fully and provide us with maximum energy .
I used to do a full 20/30 minutes worth of these exercises , mixing it in with my gym workouts , I believe it ’s really worth it .
The greatest benefit comes from lowering the heart rate and making you feel relaxed – it ’s a key cure for stress .
Muscle control – one of the key things I learned all that time ago , is that stress usually manifests itself in a physical way , headaches , stomach ache and so on and they clearly show you that you are in a “ stressed ” state of mind .
A technique for change is to do something physical to change your mental state .
Working on the different muscle groups in the body , from head to toe , tensing and relaxing the muscles with physical movements is one way , stretching and exercising another .
For me the essential ingredient in finding suitable cures for stress ( and they can take different forms for every person – music is often a “ mood changer ” and therefore a stress cure for me ) is the “ me time ” element .
Dedicating some time , purely and selfishly just for you – even if it is only for 10 or 15 minutes a day is absolutely , the most important fundamental element in saving your sanity and relieving your stress .

The big update in all the Tiger Woods news is that , not only was he sleeping with whoever he could pick up in clubs , but he was paying for prostitutes as well , sometimes two at a time .
This according to Michelle Braun , who ran a call girl ring for 15 years , up until 2007 .
The New York Daily News says …
Braun revealed ( that Woods ) was particularly smitten by a gorgeous Playboy model from Long Island named Loredana Jolie .
“ He went out with her four or five times .
She took part in group sex .
They met up in 2006 or early 2007 .
I ’d say he paid $ 15,000 for her . ”
And E !
Online says it was Braun who arranged for Woods to meet Holly Sampson and Jamie Jungers , though Jungers appeared on the Today show this morning and denied this .
Two of those former employees , Braun claims , were porn actress Holly Sampson and onetime Trashy Lingerie model Jamie Jungers .
With all this mind , I put on my detective cap and went searching for more information about Holly Sampson : Professional Slut .
Unfortunately my investigation quickly led to a bunch of porn sites and within 9 minutes I had masturbated and was taking a nap .
But then by random coincidence , one of the sexy readers emailed me exactly what I was looking for : Holly Sampsons rate sheet and contact info , with reviews by total strangers who fukced her , thankfully included .
You can see 2 of her full size NSFW ads here and here .
Her profile page says she charges $ 600 per hour , and for that you can get a blowjob with no condom and finish on her as often as time and your refractory period will allow .
She says she has long straight bleached hair and D cup breasts , but she ’s not sure if she has any tattoos or piercings .
There are six pages of reviews , so maybe one of those guys will know if she has any .
She generally gets good marks , but The Wiz ends his with a poignant reminder .
We got into bed and she started bbbj that was skillful and wet .
I then tasted every inch of this beautiful woman and I can tell you that she tasted damn good .
She put a cover on me and we went at it with mish , CG , RCG , spoon , doggy and finished with her lying on her stomach and me on top .
We both cleaned up and talked for a while .
I told her how beautiful she was and went down on her again and she allowed for a second round .
We had more DFK , DATY , and BBBJ before I popped again .
I did not CIM but she stroked me slowly at the end and squeezed just right for it to feel perfect .
I had a fun time with Holly and would repeat .
Treat her like a lady and she will show you a great time .
Ahh yes .
Well said my friend .
Valmont also reminds us that just because a woman takes 600 dollars to have sex with a total stranger does n’t mean she stops being a lady .
Holly is a beautiful woman inside and out we talked and had champane and strawberys to get to know each other a bit .
moving to the bed I gave her a massage kissing her back down to her butt turning her over on to daty very sweet and tasty .
brough her to a strong O then her turn bbbj then the cover entered her mish then doggie until both of had strong O ’s laid there cuddling until round two began .
She stayed well over the 2 hours .
will repeat next time in LA .
NOT TO BE MISSED .
BE gentle with her she will respond .
McDuff apparently did n’t know about this strawberries and champagne , cat and mouse game that you ’re supposed to play with prostitutes .
We got to the room and continued our conversation …
In my opinion , it went on too long .
I learned more about Holly than I wanted to know .
Anyway , we eventually ended up naked and in bed .
She has a great body and I enjoyed every bit of it .
Great tits , sweet tasting pussy , bbbj , interrupted by her conversation about something – I was n’t listening – and then doggy , finishing on what I consider to be one of the finest asses I have ever seen .
She cleaned up , came back and we talked some more – I finally put her hand on my dick and wee started round two , ending in mish and finishing on her very attractive boobs .
No GFE , but a very hot session when it was just sex .
Of all the reviews , only Mayfield seemed disappointed in his selection of STD delivery system .
Black soot deposited on Tibetan glaciers has contributed significantly to the retreat of the world 's largest non-polar ice masses , according to new research by scientists from NASA and the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
Soot absorbs incoming solar radiation and can speed glacial melting when deposited on snow in sufficient quantities .
Temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau -- sometimes called Earth 's " third pole " -- have warmed by 0.3 °C ( 0.5 °F ) per decade over the past 30 years , about twice the rate of observed global temperature increases .
New field research and ongoing quantitative modeling suggests that soot 's warming influence on Tibetan glaciers could rival that of greenhouse gases .
" Tibet 's glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate , " said James Hansen , coauthor of the study and director of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) in New York City .
" Black soot is probably responsible for as much as half of the glacial melt , and greenhouse gases are responsible for the rest . "
" During the last 20 years , the black soot concentration has increased two - to three - fold relative to its concentration in 1975 , " said Junji Cao , a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and a coauthor of the paper .
The study was published December 7th in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Fifty percent of the glaciers were retreating from 1950 to 1980 in the Tibetan region ; that rose to 95 percent in the early 21st century , " said Tandong Yao , director of the Chinese Academy 's Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research .
Some glaciers are retreating so quickly that they could disappear by mid-century if current trends continue , the researchers suggest .

Since melt water from Tibetan glaciers replenishes many of Asia 's major rivers -- including the Indus , Ganges , Yellow , and Brahmaputra -- such losses could have a profound impact on the billion people who rely on the rivers for fresh water .
While rain and snow would still help replenish Asian rivers in the absence of glaciers , the change could hamper efforts to manage seasonal water resources by altering when fresh water supplies are available in areas already prone to water shortages .
Researchers led by Baiqing Xu of the Chinese Academy drilled and analyzed five ice cores from various locations across the Tibetan Plateau , looking for black carbon ( a key component of soot ) as well as organic carbon .
The cores support the hypothesis that black soot amounts in the Himalayan glaciers correlate with black carbon emissions in Europe and South Asia .
At Zuoqiupu glacier -- a bellwether site on the southern edge of the plateau and downwind from the Indian subcontinent -- black soot deposition increased by 30 percent between 1990 and 2003 .
The rise in soot levels at Zuoqiupu follows a dip that followed the enacting of clean air regulations in Europe in the 1970s .
Most soot in the region comes from diesel engines , coal - fired power plants , and outdoor cooking stoves .
Many industrial processes produce both black carbon and organic carbon , but often in different proportions .
Burning diesel fuel produces mainly black carbon , for example , while burning wood produces mainly organic carbon .
Since black carbon is darker and absorbs more radiation , it 's thought to have a stronger warming effect than organic carbon .
To refine this emerging understanding of soot 's impact on glaciers , scientists are striving to gather even more robust measurements .
" We can't expect this study to clarify the effect of black soot on the melting of Tibetan snow and glaciers entirely , " said Cao .
" Additional work that looks at albedo measurements , melting rate , and other types of reconnaissance is also needed . "
For example , scientists are using satellite instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) aboard the NASA satellites Terra and Aqua to enhance understanding of the region 's albedo .
And a new NASA climate satellite called Glory , which will launch late in 2010 , will carry a new type of aerosol sensor that should be able to distinguish between aerosol types more accurately than previous instruments .
" Reduced black soot emissions , in addition to reduced greenhouse gases , may be required to avoid demise of Himalayan glaciers and retain the benefits of glaciers for seasonal fresh water supplies , " Hansen said .
In New Jersey , governor - elect Christie opposes ( and rightfully so ) , the state going deeper in debt but that is not stopping the current administration of Jon Corzine .
Please consider N.J. to Borrow $ 200 Million Amid Incoming Governor ’s Opposition .
New Jersey , the third - most indebted U.S. state , will sell more than $ 200 million in bonds today to finance voter - approved capital projects a week after Governor - elect Christopher Christie said he opposed borrowing more money .
The state will issue $ 209.1 million of bonds , including $ 205 million of tax - exempt securities , the largest such competitively bid offering in the market today , according to Bloomberg data .
Christie , a Republican who defeated Democratic incumbent Jon Corzine last month , said he opposed new bond sales after the state last week detailed $ 2.7 billion in borrowing it plans for the remainder of the fiscal year , which ends in June .
The state ’s bond sale today will finance clean water and open - space preservation projects , according to a preliminary official statement .
The state is also planning to sell $ 1.4 billion of bonds for transportation and $ 1.1 billion for school construction before June 30 , according to a Nov. 30 report .
Christie , 47 , a former U.S. attorney , told Bloomberg News last week that New Jersey “ ca n’t have any more debt ” and that any projections for borrowing will be “ rendered meaningless ” when he takes office on Jan. 19 .
New Jersey has $ 36.5 billion of gross tax - supported debt , the third highest of the 50 states , according to a report released in July by Moody ’s Investors Service .
Moody ’s rates the state ’s bonds Aa3 , the fourth highest ranking .
California has the most , at $ 75.2 billion .
New York City is leading the municipal market this week as issuers seek to borrow more than $ 10 billion , according to Bloomberg data .
New York , the largest borrower among U.S. cities , is selling $ 1.4 billion of taxable and tax - exempt securities , including $ 616 million of Build America Bonds .
By yesterday , the city had taken orders from individual investors for $ 440 million of the tax - exempt bonds , and for $ 20 million in Build America Bonds that it expects to finish pricing on Dec. 10 , according to Ray Orlando , a spokesman for the city Office of Management and Budget .
Yields on conventional 20 - year municipal debt fell to an eight - week low of 4.24 percent , down 1.34 percentage points from a year ago , according to a weekly Bond Buyer index .

Maybe I ’m naïve , but I ’m feeling optimistic about the climate talks starting in Copenhagen on Monday .
President Obama now plans to address the conference on its last day , which suggests that the White House expects real progress .
It ’s also encouraging to see developing countries  including China , the world ’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide  agreeing , at least in principle , that they need to be part of the solution .
Of course , if things go well in Copenhagen , the usual suspects will go wild .
We ’ll hear cries that the whole notion of global warming is a hoax perpetrated by a vast scientific conspiracy , as demonstrated by stolen e-mail messages that show  well , actually all they show is that scientists are human , but never mind .
We ’ll also , however , hear cries that climate - change policies will destroy jobs and growth .
The truth , however , is that cutting greenhouse gas emissions is affordable as well as essential .
Serious studies say that we can achieve sharp reductions in emissions with only a small impact on the economy ’s growth .
And the depressed economy is no reason to wait  on the contrary , an agreement in Copenhagen would probably help the economy recover .
Why should you believe that cutting emissions is affordable ?
First , because financial incentives work .
If you think the stress you experience during the holidays is doing you harm , you 're right .
Scientists from the University of Connecticut and Yale University say that entertaining your in - laws or traveling long distances this time of year can make you sick , and they they know why .
According to their study published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology , the same part of our nervous system that is responsible for the fight - or - flight response ( called the sympathetic nervous system ) also controls regulatory T cells , which are used by the body to end an immune response once a foreign invader has been removed or destroyed .
To make this discovery , the research team injected mice with a drug called 6 - hyroxydopamine ( 6 - OHDA ) that selectively removes sympathetic nerves located in different organs , or a saline solution .
Mice injected with 6 - OHDA , which effectively severed the link between the nervous system and the immune system had twice as many regulatory T cells as the control group in their spleens and lymph nodes .
Further analysis showed that the increase in regulatory T cells resulted from an increase in a protein called " TGF - beta , " which directs the development and survival of regulatory T cells .
With this information in hand , the researchers sought to see if 6 - OHDA would prevent autoimmune disorders from developing .
To do this , they injected 6 - OHDA or a saline solution into mice before subjecting them and a control group to conditions known to cause an autoimmune disease similar to multiple sclerosis in humans .
Unlike the control group , the mice treated with 6 - OHDA did not develop the autoimmune disease , showing that not only can the sympathetic nervous system negatively affect the immune system , but it also shows how it might be possible to prevent or stop autoimmune disorders .
" Ever since Hans Seyle 's groundbreaking work on stress , scientists have been trying to understand why stressful situations often exacerbate autoimmune diseases and cause re-emergence of latent infections , " said John Wherry , Ph.D. , Deputy Editor of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology .
" In true fight or flight situations , stress can be a lifesaver , but understanding how the neurological response to the stress of everyday events such as seeing your family around the holidays impacts immune responses should provide opportunities for new therapies . " :

Some 8,000 people disappeared during the 20 - year conflict A human rights group says it has discovered more unmarked graves in Indian - administered Kashmir .
The International People 's Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice says there are 2,700 graves with nearly 3,000 bodies .
Some of the mass graves contain between three and 17 bodies .
Last year too , the group had found 1,000 unmarked graves in the Muslim - majority Kashmir valley .
The Indian army and militants have been accused of numerous human rights abuses in Kashmir over the past two decades .
More than a dozen separatist Islamic groups have been fighting Indian administration .
' Civilians killed '
In a recent report , the tribunal said most of the graves were found in three northern districts of Baramullah , Kupwara and Bandipora .
The report said the group examined the cases of 50 people whom the Indian authorities described as foreign militants who had been killed in fighting with Indian security forces .
Investigations revealed that 47 of them were ordinary civilians killed in false encounters , it said .
" We are not saying we have evidence of who is in each grave .
What we are saying is we do n't know , " said Dr Angana Chatterjee , convener of the group .
" Fifty of them were identified and recorded as foreign militants .
Forty seven were civilians .
So if you look at a sample and the sample gives you an evidentiary understanding , so you can make an assumption about the other graves . "
Dr Chatterjee said the graves might be containing the bodies of the 8,000 people who disappeared during 20 years of the armed conflict .
She said the police should publish the photographs of the people buried in the graves to help families of the disappeared people to check whether their relatives were among them .
Dr Chatterjee said the " new " graveyards were found next to fields , schools and homes , largely on community land .

In this lonely corner of the world , the first sign of distress is the luggage .
When one of the few international flights that are still operating here touched down one recent afternoon , the returning passengers emerged from baggage claim as if from a big shopping trip .
Old metal trolleys squealed under the weight of mundane items : tires , a laptop computer , tubs of detergent and duffel bags crammed so tightly with food that tin cans bulged through the fabric .
The needs are acute in Eritrea , a narrow shard of sand and rock along the Red Sea that 's presided over by one of Africa 's most secretive regimes .
As its quixotic experiment in economic self - reliance falters , the Ohio - sized country of 5 million has slipped into its deepest political isolation in its 16 years of independence .
The United States and others accuse President Isaias Afwerki of funneling arms and money to Islamist insurgents in Somalia and have threatened to slap him with sanctions .
Analysts say Isaias is bent on wresting influence from Ethiopia — Eritrea 's large southern neighbor and adversary in a 30 - year liberation struggle — and is backing several rebel groups across the chaotic Horn of Africa .
Who needs allies ?
In a rare interview , Isaias dismissed the allegations as " fabrications " by Western interests — including his favorite bogeyman , the CIA — that traditionally have sided with Ethiopia .
The pariah label has reinforced his belligerent attitude toward a world that long ignored Eritrea 's cries for independence , and one in which he now seems to have just one remaining friend , the wealthy Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar .
" Why would you want to have allies ? " the 63 - year - old president told McClatchy .
" It 's a sign of weakness . "
A gruff , imposingly tall former guerrilla with a college professor 's wardrobe and a Ron Burgundy moustache , Isaias helped lead the liberation war and has never let go of power .
A decade after a devastating border flare - up with Ethiopia that remains unresolved , he 's never held elections , banned opposition groups and independent media , and reportedly banished thousands of people to remote desert prisons where they languish without trial in " harsh and life - threatening conditions , " according to a State Department human rights report last year .
In recent years , Isaias has seized U.N. World Food Program stockpiles and expelled or blocked most international relief organizations , claiming that his arid nation could produce enough food to feed all its people .
Yet after consecutive poor harvests , and amid one of the worst hunger crises in East Africa in decades , the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization warned last month that as many as two - thirds of Eritreans may be malnourished .
Isaias rejected the report — " We have no shortage , " he said — but humanitarian groups say the government blocks them from accessing the areas that are thought to be the most affected .
In the capital , Asmara , more and more children in frayed clothes and splotchy skin are begging on the streets , hinting at desperation in the countryside .
" A year or two ago , you never saw that , " a diplomat said .
" It means the safety net is failing . "
Indefinite military service
Perched atop a 7,600 - foot plateau , sun-bathed Asmara is one of the continent 's safest and most alluring capitals , with wide , palm - fringed streets and splashes of colorful modernist architecture left over from Italian colonial rule .
Below the surface , however , beats constant fear .
No Eritreans would be quoted by name criticizing the president .
The government , which some have likened to an African North Korea , controls people 's lives through a program of forced national service that requires all citizens to undergo military training and then assigns them indefinitely to army posts or civilian jobs , paying token wages .
Men and women younger than 50 rarely get permission to leave the country , effectively meaning that the entire able - bodied population is on reserve duty .
People who resist the service routinely are imprisoned and tortured , as documented in a 96 - page report this year by Human Rights Watch , which found that Eritrean authorities had issued shoot - to - kill orders for anyone caught trying to jump the border without permission .
" It 's for generations that we 're trying to build a nation and build an economy , and that requires sacrifice , " Isaias said .
" National service may not be liked by everybody , even by the government , but it 's a necessity . "
Surviving on remittances
Yet even with these draconian measures , the country remains far from self - reliant .
One - third of the economy , according to some estimates , consists of money sent home by Eritreans living overseas .
The prodigious shopping on display at the airport — all carried by elderly travelers , the only ones eligible for exit visas — also suggests that Isaias ' gambit is failing .
" People are losing patience every day , " said a 44 - year - old father of three who spent 12 years in the national service , including a stint as a soldier on the front lines during the 1998 - 2000 border war , when a bullet hit him in the back .
His conscript 's salary was about $ 35 a month , and although the government provided small rations of goods such as coffee , sugar and cooking oil , he had to moonlight .
Isaias " always talks about sacrifice , sacrifice , " the man said at a sidewalk cafe , lowering his voice when a waitress came near .
" People are looking around and asking , ' What 's the purpose ? ' "
It was n't always so bleak .
Following independence , Isaias pledged to institute multiparty democracy , and he oversaw the drafting of a progressive constitution .
When the border dispute reignited , however , Isaias dramatically scaled up conscription and put all pretenses of democracy on hold .
When he was asked when he 'll hold elections , Isaias said , " We do n't need elections . "
More of the nation 's youth seem to be abandoning hope .
Despite the perils of fleeing , the United Nations refugee agency received 62,700 new asylum applications from Eritreans last year ; only Zimbabwe produced more .
The bulk of the asylum - seekers , according to diplomats and independent human rights reports , are young army deserters and high - schoolers evading military training at Sawa , a prisonlike desert camp .
Last May , the State Department reported , several apparent deserters were shot near the border with Djibouti .
" The defections have to be a concern for the regime , " said Dan Connell , a lecturer at Simmons College in Boston who 's written extensively on Eritrea .
" One reason they instituted national service was to initiate the next generation into the culture of the liberation movement .
The evidence suggests it 's not working . "
One afternoon in a dimly lit bar , a 25 - year - old man nursed a beer and recalled a friend from his military service days who was arrested for saying critical things about the government .
He was hauled off to prison and has n't been heard from since .
That was three years ago .
The man sighed and contemplated his own chances of escaping , perhaps to the United States .
" What 's the best that anyone could hope for here ? " he said .
" It 's not very much . "

Independents could undermine support for an ambitious Democratic agenda and imperil the party 's 2010 prospects .
Dems alarmed as independents bolt
Mounting evidence that independent voters have soured on the Democrats is prompting a debate among party officials about what rhetorical and substantive changes are needed to halt the damage .
Following serious setbacks with independents in off - year elections earlier this month , White House officials attributed the defeats to local factors and said President Barack Obama sees no need to reposition his own image or the Democratic message .

Since then , however , a flurry of new polls makes clear that Democrats are facing deeper problems with independents — the swing voters who swung dramatically toward the party in 2006 and 2008 but who now are registering deep unease with the amount of spending and debt called for under Obama 's agenda in an era of one - party rule in Washington .
A Gallup Poll released last week offered a disturbing glimpse about the state of play : just 14 percent of independents approve of the job Congress is doing , the lowest figure all year .
In just the past few days alone , surveys have shown Democratic incumbents trailing Republicans among independent voters by double - digit margins in competitive statewide contests in places as varied as Connecticut , Ohio and Iowa .
Obama ’s own popularity among independents has fallen significantly , too .
A CBS News poll Tuesday showed the president ’s approval rating among unaligned voters falling to 45 percent — down from 63 percent in April .
“ We withdrew from the accounts of voters and now we need to pay them back , ” said Nathan Daschle , executive director of the Democratic Governors Association .
“ We are having these conversations right now about what independents need to see and hear . ”
Pat Waak , the chairwoman of the Colorado Democratic Party , said the party had so far failed to convince independent voters of the steps it had taken to improve the economy .
“ I think the economy is at the base of the tension , ” she said .
“ Quite frankly , we ’ve got to do a better job of messaging .
There ’s a lot of work to be done to get independents more comfortable with what we ’re doing . ”
“ Listen , it has n’t been an easy time , ” said T.J. Rooney , a former state legislator and the chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party .
“ It ’s almost like we ’re a victim of our own success .
When you ’re governing , that changes the political dynamic . ”
Andrew Myers , who polled for Democrats in Virginia House of Delegates races this year , said his analysis of exit polls indicated that voters had come to see Democrats as a party of high spending — too willing to make a rush for the pocketbooks and unable to effectively articulate how their health care reform push benefited independents , many of whom already have insurance plans .
“ This is what ’s particularly heartbreaking :
There is a real sense that no one in Congress is standing up for them , ” said Myers .
“ It ’s a real problem for messaging for us . ”
Nowhere was that more obvious than in Virginia and New Jersey , where GOP candidates captured governorships on Nov. 3 on the strength of landslide margins among independent voters .
In Virginia , Republican Bob McDonnell won a 65 percent to 34 percent victory over Democrat Creigh Deeds among independents in a state where President Barack Obama split the independent vote 49 percent to 48 percent against Republican John McCain just one year earlier .
In New Jersey , Republican Chris Christie won a 58 percent to 31 percent victory over Democratic incumbent Jon Corzine among independents — a stark contrast to Obama ’s 51 percent to 47 percent win among independents in 2008 .
“ The perception of what ’s happening in Congress is polluting what ’s happening down below , ” Myers said .
Michael Dimock , a pollster for the Pew Research Center — which reported in a new survey that only 45 percent of independents want their own representative to return to Congress — also believes Democrats have suffered for their inability to move the ball on key agenda items such as health care .
“ I think it ’s about action and not about words right now .
The public wants to see action , ” said Dimock .
“ I ’m not sure words are going to help Democrats at this point .
They ’ve got to achieve some successes . ”
“ Independents are typically more frustrated with the political process , ” noted Dimock .
“ They tend to have a real distaste for partisanship and ideology , and that ’s about all they ’re hearing right now . ”
Some strategists , however , attribute the party ’s weak Election Day showing among independent voters to changes in the composition of the independents who showed up at the polls .
“ What we saw are more independents who are like Republicans and fewer independents who are like Democrats , ” said Brad Lawrence , a veteran Democratic media consultant in New Jersey who worked for Corzine .
“ I think there was an enthusiasm gap . ”
“ This was not the same group of independents who showed up in 2008 , ” noted Larry Sabato , a University of Virginia political scientist .
“ For Obama ’s election , the participating independents were more moderate ; for Christie and McDonnell , the composition of the independents that came to the polls was more conservative .
It ’s this self - selection among the independent voter pool that helped the Democrats in 2008 and hurt them in 2009 . ”
Democrats also argue that with polls showing fewer voters identifying themselves as Republicans , the pool of independent voters is simply becoming more conservative than in the past , as those formerly Republican voters move into that camp .
An October Washington Post / ABC
News survey , for example , found just 20 percent of those polled identifying themselves as Republican .
“ It looks a lot worse than it really is , ” said John Anzalone , a veteran Democratic pollster .
“ Independents are n’t just falling away from Democrats . ”
Still , Anzalone cautioned that with the party ’s agenda under fire from Republicans and allied conservative groups , Democrats in conservative Southern and Western states need to be aware of the potential peril in alienating independent voters .
An automated survey released Monday by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling underscored that message with its finding that Democratic Rep. Vic Snyder , a seven - term Arkansas congressman , was only narrowly leading his little - known Republican challengers and held just a 30 percent approval rating among independents .
The erosion among independents , however , is n’t simply a regional problem .
Democrats are anxious about the prospects of five - term Sen.
Chris Dodd in Connecticut , who trails one of his GOP opponents by 28 percentage points among independents in a prospective head - to - head matchup , and Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter and Iowa Gov. Chet Culver , two Democratic incumbents with shrinking approval ratings among independent voters .
A Des Moines Register poll released this weekend showed the first - term Culver trailing the GOP front - runner among independents by nearly 30 percentage points .
“ It ’s a challenge , ” said Chris Redfern , the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party , referring to the current election environment .
But , he added , “ we do n’t need all of them back .
We just need a majority . ”
Sen . Robert Menendez , the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , acknowledged that the recent polls constituted “ red flags ” for Democrats .
But he said voters remained unsatisfied with a Republican Party that , he said , had yet to demonstrate an ability to prove it has answers to the problems facing the country .
“ I take this data with a grain of salt , ” Menendez told POLITICO .
“ At this moment in time , we may not be doing as well with independents as I ’d like , but Republicans are n’t doing well , either . ”

Zappos for Good Initiatives
SAN FRANCISCO  Google is in discussions to buy Yelp , the Web site that lists and reviews local businesses , according to three people who had been briefed on the negotiations .
The talks show how intently the biggest Web companies are setting their sights on the smallest neighborhood businesses , where they see a large and untapped group of advertisers .
Google and Yelp have not signed an agreement , the people said .
The people would not disclose the proposed price , but one said it was more than $ 500 million .
Google and Yelp declined to comment .
“ It ’s the strongest testament that Google really wants to own this local market , not vicariously but directly , ” said Greg Sterling , the founder of Sterling Market Intelligence , a San Francisco company that researches on local businesses and the Internet .
Web companies big and small are trying to give people information about restaurants , news and events within a few blocks or miles of where they are .
Yelp dominates the market for local business listings and reviews in big cities .

Year 1996
Unlike the Communist Party in other post -Communist states like Poland and Hungary , which transformed themselves after 1989 into more mainstream center - left parties , the Czech Communist Party has studiously avoided a comprehensive overhaul .
Indeed , it is still flourishing and gained nearly 13 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary elections in 2006 .
Its supporters are mostly those who are fed up with politics as usual and regime nostalgics , many of them elderly pensioners , for whom life before 1989 seems better than today .
The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia , named after the two main regions of the Czech Republic , is the direct successor of the Czechoslovak Communist Party .
While the party has sought to distance itself from its violent past , its many critics contend that it never really cut its umbilical cord to its pre-1989 predecessor — a contention the party vehemently denies .
Vojtech Filip , the Communist Party ’s leader , was adamant in an interview that the party did not support undemocratic regime change .
But he fell short of condemning the Marxist principle of revolution and called Karl Marx “ the greatest thinker of the millennium . ”
“ We are a legal party and always act according to the Constitution , ” he said .
Defending his party ’s philosophy , Mr. Filip paradoxically invoked Vaclav Havel , the former Czech president who led the revolution that overthrew communism , arguing that Mr. Havel himself had equated contemporary Czech politics with “ mafia - capitalism . ”
Mr. Havel , who languished in prison during the Communist regime , has also called the Communist Party “ a boulder weighing down ” the political system .
But many Czechs blame him for refusing to ban the party when he became president or to put on trial a system that allowed neighbors to send each other to labor camps .
Some saw in his approach a noble effort to avoid polarizing the nation ; others consider it a moral lapse that prevented the country from coming to terms with its past .
Lubos Dobrovsky , a former dissident and defense minister , who ran Mr. Havel ’s office when he was president , argued that it was not possible to ban the Communist Party in the immediate aftermath of 1989 because the reform wing of the party had been an essential ally during the transition to democracy and helped avoid violence .
The farmer displays the baby - shaped fleece - flower root .
A " naked baby boy " , which is actually a fleece - flower root at 62 centimeters long and 5.8 kilograms , was dug out of the ground by a farmer in Sichuan province on Oct. 22 , 2009 .
The baby - shaped fleece - flower root has a similar face with ancient people of Sanxingdui culture discovered in Guanghan City , Sichuan .
Zheng Dexun , the farmer , said he was not sure whether something good or bad might happen , so he decided to burry it back in the ground and let it go back to nature .
Physicists can rest easy -- the Standard Model of Particle Physics is still in effect .
More than 100 MIT students and professors jammed into Room 35 - 225 on Wednesday , April 11 , to hear the long - anticipated results of a particle detection experiment designed to produce evidence that would confirm or reject the model , which outlines the elements of particle physics .
MIT postdoctoral associate Jocelyn Monroe , who worked on the experiment , prolonged the suspense , revealing the results about half an hour into her talk .
The outcome ?
The standard model is still safe :
The experiment confirms the model 's prediction that there are only three types of neutrinos ( tiny elementary particles that are components of atoms ) .
Some of the assembled crowd seemed disappointed that the foundation of particle physics had not been upended .
" This was such a big question .
It would have changed everything " if they found evidence for a fourth neutrino , Monroe said last week , after her lecture .
Experiments done in the 1990s at the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector ( LSND ) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory offered strong indirect evidence for the existence of a fourth neutrino , but the results were controversial .
So another experiment , the Booster Neutrino Experiment ( MinibooNE ) was launched in late 2002 to try to replicate the results .
" It was very important to confirm or refute the LSND result , " said Monroe , a Pappalardo Fellow who arrived at MIT last September and worked on the MinibooNE project as a graduate student at Columbia University .
Neutrinos are generated by nuclear reactions , such as those that occur in the sun or in nuclear reactors .
Most come from the sun :
More than 50 trillion solar neutrinos pass through the human body every second , but they are extremely difficult to detect because they have no charge and a mass so tiny it has never been measured .
Currently scientists know that there are three types , or " flavors , " of neutrinos -- electron neutrinos , muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos .
Experiments have shown that these neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another .
However , the LSND experiments offered evidence for a fourth flavor , a " sterile " neutrino , which would call the Standard Model of Particle Physics into question .
The model , developed in the 1970s , is based on Einstein 's theory of relativity and outlines the 16 types of subatomic particles ( including the three neutrinos ) that physicists have identified .
" The Standard Model is the periodic table of particle physics , " Monroe said .
" If the MinibooNE experiment found that extra particles needed to go into that , it would have been very , very exciting . "
The MinibooNE experiment , conducted at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago , was designed to detect the energy traces left behind when a neutrino collides with the nucleus of a carbon atom .
The detection takes place in massive tank filled with 250,000 gallons of purified mineral oil .
Researchers generated neutrinos by firing a beam of protons at a target made of beryllium ( a lightweight metal ) .
When the beam hits the target , the protons produce particles that decay into neutrinos and other elementary particles .
During the three years that the researchers collected data , they sent 5.5 x 1020 ( more than a billion billion ) protons into the target , but expected to measure only 400 electron neutrinos .
" That tells you how difficult it is to measure neutrino oscillations , " Monroe said .
The researchers analyzed some of the data as they went along , but they waited until the end of March to look at the last one percent of their data -- in the range where evidence for the fourth neutrino would be found -- to ensure no bias in interpreting the results .
The team finally looked at the critical results on March 26 , during a six - hour meeting at Fermilab .
" It was such a dramatic moment , " Monroe recalled .
" Everyone was so tense .
There were people on MinibooNE who have been studying these questions for 17 years . "
Once the team started looking at the data , it soon became apparent that there were no energy oscillations in the range where they would have been expected if a fourth type of neutrino existed , Monroe said .
" I had mixed feelings , " she said .
" My first reaction was that I was happy with the results .
We predicted the background and we got it right .
My second reaction was that I was so disappointed that we did n't find the 17th particle in the standard model .
It would have changed everything . "
The MinibooNE team involved about 70 researchers from 14 institutions , and was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation .
The MinibooNE experiment is now running a three - year study of antineutrinos , and Monroe is continuing her neutrino oscillation studies at MIT with assistant professor of physics Joseph Formaggio .
She 's also working with MIT physics professor Peter Fisher to come up with ways to detect dark matter , which is even more difficult to observe than neutrinos .
Dark matter accounts for the vast majority of mass in the universe but has never been observed .

It ’s been about a year and a half since I ’ve written about this topic ; so I thought I ’d better update the disclaimer that I wrote at the beginning :
Before I start into the meat of this post , I feel the need to emphasize , as strongly as I can , four things :
I do not receive any funding from the telecommunications industry in general , or wireless phone companies in particular .
None at all .
In other words , I ’m not in the pocket of “ big mobile ” any more than I am in the pocket of big pharma .
I do n’t own any stock in telecommunications companies , other than as parts of mutual funds in which my retirement funds are invested that purchase shares in many , many different companies , some of which may or may not be telecommunications companies .
None of my friends or family work for cell phone companies .
I do n’t have a dog in this hunt .
I really do n’t .
There .
That ’s better .
Hopefully that will , as it did last time , serve as a shield against the “ shill ” argument , which is among the frequent accusations I hear whenever I venture into this particular topic area .
So , as I did back in 2008 , I just thought I ’d clear that up right away in order ( hopefully ) to preempt any similar comments after this post .
Unfortunately , as I have known for a long time , I ’m sure someone will probably show his or her lack of reading comprehension and post one of those very criticisms of me .
It ’s almost inevitable , either here or elsewhere .
Posting such disclaimers never seems to work against the “ pharma shill ” gambit when I write about vaccines or dubious cancer cures .
Even so , even after nearly ten years involved in skepticism and promoting science - based medicine , hope still springs eternal .
There are two reasons that I think the issue of mobile phones and cancer needs an update on our blog : First , it has been a year and a half since I last wrote about it .
At that time I castigated Dr. Ronald B. Herberman , who at that time was director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute for what I viewed as fear mongering over cell phones and cancer based on at best flimsy evidence .
Second , there have been two fairly high profile studies looking at whether there is a link between mobile phone use and cancer .
One of these our fearless leader Steve Novella has already discussed , but there was another one that he did n’t see because it did n’t get quite as much publicity , possibly because the corresponding author is based in Korea .
I will take this opportunity to discuss them both .
Over the last several years , as cell phones have become not only ubiquitous but have morphed into in essence pocket computers with Internet connections , there has developed a cottage industry of cell phone “ shields ” that allegedly protect people from horrible microwaves emitted by cell phones that supposedly cause cancer .
These shields , of course , do nothing of the sort ; objective tests of many of them show that they do n’t even do a good job of blocking electromagnetic radiation emitted by cell phones .
However , the data looking at the question of whether cell phones can cause some form of cancer has been mixed at best and consistent with no detectable association or possibly a very tiny association that just rises above the background noise , but even that is arguable .
One reason we have a lot of doubts over whether cell phone radiation can actually cause cancer goes back to a longtime focus of this blog and one reason why we emphasize science - based medicine rather than evidence - based medicine , namely scientific plausibility .
From a biological standpoint , a strong link between cell phone use and brain cancer ( or any other cancer ) is not very plausible at all ; in fact , it ’s highly implausible .
Cell phones do not emit ionizing radiation ; they emit electromagnetic radiation in the microwave spectrum whose energy is far too low to cause the DNA damage that leads to mutations that lead to cancer .
True , it is possible that perhaps heating effects might contribute somehow to cancer , but most cell phones , at least ones manufactured in the last decade or so , are low power radio transmitters .
It is also possible that there is an as yet undiscovered biological mechanism by which low power radio waves can cause cancer , perhaps epigenetic or other , but the evidence there is very weak to nonexistent as well .
Worse , as has been pointed out many times , epidemiological evidence for people who have used cell phones heavily for more than 10 years is sparse .
Moreover , it ’s not possible to study the issue by randomized studies , because it is impractical to the point of being virtually impossible to randomize people into groups that do and do not use cell phones given how essential cell phones have become to most people in industrialized nations and then to follow them for the 20 years or so that it would take to identify a link .
That leaves retrospective data , with all the perils and pitfalls inherent in retrospective studies .
One potential approach to such a study is to formulate a simple hypothesis .
If mobile phone use causes cancer , then after the widespread introduction of cell phones into a population there should be a detectable significant increase in the incidence of tumors that could potentially be due to cell phone use , particularly 10 to 20 years later .
That is the hypothesis that the investigators who published recent Danish study ( Deltour et al , Time Trends in Brain Tumor Incidence Rates in Denmark , Finland , Norway , and Sweden , 1974 – 2003 ) decided to examine .
It is a good population to examine this question in because the populations of these countries is homogeneous , cell phone use became widespread earlier than it did in the U.S. , and these countries have nationalized health systems that allow centralized collection of cancer data in national cancer registries .
The basic design of the study was as follows .
Investigators examined the cancer registries of these nations for the first incidence of brain tumors in patients aged 20 - 79 , noting this background :
Previous investigations in Denmark , Finland , Norway , and Sweden found that the incidence of glioma was relatively stable from 1983 to 1998 ( 7 ) and that the incidence of meningioma increased from 1968 to 1997 , more so for women than for men ( 8 ) .
Time trends in brain tumor incidence after 1998 are likely to be relevant for evaluating possible associations with respect to radio frequency exposure from mobile phones after 5 – 10 years of exposure .
We investigated time trends in brain tumor incidence rates in these four Nordic countries to evaluate whether trends in the incidence of brain tumor changed in Denmark , Finland , Norway , and Sweden from 1998 to 2003 .
This information is important to know , because if brain tumor incidence were rising before the widespread use of cell phones , then to find a correlation that might indicate causation , there would have to be a more rapid increase in brain cancer , starting with an appropriate lag time after the use of cell phones became so prevalent , likely at least five to ten years .
This is very much like the evidence for an epidemiological link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer , except that for the tobacco - lung cancer link there was a 20 - 30 year lag between the introduction of inexpensive , mass - marketed cigarettes and the increase in lung cancer incidence .
In any case , the resultant population examined in this study was , in essence , the entire populations of these four countries , where 59,984 brain tumor cases that were diagnosed from 1974 to 2003 among 16 million adults aged 20 – 79 years .
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words ; so here is Figure 1 from the paper :
Panels A and B present incidence rates for gliomas and meningiomas , respectively , in men ; panels C and D present incidence rates for gliomas and meningiomas , respectively , in women .
Circles indicate rates for those aged 20 – 39 years , squares indicate rates for those aged 40 – 59 years , triangles indicate rates for those aged 60 – 79 years , and a solid line indicates the regression curve .
As described in the paper :
During this time , the incidence rate of cancers known as gliomas increased gradually by 0.5 % per year among men and by 0.2 % per year among women .
For cancers known as meningioma , the incidence rate increased by 0.8 % among men and , after the early 1990 ’s , by 3.8 % among women .
This more rapid change for women was driven , the researchers say , by the 60 - 79 year age group .
In other words , there was a slow rate of increase in these tumors that did not change in the 1998 - 2003 cohort .
The reasons for this slow rate of increase are unclear , but because it began before the widespread insinuation of mobile phones into the population it is almost certainly not due to mobile phone radiation .
One possibility that could have contributed to this is the increasing use and sophistication of imaging technology like CT and MRI , which , as the authors pointed out in the introduction , can lead to an increased apparent incidence without any changes in etiological factors through the detection of asymptomatic meningioma , for example .
( Sound familiar ? )
In any case , there was no detectable evidence of an uptick in the incidence of these brain tumors after 1998 .
The lack of evidence for a change in the rate of increase of these tumors is consistent with three conclusions .
Either there is no link between cell phone use and these brain tumors ; the “ lag time ” for such an effect is greater than 5 - 10 years ; or the effect is too small to be detected in an overall population level .
One area where I will disagree with our fearless leader ( somewhat ) is that I do n’t consider this study to be weak evidence .
It is , in fact , strong evidence that , if a link between cell phone use and brain cancer exists , it is almost certainly weak and small .
Add to that the biological implausibility of a link , given our current knowledge about cancer , and I remain less than impressed with the claims that cell phones cause brain cancer .
I would be happy to change my mind if new evidence , either in the form of a biological mechanism being discovered that could explain how long term exposure to low energy radio signals could cause cancer or epidemiological evidence showing a clear association between cell phone use and cancer ( preferably both ) , came to light .
Unfortunately , the second study does not qualify as either form of evidence .
( How ’s that for a segue ? )
In fact , from my perspective , it is one of the best examples of how meta - analyses can be tortured to find tenuous correlations where none probably exist .
The study , which appeared in the November 20 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology , apparently slipped by my notice when it first appeared as an online publication on October 13 .
In any case , the study ( Myung et al , Mobile Phone Use and Risk of Tumors : A Meta -Analysis ) is , as the title says , a meta - analysis , meaning it ’s a formal way of combining multiple studies that may or may not have statistically significant results on their own , that may or may not have found a correlation , and trying to see if the weight of the evidence suggests a correlation between mobile phone use and cancer .
In this case , 465 articles were winnowed down to 22 articles using specific selection criteria , which were :
We included epidemiologic studies that met all of the following criteria : case - control study ( to date , no randomized controlled trials and only one retrospective cohort study published in four different articles have been reported ; therefore , we included only case - control studies in this study ) ; investigated the associations between the use of mobile phones , cellular phones , or cordless phones and malignant or benign tumors ; reported outcome measures with adjusted odds ratios and 95 % CIs , crude odds ratios and 95 % CIs , or values in cells of a 2 ( 1 ) 2 table ( from which odds ratios could be calculated ) .
If data were duplicated or shared in more than one study , the first published or more comprehensive study was included in the analysis .
I ’ll cut to the chase right now .
This meta - analysis does not –I repeat , does not–show any correlation between cell phone use and cancer , at least not in the overall results .
The authors even say so :
As shown in Figure 2 , the overall use of mobile phones ( use v never or rarely use ) was not significantly associated with the risk of tumors in a random - effects model meta- analysis of all 23 case - control studies ( odds ratio 0.98 ; 95 % CI , 0.89 to 1.07 ) .
Let me repeat that again .
The overall meta - analysis did not find any significant association between mobile phone use and tumors .
Of course , whenever an investigator does a meta - analysis and finds a result like this , he can never rest there .
He has to slice and dice the data to try to find a group for which there is a correlation .
There ’s nothing wrong with that in and of itself .
In prospective studies , post hoc subgroup analyses that were not planned in the original protocol right from the beginning are generally frowned upon because they have a high tendency to find associations that are usually spurious .
I tend to look at it as being a lot like making multiple comparisons but not controlling for them .
By doing a study to look at one population and a set of outcome measures but then , upon finding a negative result , going back and doing subgroup analyses , one is basically doing multiple comparisons without correcting for multiple comparisons .
Anyone who ’s been a regular reader of this blog should know that if one does n’t correct for multiple comparisons , the more comparisons the higher the likelihood of finding one or more false positives .
Even so , it ’s not necessarily scientifically dubious to do subgroup analyses if one looks at it as a hypothesis - generating exercise , rather than any actual conclusions .
Correlations that are found may or may not be “ real , ” but strong correlations may be worth further investigation .
What bothers me about this study is not so much that it did subgroup analysis on the populations studied , but rather how it did a sort of dubious “ subgroup analysis ” on the actual studies themselves :
However , a significant positive association ( ie , harmful effect ) was observed in eight studies 7,12,14-16,18,23 and one study by another group10 ) using blinding ( odds ratio1.17 ; 95 % CI , 1.02 to 1.36 ) , whereas a significant negative association ( ie , protective effect ) was observed in 15 studies ( nine INTERPHONE - related studies17,20-22,24-28 and six studies by other groups8,9,11,13,19 ) not using blinding ( odds ratio 0.85 ; 95 % CI , 0.80 to 0.91 ) .
No publication bias was observed in the selected studies ( Begg ’s funnel plot was symmetric ; Egger ’s test , P for bias .21 ; Fig 3 ) [ … ]
Subgroup meta-analyses by methodologic quality of study revealed a significant positive association in the high - quality studies ( odds ratio 1.09 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 to 1.18 ) , whereas a negative association was observed in the low - quality studies .
In subgroup meta - analyses by malignancy of tumor , no significant association was observed for malignant tumors .
However , a significant negative association was observed for benign tumors .
Neither the use of analog phones nor the use of digital phones was associated with the risk of tumors .
First , note that these odds ratios are barely statistically significant , ranging from 1.02 to 1.36 and 1.01 to 1.18 ; in other words , the 95 % confidence interval barely misses overlapping with 1.0 .
More importantly , I was very puzzled by the way that they chose to differentiate “ high ” quality studies from “ low ” quality studies .
Basically , although it is only one of the eight criteria used in the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale ( NOS ) for Assessing the Quality of Case - Control Studies to evaluate study quality , for some reason the Myung et al decided to focus primarily on whether the studies were blinded or not , specifically whether the status of patient cases and controls was blinded at interview ( blinded or not blinded / no description ) .
This struck me as most curious .
So studies that were blinded showed a positive association between cell phone use and brain tumors upon meta - analysis of just their results .
The authors also report that their subgroup analysis demonstrated that studies of higher methodological quality ( greater than or equal 7 points ) also showed a positive association between cell phone use and cancer for just these studies .
So does it mean anything that lumping the studies together that are of “ high quality ” produces a positive result where the low quality studies do n’t ?
Normally , I ’d think that it might .
After all , the studies showing the positive result are considered to be methodologically rigorous , although it should be noted that several of them individually did n’t find a significant association .
In this case , I doubt it means much of anything , and here ’s why .
Seven of the eight “ high quality ” studies were all by a single group of researchers , Dr. Lennart Hardell ’s group in Sweden .
Whenever one group of researchers keeps finding a result that no other group seems able to replicate or that otherwise disagrees with what everyone else is finding , that ’s a huge red flag for me .
Remove those studies , and even the wisp of a hint of a shadow of the association between cell phone use and cancer found in this study disappears .
I ’d have a lot more confidence in this seeming association in “ high quality ” studies if the association did n’t depend upon a single researcher and if this researcher was not also known for being an expert witness in lawsuits against mobile phone companies .
Do n’t get me wrong ; these studies could be correct , but replication is one of the checks on research in science - based medicine .
If other groups ca n’t replicate Dr. Hardell ’s work , I wonder why .
Is it something about the methodology ?
Is it something specific about Swedes ?
Is it something about the population ?
Are there confounders unique to his work that are n’t operative elsewhere ?
Until I see other researchers independent of Dr. Hardell and using a variety of different analyses find the same results , I do n’t have a lot of confidence in them .
Even the authors acknowledge that a weakness of their study is that “ we did not explore potential confounding factors in the studies by Hardell et al that reported positive results not found by other study groups . ”
There was another passage in this paper that I also found most curious :
We feel the need to mention the funding sources for each research group because it is possible that these may have influenced the respective study designs and results .
According to the acknowledgments that appeared in the publications , the Hardell et al group was supported by grants from the Swedish Work Environment Fund , Orebro Cancer Fund , Orebro University Hospital Cancer Fund , and so on .
Most of the INTERPHONE - related studies were mainly supported by the Quality of Life and Management of Living Resources program of the European Union and the International Union Against Cancer ; the International Union Against Cancer received funds for those studies from the Mobile Manufacturers Forum and the Global System for Mobile Communication Association .
I do n’t know about you , but I ’ve never seen a passage like this in a research paper or meta - analysis before .
It stands out like the proverbial sore thumb , and I can only think that it was placed there to try to cast aspersions , representing Dr. Hardell as the exemplar of Truth , Justice , and Science while painting the studies that failed to find an association between cell phone use and cancer as hopelessly biased , the product of Big Cellular .
At least that ’s how it came across to me .
It struck me as gratuitous .
So where do we stand now ?
My interpretation of the evidence thus far is that we can say with some confidence that there is no short term risk of brain cancer from cell phone use .
However , after more than ten years the evidence is less clear but trends towards either no detectable risk or a very small risk that barely rises above the noise .
It ’s possible that there may well be a risk ; it ’s possible that there is hitherto undiscovered biology that provides a mechanism by which non-ionizing radiation like the radio waves from cell phones could over time induce cancer beyond ten years .
Because more and more people are using cell phones over longer and longer periods of time , it ’s worth studying this issue .
If there is an increased risk , it may be possible to mitigate that risk by using headsets or through the design of phones that use less energy .
Mobile phone technology is a relatively new technology , though , and has only been widely available since the mid-1990s .
In the U.S. , it did n’t become truly ubiquitous until the early part of this decade .
Consequently , there has n’t been enough lag time for us to be truly confident of studies showing little or no risk .
On the other hand , it is reassuring that early studies are pretty resoundingly negative and that there really is no good biological mechanism that we have been able to find by which cell phone radiation could cause cancer .
In the next 5 - 10 years , more studies will be done , and , over that time , I expect evidence will answer the question one way or the other .
In the meantime , it ’s useful to keep things in perspective .
Each and every year , there are approximately 40,000 to 45,000 fatalities due to auto collisions .
Getting in a car and driving to work every day is among the most dangerous things the average person does .
Yet we accept this risk because automobiles are such an incredibly useful tool in modern life ; indeed , they are indispensable to most people .
Cell phones are clearly in that category as well ; so even if cell phones are ultimately found to increase the risk of brain cancer by , for example , 10 - 20 % after 10 - 20 years , it would most likely be a risk that most people would end up living with in order to be able to use these incredibly useful devices .
My personal reading of the data is that there probably is n’t a significant risk of brain tumors due to the use of cell phones , but I am not sufficiently certain to make any blanket statements .
I , like everyone else , will have to wait for the evidence to settle things one way or the other .
