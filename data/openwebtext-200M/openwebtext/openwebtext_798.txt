Tip : Prompt magic
Enhancing the system prompt
As Linux / UNIX people , we spend a lot of time working in the shell , and in many cases , this is what we have staring back at us :
bash - 2.04 $
If you happen to be root , you 're entitled to the " prestige " version of this beautiful prompt :
bash - 2.04 #
These prompts are not exactly pretty .
It 's no wonder that several Linux distributions have upgraded their default prompts that add color and additional information to boot .
However , even if you happen to have a modern distribution that comes with a nice , colorful prompt , it may not be perfect .
Maybe you 'd like to add or change some colors , or add ( or remove ) information from the prompt itself .
It is n't hard to design your own colorized , tricked - out prompt from scratch .
Prompt basics
Under bash , you can set your prompt by changing the value of the PS1 environment variable , as follows :
$ export PS1= " > " >
Changes take effect immediately , and can be made permanent by placing the " export " definition in your ~/. bashrc file .
PS1 can contain any amount of plain text that you 'd like :
$ export PS1 = " This is my super prompt > "
This is my super prompt >
While this is , um , interesting , it 's not exactly useful to have a prompt that contains lots of static text .
Most custom prompts contain information like the current username , working directory , or hostname .
These tidbits of information can help you to navigate in your shell universe .
For example , the following prompt will display your username and hostname :
$ export PS1= " \u@\H > " drobbins@freebox >
This prompt is especially handy for people who log in to various machines under various , differently - named accounts , since it acts as a reminder of what machine you 're actually on and what privileges you currently have .
In the above example , we told bash to insert the username and hostname into the prompt by using special backslash - escaped character sequences that bash replaces with specific values when they appear in the PS1 variable .
We used the sequences " \u " ( for username ) and " \H " ( for the first part of the hostname ) .
Here 's a complete list of all special sequences that bash recognizes ( you can find this list in the bash man page , in the " PROMPTING " section ) :
Sequence Description \a
The ASCII bell character ( you can also type \007 ) \d Date in " Wed Sep 06 " format \e ASCII escape character ( you can also type \033 ) \h First part of hostname ( such as " mybox " ) \ H
Full hostname ( such as " mybox.mydomain.com " ) \j
The number of processes you 've suspended in this shell by hitting ^Z \l The name of the shell 's terminal device ( such as " ttyp4 " )
Newline \r Carriage return \s
The name of the shell executable ( such as " bash " ) \t Time in 24 - hour format ( such as " 23:01:01 " ) \T
Time in 12 - hour format ( such as " 11:01:01 " ) \@ Time in 12 - hour format with am / pm \u Your username \v Version of bash ( such as 2.04 ) \ V Bash version , including patchlevel \w Current working directory ( such as " / home / drobbins " ) \W
The " basename " of the current working directory ( such as " drobbins " ) \!
Current command 's position in the history buffer \# Command number ( this will count up at each prompt , as long as you type something ) \$
If you are not root , inserts a " $ " ; if you are root , you get a " # " \xxx Inserts an ASCII character based on three - digit number xxx ( replace unused digits with zeros , such as " \007 " ) \\ A backslash \ [
This sequence should appear before a sequence of characters that do n't move the cursor ( like color escape sequences ) .
This allows bash to calculate word wrapping correctly . \]
This sequence should appear after a sequence of non-printing characters .
So , there you have all of bash 's special backslashed escape sequences .
Play around with them for a bit to get a feel for how they work .
After you 've done a little testing , it 's time to add some color .
Colorization
Adding color is quite easy ; the first step is to design a prompt without color .
Then , all we need to do is add special escape sequences that 'll be recognized by the terminal ( rather than bash ) and cause it to display certain parts of the text in color .
Standard Linux terminals and X terminals allow you to set the foreground ( text ) color and the background color , and also enable " bold " characters if so desired .
We get eight colors to choose from .
Colors are selected by adding special sequences to PS1 -- basically sandwiching numeric values between a " \e [ " ( escape open - bracket ) and an " m " .
If we specify more than one numeric code , we separate each code with a semicolon .
Here 's an example color code :
" \e [0 m "
When we specify a zero as a numeric code , it tells the terminal to reset foreground , background , and boldness settings to their default values .
You 'll want to use this code at the end of your prompt , so that the text that you type in is not colorized .
Now , let 's take a look at the color codes .
Check out this screenshot :
Color chart
To use this chart , find the color you 'd like to use , and find the corresponding foreground ( 30 - 37 ) and background ( 40 - 47 ) numbers .
For example , if you like green on a normal black background , the numbers are 32 and 40 .
Then , take your prompt definition and add the appropriate color codes .
This :
export PS1 = " \w > "
becomes :
export PS1 = " \e [ 32;40m\w > "
So far , so good , but it 's not perfect yet .
After bash prints the working directory , we need to set the color back to normal with a " \e [ 0 m " sequence :
export PS1 = " \e [ 32;40m\w > \ e [ 0 m "
This definition will give you a nice , green prompt , but we still need to add a few finishing touches .
We do n't need to include the background color setting of 40 , since that sets the background to black which is the default color anyway .
Also , the green color is quite dim ; we can fix this by adding a " 1 " color code , which enables brighter , bold text .
In addition to this change , we need to surround all non-printing characters with special bash escape sequences , " \ [ " and " \ ] " .
These sequences will tell bash that the enclosed characters do n't take up any space on the line , which will allow word - wrapping to continue to work properly .
Without them , you 'll end up with a nice - looking prompt that will mess up the screen if you happen to type in a command that approaches the extreme right of the terminal .
Here 's our final prompt :
export PS1 = " \[ \e [ 32;1 m\ ] \w > \ [ \e [ 0 m\ ] "
Do n't be afraid to use several colors in the same prompt , like so :
export PS1 = " \[ \e [ 36 ; 1 m\ ] \u@\ [ \e [ 32;1 m \ ]
\H> \ [ \e [ 0 m\ ] "
Xterm fun
I 've shown you how to add information and color to your prompt , but you can do even more .
It 's possible to add special codes to your prompt that will cause the title bar of your X terminal ( such as rxvt or aterm ) to be dynamically updated .
All you need to do is add the following sequence to your PS1 prompt :
" \e ] 2; titlebar\a "
Simply replace the substring " titlebar " with the text that you 'd like to have appear in your xterm 's title bar , and you 're all set !
You do n't need to use static text ; you can also insert bash escape sequences into your titlebar .
Check out this example , which places the username , hostname , and current working directory in the titlebar , as well as defining a short , bright green prompt :
export PS1= " \[ \e ] 2;\u@\H \ w\a\e [ 32;1 m\ ] >\ [ \e [ 0 m\ ] "
This is the particular prompt that I 'm using in the colortable screenshot , above .
I love this prompt , because it puts all the information in the title bar rather than in the terminal where it limits how much can fit on a line .
By the way , make sure you surround your titlebar sequence with " \ [ " and " \ ] " , since as far as the terminal is concerned , this sequence is non-printing .
The problem with putting lots of information in the title bar is that you will not be able to see info if you are using a non-graphical terminal , such as the system console .
To fix this , you may want to add something like this to your . bashrc :
if [ " $ TERM " = " linux " ] then #we 're on the system console or maybe telnetting in export PS1 = " \[ \e [ 32;1 m\ ] \u@\H > \ [ \e [ 0 m\ ] " else # we 're not on the console , assume an xterm export PS1 = " \[ \e ] 2 ;\u@\H \ w\a\e [ 32;1 m \ ] >\ [ \e [ 0 m\ ] " fi
This bash conditional statement will dynamically set your prompt based on your current terminal settings .
For consistency , you 'll want to configure your ~/. bash_profile so that it sources your ~/. bashrc on startup .
Make sure the following line is in your ~/.bash_profile :
source ~/.bashrc
This way , you 'll get the same prompt setting whether you start a login or non-login shell .
Well , there you have it .
Now , have some fun and whip up some nifty colorized prompts !

SAN FRANCISCO  Following the lead of other congested cities like London and Singapore , officials in San Francisco are considering a plan to ease traffic by charging drivers a fee upon entering notoriously clogged sections of the city .
Using $ 1 million in federal funds , the San Francisco County Transportation Authority is studying various “ congestion pricing ” options .
If approved , such pricing would make San Francisco the first American city to charge cars a fee to enter certain neighborhoods at certain times .
“ I want a San Francisco that is far less congested and far easier to navigate , ” said a city supervisor , Jake McGoldrick , who has shepherded congestion pricing proposals and is leaving office this week because of term limits .
Congestion pricing generally intends to nudge drivers out of their vehicles and onto buses , subways and bicycles by pushing up the cost of driving into certain parts of a city during peak commuter hours .
The fees help generate money to improve public transportation .
We all know that the growing
evangelical movement is one ( with a few left - leaning pockets exempted )
obsessed with sex .
Controlling it .
Punishing it .
Using
it to control women .
Stomping out most versions of it completely .
Shaming people who enjoy it .
And now , believe it or not , promoting
it as an important part of healthy marriages .
Wait , come again ?
Sex - positive
evangelicals ?
Well , sort of .
While they ’re not bringing
in enough numbers to drown out the dominant attitude of shaming , there
does seem to be a trend in the evangelical community of promoting more
and better sex within marriage — for the good of the marriages .
There are now Christian
sex shops , Christian sex advice columns , and Christian
sex blogs .
Most of it is tame compared to secular counterparts , but the fact that it exists at all gives pause to those
of us who spend quite a bit of time wrangling with evangelicals who
want to ban abortion , restrict contraception , put virginity rings on
girls , and teach nothing but abstinence - until - marriage .
But should this trend surprise
us ?
Upon further reflection , the whole thing makes perfect sense .
One of the favorite selling points for abstinence - only , reiterated endlessly
by abstinence - only " educators , " is that waiting until marriage means
that the sex will be even better , with the implication often being that
it works seamlessly without the learning period the rest of us have
to go through , and that it ’s so hot that others could n’t even imagine
it .
( It ’s a false promise — just listen to reports
from couples who waited , only to find out that they had compatibility
issues .
But it ’s never been beyond fundamentalists to treat the truth
as disposable in pursuit of a larger agenda . )
Evangelicals have an
investment in making sure that married sex is hot , so they can push
the abstinence - only line with more confidence .
But there ’s another aspect
to it that ’s even more important–people come to evangelical churches
because they need help running their lives , and if the churches want
to keep members , they need to offer that help .
In fact , one of
the most remarkable aspects of the modern evangelical movement is how
self - help -y it is .
Matt
Taibbi discovered this when he went undercover at James Hagee ’s San
Antonio megachurch .
Most of the work done in the church borrowed heavily from the dreck
of the self - help world , except with demons thrown in as a twist .
Certainly Rick Warren has exploited the melding of Christianity with
the self - help section of the bookstore with his book " The Purpose - Driven
Life , " which , from the title alone , sounds just like a self - help book .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Since the evangelical movement
is basically competing with self - help for an audience , it makes sense
that they ’d have to branch out into one of the most popular forms
of self - help , which is advice on how to make sex better inside relationships .
This kind of thing is n’t exactly new to evangelical Christianity .
In the 70s , the right wing power couple Beverly and Tim LaHaye co-authored a sex
manual that at
least said female orgasms were important — but scolded people who used
the popular oral sex method to get there .
Modern sex-positive
evangelicals are a lot more open - minded about oral sex , I discovered
as I perused various Christian websites .
What I found in my research
was a surprising diversity in attitudes about what sex acts were acceptable ,
though a shared fondness for obsessing over the potential sinfulness
of each act .
Of all the people pushing the " more sex for marrieds "
message , I found Joy
Wilson , who owns
the sex shop Book
22 , the most pleasant
person who really seemed happy to be helping people have more and better
sex .
Like the rest of the sites I read , Book 22 had the same nit-picking
" sin or not ? " specificity –dildos are out–but on the whole , her
website sells the same kind of products that feminist sex shops do ,
with the same goal of making sure that women are getting as much pleasure
out of sex as men do .
She
blogs about sex in a blunt , generous style that I found appealing .
The
Marriage Bed is
co-authored by a married couple , and while it ’s refreshingly positive
about things like oral sex and even spanking , it ’s homophobic and
sexist , like pretty much all the sites I visited .
Women are characterized
as wanting more snuggles and men as wanting more sex , and it ’s not
even hinted that it might be reversed in some marriages , or even that
snuggles might not be a chore for some men .
What I found most amusing
was their acceptance of fantasy was contingent upon making sure that you
only fantasized about sex between married people .
Like most of the sites ,
they demonstrate hostility towards female - controlled hormonal contraception .
Christian
Nymphos had a refreshingly
explicit nature , which is what people go to sex advice websites for .
If you do n’t have details , you have n’t learned enough to do it yourself .
Unlike Book 22 or the Marriage Bed , they do n’t seem to have any problems
with dildos or anal sex , so point in their favor .
Like Book 22 ,
they consider their mission mainly to make sex more fun for women , who
they assume have strong sexual desires .
They even avoid the fear - mongering
about female - controlled
hormonal contraception .
Despite refreshingly sex-positive views , though , they maintained the
same disappointing levels of sexism , telling women to suck it up if
they are left unsatisfied by sex
or promoting
female submission as romance .
What I discovered was that
women ’s influence on the message made it , if far from perfect and
often downright offensive , much more positive than the sex
advice and help that came straight from male ministers .
By contrast , look at Paul Wirth
of the Relevant Church , who recently made headlines with his 30 day sex challenge .
Unlike the female - run sites
that thrived more on suggestions and discussion , the 30 day sex challenge
comes across like a dictate .
You ’re to have sex ( if you ’re
married , of course ) for 30 days whether you ’re in the mood or not .
The reason Wirth gives for this is unsurprisingly sexist : " Every man’s
fantasy : 30 days of sex ! "
" Every woman ’s dream : 30 days of intimacy ! "
This idea–that the sex part of sex is for men , and women just want
the intimacy –threads through many sites , unsurprisingly showing up
more when men are doing more of the writing .
The challenge just
struck me as another way to use sex as a tool to control , the flip side
of abstinence - only .
Minister
Mark Driscoll of Seattle is
positively obsessed with sex , and belongs to this category , even though
there ’s something unnerving about it .
A big proponent of wifely
submission , and just generally bagging on women ( Driscoll blamed
Ted Haggard ’s wife Gayle for Ted ’s infidelities with male prostitutes , claiming that she had let herself
go ) , Driscoll also offers a video series in which he answers people ’s
questions about sex .
These
videos are pretty hard to take ,
since he ’s arrogant and pushy and just a little too interested in
what ’s going on in the bedrooms of his parishioners for comfort .
I suspect if the pro-sex movement in Christianity starts to really take
off , we ’re going to see more men like Driscoll take over , and the
control will be wrested away from the women who are currently
out there writing a kinder , gentler form of evangelical sex advice .
We kick off the interview by diving right into the UFO discussion as we talk about an amazing nugget revealed in Flying Saucers and Science : Project Blue Book Special Report # 13 , which was never released by the government ( volumes 1 to 12 & 14 were ) and which may constitute a critical " lost text " in the history of Ufology .
Next , we follow up on Stan 's statement in his new book where he suggest a wholly different landscape for Ufology in today 's world , had esteemed Ufologist James E. McDonald not died in 1971 .
Throughout this answer , Stan gives amazing background detail on McDonald and how he investigated UFOs .
After that , we find out from Stan why he thinks the nuclear rocket industry , which he was intimately involved with in the 1960's , fell apart and has n't been revived in present times .
He also speculates on why it is improbably that nuclear rockets are being developed " in the black " today .
We then talk about Stan's " feud " with Isaac Asamov and his chapter in the book dealing with UFOs and science fiction writers .
This segues into a discussion on Ufology 's public relations problem and we get Stan 's opinion on what it would take to make people care about UFOs , not just believe in them .
Within this answer , Stan also talks about some of his recent run-ins with hardcore skeptics .
Following that , we get Stan 's perspective on if he is surprised that Roswell has n't been solved after approximately 30 years of research into it .
Within this answer , Stan details his issues with the media and their perspective on UFOs .
Looking at another key figure in Ufology 's history , we find out about Stan 's relationship with J. Allen Hynek and if he ever tried to get Hynek to stop being an " apologist Ufologist . "
Wrapping up binnall 's questions for the interview , we look at the final sentence of the book , which is a call to action for Ufology , and find out what Stan thinks Ufology needs to do next .
Stan puts forth a number of innovative concepts dealing with public relations and handling the media .
The second half of the conversation revolves around Stan answering questions put forth by official BoA forum ( theusofe.com ) members .
The first question is for Stan 's thoughts on the potential connection between UFOs / ETs and altered states of consciousness .
Next , we find out why Stan and Kevin Randle disagree on so many aspects of the Roswell story .
After that , we get his take on what role classic Ufology has in a post - disclosure world .
Next , we get Stan 's opinion on what it would take for UFOs to get good coverage in the mainstream media .
He then get his pick for the best abduction case on record and why .
After that , we get his side of his " feud " with Paul Kimball that erupted this past Summer .
Going off the beaten path , we then find out what Stan thinks of sabermetrics in baseball .
Getting very specific , we find out what Stan thinks of the 1969 Sverlovsky , Russia " UFO crash . "
Next , we find out why Stan is not a subscriber to the Col. Corso version of the Roswell story .
We then get an update from Stanton on the journal article called " Sovereignty and the UFO " and what the fallout from that article has been .
Heading towards the close , we find out about the legitimacy of Project Blue Book Special Report # 14 .
The final forum question sees Stan speculating on where the US would be today had it continued onward in its space exploration after going to the Moon .
Wrapping things up , Stanton tells us what 's next for him , including a teaser of his next book .
While Digium plays in both open and closed source , the company 's enhancements to Asterix and Switchvox share a common purpose : more closely tying in other services and software commonly in use in the enterprise .
The new platforms come as the latest effort by Digium to capitalize on enterprises ' increasing interest in unified communications ( UC ) , which offers to move features like voice telephony , video , messaging and collaboration services onto a single IP - based platform -- which ostensibly helps companies cut costs in the process .
A recent studysponsored by Siemens , a UC vendor , reported that 53 percent of large U.S. companies are discussing , pursuing or implementing such installations .
UC has attracted all of the major players in enterprise messaging and VoIP .
As for Digium , UC and integration with other enterprise software is becoming a key feature of both Switchvox and Asterisk , for which the company serves as lead commercial sponsor .
Asterisk , an open source VoIP PBX , has been making waves in the market since its 1.0 release in 2004 .
While the coming weeks are expected to see some incremental new features and bug fixes with the launch of its 1.6.1 version , it 's the upcoming 1.8 version that will deliver several really slick features , Asterisk community manager John Todd told InternetNews.com .
But there 's method , of a sort , to the certifiable madness ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/20/2009 , 11:50 am PT
Two quick updates to the Coleman / Franken Election Contest / Mini-Series playing out in Minnesota , both via TPM's Eric Kleefeld , since we 're on another deadline today ...
1 ) All of a sudden yesterday , the trial began rapidly picking up pace for some reason .
A record " nine and a half " officials were " sworn in , direct - examined , cross - examined , re-direct - examined and excused "
2 ) Coleman may be setting an all - time flip - floppery record , as he has changed positions , yet again , on originally rejected absentee ballots that he agreed should be counted during the post-election hand - count .
The counting of those ballots resulted in a 176 net gain for Franken , leading to his final 225 vote lead over Coleman at the end of that hand - count .
As Kleefeld , who details the back - story here , describes it : " Coleman was originally against counting them , then for it , then against it , then for it , and now against it , in that order . "
While the new position seems nearly insane ( both on a legal , and practical level ) , the method to the madness is becoming clearer and clearer : Coleman , and his top legal hatchet - man / arsonist , " Swiftboat " Ben Ginsberg , are setting up the case for an appeal to higher authorities , to argue that the election was simply too close to call , the results within the " margin of error " , beset with " illegally " counted ballots , and otherwise " fatally - flawed " , and the election contest trial itself " a legal quagmire " .
All in hopes of asking somebody , anybody , ( SCOTUS please ? ) for a do - over election .
We discussed that gambit , and its likelihood of success in this previous article .
All of Coleman 's moves , of late , seem to support that same general legal strategy .
Amusingly and ironically enough , it was Franken who the nutty Republican National Lawyers Association ( RNLA ) recently described as " desperate " .
Go figure .

Ho Chi Minh 's socialist paradise did turn into a prison camp .
Welfare does indeed have a dangerous tendency to encourage dependency .
The nanny state can get ridiculous about eliminating risk .
And environmental regulations are often used as a weapon against legitimate businesses in ranching , mining , and logging .
The right has been right about so many things .
And the fight against abortion is certainly a righteous cause , although I personally believe that a woman should have dominion over her own body ( in fact , I can imagine a right - winger horrified by the idea that the state would extend its regulatory reach into the flesh of an individual citizen ) .
I 'm less sympathetic to the gun nuts , but the right to bear arms is in the Constitution ; it 's not like they do n't have some basic justification .
That said , the Republican party must die .
For me , the tipping point was when John McCain said the stimulus " can only be described as generational theft . "
This phrase , it appears , was introduced by the nutty blogger Michelle Malkin in a column on Jan. 7 and subsequently championed by Republican leaders like Tom Coburn ( " This bill is a generational theft bill " ) and John Boehner ( " This is not ' stimulus ' — it 's generational theft " ) .
So now all taxes are socialism and any kind of deficit spending is generational theft ?
This is just crazy talk .
But we 're used to crazy talk from fringy Republicans .
Either they 're trying to convince us that Adam and Eve rode dinosaurs or they 're insisting that 99 percent of the world 's scientists are wrong about global warming — and that they have a Professor of Dentistry at Oral Roberts University who can prove it .
That you can pay down the deficit by cutting taxes .
That the God of Love who embraced lepers and prostitutes is really the God of Gay - Bashing .
It 's almost hilarious the things these guys come up with .
And now they want us to take their economic ideas seriously .
This is a time when the overwhelming majority of economists and politicians all over the world agree that we need stimulus programs to soften the landing — after the Bush administration started nationalizing the banking and mortgage industries , no less .
Yet they continue to push another fringe theory that we 're supposed to gamble on in exchange for our jobs and savings and children 's future .
And once again , they 're using carefully crafted propaganda phrases like " right to life " and " death tax " to inflame and confuse the public .
But John McCain was supposed to be the sane one , the centrist who denounced the " agents of intolerance " and carried on unholy flirtations with reporters and Democrats .
Sure , he pandered to the base with Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber , but he was fighting a tough race .
It was politics .
He was in it to win .
Now McCain is using Michelle Malkin as a speechwriter .
He has embraced the fringy kookiness that , over the last two decades , has become part of the DNA of the Republican party .
Ominously , he warned that the stimulus was " the greatest transfer of not only spending but authority and responsibility to government " in history , raising the absurd specter of some kind of dictatorial state in what should be a rational discussion about how to save the freakin ' economy .
This now makes it impossible for me to take the man seriously — even when he 's making a valid point , like warning against the danger of " buy American " laws .
Instead of making himself useful to the nation by remembering that that " center - right " contains the word " center , " McCain has made his choice .
He 's a Palinite now .
The future is clear , and it will be ugly .
As the economy continues to stumble , the Republicans will attack President Obama every step of the way .
If he offers them largest tax cut in history , which it seems he may have , they 'll sneer at it and demand more .
Faced with major problems , they 'll focus on minor line items .
They 'll do everything they can to undercut the confidence essential to a recovery while attacking the patriotism of their opponents .
And if a Republican actually tries to influence legislation — to govern — instead of picking up his toys and going home in a pout , they will denounce him as " RePUBLICan Enemy Number One , " as Human Events slugged Sen.
Arlen Specter after he voted for the stimulus .
The headline was " Tar and Feathers Time , " which really does say it all : The Republicans are witch - hunting again .
They 're on a crusade for purity .
We know how this ends .
For all of these reasons , the time for bipartisanship really is over , as far as I 'm concerned .
Obama should keep making efforts because it 's the right thing to do , because good ideas can still come from poisoned minds , and because it 's politically effective to see him act so decent and dignified while his opponents squeal and bleat like such bumptious swine ( see below ) .
But beyond that , the Katrina Party must be crushed .
For the good of the country , for the good of the Republicans themselves , it must die to be born again .
And , really , these politicians should n't come back until they come up with at least one new idea about how to govern , because hearkening back to the grand old days of small government and lone cowpokes just ain't gonna to cut it anymore .
Thirteen days later , Dick Cheney 's interview with Politico still astonishes me .
Warning of the " high probability " that terrorists would attack the United States , Cheney suggested that the Obama administration was " turning the other cheek " — as if the continued Predator attacks inside Pakistan were some kind of pansy liberal scheme to love up Al Qaeda .
After a transition that George W. Bush conducted with real dignity and class , at a time when President Obama was eagerly reaching out to Republicans , Cheney managed to stink up the room .
But my favorite moment came when Politico asked Cheney whether he and Bush should have done more to help the economy .
" I do n't think anybody actually foresaw something of this size and dimension occurring , " the former vice president responded .
Hmm .
Sounds familiar .
" I do n't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center , " as Condoleezza Rice said shortly before the 9/11 Commission found that presidential briefing paper titled " Bin Laden Determined To Attack In U.S . "
Somehow it seems like we 're only counting the days until another memo is unearthed : " Bankers Determined to Destroy Global Economy . "
But Cheney is too formidable to represent his party in its present debased condition .
Here is the true face of the modern Republican party :

The New York Times has been furiously penning policy briefs to the Obama administration .
A recent editorial on black crime compresses within a few hundred words decades of failed thinking on public safety .
If the president - elect follows its hoary prescriptions , he will be guaranteed to waste taxpayer money without having the slightest effect on crime .
A new study of homicide among young black males prompted this latest editorial .
James Alan Fox and Marc Swatt of Northeastern University found that the number of homicides committed by black males under the age of 18 rose 43 percent between 2002 and 2007 , while the number of gun homicides by this same group rose 47 percent .
Homicides by white youth during that period decreased slightly .
But more significant were the different homicide rates that the report calculated , which no news story dared to divulge .
Whereas the report ’s graph for white homicides over the last 30 years plots the rate in increments of 10 , the black rate is demarcated at intervals of 100 .
The highest homicide rate for whites over the last three decades was 32 homicides committed per 100,000 males between the ages of 18 and 24 ( reached in 1991 ) , whereas the highest homicide rate for blacks was approximately 320 homicides per 100,000 males between the ages of 18 and 24 ( reached in 1993 ) .
Even this apparent ten - to - one disparity between black and white homicide rates does n’t tell the full story .
Fox and Swatt include Hispanic homicides in the white rate , though they do not disclose that they are doing so ( both the inclusion and the silence about it follow FBI practice ) .
Hispanic crime rates are between three and four times that of whites — meaning that if one excluded the Hispanic homicides from the white rate , the black - white differential would be even larger than ten to one .
The Times responds to the report with the key strategies of liberal apologetics .
Strategy Number One : strip moral agency from favored victim groups .
Bad things happen to favored victim groups because of forces outside their control ; good things also happen to favored victim groups because of outside forces — above all , wise government programs .
Any expectation that members of a favored victim group can take responsibility for their lives must be expunged .
Strategy Number
Two :
Never let the following controversial and dangerous word enter a discussion of the underclass — “ marriage . ”
The editorial initially conceals the Northeastern study ’s findings .
The report , it writes , suggests that “ violent crime among young people may be rising ” ; then , as if in a stray afterthought , the editorial adds that the “ study also shows that the murder rate for black teenagers has climbed noticeably since 2000 while the rate for young whites has scarcely changed on the whole and , in some places , has actually declined . ”
That finding — the rising juvenile black homicide rate — is the study ’s actual import , of course .
But the Times would rather contradict itself than lead with the politically incorrect truth .
Such evasions are trivial , however , compared with the misleading information that the Times pumps out about the causes of , and effective responses to , crime .
“ If the country has learned anything about street gangs , it is that police dragnets — hauling large numbers of nonviolent young people off to jail , along with the troublemakers — tend to make the problem worse , not better , ” the editorial observes .
But “ dragnets ” to haul “ large numbers of nonviolent young people off to jail ” are n’t official policy anywhere .
The warning is a red herring , introduced merely to create a contrast between mean - spirited and shortsighted police action and the wonderful social - services programs that the Times is about to recommend .
Having conveyed the impression of widespread heavy - handed police tactics , the Times then issues its preferred anticrime policies : “ Public policy should discourage young people from joining gangs in the first place by keeping them in school , getting them jobs and giving them community - based counseling and social service programs . ”
Note the transferred moral agency .
“ Policy ” should “ keep ” young people in school .
How , exactly , is “ policy ” to do that ?
Young people keep themselves in school by not dropping out or by not engaging in the behaviors that , in rare cases , get them expelled .
The only way that “ policy ” might have a greater effect on whether the students stay in school would be to declare that nothing is grounds for expulsion .
But even such a prospective amnesty for violence would n’t “ keep ” students in school who decide to drop out .
The Times ’s next antigang prescription — “ getting them jobs ” — is in theory more within the capacity of “ policy . ”
Government can “ get ” intending or actual gangbangers jobs , but they do n’t necessarily take or keep them .
Few teenagers from any background possess the self - discipline and reliability that employers seek ; teens growing up in chaotic home environments are even less likely to have developed a work ethic ( which is n’t to say that many inner-city teens are n’t courteous and enthusiastic workers ) .
It would be a great thing , of course , if a booming economy offered a job to every teenager who sought one .
But the biggest barrier to the employment of crime - prone inner-city youth is n’t lack of real or even make - work jobs ; rather , it ’s their own willingness to show up every day on time and accept authority .
As for the editorial ’s final prescription : there is not a single violence - plagued city that has not been administering “ community - based counseling and social service programs ” for decades , to virtually no effect .
Failed foundation - and government - subsidized youth programs litter the philanthropic landscape ; no “ social service program ” has emerged from that decades - long experimentation as the antidote to social breakdown .
The Times ’s explanation for crime is as fanciful as its proposed solutions .
It sees gang violence as driven in significant measure by the economy : “ The economic crisis has clearly created the conditions for more crime and more gangs — among hopeless , jobless young men in the inner cities . ”
The claim that crime results from a bad economy has limited empirical backing in general , but it is particularly ludicrous applied to juvenile violence .
It is not the collapse of consumer lending that induces a 16 - year - old to shoot a rival who “ disses ” his girlfriend ; it is a failure of self - control and a distorted understanding of self - worth .
The pathologies of gang culture have persisted throughout economic booms and recessions .
The black youth homicide rate rose 79 percent in San Francisco , 87 percent in Phoenix , and 139 percent in Houston from 2000 and 2001 to 2006 and 2007 , while those cities were experiencing the economic surge of the early 2000s .
The gangbangers in inner cities may be “ hopeless ” and “ jobless , ” as the Times puts it , but the reason is the same lack of moral capital that produces their violence in the first place .
In the Times ’s view , prison is something that just happens to black males in our society .
“ Once these young men become entangled in the criminal justice system , ” the Times writes , “ they are typically marginalized and shut out of the job market for life . ”
Never mind that you actually have to commit a crime before the criminal justice system “ entangles ” you .
And while it is unquestionably harder for someone with a criminal record to find a job , an ex-felon ’s work habits play as important a role as his criminal past in determining whether he permanently enters the workforce after serving time .
Liberal policymakers and pundits have spilled buckets of ink over the years promoting social - service programs as the solution to crime , yet — like the Times ’s recent editorial — those opinion - setters cannot squeeze out one word about the most effective anticrime ( and antipoverty ) strategy : marriage .
The marriage imperative civilizes boys .
By contrast , in a world where it is unusual for a man to marry the mother of his children , boys fail to learn the most basic lesson of personal responsibility : you are responsible for your children .
Freed of the social expectation that they will have to provide a stable home for their offspring , boys have little incentive to restrain their impulses and develop bourgeois habits .
In 2005 , the national black illegitimacy rate was 70 percent , and it approached 90 percent in many inner cities ( compared with a white illegitimacy rate of 25 percent , and as low as 6 percent in some urban areas , like the District of Columbia ) .
The disappearance of marriage from the black community is a social cataclysm .
Some highly structured , values - based youth programs , like the Boy Scouts , can provide boys a surrogate for the paternal authority that they lack at home ; society is right to support these lifelines .
But they cannot possibly bring crime down significantly among blacks in the absence of a cultural shift toward marriage .
True , no one knows yet how to revive marriage in the black community .
But given the imperative of doing so , you would think that somewhere in the flood of recommendations for more useless government social programs , a little space could be reserved for promoting the idea of a marriage movement .
Policing is nearly as taboo a solution to crime as marriage .
The Times editorial makes a desultory reference to “ more financing for local police , ” but argues — against all evidence — that “ programs aimed at providing jobs and social services are far more important . ”
Even that wan half - endorsement must have cost the Times considerable anguish .
The paper ’s real attitude toward the police was hilariously on display in an article on the New York Police Department published less than a week after its editorial .
Titled POLICE POLISH IMAGE , BUT CONCERNS PERSIST : IN POST 9/11 NEW YORK , PROTEST IS MUTED AS CRIME RATE STAYS LOW , the article drew on the second of the two story lines that make up the entire repertoire of the Times ’s thinking about the police .
This second story line —
“ Why is n’t there more protest against racist police tactics ? ” — gets trotted out when circumstances militate against the preferred narrative : “ Hooray !
Protest mounts over racist police tactics ! ”
Ideally , president - elect Obama would tear up the liberal playbook on crime that is so expertly summarized in the Times ’s pronouncements .
Obama ’s political affiliations make that course unlikely .
But if he pushed back against the Times ’s economic determinism and stressed that people from any economic background have the capacity and duty to reject a life of violence , if he called on fathers to take responsibility for their children ( as he has done in the past ) , he would start in motion a set of changes that could bring greater peace to black communities .
Thinking Inside the ( Green ) Box : Targeted Tax Incentives for Small Green Businesses
March 11th , 2009 by John Garamendi
Editors Note :
This is a guest contribution from the Lieutenant Governor of California , John Garamendi .
As a lifelong Central Valley rancher , I know all too well that our food supply and energy demands are interconnected .
When California faced record high gas prices last summer , my small ranch felt the impact when we received bills for transportation costs .
Our state ’s seemingly yearly succession of droughts , a phenomenon predicted by current understandings of climate change , have forced me to cut back on production , impacting my family , my employees , and the local community .
Those of us who work on the land are often the first to recognize that global economic and ecological shifts have an impact on the local level , and yet , it is often on the local level where we can have the greatest global impact .
The Commission for Economic Development , which I chair , released its annual report this week , offering economic development strategies for California lawmakers as they pursue policies that can best help promote new employment in California .
After extensive meetings with commission members and stakeholders , and after a thorough examination of the final report , I am convinced that California should consider the creation of targeted tax incentives for small green businesses that can deliver on the creation of new green collar employment opportunities for Californians .
The need to offer incentives to start - up and small green businesses is clear .
President Barack Obama ’s stimulus package calls for doubling our nation ’s renewable energy capacity in three years .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
High in the sky above Mars , it is snowing right now .
Very gently snowing .
The snow does not settle on the rubble - strewn land below - not these days , anyway - but instead vaporises into the thin atmosphere long before it reaches the ground .
The first flakes of snow , on a planet that until fairly recently was believed to be waterless , were spotted just a few months ago .
A Nasa lander near the planet 's north pole was scanning the sky with a laser when it noticed the telltale signs of snowfall .
The probe , called Phoenix , announced the news in a radio signal that was picked up by an overhead orbiter and beamed back to Earth .
Nothing like it had ever been seen before .
The news of snow falling is just one piece of an extraordinary wealth of information that has recently been sent back from Mars by orbiters , landers and rovers .
Together , they have mapped the surface in unprecedented detail , cracked open rocks , sniffed the atmosphere and dug down into the soil .
What they have found points to an unimagined Martian history , one where life may have once gained a foothold and may even cling on still in the frigid soils of the permafrost .
Mars is a planet where scale is redefined .
It is half the size of Earth , but home to what is probably the largest mountain in the solar system , the 16 - mile - high Olympus Mons .
Just beneath its equator is a truly grand canyon that also sets a solar system record .
The Valles Marineris is as long as the US is wide , and in places reaches 10 km deep .
The dream that refuses to die is that one day humans will climb Olympus Mons , and descend into Marineris .
But in the meantime , a different sort of exploration is going on - less glamorous , but arguably far more revelatory .
Earlier this month , Nasa celebrated the anniversary of the landing of two rovers that were sent to opposite ends of the planet exactly five years before , to study its ancient equatorial geology .
The rovers , Spirit and Opportunity , were designed to survive the harsh environment for just 90 days , but somehow they have survived , and they continue to astound Nasa scientists with the new data they send home .
Spirit has explored a world as fantastic as any imagined by JG Ballard .
It touched down a short distance from the Columbia Hills in a region named Home Plate , a plateau 80 metres wide .
Spirit found the plateau to be surrounded by deposits of opal .
As the rover trundled around , its wheels kicked up soil rich in sulphate .
Together , these two pieces of information identify Home Plate as an old volcano .
" If you were here billions of years ago , it would be exploding , fire - fountaining , with ash coming up and shallow pools of hot water evaporating into the Martian atmosphere , " says Ray Arvidson , deputy principal investigator on the rover mission at Washington University in St Louis .
Warmth and water rank highly on Nasa 's checklist of criteria for the emergence of life , and scientists have been making a credible case for water on Mars since at least the mid-1970s , when pictures sent back from the Viking orbiters showed deep channels , canyons and even features that resembled ancient lake shorelines .
In 2006 , Nasa had announced the then strongest evidence yet for liquid water on the planet , when its Mars Global Surveyor orbiter spotted what appeared to be stains on gully walls caused by gushing water .
On the other side of the planet , Spirit 's twin , Opportunity , has been having its own solar - powered adventures , driving around and analysing rocky features on an expanse called the Meridiani Planum .
From data sent back to Earth , scientists know that the rover landed on several hundred metres of sedimentary deposits that must have formed in ancient lakes .
The soil is inhospitable , similar to that in parts of Rio Tinto in southern Spain , where water bubbles up through iron sulphide deposits , forming sulphuric acid that dries into an acidic mud over the long , dry summer .
The rovers are guided across the Martian landscape by a team of 14 drivers based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
They arrange their working day to coincide with the Martian night , so they can work out the details for the next day 's excursions while the rovers are asleep .
The Martian day is 40 minutes longer than on Earth , so the team is constantly shifting the hours it works .
Before shutting down each night , the rovers send pictures and other data of their positions to an orbiter called Mars Odyssey , which relays them back to mission control .
There , the drivers confirm the rovers ' locations and decide where to send them next .
When the rovers wake up , they receive a day 's worth of commands telling them what direction to drive in and for how long .
All of the moves are run through a simulator on Earth to ensure the rovers wo n't crash into any boulders or drive off the edge of a cliff .
The process is arduous but it is the only way to drive a golf cart - sized buggy around a planet 100 m miles away .
Because the driving instructions are relayed via Mars Odyssey , they can take between 1 ½ hours and a day to reach the rovers .
Remarkably , though long out of warranty , Spirit and Opportunity are carrying only a few mechanical injuries .
Spirit , which parked up for the Martian winter with its solar panels angled towards the sun , has recently been ordered to drive south to investigate what look like once - exploding volcanoes that have since been eroded .
Opportunity has scrambled out of the 800 m - wide Victoria crater and is now setting off on a journey of more than a kilometre to a giant crater called Endeavour .
The rocks scattered around the basin of the Endeavour crater have been scanned by cameras aboard orbiters hurtling overhead .
They are unlike anything scientists have seen before .
Despite intense radiation ( unlike Earth , Mars has no magnetic field to deflect particles spraying out of the sun ) and temperatures that dip below - 95C , the rovers keep going .
So far , they have sent back a quarter of a million pictures from Mars and 36 gigabytes of scientific data .
While Spirit and Opportunity poked and prodded rocks dating back billions of years , the Mars Phoenix lander was sent to explore more recent conditions on the planet .
The probe touched down after a flawless descent in the Martian arctic last year , in an area known as Vastitas Borealis , or " northern waste " .
On arrival , Phoenix 's lead scientist , Peter Smith , of the University of Arizona , expected the lander to find precisely what Spirit and Opportunity had already seen : a landscape smothered in acidic , salty soils that could hardly be considered hospitable .
There was good reason to think as much : the planet is frequently hit by giant dust storms that can measure thousands of kilometres wide .
When they strike , they whip up the soil and scatter it around on a global scale .
The soil in one place , scientists thought , would be similar to that in another .
But built into Phoenix was a robotic arm that allowed it to reach down and gather clods of Martian soil to test with its onboard chemistry lab .
And as Phoenix 's arm scraped away at the frozen surface , it revealed clear patches of ice that quickly evaporated , making it the first probe to touch water on another planet .
On closer inspection , it became clear that the soil at Phoenix 's feet , in the planet 's arctic circle , was very different to that found by Spirit and Opportunity at the equator .
It was slightly alkaline , like sea water , and contained calcium carbonate , which usually forms in the presence of water .
" It told us that Mars is not the same everywhere , as people were suggesting , " says Smith .
" If the soil was acidic and salty everywhere , you would have trouble imagining life even getting started in a place like that , but we found conditions much like those you see in the Earth 's oceans , and for those of us looking for habitable zones on Mars , that 's good news . "
Scientists poring over data coming back from Phoenix are using it to work out what may have happened in the planet 's past .
Their best guess links the soil conditions to wild swings in the planet 's orientation .
As the Earth orbits the sun , it leans over on its axis at an almost constant 23.5 degrees , and in doing so underpins the regularity of our seasons .
Today , Mars is leaning over at around 25 degrees , but five million years ago , that could have been 40 or even 50 degrees .
By showing more of its polar caps to the sun , the Martian ice will have warmed up and vaporised .
The atmosphere would have become thick with ice clouds that later released snow , which fell to the ground and made the ground damp .
That , at least , is the leading theory .
Further tests by the Phoenix lander found traces of a substance called perchlorate in the Martian soil .
On Earth , some microbes use perchlorate as a source of energy , Smith says .
The picture that emerges from Phoenix is that millions of years ago , when Mars was tilted more toward the sun , the planet may have been hospitable to life .
Whether it remained so for long enough for primitive life to get started is another matter .
" We have nutrients in the soil , energy sources , and if there was liquid water five millions years ago , we 're getting close to an environment where life could live , " says Smith .
" If you tossed some Earthly life up there that had n't evolved for the climate , then it probably could n't survive .
But you have to wonder if , over a long period of time - say a billion years - if Mars slowly transformed itself from a more benign place to what we see today , whether little creatures could have evolved and maybe learned to survive .
Life does amazing things on Earth .
You can unfreeze the permafrost in Siberia and bring things back to life that have been encased in ice for a million years , so who knows ? "
Last week , the evidence for life on Mars received another boost , when scientists at Nasa reported enormous plumes of methane emanating from the planet 's north during the summer months .
Methane is not proof of life - it can just as well be released by geological processes - but the prospect that life might be responsible is tantalising none the less .
Nasa lost contact with the Phoenix lander on 2 November last year , after it had sent back 25,000 images from the planet .
The probe died , or perhaps went into hibernation , when a dust storm darkened the sky and blocked light from reaching the lander 's solar panels .
The probe 's batteries are now drained , and there is only a minute chance that it will power up when the sun is high in the sky again later this year .
In Arizona , Smith 's team is turning its attention to an unsolved puzzle in the Phoenix data .
Ironically , the presence of perchlorate in Martian soil ruined the probe 's chances of detecting organic molecules , which would surely be there if life is present .
By testing Martian soils concocted in the lab , and comparing the results with those from Phoenix , Smith believes he may answer the question yet .
Arvidson , who was on the Phoenix team and continues to work on the Nasa rovers , says the evidence from the latest missions points to a Mars that at least in the past could well have supported life .
" We 've been to three locations and each has its own story of water interacting with the surface and beneath , " he says .
" The question now is , was it habitable for long enough for life to synthesise and establish an ecosystem ?
We 're paving the way to answer that question , for the future missions that will really dig in and look for the smoking gun . "
Mars : the facts
Mars is the fourth rock from the sun and our outer neighbour in the solar system .
Mars has two moons , named Phobos and Deimos , Greek for " fear " and " panic " .
They were named after the twins that drove the chariot of the Greek war god Ares , their father .
Mars is nearly half the size of Earth but around one tenth the mass .
Mars and Earth have the same land surface area .
The gravity on Mars is a third of that on Earth .
The Martian year lasts 687 Earth days , and each Martian day is 40 minutes longer .
The Martian atmosphere is 95 % carbon dioxide , 2.7 % nitrogen and 0.13 % oxygen .
Mars has no magnetic field , so the surface is constantly bombarded by radiation from the sun .
What 's next ?
2009 - Phobos - Grunt
A Russian mission to the Martian moon , Phobos , to bring back soil samples .
2011 - Mars Science Laboratory
A Nasa rover twice the size of the Spirit and Opportunity probes .
It will collect and analyse rocks and soil .
Chief among its objectives is to find organic compounds and to check for environmental conditions that could have supported microbial life now or in the past .
2013 - Maven
A Nasa orbiter designed to look at gases being given off from the Martian atmosphere .
2016 - ExoMars
A European Space Agency mission to send an orbiter and rover to look for Martian life and possible surface hazards for future manned missions .
• This article was amended on Sunday 1 February 2009 .
Ray Arvidson is deputy principal investigator on the Mars rover mission at Washington University in St Louis , not at the University of Washington , an unconnected institution in Seattle .
A factbox accompanying the article said Mars 's two moons , Phobos and Deimos , were named after the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god Ares .
In fact they were his twin sons , who drove the chariot .
These errors have been amended .
“ I 've never been afraid of stepping in to solve problems for the American people , and I 'm not going to stop now , ” John McCain told a rally in Columbus , Ohio .
McCain takes credit for bill before it loses
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and his top aides took credit for building a winning bailout coalition – hours before the vote failed and stocks tanked .
Shortly before the vote , McCain had bragged about his involvement and mocked Sen. Barack Obama for staying on the sidelines .

“ I 've never been afraid of stepping in to solve problems for the American people , and I 'm not going to stop now , ” McCain told a rally in Columbus , Ohio .
“ Sen . Obama took a very different approach to the crisis our country faced .
At first he did n't want to get involved .
Then he was monitoring the situation . ”
McCain , grinning , flashed a sarcastic thumbs up .
“ That 's not leadership .
That 's watching from the sidelines , ” he added to cheers and applause .
Doug Holtz - Eakin , McCain 's senior policy adviser , told reporters on a conference call that McCain " dedicated the past week " to addressing the problem but made " a conscious decision not to attract attention to John McCain . "
" He 's made dozens of calls , " Holtz - Eakin said .
Asked if McCain bears any responsibility for the bill 's failure , Holtz - Eakin said McCain " improved it greatly — took the lead in the need for taxpayer protections . "
Making a similar point earlier on MSNBC , Holtz - Eakin said McCain deliberately " kept a low profile . "
" John McCain understands that had he looked like he was going to be the key to the success , that Democrats would attack him and kill the deal , " Holtz - Eakin said .
" That 's what you saw today .
They were not going to let John McCain do the job that he was trying to do : deliver a bill that would help the American people . "
" John McCain understood that had he kept a low profile , talked with members of Congress as he did , asked them where they were in their votes , called those members who were reluctant .
He was doing his job , and doing it with a low profile [ that was ] necessary , " Holtz - Eakin added .
Holtz - Eakin told MSNBC that Obama was " phoning it in " instead of working hard on a rescue .
" Where was Barack Obama for today ? " Holtz - Eakin said .
" He 's phoning it in — phoning it in — one more time . "
McCain initially had been modest about his role .
On Sunday , he said on ABC ’s “ This Week ” that congressional negotiators deserve “ great credit ” for the bipartisan deal .
“ " It was n’t because of me , ” McCain said .
“ They did it themselves . ”
But at almost the same time , McCain senior adviser Steve Schmidt was saying on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” : “ What Sen . McCain was able to do … was to help get all of the parties to the table .
There had been announcements by Senate leaders saying that a deal had been reached earlier in the week .
There were no votes for that deal .
“ Sen . McCain knew time was short and he came back , he listened and he helped put together the framework of getting everybody to the table , which was necessary to produce a package to avoid a financial catastrophe for this country . ”
On Monday morning , McCain campaign communications director Jill Hazelbaker said on Fox News that the deal would not have happened “ without Sen. McCain . ”
“ Sen . McCain interrupted his campaign , suspended his campaign activity to come back to Washington to get Republicans around a table , ” Hazelbaker said .
“ Without Sen . McCain , House Republicans would not have appointed a negotiator , which would not have moved this bill forward .
“ It ’s really Sen . McCain who got all parties around a table to hammer out a deal that hopefully is in the best interests of the American taxpayer . ”
The inauguration of Barack Obama already feels refreshing for at least two new twists .
The first is the president - elect ’s order to ratchet back severely on the special - interest money that traditionally floats Washington ’s panoply of victory celebrations .
Planners have barred lobbyists , corporations , political action committees and well - heeled foreigners from making their usual down payments on access to the new administration .
The other encouragement is the stroke of generosity by which a Virginia businessman is spending more than $ 1 million to rent prime hotel rooms and promising that assorted down - and - out citizens  from the poor to the terminally ill to wounded soldiers  will have a perch of privilege on Pennsylvania Avenue for the parade .
The Capraesque gesture  dubbed “ The People ’s Inauguration ” replete with two gala balls  is the gift of Earl Stafford , a 60 - year - old Air Force retiree who made a fortune founding a military technology company .
Mr. Stafford is picking up the tab for three nights with meals at the hotel for scores of the normally uninvited and overlooked .
He ’s even promising gown , tuxedo and hair - dresser costs for those most in need .
“ We just need to get back to caring about one another , ” Mr. Stafford told The Washington Post , paraphrasing the Bible : “ To whom much is given , much is required . ”
So Iz punched him ..

The more a woman has sex with her partner , the more committed she becomes , and the less attracted she is to other men — at least in the short - term .
I blogged about this study several weeks ago and offered explanations both hormonal and psychological .
But another theory came to my attention today in the form of a study on fruit flies .
For decades , scientists have known that female Drosophila refuse sex for a period of time after contact with seminal fluid .
This may give a reproductive edge to the first male with whom a female has sex .
A study led by Geoffrey Findlay at the University of Washington has finally shed some light on the phenomenon .
It turns out there are proteins in seminal fluid , many of which transfer to the female after sex .
Some of these proteins are warrior - like — they fight the sperm of rival males .
Other proteins are like hypnotists — entering the female ’s circulatory system , they may hormonally dampen her interest in sex with other males .
Somewhat disturbingly , the more semen a female is exposed to , the more influence the male has over her reproductive tract and her mating behavior .
Semen , it seems , has mind control properties .
So what does this mean for humans ?
The same study has n’t been done on men and women , but researchers speculate that many of the same proteins are in the semen of human males .
“ Does semen make you happier ? ” is one of the questions posed in BLONDES .
In answering it I describe a fascinating study at SUNY Albany that found that , yes , women who are regularly exposed to their partner ’s semen are less depressed than women who use condoms most of the time .
Hormones and proteins are absorbed through the vagina , enter the bloodstream , and possibly breach the blood - brain barrier .
Might these factors in men ’s semen manipulate women ’s minds ( and bodies ) in the way that fruit fly spunk affects female fruit flies ?
Perhaps , but it ’s hard to prove .
Women ’s love lives ( and psyches ) are a little more complicated than those of Drosophila .
After all , a woman in love with the man with whom she has unprotected sex would be happier and more faithful anyway .
It ’s a puzzle for all scientists who study human sexuality :
Where to draw the line between chemical love and Eros ?
The seminal and the sacred ?
n.b.
Here is a list of the potential mind - altering “ ingredients ” in sperm .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bankers say they are lending but try telling that to consumers having difficulty getting approved for mortgages , credit cards or auto loans .
In recent weeks , politicians have accused financial institutions of failing to extend credit , despite taking in billions of dollars in taxpayers ' funds during the past few months .
But financial executives , including the CEOs of eight banks that testified before Congress last week , have maintained that they are making new loans and that the nation would face an even more severe credit crunch had the government not thrown the industry a lifeline .
Still , it 's hard to deny that credit is tighter .
One reason , experts said , is that many non-banking entities that provide credit , often referred to as the so - called " shadow - banking system " , have withdrawn massive amounts of financing from the broader economy .
Money - market funds and insurance companies , for example , have typically been big buyers of debt from companies looking to raise quick cash , notes Rick Spitler , managing director at the New York City - based consultancy Novantas , which focuses on financial institutions .
That 's no longer the case , forcing corporations to look to banks for credit .
In addition , large institutional investors such as hedge funds and pension funds have shown little appetite for securities backed by mortgages , credit cards and commercial loans , hampering banks ' ability to issue new loans .
" The shadow banking system has n't recovered enough to pick up all the slack and bank capital is n't big enough to fill in for lack of supply and financing , " said Spitler .
Some community banks and credit unions have attempted to fill the void left by some of their larger peers but cannot keep up with all the demand for loans , said Sherrill Shaffer , a professor of banking at the University of Wyoming in Laramie who served as the chief economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during much of the 1980s .
Despite this , many banks are doing what they have always done during tough economic times - pulling back on all types of lending and trying to hold onto capital to help safeguard against further loan losses .
' Welcome to our banking nightmare '
Those excuses have done little to satisfy consumers who have e-mailed CNNMoney.com to share their stories .
George , a Wake Forest , N.C. resident who wrote to CNNMoney.com following last Wednesday 's Congressional hearing of leading bank CEOs , complained that Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) recently raised the rate on his credit card from 6 % to 15 % due to higher funding costs .
Small businesses have also felt the pinch .
Chris , a vice president at a Kansas City - based retailer with more than 500 employees , e-mailed to say his business was now struggling to find a lender after Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) pulled its credit line .
Another small business owner who operates a homebuilding firm just outside of Savannah , Ga. , said his company was denied financing by five different lenders , including regional giant SunTrust ( STI , Fortune 500 ) , for a loan to purchase a 1.6 - acre piece of property .
" Welcome to our banking nightmare , " the owner wrote .
Banks contacted for this story , all of whom were recipients of billions in government aid , stated that they were simply trying to manage risk in the current credit climate and that changes experienced by consumers or business owners were merited in some instances .
" All our lending decisions are based on doing what is best for our customers , our company and investors , " Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) said in a statement .
Citigroup , which has received $ 45 billion in investments from the government , said it was looking to change the rates on credit card account holders that had not been repriced in at least 2 years and added that those customers could opt out and continue using their cards until they expire .
" We are carrying out this repricing in order to continue lending in this environment , " Citigroup spokesperson Samuel Wang said in a statement .
Who 's creditworthy , who 's not
Other experts point out that while banks are tightening their standards , they are mainly doing so on consumers who earn less .
An online survey of more than 1,000 individuals in December conducted by Synergistics Research Corp. , an Atlanta - based market research firm that focuses on the financial services industry , revealed that overall , one in six consumers were denied credit in the past three months .
But for households earning less than $ 50,000 annually , approximately a quarter were denied credit .
So who is an ideal candidate to borrow nowadays ?
" Someone who does n't need any money , " said Charles Wendel , who runs Financial Institutions Consulting , a Connecticut - based strategic consulting firm that advises banks .
Credit still remains available for those consumers with a high credit score , a stable job and plenty of equity in their home , he notes .
In other words , banks may be trying to minimize the number of loans that may actually default .
" The guys [ banks ] do n't want are maxing out their credit card lines , " he said .
" [ Banks ] are lending , but lending more selectively . "
Still , many CNNMoney.com readers have told us that they have strong credit histories and are running into problems getting new loans .

Bush / Cheney : ' Most Impeachable ' House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers says President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney committed impeachment - worthy offenses which must be thoroughly investigated even after the two men leave office as a means of reaffirming U.S. constitutional principles .

Printer friendly “ The Bush Administration ’s approach to power is , at its core , little more than a restatement of Mr. Nixon ’s famous rationalization of presidential misdeeds : ‘ When the President does it , that means it ’s not illegal , ’ ” Conyers said in a foreword to a 487 - page report entitled " Reining in the Imperial Presidency : Lessons and Recommendations Relating to the Presidency of George W. Bush . "
“ Under this view , laws that forbid torturing or degrading prisoners cannot constrain the President because , if the President ordered such acts as Commander in Chief , ‘ that means it ’s not illegal . ’ ”
Conyers continued .
“ Under this view , it is not the courts that decide the reach of the law – it is the President – and neither the Judiciary nor Congress can constrain him . ”
Conyers also seemed to acknowledge what many Bush critics had long suspected , that the Michigan Democrat evaded an impeachment battle the past two years out of concern that the political repercussions might have kept the Democrats from winning larger congressional majorities and the White House in Election 2008 .
Noting that “ some ardent advocates of impeachment have labeled me a traitor – or worse – for declining to begin a formal impeachment inquiry in the House Judiciary Committee , ” Conyers said he disagreed with some of their political judgments but concurred with their assessments of the seriousness of Bush - Cheney misconduct .
“ Many think these acts rise to the level of impeachable conduct .
I agree , ” Conyers said .
“ I have never wavered in my belief that this President and Vice - President are among the most impeachable officials in our Nation ’s history , and the more we learn the truer that becomes . ”
Conyers also praised the many citizens who petitioned him for action on impeaching Bush and Cheney .
“ I want to make clear how much I respect those who have given so much time and energy to the cause of fighting for the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney , ” Conyers said .
“ While we may not agree on the best path forward , I know they are acting on the basis of our shared love of this country .
These citizens are not fringe radicals . …
“ They are individuals who care deeply about our Constitution and our Nation , and who have stood up to fight for the democracy they love , often at great personal cost .
However , as I have said , while President Bush and Vice President Cheney have earned the dishonorable eligibility to be impeached , I do not believe that would have been the appropriate step at this time in our history . ”
Documenting Abuses
The 487 - page report , released Tuesday , documents what Conyers called Bush ’s excessive claims of executive power and illegal acts .
It is the clearest sign yet that the 111th Congress plans to probe the depths of the Bush administration ’s most controversial policies .
The report contains 47 separate recommendations , including calls for a blue - ribbon commission and independent criminal probes .
Conyers said the recommendations are not intended as political “ payback or revenge , ” rather the goal is to “ restore the traditional checks and balances of our constitutional system … and to set an appropriate baseline of conduct for future administrations . ”
Conyers noted that earlier investigations failed to get to the bottom of many “ questions left in the wake of Bush ’s Imperial Presidency , ” including allegations of torture , “ extraordinary rendition ” ( shipping prisoners to countries known to torture ) , warrantless domestic surveillance , leaking the CIA identity of Valerie Plame Wilson , and the firing of nine U.S. Attorneys .
Last week , Conyers proposed legislation to create a blue - ribbon panel of outside experts to probe the “ broad range ” of policies pursued by the Bush administration “ under claims of unreviewable war powers , ” including torture and warrantless wiretaps .
Tuesday ’s report sought to arm lawmakers with the documentary evidence to support action on the bill , which currently has 10 sponsors
Last year , Conyers called on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether the Bush administration committed war crimes , a proposal that Mukasey rebuffed .
Conyers came under criticism from impeachment advocates last year when he refused to allow his committee to vote on articles of impeachment against Bush proposed by Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio .
Instead , Conyers ’ committee held an impeachment substitute of sorts ; a one - day hearing devoted to testimony by Bush ’s critics about the administration ’s alleged abuses of power .
The new report suggests that Conyers is not inclined to immediately “ move forward ” now that Barack Obama has been elected President .
In fact , Conyers said he firmly rejects “ the notion that we should move on from these matters simply because a new administration is set to take office . ”
On Sunday , Obama signaled in an interview on ABC ’s “ This Week With George Stephanopoulus , ” that he will not likely recommend that his Justice Department launch a criminal probe into the Bush administration ’s past practices , particularly policies that authorized torture .
Obama said prosecution would be possible if someone were found to have " blatantly broken the law , " but the President - elect expressed “ a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backward . ”
Also , on Tuesday , a federal judge ruled that the Bush administration must turn over to President - elect Obama ’s staff documents Bush has been withholding from Congress related to the White House ’s role in the firing of the nine U.S. Attorneys .
Conyers ’s committee has been pursuing testimony and documents from White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers about their involvement in the decision to fire the federal prosecutors , a move that a senior Justice Department official said was designed to remove U.S. Attorneys who were deemed not “ loyal Bushies . ”
President Bush has asserted executive privilege in blocking Bolten and Miers from testifying before Congress .
Last week , a new set of House rules was passed reviving subpoenas issued during the 110th Congress .
In addition to Miers , Conyers ’s committee subpoenaed former White House political adviser Karl Rove .
Conyers also said he wants to find out “ to what extent were President Bush and Vice President Cheney involved in the outing of Valerie Plame Wilson and its aftermath . ”
Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Cheney ’s chief of staff , was convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury in the Plame case , but his prison sentence was commuted by Bush .
“ There is considerable evidence that culpability for the outing of Valerie Plame Wilson and subsequent obstruction goes above and beyond Scooter Libby , ” Conyers said .
Conyers subpoenaed documents last year related to the Plame leak , including closed - door testimony that Bush and Cheney gave to special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald .
But the Justice Department refused to turn over the materials .
“ Given that so many significant questions remain unanswered relating to these core constitutional and legal matters , many of which implicate basic premises of our national honor , it seems clear that our country cannot simply move on , ” Conyers said .
“ As easy or convenient as it would be to turn the page , our Nation ’s respect for the rule of law and its role as a moral leader in the world demand that we finally and without obstruction conduct and complete these inquiries .
This can and should be done without rancor or partisanship . ”

Recently for the Corsair , I took part in a conference call interview with Bill Maher ( stand - up comedian and host of Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO ) who is currently promoting the DVD release of his documentary Religulous , which lampoons what Bill sees as the ridiculous beliefs systems of the world ’s different religions .
Unfortunately , there were several other journalists from different college publications and we only had 30 minutes , so I only got to ask one question .
You can listen to or read my question and his response below , and the audio of the entire interview is posted at the bottom .
Bill Maher Interview ( my question )
Me :
You once said on Real Time , I ca n’t remember who asked it , but someone asked if you believed in god , and you gave a sort of vague answer about how you believe in energy .
So , what I was wondering , and this may sound like a loaded question , but I am an agnostic , I was wondering if you think that there could possibly be realms to existence and matter that play any role in the physical world which scientific instruments can’t detect , and if religion has ever said anything , either in an esoteric or exoteric context , that has added to that intellectual discussion in any form .
Bill Maher :
Yes , I ’m sure it has .
And could there be something ?
Absolutely .
You know Richard Dawkins addresses this well in his book .
He says if we ’re talking about energy or nature , if we ’re going to expand the definition of “ god ” to really anything that we do n’t understand , then we might as well just not have the discussion .
But mostly when people talk about religion , they ’re talking about personal gods , people you pray to , people who hear your prayers , who fight devils , this kind of stuff .
And by the way , who need to be worshiped .
So , could there be something ?
Yes , I ’m sure there is something .
I mean , you know we can never answer this question , “ Why is there anything ?
How did we get here ? ”
Obviously there are forces at work which are beyond our kin .
But I ’m pretty sure the answer to the big question is not personal gods with suspiciously human characteristics , okay ?
That kind of thinking , you know , is what we ’re really attacking here .
I had several other questions I wanted to ask obviously , but a few of the other journalists asked similar questions that I was planning on positing .
So , I had to ask one that was further down my list , and one I thought no one else would ask .
I thought his answer was pretty good , but I also partly disagree with him ( at full disclosure , I am a huge fan of Maher ’s ) .
In all honesty , my question was pretty loaded , but it is difficult to explain why that is so in any sort of succinct manner .
I ’ve wanted to stay away from religion to the best of my ability in this blog , simply because there is no brief way to express my thoughts on the issue .
It ’s not that my perspective on the issue would be so complex that it would be over anyone ’s head .
On the contrary , I think if I took the time to express my thoughts pretty much everyone would comprehend it and either agree or disagree .
It ’s just that to do so in any satisfactory way would simply take far too much rambling that I ’m sure no one has any interest to read in a blog format ( not to mention in order to comfortably couch this within my agnosticism would take several long - winded caveats , including a rant about how we can never escape the human being ’s limited ability to receive and process information and the limited ability to communicate such information ) .
However , I did get to ask Bill Maher a question , so I suppose I will try my best briefly ( relatively speaking ) to explain how I felt about his response .
Bill has an agnostic leaning tendency that puts him a bit at odds with the atheistic Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens of the world , and Religulous and his answer to my question expresses this tendency well .
However , so much of the religious criticism of late , whether of the Maher or Dawkins sort , seems to spend so much time trying to dispel what I call the “ Santa Claus version ” of god , the idea that we must view the concept of “ god ” as the Single Sentient Creator Being in the Sky Who Watches Everything You Do and Judges You .
I rejected this Santa Claus - like notion of god as nonsense when I was about twelve years old , as I ’m sure many others also did .
I am well aware that a large percentage of the population has not come that far yet .
So , I understand the desire on Bill ’s part to make the argument he has made .
However , for me , the discussion becomes repetitive and boring and seriously lacking in substance and context .
Let ’s first take Bill ’s remark regarding “ if we ’re going to expand the definition of god to really anything we do n’t understand … ”
His statement operates on what I consider to be an extremely fallacious assumption , which is that there is some sort of universally agreed upon definition of “ god ” for which we are expanding .
No such universal agreement exists .
Even the dictionary lacks a concise and all encompassing definition of “ god . ”
Note *-
Even though it ’s one of my favorite topics and probably one the areas I have spent the most time researching , I ’m just not going to get into the etymological history of the word “ god ” and how it has been used and misused in different religions , and I ’m certainly not going to get into how , in my opinion , the contemporary conception of the Santa Claus - God does not jive at all , historically , etymologically , and esoterically , with the Abrahamic concepts of “ yahweh ” and “ elohim . ”
I also wo n’t be going into my take on monotheism or why I think none of the world ’s major religions has ever exhibited a true “ monotheistic ” doctrine , and that includes all the Abrahamic religions ( Judaism , Christianity , Islam ) as well as Buddhism which has a pantheon of spiritual beings associated with its cosmology .
However , suffice and obvious to say , no one person , religion or denomination can agree on what a “ god ” is either in the theological , philosophical , or even scientific sense .
So , let ’s move on to when Bill invoked ( pardon the pun ) the idea of “ personal gods with suspiciously human characteristics . ”
He uses this phrase as a pejorative , e.g. in a mocking sense to denote a concept he finds ridiculous .
This statement once again operates on what I consider to be a false assumption .
His statement assumes the only valid interpretation available is to presuppose the idea of a “ god with human characteristics ” is something that must be taken literally .
This is an area which really ventures into the different models of mythological / religious interpretation , e.g. the rationalism approach versus the metaphorical approach .
In the framing of his answer , Bill has taken the rational or literal approach that suggests we must think of these “ gods ” only as literally real entities which exist separate from the minds of those who worshipped them , and thereby also suggests this was the original intention of how these beings were to be regarded .
It is obviously impossible to know what was truly thought and intended by the ancient religious cults which utilized these “ gods ” in their rituals and mythos , especially considering the original cults which conceived of such ideas usually consisted of very small handfuls of people and , as such , should be regarded separately from the movements their ideas spawned .
( Also , here I ’m referencing “ gods ” with a lowercase “ g ” as in the concept of spiritual beings associated with different culture ’s religions / mythologies .
As I said before , I ’m not going to get into “ monotheism ” or the concept of “ God ” with an uppercase “ G. ” )
But there is no reason to automatically assume the ancients took such concepts literally .
It is just as possible the ancients took a metaphorical approach to their “ gods . ”
Bill talks about the pointlessness of expanding the definition of “ god ” to “ energy ” or “ nature , ” but it is entirely possible that the ancients did conceive of their “ gods ” as metaphorical aspects of nature and energy , and did not necessarily take the personifications literally .
And the fact that such “ gods ” were conceived with “ human characteristics ” is not so suspicious to me either .
Rudolf Steiner once wrote something interesting on this issue , though he was paraphrasing the Greek philosopher Xenophanes .
He suggested that if horses rather than humans had the ego - consciousness we possess and the ability to communicate in language , then the “ horses would make gods assuming the visages of horses . ”
People write and think about what they know and what is familiar .
If you are going to imbue an aspect of nature or energy with the spirit of personality as a literary device , the easiest metaphor available is to personify it with human characteristics .
( See the work of Carl Jung , Joseph Campbell and Israel Regardie , to name a few , who have all written extensively about this . )
One of my favorite examples of a similar concept is the ancient idea of the “ classical elements , ” being earth , water , air and fire .
The ancient Greeks specifically used these elements , but many different cultures had similar or identical ideas .
Every object within the material world was said to be represented by one of these four elements .
The rationalism school of interpretation suggests they literally thought all objects were made of one of these materials .
But the metaphorical approach could suggest what they were really saying is that all forms of matter could take one of four states : solid ( earth ) , liquid ( water ) , gas ( air ) , or plasma / fiery state ( fire ) .
Many people have written about the striking similarities that modern quantum theory and astrophysics share with some of the ideas expressed in the cosmology and esotericism of ancient religions / mythologies .
Ancient religions / mythologies were the proto - sciences of the time , and I , for one , am not willing to disregard everything they said as the ramblings of unlearned savages ( even though a fair amount of the cultural and political fluff appended to the ancient religious texts probably could and should be disregarded ) .
What is even more fascinating to me is that the ancients did not possess fancy instruments and computers to process their data .
All they had were their minds .
And I am aware that the vast majority of religious followers today ( probably 99 % ) practice a very juvenile and literal exoteric interpretation of the original religious texts .
But the vast majority of people also thought Transformers was a great movie and continue to buy Nickelback albums .

The known region of the red lamps of Amsterdam occupies large region in oldest part of the city .
Although in this region there is the specific fascination because of the ancient buildings , this place in essence attracts by its tempting night life .
Here are located numerous shops , which propose legally light narcotics , and also sex stores with the inconceivable assortment and other institutions of sexual nature .
The half - naked prostitutes in the illuminated windows , that propose its services are opened to community , they are , undoubtedly , the main sights of region .
Why Bill Gates Is Better Than You In Bed
It turns out size does matter when it comes to satisfying women — just not in the way you might think .
A study released this week suggests the bigger your wallet , the more you ’re able to make your lady moan .
The research , conducted by Newcastle University in the United Kingdom , says women actually have more orgasms when they ’re in bed with rich men .
A man ’s money proved to be a stronger indicator of his partner ’s pleasure than body symmetry or even overall attractiveness .
Sound crazy ?
The scientists suspect the whole thing comes down to evolution : A guy with a thick billfold is likely to be able to provide for a woman and her children .
She consequently climaxes , then , to “ signal loyalty ” and keep him around .
“ It serves to discriminate between males on the basis of their quality , ” the researchers say .
For the record , I ’m rich at heart , even if not on paper .
Non-reversing mirror
This mirror does not produce a " mirror " image , making it possible to read reflected text normally .
Hicks , a mathematician at Drexel University , Philadelphia , used computer algorithms to generate the mirror 's bizarre surface , which curves and bends in different directions .
The curves direct rays from an object across the mirror 's face before sending them back to the viewer , flipping the conventional mirror image .
As well as neat tricks like this , Hicks ' models make it possible to design mirrors that provide wide angled - views or eliminate distortion .
( Image : Andrew Hicks )
Driver - side mirror
Hicks ' take on the driver - side mirror ( top ) provides much more information than the conventional kind .
The new design provides a massive 45° field of view compared to typical driver - side mirrors , which provide drivers with only a 17° field of view .
US regulations ban driver - side mirrors with a curved surface , but Hicks is hoping to sell his designs in markets such as Europe where they are permitted .

Parabolic mirror
Any shiny convex surface , like a Christmas tree bauble , can reflect a wide panoramic image .
But objects are distorted so that they change size as they move across the reflection , even if their distance from the reflecting surface is constant .
This panoramic mirror reflects a full 360° along the horizon view without any distortion .
As long as an object is at the same distance from the mirror , it appears the same size wherever it is reflected .

Perspective rectifying mirror
This mirror reflects a wide - angled view without distortion - straight lines in the real world translate to straight lines on the convex surface .
It was made for a stair - climbing robot at the University of Pennsylvania .
A camera pointed at the mirror can see a very wide - angled view in which the stairs appear straight , making navigation easier .

Infrared mirror
Mirrors may be used for reflecting any wavelength of electromagnetic radiation .
This one reflects infrared light using a thin coating invisible to the eye .
It is designed for an imaging system that takes wide - angle infrared images of humans , revealing heat loss and even body temperature at a distance .

The largest utility in California , squeezed by rising demand for electricity and looming state deadlines to curb fossil fuels , has signed a deal to buy solar power from seven immense arrays of mirrors , towers and turbines to be installed in the Mojave Desert .
The contracts amount to the world ’s largest single deal for new solar energy capacity , said officials from the utility , Southern California Edison , and BrightSource Energy , the company that would build and run the plants .
When fully built , the solar arrays on a sunny day would supply 1,300 megawatts of electricity , somewhat more than a modern nuclear power plant .
That is enough electricity to power about 845,000 homes .
The companies acknowledged that several hurdles would have to be surmounted before the first surge of electricity flows from the desert  in theory around 2013  toward power - hungry cities more than 200 miles away .
First is approval by the state Public Utilities Commission .
But more challenging , they said , is a series of permits for improving transmission lines .
That process in the past has taken seven to 10 years per project , said Stuart R. Hemphill , vice president for renewable and alternative power for the utility .
PHOENIX --
The Phoenix Suns have suspended Jason Richardson for one game without pay as the result of his arrest on allegations he was driving 55 mph above the limit with his unrestrained 3 - year - old son in the car .
In a brief statement late Monday afternoon , the Suns said Richardson would miss Tuesday night 's home game against the Los Angeles Clippers " for conduct detrimental to the team . "
The one - game suspension will cost him $ 111,111 of his $ 12.2 million annual salary .
A Scottsdale police officer first saw Richardson driving 67 mph in a 40 mph zone Sunday night and followed him , police said Monday .
That 's when the officer clocked him at 90 mph in a 35 mph zone and pulled him over .
Police said Richardson admitted to speeding and identified himself as a Suns player .
The officer saw Richardson 's son in the back seat of the car and that he was not in a child seat .
Richardson said he had taken his son to dinner and was on his way home .
He was arrested and charged with reckless driving , excessive speeding and failure to use a child seat .
He was released from jail after a few hours .
Police said Richardson 's fiancee responded to the scene of the stop and took custody of the boy .
Richardson spoke briefly to reporters after the Suns practiced on Monday .
" I just want to apologize to everybody -- my teammates , my family , especially my fiancee , " he said .
" It 's a tough time for me .
I 've been questioned as a basketball player , questioned as a person , but my fatherhood in question is tough , because I try to be the best father I can be , and try to keep my kids out of harm 's way . "
The Suns announced the suspension about two hours later .
It was Richardson 's second run-in with the law since the Dec. 12 trade that brought him to Phoenix from Charlotte in exchange for Raja Bell , Boris Diaw and Sean Singletary .
Richardson was cited Dec. 21 on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol .
He was stopped by a Salt River Pima - Maricopa Indian Community police officer and accused of having a blood alcohol level above 0.08 percent and of failure to drive in one lane .
At the time , Richardson called the incident " one stupid mistake I made , " and he said he hoped it would n't change the public 's perception of him .
Richardson is averaging 15.6 points , third - highest on the team behind Amare Stoudemire and Shaquille O'Neal , in 28 games since joining the Suns .
Hasan Uncular : Dear Gilad ,
How do you evaluate the Israeli carnage in Gaza ?
Gilad Atzmon : Dear Hasan , I do n’t really think that it is a matter of evaluation .
We are all aware of the level of destruction brought upon innocent civilians by the Jewish state .
Gaza looks as if it was nuked .
Yet , as we know , the devastation is not the outcome of a single atomic bomb .
It was actually a merciless and lengthy campaign conducted by a national and popular army that employed a chain of heavy bombardment using conventional and unconventional shells .
Gaza ’s carnage is the outcome of a sinister , continuous , intense air raid against civilians in the most populated spot on this planet .
Hence , rather than evaluating the carnage itself , I am very interested in the evaluation of the people who are capable of bringing such destruction about .
In other words , I am interested in the Israeli and the Jewish collective identity .
I wonder how is it possible that the Israelis , the people who were ‘ raised from the ashes ’ , have matured collectively into the embodiment of modern evil .
How is it that Diaspora Jews happen to institutionally support Israel and its crimes against humanity ?
HU : Why does Israel always break the international laws and does not obey the agreements ?
GA : I assume that the Israeli is imbued with feelings of superiority that have something to do with the secular interpretation of the notion of Jewish Chosenness .
At the end of the day , Israel is the Jewish state .
Though Israel is largely a secular society , it manages to maintain the Judaic heritage of racial supremacy .
It is actually the secular nationalist interpretation of Judaic tradition that had evolved into a collective murderous inclination .
It is important to note that while within the Judaic context , chosenness is interpreted as a moral burden in which Jews are demanded to stand as an exemplification of ethical behaviour , in the Jewish state , chosenness is interpreted as an entitlement to dominate and kill .
Since the Israelis regard themselves as the chosen people , they clearly feel free of any ethical or moral concerns .
Moreover , they are not concerned at all with other peoples ’ or nations ’ judgment or thought .
This arrogant philosophy was defined by Israeli PM David Ben Gurion in the 1950 ’s when he said , “ it does n’t matter what the Goyim ( Gentiles ) say , the only thing that matters is what the Jews do . ”
HU : What is the importance of PM Erdogan ’s reaction in Davos ?
GA : For me it is clear that PM Erdogan was rather courageous in confronting the Israeli lie on an international stage .
Moreover , he really hit the nail on the head by exposing the ultimate symbol of this very lie .
I am referring here to war criminal President Shimon Peres , who in spite of his devastating past ( Kefar Kana , Nuclear reactor Dimona etc. ) has managed to grab a Nobel Prize for peace .
Considering his contribution to the Dimona WMD project , a Nobel Prize in nuclear physics would be more appropriate .
HU : How does / can the Jewish lobby work against PM Erdogan and the Jews with conscience ?
GA : This is a very good question , I am not an expert on Jewish lobbying tactics .
However I am fully aware of their influence .
As long as British Labour finance is run by rabid Zionists such as Lord cash Machine Levy and as long as White House chief of staff is a rabid Zionist , we should expect Zionist interests to shape our reality and this means a lot of conflicts , carnage and blood of innocent civilians .
However , we have to bear in mind that the tide is turning .
What we see and hear in Gaza brings about a mass indignation against Israel and its lobbies around the world .
It is hard for me to predict what the measures taken by Jewish lobbies against PM Erdogan will be .
He can probably expect himself to be presented as their new anti-Semite protagonist .
As we know it does n’t take a lot to become one .
While in the old days , anti-Semites were those who did n’t like Jews , nowadays , anti-Semites are those the Jews Hate .
Nevertheless , we must bear in mind that Turkey ’s friendship is very important for Israel .
Turkey had been Israel ’s only friend in the region .
Lately , it had been a negotiator with Syria .
In short , Israel needs Turkey .
HU : How can the Israeli - Turkish relations be effected after the Erdogan - Peres clash in Davos ?
GA : I really prefer not to answer this question , I am not exactly an expert on the subject …
HU : What kind of days are waiting for Israel and Turkey in the global political arena ?
GA : Again , international affairs is n’t exactly a topic I specialise in .
HU : Do you have a final message for the world and the Turkish people ?
GA : I do not like to come with final messages for three reasons :
1 . I do not like final statements , I insist upon reserving the option of regretting and want to be able to revise my views on every possible topic .
2 . I believe that people who come with ‘ final messages ’ must be very important and clever .
I am more of an artist .
I look into myself , and I share what I see with my listeners and readers .
3 . Unlike politicians who know what is right and wrong for other people , I hardly know what is right for myself .
However , my politics , so to say , are very simple .
I am looking for an ethical voice .
It means that in any given circumstance , I would try to find out myself what is right and what is wrong .
I do not believe in dogmatism .
I insist that the ethical search is a dynamic process of shaping and reshaping .
A week ago or so , a friend of mine , the legendary musician Robert Wyatt , helped me put it into words in the most eloquent and simple way .
“ My politics , ” he said , “ is very simple , I am just an anti-racist ” .
This is really what it is all about , being an ‘ anti-racist . ’
I am totally against any form of racist politics and this is why I despise any form of Jewish politics left , right and centre .
I am tired of all these ‘ Jew only ’ settings .
Whether it is the ‘ Jews only state ’ or ‘ Jews for peace . ’
I am against it because ; it is there to promote Jewish tribal interests rather than humanity and brotherhood .
The Jewish political experience is somehow always racially orientated and chauvinist to the bone .
Though I believe that people are entitled to fight for their rights e.g. , the Palestinian national struggle , I also believe that people should know how to reinstate peace and harmony .
As far as Israel and Jewish politics is concerned , this is exactly what we lack .
All we see is vengeance and anger that lead to more and more violence .
It is rather apparent that Israelis are not familiar with the notion of mercy and compassion .
Jesus ’ spiritually harmonious suggestion known as ‘ turning the other cheek ’ sounds to the Israeli as an amusing ludicrous concept .
Apparently , for them , ‘ shock and awe ’ , sounds far more appealing .
They democratically vote for carnage , destruction and genocide .
At the end of the day , they are entitled to vote .
They are the ‘ only democracy in the Middle East , ’ at least this is what they claim to be .
My Krugman post brought a lot of emails asking about my assertion that “ the vast majority of today ’s rich did n’t inherit their money , but made it themselves . ”
For the sake of brevity , I did n’t cite the research behind the statement .
But since many of you have asked , and we aim to please here at the Wealth Report , here are my three main data points :

We saw a pretty sophisticated vending machine at CES this year , but it ca n’t hold a candle to these new machines selling Kit Kats in London , since they have a real live ( for a while , anyway ) human inside them .
The economy must suck pretty badly for “ vending machine gnome ” to be an actual job now , but on the upside , you ’d get to enjoy such perks as easy access to change and unlimited fresh Kit Kat smell .
For the purchaser , it works just like a standard vending machine .
Try to shake it , fail , try to stick your arm up the slot , fail , and as a last resort put your money in , tell the machine what you want , and enjoy your snack .
If you ’re poor and desperate , though , this is one vending machine you might actually be able to threaten some candy out of .

To millions of armchair sports fans , Steve Rider is the unflappable television frontman whose sunny demeanour permeates coverage of golf and grand prix .
But when it comes to his holiday cottage in a quiet Devon hamlet , the broadcaster seems to have found himself in the middle of a row after opposing plans to build affordable housing .
The 58 - year - old ITV presenter has pitted himself against a septuagenarian landowner who has put forward a proposal for six cottages in East Portlemouth on the Salcombe Estuary , which has become the summer retreat of choice in recent years for second home - owning celebrities , including Damon Albarn , Kate Bush and Rik Mayall .
Such is the desirability of housing in East Portlemouth that the average price of a detached house is now more than £ 2 m .
Plans to be considered today by a planning committee at South Hams District Council show that the six affordable homes would be rented to local families unable to buy a property in the area or offered with a joint equity scheme in which the new residents could own up to 49 per cent .
The West Country is one of the regions of Britain most dramatically hit by an influx of arrivals willing to pay increased property prices for the quality of life offered in the villages of counties such as Devon and Cornwall .
Between 1996 and 2006 , 1.1 million left the region and were replaced by 1.4 million incomers , many of them second home - owners .
Campaigners have warned the result is " ghost villages " where half the homes are unoccupied for 80 per cent of the year .
Mr Rider , who said he and his wife Jane had been residents of East Portlemouth for six years , insisted he was not trying to drive out locals and criticised animosity towards holiday - home owners , saying they were " vital to the local economy " .

In a letter to the council setting out his objections , the broadcaster said there were no jobs , amenities or public transport in the village for the residents of proposed affordable homes .
He said : " The actual character of East Portlemouth is one of a unique peace and solitude .
If this is threatened , then it could be lost for ever . "
The debate has split residents of the village , in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty , with some second - home owners threatening to take their business elsewhere ; others support the scheme , describing it as " vital for the long - term viability " of the community .
The project was put forward by Isobel Waterhouse , 72 , who was praised last year for resisting the urge to cash in when she turned over four properties for social housing rather than sell them .
Lindsey Lindley , chairman of the parish council , said yesterday : " Isobel is single - handedly saving our community and the future of the village .
We have an ageing population and it is difficult for people to buy homes they can afford and to work in the village . "
However , an official report on the scheme has recommended it be refused because it does not " strictly " meet the definition of affordable housing .
We 've already seen the iSight indicator light " disappear " behind the bezel of Apple 's MacBook and iMac computers .
A recently published patent application could make the iSight itself not only disappear , but move to the middle of the screen .
MacBooks , iMacs , and even iPhones and iPod touches could take advantage of the new technology .
Submitted in July 2007 , theÂ filingÂ details plans for a camera mounted behind a display that could capture an image " while the display elements are in an inactive state ( in which the display elements are darkened and at least partially transparent ) . "
According to the document , a similar , additional system could involve two or more cameras , with software combining the two images into one .
Â
Video would also be possible by cycling the display " between the active state and the inactive state repeatedly . "
However , this does n't necessarily mean a ' dark spot ' would appear on the screen during photos , or even start flashing during video capture .
" In some embodiments , the mechanism is configured to substantially minimize the period of time in the inactive state to reduce the appearance of flicker of the display screen . "
The filing explains how today 's built - in cameras require a user to look away from the lens in order to see his or her video conferencing participants .
Â
" Constantly looking back and forth between the display screen and the camera ... can be distracting and make the conversation seem awkward and unnatural . "
This would appear to improve upon a similarÂ June 2004 filingÂ that involved many tiny image sensors wedged between LCD cells , and software to stitch together all of the smaller pieces .
In an image attached to the application , a cross-section diagram illustrates a focused " image - capturing mechanism " aimed at a user through the screen .
Another presents a MacBook with no iSight lens on the top bezel ( and apparently being used by a President Bush lookalike ) .
While rumors have already circulated for some time of what might best be called " iChat AV Mobile " for the iPhone , this proposed patent seems to confirm the very real possibility of such a feature for the iPhone , iPod touch , and even other devices .
" The display screen is coupled to a laptop computer , a desktop computer , a cellular phone , a personal digital assistant ( PDA ) , an electronic organizer , a media player , an advertisement - generation mechanism , a security mechanism , an automated teller machine ( ATM ) , an instrument console or control panel , or another electronic device . "
Other recently published Apple patent filings include one for anÂ improved laptop display housingÂ that integrates the familiar illuminated Apple logo behind the screen .
Â Another describes aÂ stiffening plateÂ for a laptop 's palm rest that would help save weight by making it possible , for example , to replace heavily metal - reinforced Superdrive housings with aluminum housings .
Apple has also devised a way to simplify the architecture within its iPhone and iPod touch devices , which currently need three chips just to interpret the touch sensor .
Â AÂ new single chip designÂ would be better equipped to lessen electrical interference and further improve touch screen response .

Key quotes from the main players during the conflict between Georgia and Russia over the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
19 AUGUST 2008 Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer
" Russia has to honour all points in the agreement reached by the European Union , OSCE and signed by President Medvedev and President Sarkozy .
That means - and we do not see signals of that happening - that Russian troops will have to withdraw now to their pre-crisis positions .
There can be no business as usual in our relations to and with the Russian Federation . "
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
" The [ Nato ] declaration above all appears unobjective and biased , because there 's not a word about how all this started , why it happened , who started the aggressive action and who armed Georgia ...
It appears to me that Nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim , to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime . "
17 AUGUST 2008 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ( according to Kremlin statement )
" From tomorrow , Russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting Russian peacekeepers ... [ Medvedev ] underlined the need for the unconditional and strict fulfilment by the Georgian side of the return of its military units to their permanent positions . "
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
" I hope he intends to honour the pledge this time ... people are going to begin to wonder if Russia can be trusted ...
Russia overreached , used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price for that because Russia 's reputation as a potential partner in international institutions , diplomatic , political , security , economic , is frankly , in tatters . "
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili
" One thing should be made very clear , Georgia will never give up any square kilometre of its territory , no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from Georgia , with the attempts to legalise ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring Georgia to the knees and undermine our democratic system .
" German Chancellor Angela Merkel
" Georgia will become a member of Nato if it wants to - and it does want to . "
16 AUGUST 2008 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , on implementing the ceasefire agreement
" First and foremost , this concerns the taking of additional security measures by the Russian peacekeeping contingent , which will be reinforced .
As these additional security measures are taken , there will be a withdrawal of units and sub-units of the Russian armed forces , which were brought into the South Ossetian conflict zone to compel the Georgian side to make peace .
It was the Georgian side that unleashed aggressive actions against the South Ossetian people . "
Letter from French President Nicolas Sarkozy to President Saakashvili released publicly on Saturday
" These ' additional security measures ' can only be implemented in the immediate proximity of South Ossetia , to the exclusion of any other part of Georgian territory . "
US President George W Bush
" The United States and her allies stand with the people of Georgia , and their democratically elected government .
We insist that Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected , and Moscow must honour its pledge to withdraw all its invading forces from Georgian territory . "
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili
" Russian army brought in a large number of irregulars , mercenaries .
They go around drunk , aggressive , armed and do all these atrocities .
The inability to give Georgia [ Nato ] membership action plan in April and even linking this with conflicts was clearly perceived by Russia as major sign of weakness and even from Russian point of view as appeasement of their worst instincts .
If the free world ¿ gives up on Georgia now , if the free world finally abandons us in this situation , I think this is going to have never - ending effects also for Nato countries , also for most of the European countries . "
15 AUGUST 2008 US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
" Georgia has been attacked .
Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once .
The world needs to help Georgia maintain its sovereignty , its territorial integrity and its independence .
This is no longer 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia ... when a great power invaded a small neighbour and overthrew its government .
The free world will now have to wrestle with the profound implications of this Russian attack on its neighbour for security in the region and beyond . "
US President George W Bush
" Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected .
Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century .
A contentious relationship with Russia is not in America 's interest and a contentious relationship with America is not in Russia 's interest .
Moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all Georgian territory .
Only Russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation . "
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
" Russia does not reject the principle of territorial integrity but its foreign policy will take into account the will of the peoples of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , who are unlikely to want to remain in the same state with Georgia .
If someone continues to attack our citizens , our peacekeepers , then of course we will answer just as we did . "
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
" I found some of Russia 's actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of Russian troops in Georgia proper is not sensible - and so I believe that the six - point plan must be realised immediately and the Russian troops should withdraw from Georgia proper . "
14 AUGUST 2008 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
" We support any decision taken by the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in accordance with the charter of the United Nations , the 1966 international convention and the Helsinki Act on security in Europe .
We do n't just support this , but will guarantee them , both in the Caucasus and the world as a whole . "
13 AUGUST 2008 US President George W Bush
" In recent years , Russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic , political , economic , and security structures of the 21st Century .
The United States has supported those efforts .
Now Russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in Georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions .
To begin to repair the damage to its relations with the United States , Europe , and other nations , and to begin restoring its place in the world , Russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis . "
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili
" We are living in an Orwellian world where the Russian Federation accuses Georgia of genocide and ethnic cleansing and meanwhile they are doing it exactly right now ...
There was a temporary ceasefire , that was the understanding .
From this morning there is large - scale movement of Russian weapons , of shooting , of armed incidents , rampages through different towns and villages of Georgia ...
Russian troops are in the process of completing ethnic cleansing of all Georgian - populated areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia . "
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
" The armed forces of the Russian Federation which were sent to South Ossetia to reinforce our peacekeeping forces , they will be withdrawn to Russian territory depending on the extent to which the Georgian troops go back to their barracks .
Our peacekeepers will remain in South Ossetia .
" The only change relates to the fact that Georgian peacekeepers , who were part of the peacekeeping contingent , but turned out to be simply traitors and cowards and started shooting at their colleagues - of course , they are never again going to appear as part of a peacekeeping contingent in South Ossetia . "
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
" This is not 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia , where Russia can threaten a neighbour , occupy a capital , overthrow a government and get away with it .
Things have changed ...
I have heard the Russian president say that his military operations are over .
I am saying it is time for the Russian president to be true to his word . "
12 AUGUST 2008 Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili
At a news conference after agreeing a peace plan with France 's President Sarkozy :
" The territorial integrity and belonging of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgia can never be put under doubt . "
Earlier , in a television address :
" We are working with an international community , but all we got so far are just words , statements , moral support , humanitarian aid .
But we need more - we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor .
" As you know the enclaves of South Ossetia previously controlled by the Georgian government and by local administration headed by ethnic Ossetian Dimitri Sanakoev has been ethnically cleansed by intruding Russian troops , and I get very worrying reports - some of them look to be unfortunately credible - of point - blank executions , on - sight killings , some people taken into some kind of camps or some internal places in Kurta and Vladikavkaz . "
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
" The security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored .
The aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses .
Its military has been disorganised .
" You know , the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them .
So you have to use surgery .
As for claims by the Georgian president that the ceasefire has been observed for two days - that 's a lie .
Georgian forces continued to fire at peacekeepers , unfortunately people were killed yesterday .
There was no ceasefire from the Georgian side . "
French President Nicolas Sarkozy
" We do n't yet have peace .
But we have a provisional cessation of hostilities .
And everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress . "
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
In comments by spokesman :
" We want to see the Russians stand down .
What we 're calling on is for Russia to stop its aggression . "
11 AUGUST 2008 Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili
" [ Russia 's actions amount to the ] pre-planned , cold - blooded murder of a country . "
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
" They [ the Americans ] of course had to hang Saddam Hussein for destroying several Shia villages .
But the current Georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 Ossetian villages from the face of the earth , the Georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly , which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them - they [ Georgian leaders ] are players that have to be protected . "
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
" The ferocity in which the actions of the Georgian side were carried out cannot be called anything else but genocide , because they acquired a mass character and were directed against individuals , the civilian population , peacekeepers who carried out their functions of maintaining peace . "
US President George W Bush
" Russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people .
Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st Century .
The Russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict . "
10 AUGUST 2008 Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili
" We are really seeing absolutely unparalleled situation since many , many decades in the world .
This is the most surreal world crisis I could ever imagine and it's very unfortunate that it is happening in my country .
I insist that it 's happening unprovoked by us , and I insist that it was all pre-planned . "
Russian Ambassador to UN , Vitaly Churkin
" Regime change is purely an American invention , purely an American invention ; we never apply this terminology in our political thinking and certainly we are all for democracy in Georgia , and it 's interesting that our American colleagues chose to bring up publicly this idea of President Saakashvili stepping down . "
9 AUGUST 2008 Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili
" This is 100 % , unprovoked brutal Russian invasion .
This is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders .
We on our own cannot fight with Russia .
We want an immediate ceasefire , immediate cessation of hostilities , separation of Russia and Georgia and international mediation . "
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
" Georgia 's aspiration to join Nato ... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures .
" The actions of the Georgian powers in South Ossetia are , of course , a crime - first of all against their own people .
The territorial integrity of Georgia has suffered a fatal blow . "
US President George W Bush
In a statement :
" I 'm deeply concerned about the situation in Georgia .
The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia .
They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis .
We have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand - down by all troops .
We call for an end to the Russian bombings , and a return by the parties to the status quo . "
8 AUGUST 2008 Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili
" Russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory .
This is a clear intrusion on another country 's territory .
We have Russian tanks on our territory , jets on our territory in broad daylight . "
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
" I must protect the life and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they are .
We will not allow their deaths to go unpunished .
Those responsible will receive a deserved punishment . "

What are these ?
“ A common gastric virus may trigger diabetes … raising hopes that a vaccine can be developed ” , The Independent has reported .
New research has found that enterovirus , which can cause vomiting and diarrhoea , can also attack cells in the pancreas and “ trigger the immune reaction which leads to insulin - dependent diabetes ” .
This study found evidence of enterovirus in the pancreases of 60 % of 72 young people who died soon after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes .
There was “ virtually no sign ” of infection in the tissue of 50 deceased children without diabetes .
These findings have raised hopes that a vaccine can be developed , but scientists would first need to identify which of more than 100 strains of enterovirus they should target .
Another recent study has found that a certain gene that plays a role in fighting viruses also protects against type 1 diabetes , supporting the suggestion that viruses could play a role in the development of the disease .
Although the first study suggests enterovirus could trigger diabetes , there were limitations , and its results will need confirmation .
This looks like a promising area for future research , but more studies will be needed to clarify whether an enterovirus vaccine might successfully tackle diabetes .
Where did the story come from ?
Dr S J Richardson and colleagues from Peninsula Medical School , University of Brighton and Glasgow Royal Infirmary carried out this research .
The study was funded by Diabetes UK , the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and Coordinated Action of the European Union ( TONECA ) .
The study was published in the peer - reviewed medical journal Diabetologia .
What kind of scientific study was this ?
This was a laboratory study that aimed to look for evidence of enterovirus infection in pancreatic tissue from people with and without type 1 diabetes .
Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body ’s immune system attacks the insulin - producing beta cells in the pancreas .
Genetics play a role in susceptibility to type 1 diabetes , but there are also ( as yet unknown ) environmental factors involved .
Past studies have suggested that enteroviruses may help trigger an immune response , which may lead to the development of diabetes , but the authors of this new report say that much of this evidence is circumstantial .
Through this new study , the researchers wanted to establish how commonly pancreatic enteroviral infection occurred among young people with type 1 diabetes , and whether their bodies mounted an immune response to the virus .
The researchers obtained preserved pancreatic tissue from the autopsies of 72 young people ( average age 12.7 years ) who had type 1 diabetes .
On average , these young people had developed diabetes eight months before their death .
The researchers obtained ethical permission to use this autopsy tissue .
The researchers also obtained various preserved control tissues from autopsies .
These came from five pancreases and hearts from neonates ( newborns ) who died from infection with Coxsackie virus ; 11 normal neonatal pancreases , three normal neonatal hearts , 39 normal pancreases from children aged 6 weeks to 17 years ; 11 pancreases from children with cystic fibrosis ( average age 8 years ) ; 69 normal adult pancreases , and 25 pancreases from adults with type 2 diabetes .
Again , the researchers obtained permission to use these tissue samples .
Thin slices were cut from the tissue samples , and special techniques were used to look for a protein found on the surface of the enterovirus , called the enteroviral capsid protein vp1 .
The researchers also looked for other proteins ( including PKR , which is involved in fighting off viruses ) , and other immune system proteins .
The researchers also looked for insulin within the pancreas , to identify those islets ( clusters of hormone producing cells ) that were still producing insulin , and those that were not .
What were the results of the study ?
The researchers found the vp1 protein from enterovirus in the pancreases of 44 of the 72 people ( 61 % ) who had type 1 diabetes .
But the protein was found in only three of the 39 ( 7.7 % ) pancreases from neonates and children who did not have diabetes .
The vp1 protein was present in two of the pancreases from the 11 children with cystic fibrosis .
When the medical notes of these two children were reviewed , the researchers found they also had diabetes .
Ten of the 25 pancreases ( 40 % ) from adults with type 2 diabetes contained the vp1 protein , which was also present in nine of the 69 ( 13 % ) normal adult pancreases .
The researchers then looked at where the vp1 protein was found within the pancreases of 10 children with type 1 diabetes .
These pancreases were of interest as they contained large amounts of the protein .
The vp1 protein was found in 78.7 % of the islets that were still producing insulin , and only 2.6 % of those that were not .
Further tests showed that the vp1 protein was found in the insulin - producing beta cells .
The researchers found that the anti-viral protein PKR was often found in the same islets as the vp1 protein : 87 % of islets assessed in patients with type 1 diabetes had both proteins .
There was no PKR in the pancreases of five young people who did not have diabetes .
What interpretations did the researchers draw from these results ?
The researchers concluded that the enteroviral surface protein vp1 is commonly found in the islets of young people with recent - onset diabetes , but rarely found in the pancreases of young people without the disease .
They suggest enterovirus may also play a role in type 2 diabetes , because the vp1 protein was also found in the pancreases of adults with the condition .
What does the NHS Knowledge Service make of this study ?
This study has a number of limitations :
The pancreatic samples were taken from people who already had diabetes , meaning it is not possible to establish whether the enterovirus infection occurred before they developed the condition .
In order for the enterovirus infection to play a role in causing diabetes , the infection would have to occur before diabetes developed .
The number of pancreases tested was relatively small , and results would need to be confirmed in a larger sample .
The study did not report whether the researchers were blinded to the tissue samples they were preparing and assessing , or whether they were aware of which samples came from which individuals .
Ideally , the presence of the enterovirus in these samples would be confirmed by looking for genetic material from the virus ( RNA ) .
However , this type of genetic material breaks down quickly , and is difficult to obtain from preserved tissue .
Consequently , the authors did not attempt this type of testing .
They suggest that their results need to be confirmed by looking for enterovirus RNA in fresh tissue from people with recent - onset type 1 diabetes .
Another study published this week has identified four rare genetic variants in a gene called IFIH1 that protect against type 1 diabetes .
This gene produces a protein that is involved in mounting an immune response against viruses containing RNA .
This finding also supports the suggestion that viral infections may help to trigger type 1 diabetes in susceptible individuals .
Although the study described above contributes to the evidence suggesting that enterovirus could be one of these triggering viruses , its results are not conclusive .
More research will be needed before it becomes clear whether a vaccine targeting enterovirus can tackle type 1 diabetes .

For those physicists and philosophers puzzled by nature ’s fourth dimension , Patrick Gill has a wry response .
“ Time , ” he says , “ is what you measure in seconds . ”
For Gill , that is a statement of professional pride .
He is what you might call Britain ’s top timekeeper .
Within the windowless – and largely clockless – cream - brick confines of the UK ’s National Physical Laboratory ( NPL ) , near London , Gill and his colleagues are busy developing the next , staggeringly accurate generation of atomic clocks .
These tiny timepieces are the devices that ensure radio , television and mobile - phone transmissions stay in sync , prevent the internet from turning into a mess of missing data packets , make GPS accurate enough to navigate by , and safeguard electricity grids from blackout .
They are , in short , the heartbeat of modern life .
These are momentous times for Gill and others like him in timekeeping laboratories around the world .
A new generation of atomic tickers , known as optical clocks , have just wrested the record for accuracy from the ensembles of oscillating caesium atoms that held it for half a century .
Soon , the new technology will be so refined that if such a clock had ticked away every second since the big bang 13.7 billion years ago , it would not yet have missed a beat .
That is an awesome accomplishment – but it ’s also a problem .
At this astonishing precision , we might have to rethink not only how we measure time , but also our concept of time .
For most of us , the closest we get to thinking about the nuts and bolts of time is watching the seconds tick away on a wristwatch or wall clock .
Thinking a bit deeper , …
Of course , Obama is not to blame for that situation , which he inherits , but it will be a pretty bad signal to see wind power decline significantly this year - and it would be an inexcusable one if that decline continues into 2010 .
The current stimulus plan does include measures to support the industry , but these seem oddly unambitious given the context of economic crisis and wind 's proven ability to create jobs and economic activity , to provide cheap power and to eliminate both carbon emissions and fossil fuel imports .
But for reasons linked to the inconsistent regulatory framework until now , and to the ongoing credit crisis , 2009 is likely to be a bad year for wind , with a decline in installations and , possibly , layoffs .
For the fourth consecutive year , the US set records in 2008 for the construction of new wind farms , with more than 8,300 MW installed in the year , making the country the leader for both yearly installations and , for the first time in many years , overall installed capacity ( nudging out Germany which has long been the world leader ) .
The sector created a record number of jobs at a time when few other sectors did .
First , the good news for the past year :
WIND ENERGY GROWS BY RECORD 8,300 MW IN 2008 The U.S. wind energy industry shattered all previous records in 2008 by installing 8,358 megawatts ( MW ) of new generating capacity ( enough to serve over 2 million homes ) , the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) said today , even as it warned of an uncertain outlook for 2009 due to the continuing financial crisis .
The massive growth in 2008 swelled the nation 's total wind power generating capacity by 50 % and channeled an investment of some $ 17 billion into the economy , positioning wind power as one of the leading sources of new power generation in the country today along with natural gas , AWEA added . (...)
The new wind projects completed in 2008 account for about 42 % of the entire new power - producing capacity added nationally last year , according to initial estimates , and will avoid nearly 44 million tons of carbon emissions , the equivalent of taking over 7 million cars off of the road . (...)
About 85,000 people are employed in the wind industry today , up from 50,000 a year ago , and hold jobs in areas as varied as turbine component manufacturing , construction and installation of wind turbines , wind turbine operations and maintenance , legal and marketing services , and more . (...)
Wind power 's recent growth has also accelerated job creation in manufacturing , where the share of domestically manufactured wind turbine components has grown from under 30 % in 2005 to about 50 % in 2008 .
Wind turbine and turbine component manufacturers announced , added or expanded 70 new facilities in the past two years , including over 55 in 2008 alone .
Those new manufacturing facilities created 13,000 new direct jobs in 2008 .
Massive job creation ; large turnover ( 44 % of capacity installation means more than half of turnover of the power construction industry , given that wind MWs are more expensive than gas - fired one to build - which does not mean that electricity is more expensive , as there is no need to buy gas to produce it ... ) ; significant carbon displacement .
What 's not to like ?
A very recent European study suggested that wind creates 15 jobs per MW built in the year of construction , and 0.4 permanent job per MW installed :
You 'll note that the US , with 85,000 jobs , was close to catching up on Europe , in just a few years ; with a lot more room to build more ( and cheaper ) wind farms onshore , there was no reason why the industry could not power ahead in coming years .
However , two things are endangering this : regulatory uncertainty , and the credit crisis .
As the above graph shows , the lack of consistency in the regulatory framework in the US has already killed the industry 3 times over the past decade : the PTC ( production tax credit ) , the main federal scheme to support wind , has been mishandled to a criminal extent - by being renewed much too late each time it was due to lapse .
This happened once again this year , with the PTC for projects built in 2009 becoming law only in November ( as part of the Paulson TARP ) .
Given that you need a number of months to build a windfarm , all projects that could not be completed before the end of 2008 - ie basically all projects for which construction could not start before last summer , were stopped until investors were sure that the PTC would be in place at the time of completion ( because the PTC drives the level of revenues for the first 10 years of production of a windfarm ) .
Construction decisions taken after the November resinstatement will only lead to projects being put in line much later in 2009 .
But , in addition to this instability , the credit crisis is creating additional difficulties , in two ways .
The first one is that the PTC was turned into money to build the wind farm thanks to investors willing to provide future tax payments from which the PTC could be deducted ; the most active investors in that market were the big invesmtent banks like Lehman or Morgan Stanley , who have either disappeared or have seen their profits ( and thus their ability to cash in PTCs ) disappear .
This has been solved to some extent by allowing utilities to get the PTCs , something they were prevented from doing until now , but it requires tweaking to investment structures that had been put in place .
The second issue is , of course , that the credit crisis has made lending a lot scarcer .
Wind , where most of the costs are upfront , in the initial construction investment , relies to a large extent on debt financing to make it possible to spread that investment cost over very long term power production volumes .
Such debt is a lot harder to find , and when available , is more expensive than it used to be .
There is no easy solution to that , although the proposal in the current stimulus plan to authorise projects to convert the PTC into an " ITC " ( ie a direct investment subsidy paid upfront ) will be a major help .
So the situation now is that we have an industrial activity which provides a lot of good things , but is handicapped in the short term by the consequences of past bad government and the credit crunch .
2009 will be a mediocre year , that much is pretty much certain by now , given that minimal lag time for projects , but it would be rather incomprehensible if 2010 did not show a massive turnaround .
This does not require massive subsidies , but a few small things :
an acknowledgement that wind is a large - scale solution ( not a silver bullet , not the only solution , but a good part of the solution to a number of problems ) that needs to be taken seriously and not just as a bone given to green groups to appease them ;
in turn , all that wind needs is a stable regulatory framework .
The PTC works , but it needs to remain in place for more than a year or two at a time .
State RPS ( renewable portfolio standards , ie obligations for utilities to produce a given % of their power from renewables within agreed timeframes ) work , but they create a patchwork of different rules across the country .
There is a need to provide a simple , consistent and permanent set of federal rules .
Personally , I think that a feed - in tariff ( ie a fixed price guaranteed to reneable energy producers ) would be best : it works , as demonstrated in Europe , and it actually reduces electricity costs for consumers when wind penetration gets high enough ( in the 5 - 10 % range ) ;
the main flank of federal action will be a long term plan to reinforce the power grid in a coherent and systematic way , in order for wind to be better absorbed into the system : this fits perfectly well with Obama 's discourse to invest in infrastructure .
But it needs to be done on a scale that makes sense - not just a few billion sprinkled here or there .
Just to avoid ad hominem attacks : I finance wind power and am not a disinterested party .
However , I do n't finance wind in the US , only in Europe and I do n't just finance wind : I finance all energy sectors , including oil&gas , traditional power and nuclear .
My job is to identify risks and weaknesses of projects and we would not be financing wind if we thought that it was not inherently sound to do so ; do note in that context that subsidies can make a project economically viable but they do entail political risk which we also have to take into account , especially when subsidies are high or politically contentious .
This is a minor risk for wind .
South Wales Police warned of an effect on routine traffic policing and major events A chief constable has warned her force will stop responding to accidents on the M4 from April - unless dedicated traffic officers are introduced .
Barbara Wilding said South Wales Police faced a £ 14 m " worst case scenario " funding shortfall and could no longer afford routine traffic patrols .
Ms Wilding also said that without more funds she would have to charge major event promoters full policing costs .
These would include pop concerts , football and rugby matches .
Royal visits could also be scaled back .
Ms Wilding said with precept funding , raised from the council tax , the force was facing a " worst case scenario " of a £ 14 m funding deficit .
Speaking to BBC
Wales , Ms Wilding said she had been telling senior assembly government ministers for two years that the force would be facing cuts in the services it delivers without more money , but to no avail .
The assembly government warned that police authorities had to be efficient and the minister did not expect " unreasonable council tax increases " to be imposed on the " already hard - pressed householder " .
Ms Wilding said the work of dealing with accidents , directing traffic and clearing debris should either be done by new traffic officers from the Highways Agency , or be funded through extra money for policing .
" We will be building a business case to the Welsh Assembly Government to say if you want us to carry on policing the motorway , responding to those issues , then you must pay for it , " said Ms Wilding .
" If you do n't pay for it , we will no longer be doing it . "

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Later in a statement , she said police would still attend collisions but not routine traffic incidents - which were already dealt with by Highways Agency officials in England .
" I would ask the public a simple question , would they rather my officers pursue the culprits of a burglary or sat in their motorway patrol car waiting for a truck to have its flat tyre changed ?
" It 's about using our specialist resources in the most appropriate way .
For every hour the M4 is closed , it costs the public of south Wales , £ 1m . "
Ms Wilding also said that without funding increases , she would be forced to charge promoters of major events in Cardiff , such as rugby matches and pop concerts , the full policing costs .
She also suggested the number of events during royal visits to south Wales may have to be scaled back due to pressures on her budget .
" We will start charging for the major events , we will have to , because at the moment , our policing levels are going down to 1974 figures , " she said .
Ms Wilding gave an example of the recent Cardiff versus Swansea football match , which she said cost £ 250,000 to police , for which South Wales Police received only £ 25,000 from the event promoters .
The chief constable also called for South Wales Police to be paid an extra £ 1 m by the assembly government in recognition of the costs of policing the capital city of Wales , as happens in Scotland .
Police on duty at the Cardiff v Arsenal FA Cup tie in January
" The implications are quite simple really , that if football clubs or people putting on events with pop stars are not able to pay for the level of policing that we say is needed for that event , on risk - it 's all done on risk - then they may have to consider whether they can run the event in the first place , " she said .
" And that , of course , has a huge impact on the economy of hotels , shops , transport , the whole thing . "
At a meeting of the South Wales Police Authority , Ms Wilding also urged members to agree a 9.8 % increase in the amount council tax payers are charged for policing so patrols of the M4 could continue .
The Welsh Assembly Government said police funding was a matter for the Home Office , with South Wales and Gwent police forces legally responsible for policing the M4 in south Wales .
A spokesman said a transfer of certain powers to highways agencies to improve efficiency of road policing and to free up officers for law enforcement had already been proposed .
The trial of a rapid response system for the M4 and A55 was also subject to discussion , while two traffic management centres for the same roads had been funded .
On the policing of major events , the spokesman said South Wales Police Authority was funded by a formula based on need , which took into account special events .
" All local authorities including police authorities should manage their resources as effectively and efficiently as possible , " said the spokesman .
" The minister will monitor carefully budget setting in the coming weeks and does not expect authorities to seek unreasonable council tax increases from the already hard pressed householder .
" The minister will consider using the capping powers available to him in the event of excessive budget increases " .
The Liberal Democrat local government spokesman Peter Black said the assembly government should meet Ms Wilding " half way " to resolve the issue .
" Both the Home Office and the assembly government are underfunding our local police forces , " he said .
South Wales Central AM
Chris Franks criticised Ms Wilding 's threat to stop policing the M4 as " frankly astonishing " .
' Free up the police ' The Plaid Cymru AM added : " It might be a good headline grabbing comment but is it responsible for the most senior police officer in south Wales to do that ?
" The reluctance of councillors on the police authority to accept demands for a 9.8 % council tax rise might disappoint the chief constable .
However , to lash out in such an intemperate manner is very unhelpful . "
Meanwhile , Ms Wilding 's calls for dedicated traffic officers were echoed by the assembly 's enterprise and learning committee .
Committee chairman Gareth Jones AM said Wales ' two major corridors in its road network - the A55 , and the M4 in the south - were vulnerable to congestion .
Any such jams went onto have " worrying social and economic impacts " , he said .

Morgan Tsvangirai is expected to be sworn in on 11 February Zimbabwe 's parliament has unanimously approved a constitutional amendment allowing opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to become prime minister .
The move allows a power - sharing deal to go ahead with Zanu - PF leader Robert Mugabe remaining the president .
Mr Mugabe is expected to sign the amendment on Friday and Mr Tsvangirai is due to be sworn in on 11 February .
The power - sharing deal was agreed in September 2008 but has been mired by bitter disputes .
Last week , southern African leaders , who have been mediating the deal , persuaded Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) to join a joint administration despite their concerns over Zanu - PF 's commitment to sharing power .
The unity government is intended to ease Zimbabwe 's economic meltdown but correspondents say this is largely dependent on the restoration of foreign aid and investment .
Donors say they will only restore aid when the government is working efficiently and equally .
' Miracle ' Zimbabwean journalist Brian Hungwe told the BBC that all 184 MPs and 72 senators had approved the bill .
Reuters news agency reports that the vote was greeted with jubilation and stomping of feet by MPs from both parties in the lower house - in a rare show of unity .
It is important to establish trust from the word go
MDC's Tendai Biti
Relief and trepidation in Harare
As the amendment was tabled in the lower house , the MDC 's chief negotiator Tendai Biti told MPs it was a feat that the rivals had come so far .
" Everything has happened on the negotiating table other than physical confrontation .
It is a miracle that we are here , " AFP news agency quotes him as saying .
Correspondents say Mr Biti arrived in parliament after a morning in court relating to his treason charges .
His trial was set for 4 May .
He is accused of announcing March 's presidential poll result before the official electoral body , which took more than a month to make its announcement , as well as publishing false statements and insulting the president .
The MDC says the results were rigged .
" We go into this government knowing that for this to work there has to be commitment , " he told MPs .
" It is important to establish trust from the word go . "
Wrangling Last week , the MDC agreed to a new timetable proposed by the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) .
The months of wrangling between Zanu - PF and MDC have centred on how the most powerful cabinet posts were to be shared out - especially that of the Home Affairs ministry which controls the police .
Robert Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly 29 years Negotiators are still trying to hammer out who gets what ahead of the unity government taking over on 13 February .
Another stumbling block had been attacks on and abduction of opposition and human right activists after the September deal - and Mr Tsvangirai still insists political abductees must be released .
Zimbabwe is enduring rampant inflation and an escalating food crisis .
An outbreak of cholera , fuelled by the collapse of infrastructure , has now infected nearly 66,000 people and killed more than 3,300 .
Mr Tsvangirai won the first round of presidential elections last March , but pulled out of a run-off against Mr Mugabe in June , citing state - sponsored violence against his supporters .

1) Security Habits
2 ) Install a home alarm .
3 ) Have a reinforced security door .
4 ) Install a high iron fence around the perimeter .
5 ) Install motion detecting lights around the house .
6 ) Out of sight out of mind .
7 ) If you have lots of windows and doors to cover
8 ) Bullet proof glass would be nice but it ’s expensive ,
9 ) Forgot to mention it in point 1 ) .
10 ) Things to keep handy next to your bed :
I posted about this in the Spanish blog and though I should start one here as well .
Think we ’ve been discussing awareness and personal self defense issues enough and it would be nice to get into serious preventive security measures you guys could check and maybe try to improve this weekend .
Many of the cases of burglaries and home invasions occur because people failed at some of the points I ’ll cover here .
So lets to this into the usual list , ok ?
I ’ve written several times about my neighbor and the violent home invasions she suffered .
Still , she keeps making the same mistakes , and keeps paying for that .
She has bushes that provide cover to would be ambushers , she has poor lighting on the front door , she comes back home vary late at night , waking everyone and making lots of noise and talking very laud .
Overall , sloppy security .
- Very basic , but most common mistake : Keep doors and windows shut .
- Do n’t stay chitchatting with people in the front door , better to go talk inside .
Entering and exiting the home is the most dangerous moment .
- Do n’t let ANYONE into your home , until sure .
Keep that door closed .
Seriously , call the cop , phone company , or whomever it is knocking and check to make sure .
They ’ll try to rush you .
Do n’t let them .
Take your time , think .
If its the cops then they wont mind if you call 911 , if they do n’t like you making the call then hurry up doing it .
This does n’t go just for you , your wife / husband should also fallow these security habits and the children two .
Keep in mind that they are the ones more likely to make such a mistake .
-Careful on the phone and the net .
Dotn give away your personal information .
We ’ve all seen what happened with Face book , criminals using it to profile victims .
Fake phone interviews or contests may be used too .
- You obviously need to open the windows regularly to ventilate and let fresh air in , but try to do so with 2nd floor windows or windows that have bars installed , since these are potential entry points .
- Loose lips sink ships .
Telling friends about trips you ’ll be making ( empty home ) or cars or property sold recently ( money at home ) can end up being commented to the wrong person or simply overheard , you never know .
Better to be very cautious about what you tell to who , and if that person can control himself from telling the entire planet about it .
A loud one .
One that preferably calls the local cops or calls you on the cell .
Motions sensors and contact magnets .
Some models allow you to monitor what going on through internet , some can be connected with your smoke detector .
Make sure it has a backup power supply and if you can afford it an independent cell phone connected and all kept hidden in case they cut the phone lines .
Get a “ panic ” silent option button installed as well , in case you are being taken hostage .
This can be done in most modern alarms .
Its not hard to do yourself , but if not better get professionals install it . “ alarm ” or some other sign outside will already warn would be robbers .
They ’ll go looking for easier targets .
Bulletproof if you can afford it , it will be money well spent .
Have a peep hole as backup to your TV camera intercom .
Many home invasions just occur by kicking the door down .
Most doors cant stand a couple good kicks .
Let alone a few blows with a sledge hammer or a prybar .
Expensive , but knowing what I know it ’s one of the few things I can say is really worth it ’s weight in gold when there ’s serious crime problems .
If not build a 7 feet high wall , but you need a secured perimeter as your first line of defense .
I ’d take the time to build a brick or stone wall myself if I had to , but secure that perimeter .
Grating doors and bars on windows are also precious .
Specially in windows that are somewhat concealed and a criminal could spend some time busting through it .
In most places here in Argentina , windows have bars .
It ’s just common sense .
These will go on when the bad guy tries to sneak in .
You guys in USA also have game cameras for filming deer I believe , that start filming when the motion detector is triggered .
This is a very good idea to keep footage of any burglar or trespasser .
Make sure there ’s no places like low walls or vegetation where criminals can hide and ambush you .
Either fill that space with thorny bush or find some other solution , but do n’t leave any dangerous spot unattended .
Do n’t leave windows wide opened showing off your 50 ” TV .
Curtain arent just for looks . , try moving the furniture around to make access more complicated .
I have a small cart - thing that is full of crystal glasses and garbage like that .
Make a lot of noise if moved and all that glass braking would make a lot of noise , so my wife placed it against a back door just in case .
Lamps , etc , anything that would fall when someone that does n’t know opens the door to force his way in .
It will give you time to grab your gun or they may just leave after realizing all the noise they just made .
storm or security window film on the other hand is pretty darn cheap and would make a nice weekend project .
The average burglar will just throw a stone or hit the window with a pipe and that ’s that .
The security films gives you more , time , it will confuse the robbers , not to mention , protect the people inside form shattered glass .
Definitely something to look into given the low price / neat level of protection relationship .
When there ’s an intruder , the kids must know that they should immediately go to the master bedroom , and the wife should know at least how to fire a gun ( another handgun for the wife ) Very smart people advice to call the cops and everyone wait in the master bedroom .
I ’m not that bright .
I know my house very well and can move around it better than some stranger .
Besides , I ’m not going to wait there until the bad guys decide to come into the room and bring the gunfight to where my family is .
I ’d rather handle it away from them .
The important point is , your kids and wife should be in one place when your move around the house looking for the bad guys .
Remember to speak out loud and verify before walking back into the master bedroom .
You do n’t want your wife to open fire on you .
Also , know that most walls in USA wont stop bullets , so expect them to go right through .
glasses ( if you use them , get LASIK ! ) , a high Lumen flashlight , gun , spare gun for the wife , long gun ( shotgun / short rifle ) charged cell phone , and if you are clever , you ’ll have body armor .
If you can't have guns get a short machete , big kitchen knife , any kind of weapon at all , but do get one .
A small hatchet or axe can do a lot of damage .
Blunt weapons arent ass efective , I much prefer something that cuts .
Guy , any other advice or suggestion would be welcomes .
The economy crisis will bring along higher crime rates and people would to well to prepare for that .
FerFAL
That subpoena from John Conyers seems to be making Karl Rove a little more ... clenched these days .
Appearing with the ever - friendly Bill O'Reilly last night , he dismissed the possibility he would even consider appearing for the legal summons :
Rove : I have been directed , again on January 16 , by the outgoing president 's legal counsel , not to respond to a subpoena , exerting privilege on behalf of the former president and his close aides .
O'Reilly :
So you 're not even going to show ?
Rove : No , and -- O'Reilly :
What if they hold you in contempt of Congress ?
Rove : Look , this issue is -- let 's step back for a minute .
This issue of whether or not I should show up -- I 've never exerted any personal privilege , I 've never said I have a personal right not to show up .
O'Reilly : No , but you 're a counselor to the president , it 's executive -- I got all that .
But let 's go beyond the argument .
I know your argument .
Say Conyers says Mr. Rove is in contempt of Congress .
What happens then ?
Rove : Well , look , this issue is before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia .
Rep .
Conyers could have waited until they resolved the issue one way or the other , gave guidance to him and gave guidance to the former president and to the current president .
But instead , he decided to go forward with this -- I do n't know if I want to call it a witch hunt , I do n't think of myself as a witch , but I 'm certain -- this is a guy who went to the cloak room and said , ' Somebody has to get his --' and then filled in a crude way to describe my posterior .
He 's sort of like Captain Ahab and I 'm the whale .
Well , we know President Obama is n't keen on Conyers proceeding , but this indeed is n't just about petty revenge , as O'Reilly and Rove want to pretend .
There are in fact much bigger issues at stake here :
PLEASE NOTE : C&L realizes that Karl Rove is not well - liked here for a great many reasons .
Remember that wishing physical harm on anyone when you leave a comment here is against the commenting policy and will be deleted .
You folks know better .
- Sitemonitor
At issue is whether presidential advisers can be compelled to testify before Congress .
Chairman Conyers wants Mr. Rove to appear before his panel to answer questions on the 2006 firings of US attorneys , prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman ( D ) , and “ politicization of the Department of Justice . ”
The panel also wants the Obama administration to release relevant documents from the Bush administration bearing on these issues .
The legal issues for the new administration are highly controversial , but both the White House and the Democrat - controlled Congress have laid the groundwork for a shift in policy from the Bush administration over executive privilege , which was frequently invoked in the Bush years in clashes with the Congress .
Rove was n't clear last night whether he will be making a simple claim of executive privilege or will attempt , as he has in the past , to assert an " absolute immunity " that is not only novel but clearly counter to court rulings on the matter .
Marcy
Wheeler at emptywheel recently explored this in some detail , noting that a simple executive - privilege would seem unlikely to stand up in this case , while the latter claim flies in the face of the Supreme Court rulings establishing the parameters of executive privilege .
After all , the key ruling in this matter , U.S. v. Nixon , is quite clear :
To read the Article II powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and nondiplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of ' a workable government ' and gravely impair the role of the courts under Article III .
Meanwhile , it 's also worth noting that Don Siegelman is mightily pleased .
This is incredible : Australia has eliminated the risk of large measles outbreaks for the next few years .
At least , this is the prediction based on past cases , and by lowering the age for children to get the second inoculation from four years old to 18 months .
In 2005 and 2007 , Australia had less than one case per million people .
2006 had an uptick with 6 cases per million , but half those cases are claimed to be attributed to an " outbreak linked to the tour of a foreign spiritual group " .
Spiritual group , eh? Hmmm .
Antivaxxers ?
Bet on it .
So it 's predicted that large outbreaks will be eliminated .
They 'll have fewer than 100 cases per year across the continent , and those will be due to unvaccinated foreigners , who love to ruin everyone 's day .
The key here is to maintain the number of people getting the second shot , so that herd immunity rules the day and outbreaks are minimized or eliminated .
Australians continue to amaze me .
They do seem to be infected with our own nuttiness -- creationism is getting a toehold there , for example , and homeopathy is a plague -- but in general they seem to be a pragmatic and bonzer group of blokes .
Australia : good on ya !
Tip o' the syringe to Dr. Joe Albietz .
To bolster the fortunes of his leftist Party of Democratic Revolution and to further his own dream of becoming the country ’s president in 2012 , Mr. Ebrard has pushed to legalize abortion and gay civil unions in the capital and crack down on illegal street vendors and unlicensed taxi operators , who have long been associated with crowds and crime .
His plan to expand subway and bus service is ambitious and popular .
Image Mexico Citys government is offering poor men 60 and over free Viagra .
 Everyone has the right to be happy ,  the mayor said .
Credit ... David Rochkind for The New York Times
In announcing the erectile dysfunction program in November , Mr. Ebrard , 49 , portrayed it as a way of bringing smiles to the faces of those who have reached the tercera edad , or third age , as Mexicans call the golden years .
“ Everyone has the right to be happy , ” the mayor said , noting that many of the poorest elderly people do not qualify for employer - based health plans and have been abandoned by their families .
“ They do n’t have medical services , and a society that does n’t care for its senior citizens has no dignity . ”
An estimated half of Mexican men over the age of 40 experience difficulties achieving erections , said Dr. Irán Roldán , a specialist in geriatrics who helps run the new program at Mexico City ’s Department of Public Health .
But the subject has not been one that many men have felt comfortable talking about before .
Getting men into public clinics with the promise of free erectile medicine , Dr. Roldán said , could help them get treatment for other related health problems , like diabetes , hypertension , obesity and depression .
“ This is a public health problem , ” she said .
So far , huge crowds have not turned out for the free Viagra , Levitra or Cialis , which are the three tablets being offered .
Fewer than 100 inquiries have been made at health clinics and only about a dozen or so men whose erectile dysfunction has been diagnosed have begun the process to get the pills , health officials say .
They range in age from their early 60s to 82 .

In three separate ceremonies in the three capitals on Dec. 17 , 1992 , President Bush , Mexican President Salinas , and Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney signed the historic North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .
The framework agreement proposed to eliminate restrictions on the flow of goods , services , and investment in North America .
The House of Representatives approved NAFTA , by a vote of 234 to 200 on November 17 , 1993 , and the Senate voted 60 to 38 for approval on November 20 .
It was signed into law by President Clinton on December 8 , 1993 , and took effect on January 1 , 1994 .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_...
The agreement was initially pursued by conservative governments in the United States and Canada supportive of free trade , led by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , U.S. President George H. W. Bush , and the Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
The three - nation NAFTA was signed during December 1992 , pending its ratification by the legislatures of the three countries .
There was considerable opposition in all three countries , but in the United States it was able to secure passage after Bill Clinton made its passage a major legislative initiative in 1993 .
During his presidential campaign he had promised to review the agreement , which he considered inadequate .
Since the agreement had been signed by Bush under his fast - track prerogative , Clinton did not alter the original agreement , but complemented it with the aforementioned NAAEC and NAALC .
After intense political debate and the negotiation of these side agreements , the U.S. House passed NAFTA by 234-200 ( 132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor , 156 Democrats , 43 Republicans , and 1 independent against ) . < 4 > and the U.S. Senate passed it by 61 - 38<5 >
Finally , Clinton sanctioned the ratification in November 1993 .
http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/nafta/nafta0401-04.htm
President Bush signed NAFTA in December 1992 , but sending it to the Senate for ratification would be up to the next president .
Facing stiff questions from labor unions - a core Democratic Party constituency - candidate Bill Clinton declared that he would support NAFTA if it included side agreements on labor rights and the environment .
There are MANY more references .
Just Google " Who signed the NAFTA agreement .
Poster Comment : I 'll be danged .
I thought Bush I proposed NAFTA and Clinton signed it into law .
Not true , apparently .
I was schooled .
OTTAWA , Feb. 17 ( UPI ) -- Canada 's immigration minister is considering cutting funding to a Canadian - Arabic group after being called a " professional whore " by the organization 's leader .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney told Sun Media at an international anti-Semitism conference in London he wo n't tolerate such remarks made by the leader of the Canadian Arab Federation 's president , Khaled Mouammar .

Mouammar lashed out at Kenney calling him a " professional whore " and alleged that Kenney was promoting Islamophobia after the Conservative minister criticized the presence of Hamas and Hezbollah flags at anti-Israeli protests in Toronto recently , the report said .
" This government is anti-Arab and anti-Muslim , " Mouammar said of Canada .
Kenney told Sun Media a federal grant of $ 447,297 for an Arabic settlement program in Toronto would be reviewed and possibly cut after March 2010 .
" We should not be rewarding those who express views that are contrary to Canada 's best liberal values of tolerance and mutual respect , " the minister said in the interview .

Men who develop prostate cancer face an increased risk of having an aggressive tumor if they carry a so - called breast cancer gene mutation , scientists from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University report in today 's issue of Clinical Cancer Research .
The findings could help to guide prostate - cancer patients and their physicians in choosing treatment options .
The study , involving 979 men with prostate cancer and 1251 men without the disease , looked at whether participants carried mutations for either of two genes , BRCA1 and BRCA2 .
Women carrying mutations in either gene face an increased risk of developing breast cancer , ovarian cancer , or both .
All the people enrolled in the Einstein study were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent .
The study focused on them because they are five times likelier than people in the general population to carry a mutation of any kind in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes .
The researchers looked for the presence of three particular mutations " two in BRCA1 and one in BRCA2 .
Scientists believe that genetic discoveries among the Ashkenazi can benefit society as a whole in terms of preventing and treating major diseases .
Having any of the three mutations did not increase a man 's risk of developing prostate cancer , the study found .
But for those men who did develop prostate cancer , two of the mutations " BRCA1-185delAG and the mutated BRCA2 gene " increased the risk that tumors would be aggressive or high - grade , as defined by a Gleason score of 7 or above .
The Gleason score , based on the microscopic appearance of prostate tissue removed during a biopsy or surgery , assesses the aggressiveness of a prostate tumor on a scale from 2 ( least aggressive ) to 10 ( most aggressive ) .
Specifically , prostate cancer patients with high - grade , aggressive tumors ( Gleason scores of 7 or above ) were 3.2 times more likely to carry the BRCA2 gene mutation than were men in the control group .
Carriers of the BRCA1 - 185delAG mutation were also at increased risk of having an aggressive prostate cancer .
Previous investigations into a possible link between prostate - cancer risk and the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have yielded conflicting results " perhaps because they involved small numbers of subjects and lacked well - matched control groups .
" Our large study shows conclusively that prostate cancer patients with either the BRCA2 gene mutation or the BRCA1 - 185delAG mutation are more susceptible to aggressive cancers than people without that mutation , " says Robert Burk , M.D. , professor of pediatrics ( genetics ) at Einstein and senior author of the study .
Routine genetic testing for BRCA mutations " done by analyzing blood samples or cells swabbed from the inside of one 's cheeks " would n't be justified for most men , says Dr. Burk : the prevalence of the mutations in the general population is very low ; and men with high Gleason scores already know that their prostate cancer is aggressive .
But , notes Dr. Burk , " our findings might have practical implications for some men diagnosed with early - stage ( low Gleason score ) prostate cancers " particularly Ashkenazi Jewish men , who are much more likely to have these mutations . "
" One of the biggest problems with early - stage prostate cancer is being able to distinguish between tumors with the potential to become aggressive and those that may persist for many years without enlarging or spreading , " notes Dr. Burk .
For that reason , he says , Ashkenazi men diagnosed with early - stage prostate cancer might want to consider getting tested for the BRCA2 and BRCA1 - 185delAG mutations .
Knowing they have the mutation — and that their tumor may become aggressive — may influence treatment options that patients pursue .
For example , a prostate cancer patient who has the BRCA2 mutation might vote against ' watchful waiting '— in which the growth of the cancer is monitored and treatment is held in abeyance — and instead opt for surgery or radiation treatments with or without hormone blockade therapy .
For early - stage prostate cancer patients in the general population , knowing they carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation would also be useful , says Dr. Burk .
But these mutations are so rare in the general population — a prevalence of far less than one percent — that testing is unlikely to reveal their presence .

A number of court documents have been filed and then subsequently posted to the litigation page within the past two days ; some are important , others not so much .
I 'll cover the documents chronologically from oldest to newest .
The first document is probably the least important , but it 's worth mentioning for the historical value .
The Coleman campaign filed the first post - categorization motion essentially asking the Election Contest Court to reconsider their decision regarding categorization .
An overview of Coleman 's arguement is presented below ; the document was drafted on February 16th and then filled with the court on February 17th :
Dear Judges Hayden , Reilly and Marben : We write pursuant to Minn.R. Gen. Prac. 115.11 to request the Court 's permission to file a motion for reconsideration of the Court 's February 13 , 2009 Order Following Hearing .
We respectfully believe the Court has created a significant problem by adopting standards to be applied to the remaining unopened absentee ballots which are materially different than those which have been applied previously - by election officials , by recount personnel , by the Supreme Court and , indeed , by this Court itself -- to absentee ballots already opened and counted .
If the Court maintains the standards set forth in that ruling , it will serve only to further exacerbate inconsistencies and inequities in the process and the already - existing equal protection problem .
Let us explain .
...
On February 3,2009 , when the parties stipulated and the Court signed an order that all of the 933 ballots opened on January 3 , 2009 were " properly and lawfully opened and counted , " even though it appears scores of them do not meet these standards .
As a result , there are certainly hundreds , and likely thousands , of votes already counted that under the Court 's February 13,2009
Order were not legally cast votes - meaning that the recount included a material number of illegally cast votes which should not have been included in the totals the Canvassing Board certified .
In our motion to reconsider , we will provide specific and numerous example ballots to the Court so that it may under the statutory power granted it for this contest correct these inconsistencies .
We believe the standard this Court applies to determine which of the remaining rejected absentee ballots is a legally cast vote must be consistent with the standards this Court has already applied to other ballots as well as the same standard applied to the thousands of absentee ballots already opened and counted by the counties .
The earlier standards consistently applied include , as the testimony of county officials has made clear , that whether a voter had otherwise voted in the election was determined solely with reference to the roster in his or her precinct and that , among other things , many counties did not check the registration of the witness and some did not .
Moreover , the Court should consistently apply the same methods used by the counties and municipalities on election day to determine whether an absentee ballot should be accepted .
One thing is clear about American elections : all voters must be treated equally .
To apply different standards to different absentee voters is prohibited by the Constitution .
In light of these facts and circumstances , which the Court may not have had the opportunity to consider , Contestants respectfully seek permission to file a motion , with attached exhibits , seeking reconsideration of the Court 's February 13 , 2009 ruling .
Source : Letter Requesting Permission to File a Motion for Reconsideration via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The Coleman campaign presented a clever , yet reused argument suggesting that some ballots were actually improperly counted and should therefore be uncounted as to not disenfranchise those who voted properly .
This course of reasoning presents another angle to the Equal Protection argument while attempting to directly reduce their vote deficit .
Unfortunately for the Coleman campaign , the Election Contest Court denied the entirety of their request .
The full text of the order is presented below :
The above - captioned matter came before the Court. on February 16 , 2009 .
pursuant to Contestants ' request to bring a motion to reconsider the Court 's February 13 , 2009 , Order .
Based upon the contents of the file , the Court makes the following : ORDER 1 .
Respondent 's request to bring a motion to reconsider the Court 's February 13 , 2009 Order is DENIED .
Dated : February 18 , 2009 Source : Respondent 's Request to Bring a Motion to Reconsider Order is Denied via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
I do n't necessarily think Coleman 's premise is wrong , as there probably were improperly accepted ballots , but he faces the burden of proving this assertion .
It is just as difficult to check 3 million ballots for improper rejection as it is improper acceptance and I do n't think the Election Contest Court was prepared to order a full scale examination into Coleman 's premise without some empirical evidence .
I think its also worth noting that the 933 wrongfully rejected absentee ballots have been assimilated into the larger subset of absentee ballots and are not individually identifiable ; it would be impossible to reexamine only those 933 ballots .
The next document was filed by Franken and focuses on their opposition to the Equal Protection argument presented by Coleman .
The Franken campaign mainly asserts that the idea of Equal Protection applies to a lesser degree when absentee ballots are concerned ; they cite a 2003 ruling that established absentee voting as a privilege and not a right in the state of Minnesota .
The first and last paragraphs of the aforementioned memorandum are presented below :
Contestants continue to occupy this Court 's time and to delay the seating of Minnesota 's second senator with claims that already have been argued and rejected .
Contestants ' most recent attempt to advance their purported Equal Protection claim comes in the form of an offer of proof into evidence .
Contestee respectfully request that this Court accept Contestants ' offer of proof for purposes of preserving the record and confirm its prior rulings rejecting Contestants ' Equal Protection claim as a matter of law , both on substantive and procedural grounds .
...
On at least two , independent grounds , therefore , Contestants ' Equal Protection claim fails as a matter of law .
Additional independent reasons for its failure are set forth in Contestee 's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Contestants ' Motion for Summary Judgment , which Contestee incorporates herein .
For the foregoing reasons , Contestee respectfully requests that the Court accept Contestants offer of proof for appellate purposes and confirm this Court 's prior rulings that Contestants ' Equal Protection claim is deficient as a matter of law , both on substantive and procedural grounds .
Dated : February 18 , 2009 .

This next filing is more curious than important .
Ben Ginsberg , an attorney for Coleman , has asked the Election Contest Court to afford him a temporary license to practice law in the state of Minnesota ; Mr. Ginsberg is a member of the DC Bar , but he does not currently posses the credentials required to actively participate in the court room proceedings .
Mr. Ginsberg has often been present within the court room , but he has never been the empowered representation .
Mr. Ginsberg 's request to the court is posted below :
Contestants Cullen Sheehan and Norm Coleman hereby move for permission for Benjamin L. Ginsberg , attorney with Patton Boggs LLP , to practice before this Court pro hac vice in this matter .
This Motion is based upon Rule 5 of the General Rules of Practice for the District Courts , the accompanying affidavit of Benjamin L. Ginsberg and the files and proceedings herein .
February 18 , 2008 Source : Contestants Motion for Admission Pro Hac Vice of Benjamin L. Ginsberg via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
There is essentially no reason for this request to be denied ; three attorneys representing Franken presented a similar scenario and the court granted them their request on January 12th .
Assuming Mr. Ginsberg is granted his request , it remains to be see how he will contribute to the daily proceedings .
The final filing , and the most important , deals with King Banaian 's testimony .
The court finally reached a decision :
The above - entitled matter came on for hearing before the Court on February 12 , 2009 upon a Motion in Limine by Contestee to Exclude Testimony of King Banaian .
Counsel noted their appearances on the record .
The Court having heard and read the arguments of counsel , and based upon the files , records , and proceedings herein , makes the following : ORDER 1 .
Contestee 's Motion in Limine to Exclude Testimony of King Banaian is GRANTED .
2 . Any other relief not specifically provided herein is DENIED .
3 . The attached Memorandum is incorporated herein by reference .
Dated : Feb 18 , 2009 ... III .
Analysis [ from the attached memorandum ]
The only question that can be decided in an election contest is which party received the highest number of legally cast votes , and therefore is entitled to receive the certificate of election .
Minn. Stat . § 209.12 .
The Court will be reviewing all ballots presented according to the uniform standard contained in Minnesota Statues Chapter 203B .
It is irrelevant whether there were irregularities between the counties in applying Minnesota Statutes § 203B .
12 , subd .
2 . prior to this election contest .
The Court does not believe Banaian 's testimony would assist in determining the issues properly before it .
Source : Order on Contestee 's Motion in Limine to Exclude Testimony of King Banaian via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
I do n't really know if this decision inherently alters Coleman 's position , but we can at least definitely say that the King Banaian saga is over .
The issue may resurface during the appeals process if Coleman is unable to overcome the current deficit .
This order also marks the first occasion in the entire litigation in which a motion , by either candidate , has been granted outright .
The next step for Coleman may be the Equal Protection argument , but remember , there are still other unresolved issues ; the double counting issue still remains unresolved along with some other , more minor counting issues .
The court has focused so much of their time on the absentee ballot situation that the double counting issue has been almost entirely ignored .
The resolution of the absentee ballot problem may however lead to the resolution of the double counting issue .
The Election Contest Court will resume tomorrow and King Banaian wo n't be in attendance .
The government has collected less tax from businesses due to the recession
The recession led to a £ 7bn fall in the amount of tax paid by individuals and businesses in January , data shows .
Public finances , which usually rise as tax receipts come in , fell amid higher unemployment and lower company profits .
Government borrowing for the full financial year is now expected to exceed its own forecasts of £ 77bn .
The Conservatives said the debt burden would slow the UK economy 's rate of recovery , but the government said it was committed to maintaining spending .
Treasury minister Angela Eagle said : " What would be a disaster is to cut public expenditure now ... of course it 's important that we return in the medium term to sustainable public finances .
" But you make the situation worse if you slash and burn at the beginning of a recession . "
For the first 10 months of the financial year , total borrowing was £ 67.2bn , close to the government 's target for the whole of the year .
Robert Chote , director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies , said that government borrowing for the full year could be " nearer £ 87bn . "
The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) , which publishes the borrowing figures , also announced that the debts of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds will be included in the public finances .
It said this could add between £ 1 trillion and £ 1.5tn to public sector debt - between 70 % and 100 % of the UK's GDP .
And shadow business secretary Ken Clarke warned that the UK 's debt burden would only get worse .
The tax take is being hammered by the recession
Howard Archer , economist , Global Insight
Stephanie Flanders on the public finances " We 're beginning to measure the full extent of the the decline in public revenues , " he told BBC News .
Rapid deterioration
The surplus in the public balance sheet fell to £ 8.4bn in January - a month when many firms pay tax - compared to the £ 15.3 bn surplus in January 2008 .
Government borrowing now stands at 47.8 % of the UK 's economic output .
Last January , it stood at 42.2 % .
" It 's clear that public sector finances are deteriorating quite rapidly , " said Amit Kara at UBS .
As as well as higher joblessness and lower corporation tax , fewer City bonuses have also contributed to the lower surplus .
" Corporation tax revenues in January were nearly 25 % down on the same month last year .
And much of that may be gone for good , " said the BBC 's economics editor Stephanie Flanders .
The temporary cut in VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % has also affected tax revenues .
" The tax take is being hammered by the recession , " said Howard Archer at Global Insight .
And the next few months could see tax receipts falling further .
" Tax revenues were 11 % down on a year ago and the situation is likely to get a lot worse over the course of the year , " said Andrew Goodwin , advisor to the Ernst & Young Item Club .
Increases in benefit payments to those who have lost their jobs also increases the debt burden on the government .
Bank debt
The ONS said that it plans to incorporate the debts and liabilities of the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) and Lloyds Banking Group into the public finance balance sheet .
Spending will rise sharply over the coming months
Andrew Goodwin , advisor to the Ernst & Young Item Club
It said this could add between £ 1tn and £ 1.5tn to public sector debt .
But the full impact of the bail - out on the public finances will not be known until the banks are returned to the private sector .
" Profit or loss is what matters .
If there is a loss it will be a lot less than these headline figures , " said Mr Chote .
The government was forced to bail out RBS in October last year and now owns almost 70 % of the bank .
It also provided funds to smooth the take over of HBOS by Lloyds , and now owns 43 % of the combined Lloyds Banking Group .
The government needs to borrow money in order to raise funds to invest in the banks .
Despite the ever - growing debt burden , the government has made it clear that it will borrow more money if necessary in order to boost the ailing economy .
" Spending will rise sharply over the coming months ...
We expect the chancellor to be forced to make significant upward revisions to his borrowing projections when he presents the Budget .
" Item expects public sector net borrowing to rise above £ 130bn in 2009 / 10 , " said Mr Goodwin .

Advertisement Fifty people have died after a US passenger plane crashed into a house in Buffalo , New York state .
The Continental Connection flight 3407 was five minutes from Buffalo airport when it came down at 2210 ( 0310 GMT ) .
Officials said there were no survivors from the 45 passengers and four crew on board the flight from Newark .
One person on the ground also died .
It is not clear what caused the crash .
There was reported to be light snow and fog at the time .
TV footage showed a house engulfed in flames and the tail of the plane sticking out of the ground .
Officials said surrounding homes suffered only superficial damage .
Twelve other homes were evacuated around the crash site in Clarence Center , a suburb of Buffalo .
State police spokeswoman Rebecca Gibbons said that of those on board , " there were no survivors " .
The number of passengers is now thought to have numbered 45 , after it was revealed that an off - duty pilot was also on board .
Erie County Executive Chris Collins said there were three people in the house that was hit .
One died and the other two - believed to be a woman and child - managed to escape with apparently minor injuries , he said .
President Barack Obama said he and his wife Michelle were " deeply saddened " by the news .
" Our hearts go out to the families and friends of loved ones , " he said , thanking the " brave first responders " who tried to save lives and make the area safe .
' Dropped off radar '
The twin - prop Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft , operated by Colgan Air for Continental Airlines , was flying from Newark airport in New Jersey to Buffalo Niagara International Airport .
US media say a recording of Buffalo's air traffic control before the crash showed no concerns by either the controller or the pilot .
However , a minute later , the controller was unable to contact flight 3407 and asked other planes in the area if they could spot it .
It sounded quite loud , and then the sound stopped .
Then one or two seconds later , there was a thunderous explosion
Eyewitness David Luce
' The plane did n't sound normal '
In pictures : Buffalo crash
One airport official said he had been told " the plane simply dropped off the radar screen " .
Eyewitnesses spoke of hearing unusual sounds coming from the plane before it crashed .
" It sounded quite loud , and then the sound stopped , " David Luce , who lives 150 yards ( 137 m ) from the crash site , told the Buffalo News .
" Then one or two seconds later , there was a thunderous explosion .
I thought something hit our house .
It shook our whole house . "
He described going to the scene of the crash and seeing flames up to 50ft ( 15 m ) high .
" The house was already flattened .
There was no house , just a pile of rubbish and still burning , " he said .
Dave Bissonette , emergency control director in Clarence , described the crash as a " catastrophic event " .
" It 's remarkable that it only took one house , " he added .
" As devastating as that was , it could have easily wiped out that entire neighbourhood .
" The fuselage of the plane lies directly on the footprint of the house .
It basically dove right into the top of the house from my perspective , and again I am no expert on recreations , but it landed on the house , " he said .
Investigation Relatives of the victims have been offered counselling and support as they wait for news .
One of those believed to be on board the plane was Beverly Eckert , widow of Sean Rooney who was killed in the 9/11 attacks on New York .
BOMBARDIER DASH 8 AIRCRAFT
The Canadian - made Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 was delivered new last year Q400 is newest member of the Dash 8 family Twin-engine turboprop , mainly for short - haul flights
First flown in 1998 , entered commercial service in 2000 Her sister Sue Bourque told the Buffalo News that Ms Eckert had been travelling home to mark what would have been her husband 's 58th birthday .
" We know she was on that plane , " she told the newspaper , although she had not received official confirmation , " and now she 's with him . "
Chris Kausner , whose sister is believed to have been on the plane , was forced to break the news to his mother , holidaying in Florida .
" I heard my mother make a noise on the phone that I never heard her make before , " he told reporters .
Officials say the fire has been brought under control and the area has been sealed off .
An investigation into the accident is expected to begin at midday local time on Friday , when the site has cooled down enough .
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration are going to the scene .
Continental Airlines expressed profound sadness over the crash and said it was working closely with Colgan Air to " provide as much support as possible for all concerned " .

US President Barack Obama has lifted restrictions on federal funding for research on new stem cell lines .
Mr Obama signed an executive order in a major reversal of US policy , pledging to " vigorously support " new research .
Ex -President George W Bush blocked the use of any government money to fund research on human embryonic stem cell lines created after 9 August 2001 .
Scientists say the research will lead to medical breakthroughs , but many religious groups are opposed to it .
Announcing the new policy , Mr Obama said he was authorising a change " so many scientists and researchers and doctors and innovators , patients and loved ones have hoped for and fought for these past eight years " .
Opinion polls suggest most Americans support stem cell research , reports the BBC's Richard Lister , in Washington , but the National Right to Life Committee described the move as a " slippery slope " .
It has also been condemned by the Vatican .
" At this moment the full promise of stem cell research remains unknown and it should not be overstated , " Mr Obama said .
" But scientists believe these tiny cells may have the potential to help us understand and possibly cure some of our most devastating diseases and conditions . "
He invoked the example of the late Superman actor Christopher Reeve , who became a staunch advocate of stem cell research after being paralysed in a horse - riding accident .
Analysts say Mr Obama 's decision could also lead Congress to overturn a ban on spending tax dollars to create embryos .
That ban , known as the Dickey - Wicker amendment , has been in place since 1996 and renewed every year by Congress .
But Democrat Congresswoman Diana DeGette told the New York Times newspaper that several anti-abortion colleagues were open to the possibility of reversing the ban if this was necessary to help research .
Before signing the executive order , Mr Obama said he hoped Congress would act on a bipartisan basis " to further support this research " .
Stem cells are cells with the capacity to turn into any other type of human cell , be it bone , muscle or nerve cell .
One embryo can provide a limitless supply because the cell lines can be grown indefinitely .
But the use of human embryonic stem cells in research is controversial with some campaigners saying it is unethical .
The practice of creating embryos is routine in private clinics , but the ban put constraints on federal researchers even before the restrictions imposed by former President Bush , forcing them to use embryos left over from fertility treatments .
Correspondents say the policy change is part of President Obama 's pledge to make clear that his administration wants scientific research to be free from political interference .
STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY
Key sources for stem cells are adult organs or embryonic cells Adult stem cells are identified and separated from other cells Embryonic stem cells are removed from 5 - day - old embryos Cells are manipulated to stimulate them to take on a specific function Specialised cells may then be used to treat unhealthy areas BACK NEXT 1 of 5
Announcing his development , he described himself as a man of faith who had carefully weighed the implications of the decision , and said moving forward required a " delicate balance " .
Like Mr Bush , President Obama has profound Christian beliefs but he has defined the issue in terms of integrity .
To that end , he also signed a memorandum directing the White House 's science and technology office to develop a strategy for restoring scientific integrity to government .
And he vowed that only research meeting strict ethical guidelines would be allowed , stressing that under no circumstances would stem cells be used for research into human cloning .
" It is dangerous , profoundly wrong , and has no place in our society , or any society , " Mr Obama said .
Researchers ' freed '
The move to lift the ban on federal funding was welcomed by stem cell researchers but criticised by opponents and social conservatives .
Peter Wilderotter , president of the Christopher and Dana Foundation , praised Mr Obama for " removing politics from science " and freeing researchers .
President Bush and other social conservatives argued that the embryos are human life and therefore should not be destroyed .
Mr Bush twice vetoed congressional attempts to have the ban lifted .
Following Mr Obama 's announcement , John Boehner , the Republican leader in the House of Representatives , said the president had undermined " protections for innocent life , further dividing our nation at a time when we need greater unity to tackle the challenges before us " .

An assault on three government buildings in the Afghan capital , Kabul , has left at least 27 people , including eight attackers , dead .
In one attack , two suicide bombers detonated explosives at an office responsible for prisons in the north of the capital .
Five gunmen attacked the justice ministry and another suicide bomber targeted the education ministry .
The Taleban have said they carried out the attacks .
A spokesman said they were in response to the treatment of Taleban prisoners in Afghan jails .
Once again the Taleban have displayed that they have no respect for Afghan citizens or any desire to see a peaceful future in Afghanistan

Attacks spark panic
In pictures : Militants attack
The interior ministry said overall 35 people were injured .
The attacks come in the week the new US envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan , Richard Holbrooke , is expected to visit Kabul .
The international forces in Afghanistan condemned the attacks as " callous and indiscriminate " .
Taleban warning
Five gunmen attacked the justice ministry at 1005 ( 0535 GMT ) , Interior Minister Hanif Atmar said .
He said the attackers killed 10 staff members , two intelligence workers and a policeman .
The five gunmen were all killed in a three - hour operation he said .
Mr Atmar said that almost simultaneously two suicide attackers targeted the Prisoner Affairs Department in the north of the city .
Six policemen were killed there and 29 people wounded , the minister said .
He added : " At 1003 our ministry of education was attacked by a terrorist suicide attacker who was armed with weapons and suicide vests .
" He was identified by our security forces and gunned down before achieving his goal . "
At one point the justice minister was locked inside his office under armed protection .
There was constant gunfire there as police scaled the building with ladders to enter through windows .
Student Assadullah Jagdalak was inside the justice ministry and said he hid under a table when he heard shooting outside the building .
" Security guards started shooting and then the attackers responded by killing other security guards .
One got inside the building and started shooting , one guy got upstairs , " he said .
DEADLY KABUL ATTACKS Jan 09 : Suicide bomber kills five outside German embassy Oct 08 : Suicide attacker kills five inside culture ministry Jul 08 : Suicide car bomber kills more than 50 at Indian embassy ( above ) Apr 08 : Failed assassination attempt on President Karzai leaves six dead Feb 07 : Attack on US Bagram base leaves 24 dead Sep 06 : Sixteen killed in suicide attack near US embassy Sep 02 : Car bomb leaves 30 dead Salim Hayran , who works at the education ministry , told the BBC : " After I heard the firing I could see from my window people running and the security guards everywhere . "
The commander of Nato 's International Security Assistance Force , Gen David McKiernan , condemned the attacks .
" Once again the Taleban have displayed that they have no respect for Afghan citizens or any desire to see a peaceful future in Afghanistan , " he said .
The BBC's Ian Pannell in Kabul says there had been a warning that the Taleban were planning a high - profile attack .
He says the attack follows a number of similar assaults last year and comes at a time when President Hamid Karzai is offering to sit down and start peace talks with the Taleban .
The incident comes after US military chief Adm Mike Mullen said more American troops were needed urgently in Afghanistan .
US President Barack Obama is expected to announce soon how many extra US troops could be sent to Afghanistan , and has called for Nato reinforcements .
Mr Holbrooke is expected in Kabul later this week , after his visit to Pakistan .
Before he left for the region , he said Afghanistan would be " much tougher " to solve than Iraq and that he had " never seen anything like the mess we have inherited " .

Well , our array of omnipresent blinking gadgets has officially rendered us totally incapable of normal human action .

No words for this .

Lord Ahmed , 51 , was driving his Jaguar when he hit a stationary car in the outside lane of the motorway - Martyn Gombar , 28 , was killed .
Lord Ahmed , of Rotherham , had admitted driving dangerously .
Mr Justice Wilkie said : " It 's clear the dangerous driving had no causal link to the accident . "
The peer also faces expulsion from the Labour Party following his jail sentence .
A Labour Party spokesman said : " The Labour Party does not comment on individual cases , but under the party 's rules any member who receives a custodial sentence is subject to automatic exclusion . "
The crash happened near junction 35 of the southbound carriageway at Rotherham on Christmas Day 2007 .
Mr Gombar , who was Slovakian , was living in Leigh , Greater Manchester , at the time of his death .
By reason of the prolonged , deliberate , repeated and highly dangerous driving for which you have pleaded guilty , only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified
Mr Justice Wilkie
He had crashed into the central reservation , leaving his Audi facing the wrong way in the third lane of the motorway .
One motorist had already clipped his car and another had to take evasive action to avoid it .
The court had heard how Lord Ahmed sent and received a series of five text messages while driving in the dark at speeds of , and above , 60 mph along a 17 - mile stretch of the motorway .
Mr Justice Wilkie made clear the texting incident had no bearing on the fatal collision .
Sentence ' nothing '
But he added : " It is of the greatest importance that people realise what a serious offence dangerous driving of this type is .
" I have come to the conclusion that by reason of the prolonged , deliberate , repeated and highly dangerous driving for which you have pleaded guilty , only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified . "
Earlier , Jeremy Baker QC , defending Lord Ahmed , put a series of points of mitigation to the judge including the peer 's years of service to the community and the country .
The barrister also pointed to Lord Ahmed 's attempts to help Mr Gombar and how he took it upon himself to warn other motorists about the incident at some personal risk to himself .
Lord Ahmed will serve half of his sentence in jail and half on licence .
He was also banned from driving for a year and ordered to pay £ 500 prosecution costs .
Outside court Lord Ahmed 's solicitor , Steve Smith , said he thought his client had been used as a " scapegoat " by those attempting to drive home the message about not using a mobile phone while at the wheel .
He said he was launching an immediate appeal against the sentence .
He said : " I 've been with him .
He 's very philosophical .
He 's approaching it with great dignity . "
Members of Mr Gombar 's family said they were not happy with the sentence .
His cousin , David Cicak , said he was hoping for a long prison term .
" He could be out in six weeks , that 's nothing . "
Lord Ahmed 's barrister Jeremy Baker QC , described how the defendant came to Britain as a child speaking no English but built up a successful business and political career before he was made a life peer .
The barrister said his client provided an important function for the country both nationally and internationally , particularly in the field of inter - faith relations .

If it seems like technology and cartoon humor do n't fit as well together as crusty old millionaires and big - boob gold - diggers , it 's probably true .
The principles that drive tech innovation are based on a certain amount of hopeful enthusiasm that is hard to make fun of sometimes .
Many new gadgets focus on dry accumulative hardware developments that are technically dense and the personalities driving them are often , on the surface , quite serious .
But with a skillful drawing , a great cartoonist can find insightful humor in anything .
And often , the artist expresses commentary that can be more than funny .
It can be reflective , mocking , or brutally honest in a single panel of narrative .
As the Daily Telegraph once stated , what makes a great cartoon is that its " action and character must be read and recognised at a glance , subtleties and depth of meaning may emerge as the cartoon is studied . "
This year , the gadget world provided cartoonists with great opportunities to show the growing hold that tech has on our lives .
From Bill Gates ' retirement to the global launch of the iPhone 3G , the cartoonists were there , ready to comment with a stencil and a knowing smile .
Here are the winners :
12 . Should You Buy a Smartphone or Gas ? , by Beeler
One of the biggest stories of the year was the record - high price for gas .
On June 20th , the average price for one gallon of regular gas reached $ 4.68 .
As a result , commuters cut their gas budgets and ridership in public transportation increased , leading to a huge spikes in bike sales .
In the following months , the demand for oil decreased and prices fell precipitously .
As shown in the cartoon , sensible budget - management led many to reconsider their own investments in high - priced gadgets , like the Blackberry .
But the Crackberry habit proved too enticing essential for the life of daily workers – it's still the top smartphone in the market .
Even Barack Obama has had a hard time letting go .
__11 . __Human Computer Interaction , by __Alexandr Zudin __( St. Petersburg , Russia , 4/12/2008 )
2008 was another year full of innovations in the world of robotics , bringing us ever closer towards the robot uprising .
This cartoon nicely portrays the growth of artificial intelligence as it is bound to our own intelligence .
It mirrors the continuing goal of electronic user interfaces ( as well as net tools like search engines ) to accurately match a person 's true intent , which is of course found in the cognition engine of the brain .
Plus , the cartoon is just plain creepy .
Check out our robot hand gallery from a few months ago to check out how close we are to bringing this cartoon to life .
__10 . __MICROSOFT and YAHOO , by
____Patrick Chappatte ( The International Herald Tribune ,
2/20/2008 )
Microsoft made a surprising and unsolicited $ 44.6 billion bid for struggling Yahoo !
at the beginning of 2008 and we spent the rest of the year figuring out when the Silicon Valley giant wouldfinally cave in .
The appearance of the company 's perceived helplessness and stubborn delusions in these cartoons shows how far the company 's fortunes have fallen in comparison to its rivals .
The toon suggests it has essentially become the bait in a power struggle where only one Big Dog ( or Pac - Man ) gets to eat .
NomNomNom indeed .
If this is resolved in 2009 , it will lead to a bigger question : Who gets to be Pac Man and Mrs. Pac - Man ?
__9 . __Rake The Leaves , Son , by
____Randy Bish ( Pittsburgh Tribune - Review , 10/13/2008 )
This year , the Macarthur Foundation unveiled a study that being on the internet is not actually a bad thing for students .
Turns out they told us what we already knew :
That social and technical skills are easy to develop online and that maintaining a permanent public record of your friends may not be such a bad thing .
Still , the generation gap between parents and kids who grew up on the internet is still big .
And chores will always be chores , no matter how high - tech we get .
8. Ballmer Can't Catch a Break , by
____Milt Priggee ( Puget Sound Business Journal , 6/12/2008 )
In his rule as CEO , Microsoft 's Steve Ballmer is trying to reach a few markets that are still within grasp of the company but that have gotten away from them just a tad .
One such service is in search , where Google controls the market to such a degree that it 's become a verb for the term .
Earlier this year , MS came out with a cashback program that allowed users to get rebates for purchases they make through Live.com , essentially ' tipping ' people to use their search engine .
It does n't look like it worked .
Maybe if they buy enough robot - controlled brain implants . . .
7. Cell Phone Ban , by Theo Moudakis ( 1/29/2008 )
This one is all about hypocrisy .
In 2008 , a growing number of states , including California , passed laws that made driving while talking on the cell phone illegal , unless you had a hands - free device .
The law arose out of the growing need for safety regulations and the growth of cell phone use .
the number of deaths related to cell phones is estimated to be about 2,600 a year .
But it 's not a full solution .
As the toon suggests , dangerous car incidents also occur because of a growing number of reasons .
Sleep deprivation , multi- tasking , drunk driving , and even stress contribute to many accidents .
__6 . __COLOR FAA Communication Flop , by __LarryWright __( The Detroit News , 8/26/2008 )
The disparity between the quality of the technology available in the private sector and that being used by the government became pronounced this year when problems with FAA computers delayed hundreds of flights across the country .
This satire plays upon that theme , but we also see the slow growing pains that the airlines are going through to provide better in - flight tech services , like wireless internet , while being tethered to an old - system that needs to change .
__5 . __Cell Phone Plans Runaround , by Angel Boligan ( El Universal , Mexico City , 4/22/2008 )
( El Universal , Mexico City , 1/14/2008 )
We found out this year that the telcoms are ripping us all off .
Oh , we already knew that did n't we ?
Recently , reports found that text messages cost carriers close to zero , and the huge bills from cell phone data plans and roaming fees surprised more than a few people .
Mr. Boligan told Wired.com he drew this cartoon as a response to the monopoly in different wireless communications enjoyed by many international telcoms , like Mexico 's Telcel .
4. The Joy of Tech , by Nitrozac & Snaggy
The Joy of Tech has always been good for a consistently hilarious approach to the world of tech , and Nitrozac & Snaggy did n't disappoint this year .
The Wii Fit system proved popular but many thought the game 's assessment of people 's fit level was far too honest .
But others , like Wired 's Chris Kohler , believe it 's good enough to put you in agood exercise routine , even if the challenges are n't that difficult .
As for the iPhone cartoon , it 's a self - explanatory depiction of an Apple fanboy 's tunnel vision when it comes to his favorite company .
3. The Dark Side of Google Chrome , by__ David Fitzsimmons__ ( The Arizona Star , 9/11/2008 )
This year , Google unveiled a browser after years of rumors .
But with all of its new features , like a unique rendering model and new V8 JavaScript engine , plenty of criticism also came with it .
Privacy advocatesfound that actions performed on the browser could be linked to your main Google account , which could potentially extend the company 's reach of personal information .
Gives the definition of ' Googling ' a whole new meaning .
2. Altered Gates , by Joy of Tech
Bill Gates retired earlier this year from full - time duties at Microsoft , and along with moving on to his foundation , he also created a think tank called bgC3 LLC .
But the project 's somewhat mysterious quality , along with the public 's fascination with one of the richest men in the world caused everyone to come up with their own ideas .
1. No Exit , by Andy Singer ( U.S. , various dates )
Andy Singer 's work is always acerbic , hilarious , and knowing .
We picked these cartoons among several good works throughout the year as the year 's best because they show a consistency of humor and depth and really , Singer just draws the funniest eyeballs in the business .

Thanks guys , and keep them coming for 2009 !

DAVOS , Switzerland ( Reuters ) - Businesses risk losing over $ 1 trillion from loss or theft of data and other cybercrime , according to a study released on Thursday by security technology firm McAfee Inc .
A computer server is seen in a file photo .
REUTERS / Valentin Flauraud
The California - based company launched the survey after detecting a rapid acceleration of malicious software , or “ malware , ” last year , CEO David DeWalt told Reuters .
Malware increased by 400 percent in 2008 , he said .
“ This was a very insidious type of malware that was designed either to steal your data , steal your identity , steal your money , and in many cases the scale as well as the sophistication was very alarming , ” DeWalt said in an interview at the meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
The survey of 800 companies in 8 countries showed that 80 percent of malware aimed to make a financial gain , in contrast to traditional viruses and worms which just had nuisance value .
In the survey , 42 percent of companies said that laid - off employees were the single biggest threat to their data security .
The increase in the availability and power of removable storage , such as mobile phones , laptops , and USB sticks , has made data loss or theft easier .
And global supply chains mean that sensitive data is often stored abroad .
DeWalt said the survey showed that the average company has $ 12 million of data stored outside its home country -- often in countries with little intellectual property law .
Data lost accidentally or through theft can be expensive to replace or damaging to a company ’s reputation or brand .
In April last year , discount retailer TJX said it would pay up to $ 24 million as part of a settlement with MasterCard over a security breach that put credit card data for tens of millions of shoppers at risk .
The British government has been repeatedly embarrassed by losses of data , such as when the tax authority , HM Revenue and Customs , lost data on 25 million people exposing them to the risk of identity theft and fraud .
Mississippi drug intervention Mississippi drug intervention is basically here to give an individual the appropriate resources to get an individual struggling with a dependency that does n't think he necessitates it into a drug or alcohol rehabilitation treatment .
It can be difficult for an individual to figure out when it is the right time to perform an alcohol or drug intervention .
It gets a lot less difficult when the individual has the wisdom to be able to notice the signs .
For example , usually , when individuals begin to be dependent to drugs or alcohol , their behavior begins to change , they sometimes spend huge quantities of their money , they do n't communicate as well or as much with the people around them , etc .
Lately , it has been noticed that people admitted involuntarily did not provide desired results .
That is why an intervention does n't condone using force to get to enter a rehab .
An intervention is simply individuals getting together to fight a person ’s problem and making him face the reality that he or she requires assistance . .
Help is a phone call away !

Mississippi alcohol intervention Alcoholism frequently generates this illusion that nothing is unethical in the life of the one affected by it .
But the fact that they do n’t observe it does not mean the situation is not dangerously wrong .
The people in the dependent persons ’ environment should react .
They have created intervention to make it less difficult for those persons .
It is very acceptable to have a lot of persons that know the alcoholic doing the intervention .
The individual struggling with an alcohol dependency must not identify beforehand the intervention .
The intervention a lot of the time makes the individual struggling with an alcohol dependency face what his addiction does to him and everyone around .
The whole point of achieving an intervention is to have the addicted individual enter an alcohol treatment .
That is why it ’s less intricate if the people have searched for alcohol rehabs that would fit the alcoholic .
Because an addict can be dangerously unstable , one should be ready to send him right away when he sees that he needs help .
An intervention is a very rewarding tool for the people that suffer from the person struggling with alcohol dependency .
Mississippi drugs and alcohol intervention Often , even when an intervention is achieved , the person struggling with a dependency does not want to go in a rehab .
A lot of the time , some time will pass before the individual can realize the extent of his addiction .
But even so , do n’t think that an intervention has not been useful , it may take a while .
Each individual will take their own time to notice that they need a rehabilitation program .
When the individual struggling with alcohol addiction calls you for help , you ’ll clearly realize that the intervention worked .
One of our counselor will help you make the right decision .

HTC and Google are getting closer to perfection with the new Android G2 , the HTC Magic .
Nice finish , great form factor .
Check out our video , including the obligatory comparison with Apple 's iPhone , and hands - on impressions :
Advertisement
The bad news first : Apart from my gripes about the user interface — which are still there — there is one but .
A big BUT , bigger than Ramona 's , the planetary lady with accidental moustache who serves the bocadillos down at one of the fair 's restaurants :
The software keyboard .
On this first touch , the keyboard felt cramped , probably a result of the screen size , which is smaller than the iPhone 's — which is the obvious soft keyboard reference , since it was the first one to implement a finger - touch software keyboard .
Advertisement
In addition to that , there 's an additional user interface problem , this time having to do with perception : Instead of popping up above your finger — like in the iPhone so you can clearly see what you pressed — the keys appear on the sides .
They flash quickly as you press them , and I found it extremely distracting .
They said that they put them on the sides not to obstruct the view , but knowing the over - the - key implementation in the iPhone 's software keyboard , it does n't make much sense .
Furthermore , when you are typing with one finger only — like I often do — you will be obstructing the view of the flashing key with your finger .
The reason :
When you type on the right side of the keyboard , the flashing keys appear on the left .
When you click on the right , they pop out on the left .
Other than this , the rest is great .
There 's a new Google Mail feature to delete or classify mail in bulk , as well as a faster camera , which now can take video — which obviously means you can play back video as well .
The rest of the interface and features is what you already have in the Android G1 .
However , what really steals the show here is the hardware itself .
HTC has got a very smooth phone , which feels great on your hands and in your pants ' pockets .
While it 's sightly thicker than the iPhone , the narrower , rounded body , and weight makes it feel the same size .
For sure , a lot less bulky than the G1 , which looks like a brick next to this .
And as you have seen in the shots , the final HTC Magic is quite pretty .
Have no doubt :
This thing alone will make many consumers put up with the less - than - ideal software keyboard .
Click to viewOverall , the first feeling is that we got a potential winner here .
If they can manage to make the software keyboard better , Apple will definitely have a formidable enemy in the Android G2 .
Sapphire crystals may be the next material to transform the electronics industry , thanks to nanotechnology researchers who have announced a new way of storing data that would fit the contents of 250 DVDs on a coin - sized surface .
The study , published in Science , illustrates how nanoscale elements can organize themselves over a large sheet of semiconductor film .
The researchers expect that when applied to electronic media , their discovery will improve the efficiency of data storage , savings which can then be transferred to improve other pieces of electronics besides just storage , like high - definition screens and solar cells .
Similar attempts have previously been made to improve data storage on semiconductor films , but have consistently failed because the polymers — which are known to link together , on their own , in precise patterns — lose their organized structure when the film being used increases in area , rendering them useless for storing memory .
Lead researchers Ting Xu from the University of California at Berkeley and Thomas Russell from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst overcame this by layering the film of block copolymers onto the surface of a commercially available sapphire crystal .
When the crystal is cut at an angle — a common procedure known as a miscut — and heated to 1,300 to 1,500 degrees Centigrade ( 2,372 to 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit ) for 24 hours , its surface reorganizes into a highly ordered pattern of sawtooth ridges that can then be used to guide the self - assembly of the block polymers [ Science Daily ] .
With this technique , the only limit to the size of an array of block copolymers is the size of the sapphire , Xu said .
Once a sapphire is heated up and the pattern is created , the template could be reused .
Both the crystals and the polymer chains could be obtained commercially , Xu said [ PC World ] .
The researchers say the technology could make nearly perfect arrays of semiconductor material that are about 15 times denser than anything achieved previously [ Reuters ] .
Using the technology , it might also be possible to achieve a high - definition picture with 3 - nanometer pixels , potentially as large as a stadium JumboTron , Xu said .
Another possibility is more dense photovoltaic cells that capture the sun 's energy more efficiently ....
The new technology could create chip features just 3 nm [ nanometers ] across , far outstripping current microprocessor manufacturing techniques , which at their best create features about 45 nm across [ PC World ] .

Sixty - three percent of people polled believe that ATM fees are a bigger waste of money than lottery tickets .
Thirty - seven percent believe the reverse .
~ Compass Bank survey , reported in " USA Snapshots " in USA Today
Just when I think economic literacy cannot descend to a lower level , I come across a tidbit like the one above from USA Today .
( Consider : With ATM fees you 're paying voluntarily for a service you receive .
With lottery tickets you 're paying voluntarily for , well , nothing ! )
It 's at times like these that I have no doubt that monumentally stupid ideas , like a bailout for the Big Three automakers , will get approved by the U.S. Congress .
Certainly , the fact that Congress is n't spending its own money plays a part .
Certainly , it makes perfect sense for an automaker to ask the government for money , since that well has been tapped before , despite the lunacy of such an action .
Just the Facts , Ma'am
Okay , so let me get this straight .
The Big Three Automakers — General Motors , Ford , and Chrysler — are in financial trouble .
This trouble is a result of [ basically ] not being able to sell the products they make in a high enough volume to generate revenue that is greater than or equal to their expenses .
Ergo , they are losing money .
( They are losing lots of money . )
If they keep losing money , one or more of these manufactures will have to declare bankruptcy or go out of business , which could lead to hundreds of thousands of direct job losses .
The failure of any or all of these firms could also lead to a substantial number of indirect job losses , as domino effects among their suppliers , many of whom depend upon the automotive industry , cause those suppliers to also go out of business .
I do n't think my synopsis is unfair or misses any significant points .
I also wo n't argue with the possible negative outcome (s ) .
I have little doubt that many thousands of normal , law - abiding citizens could lose their primary incomes from a crash - and - burn scenario in the U.S. automotive industry .
( The best and brightest of any of the Big Three could also end up at a competitor , making even more money ! )
First of all , any displaced worker wo n't be displaced forever , if at all .
Secondly , when a business is not meeting the needs of its clientele or when that business is mismanaged , it is supposed to go out of business .
This is what makes way for another business .
Thirdly , I 'd argue that keeping a bad business operating via State coercion , causes new businesses to be excluded from or limited in penetration of the market .
( I 'll talk about this technological and / or market exclusion , from which I think the Big Three massively benefit , later . )
Have a Heart !
One could debate this issue via all manner of economic logic , and maybe I 'll get to that later , but let 's examine this situation morally first .
Is it the responsibility of the U.S. taxpayer to make sure these automakers remain solvent ?
No .
Is it the responsibility of the U.S. taxpayer to make sure that people who work for the Big Three keep working ?
No .
Is it the fault of the U.S. taxpayer that the Big Three are currently insolvent ?
Yes , partially .
( That 's not a misprint . )
Taxpayers comprise the market and , of course , it is a market response that causes firms like GM to be losing money .
GM is selling stuff that people do n't want to buy , for whatever reason and so , few buy .
GM is supposed to be losing money !
Until and unless the U.S. automakers manage themselves in a way that : a ) creates products that people want to buy and b ) at a price that supports the expenses of the business , they should lose money .
That 's the choice that the market is destined to make , unless the government intervenes and screws things up .
( Yes , other issues are at play here , some of them further exacerbated by the State , but the bottom line is : A business is beholden to its customers , not the other way around . )
If the choices made by customers eventually cause a lot of people , people who previously made a good living dependent upon that business , to lose their income , those are simply the breaks .
Furthermore , this contraction is necessary for a healthy economic future .
( Peter Schiff covers this situation in wonderful detail in a recent LRC podcast . )
No customer is bound by any moral responsibility to buy from a particular vendor , no matter the eventual recipient of the profit that business generates .
Stealing Money and the Future Along with It
As I noted above , the debate about bailing out the automakers has both a moral component and an economic component .
One portion of the economic argument that I fear will get far too little emphasis is what I termed above as technological and / or market exclusion .
This is in my view , the biggest unintended negative consequence when the State keeps a bad business afloat .
Consider these points , made by Bart Frazier in a recent FEE column :
Think of what it was like 500 years ago .
Plumbing was almost nonexistent .
We burned trees for fuel or cut them up to make homes .
Our transportation was defecating in the streets .
Frazier continues :
We now heat our homes in an immensely cleaner fashion .
There is now more forest in Vermont than there was 100 years ago .
Natural gas is incomparably cleaner than energy obtained from burning wood and coal .
Who could have predicted the natural gas furnace 100 years ago ?
Who could have foreseen the advent of hybrid vehicles ?
The free market has ways to alleviate social ills in the future in ways that are utterly inconceivable to us now .
My point and I 'm certain I 'm not the first to make it , is this .
When the State keeps a poorly - run or inefficient enterprise running , it negatively affects the probability of some better approach gaining ground .
When so much of the technological know - how that could be applied to new approaches is soaked up keeping a poor one running , we all lose .
Simply put , it is as Manuel Ayau opines in his wonderful monograph " Not A Zero - Sum Game " : " Had we achieved job security in the Stone Ages , we would still live in caves . "
All Hail the Paradigm Pioneer
To examine this phenomenon more deeply , I 'll need to dig into the archives .
Joel Barker , in his 1993 book , " Paradigms : the Business of Discovering the Future " suggested that all paradigms have a lifespan that follows an " S - Curve , " a picture of which I show below .
A paradigm , using Barker 's nomenclature , represents an approach to solving a set of problems .
It can be a complicated methodology or a simple one .
It could encompass whole industries , or it could apply to particular competitors in a specific industry .
For example , how the Big Three approach the manufacture and sale of automobiles is a paradigm .
The internal combustion engine represents a vital construct in that paradigm .
According to Barker , paradigms are developed by people who are willing to take risks — " paradigm pioneers " — he calls them .
In the early days of a paradigm , immediately following its initial development — shown as Phase A — problems are solved at a modest , yet ever - increasing rate , until the paradigm reaches maturity .
Generally there are few people or firms applying the paradigm during the development stage .
It is unproven and frankly , the old ways of solving problems have a " stickiness " to which I 'll return later .
Recall that the car and internal combustion engine did not immediately supplant the horse and buggy .
At full maturity — shown as Phase B — more and more people or firms have successfully adopted the paradigm .
By this point , massive numbers of problems are being solved relatively quickly .
( And correspondingly from an economic perspective , massive profit is being generated , with all the commensurate lifestyles improvements as a consequence . )
For example , the horse and buggy eventually lost all market share to firms manufacturing cars , and society was socio- economically massively better as a result .
It is during Phase B , which can be quite long , that more and more entities apply the initial paradigm in new ways and improve it incrementally .
In Barker 's parlance , people who adopt this proven paradigm are " paradigm settlers " and they reap the rewards of the paradigm pioneer 's risk , while not incurring much , if any , of that risk themselves .
It makes sense to copy a successful approach versus invent one .
While Henry Ford can be credited with mass producing the first automobile , it did n't take long for lots of people to duplicate his approach , i.e. , apply his paradigm , and for many ancillary industries to grow up around the automotive industry .
Note that the operations of the Big Three differ from those of say , Honda or Toyota .
They each apply the automotive manufacturing paradigm in unique ways .
You Gotta Know When to Fold 'Em
Eventually , a paradigm begins to get stale — depicted by Phase C — and fewer and fewer new problems are solved .
Stated differently , and again returning to Barker 's premises , problems that the original paradigm did not solve , or that have been discovered during its implementation , collect during the entire life of the paradigm and eventually begin to cry out for a new solution .
It is inherent in the existing paradigm that these problems cannot be solved by it .
Unfortunately , those who have mastered ( and benefit from ) an existing paradigm are reticent to abandon it for something new .
( This is the stickiness of which I previously spoke . )
There is risk .
There is likelihood of failure as new ideas vie for supremacy .
The current approach is making money !
Market share is strong .
Stock price is high .
Why rock the boat ?
Despite the attractiveness of continuing to " dance with the girl you brought " visionaries and entrepreneurs will eventually seek new approaches to solving the collecting problems .
This is fortunate , because simultaneously , any sufficiently mature paradigm will eventually be old enough that it could fail suddenly .
( As well , the effects of the problems that collect during the useful life of a paradigm will eventually become substantial . )
Paradigms , particularly technological management paradigms , have a natural life and will therefore eventually need to be replaced .
The struggles of the Big Three automakers — particularly when juxtaposed against the success of Honda , Toyota , etc. — illustrates that their paradigm has gotten stale .
The march of progress is unending , and must be so for a society to continue to enjoy an ever - higher standard of living .
That is , unless there is interference from without .
You guessed it ; this is where the State comes in , generally to bailout those who are still riding an old , stale paradigm for all it 's worth .
New paradigms can also be squelched if those applying an existing competing paradigm can successfully mitigate the threat the new approach poses .
Most firms do this via actions like negative advertising , or , in the case of both the automakers and large firms like Microsoft , actual purchase of the competing idea .
If a firm is financially strong enough to do this , so be it .
The customer is still able to decide for himself , most of the time , unless the State controls access to the market .
Conclusion
Do you ever wonder why all those exciting concept cars — flying vehicles and other whatnottery — ideas conceived and presented decades ago , never seem to hit the market ?
Me too .
Yes , I understand that technological probability will almost always lag behind artistic possibility .
Still , I suspect that Manuel Ayau 's truism about the Stone Ages applies equally well to this discussion .
If the horse - and - buggy manufacturers had been bailed out , we 'd probably still be cleaning up behind our transportation .
Maybe I 'm being unfair , and maybe the Big Three have applied themselves aggressively to the seemingly interminable problems of engine efficiency , gas mileage , etc. but I wonder .
The entire environment that supports , not only the types of cars we now drive , but also , where we drive them and how we drive them , is rife with statist intervention .
And yet , these iconic car manufacturers need more help from the State ?
You 're kidding , right ?
Again , I ask a simple question :
If the Big Three 's paradigm appears to be reaching the end of its useful life , why should n't one or all of them go out of business ?
If the government swoops in — toting a gargantuan bag of stolen money — is it more likely to drive these automakers ( pardon the pun ) to solve old problems in new ways or allow them to keep on milking the same old cow ?
The answer seems obvious to me .
Even more obvious is this :
The Big Three struggle while other automakers make money .
Says Cato's Daniel J. Ikenson :
… the car industry itself is not in crisis .
Even if one or all of the Big Three failed , there would still be plenty of strong auto companies operating throughout the United States .
The Big Three currently account for slightly more than half of all light vehicle production and slightly less than half of all light vehicle sales in the United States .
I read a great quote in a recent Casey Research Update .
It comes from GATA ’s secretary treasurer , Chris Powell , who says , " There are no markets anymore , only interventions . "
That certainly seems to be the case in the U.S.
The unfortunate thing is , the average ( read : non-Austrian - trained ) citizen and the statist economic pundits who mislead him all seem to think we do have a free market .
Worse yet , they think that it is a failure of that market that causes GM and its cohort to need a ton of stolen money to survive .
At the risk of seemingly harsh , I can only offer one answer to such an assertion : B.S. ( As an interesting aside , one entrepreneur who would appear to know of what he speaks , particularly when it comes to the automotive industry , agrees with me ! )
The Best of Wilton Alston
Over the past few years , Washington , D.C. , has witnessed two explosive nonprofit scandals .
In 2005 , the board of American University received a letter from an anonymous whistle - blower alleging that the university ’s president , Ben Ladner , was abusing his university expense account .
A subsequent audit found that Ladner had indeed spent more than $ 500,000 of university funds on lavish personal expenses , including a $ 5,000 vacation in London and a $ 15,000 engagement party for his son .
Already concerned about Ladner ’s compensation — which was higher than those of all Ivy League college presidents — the board split over whether to reduce Ladner ’s pay .
The fracas filled newspaper gossip columns for months , sparked a congressional inquiry , and eventually led to Ladner ’s termination .
The board then required two years to rebuild itself and to name a new president .
Meanwhile , trouble was brewing at the Smithsonian Institution .
In 2006 , Sen . Charles Grassley of Iowa asked the Smithsonian to justify the compensation and spending of its secretary ( that is , its chief executive ) , Lawrence “ Larry ” M. Small .
In response , the busy Smithsonian regents trusted Small to oversee his own audit , and then passed resolutions that retroactively approved his spending .
Displeased , Grassley issued another missive demanding change at the organization .
The press soon buzzed with rumors of excess and impropriety at the nation ’s premier museum system .
The board eventually dismissed Small , but not before the mudslinging damaged the reputations of both the institution and the regents overseeing it .
Both scandals invited embarrassing publicity and congressional scrutiny .
Both exposed the governance flaws of experienced and well - intentioned board members .
And both could have been avoided .
As a trustee of American University from 1999 to 2005 and a member of the independent review committee that evaluated the governance issues at the Smithsonian , I watched as these organizations weathered their governance crises .
In both cases , practices that discouraged frank and frequent communication among board members left the greed of executives unchecked .
And in both cases , changes to these systems put the organizations back on track .
Yet the Smithsonian righted itself more quickly than American University because its regents ultimately reacted decisively and cohesively .
AMERICAN’S ERROR
In 1994 , American University elected Ben Ladner , a former ethics professor , to be its president .
Although American had only a small endowment , Ladner required that the university pay virtually all of his living expenses , which included salaries for a chauffeur and a cook , on top of his $ 225,000 salary .
He also demanded expensive renovations to the president ’s residence .
From the time he arrived on campus , Ladner ’s financial habits invited controversy .
For example , one student established a Web site to highlight the president ’s excesses .
Ladner unsuccessfully sued to have the site shut down .
Although most board members treated students ’ concerns as rogue complaints , a few spoke out .
Trustee Robert Pence questioned Ladner ’s spending in 1996 , for which he was removed from the audit committee .
“ I think I was asking too many questions , ” he said in a letter to the board .
Another trustee , Paul Wolff , repeatedly asked for a full account of Ladner ’s spending .
But Ladner did not provide the requested information , and the board continued to ignore early signs of the president ’s excessive spending .
Meanwhile , Ladner ’s compensation mushroomed .
In 1997 , then board chair William I. Jacobs renegotiated Ladner ’s employment contract without asking the board to authorize the agreement .
The new contract added lucrative incentives so that by 2004 , Ladner ’s total compensation had grown to some $ 880,000 — more than that of most university presidents .
Nevertheless , in that same year Ladner asked then board chair George Collins for an additional $ 3 million to $ 5 million in compensation .
An excellent strategist and communicator , Ladner had indeed strengthened the university , expanded its global reach , and improved the quality of both the faculty and student body .
But Collins knew that Ladner ’s request for more pay would anger many trustees , and so he did not tell the board about it .
At that point , the compensation committee became concerned that Ladner was among the highest - paid university presidents .
It also began to distrust his tightly controlled communication with the board .
As a result , the compensation committee retained the consulting firm Towers Perrin to conduct an independent review , which concluded that the highest reasonable compensation for Ladner was $ 780,000 .
Ladner attacked the consultant ’s credibility and persuaded the board to hire a second firm , Mercer .
Frustrated with Ladner ’s arrogant defense of his compensation and no longer able to support him , I resigned from the board .
After Mercer reached the same conclusion as did Towers Perrin , the American trustees quarreled bitterly over whether to reduce Ladner ’s compensation .
One group pushed for the reduction , while the other argued that Ladner was doing such a good job running the university that his earnings and expenses were reasonable .
During this debate , the whistle - blower ’s letter arrived , forcing the board to examine Ladner ’s expenses .
The trustees hired an independent auditor who uncovered the president ’s extensive spending of university funds and questioned his use of university staff for personal duties .
Ladner countered that most of the expenses were necessary for his position as the president and chief fund raiser .
Some board members continued to support him .
The deep division between pro- and anti-Ladner board members then turned destructive .
With the board unable to agree on what to do about Ladner , the anti-Ladner camp leaked the audit findings to The Washington Post .
Almost daily for the next few months , the Post published increasingly embarrassing reports about Ladner ’s compensation and spending .
Eventually , on Oct. 10 , 2005 , the board asked for Ladner ’s resignation .
Several board members also resigned over the controversy .
Meanwhile , the board ’s bitter public disagreements dimmed the interest of several candidates who might have succeeded Ladner , as well as alienated some very generous donors .
It took the fractured board two years to find Ladner ’s successor .
A SMALL PROBLEM
The Smithsonian Institution ’s board of regents similarly failed to rein in its spendthrift executive .
But when called to task for their oversight , the regents repaired their governance more quickly and completely than did American University ’s trustees , providing an excellent lesson in crisis management .
When the Smithsonian regents hired Larry Small to be the institution ’s secretary in 2000 , they were departing from a tradition of leaders with strong backgrounds in science and education .
The regents believed the complex and growing institution needed management discipline .
With a long banking career that included terms as vice chairman of Citibank and chief operating officer of Fannie Mae , Small seemed to offer just that .
Through his experience , Small had reaped considerable assets — pensions worth millions of dollars and a mortgage - free , $ 3.5 million home in Washington , D.C.
But he was not willing to work for the same $ 300,000 salary as his predecessor .
Instead , Small negotiated a total compensation package worth more than $ 530,000 , which included a salary of $ 330,000 , an annual housing allowance of $ 150,000 , and an annual payment in lieu of pension of $ 54,400 .
Concerned that this level of compensation would cause adverse publicity , the small group of regents that negotiated Small ’s employment contract did not share the details of the contract with the full board and informed the public only of Small ’s base salary .
The next year , the same small group of regents increased Small ’s base pay by another $ 150,000 and his pension payment by $ 25,500 , bringing his total cash compensation to just under $ 700,000 .
Small justified these increases to the executive committee by saying that they would allow him to adjust the salary structure for other worthy Smithsonian employees .
But salary increases for other top Smithsonian employees were far more modest than Small ’s 41 percent raise .
The next highest raise for a top executive was 21 percent ; 14 executives received raises averaging 10 percent ; and 16 received no salary increase .
The adjustments for all employees except Small could have been made under the existing salary structure .
By 2002 , observers began to express their concerns about Small ’s compensation , leadership , and spending .
For example , an extensive Washingtonian magazine article titled “ Money Man ” questioned Small ’s management style and lavish spending , including the $ 14,600 he spent to charter an executive jet for a trip to San Antonio .
Still , the regents took no action .
Negotiating Small ’s compensation was left entirely to the executive committee .
One reason the Smithsonian regents failed to address the growing concerns is that the chancellor ( the Smithsonian ’s board chair ) ran very tight meetings .
By tradition , the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court serves as Smithsonian board chancellor — a position that then Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist accepted eagerly .
Perhaps applying the same techniques that he used in Supreme Court sessions , Rehnquist stipulated that none of the quarterly board meetings run longer than 90 minutes , and he strictly limited discussions .
According to former regent Anne d’Harnoncourt , he once told regent Daniel Patrick Moynihan : “ Senator , you may address the board only when recognized by the chancellor .
When you are so recognized , your comments will be pertinent , non redundant , and brief . ”
For the most part , meetings of the regents entailed brief summaries of previously distributed reports and board votes when necessary .
There were few opportunities to introduce new agenda items .
Moreover , the board rarely met without Small present , and so the regents had few chances to discuss his performance openly .
The Smithsonian regents tried to work around this problem by convening meetings of a “ committee of the whole ” preceding the official board meetings , a process that provided some time for meaningful discussions .
But even there , Small controlled the meeting agendas and presentations , precluding frank and open discussion .
In the ensuing years , Small ’s compensation increased an average of 5 percent per year — not atypical for nonprofit leaders in this period .
Nonetheless , by 2007 Small ’s total compensation had grown to $ 915,698 , which was higher than that of almost all nonprofit CEOs in the United States and more than three times that of his predecessor .
In June 2006 , Sen .
Grassley , then chair of the Senate Finance Committee — overseer of the Smithsonian ’s budget — requested an audit of Small ’s compensation and expenses .
The Smithsonian undertook an internal audit , during which Debra Ritt , then the institution ’s inspector general ( the federal term for internal auditor ) , complained that Small put pressure on her to curtail the audit .
Ritt eventually resigned , saying that her independence was compromised because she had to report to Small rather than to the regents .
Small similarly instructed Ritt ’s successor , Sprightley Ryan , to have no direct communication with the regents .
Small also isolated the Smithsonian ’s general counsel and chief financial officer from the regents .
The regents then ordered a separate external audit , which identified nearly $ 500,000 of questionable expenses , which included first - class travel and repairs to Small ’s home .
Yet on receiving this report , the regents merely passed two resolutions that retroactively approved the expenses .
Small ’s office drafted the resolutions .
This did not please Grassley , who in March 2007 wrote another letter — this time lengthy and highly critical .
He asked many detailed questions about what appeared to be an “ anything goes ” culture at the Smithsonian , which forced taxpayers to subsidize Small ’s “ champagne lifestyle . ”
Grassley also released the letter to The Washington Post , putting severe pressure on the regents to address the issues fully .
Realizing at last that they had a major governance issue on their hands , the regents took three decisive steps .
First , they formed a special ad hoc governance committee to review the structure and processes of the board and to recommend changes .
Next , the regents created an independent committee , chaired by former U.S. Comptroller General Chuck Bowsher , to conduct a separate review of the crisis , as well as of the governance problems that led to its development .
Finally , Regent Eli Broad phoned Small to suggest that the best way to avoid further damage to the institution was for Small to leave , and Small agreed .
Small received no severance payment .
With these steps , the regents shifted their focus from the past to the future .
Working apart from each other , the independent review committee and the governance committee reached very similar conclusions about how to improve governance at the Smithsonian .
The committees ’ recommendations included ( 1 ) full board review and approval of the secretary ’s compensation ; ( 2 ) periodic meetings of the full board without the secretary ; ( 3 ) processes for regular communications between the regents and the CFO , chief legal officer , and inspector general ; and ( 4 ) clear , appropriate policies for travel expenses .
The regents communicated these governance reforms to congress and the public .
With these steps , and with a clear focus on the future , the regents were able to quell the public outcry over Small ’s excesses , attract an excellent new secretary , and put the negative publicity behind them .
THE BETTER PATH
At American University and the Smithsonian Institution , similar governance missteps avalanched into full - blown crises .
In the absence of board - wide discussions , board members assumed that other , more senior members were keeping an eye on executives .
Management also conspired to keep trustees in the dark about important decisions regarding compensation and expenses by controlling the input of external sources .
And board dynamics — ruled by contention at American University and excessive efficiency at the Smithsonian discouraged open , honest discussions .
This thick brew of weaknesses enabled the leaders of both institutions to live larger than they should have , and to do so longer than they should have .
But during their times of crisis , American University and the Smithsonian reacted differently .
In contrast to the American trustees , the Smithsonian regents acknowledged the deficiencies in their oversight and , finally recognizing the depth of their problems , acted decisively to change leadership and reform their governance .
The American board moved to reform governance as well , but more slowly .
Where the Smithsonian regents looked at each other and said , “ We all have a problem , ” the two sides of the American dispute looked at each other and said , “ You are the problem . ”
American might have recovered much faster , and with far less damage to the university , if its trustees had found a way to resolve their differences more quickly and privately .
Boards hire the best leaders they can find and , having done so , are inclined to trust and support them .
In most cases , this works out .
But strong , active , independent oversight is needed to assure that leaders do not go astray .
This includes the type of good governance that has become so common in post - Enron corporate boards : full board discussions of important issues , including leadership compensation ; regular executive sessions with only the outside directors , external auditors , and legal counsel present ; open lines of communication between officers such as the CFO and chief legal counsel ; and a culture open to whistle - blowers .
Most important , board members need to keep their antennae up .
Where there ’s smoke , there ’s usually fire .
But quick action can douse the flames before they damage an institution .

DON'T BLINK !!!
The Dress
The Wings
The Mask
The Wig
Arms , neck , feet
Y'all might have noticed that your friendly community moderator has been slacking a bit lately .
No updates .
No organizing .
What the heck was she doing that kept her so busy elsewhere ?!
This .( I do n't know who to credit for this picture - my brother - in - law emailed it to me .
If you recognize it , please let me know so I can credit ! )
This past weekend I went to DragonCon , one of the largest sci- fi conventions in the world .
It 's absolutely massive , and filled with some of the best , most talented costumers you could imagine .
I wanted to make something nifty , challenging , and Doctor Who .
I love the episode Blink , so despite being a little intimidated , I decided to give it a try .
I do n't know how many on this community are costumers , but the following is a far - too - detailed breakdown of how I made the costume .
If you want , you canskip this and go to the ' in - costume ' post over here on The dress is constructed from two layers .
The first layer is an underdress that provides structure and support to the overdres .
It is basically fitted , with a zip up the back , then flares out towards the bottom in a cone shape .
A hula - hoop sewn into the bottom hem provides rigid support .
The fabric I used was a dark grey polyester suiting from the dollar bin .
It 's got a nice smooth finish ( no woven texture ) and has enough body to hold the folds well .
The overdress is made from two full widths of fabric sewn into a giant tube and draped onto the underdress .
The down - side of sturdy fabric is that it does n't drape very well .
All those folds are held into place with dozens of individual stitches .
The back has a secret panel that will hide the center support of the wings .
And here it is painted .
The paint used was basic acrylic craft paint , with fabric medium added to make it flexible and washable .
To create the impression of stone , I used the old trick of highlights and lowlights .
First the entire dress got a coat of the darkest grey paint .
The I went back with the medium grey and painted most of it , leaving dark grey in the shadows and recesses .
Finally I used the lightest grey paint to just hit the highlights .
The effect is pretty convincing - people kept coming up and asking to touch the dress so they could feel that it was n't stone !
For all those who asked me how flexible it is : here 's a picture of it in a heap :
And on the inside , we have one of the most important parts o any costume - hidden pockets .
Wallet and phone go in one , and a bottle of water went in the other .
From the back , you can see how the hidden wing panel blends right in .
And a little touch all my own .
I figured any statue is going to end up with graffiti , right ?
Here 's a peak into the work behind the work : reference images .
To get the wings accurate , I went by screencaptures .
I saw how far the wings extended on the actreesses , then measured myself to get the proportionally right size .
Guidelines drawn onto the reference image help me design the wings to the right size and shape .
Patterns were drawn on newspaper , then transferred to my wing base .
The core of the wings is foamcore board .
Normal sheets of foamcore were too small , but fortunately there are giant display boards designed for kids ' science fairs .
Those have folds in them , but by using two layers of foamcore and lining the folds up so that they wanted to fold in opposite directions , they cancelled each other out and remained sturdy .
Each wing has two pieces : front and back .
The pattern was cut apart into individual feathers , with enough extra added to each feather so that the pieces could overlap nicely .
The feathers themselves are made from craft foam and glued to the foamcore .
The support structure for the wings runs between the layers of foamcore .
The panel between the wings was made from two layers of a stiff upholstery - type foam .
Sewn between the layers and extending out on both sides was galvanized wire .
Fabric was draped over the whole structure and sewn on , then the excess fabric was cut away .
The fabric gives the glue something to grip .
Massive amounts of glue were applied to the wing halves , and the wire supports were sandwiched between them .
I was very lucky to have the perfect thing to weight them with while they dried - a marble - topped coffee table .
Once they were fully assembled , I draped a little extra fabric from the dress around the base of each wing , to help the base blend in with the dress .
Painting used the same highlight / lowlight technique as the dress , and the same paint , just minus the fabric medium .
You can also see here how I cut notches into the foam feathers to make them look more real .
Finished wings : Strap assembly .
I 'm going to redo this so that it 's possible to get into the wings / dress without assistance .
For the masks , I started with pre-made paper maches masks , then sculpted onto them with paperclay .
I had n't ever sculpted before , so that was a challenge !
The eyes are made by cutting lenses out of those plastic capsules you get from gumball machines .
I covered them with grey pantyhose and hot - glued them into place .
The inside of the mask is painted black to cut down on light reflection .
To give you some idea of the resulting visibility - here 's a shot of my neighbor 's car through one eye in broad daylight .
The visibility was MUCH worse at night .
But I could see enough to function .
The masks were painted using the same technique mentioned earlier , though I used a little more care since the face would get more attention .
Note that I glued the lenses in AFTER they were painted .
The mask just goes on with an elastic strap .
I plan on remaking the mask - it looks pretty decent on the mannequin , but it 's just plain too small for my fat head .
I 'm sorry I do n't have any in -construction photos of the wig - I was getting pressed for time and forgot .
Basically , I cut the legs off a pair of pantyhose and sewed the rest into a cap - shape , then stitched yarn down the center seam .
The yarn was then styled and held in place with 2.5 bottles of fabric glue , and a fabric hairband added .
Painted with acrylic paint w/ fabric medium .
A shot to show the internal construction : I 'm planning on remaking the wig .
It ended up too small for me and too inaccurate .
I think I 'll try sculpting a wig next time .
I know I do n't have any makeup skills , so I wanted some sort of gloves for the arms .
I bought two different pairs of gloves before giving up and making my own .
First , I took a pair of ladies ' opaque tights and cut out the crotch .
This became the neck - hole .
I pulled them on , one arm down each sleeve , then used pins to mark the divisions between my fingers .
I cut along the pins , then sewed the fingers together by hand using a whipstitch .
After that , I took a little tuck in the wrist area of the gloves to smooth out some wrinkles .
As soon as you pull the gloves on after this , dab some nail polish along the seams - this will stabilize them and prevent the tights from running .
Then turn the gloves inside - out so that the seams are on the inside ( at this point , the right glove will become the left glove and vice - versa ) .
To increase the illusion of fingers , I glued artificial nails to the gloves .
You have to do this while the gloves are on to get the correct placement - to prevent the glue from sticking to you , rub some oil or lotion into your fingertips / nails before you pull the gloves on .
Paint the gloves while you are wearing them and let them dry on you , otherwise they will shrink .
I used the same old acrylic paint / fabric medium mix .
Before painting the gloves , I gave the nails several coats of silver nailpolish so that they would n't show pink if the paint scratched .
They look really freaky when you are n't wearing them .
But once on , the illusion is very convincing .
The neck area is covered by a sleeve made from another pair of tights .
Again , use nailpolish to control running .
And in one of those touches no one will notice : just in case anyone caught a glimpse of my feet , I added some fake toenails to a pair of grey toe - socks .
The sandals came from a thrift store and were given a coat of grey paint .
And if you made it this far , that 's pretty much it !
Now maybe I can get back to being a halfway - decent moderator .
:) This is the ' making - of ' post - if you want to read the ' in - costume ' post , it 's over here on
The UN has announced its own inquiry into attacks that hit its facilities during the conflict
By Bethany Bell
BBC News , Jerusalem
There have been numerous calls for investigations into whether war crimes were committed during the recent Israeli offensive in Gaza .
The Geneva Conventions and additional protocols prohibit the destruction of property , " except when rendered absolutely necessary by military operations " and " indiscriminate attacks " affecting civilians .
Concerns about the number of civilian casualties and damage to buildings in Gaza have been raised - among others - by the United Nations , by the Palestinian Authority , the Arab League and by human rights groups .
But it is not clear whether the alleged violations count as war crimes or how people responsible might be held accountable .
' Appalling acts '
During the three - week conflict , the United Nations says more than 40 people were killed when Israeli shells landed near a UN school and that warehouses at its main compound in Gaza City were hit by Israeli white phosphorus shells .
The UN says many people were sheltering in the school and the compound at the time of the attacks .
The UN Secretary General , Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the attacks , although he did not use the term " war crimes " .
He has demanded " a thorough investigation into these incidents and the punishment of those who are responsible for these appalling acts . "
Mr Ban has also announced a UN inquiry into the " casualties and damage " at United Nations property during the conflict .
Human rights groups , like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , say this is not enough .
They want a comprehensive international investigation into all the alleged violations of international law during the conflict - by Israel , by Hamas and by other Palestinian armed groups .
Human Rights
Watch says it has been in Gaza investigating a number of allegations .
Both sides accused the other of putting civilians in harm 's way The claims against Hamas include firing unguided rockets at residential areas .
The allegations against Israel include firing on ambulances or preventing them from reaching people in need .
The claims against both Israel and Hamas include the indiscriminate use of weapons such as heavy artillery in densely populated areas , and using civilians as human shields .
Amnesty International says it has found " compelling evidence " that white phosphorus weapons were used by Israel in crowded parts of Gaza .
The substance , which can cause severe burns , is not illegal to use on the battlefield .
But the international convention on the use of incendiary weapons says it should n't be used in civilian areas .
Mr Ban says such allegations should be investigated but not by the UN inquiry .
He said these issues should be dealt with " by a proper judiciary , organisations , agencies at a national level " .
' Highest regards '
Under international law , it is the responsibility of the state whose forces are accused to conduct their own inquiry , although the UN Security Council ( and the General Assembly ) has the power to establish special international tribunals , such as those set up for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda .
Israel says it has the matter in hand .
The Deputy Spokesman at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Andy David , told the BBC that " Israel investigates all its actions regardless of outside calls . "
He said the country did not need " external intervention to conduct any investigation " .
He said : " Israel acts according to international laws and with highest regards to morality during combat , even beyond the requirement of the law . "
A spokesperson for the Israeli army said the hits near the UN school and on the UN compound were being investigated .
Some rights groups say images from the conflict prove the illegal use of phosphorus
The army says its " operations in the Gaza Strip were carried out in compliance with the rules of warfare under international law " .
It says it took " numerous measures to avoid causing harm to the civilian population " .
In a written response to a BBC query , the army said it " always permitted the traffic of convoys and ambulances to deliver humanitarian aid and to perform emergency evacuations " .
Regarding the use of white phosphorus , it said the army only used weapons " that are permitted by international laws and conventions .
Even so , the matter is included in the inquiries conducted " by the military .
Human Rights
Watch says Israel has a " poor record " of investigating allegations of serious violations by its forces and bringing prosecutions .
Israeli rights groups and some columnists have called for an independent commission to be set up in Israel , saying it is not sufficient for the Israeli military to investigate itself .
' Completely baseless '
The Israeli army , and a number of human rights groups , say Hamas violated the rules of war by using civilians as human shields .
Human Right Watch says Hamas has done nothing to investigate .
A senior Hamas official , Ahmed Youssef , said allegations of violations were " completely baseless and nonsense " , the result of the " Israeli propaganda machine of fabrication " .
He said there were " no violations by Hamas . "
Mr Youssef added : " It was ridiculous to say human shields were used .
No Palestinian would use another Palestinian as a human shield " .
He said Human Rights Watch was not a credible institution , taking its findings from Israel .
" They need to ask the people of Gaza what happened , " he said .
Legal options Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas wants the International Criminal Court , the ICC , in the Hague to look into whether war crimes occurred in Gaza during the conflict .
But that is problematic .
The court 's prosecutor can only instigate his own proceedings against a state that belongs to the court .
Israel is not a formal member .
The UN Security Council can refer cases against non-members to the court , but such a move would likely be blocked by the United States , Israel 's strongest ally .
A state party to the court can ask for a referral - but there is no Palestinian state .
At the end of January , in a bid to get the ICC involved in a Gaza investigation , the Palestinian Authority lodged a declaration recognising the authority of the court .
The ICC 's prosecutor , Luis Moreno - Ocampo , is now examining whether the PA has the legal power to accept the court 's jurisdiction .
He is also analysing whether the alleged violations fall within the category of crimes the Court has authority to deal with ( genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes ) ; and whether national proceedings are taking place .
The legal issues are very complex and could take years to work out .
Other international lawyers say it is more likely that suspects could be prosecuted by a court in a third country under the principle of universal jurisdiction .
A Spanish judge is currently investigating the role of Israeli soldiers and security officials in a bombing in Gaza in 2002 , in which a top Hamas militant , Salah Shehada and 14 other people were killed .
There is concern in Israel that more cases like this could emerge .
In 2005 , Israeli commander Brig Gen Doron Almog escaped arrest on war crimes charges after receiving a tip - off at Heathrow Airport .
An Israeli official had warned him not to leave his plane , as a UK court had issued a warrant for his detention .
European arrest warrants may discourage other Israeli commanders from travelling to Europe .
Israel 's government has said it will provide legal protection for its soldiers against any foreign prosecution that may arise as a result of its military operation in Gaza .
The names of IDF commanders who took part in the Gaza offensive have not been published because of worries that foreign courts may pursue what the army calls " politically motivated legal action " .

Nuclear power station operators unlawfully allowed radioactive waste to seep from a decontamination unit for 14 years , Chelmsford Crown Court has heard .
Waste leaked into the ground from a sump at Bradwell power station in Essex between 1990 and 2004 , the Environment Agency claimed .
Magnox Electric Ltd , which had operated the station , denies 11 breaches of legislation governing the disposal of radioactive waste .
Mark Harris , on behalf of the Environment Agency , told the jury that leaks were caused by a combination of poor design and a lack of checks and maintenance .
He said the power station was no longer running .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The case concerns the disposal of liquid radioactive waste which leaked to the ground from a sump at the site of what is now the former Bradwell nuclear power station , " said Mr Harris .
" These leaks occurred on a number of occasions between as long ago as 1990 until discovery of these leaks in February 2004 .
The leaks were caused by a combination of poor original design of the sump ... and , in the period when this company was running it ... there was no routine inspection or maintenance of the sump until after the leak was discovered . "
The hearing continues .
Did a UFO Really Wreck the Wind Turbine in the UK ?
January 9th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
New details have emerged that may dispel rumors of a tentacle - shaped UFO reportedly striking a wind turbine in England .
As we reported earlier this week , a broken wind turbine in the English county of Lincolnshire has officials completely baffled as to what may have caused one turbine blade to break - off and another to have a large , mysterious bend about half - way down its 20 meter length [ not pictured here ] .
Some witnesses say they saw unusual flickering and cascading lights in the area a few hours before the turbine blades apparently broke at around 4 A.M .
And that was all that British tabloid , The Sun , needed to publish Thursday ’s front page headline : “ UFO hits wind turbine . ”
[ social_buttons ]
The Sun reports that one witness , John Harrison , looked out his window and saw a “ massive ball of light with tentacles going right down to the ground ” over the wind farm .
“ It was huge , ” said Harrison , “ with the tentacles it looked just like an octopus . ”
But what broke one turbine clear off and bent the other in half , may not have been the huge - tentacled ball of light after all .
According to Guardian blogger Jemima Kiss , the mysterious lights were actually the fireworks of The Guardian ‘s director of digital content , Emily Bell ’s brother .
Bell ’s brother Tim had bought fireworks at a local store to set - off in celebration of their father ’s birthday .
“ It was a medium - sized fireworks display with absolutely no ballistics , ” said Bell .
“ The fireworks were mostly dropping over my parents ’ house .
But we were laughing that we could have broken the wind turbine , ” she said .
Ecotricity , the turbine ’s owners , have no explanation for the breakage .
Dale Vince , founder of the renewable energy development company , said on the BBC ’s Today program that , whatever hit the Lincolnshire wind turbine blades was “ probably the size and weight of a cow . ”
Another , perhaps , more likely theory is that material fatigue in the blades caused the failure , with perhaps one blade falling off and denting the other .
But Ecotricity ’s Vince said they have no reason to believe that the failure was fatigue - related .
For that to have happened , Vince said the turbine would had to have suffered a “ catastrophic failure . ”
Ecotricity engineers continue to investigate the broken turbine .
But for now , says Vince , “ The UFO theory , kind of like , funny as it may sound , is the best one we ’ve currently got . ”

Former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers has filed a petition asking President George W. Bush to commute his 25 - year prison sentence for his role in the $ 11 billion accounting fraud that sank the company .
A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday that Mr. Ebbers has filed a petition with the Office of the Pardon Attorney that seeks the commutation .
Mr. Ebbers was convicted of conspiracy and fraud in 2005 and has been serving time in a Louisiana federal prison since September 2006 .
WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004 under the name MCI Inc. and was later acquired by Verizon Communications .
Newswise —
Though not often recognized as " special needs " students , gifted children require just as much attention and educational resources to thrive in school as do other students whose physical , behavioral , emotional or learning needs require special accommodations .
So says a Florida State University professor who has studied gifted students for years .
Steven I. Pfeiffer is a professor in Florida State 's Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems .
He also is a licensed psychologist who works with gifted children and their families in counseling , and has long been recognized as one of the nation 's leading authorities on issues related to gifted children .
" There is a view occasionally expressed by those outside of the gifted field that we do n't need programs devoted specifically to gifted students , " Pfeiffer said .
" ' Oh , they 're smart , they 'll do fine on their own ' is what we often hear .
And because of this anti-elitist attitude , it 's often difficult to get funding for programs and services that help us to develop some of our brightest , most advanced kids -- America 's most valuable resource .
" Giftedness is still not well understood , and children with advanced intellectual and academic abilities can perplex and challenge both educators and parents , " Pfeiffer said .
A key problem in working with gifted children is one of definition .
What exactly does it mean to be " gifted " ?
" Even within the gifted field , there is considerable controversy regarding definitional , conceptual and diagnostic issues , " Pfeiffer said .
" However , as a generally agreed - upon definition , gifted children are those who are in the upper 3 percent to 5 percent compared to their peers in one or more of the following domains : general intellectual ability , specific academic competence , the visual or performing arts , leadership and creativity . "
A key area of Pfeiffer 's research has been finding ways to best identify children who are gifted .
To that end , he led a group that developed a diagnostic test which complements the widely used intelligence test in identifying children who might be gifted .
Pfeiffer 's test is now being used in more than 600 school districts across the nation and has been translated for use in a number of other countries .
( For more information on the Gifted Rating Scales , visit www.fsu.com/pages/2006/11/20/gifted_rating_scales.html.)
" For almost a hundred years , schools used one measure , the IQ test , " Pfeiffer said .
" Our own research indicates that the IQ test , although it works fairly well , is not without limitations in identifying giftedness .
We launched a project to develop a test that would be a companion to the IQ test in helping educators better identify those children who have potential but perhaps are missed on IQ tests . "
Pfeiffer discusses the issue of defining giftedness and many of the emotional and social challenges facing gifted children in a new paper , " The Gifted : Clinical Challenges and Practice Opportunities for Child Psychiatry , " that will soon be published in the peer - reviewed Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry .
In other work involving gifted students , the state of Florida recently asked Pfeiffer and his team to lead an effort to help Florida 's best and brightest high school students reach their potential so they can help the state reach its .
The result was the establishment of the Florida Governor 's School for Space Science and Technology , which was created by the Legislature in 2007 .
( Visit www.fsu.com/pages/2008/04/08/space_science_and_tech.html to read more . )
" The Florida State University -- in partnership with the Florida Institute of Technology and Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University -- was fortunate to be asked to develop a plan to design a state - of - the - art residential academy for Florida 's most capable high school students , " Pfeiffer said .
" Essentially , the Florida Legislature was interested in providing resources for Florida 's brightest students in high schools , particularly in terms of a curriculum which would emphasize science , math , engineering and technology . "
Pfeiffer also edited a recently published book , " Handbook of Giftedness in Children : Psycho - Educational Theory , Research , and Best Practices , " that brings together experts from the fields of psychology and education to discuss a wide variety of topics pertaining to giftedness .
He says the book is intended to be an essential resource for anyone working with gifted and talented children , including clinical child and school psychologists , educators , child psychiatrists , family therapists , social workers , pediatricians and other health care professionals .
And finally , Pfeiffer is working with the national organization SENG ( Supporting Emotional Needs of the Gifted ) to develop a certification system so that professionals working with gifted children -- educators , mental health providers , pediatricians and others -- will be able to receive an official designation citing their expertise in this area .
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Technology firms like Nokia and Microsoft are rushing to open their mobile software stores , hoping to follow the runaway success of Apple ’s online App Store .

The focus of the cellphone market has been shifting to software development since Google and Apple entered the mobile market in the past two years .
Research firm Strategy Analytics forecasts the value of the mobile content market -- including downloadable games , ringtones , wallpapers , video , mobile TV , text alerts and mobile web browsing -- to grow 18 percent to $ 67 billion this year .
Nokia will unveil its download store next week at the Mobile World Congress trade show , two industry sources told Reuters .
The company will hold a press conference on Monday at 0900 GMT .
Nokia promised in early December to launch its own download store “ soon , ” as the Finnish firm merges its software Download !
store with free media sharing site Mosh and widget service WidSets .
Microsoft Corp is also planning an “ online bazaar ” for applications running on its Windows Mobile operating system , according to the Wall Street Journal .=
Blackberry - maker Research in Motion said last year it plans to launch its app store early this year .
Apple ’s App Store has proved to be popular with iPhone users , and helped spawn an entire industry of entrepreneurs who design the programs which can then be downloaded by consumers .
Apple said last month a total of 15,000 applications are available and downloads have hit 500 million in six months .
“ Apple has proved that what the mobile industry has been missing is the supermarket , ” said Eric Klein , vice president for marketing of Java at Sun Microsystems .
CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood said : “ The tremendous success of Apple ’s App Store has underlined the importance of this distribution channel . ”
U.S. software firm Amdocs , software and services provider for telecom operators , said it would unveil its white - label application store offering -- which enables the buyer to brand the store -- to carriers at the trade show next week .
“ This year , app stores will be the main topic of the show , ” Gil Rosen , a senior official at Amdocs , told Reuters .
Amdocs aims to attract a wide developer audience through access to a wide range of phone models .
The firm says its access to service provider subscriber data will let programmers create more appealing software .
“ The industry is like a big ship .
It takes time to move it .
Service providers are not the first movers , but when they move , the industry moves , ” Rosen said .

The ferocity of the infighting reflects a collapse in support for the Afghan president - both within the Afghan coalitions who have supported him since his election in 2004 , and among his backers in Britain , the United States , the European Union and NATO .
During a visit to Kabul last week , Foreign Secretary David Miliband said that British financial and military support for the Afghanistan would only continue if Mr Karzai 's government raised its game .
( CNN ) -- Olympic hero Michael Phelps was suspended from competitive swimming for three months on Thursday -- just hours after one of his sponsors announced it would not renew his contract after a photo surfaced of him smoking from a bong .
Michael Phelps admitted " regrettable behavior " after a photo of him smoking from a bong was published .
USA Swimming , the nation 's governing body for competitive swimming , said it was withdrawing financial support for Phelps and barring him from competition during the period of his " reprimand . "
" This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated , but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people , particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming - member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero , " they said in a statement .
" Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust , " the statement continued .
Earlier Thursday , Kellogg Co. said it will not renew Phelps ' advertising contract .
" Michael 's most recent behavior is not consistent with the image of Kellogg , " company spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz said .
" His contract expires at the end of February , and we have made a decision not to extend his contract . "
Norwitz said Kellogg 's relationship with Phelps began with the company 's support of the U.S. Olympic team .
Kellogg did not renew its sponsorship of the team when it expired in December , she said .
Phelps admitted " regrettable behavior " on Sunday after a British newspaper published the photograph .
The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia .
The Richland County , South Carolina , sheriff 's office said Tuesday it was investigating whether Phelps smoked marijuana on the school campus , adding it would file criminal charges if it determined he did .
Both university police and Columbia , South Carolina , police said they would not pursue charges , according to The State newspaper in Columbia .
It was unclear where the party took place , the paper said , or whether it was on campus .
On Thursday , before the decisions by USA Swimming and Kellogg were announced , Phelps told CNN affiliate WBAL that the incident was a result of " bad judgment . "
Watch Phelps ' comments to WBAL »
" I can learn from it and try to make my life better than it has been in the past , " he told WBAL .
" I think it 's hard to really be ready for any of this .
But I 've actually been able to talk to a lot of people , and lot of people that have been in my shoes in other sports , and I 've been able to get their perspective and just talk to them a little bit , and that 's been helpful over the last few days , " Phelps said .
In a statement released Sunday , Phelps , who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing , China , said : " I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment . "
" I 'm 23 years old , and despite the successes I have had in the pool , I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , not in a manner that people have come to expect from me , " he said .
" For this , I am sorry .
I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again . "
iReport.com : Should Phelps have been suspended ?
The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part : " Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions .
We are confident that , going forward , Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion . "
In 2004 , Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury , Maryland .
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation .
He also issued an apology after that incident .
Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who pledged to " My Victory , " an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean .

Contradicting previous reports , a US Army electronic - warfare colonel has apparently confirmed the existence of working non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse ( EMP ) ordnance - apparently so portable that it is even available in hand - grenade size .
The revelation came at a blogger roundtable ( press conference ) held in order to introduce the US Army 's new electronic - warfare specialist career field .
The briefing was reported by the war - hacks at Military.com :
" EMP grenade technology is out there , but I 've never had my hands on one , " said Col Laurie Buckhout , chief of the newly formed Electronic Warfare Division , Army Operations , Readiness and Mobilization ...
The target may be a small building or a village , she said , and so a small jammer could be used , or EMP grenades .
The conventional method of generating an EMP powerful enough to disable electronics over a large area is the detonation of a nuclear weapon .
However , militaries worldwide have long wished to have such a capability in less - drastic form .
This has led to extensive speculation on pulse bombs powered by conventional explosives , or High Powered Microwave ( HPM ) raygun - style kit* .
Even the highly advanced US forces had n't been generally thought to have developed a successful pulse - bomb yet , with most reports indicating that such a capability remains a few years off ( as has been the case for decades ) .
Furthermore , the pulse ordnance has usually been seen as large and heavy , in the same league as an aircraft bomb or cruise missile warhead - or in the case of an HPM raygun , of a weapons - pod or aircraft payload size .
Now , however , it appears that in fact the US military has already managed to get the coveted pulse - bomb tech down to grenade size .
Colonel Buckhout apparently envisages the Army electronic warfare troopers of tomorrow lobbing a pulse grenade through the window of an enemy command post or similar , so knocking out all their comms .
The existence of pulse bombs one can clip to one 's belt would also imply that bigger ones have been made .
( US military - sponsored efforts to develop EMP - proof radars might lend this some credence , it was n't for the agency involved . )
It would seem that the unstoppable droid assassins , prowling aerial hunter - killers etc of the future have been stymied before they even properly got their boots on got booted up .
Nonetheless , despite the apparently authoritative nature of the source , we 're going to file this one under " unconfirmed " .

Bush gave dozens of donors jobs in final days of administration John Byrne
Published : Tuesday February 10 , 2009
Print This Email This World Bank job can pay $ 3,000 a day Fred Fielding , Emmet Flood and William Burck have something in common .
They all work with President George W. Bush and were appointed to lucrative , obscure jobs by him in the closing days of his administration -- jobs that can pay as much as $ 3,000 an hour .
Less that two weeks before leaving office , Bush named the three to an obscure World Bank agency called the International Center for Settlement of Investment disputes , where , if called to hear a case , they can earn as much as $ 3,000 an hour -- plus expenses .
Bush also named two other prominent Republicans to the agency .
The appointments last for six years .
According to the Washington Post 's Dan Eggen , Bush made more than 100 such appointments , tapping associates to non-confirmable , obscure posts such as the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the U.S. - Russia Polar Bear Commissions .
Roughly half of the jobs that Bush filled after Obama 's election were given to donors who gave $ 1.9 million to Republicans since 2003 .
Twenty were filled by former Bush aides ( Fielding was the White House Counsel , who sent the note to Rove about executive immunity in the fired US Attorneys case ) .
Additional seats went to " old hands " at previous Republican presidencies , such as that of Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush .
Working for Nixon , it appears , has now become a tangible asset .
Many other positions are unpaid ; valued more for how they look on a resume than the paychecks recipients can cash at the bank .
Yet the process of their selection shows how important connections and donations remain -- even at the end of a presidency -- to securing lucrative politically - appointed jobs .
" Carlos M. Gutierrez , Bush 's last commerce secretary , now sits on the board of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars .
James W. Holsinger Jr. , whom Bush had nominated at one point to be surgeon general , snagged a seat on the fitness council , along with quarterback Eli Manning , figure skater Michelle Kwan and other athletic stars , " Eggen notes .
" Condoleezza Rice , in a customary move for former secretaries of state , was named to the board of trustees for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts .
" Bush named a dozen appointees to the council that oversees the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum , including former chief of staff Joshua B. Bolten , former homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff , former attorney general Michael B. Mukasey , and Elliott Abrams , who was an aide to Reagan and George H.W. Bush .
Two major GOP donors -- real estate billionaire Alan I. Casden and former public broadcasting chairman Cheryl F. Halpern -- were also on the list , " Eggen added .
The World Bank post , while lucrative , is n't necessarily a cash cow ; the agency 's head said that most appointees never hear a case .
Regardless , the job is worth its weight in Washington , where connections are invaluable in securing jobs -- particularly those involved in lobbying for laws .
Uh , yes , we want it and it ’s been too long .
You ?Â
It ’s been awhile since we ’ve seen a 26 - year - old girl ’s basketball coach who looks like this who just might be a child predator .
Meet Brittany Sumrall Johnson , the Kilbourne ( La. )
High School girl ’s coach who ’s racked up a 36 - 17 record over the last two years but just became more famous as the hot English teacher who has been sending sexually oriented messages to one of her students , says the boy ’s parents .
News reports began flowing Wednesday in regards to Brittany Sumrall Johnson , 26 , sending one of her eighth grade students questionable messages on MySpace since October .
The reports claim Johnson sent messages asking the 14 year old boy for sex .
Now , being the responsible news organization we are , there was some investigating into a MySpace page for Ms. Johnson .
We were n’t successful but other , more legit , outlets did our dirty work .
We did find the Facebook .
Not yet accepted as a friend .
We ’ll keep you up to date over the weekend on this request .
So exactly what were in those lurid messages .
Some of the e-mails stated : “ And oh my gosh did u look hot !
I ca n’t wait 4 u 2 play varsity ( so ) we can hook up on the bus on the way home lol ! , ” ; “ oh yea and in the closet , I so wanted to grab you and pull u in there and shut that door and take full advantage of you … ” ; and “ has anyone ever told u that u have a fine aâ€ ” and body ? ”
RAWWRRRR !
Jesus H. She wanted on the bus ?
This chick is wild and …….. married .
Why does n’t this ever happen to good guys like us ?
We ’re of legal age , do n’t mind doing it in moving vehicles and like closets .
Yours or ours .
Name a time , Mrs. Johnson .
New Pollution Radar Exposes Urban Smog
March 11th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Ever wonder just how much smog you ’re bathing in every day ?
A new pollution radar developed by Surrey Satellite Technology , the University of Leicester , and EADS Astrium might be able to show you .
The radar , which can be attached to satellites , can monitor air quality across large swaths of urban and industrial spaces .
Leiceister scientists are also working on a ground - based version of the CityScan technology .
When completed , it will provide real - time , 3D maps of atmospheric gases .
The maps will be created analyzing solar / UV radiation from multiple instruments and viewing points –essentially enabling a 3D composite to be created .
According to the World Health Organization , 2.4 million people die each year from air pollution - related causes .
Let ’s hope CityScan can prevent at least some of these deaths .

Members of Congress can't spell new president 's name Ron Brynaert
Published : Monday January 26 , 2009
Print This Email This
One would think that spelling President Barack Obama 's name would be pretty easy for his former colleagues in Congress , especially after it 's been practically everywhere the last year and a half .
" Members of Congress have had a lot of nice things to say about our new president , but many of them have had trouble simply spelling the guys name , " Roll Call 's Heard on the Hill gossip column reports .
The Capitol Hill paper notes that the website gooseGrade.com " released a study earlier this month finding that at least 60 million Web pages contain a misspelling of Democratic President Barack Obamas first name , " so Roll Call " conducted a ( highly scientific , natch ) Internet search of Member Web sites on Friday to see if anyone had referred to the prez using two of the most common misspellings  ' Barak ' and ' Barrack . ' "
And it 's not just Republicans .
" Members who favored ' Barak ' included Rep. Mark Souder ( R - Ind. ) , in a photo caption from Tuesdays inauguration ; Rep. Devin Nunes ( R - Calif. ) , in a press release on Obamas swearing - in ; Sen. Patty Murray ( D - Wash . ) , in a photo caption from the inauguration ( which has since been fixed ) ; Rep. John Carter ( R - Texas ) , in a Jan. 9 press release urging Obama to work with Republicans on tax cuts ; and Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - Kan. ) , in a November 2008 statement congratulating Obama on his election victory , " Roll Call reports .
Rep. Jack Kingston ( R - Ga. ) , Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D - N.Y. ) , Sen. Kit Bond ( R - Mo. ) , and Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) were all busted employing the name " Barrack . "
At the very least , none appear to have confused him with the head of al Qaeda , as some in the media have , though , of course , sometimes that was done on purpose .
But , most probably , Obama would laugh off the report and say that it was fine , as long as they keep calling him Mr. President .
“ When we had the fridge , we were eating a lot of prepared food from the grocery store , ” she said .
But the cooler has limited room , and the freezer is for meat and vegetables .
Without the extra storage , Ms. Muston finds herself cooking more — which requires more time and forethought because items from the freezer must be thawed .
Asked whether the couple had to give up any cherished foods , Ms. Muston sighed .
“ Cold beer , ” she said .
“ Scott ca n’t come home and grab a cold beer out of the fridge anymore .
He has to put it in the cooler and wait an hour . ”
For the most part , though , the couple seems to have made a smooth transition to life without a refrigerator , something others have tried but failed to do .
Beth Barnes , 29 , who works for the Kentucky Bar Association , unplugged the refrigerator in her apartment in Frankfort last May to be “ a little radical , ” she said .
After reading online comments from others without a fridge , she learned she could move condiments to a pantry , and that butter can remain unrefrigerated for a week or more .
The main concern was how to store dairy products , a major part of her diet .
Ms. Barnes decided to use a cooler , which she refilled daily during the summer with ice that she brought home from an ice machine at her office .
That worked fine until she began to travel out of town for her job this fall , and the system hit a snag .

In the end she compromised and bought a minifridge .
“ I could drop the refrigerator completely if I had a milkman , ” she said .
“ I might eventually try it again if I ever figure out the milk situation . ”
MANY environmentalists — even many who think nothing of using recycled toilet paper or cut the thermostat to near - arctic levels — see fridge - free living as an extreme choice or an impractical and excessive goal .
BETWEEN graduating from college and moving in with his fiancée , Jim Mimlitsch moved nine times in 14 years .
He hated moving , but accepted it as his fate and developed a habit of hoarding cardboard boxes .
For convenience , he kept a set of boxes on standby in the back of his closets .
But after Mr. Mimlitsch , 38 , bought a condominium in Irvine , Calif. , in 2002 , he happily handed off his boxes to a friend .
“ I just did n’t want to have them anymore , ” he said .
“ It just felt more like home that way . ”
Then last June , Mr. Mimlitsch became engaged and began to prepare for yet another move , to his fiancée ’s apartment in Laguna Hills , Calif. , and for the headache of acquiring more cardboard boxes .
When he told the real estate agent through whom he was renting out his condo how much he dreaded this aspect of the move , she suggested he contact Spencer Brown , the owner of a three - year - old company , Rentagreenbox.com .
Finding ExpressionEngine Exploits
Running PHP on the http://demo.expressionengine.com demo installation .
ExpressionEngine allows and executes image files that contain PHP code .
Drupal Approach - Announced release
ExpressionEngine Approach - Quiet release
Increased security with uploaded file names to prevent Apache from overzealously parsing a file as a script .
Open Source , Open Security
I recently evaluated ExpressionEngine for viability as a CMS replacement for Drupal .
ExpressionEngine ( EE ) is a commercial CMS tool built on PHP and mySQL by EllisLab .
A client of ours was attracted to its clean interface , built - in features , and expandability .
I was impressed by the well - designed UI and the flexibility of EE 's templating engine .
There are definitely lessons the Drupal community can learn from their attention to detail .
In fact , as I explored the EE support forums , I discovered a great deal of antagonism towards Drupal -- to my surprise , it was n't based on features or learning curve , but on the idea that Drupal is insecure .
In the forums , comments such as this were common whenever Drupal or other CMS systems were brought up for comparison :
All the links above reference Secunia a reporting service that aggregates reported issues on security .
By doing a few searches , you can view the Secunia security issues reported for Drupal and ExpressionEngine .
Performing the above searches , you can see that ExpressionEngine has had only one security advisory over the course of 3 years .
Over that same time period , Drupal has had over 80 .
It 's easy to draw the incorrect conclusion there that ExpressionEngine therefore is more secure .
Secunia specifically states . "
And for good reason , what we 're experiencing here is a difference in security practices .
In this particular difference , Drupal reports its security vulnerabilities , while ExpressionEngine does not .
At the time of initial research however , it was not clear that this was the case .
With the primary developers touting the security of ExpressionEngine over Drupal , I thought perhaps EE does have much better security .
So I set out to see what happens when security issues are reported .
In one day of evaluation , I foundin version 1.6.2 of the core ExpressionEngine software ( at that time , the latest version ) .
That did n't bode well for my expectations of EllisLabs ' reporting of issues .
The vulnerabilities included a simple XSS attack unauthorized deletion of private message files , and allowing of arbitrary code execution ( dangerous enough that I e- mailed the developers directly ) .
Unsurprisingly , none of these issues were reported to Secunia .
The code review of ExpressionEngine revealed a very high awareness of secure exploits , and took steps to avoid many forms of attacks .
There are several functions built - in that scour uploaded files for potential embedded code , and inline documentation that mentions why certain precautions are taken .
ExpressionEngine in itself is a fairly securely written piece of software .
What 's different between Drupal and ExpressionEngine is how each responds to security vulnerabilities .
Despite efforts to write secure code , programmers invariably make mistakes .
How those mistakes are handled determines a large part of how secure the software is overall , but more importantly how secure the sites are that run the software .
Drupal believes in an open security policy .
Because all the source code is available at all times , attempting to cover - up security problems by discreetly slipping it into an update is n't viable , because all the changes between versions can be tracked .
The fixing of the bug usually happens through a special security process , where the security team is notified via e-mail .
The problem is fixed in the source code , then an announcement is made as quickly as possible that an update needs to be applied .
This explains the 80 + vulnerabilities listed by Secunia on Drupal , because every security problem is handled in a public manner .
Websites running insecure versions of modules are notified via the Update Status module , strongly encouraging administrators to update the module as soon as possible .
EllisLab takes the opposite approach , instead attempting to correct security problems without publicizing their errors .
In the case of the 3 vulnerabilities reported from the security review , no warning was ever issued to their clients of potential vulnerabilities .
A new release was created and posted to the download area , and sites that are running the previous version of the software receive a notice that a new version has been released .
After the new version was released , I finally was able to see exactly how a serious vulnerability was handled .
In the ExpressionEngine changelog , the vulnerability that potentially allows total control of a site was summarized in a bullet point :
It would stand to reason then , that the phrases for " increased security " or " add additional security " truly mean " fixing a security problem " .
The publicly available changelog lists at least 14 enhancements of security , each one likely fixing an actual security problem .
In these cases , ExpressionEngine is leading their customers into a false sense of security .
Claiming a high level of security publicly while quietly fixing easily exploited bugs during development .
There 's nothing wrong with discreetly fixing bugs .
Doing so can make it more difficult to find the exact exploit .
However , in the case where users can easily compare one version against another , the manner in which the bug is fixed is a small barrier for hackers .
Because most web applications are delivered in a parsable scripting language ( such as Perl , Python , PHP , JavaScript , ASP , etc. ) the full source code of these applications is available to anyone that has ever installed the software .
It only takes a single , well - informed user ( hacker ) to read through the code , and expose potential threats .
The " security by obscurity " approach , while always dangerous , has even less effectiveness when the source code is available .
So to the folks at ExpressionEngine , yes , keeping your software secure can indeed be a full - time job .
Because mistakes are inevitable in coding , security problems will exist in all software .
Simply not telling the software 's users about insecurities wo n't keep hackers from exploiting them .
It 's a matter of educating , that the best way to have a secure website is to have an up - to - date website .
ExpressionEngine is serious about fixing problems , so long as they do n't have to tell anyone .
With their current marketing spin on security , the most difficult task will be honesty with those users that have been mislead .

When I visited this fall , the air was redolent with Montmorency pie cherries finishing their mash in a chilled steel tank .
Shining copper stills , industrial macerators and barrels filled a huge , light - filled hangar on a former Naval base ( the vodka is named for it : Hangar One ) .
Within an hour the cherries had become eau de vie , dripping from a stainless steel pipe while Jörg Rupf , the founder , offered tastes to an impressively informed group of about 30 visitors .
Absinthe Verte , perfected by Lance Winters , Mr. Rupf ’s distilling partner , is one of the handful of American absinthes on the market again after a centurylong drought .
The spirit epitomizes the fervid scene in the Bay Area : it is at once classic , with a 19th - century aesthetic , and innovative — something that had not been available at all , much less in this highly cultured form .
The bar that best reflects this dichotomy is Bourbon & Branch .
Styled a modern - day speakeasy , it is in a space in the seedy Tenderloin neighborhood that was once an actual speakeasy .
A password ( get it online with your reservation ) is required to enter the den of wood , leather , distantly twinkling tinplate and oceans of brown liquors .
Twenties jazz plays quietly , and guests are greeted with small glasses of champagne punch on linen coasters .
If it all seems a bit pompous — a reservation at a bar ? — it works .
Even on a Friday evening , Bourbon & Branch is an intimate setting for the contemplation of fine cocktails .
It draws a diverse crowd of aficionados who are rewarded with exquisite drinks : the Sazerac is not too sweet , its rye bite balanced with a lemony nose .
The 1794 ( really a Boulevardier ) is delicious .
My Democrat , a concoction of peach and bourbon , was tasty but lacked heft .
I sent it back and the bartender happily fixed the problem with a splash of bourbon .
The bar features a seasonal menu of what Brian Sheehy , one of the owners , calls “ market fresh cocktails , ” as well as two that change every day .
Bourbon & Branch has become the nexus of a tight - knit community , with alumni opening bars and developing menus throughout the city .
Last month , Mr. Sheehy and co-owners opened Cask , a store selling craft spirits and bartending paraphernalia .
SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) -- Instead of Apple CEO Steve Jobs , celebrity - seekers at Tuesday 's Macworld keynote address had to settle for crooner Tony Bennett .
And instead of blockbuster news from Apple Vice President Philip Schiller , attendees got changes in iTunes pricing , a series of software upgrades and a $ 2,800 17 - inch notebook .
Apple Vice President Philip Schiller delivers the MacWorld keynote address Tuesday in San Francisco .
Among Mac users and industry observers , reaction to the 90 - minute keynote , which Apple says will be its last at Macworld , was predictably mixed .
" Tony Bennett got a standing ovation .
Apple , not so much , " said Philip Elmer - DeWitt , who writes an Apple column for Fortune magazine .
" It was n't up to Steve Jobs ' standards .
Phil is not the showman that Steve is , but he did n't have much material to work with . "
" I think Phil did a great job , " countered Chuck Freedman , an IT specialist from suburban Detroit , Michigan .
" Yes , we miss Steve , but Phil handled everything well .
I 'm here to see what Apple 's doing next , not how much weight Steve has lost . "
So what is Apple doing next ?
Pre -Macworld rumors about an iPhone Nano and a preview of the Snow Leopard operating system proved unfounded .
Instead , Schiller introduced upgrades to Apple 's iLife and iWork software suites , unveiled a 17 - inch unibody MacBook Pro with a more powerful battery , and announced tweaks to iTunes ' 99 cents - per- song pricing model .
The result earned Schiller consistent applause but not the wild cheering that greeted Jobs ' 2007 announcement of the iPhone , for example .
Watch Schiller 's keynote address at Macworld »
" It was a real solid presentation , " said Mike McGuire , a media analyst with Gartner Market Research , citing Apple 's emphasis on revamping its core products amid a challenging economic climate .
" There 's not the frenzied hoopla [ of past years ] .
But maybe this is n't the best time for that . "
From a consumer perspective , the day 's biggest news may have been the price changes at iTunes , Apple 's wildly successful online music store .
Beginning April 1 , songs on the site will cost $ 1.29 , 99 cents or 69 cents , although more songs will be sold at the lower price than at the higher price , Schiller said .
Apple did not elaborate on how songs will be priced , although observers expect most new hits to cost $ 1.29 and older songs to be cheaper .
" Apple is essentially leaving that up to the [ music ] labels , " McGuire said .
" It 'll be interesting to see how the labels and the artists deal with that . "
After his iTunes announcement , Schiller yielded the spotlight to Bennett , who glided onstage with a four - piece band to sing " The Best is Yet to Come " and his signature " I Left My Heart in San Francisco . "

Attendees seemed bored during Schiller 's demonstration of the revamped iWork , Apple 's software for office use .
Some also expressed skepticism about Apple 's plans to launch a beta version of iWork.com that will allow users to review and edit documents collaboratively online .
But they perked up when Schiller mentioned a new app that will let people use their iPhones as remotes to run multimedia business presentations .
Audience members -- including former Vice President Al Gore , an Apple board member -- showed more enthusiasm for the upgraded iPhoto , iMovie and Garage Band software , which is bundled together as iLife '09 and goes on sale in late January .
The new iPhoto has face - recognition software that will make it easier for users to create galleries of friends and family members .
It also contains GPS geotagging that will allow users to sort their photos geographically .
Apple is also focusing on improved video editing .
" We decided to completely rewrite iMovie and come up with a whole new version , " Schiller said .
" We 've added so much depth and so much power , we really believe it 's going to be the video - editing product that everybody uses . "
Watch Schiller unveil Mac's new photo application »
The new version has better precision editing , video stabilization , easier audio editing and smoother transitions , Schiller said .
The new iLife will also have a feature for aspiring musicians .
Learn to Play , part of Garage Band ' 09 , includes software for nine free basic lessons for guitar and nine free basic lessons for piano / keyboards .
It also includes Artist Lessons with video instructions from such famous musicians as Sting , John Fogerty , Norah Jones and Sarah MacLachlan , who will teach users how to play their songs .
Watch Fogerty give a lesson on how to play ' Proud Mary ' »
Schiller showed a video of Fogerty explaining how to play the chords for the Creedence Clearwater Revival classic " Proud Mary . "
Apple 's third major announcement at the conference focused on a 17 - inch unibody MacBook Pro notebook .
At less than 1 inch thick and weighing in at 6.6 pounds , it would be the world 's lightest notebook of its size , Schiller said .
New technology will allow its battery to be recharged up to 1,000 times , more than three times the industry standard .
It can last up to eight hours on a single charge and runs on less than 50 percent the energy of a single lightbulb , Schiller said .
He also touted the notebook 's improved screen .
The new MacBook Pro will cost $ 2,799 and starts shipping in late January .
This was the first Macworld keynote since 1997 not to be delivered by Apple CEO Steve Jobs , the tech visionary who relinquished his usual Macworld appearance last month amid concerns about his health .
At past Macworlds -- the annual gathering of Mac users , consultants and partners -- fans stood for hours in lines that snaked around the block to watch Jobs unveil gadgets in his trademark jeans and black mock turtleneck .
Recent Macworld keynotes introduced such major Apple products and services as iTunes ( 2001 ) , the iPod Shuffle ( 2005 ) and the iPhone ( 2007 ) .
See " A decade of Macworld " timeline »
But Apple is changing the way it does business .
Thanks to its
Web site and its network of retail stores , the company can reach more than 100 million customers around the world directly , which makes Apple less reliant on trade shows like Macworld to spread its message .
The biggest topic of discussion at Macworld , however , was not a potential Apple product or even the contents of Schiller 's speech but the mystery surrounding Jobs ' absence from the trade show celebrating the company he co-founded .
Attendees were heartened by Jobs ' announcement Monday that his recent weight loss was caused by a hormonal imbalance that can be remedied and that he will continue as Apple 's CEO while he gets treatment .
Concerns about Jobs ' health have hounded Apple since 2004 , when he was treated for pancreatic cancer .

Brace yourself for weirdness : Our buddy Todd at Tech Flash unearthed a guitar - drenched musical extravaganza by Jim Allchin , the former Windows chief who many think mismanaged Vista into the ground .
Advertisement
Though he looks like a young feller on the album cover , Allchin 's pushing 60 — having spent 16 years at Microsoft before retiring the day Vista launched .
Though many execs are to blame for Vista 's combination of problems , people I speak to now like to finger Allchin — a conveniently absent fall guy — for not being a strong enough manager .
He actually briefed me on Vista about a year before it launched , and seemed like a nice enough guy .
Of course , he was not wearing a sleeveless t- shirt at the time , nor did he mention his passion for guitar - driven adult - contemporary ballads .
Advertisement
True to his roots , at least some of the songs have a tech angle , such as the opening track , " Enigma Machines . "
Allchin 's website explains :
Enigma Machines were early encoders / decoders for cryptography .
They had many rotors and the guitar sound in this song reminds me of this amazing device as well as the intensity of the search for an answer to some puzzle ...
Of course there are more songs with corny romantic themes , such as " She 's in Love with Me , " which he calls " a little latin number about a sexy Caterina . "
To those wondering if he went the route of T - Pain and Kanye , he did in fact , use auto - tuning , as the first measures of the cheese - rock " Let 's Play " can attest .
In fairness , Allchin does sing the praises of the computer - assisted recording process , though many producers feel it can be soul - sapping .
You can hear all of the songs on the sample page .
I 'll warn you , a little goes a long way , especially if you feel like making a Songsmith joke .
Advertisement
This might not be the tech - industry equivalent of discovering Scooter Libby 's novel ( among other things , it lacks any reference to human - orsine coitus ) .
But in his solo project , Allchin might have buried a mea culpa or two .
One track is entitled " I'm Your Man , " and another is called " I'm About to Fall . "
A little too late for that , Jim , but good luck with the world tour .

Two children from the Indian city of Mumbai who shot to fame in the film Slumdog Millionaire are set to leave for the Oscars ceremony in the US .
The film has been nominated in 10 categories , and has already won four Golden Globe awards .
Slumdog Millionaire is a rags - to - riches story of a game show winner .
Its child stars , Rubina Ali and Azharuddin Ismail , from Mumbai 's now world - famous slums , have already seen their lives change .
They have been enrolled into a school and have won worldwide recognition .
The film 's British director , Danny Boyle , and its producers have said they will take responsibility for funding the whole of the children 's education .
The child stars - both aged under 10 years - are now getting enquiries about working in Bollywood films .
They are set to fly to Los Angeles , where they will walk on the red carpet and rub shoulders with Hollywood stars .
For the moment the pair seem more excited about shopping - a luxury for them - than going to America where they are confident the film will win all the awards .
The glamorous world of the Oscars stands in sharp contrast to the squalid conditions in Mumbai 's slums but in their case life is truly beginning to imitate art .
Caroline Kennedy , a daughter of America ’s most storied political family who for many years fiercely guarded her privacy , is considering whether to pursue the Senate seat expected to be vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton early next year , a family member said Friday .
“ I believe that she is considering it , ” said her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who has spoken to Ms. Kennedy about the matter during the past week .
“ A lot of people the last couple of weeks have urged her to do it . ”
Ms. Kennedy called Gov. David A. Paterson on Wednesday to discuss the position , Mr. Paterson confirmed Friday .
The governor will choose a replacement for Mrs. Clinton upon her expected confirmation as secretary of state next month .
“ The conversation was informational , ” Mr. Paterson said .
“ She did not express an interest in the Senate , but we talked about the Senate , so I got that she was just trying to get some information to determine whether or not she would like to have an interest in it .
And that was it . ”
If you 're old enough to remember Doc Adams in the western TV series Gunsmoke , or have seen any reruns , you 'd know that ol '
Doc was the kind of crusty codger of a doctor who would look right at your symptoms and get a pretty good idea how he needed to treat you .
And somehow , you 'd think that kind of intuitive medical wisdom would have been passed down to modern physicians .....
It has not .
Today 's science - and - Big - Pharma - stuffed physicians are as wise and observant as a bag of rocks when it comes to clear symptoms , all thanks to their tunnel vision love affair with ink spots on a piece of paper called a “ lab result ” .
And one of the worst laboratory tests ever invented ?
The TSH , aka Thyroid Stimulating Hormone , or thyrotropin for short .
In the body , the real live Thyroid Stimulating Hormone is produced by the pituitary gland as a messenger to the thyroid gland .
When your body needs more energy , the TSH from the pituitary knocks on the door of your thyroid gland , telling it to produce and secrete more energy - giving , life - sustaining thyroid hormones .
Doctors , and especially Endocrinologists , will proclaim the TSH lab test as a reliable gauge of your thyroid function with its so - called “ normal ” reference range .
Since it 's inception around 1973 , the TSH lab has been the gold standard of diagnosis used by doctors and health fairs alike .
Theoretically , if your TSH lab result falls outside the top of the normal range , you are hypothyroid , i.e. the real TSH hormone is screaming like a deranged madman at your dawdling thyroid .
If it falls below the normal range , you are hyperthyroid , i.e. the real TSH is unemployed because your thyroid is in fast forward motion .
And if it falls anywhere within that range , bingo .
You have normal thyroid function .
And it 's all been a big bunch of baloney for hundreds of millions of thyroid patients .
Testing via the TSH lab has ultimately been measuring the function or malfunction of your pituitary gland , such as the detection of hypopituitarism .
Testing a pituitary hormone response to the thyroid gland gives no clue as to which organs are receiving the secreted thyroid hormone into its tissues , and which are not .
As a result , luckless thyroid patients around the world for over 35 years have been subjected to the tyranny of the TSH , a term coined by Dr. John C. Lowe .
Even deeper , we have been subjected to the tomfoolery and crazy - making of the term “ normal ” .
Visit numerous thyroid patient groups on the net , including the Yahoo group Natural Thyroid Hormones , and you 'll find a slew of thyroid patients reporting years of a “ normal ” proclamation within a dubious TSH normal range .
Yet , all those “ normal ” years included obvious and clear hypothyroid symptoms which modern myopic physicians dismiss , including chronic low - grade depression , easy fatigue and poor stamina , weight gain , aches and pains , anxiety , constipation , feeling cold , dry skin or hair , rising blood pressure or cholesterol , and / or other clear symptoms of a flagging thyroid .
And when the TSH lab result finally rises high enough to reveal the hypothyroid state , the compromised patient is not only sick as a dog , but they may have crept into another difficult condition to treat : adrenal fatigue .
Adrenal fatigue is explained on the activist website Stop the Thyroid Madness here : http://www.stopthethyroidmadness.com/adrenal-info with even more detail in the book of the same name .
On a side note : doctors who fail to ascertain the presence of an autoimmune attack on the thyroid , called Hashimoto 's disease , can also miss the reality when they solely rely on the TSH , since the result can be normal one time , and high or low another due to the die off of thyroid cells from the attack .
Even when one 's hypothyroidism is caught and medications started , some symptoms will persist in spite of moving the TSH lab result back into the problematic normal range .
That reality is a double whammy thanks to the use of the inadequate T4 - only thyroxine medications .
( See my OpEdNews Feb . 2 nd , 2009 article titled Synthroid Sucks !
The Rallying Cry of Thyroid Patients vs. Clueless Doctors here : click here Finally , as a growing body of patients have discovered a far better treatment with desiccated natural thyroid like Armour , they are forced to fight the TSH - is - boss mentality of their doctors all over again .
When all symptoms of hypothyroidism are removed with desiccated thyroid , the TSH lab result is suppressed i.e. far below the normal range with not one hint of hyperthyroidism .
Yet rattled and rigid doctors proclaim “ You are hyper ! ” , once again based solely on an ink spot on a piece of paper , and force the hapless patient to lower their desiccated thyroid with the return of some symptoms .
Or if hyper symptoms do raise their ugly heads with a suppressed TSH , doctors are clueless about the problem of adrenal fatigue , aka low cortisol causing the problem , and the need for correct treatment of either sluggish adrenals or an HPA ( hypothalamus / pituitary / adrenals ) hypofunction .
No wonder so many thyroid patients feel forced to self - treat .
Of course , the TSH lab test does n't stand alone in the blame game .
Doctors garner the bonehead award for the TSH calumny .
It 's doctors who make man-made TSH lab ranges more important than clinical presentation , causing millions of patients to leave their doctor 's office still sick to one degree or another .
A true loss of medical wisdom .

With no buttons to guide the fingers on its glassy surface , the touch - screen cellphone may seem a particularly daunting challenge .
But Mr. Raman said that with the right tweaks , touch - screen phones  many of which already come equipped with GPS technology and a compass  could help blind people navigate the world .
“ How much of a leap of faith does it take for you to realize that your phone could say , ‘ Walk straight and within 200 feet you ’ll get to the intersection of X and Y , ’ ” Mr. Raman said .
“ This is entirely doable . ”
ADVOCATES for the blind have long complained that technology companies have done a generally poor job of making their products accessible .
The Web , while opening many opportunities for blind people , is still riddled with obstacles .
And sophisticated screen - reader software , which turns documents and Web pages into synthesized speech , can cost more than $ 1,000 .
Even with a screen reader , many sites are hard to navigate .
Last year , the National Federation of the Blind reached a settlement of a landmark class - action lawsuit against one company whose site advocates found unusable , Target .
In the settlement , the retailer agreed to make its Web site accessible to blind people .
The federation assesses the usability of Web sites and currently certifies only a handful as being fully accessible .
One challenge is that technology often evolves much faster than the guidelines that ensure Web sites work well with screen readers .
In December , the World Wide Web Consortium , an Internet standards group , released Version 2.0 of its accessibility guidelines for Web sites .
The previous version dated back to 1999 , when the Web consisted largely of static Web pages rather than interactive applications .
Obstacles on the Web take many forms .
A common one is the Captcha , a security feature consisting of a string of distorted letters and numbers that users are supposed to read and retype before they register for a new service or send e-mail .
Few Web sites offer audio Captchas .
Some pages are just poorly designed , like e-commerce sites where the “ checkout ” button is an image that is n’t labeled so screen readers can find it .
Did Paul McCartney just pull back the curtain on the upcoming Beatles music game under development by Rock Band impresarios Harmonix ?
In the newest issue of Entertainment Weekly , the legendary musician revealed that the Beatles game will follow the exploits of the Fab Four over their storied careers .
According to McCartney , " It will feature different periods of the band -- you get early days , Liverpool , then psychedelic , and on from there .
It 's very cool .
And I like the idea that the game introduces kids to music , you know ?
" Sounds like the former Beatle is pretty hip to videogames as a means of introducing music to new audiences ( although , not all gamers are kids , Sir McCartney ) .
So , it seems the Beatles game will drift from the clean - cut days of " Help ! " and " A Hard Day 's Night " into the more experimental sounds of " Sgt. Pepper " and " Yellow Submarine . "
Will the game feature stages set in such important locations as Abbey Road Studios the rooftop of the Apple building ?
Quick , somebody ask McCartney before a Harmonix publicist gets a hold of him .
Archie Abrameit , the manager of the Stiles Farm Foundation , a state - owned farm of 2,900 acres near Thrall , said the parched soil thwarted the winter wheat from coming up .
Farmers have no hope that the spring crops will do better , since not even wild plants are sprouting .
“ We make the joke we ca n’t even grow weeds this winter , ” Mr. Abrameit said .
As a result , farmers have found themselves playing a guessing game .
Does one plant corn now and hope for rain , or wait for rain , hoping it comes in time to plant sorghum ?
Or wait still later and plant cotton , which can be grown until later in the summer ?
Some admit privately that they will plant knowing the crop will fail in hopes of collecting insurance .
Others say they may not plant at all .
“ The clock is ticking as far as coming up to planting time , ” said Terrell Hamann , who farms 1,800 acres near Taylor , just northeast of Austin .
“ I change my mind about three times a day about what to do . ”
Complicating the calculus for farmers and ranchers , prices for grain and beef have dropped , as people across the country have cut their spending in the economic crisis .
At the Brown Ranch in Beeville , about 85 miles southeast of San Antonio , the family is bracing for what could be a terrible year .
So far , Mr. Brown and his son , Austin Brown III , have kept their 2,000 head of Angus , Hereford and Akaushi cattle watered by pumping well water into troughs , at great cost in electric bills .
They have also dipped into the ranch ’s savings to buy hundreds of bales of hay and hundreds of pounds cottonseed “ cake , ” dense protein - rich pellets , to feed the animals .
As the younger Mr. Brown spread the cottonseed cake on the ground on a recent afternoon , a hungry mob of Hereford cows chased after his truck , jostling and bumping one another .
The ground was devoid of green life as far as the eye could see .
The cows and their calves had devoured a towering roll of hay left for them but could find nothing to forage .
In an interview with The Guardian , Sony Europe president Sony Computer Entertainment Europe revealed that the company will swap out cell chips in the PlayStation 3 to reduce production costs later this year .
In lieu of huge quarterly losses , Sony has already begun to slim down its staff and manufacturing base by cutting over 16,000 jobs and closing six production centers .
As one of the company 's most notable products , the PlayStation 3 represents a significant portion of the company 's manufacturing operations , and according to Reeves , will likely be undergoing some revisions later this year .
Among the revisions will be a swap from the PS3's current 65 nanometer cell chip with a smaller , more cost effective 45 nanometer cell chip .
"
We 're always looking at ways to reduce costs , " said Reeves .
" Replacing the current 65 nanometre cell chip with a 45 nanometre one probably in middle of year .
" What does the new chip mean for the system ?
Well , the 45 nm chip has a higher energy efficiency and runs cooler than the current 65 nm chip .
Additionally , the chip will make the overall production costs lower on the system , potentially paving the way for future price reductions .
But do n't get too excited , PS3 price reductions wo n't be happening anytime soon , during the interview Reeves maintained that resisting the urge to cut prices is crucial to Sony 's economic rebound .
For all the latest , stay tuned to IGN Gear .
The problems are multiplied as the number of chips increases Computer processor manufacturer Intel have revealed details of a patent for protecting future generations of computers from the growing threat of cosmic rays .
The company has designed an on - chip cosmic ray detector to try to cope with the particles , which originate in space before sporadically entering the Earth 's atmosphere and going through everything they encounter .
Because the operation of computers is through charged particles , the unpredictable hits from the rays are problematic , potentially causing the system to crash .
" What happens is if a cosmic ray causes a collision inside the silicon chip , that releases lots of charged particles , " Intel 's senior scientist Eric Hannah told BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme .
" All our logic is based on charge , so it gets interference . "
' Bigger disturb '
The risk from cosmic rays may not be thought of as a big problem on a single computer with a single chip , as there is the potential for error only perhaps every several years .
But Mr Hannah explained that on a supercomputer with 10,000 chips , there was the potential for 10 or 20 faults a week .
And the risk of cosmic ray interference will only increase as chips get smaller .
This is because circuits will require less charge per switch to operate .
You could be going down the autobahn at 200 miles an hour and suddenly discover your anti-lock braking system does n't work because it had a cosmic ray event
Eric Hannah
Since the amount of charge from cosmic rays will remain the same , there will be a " bigger disturb , " Mr Hannah explained .
And this is potentially a problem not just for PCs and supercomputers , but anything with computer - operated parts - for example cars .
" You could be going down the autobahn at 200 miles an hour and suddenly discover your anti-lock braking system does n't work because it had a cosmic ray event , " Mr Hannah said .
" It 's strange , but this is the reality we 're moving into as we get smaller and smaller circuits . "
The cosmic ray detector is therefore designed to spot when rays have caused interference and then tell the chip to repeat the command .
" Everyone else was trying to do it with circuit resistance and more robust designs , or looking at the architecture , " said Mr Hannah .
" I looked at it and said , ' that 's a lot of energy being deposited in a short amount of time , and if you could detect that event with a cosmic ray detector . '
" Being a physicist it did n't look too hard to me - we could simply say , ' you were just hit by a cosmic ray , you may want to redo that calculation ' . "
He said that discussions are now under way within Intel about how to build such a detector and see how it works .
But he admitted that it will be hard to say when such a device may become a practical reality .
Such devices are " not too easily built , " he said , and required a way to build , for example , very small microphones .
" It 's hard to say when it might or might not hit a product , " he added .

What are these ?
The liberals are at it again .
In a new bill introduced the first day of present session of Congress , and with zero coverage from the MSM , H.R. 45 ( Blair Holt 's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 ) targets all gun owners in the U.S.A .
This nefarious bill seeks to strip us all of our Constitutional Rights to possess and bear firearms of any distinction .
It requires , within the first two years , that all new guns be registered .
The bill goes retroactive after two years .
Meaning that two years after the passage of the bill , ALL FIREARMS in a citizen ’s possession must be registered , not just those purchased after the bill passes , and this apparently applies to antique firearms as well .
Every five years the firearm owner must go through a complete renewal process for each weapon owned .
Failure to comply carries stiff penalties including confiscation of the firearms and jail time ( penalties as high as ten years imprisonment in some cases ) .
The bill also authorizes government searches without warrant , the creation of a federal bureaucracy to monitor firearm possession , etc .
The following is a summary of the bill as provided by the Congressional Research Service .
If you read the whole bill , you 'll find it will effectively preclude the ownership of any firearms by law - abiding people unless directly licensed by the Attorney General
1/6/2009 --Introduced .
Blair Holt 's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
Act to prohibit a person from possessing a firearm unless that person has been issued a firearm license under this Act or a state system certified under this Act and such license has not been invalidated or revoked .
Prescribes license application , issuance , and renewal requirements .
Prohibits transferring or receiving a qualifying firearm unless the recipient presents a valid firearms license , the license is verified , and the dealer records a tracking authorization number .
Prescribes firearms transfer reporting and record keeping requirements .
Directs the Attorney General to establish and maintain a federal record of sale system .
Prohibits : ( 1 ) transferring a firearm to any person other than a licensee , unless the transfer is processed through a licensed dealer in accordance with national instant criminal background check system requirements , with exceptions ; ( 2 ) licensed manufacturer or dealer from failing to comply with reporting and record keeping requirements of this Act ;
( 3 ) failing to report the loss or theft of the firearm to the Attorney General within 72 hours ; ( 4 ) failing to report to the Attorney General an address change within 60 days ; ( 5 )
keeping a loaded firearm , or an unloaded firearm and ammunition for the firearm , knowingly or recklessly disregarding the risk that a child is capable of gaining access , if a child uses the firearm and causes death or serious bodily injury .
Prescribes criminal penalties for violations of firearms provisions covered by this Act. Directs the Attorney General to : ( 1 ) establish and maintain a firearm injury information clearinghouse ; ( 2 ) conduct continuing studies and investigations of firearm - related deaths and injuries ; and ( 3 ) collect and maintain current production and sales figures of each licensed manufacturer .
Authorizes the Attorney General to certify state firearm licensing or record of sale systems .
Like all other threats against our freedoms , we must rise and defeat this bill , slap it down hard .
Now the iPod can answer the question : Am iDrunk ?
A new product called the iBreath turns Apple Inc.'s iPod into an alcohol breathalyzer .
The $ 79 accessory plugs into the base of the iPod and functions like a field sobriety test .
The person using the iBreath exhales into a retractable “ blow wand ” and the internal sensor measures the blood - alcohol content .
Within two seconds , it displays the results on an LED screen .
A reading of 0.08 or above sets off an alarm , signaling a blood - alcohol level above the legal limit in all 50 states .
“ We are absolutely not advocating drinking and driving , but we know that people just do n’t observe that , ” said Don Bassler , chief executive and founder of David Steele Enterprises Inc. in Newport Beach , an online retailer and creator of the iBreath .
“ We do n’t want people to think that this makes it all OK , but it ’s a safety device that we hope people will use , and it may save lives . ”

The iBreath is among a growing number of products for the iPod and iPhone designed to combat excessive holiday reveling .
Last Call , a new application for the iPhone , provides a tool for estimating blood - alcohol content ( as well as a list of attorneys who specialize in DUI arrests ) .
Another iPhone application , Drunk Dial , prevents people from making calls they might regret in the morning by administering a timed math test .
And Taxi Magic hails a cab with a push of a button .
The service , which connects the iPhone directly to computer dispatch systems , is available in 25 cities across the U.S. , including Los Angeles .
The Los Angeles Police Department has stepped up sobriety checkpoints to combat drunk driving over the holidays .
The department charged more than 7,000 drivers with driving under the influence last year .
It said drunk drivers were involved in 2,823 collisions .
Bassler said he got the idea for the iBreath from conversations with friends , who expressed concern about their older children attending parties and drinking alcohol .

“ You know how they are -- they ’re going to sneak it if they can .
They do n’t listen to their parents , but they listen to their iPods , ” Bassler said .
He said one friend suggested , “ Would n’t it be great for these kids to have breathalyzer iPods ? ’
I said , ‘ Hey , there ’s a product there . ’ ”
Bassler spent a year and a half developing the iBreath and gaining the seal of approval from Apple , indicating that the accessory is compatible with the iPod Nano , the iPod Classic and the iPod Touch .
It will also work with the iPhone , he said .
The hope is that the iPod ’s cool factor will take away some of the stigma of acting responsibly and using a breathalyzer , Bassler said .
That ’s also why the device doubles as an FM transmitter for broadcasting tunes on the iPod to an unused radio frequency , to listen to music in the car .
Advertisement
“ We figured , OK , if it ’s only a breathalyzer , the chances are this thing is coming off the iPod and sitting in the drawer , ” Bassler said .
“ If we put in the FM transmitter , they might keep it on there . ”
Advocacy groups working to combat drunk driving worry that the iBreath might promote binge drinking and create a false sense of security .
Laura Dean-Mooney , national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , said she worried that young people would use the breathalyzer for drinking games , to see who could score the highest reading .
( The iBreath caps readings at 0.20 , more than twice the legal definition of intoxication . )
Moreover , Dean - Mooney questions the accuracy of the device .
Law enforcement agents use instruments that are calibrated monthly , and accurate readings require the person taking a field sobriety test to blow “ deep lung air , ” she said .
iBreath claims to offer results in as little as five seconds within 0.01 % accuracy .

“ I ’m afraid it not only causes young people to use it as a training tool but also gives them a false sense of security .
‘ I ’m good to go , ’ ” Dean - Mooney said .
“ Your blood - alcohol content goes up for 30 minutes after you stop drinking . ”
The best solution , she said , is to designate a sober driver before drinking begins , or take public transportation .
“ There ’s no need to risk hurting yourself or other innocent people when you can simply plan ahead , ” Dean - Mooney said .

Like a giant cardboard box lying in the middle of an otherwise orderly secret underground base 's hallways , the release of Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots was hard to miss .
Konami today released its financial results for the first half of its fiscal year , and the PlayStation 3 exclusive title had a definite impact .
For the six months ended September 30 , Konami posted net profits of nearly ¥ 12 billion ( $ 122 million ) , up more than 90 percent year - over - year .
While the bottom line was up big , the overall revenue increase for the publisher was more modest .
Konami posted total sales of ¥ 146.9 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) , up a little less than 10 percent over the ¥ 133.7 billion ( not quite $ 1.4 billion ) it posted for the previous fiscal year 's first half .
Konami also updated its sales figures for Metal Gear Solid 4 , saying the game has now sold more than 4 million copies since its worldwide release in June .
As with many games , the pace of Metal Gear Solid 4 sales dropped steeply after its initial launch window .
More than 3 million of the game 's sales came in its first two weeks on shelves .
Interestingly , the geographic breakdown of Konami 's sales changed significantly for the first half of its fiscal year .
The publisher actually sold fewer games in Japan than it did during the same period last year ( 4.05 million , down from 4.57 million ) , while sales ballooned in North America ( 1.16 million to 4.05 million ) and Europe ( 2.06 million to 3.49 million ) .
Bose Introduces Energy - Efficient Sound System for Chevy Volt
February 23rd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Chalk up another reason to buy the Chevy Volt in 2011 : a powerful , compact , energy - efficient sound system from Bose .
According to the company , the system is 30 % smaller , 40 % lighter , and uses 50 % less energy than conventional Bose sound systems .
The system uses “ advanced switching amplification , high motor force speakers and proprietary control circuitry ” to cut power use in half .
At the same time , the sound system retains Bose control circuitry to create concert hall - quality sound .
Chevrolet ’s Volt — a plug - in hybrid vehicle — is scheduled to begin production in 2010 .

11 How to Use Kitchen Scissors
This guide is there to save those of us who did n't take those scissors operation classes in college .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Most Important Step :
Step 2 : " Put the scissors in the kitchen in an easily accessible place . "
Well , that makes sense .
Because despite being the best place to store stuff , it turns out it would be a pain in the ass to run to the attic every time you needed your kitchen scissors .
The article goes on to recommend situations where your newfangled kitchen scissors can come in handy .
Such as :
" Chopping up whole tomatoes from a can . "
Okay , they 're clearly fucking with us at this point .
You 've got some poor sap who needs an Internet guide to use scissors , and you 're going to set them to cutting " whole tomatoes " with them ?
That 's like making hood surfing part of the driver 's test .

Also , " Cutting pizza wedges . "
No , WikiHow .
Just fucking no .
Most Important Tip :
Under the " Things You 'll Need " heading , the first bullet point is " kitchen scissors . "
See , this is what the Internet should be for , people .
Most Important Warning :
" To avoid the temptation of using the kitchen scissors for cutting paper or any other household object beyond kitchen preparation , it is a helpful idea to place a second pair of scissors in an accessible location that will stop others from taking off with the kitchen pair . "
That 's right .
Because the biggest concern regarding kitchen scissors would have to be the temptation involved .
Forget the midget hooker with the bottle of Jose , because we 're really not sure we can resist cutting out paper snowflakes with our exclusive - ass kitchen scissors .

When times are tough , the tough plant victory gardens !
[ Digging a Victory Garden .

Last Thursday , Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack began turning a stretch of pavement at the Department of Agriculture into a garden .
They dedicated the land on the 200th anniversary of the USDA founder ’s birth : Abraham Lincoln .
Not only are they working on a garden at USDA headquarters , but Vilsack announced plans to start community gardens at all USDA offices across the globe !
Is this the Obama administration ’s answer to petitions from Eat the View and the WHO Farm on Change.org ?
At the dedication , Vilsack said :
It is essential for the federal government to lead the way in enhancing and conserving our land and water resources .
President Obama has expressed his commitment to responsible stewardship of our land , water and other natural resources , and one way of restoring the land to its natural condition is what we are doing here today – “ breaking pavement ” for The People ’s Garden .
I ’d still love to see all of that thirsty grass on the White House lawn transformed into a food garden , but this is a wonderful start !
The project will transform 1,250 square feet of unnecessary paved surface at the USDA headquarters into green space , and they ’re doing it responsibly , too !
Each garden ’s design will promote sustainability by example .
They ’re planning to build and landscape to retain water and reduce runoff , include green roofs , and stick to native plants .
Way to lead by example !
There are all sorts of benefits to planting a garden :
Even growing just a small portion of their own food can help families cope with rising food prices .
More home - grown fruits and veggies means less processed food at the table , and possibly avoiding some of the food contamination scares we ’ve been seeing lately !
Getting your kids involved in the garden encourages them to eat those fruits and veggies .
Planting a garden is an easy , fun way to lower your carbon footprint by cutting back on those food miles , too !
Do you have your own food garden ?
How has it affected the way you eat ?

And now we are suppose to fawn all over you .
We are suppose to act like it 's so incredibly difficult to get pregnant , and that you are now this pristine chalice of life - Something that deserves to be worshiped and adored .
Feel sick in the mornings ?
Do your feet hurt cause they are swelling ?
Gotta buy new clothes because you are 12 weeks along and have already put on 19 pounds ?
NOT MY PROBLEM .
Do your job like you are suppose to and shut the hell up already .
… Oh btw - Quit using your pregnancy as an excuse to stuff your gullet each and every chance you get .
When you proudly stand up at the staff party and announce that " The baby wants " an entire pint of Ben & Jerry 's Super Fudge Chunk , a liter of Dr. Pepper , some curly fries THEN TELL THE BABY TO SHUT THE FUCK UP .
Now what exactly do I have to look forward to for the next two or three years ..?
A constant stream of verbal diarrhea such as " little Bobby went to the toilet and pooped all by himself - But he forgot to wipe and then sat on the floor to pull his pants up !
It was so precious , but there was poop everywhere ! " or “ I 'm sorry I 'm 40 minutes late , you see I have a four - year - old in potty training and we had an accident . " or " I do n't feel comfortable doing the speed limit , my baby is only two months old - You can go around . "
FUCK YOU .
Two years after that and now I 'm stuck behind you at the concession stand - And guess what ?
You feel it 's important to empower your child .
It does n't matter that there are nine people behind you , you want little Bobby to make his own choice when it comes to artificially flavored processed movie snacks .
By God , Bobby is special .
He must be because that ’s what all the Nike commercials say .
There is only one Bobby and he is different from every other person on this earth .
He is special by God , and he will be raised knowing he is special .
And now , little Bobby has been standing there with his little index finger in his little mouth , staring at all the choices for the last FULL minute .
But you are n't the type of parent to acknowledge the fact that many people are waiting for little Bobby to make up his little mind .
You do n't say something like " Hurry and choose something or I will choose for you " or even better “ Other people are waiting , make up your mind ” - Not you .
Instead , you turn to the sea of humanity that has formed a marginally cohesive line behind you and look at them with an ' I 'm sure you all understand ' look .
FUCK YOU .
You are the same people that just can't put their cell phone conversation on hold for 20 seconds while you order your venti no - whip - half - caff almond latte and spinach croissant - Instead you make eye contact with the waiter and raise that index finger .
The index finger which happens to be the international signal for ' I am a socially retarded fuckhead .

One time I saw an interview with Hootie ( of the Blowfish ) , with his wife .
It was a lovely ' What does Hootie and his wife do when he's at home and not packing fans into concerts at 20 or 30 % of capacity ' piece on some lame ass afternoon news biopic show .
Anyway Hootie ’s wife starts talking about kids and how they are such a miracle and ( now she is actually tearing up ) and she just can't understand how anyone would n't want to have children and HOW SHE JUST FEELS SORRY FOR THOSE PEOPLE .
Oh yes honey , feel sorry for us .
Obviously we are emotionally fractured because we do n't share the same fervent desire to add our particular goo to this world 's collective semen cesspool ... I do n't hate children .
I hate the parents that think they are entitled because they have children ...

Nutrient - rich , oxygen - starved dead zones in coastal areas have been steadily growing in the past few decades .
But the problem is not restricted to coastal waters .
As a new study published in ES&T ( DOI 10.1021/es801217q ) shows , freshwater bodies throughout the U.S. are also polluted with excess nitrogen and phosphorus .
Such pollution is costing the country a significant amount of money : at least $ 4 billion is lost annually as a result of the degradation of freshwater sources , the authors conclude .
To understand the true extent of nutrient pollution in freshwater bodies , ecologist Walter Dodds and his colleagues at Kansas State University examined the data on nitrogen and phosphorus levels in water bodies throughout the country collected by the U.S. EPA .
Ecologists have broadly divided the U.S. by ecoregions on the basis of geography , geology , vegetation , and human impacts .
The authors found that 90 % of rivers in 12 out of the 14 regions contained excessive nitrogen and phosphorus , compared with reference nutrient levels calculated in several previous studies .
The average total nitrogen was 5.5 times greater and the total phosphorus 3 times higher than median reference levels , Dodds found .
The environmental impacts of nutrient pollution are widely acknowledged by scientists and regulators .
EPA has developed water - quality criteria for nitrogen and phosphorus pollution , and states are working on plans to tackle the problem .
But given that the major contributors to this pollution are nonpoint sources , individual states and EPA have had less success in regulating these sources than they have had with point sources of pollution .
Nutrient pollution remains a persistent problem throughout most of the country , but its economic impacts are less studied .
The authors of the new study calculated the monetary damages of such pollution in the U.S. by looking at the following four factors : losses in lakefront property values , reduced fishing and other recreational activities on lakes , cost of biodiversity loss , and cost of purifying drinking water .
Estimation of damages required an extensive data hunt — the authors gathered numbers from various federal and regional agencies , water - treatment facilities , and survey reports .
For example , to calculate the cost of biodiversity loss , the authors traced the amount of money spent under the U.S. Endangered Species Act .
Using previously published estimates that 25 % of aquatic endangered and threatened species are imperiled because of eutrophication , the authors found that the U.S. spends $ 44 million per year to protect species from the impacts of nutrient pollution .
Together , the potential losses amounted to more than $ 4.3 billion every year , and these costs are borne by agencies , drinking - water facilities , and citizens .
When clean drinking water is unavailable , people pay for bottled water .
When lakes are closed because of odor or water - quality problems , local economies lose money because fewer people spend money on recreation .
“ This analysis is extremely important because the U.S. is very limited by freshwater right now , ” says Stephen Carpenter , a zoologist with the University of Wisconsin .
To use water wisely in the near future , we need to understand the costs associated with this scarce resource , he says .
But the values in the study are “ strikingly low , ” he adds .
Dodds and his coauthors agree .
“ Our valuation is likely an underestimate , ” they write .
For example , they could n’t assign economic costs to rivers , because “ there is a much weaker link between the level of nutrients in the water and when people stop recreating , ” or when property values drop or taste and odor problems develop , Dodds says .
Gaps in data also prevented them from calculating the economic damages from dead zones in the Great Lakes and in coastal areas , he adds .
These costs are usually disregarded as externalities , says Jason Hill , a research associate in the University of Minnesota ’s department of applied economics .
Externalities or external costs are not directly borne by those creating the problem .
For example , farmers or people making economic decisions about agricultural products regard the costs of environmental damage from agriculture as externalities .
But , to compare alternative ways of producing food or fuel , for example , “ you need to understand both direct costs that producers pay ... and external costs absorbed by society , ” says Hill .
“ What I really liked about this paper is that they are trying to quantify and value some of the externalities . ”
The new study suggests that “ it ’s cheaper to prevent pollution than to clean it up , ” says Jules Pretty , an environmental scientist at the University of Essex ’s Center for Environment and Society ( U.K. ) .
It is a good reminder that “ ecosystem services are the hidden value in the world economy , and the costs to the environment are a kind of toxic debt . ”
Today , the world is grappling with an enormous credit crunch , he adds .
But “ the real credit crunch is that we ’re borrowing from the environment .
[ And ] those costs will still have to be paid by our children and our children ’s children , ” he says .

I actually have another story :
A few years past my FCopy " success " story , I was approached by someone who asked me if I could crack a slot machine 's software .
This was in Germany , where almost every pub had one or two of those :
You'd throw some money in what amounts to about a US quarter , then it would spin three wheels and if you got lucky with some pattern , you 'd then have the choice to " double or nothing " your win on the next play , or get the current win .
The goal of the play was to try to double your win a few times until you 'd get in the " series " mode where any succeeding win , no matter how minor , would get you a big payment ( of about 10 times your spending per game ) .
The difficulty was to know when to double and when not .
For an " outsider " this was completely random , of course .
But it turned out that those German - made machines were using simple pseudo - randomized tables in their ROMs .
Now , if you watched the machine play for a few rounds , you 'd could figure out where this " random table pointer " was and predict its next move .
That way , a player would know when to double and when to pass , leading him eventually to the " big win series " .
Now , this was already a common thing when this person approached me .
There was an underground scene which had access to the ROMs in those machines , find the tables and create software for computers such as a C - 64 to use for prediction of the machine 's next moves .
Then came a new type of machine , though , which used a different algorithm : Instead of using pre-calc 'd tables , it did something else and none of the resident crackers could figure that out .
So I was approached , being known as a sort of genius since my FCopy fame .
So I got the ROMs .
16KB , as usual .
No information on what it did and how it worked whatsoever .
I was on my own .
Even the code did n't look familiar ( I knew 6502 and 8080 by then only ) .
After some digging and asking , I found it was a 6809 ( which I found to be the nicest 8 bit CPU to exist , and which had analogies to the 680x0 CPU design , which was much more linear than the x86 family 's instruction mess ) .
By that time , I had already a 68000 computer ( I worked for the company " Gepard Computer " which built and sold such a machine , with its own developer OS and , all ) and was into programming Modula - 2 .
So I wrote a disassembler for the 6809 , one that helped me with reverse engineering by finding subroutines , jumps , etc .
Slow I got a an idea of the flow control of the slot machine 's program .
Eventually I found some code that looked like a mathmatical algorithm and it dawned on me that this could be the random generating code .
As I never had a formal education in computer sciences , up to then I had no idea how a typical randomgen using mul , add and mod worked .
But I remember seeing something mentioned in a Modula - 2 book and then realized what it was .
Now I could quickly find the code that would call this randomgen and learn which " events " lead to a randomgen iteration , meaning I knew how to predict the next iterations and their values during a game .
What was left was to figure out the current position of the randomgen .
I had never been good with abstract things such as algebra .
I knew someone who studied math and was a programmer too , though .
When I called him , he quickly knew how to solve the problem and quabbled a lot about how simple it would be to determine the randomgen 's seed value .
I understood nothing .
Well , I understood one thing :
The code to accomplish this would take a lot of time , and that a C - 64 or any other 8 bit computer would take hours if not days for it .
Thus , I decided to offer him 1000 DM ( which was a lot of money for me back then ) if he could write me an assembler routine in 68000 .
Did n't take him long and I had the code which I could test on my 68000 computer .
It took usually between 5 and 8 minutes , which was acceptable .
So I was almost there .
It still required a portable 68000 computer to be carried to the pub where the slot machine stands .
My Gepard computer was clearly not of the portable type .
Luckly , someone else I knew in Germany produced entire 68000 computers on a small circuit board .
For I / O it only had serial comms ( RS - 232 ) and a parallel port ( Centronics was the standard of those days ) .
I could hook up some 9V block battieries to it to make it work .
Then I bought a Sharp pocket computer , which had a rubber keyboard and a single - line 32 chars display .
Running on batteries , which was my terminal .
It had a RS - 232 connector which I connected to the 68000 board .
The Sharp also had some kind of non-volatile memory , which allowed me to store the 68000 random - cracking software on the Sharp , transfer it on demand to the 68000 computer , which then calculated the seed value .
Finally I had a small Centronics printer which printed on narrow thermo paper ( which was the size of what cash registers use to print receipts ) .
Hence , once the 68000 had the results , it would send a row of results for the upcoming games on the slot machine to the Sharp , which printed them on paper .
So , to empty one of these slot machines , you 'd work with two people :
You start playing , write down its results , one you had the minimum number of games required for the seed calculation , one of you would go to the car parked outside , turn on the Sharp , enter the results , it would have the 68000 computer rattle for 8 minutes , and out came a printed list of upcoming game runs .
Then all you needed was this tiny piece of paper , take it back to your buddy , who kept the machine occupied , align the past results with the printout and no more than 2 minutes later you were " surprised " to win the all - time 100s series .
You'd then play these 100 games , practically emptying the machine ( and if the machine was empty before the 100 games were played , you had the right to wait for it to be refilled , maybe even come back next day , whereas the machine was stopped until you came back ) .
This was n't Las Vegas , so you 'd only get about 400 DM out of a machine that way , but it was quick and sure money , and it was exciting .
Some pub owners suspected us of cheating but had nothing against us due to the laws back then , and even when some called the police , the police was in favor of us ) .
Of course , the slot making company soon got wind of this and tried to counteract , turning off those particular machines until new ROMs were installed .
But the first few times they only changed the randomgen 's numbers .
We only had to get hold of the new ROMs , and it took me a few minutes to find the new numbers and implement them into my software .
So this went on for a while during which me and friends browsed thru pubs of several towns in Germany looking for those machines only we could crack .
Eventually , though , the machine maker learned how to " fix " it : Until then , the randomgen was only advanced at certain predictable times , e.g. something like 4 times during play , and once more per the player 's pressing of the " double or nothing " button .
But then they finally changed it so that the randomgen would continually be polled , meaning we were no longer able to predict the next seed value exactly on time for the pressing of the button .
That was the end of it .
Still , making the effort of writing a disassembler just for this single crack , finding the key routines in 16KB of 8 bit CPU code , figuring out unknown algorithms , investing quite a lot of money to pay someone else to develop code I did n't understand , finding the items for a portable high - speed computer involving the " blind " 68000 CPU with the Sharp as a terminal and the printer for the convenient output , and then actually emptying the machines myself , was one of the most exciting things I ever did with my programming skills .

It plants over half of the United States ’ fruits , vegetables , and nuts .
The GDP of the United States per capita is on an uptrend .
One of the US economy facts that shows you how big it is :
The US GDP per capita has steadily increased over the years .
The Latin term per capita translates to “ for each head , ” meaning that it represents the total GDP distributed per each person in its population .

The United States is not the richest country in the world .
Despite having the world ’s biggest economy , the United States is not the richest country in the world per capita .
The U.S. only ranks at the 10th place , leaving Qatar as the richest country on the planet with $ 130,475 GDP per capita compared to the U.S. with only $ 65,000 .
Like most countries in the world , wealth is not equally distributed in the U.S.
One of the main reasons why the United States is not the richest country in the world per capita is huge income gaps .
There are massive disparities in minimum wages and those who are very wealthy .
The Federal Reserve is the " biggest financial influence " not just in the US , but in the world .
The monetary policy is the monetary authority of a country that controls either the interest rate .
It is managed by the Federal Reserve which is guided by the current Federal Reserve Chairman , Jerome Powell .
The Federal Reserve ’s instruments include the money supply , fed funds rate and the use of credit .
These instruments control how interest rates affect the United States ’ economy as well as other country ’s economies .

The Federal Reserve adjusts the interests depending on the needs of the economy .
Interest rates are the key indicators of an economy ’s growth .
When the Federal Reserve offers low - interest rates , it is expected to drive growth and positivity on the part of borrowers , while stimulating the economy as well .
So why not make the interest low all the time ?
In contrast , a high - interest rate will help the economy avoid overproduction dead ends as well as asset bubbles since it “ discourages ” everyone to borrow .
The US Treasury bond provides beefs - up the economy .
A US Treasury bond is a special kind of bond issued by the government of the United States and they will use the proceeds for its initiatives accordingly .
When a fund manager or even individuals purchase a Treasury bond , they are loaning money to the US government .
Although historically it yields less compare to the stocks , it is a solid way to preserve the capital because you know that the government will pay its debts regardless of the economy ’s status .

California has been warned it could run out of cash by the end of February
Cash - strapped California is to start notifying 20,000 state workers that they may lose their jobs .
A spokesman for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made the announcement after California lawmakers failed to approve a $ 40 bn ( £ 28.2 bn ) budget .
California , the world 's eighth biggest economy , has been hit by the housing crisis , unemployment and falling consumer spending .
The jobs on the government payroll would be cut in June .
It would be done in preparation for the next fiscal year , which starts in July .
" In the absence of a budget , the governor has a responsibility to realise state savings any way he can , " said Aaron McLear , a spokesman for Republican governor Schwarzenegger .
" This is unfortunately a necessary decision . "
The budget would include spending cuts and tax increases to close the state 's budget deficit .
California has already laid off state workers for two days a month , put 2,000 public projects on hold and delayed tax refunds .
The state controller predicts California will run out of cash by the end of February if lawmakers do not solve the budget crisis .
I ’d never imagine I ’d see this argument by anyone , especially by someone who aims to be an authority in tech sector reporting but it seems that ideology trumps facts .
See Techdirt ’s Mike ’s ( I assume Masnick ? ) latest quote :
And , for that matter , I ’d suggest that you ’re wrong in your initial assessment .
Microsoft beat all of the companies you listed above by creating a BETTER PRODUCT .
Lolwut .
Now let ’s see
MS Word VS Wordprerfect
Exchange VS Lotus Notes
Internet Explorer 6 VS Opera
MS - Dos VS DR - Dos
Active Directory VS Novell Netware
There ’s a lot of other products that suffered the same fate because of the way MS “ competes ” which has nothing to do with building better products .
Indeed all tech experts were scratching their head how an upstart competitor with a clearly inferior product could be winning market share against his well entrenched opponents .
The answer of course is by anti-competitive tactics , which is to say , by doing anything else except building a better product .
If there ’s anything to be said about Microsoft products is that they have always been second class with a lot of bugs features that nobody wanted .
And yet , they win .
Still , Techdirt seems unable to recognise this fact .
This can only be because free market idealism has clouded their minds so much that monopolies and shady practices do n’t even register .
No , everything is fair competition as far as they ’re concerned .
But this is of course a fallacious reasoning as their argument goes like this .
Products / Companies in the free marketwho gain market space do so by building better products
Microsoft is gaining market space
Therefore Microsoft must be building better products .
Of course this is patently ridiculous , as the very first premise is wrong .
Companies have many means in their disposal to gain market space that do n’t involve building better products .
From using your monopolistic market share to strong arm your allies to drop the competitor ’s products , to setting fire to the other ’s stores .
Wether Microsoft is gaining or losing market share is does not tell us anything about the quality of their products or their tactics from the very simple fact that correlation does not equal causation .
To find out what is causing this , you need to look deeper into practices and product comparisons , something which Techdirt is apparently unwilling to do and much prefers the lazy way out .

The “ Obamameter ” is the St. Petersburg Times new tool for following President Obama ’s progress on completing his campaign promises .
It ’s very cute and handy , but is it any more reliable than the president ?
While checking in to the site this afternoon , I came across this in the “ Promise Kept ” section : “ No. 125 : Direct military leaders to end war in Iraq . ”
Needless to say , my jaw dropped .
Did I miss something super important when I compiled my daily casualty report this morning ?
Should I run out and pick up a hard copy of the newspaper in hopes of seeing “ IRAQ WAR ENDS ” as the headline ?
Or should I just dig into this “ promise kept ” a little bit further ?
As evidence of a kept promise , the paper quoted Obama as saying , “ on my first day in office , I would give the military a new mission : ending this war ” and re-ran a story on Obama ’s historic meeting with military officials .
Okay , so that is vaguely true , but is it what the public was hoping for ?
A meeting that , even a month later , has given us no new , concrete plans ?
President Bush undercut that promise anyway , when gave us the SOFA agreement that forces U.S. combat troops out by the end of 2011 .
I was expecting more at this point in the administration .
Heck , the Obama has n’t even bothered to get a new Defense Secretary yet .
Obama in the same op - ed piece wrote , “ [ we ] can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months . ”
That particular sentence , I believe , is what lured many voters to pull Obama ’s knob in the voter ’s booth .
But , as of this morning , he is still considering a 23 - month timelineâ € ” and the drawdown in Iraq would be mostly to feed the Afghanistan surge instead of ending U.S. warmongering .
Thankfully , the Times has the 16 - month timeline as their next campaign promise , but if you are looking just in the “ Promises Kept ” section , you get the phony impression that Obama has done something to speed up the end of the war .
At least that ’s what I thought at first .
I do n’t know if the Obamameter ’s editors meant to be intellectually dishonest â€ ” I actually do n’t think so â€ ” but we have to stay on top the media and the President if this endless is ever to actually end .
Unfortunately , President Obama has also apparently kept the following promise : “ No . 134 : Send two additional brigades to Afghanistan . ”
We have to do something about that too .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
The front page of The Washington Post screams , “ Obama Is Under Fire Over Panetta Selection . ”
The article notes that “ current and former intelligence officials expressed sharp resentment over Obama ’s choice of Leon E. Panetta as CIA director . ”
CQPolitics.com blogger and national security journalist Jeff Stein , quoting a former CIA operations veteran , reports that the rank - and - file reaction to Panetta at the CIA has been “ overwhelmingly negative . ”
Stein notes that many CIA field people are n’t keen on bringing an intelligence establishment outsider into the CIA and would rather have someone who knows the nitty - gritty of spy work running the place –though Stein does report that “ a number of former top CIA officials ” have told him that Panetta could be a good choice , given that he can be expected to have the standing within the Obama administration to bring effective leadership to the agency .
I asked a former top CIA official who had served not too long ago to share his / her view of the Panetta pick .
S/he would only do so if not identified .
I know it ’s often unsatisfying to read a long quote from an unnamed source .
But his / her perspective is interesting enough to merit presenting the full response .
Let me add that this person is savvy in both the ways of Langley and Washington :
I was expecting to be surprised … and I was .
It seems to me to be a reasonably good one pick given the cards they had dealt themselves .
The Obama transition folks massively mishandled the [ onetime contender for CIA chief ] John Brennan situation .
When they caved to a little outside pressure [ which resulted from Brennan ’s previous association with the CIA ’s so - called enhanced interrogation procedures ] and forced him to remove himself from consideration — they ended up ruling out a whole class of potential candidates .
( i.e. anyone who had served in a position of any significance in intelligence in the past 8 years ) .
So then what could they do ?
It would have been bad to pick someone straight off the Hill for the job … which would have signaled overt politicization of the position .
As you undoubtedly know , several current and recently former Members of Congress were lobbying hard for the job — an instant disqualification in my mind .
It also would not have been ideal to pick another retired military guy…given that [ retired Admiral Dennis ]
Blair is going to be [ Director of National Intelligence ] …. it is not good to have all the top intel positions held by retired military ( I know that is what we have now — with McConnell & Hayden — but it is not ideal ) .
So …they got a creative and found someone who is respected around town …. who generally knows how intelligence works ( having seen the product as Clinton ’s Chief of Staff ) … who has run something bigger than a congressional office ( OMB ) … who is familiar with some of the current issues ( having been on the Iraq Study Group ) and who ( from what I hear ) is a pretty good “ people - person ” who should be able to win over the hearts and minds of the Agency workforce .
Panetta will be well - advised to keep in place some of the top current career officials … a process which apparently is in train .
Hopefully he will not come in with a whole cadre of outsiders to help him run the place .
That did n’t work well for Stansfield Turner , John Deutch , or , most colorfully , for Porter Goss .
Clearly , Team Obama shot themselves in the foot with the premature leak of their intention to nominate … pissing of DiFi and Rocky [ Democratic Senators Diane Feinstein and Jay Rockefeller ] .
Unnecessary self - inflicted wound .
I do n’t buy for a minute that Panetta ’s selection signals anything in particular — you see some pundits saying it shows he is going to preside over slashing budgets …. or will be happily subservient to Blair etc .
Seems to me they picked him because he was plausible , time was running out , and there were no actors who play CIA operatives on TV willing to take the job .
I asked this source if Panetta could expect to confront a campaign of leaks from POed CIA people before or after he arrives at CIA HQ .
S/he replied :
Nah … You ’ll see a little sniping here and there from a few knuckleheads …. but if Panetta comes in and tries to win over the workforce … it wo n’t be that hard to do .
Treat the people well … respect what they do …. do n’t try to punish people for trying to honestly serve the previous administration and he ’ll be fine .
On the other hand , if he shows up with a dozen political operatives hell - bent on squaring the place away and “ fixing ” a dysfunctional agency …. he ’ll be back on the walnut farm before the mid-term elections .
I ’m not sure that a covert campaign will not be waged to prevent Panetta ’s confirmation .
And one shoe that has not yet dropped belongs to the Senate Republicans .
Are they eager to go after Panetta ?
After all , do n’t they have to go after at least one of Obama ’s appointments to prove to their grassroots loyalists that they still have some bite ?
The Panetta appointment right now is balanced on a fine line between sure thing and big fight .

Scientists have issued a new warning about climate change after discovering a sudden and dramatic collapse in the amount of carbon emissions absorbed by the Sea of Japan .
The shift has alarmed experts , who blame global warming .
The world 's oceans soak up about 11bn tonnes of human carbon dioxide pollution each year , about a quarter of all produced , and even a slight weakening of this natural process would leave significantly more CO2 in the atmosphere .
That would require countries to adopt much stricter emissions targets to prevent dangerous rises in temperature .
Kitack Lee , an associate professor at Pohang University of Science and Technology , who led the research , says the discovery is the " very first observation that directly relates ocean CO2 uptake change to ocean warming " .
He says the warmer conditions disrupt a process known as " ventilation " - the way seawater flows and mixes and drags absorbed CO2 from surface waters to the depths .
He warns that the effect is probably not confined to the Sea of Japan .
It could also affect CO2 uptake in the Atlantic and Southern oceans .
" Our result in the East Sea unequivocally demonstrated that oceanic uptake of CO2 has been directly affected by warming - induced weakening of vertical ventilation , " he says .
Korea argues that the Sea of Japan should be renamed the East Sea , because it says the former is a legacy of Japan 's military expansion in the region .
Lee adds : " In other words , the increase in atmospheric temperature due to global warming can profoundly influence the ocean ventilation , thereby decreasing the uptake rate of CO2 . "
Working with Pavel Tishchenko of the Russian Pacific Oceanological Institute in Vladivostok , Lee and his colleague Geun - Ha Park used a cruise on the Professor Gagarinskiy , a Russian research vessel , last May to take seawater samples from 24 sites across the Sea of Japan .
They compared the dissolved CO2 in the seawater with similar samples collected in 1992 and 1999 .
The results showed the amount of CO2 absorbed during 1999 to 2007 was half the level recorded from 1992 to 1999 .
Crucially , the study revealed that ocean mixing , a process required to deposit carbon in deep water , where it is more likely to stay , appears to have significantly weakened .
Announcing their results in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , the scientists say : " The striking feature is that nearly all anthropogenic CO2 taken up in the recent period was confined to waters less than 300 metres in depth .
The rapid and substantial reduction ... is surprising and is attributed to considerable weakening of overturning circulation . "
Corinne Le Quéré , an expert in ocean carbon storage at the University of East Anglia , said : " We do n't think the ocean is just going to completely stop taking our carbon dioxide emissions , but if the effect weakens then it has real consequences for the atmosphere . "

However ...
The walker , who was in her 40s , had been following a coastal footpath when she spotted the bird feather and went to pick it up .
A few years ago , the St. Petersburg Times sent reporters out to investigate grouper , the succulent , meaty fish drawn from the Gulf of Mexico .
They bought the fish at restaurants around the Tampa Bay area and had it tested at a DNA laboratory .
Most of it was something else .
Some of it was hake , some of it was pollock .
Some , as the newspaper put it , was " Asian catfish masquerading as grouper . "
The contents of one meal were unidentifiable , even to the DNA technicians .
The Foreclosures R Us bus , Fort Myers , Florida .
( Alan Habbick / CBC )
The stories provoked an uproar and Florida state authorities were forced to step in .
Inspectors did another round of tests and found that just about everybody was passing off cheap fish as the more expensive grouper .
Eventually , fines were paid and the state stopped investigating .
Last year , an identical scam was uncovered further south , in Fort Myers .
Still , just about every restaurant I visited along the Gulf Coast last week was cheerfully offering bargain grouper .
Fried , crusted in pecans , sautéed , baked .
Whatever .
It tasted all right and , anyway , the actual DNA of whatever is on the plate is the least of anybody 's worries nowadays .
Swindled and beaten bloodier than most states by the economic crisis , Florida is lying awake at night like a terrified cardiac patient , praying the angina will pass .
The confidence games here were ruinous .
The housing fraud was industrial - scale .
The economic shortsightedness bordered on lunacy .
End of the dream
Lehigh Acres , a sprawling bundle of communities without any kind of municipal government , is the worst .
You enter it along Gunnery Road , running east of Fort Myers , and pretty soon the dilapidation flows everywhere .
Particularly striking is the newness of it all .
Some of these homes — pastel orange , blue or green — have never been occupied , yet the windows are smashed , the appliances have been ripped out and the yards are a tangle of garbage - strewn brambles .
Foreclosed house in Fort Myers . ( Alan Habbick / CBC )
Many of the residents now are renters , attracted from even tougher areas , living alongside despairing homeowners who thought they 'd bought a piece of what some still insist on calling the American Dream .
Four years ago , Lehigh Acres homes were selling as fast as they were built and speculators and developers threw them up cheap and quickly .
Back then , anybody who could fog a mirror could get a mortgage .
Housing prices swelled every week .
Many of the mortgages were predatory , even fraudulent ; buyers were encouraged to lie about their incomes , and many did .
By December 2005 , when the housing market began to collapse , the median sales price of a home in the Fort Myers area was $ 322,000 .
Today it is $ 99,000 .
In Lehigh Acres , it is more like $ 50,000 .
Marc Joseph will gladly sell you one .
Foreclosures are us
" The beauty of these prices is that people are here taking advantage of the glass being half full , " says Joseph , with the relentless optimism of a realtor .
" Some people lost .
For other people , they gain . "
Trim and energetic , Joseph is prospering .
He runs Foreclosure Tours R Us , a company that does just what its name implies .
His green bus , blaring the company 's logo , hauls around groups of bargain - hunters responsible for the sudden upsurge in real estate sales .
In upscale neighbourhoods , people just glare at the bus and retreat inside their homes .
On more distressed streets , he 's just ignored .
" This is the time to pull the trigger , " he tells his clients .
" If the market has not reached bottom , it is very close to bottom .
Things are turning around . "
Perhaps .
That remains to be seen .
South Florida 's recent sales surge is more likely due to the sudden willingness of federally - supported banks to accept half , or even a third , of what a property was once worth .
These same banks account for nearly two - thirds of the sellers here .
In other words , the market is still deeply diseased , just shedding its more gangrenous flesh .
Up and left
Floridians , meanwhile , still have to live here , striving for normalcy as their society shrivels around them .
Cape Coral , more upscale than Lehigh Acres , lies on the other side of Fort Myers , surrounded by the clear water of the Gulf .
It 's the second biggest city in Florida by size , with more canals and water access than any city in America .
A vast , rambling place with no core and ghost towns on its edges .
I met a woman named Connie there , living in a bungalow .
She allowed herself to be coaxed out into the flat March sunlight on the promise that her family name would n't be used .
She 's embarrassed by the state of her neighbourhood and probably embarrassed by her own impending eviction .
The house next door is empty .
Foreclosed .
The one two doors down is empty , never occupied .
The family across the street abandoned their home a year ago .
Just packed up and left .
Connie thought they were going on vacation .
They even left their car , a late - model white Dodge Intrepid .
A notice on the driver 's window threatens it will be towed , at the owner 's expense , if it is n't moved in three days .
South Florida University professor Gary Mormino , creator of the notion of The Ponzi State .
( Alan Habbick / CBC )
" The city put that notice on nine months ago , " says Connie .
" I wish they 'd tow it .
I hate looking at it .
I hate it . "
She hates the overgrown yards , too .
They 're a fire hazard and they attract snakes .
The Ponzi state
Cape Coral can't afford to tow the car , though , or clear the brush from yards .
The loss of taxes from foreclosed properties is strangling its municipal government .
It 's the same story all over the state .
Not that there was ever much government to strangle .
Florida is light on government in general .
Governments cost money and Floridians do n't like paying taxes .
There is no state income tax here .
Gary Mormino , a professor at the University of South Florida , has compared the economy here to a giant Ponzi scheme , the confidence game in which investors are paid with the money of new investors .
The Ponzi State .
The phrase is catching on and it's making Mormino famous .
He says Florida 's economic setup has always depended on ever more people , often retirees on fixed incomes , arriving from out of state with money to spend .
Since 1970 , the state has grown by an average of 350,000 new residents a year — or a thousand a day .
To accommodate them , politicians in Tallahassee basically let developers build whatever they wanted just about anywhere they wanted .
Usually , that has meant apartment towers and minimally inspected cinder - block homes on concrete slabs .
The construction barely paused and neither did the waves of tourists — as many as 80 million vacationers a year , all ready to pay hotel taxes and rental taxes and restaurant taxes and sales taxes .
Now , everything 's flat .
In fact , more residents might be leaving than arriving .
And the tourists are staying away .
For Mormino , Florida is just a palm tree fantasy with a tax structure " that was insane . "
And now , he says , " we 're paralyzed . "
Unemployment is nightmarish and rising .
Tax - hating Floridians , turning to their government for help , are finding a stunted , business - driven entity with nothing to offer .
" When people began looking behind the palm trees and into the account books , " says Mormino , all they discovered was " massive fraud and lack of oversight . "
The ' rocket docket '
The disposal pipe for this dismal mess is the Lee County Courthouse in downtown Fort Myers .
Here , judges brought back from retirement preside over something called a " rocket docket , " expressly designed to push through thousands of foreclosures a month .
The homeowners who actually show up for this last hearing have no fight left .
Many are working - class minorities who were talked into believing you can own a house on minimum wage .
They seem to shrink when they stand to face the bench .
Judge Jack Schoonover is gentle with them .
If there are kids in the house he 'll usually allow 60 days .
But they will have to leave .
Schoonover wo n't tolerate poor paperwork by bank lawyers .
If they make a mistake , he kicks the case to the back of the line and tells the homeowner to go home for awhile longer .
But a hardship plea goes nowhere with him .
He tells one woman he can't find her a job .
" The president has to do that for you . "
Storm clouds in Florida as the housing skid pushes it to the top of the foreclosure heap .
( Alan Habbick / CBC )
By midday , he 's dealt with 190 cases , creating more product for the bottom - feeding investors who come in and buy in bulk .
At the Anna Maria oyster bar in Bradenton , waitress Carolyn Walker is keeping up a stream of cheery patter for the tables of retirees in plastic bibs .
Lobster is on special tonight .
" I'm an optimist , " she stresses , setting down my fried grouper .
But she does allow that tips are stingier these days .
Her life is getting tough .
She has a 12 - year - old daughter she hopes someday to send to college .
Lately , though , she 's been " literally living day to day . "
In middle age , she 's taken a second job cleaning people 's homes and that helps .
" My daddy , " she says , " raised me to be happy . "

Turley : Truth commission a ' shameful ' way to avoid prosecuting war crimes David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) called on Monday for a " truth and reconciliation commission " to investigate Bush administration abuses , describing it as a " middle ground ... to get to the bottom of what happened . "
However , constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley believes that would be a terrible idea .
" There 's no question that torture occurred here , " Turley told MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann .
" There 's no question that it was a war crime .
And so the only reason to have a commission of this kind is to avoid doing what we 're obligated to do under a treaty . "
" It is shameful that we would be calling for this type of commission , " Turley continued , calling it " incredible " that Leahy would be proposing an approach most associated with emerging democracies that lack a well - developed legal system .
" We 're obligated to investigate , " he insisted .
" This whole discussion in front of the whole world is basically saying that we are not going to comply with the promise we made , not to ourselves , but to the world . "
Olbermann noted that since the Bush administration itself claims that its actions were somehow above the law , " Does not using a special forum inherently validate the Bush claim that the regular rules did not apply to his presidency ? "
" It absolutely does , " Turley replied .
" There is great love for President Obama , and I have great respect for him , but you cannot say that no one is above the law and block the investigation of the war crimes by your predecessor .
It is a position without principle . "
" At the end of the day , " continued Turley , " no one believes that people will be prosecuted for a known war crime -- and when we do that then we will become accessories .
Those crimes of President Bush will become our crimes .
His shame will become our collective shame . "
" The Democrats are going to have to decide whether they want to detach themselves from principle , start their control of this government with an act of the most unprincipled sort , " Turley concluded .
" You have to decide whether you are a statesman or just one more politician looking for the next election . "

Here is what my George Mason University colleague Professor Richard Wagner wrote , which was published by Office of the House Republican Leader : " Any so - called stimulus program is a ruse .
The government can increase its spending only by reducing private spending equivalently .
Whether government finances its added spending by increasing taxes , by borrowing , or by inflating the currency , the added spending will be offset by reduced private spending .
Furthermore , private spending is generally more efficient than the government spending that would replace it because people act more carefully when they spend their own money than when they spend other people 's money . "
A short translation of Wagner 's comment is : There is no Santa Claus or Tooth Fairy .
Let 's examine the ruse .
Suppose the value of all that we will produce in 2009 , our gross domestic product ( GDP ) , totals $ 14 trillion .
There can not be any disagreement that if Congress spends $ 4 trillion , of necessity there is only $ 10 trillion left over for us to spend privately .
In other words , if Congress is going to spend $ 4 trillion , it must find a way to get us to spend $ 4 trillion less .
The most open and aboveboard method to force us to spend less privately is to tax us to the tune of $ 4 trillion .
You might say , " Congress does n't have to tax us $ 4 trillion .
They could tax us $ 3 trillion and run a $ 1 trillion budget deficit . "
You have that wrong .
There is no way for Congress to spend $ 4 trillion out of our 2009 $ 14 trillion GDP by getting us to spend only $ 3 trillion less privately .
It has to be $ 4 trillion less .
Another method to force us to spend less privately is to print money and inflate the currency .
Rising prices reduce our ability to spend privately since each dollar we hold will not buy as much .
Another way is for Congress to borrow , thereby reducing our ability to spend privately .
By the way , all of this means that in any real economic sense the federal budget is always balanced .
That is , if Congress spends $ 4 trillion we must privately spend $ 4 trillion less whether it is accomplished through taxation , inflation or borrowing .
The stimulus package being discussed is politically smart but economically stupid .
It 's that bedeviling , omnipresent Santa Claus and Tooth Fairy problem again .
Let 's say that Congress taxes you $ 500 to put toward creating construction jobs building our infrastructure .
The beneficiaries will be quite visible , namely men employed building a road .
The victims of Congress are invisible and are only revealed by asking what you would have done with the $ 500 if it were not taxed away from you .
Whatever you would have spent it on would have contributed to someone 's employment .
That person is invisible .
Politicians love it when the victims of their policies are invisible and the beneficiaries visible .
Why ?
Because the beneficiaries know for whom to vote and the victims do not know who is to blame for their plight .
In stimulus package language , if Congress taxes to hand out money , one person is stimulated at the expense of another , who pays the tax , who is unstimulated .
A visual representation of the stimulus package is : Imagine you see a person at work taking buckets of water from the deep end of a swimming pool and dumping them into the shallow end in an attempt to make it deeper .
You would deem him stupid .
That scenario is equivalent to what Congress and the new president proposes for the economy .
A far more important measure that Congress can take toward a healthy economy is to ensure that the 2003 tax cuts do n't expire in 2010 as scheduled .
If not , there are 15 separate taxes scheduled to rise in 2010 , costing Americans $ 200 billion a year in increased taxes .
In the face of a recession , we do n't need that .

If the BBC is to be believed , IDF soldiers are deliberately shooting women and children in Gaza .
Their TV reporting from the scene today interviewed doctors in hospitals who asked the obvious rhetorical question as to why they have children patients with multiple small arms wounds .
One child had two bullets in the head .
In the head , in the head , not fragments from large caliber weapons .
These were small arms bullets .
Israeli government spokesmen and demonstraters in New York are still " going on " about the peculiarly humane Israeli way of making war .
The protestations are wearing thin .
B'tselim , the Israeli human rights conscience is seeking to know whether or not these accusations of inhumanity are correct .
I , for one , will accept their judgment .
I have been in savage combats , and have had a hand in many more but the deliberate killing of children and women is something I have rarely seen .
I have seen the VC kill Montagnard women and kids .
That was the product of racial hatred on the part of the Vietnamese for these " Moi . "
That was a personal exception for me .
Generally , fighters will walk away from the dead bodies of male adult enemies and leave the women and children to grieve and starve .
If this is different , the Israeli people need to know and to put a stop to it .

I ’m often asked by people who like to prey on others how to buy real estate in a falling market , like this one .
The danger of doing so is that you buy before the bottom arrives , and take a capital gains hit .
The advantage is you hold absolutely all the cards , and can strike a great deal while the victim - seller is writhing in pain and begging for mercy .
That ’s the fun part .
So , do n’t ask me if it ’s time to buy yet , because you wo n’t like the answer .
But if you want some tips on being a vulture , for when the moment ’s right , then clip this and stick it on the fridge .
( By the way , this is another preview of my coming book . )
* Offer what you want to pay , not what the vendor is asking to be paid .
With so many properties listed , and so little sales activity , every offer has to be taken seriously .
Only by writing up an offer on your own terms , at your own price , will you get a sign - back showing the true level of desperation youâ€ ™re dealing with .
* Always submit the offer with a deposit cheque , which is like putting a shiny lure on the end of your fishing line .
However , the offer must stipulate the cheque is not cashable until a firm and binding agreement is reached .
So , it means nothing , while having a powerful psychological impact .
* Throw in as many conditions as you want .
This will create an offer that is completely tailored to your needs and wants while providing elements you can remove in order to gain things you truly want .
So , for example , make the offer conditional on the vendors paying all your closing costs , including land transfer tax .
While you never expect that to happen , you can remove it during negotiations in order to get what you do want and expect , which is a bargain price .
* Ditto for conditions giving you time to arrange financing or even to sell another property â€ “ they are both traditional deal - breakers , and the vendorâ€™s agent will know that immediately .
So , by reluctantly removing them you move far closer to getting that price .
* Best , however , to insist on a home inspection .
This condition should give you five business days to complete the process , and is normally done at the purchaserâ€™s expense .
The reason you want this is because almost all properties need some kind of work done in order to make them perfect , and when you get the inspectorâ€™s report you have leverage to help you drive down the price .
Simply get an estimate of the cost of the repairs and ask for the deal to be rewritten with a price reduced by that amount .
Since the vendor knows the condition is entirely for your benefit and the deal will die unless you sign a waiver , well , guess what ?
Vulture .
* And remember that the closing date is also an important poker chip to play .
Have your agent find out what the vendor wants , and then use that to help leverage the price down .
Additionally , you can throw any assets you see around the property into your offer â€ “ power tools , appliances , lawn tractor , Harley - Davidson , whatever .
The more you put in , the more clutter there is for the vendor to wade through , and the better chance you have of securing the best deal .
* Speaking of which , why not make two offers at the same time on two competing properties , and then let that fact be known ( through your agent ) to the vendor ?
That will add even more pressure to the poor guy , as he tries to figure out what he must do to save the deal , and give you what you want .
This may be cruel and unusual , but just consider it payback for all those multiple - offer situations greedy vendors placed buyers in during the bubble years .
* And , of course , you can make a low - ball offer , get a sign - back , and then just let it die .
Wait a week and go back in with another one , for the same low price .
Odds are you will not get the same response this time .
The stressed - out vendor may hate you , but heâ€™ll close .
London 's streets were dangerous places for innocent young men in uniform to judge from the world 's oldest sex education film , which has just been revived for posterity by the British Film Institute .
Filmed during the First World War , the silent footage features a young Canadian soldier called Dick – a name that seemingly had no unfortunate connotations back then – who is on leave in London where nicely dressed young women approach him , one after another .
Dick , the caption says , is " tempted " , but luckily , as he is about to meet his doom , a Canadian officer taps him on the arm .
" Do you realise , young man , the risks you run in association with that woman ? " he asks , silently .
Cut away to a seedy hotel room where another Canadian soldier has not been so well advised .
Though he and the fallen woman he has met are fully dressed , a ruffled bed is evidence of the risk to which he has exposed himself .
While his back is turned , the shameless woman goes through his wallet and stuffs a wedge of notes into her bra .
Back to Dick , now on a guided tour of a hospital ward where men are being treated for venereal disease , where he is shown horribly swollen legs and claw - like hands .
" Rotted legs and hands " , the caption reads .
The message is very clear : there is no such thing as safe sex for a soldier overseas so , laddie , keep your mind on your pure young girlfriend at home and say no .

The Canadian film , Whatsoever a Man Soweth , is the oldest of 16 classic sex lectures on celluloid that the BFI has put together on a two - DVD set , documenting more than half a century of the advice , warnings and euphemisms used to ward off disgrace among the young .
Fast forward 56 years , to 1973 and ' Ave You Got a Male Assistant Please Miss ? , and the film - makers seem relaxed about the idea of a man and a woman together in the sack .
However , just as the couple are about to get down to business , a disembodied voice says : " Hold it , hold it a minute .
Did you know that in 1969 there were 10,000 illegal abortions ? "
They did not , but the man – who incidentally has hair down to his shoulder blades – gets the message , whips on his trousers and set off at a run to find a chemist , where he is served by a male with even more hair .
Over the decades , evidently , the emphasis has switched to avoiding accidental pregnancy .
" There is no need to make an abortion of it , " is the final caption .
But even in the relative enlightenment of the early 1970s , casual sex was a cause for condemnation , for young women if not for young men .
This point is emphasised by the 1973 film Do n't be Like Brenda , Brenda being a foolish young woman who ends up pregnant , shunned by everyone around her , waiting in vain for the phone call from her ex-lover that never comes .
Not all the contributions are so grim .
The 1932 production The Mystery of Marriage , which bills itself as a " frank " explanation of sexual attraction , is a joyous romp through the marital arrangements of plants , insects , birds , mammals , and humans .
It tells you that butterflies are " frivolous " parents , but that most birds are good parents .
There is a vague hint that there is something these couples do that produces children which , when humans do it too , seems to involve a walk in the fresh air , a kiss near a haystack , followed by a meeting with an estate agent at which she says : " Then the lino will be laid free ? "
And her husband says : " And I only have to pay £ 10 ? "
That was as explicit as a film could be , in our grandparents ' day .
Katy McGahan , who produced the collection The Joy of Sex Education for the BFI , said : " The films document the various approaches educators have taken in disseminating important information about sex to the populace across 60 years .
" Today , with teenage pregnancy rates and reported cases of sexually - transmitted disease soaring , sex education remains high on the political agenda .
While most people accept that formal sex education is necessary , the question over who should teach it , how it should be taught , what information it should impart and what moral and social values it should inform remains ever contentious . "
If there 's one thing that still grates our nerves , it 's automated calling systems .
Or , more specifically , the robotic beings that simply fail to understand our slang and incomprehensible rants .
IBM ' s working hard and fast to change all that , with a team at the company 's Thomas J Watson research division developing and patenting a computerized voice that can utter " um , " " er " and " yes , we 're dead serious . "
The sophisticated system adds in the minutiae that makes conversation believable to Earthlings , and it 's even programmed to learn new nuances and react to phrases such as " shh . "
The technology has been difficulty coined " generating paralinguistic phenomena via markup in text - to - speech syntheses , " and while exact end uses have yet to be discussed publicly , we can certainly imagine a brave new world of automated CSRs .

The driver had to wait 9 minutes while she bought the bouquet .
What was the fare ?
$ 20 $ 120.20 $ 92.80 $ 91 $ 90
Answers & Explanations
1. E
The stock first increased by 10 % , that is , by $ 10 ( 10 % of $ 100 ) to $ 110 per share .
Then , the price decreased by $ 11 ( 10 % of $ 110 ) so that the sale price was $ 110 - $ 11 = $ 99 per share , and the sale price for 50 shares was 99 x $ 50 = $ 4950 .
2. C
She has been working at the rate of 10 papers per hour .
She has 30 papers remaining and must grade them in the 2.5 hours that she has left , which corresponds to a rate of 12 papers per hour .
of her previous rate , or 20 % faster .
3. B
The radius , R , of the satellite ’s orbit is the sum of the Earth ’s radius plus the satellite ’s orbital altitude , or R = 4400 miles .
The circumference of the circular orbit is therefore C = 2 π = 2π( 4400 ) = 8800 π miles .
Since 40 minutes is one third of the satellite ’s 120 - minute orbital time , it traverses one third of this distance in that time .
So the distance , D = 2 π × 4400 = 9210.66 miles , using 3.14 for π .
4. C
Prime numbers are those that are only evenly divisible by one and themselves .
5. C
There are 12 inches in a foot and 3 feet in a yard .
Four and a half yards is equal to 162 inches .
To determine the number of 3 - inche segments , divide 162 by 3 .
6 . A
If it takes 3 people 3 1/3 days to do the job , then it would take one person 10 days :
7. C
16.5 x 4/3 = 22 .
8. B
25 % off is equivalent to 25 × $ 138 / 100 = $ 34.50 , so the sale price becomes $ 138 – $ 34.50 = $ 103.50 .
A. $ 67 ≠ $ 103.50
C. $ 34.50 is the amount of the reduction , not the final price .
D. $ 113 ≠ $ 103.50
E. $ 125 ≠ 103.50
9 . B
30 % 0 f 3300 = 0.3 x 3300 = 990
A. 330 is of 3300 , not 30 %
C. 700 is of 3300 , not 30 %
D. 1100 is of 3300 , not 30 %
E. 2310 is of 3300 , not 30 %
10 . C
The total distance traveled was 8 + 3.6 = 11.6 miles .
The first 1/5th of a mile is charged at the higher rate .
Since 1/5th = 0.2 , the remainder of the trip is 11.4 miles .
Thus the fare for the distance traveled is computed as $ 5.50 + 5 × 11.4 × $ 1.50 = $ 91 .
To this the charge for waiting time must be added , which is simply 9 x 20 cents = 180 cents = $ 1.80 .
Finally , add the two charges , $ 91 + $ 1.80 = $ 92.80 .
Since this value is unique , all other answers are incorrect .

If you have an extra 7.8 millions and want that kind of exclusivity do n’t wait any longer .
Paying for replacement windows in this car would probably cost as much as buying a used and fairly inexpensive car .
A one - off custom - built Maybach was unveiled in May 2005 at the Tempodrom in Berlin .
Commissioned by tire company Fulda , the Exelero is a chopped - down two - seater coupe , though it ’s more than just a show car – in tests at the Nardo high - speed oval , the prototype reached a speed of 218.38 mph , despite weighing over 2.66 tones .
It is capable of acceleration from 0 - 60 mph in 4.4 seconds .
The car ’s design was the result of a competition amongst students at the Pforzheim Polytechnic Department of Transport Design , which has worked on show vehicles for Fulda in the past .
The design of 24 - year - old Fredrik Burchhardt was chosen , and his work was coordinated with that of the Maybach design centre in Sindelfingen .
The project , based on the Maybach 57 limousine , required a certain amount of re-engineering ; the A - pillar and doors had to be shifted rearwards , and the steering column , pedals and gearshift all re-located .
The standard 550 bhp V12 engine was bored out to 5.9 liters , and tuned for 700 bhp and over 738 lb ft of torque .
With final dimensions of 5890 mm long , 2140 mm wide and just 1390 mm high , the car was kitted out with a full - spec interior , including leather , neoprene , aluminum and carbonfibre finishes .
Maybach says the car , built by Stola in Turin , is “ a one - off vehicle created to showcase the new ultra - high performance Exelero tire range from leading tire manufacturer Fulda ” ; it ’s not the first time the two companies have teamed up , as back in 1938 Fulda demonstrated its tires on a Maybach SW 38 limousine .
There are , however , “ no plans to produce the model in series ” , though it has been certified for on - road use .

Remember yesterday ... when everything was awesome and hopeful ?
Well , with this morning 's coffee came the cold hard truth once more : the economy is seriously stinking up the joint , and it only seems to be getting worse .
Logitech 's announced their third - quarter earnings ( down 70 percent ) and simultaneously said it 's going to shrug off 600 of its employees , while the folks over at Intel have said they 're shutting down a manufacturing facility in the Philippines which houses 1,800 employees .
Sony 's vaguely announced a " restructuring " which is bound to result in misery and job loss , while Sega confirmed that " about 30 " people have been vaporized from the pay sheet .
So ... everything 's cool with this blogging job , right guys ?
Guys !?
Read - Confirmed : Sega cuts staff Read - Sony announces restructuring plan Read - Intel announces RP operation shutdown Read - Logitech third quarter profits fell 70 percent
Apple has announced the top apps downloaded for 2008 .
The list is fairly long , but the top is mainly filled with games and social apps .
Unsurprisingly , Facebook , AIM , Google Earth , Enigmo and Super Monkey Ball are among the top of the list .
The page listing the top apps in iTunes consists of 120 different applications and are broken down into top games , utilities etc .
With the NDA lifted and experience in development growing , we should see some great apps in 2009 .

Those crazy folks on Madison Avenue had a difficult task getting this year ’s Super Bowl ads ready .
At $ 3 million per 30 - second spot , these commercials have to deliver humor and entertainment and pitch the product in some shape or form to consumer concerns .
Unfortunately for advertisers , this meant trying to address the recession worries that seem to overshadow pretty much everything else nowadays .
Recession = downer = not funny .
So how did advertisers pull off funny commercials while tackling the recession ?
Let ’s just say some did better than others .
Workplace anxiety
Slapstick has been a huge favorite of advertisers lately .
In this spot , however , the slapstick goes to the side of frightening .
Employees throw a heavy snow globe through a glass vending machine window and then at a fellow employee .
Given all the stress that ’s will be building in America ’s offices over the next few months , this ad is just not that funny .
Today it ’s snowglobes , tomorrow it ’s an AK - 47 .
Power Fantasies
Some advertisers obviously figured that , in a time when people feel helpless , the best commercial should fulfill that need for control .
So they created this piece about a creepy guy who uses an omnipotent bag of Doritos to fulfill his criminal desires .
See also the GoDaddy.com pervert spot ( not shown here ) .
Inspiration
For decades , Budweiser has relied on the Clydesdale to awe consumers into buying a six - pack .
So , does the Clydesdale featured in multiple ads last night have the clout to lift viewers out of their economic blues ?
Probably not .
But , lucky for Bud , alcohol does .
Assurances
I think Hyundai was trying to shoot straight with this one .
But , to me , promising people that they can bring their car back if they lose their job only underscores how precarious our situation really is .
Result : good feeling gone ; bad feeling still here .
Avoidance
Momma always said , “ If you ca n’t say anything nice , do n’t say anything at all . ”
Some advertisers listen to Momma evidently .
Ads from Toyota , Audi , and Pepsi stayed far away from any sign of the office , taxes , or money problems .
Were these ads worth $ 3 million plus ?

Black people stand for election forthcoming Basra polls
guardian.co.uk
In Iraq 's deep south another American - led revolution is stirring .
But this time it is being sparked by popular voice , not bombs .
The country 's 1 m - plus black citizens have tapped into Obama - mania like few other groups across the Arab world .
For them Obama 's inauguration was the dawn of a civil rights movement that they never had the impetus to strive for .
Black Iraqis will this week stand for the first time as an electoral bloc in provincial polls that will help shape Iraq in its slow transition to full sovereignty and possibly help shake off the stereotype that places them near the top of the heap in a nation of persecuted minorities .
Like the marsh Arabs to the north of their relative stronghold in Basra , black Iraqis are an underclass who find it near impossible to rise above their time - worn status of hard - labourers and peasants .
Up to 50 % of black Iraqis migrated to the Arabian Peninsula after the birth of Islam 1,500 years ago .
The rest have come steadily in the centuries since , some trafficked as slaves and others lured by broken promises of riches .
All have been typecast , " just as the blacks of America were " , said Jalal Dhiyab , number two on the electoral list of the Secretary of the Free Movement of Iraqis .
" We joined this election because we felt we could break the wall surrounding Iraqi society and the climate of fear we have felt for generations , " he said .
" Black people have been treated very poorly throughout Iraqi history .
The oppression has stopped us from joining many levels of society .
It has restricted our education .
We have become a social underclass .
We are taking part in the new elections to give black Iraqis a new purpose in Iraq . "
Obama 's victory was a milestone in the history of democracy throughout the world , said Dhiyab .
" It is a victory for freedom .
He has experienced suffering and seen serious challenges in his life .
And yet he has reached the White House where decisions are made that affect all the people in the world .
We hope that Obama 's policy in Iraq differs from Bush 's policy here .
The Bush regime destroyed lives and infrastructure and fractured the whole of Iraqi society . "
The Free Movement of Iraqis is putting forward eight candidates in the provincial poll , in which 1,272 candidates are standing for 35 seats in the Basra province .
Around 30 % of the nominated candidates are women .
The polls will be held on 31 January , ahead of national elections later in the year .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The founder of an upstate New York TV station aimed at countering Muslim stereotypes has been arrested on suspicion of killing his wife , who was beheaded , authorities said .
Muzzammil Hassan has been charged with murder in the death of his wife , Aasiya Hassan .
Muzzammil Hassan was charged with second - degree murder after police found the decapitated body of his wife , Aasiya Hassan , at the Bridges TV station in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park , said Andrew Benz , Orchard Park 's police chief .
Hassan was arrested Thursday .
His wife filed for divorce February 6 , and police had responded to several domestic violence calls at the couple 's home , Benz said .
On Monday , Benz told CNN that Hassan went directly to the police station after his wife 's death Thursday and confessed to killing her .
However , Benz on Tuesday denied that he 'd said Hassan confessed .
Hassan told Orchard Park police his wife was dead , led officers to her body and was arrested Thursday , Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita III told CNN on Tuesday .
Hassan is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday .
Attempts to reach an attorney for Hassan were unsuccessful Monday , and his family did n't return calls from CNN .
He had two children , 4 and 6 , with his wife .
He had two other children , 17 and 18 , from his previous marriage .
He launched Bridges TV , billed as the first English - language cable channel targeting Muslims inside the United States , in 2004 .
At the time , Hassan said he hoped the network would balance negative portrayals of Muslims following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The station 's staff is " deeply shocked and saddened by the murder of Aasiya Hassan and the subsequent arrest of Muzzammil Hassan , " a statement from Bridges TV said .
" Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to the families of the victim , " the statement said .

If , like me , you are a fan of first - person computer games and space exploration , you may be more than a little excited to hear about this news .
A group of companies are currently working with NASA to create a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game ( MMORPG ) based around the space agency ’s endeavours .
They will use a game engine more familiar driving first - person shooters than online roleplay adventures ; the tried and tested Unreal Engine 3 technology .
The Internet has a growing number of vast space - based MMORPGs , but NASA is hoping to use one of the most advanced gaming engines to develop an engrossing first - person online adventure , where players can choose their own mission to explore space , interact with other players and build settlements on other worlds .
All this will take place in a scientifically accurate vision of a near - future Universe in 2035 …
“ Players will pick a profession like a roboticist , space geologist , astrobiologist or mechanical engineer and work together as a team as they explore space and complete missions , establishing bases and outposts and traveling to the farthest reaches of the solar system , ” explained Jerry Heneghan , founder and CEO of Virtual Heroes , one of the companies involved with developing the NASA MMORPG Astronaut : Moon , Mars and Beyond .
“ The game will offer both individual challenges and team - based objectives to encourage players to use real - life applications of science , math and engineering to unlock new in - game vehicles , spacesuits , robotics and mining apparatus that will propel them further into space . ”
MMORPGs are increasingly popular gaming platforms , where players can participate in seemingly boundless virtual universes .
Popular examples of MMORPGs are World of Warcraft ( which dominates with a monthly subscriber base of 11.5 million people ) , Second Life , EverQuest and space - based rollplayer games such as EVE Online and Star Trek Online .
Now NASA is hoping to create a very popular online gaming / educational experience that will not only entertain , but get young people interested in a career in science and engineering .
What ’s more , it is hoped the game will incorporate the Unreal Engine 3 Editor so that players can design their own content , from spaceships and stations to mission profiles .
The developers will also include scenarios , such as the threat of near - Earth asteroid impacts and other reality - based events as the online community develops .
This will provide a problem - solving / adventure element , while keeping the science grounded in science fact .
See more screenshots from the game »
There are concerns that a NASA space reality platform may not be very popular , as other in - space universes offer space fantasy , with epic spaceship battles and alien encounters .
Also , the technical detail in carrying out “ mundane ” astronaut tasks may be a turn - off ; virtual universes depend on exploration rather than educational tasks .
Hopefully NASA and MMORPG developers will strike a healthy balance between education and entertainment .
However , I ’m very excited to see Astronaut appear online sometime next year .

The federal government on Friday placed beluga whales that live in Cook Inlet in Alaska on the endangered species list , rejecting efforts by Gov. Sarah Palin and others against increased protection .
The relatively small , whitish whales , sometimes visible from downtown Anchorage , declined by almost 50 percent in the late 1990s , and federal scientists say they have not rebounded despite a series of protections , including a halt to subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives .
About 375 whales have been counted in Cook Inlet each of the last two years , according to scientists with the National Marine Fisheries Service .
“ In spite of protections already in place , Cook Inlet beluga whales are not recovering , ” James W. Balsiger , the acting assistant administrator for the fisheries agency , said in a written statement .
The whales are in danger of extinction , Dr. Balsiger said .
The announcement , made on a predetermined schedule under the Endangered Species Act , drew further attention to Ms. Palin ’s positions on environmental issues .
The governor , the Republican nominee for vice president , has come under scrutiny for her ambiguous statements about climate change and her administration ’s failed effort earlier this year to prevent another species , the polar bear , from being listed as threatened .
The state is suing the federal government over the polar bear listing .

How many different sudokus are there ?
How many different ways are there to color in the countries on a map ?
And how do atoms behave in a solid ?
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self - Organization in Göttingen and at Cornell University ( Ithaca , USA ) have now developed a new method that quickly provides an answer to these questions .
In principle , there has always been a way to solve them .
However , computers were unable to find the solution as the calculations took too long .
With the new method , the scientists look at separate sections of the problem and work through them one at a time .
Up to now , each stage of the calculation has involved the whole map or the whole sudoku .
The answers to many problems in physics , mathematics and computer science can be provided in this way for the first time .
( New Journal of Physics , February 4 , 2009 )
Whether sudoku , a map of Germany or solid bodies - in all of these cases , it ’s all about counting possibilities .
In the sudoku , it is the permitted solutions ; in the solid body , it is the possible arrangements of atoms .
In the map , the question is how many ways the map can be colored so that adjacent countries are always shown in a different color .
Scientists depict these counting problems as a network of lines and nodes .
Consequently , they need to answer just one question :
How many different ways are there to color in the nodes with a certain number of colors ?
The only condition : nodes joined by a line may not have the same color .
Depending on the application , the color of a node is given a completely new significance .
In the case of the map , " color " actually means color ; with sudoku the " colors " represent different figures .
Two of 1152 different ways to color the nodes of the same lattice .
Nodes connected by a line may not have the same color .

" The existing algorithm copies the whole network for each stage of the calculation and only changes one aspect of it each time , " explains Frank van Bussel of the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self - Organization ( MPIDS ) .
Increasing the number of nodes dramatically increases the calculation time .
For a square lattice the size of a chess board , this is estimated to be many billions of years .
The new algorithm developed by the Göttingen - based scientists is significantly faster .
" Our calculation for the chess board lattice only takes seven seconds , " explains Denny Fliegner from MPIDS .
This is how it ’s done :
With the new method , the researchers move through the network node by node .
As if the computer program were short - sighted , it only ever looks at the next node point and not at the whole network .
At the first node point , it cannot finalize the color selection as it would have to know how all the other nodes are connected to each other .
However , instead of answering this question , the program notes down a formula for the first lattice point which contains this uncertainty as an unknown quantity .
As it progresses through the network , all the connections become visible and the unknown quantities are eliminated .
Having arrived at the final node point , the program ’s knowledge of the network is complete .
This new method can be used on much more complicated cases than the existing standard algorithm .
" We can now answer many questions in physics , graph theory and computer science that have hitherto been practically unsolvable , " says Marc Timme from MPIDS .
" For example , our method can be applied to antiferromagnetic solids , " he adds .
In these solid bodies , every atom has an internal rotational pulse , called spin , which can have different values .
Usually , adjacent atoms exhibit different spins .
It is now possible to calculate the number of possible spin arrangements , which will allow physicists to draw conclusions about the fundamental characteristics of the thermodynamics of solid bodies .

Maybe you eat a fairly healthy diet most of the time , so you might assume indulging in two or more cans of your favorite soda pop every day can't be too bad for you .
But , especially if you are a woman , you could be setting yourself up for kidney disease .
Researchers from Loyola University Health System say they 've found out that women who drink at least two cans of soda pop a day are nearly twice as likely to show early signs of kidney disease as those who do n't drink that many sodas .
For the study just published in , a peer - reviewed journal of science and medical research produced by the Public Library of Science , Loyola scientists examined data from a representative sample of 9,358 U.S. adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) .
The NHANES participants gave urine samples and also filled out questionnaires about their dietary habits .
Women who said they drank two or more sodas in the 24 hours before the urine test were 1.86 times more likely to have albuminuria , an excess amount of a protein called albumin , in their urine .
This was a warning flag to the researchers because healthy kidneys should filter out large molecules like albumin .
That means an excess amount of albumin can be a sign of early kidney damage .
So what causes this link between fizzy sweet drinks and kidney damage ?
In a statement to the media , David Shoham , assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology at Loyola , said that additional studies are needed to find out .
But there are some clues .
" People are consuming too much sugar .
The problem with high fructose corn syrup ( in soda pop ) is that it contributes to over consumption .
It 's cheap , it has a long shelf life and it allows you to buy a case of soda for less than $ 10 , " stated Shoham , who headed the research team .
What 's more , there could be something in the high fructose corn syrup that 's particularly damaging to women 's kidneys .
A study by other scientists , recently published in the journal , found that nine of 20 commercial samples of high fructose corn syrup from three manufacturers were contaminated with measurable levels of mercury .
" This adds the intriguing possibility that it is not just the sugar itself in high fructose corn syrup that is harmful , because mercury is harmful to kidneys as well , " Shoham noted in the media statement .
Chronic kidney disease is a major health problem in the U.S. According to the National Kidney Foundation , approximately 26 million American adults have chronic kidney disease .
When the disease is advanced , it causes symptoms such as fatigue , poor appetite , trouble sleeping , inability to concentrate and swollen feet .

My personal excitement for Sony 's God of War III can't be understated .
Let it be known that the font size that I 'd like to use to type out the letters " O , " " M , " " F , " and " G " would be too large to fit on any known computer monitor .
So this week is exciting for me for a few reasons .
One , Game Informer has revealed that the cover story for their March issue is none other than God of War III .
The magazine 's Web site teases the 10 - paged story by showing off the cover , which depicts our boy Kratos ripping into a cyclops with his bloodied blades .
But Game Informer is n't the only one getting a look at the reason why I bought a PlayStation 3 .
The good news : tomorrow I will be in Los Angeles getting a sneak peak of God of War III for Destructoid , gathering info and screenshots to bring back to you guys .
The bad news is you 'll have to wait until Friday , February 13 at 9:00 am Pacific time to get your God of War III fix .
Your calendars .
Mark them .
House File 183 , introduced in the Iowa House of Representatives on February 3 , 2009 , and referred to the House Education Committee , is the latest antievolution " academic freedom " bill .
Entitled the " Evolution Academic Freedom Act , " HF 183 contains three sections .
In the first , it is contended that " current law does not expressly protect the right of instructors to objectively present scientific information relevant to the full range of scientific views regarding chemical and biological evolution , " that " instructors have experienced or feared discipline , discrimination , or other adverse consequences as a result of presenting the full range of scientific views regarding chemical and biological evolution , " and that " existing law does not expressly protect students from discrimination due to their positions or views regarding biological or chemical evolution . "
The following sections of the bill provide that teachers in the state 's public schools and instructors in the state 's public community colleges and state universities may " objectively present scientific information relevant to the full range of scientific views regarding biological and chemical evolution in connection with teaching any prescribed curriculum regarding chemical or biological evolution " and that they " shall not be disciplined , denied tenure , terminated , or otherwise discriminated against " for doing so .
Also , the bill adds , although students " shall be evaluated based upon their understanding of course materials through standard testing procedures , " they " shall not be penalized for subscribing to a particular position or view regarding biological or chemical evolution . "
Presumably attempting to avert a likely challenge to its constitutionality , HF 183 provides that it " shall not be construed to promote any religious doctrine , promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs , or promote discrimination for or against religion or nonreligion . "
The bill also attempts to avoid a likely charge of inappropriate legislative micromanagement of the curriculum by disclaiming any intention to " require or encourage any change in the core curriculum adopted by the state board of education ... the core content standards ... or the accreditation standards and curriculum definitions " or in " curricula on biological or chemical evolution adopted by the board of directors of a community college or the state board of regents . "
VIENNA — With an aggressive style that stood out in the staid world of Austrian banking even more than her bouffant red wig , Sonja Kohn made few friends gathering billions for Bernard L. Madoff from wealthy investors in Russia and across Europe .
Now , she has even fewer .
Mrs. Kohn has dropped out of sight , leaving the firm she founded , Bank Medici , in the hands of Austrian regulators , who took it over last week .
Embarrassment from investing heavily with Mr. Madoff could explain wanting to disappear from public view .
But another theory widely repeated by those who know Mrs.
Kohn is that she may be afraid of some particularly displeased investors : Russian oligarchs whose money made up a chunk of the $ 2.1 billion that Bank Medici invested with Mr. Madoff .
“ With Russian oligarchs as clients , ” said a Viennese banker who knew Mrs. Kohn and her husband socially , “ she might have reason to be afraid . ”
Editor 's note : David Smick , a global strategic adviser , is author of " The World Is Curved : Hidden Dangers to the Global Economy " ( Penguin Portfolio ) .
He is chief executive of Johnson Smick International , a financial market advisory firm based in Washington .
David Smick says the Obama adminstration 's executive pay curbs provide political cover for the next bank bailout .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
This week , the Obama administration launched an angry campaign ( and rightly so ) targeting the greed of the financial services industry .
The big bank executives -- with their French private aircraft purchases , Las Vegas boondoggles and multibillion - dollar bonuses ( despite having just received taxpayer bailout funding ) -- appear politically tone deaf .
Now the Treasury Department is proposing a $ 500,000 salary cap on senior executives of banks receiving taxpayer funding .
But here 's how Washington really works .
The reason for Obama 's public campaign is that soon officials are likely to hand the banks a taxpayer - funded bailout potentially worth trillions of dollars .
Therefore , what 's happening here is the creation of old - fashioned political cover .
The administration needs this cover because it faces a horrible choice .
At issue is how the Treasury arrives at a price for the banks ' toxic assets in any bailout package that entails taxpayer funding .
Here 's the catch :
If officials value the toxic assets at too low a price , all bank stocks will collapse .
The world then would declare the large U.S. banks insolvent .
America would face financial Armageddon .
On the other hand , valuing the toxic assets at an artificially high price ( at the taxpayers ' expense ) may save the banks but invites a political firestorm at a time when average folks are hurting .
Thus the need for cover .
Essentially , the administration is offering the bankers an implicit deal .
Even though senior executives from banks receiving government assistance will face limits on their salaries , the value of their personal shareholdings in their companies -- where for most executives the big money is -- could potentially be restored if bank stocks rise in response to the bailout .
In many cases , those shareholdings are now all but worthless paper .
President Obama is being forced to provide a bank bailout because of the banks ' dirty little secret :
Their off - balance - sheet financial exposure is far larger than publicly acknowledged -- according to various banking analysts , their liability to losses is from four to 16 times their stated on - balance - sheet exposure to bad assets .
Thus , a bailout , with those assets stuffed into a so - called " bad bank " owned by the taxpayer , could require potentially trillions of taxpayer dollars .
To lead us out of this morass successfully , Obama needs to more clearly lay out for the American people the horrific details of our global financial landscape .
He should begin with the myth that the financial crisis is just the result of a subprime mortgage bubble .
Actually , the crisis is the result of massive , worldwide financial de-leveraging that is also afflicting Europe , the UK , China and many other emerging market economies .
The world faces a multitude of financial bubbles .
These include credit card , emerging market and commercial real estate debt , along with widespread derivatives exposure including those notorious credit default swaps .
An even larger bubble could develop -- a bond market bubble -- as a result of other governments following America 's lead in implementing large fiscal stimulus packages .
That is because governments worldwide will soon be borrowing from the credit markets all at the same time .
In the end , it 's understandable that the Obama folks are politically nervous .
They have inherited a problem of historic proportion .
Because of the enormous size of the banks ' exposure , the administration should look at an alternative approach -- giving the banks government guarantees in return for taking the toxic assets off their balance sheets , instead of giving the banks more taxpayer money .
Sen . Charles Schumer , D - New York , already has suggested such an approach .
There are limits to the amount of debt the American taxpayer and financial system can shoulder .
Maybe our new president is wise to engage in some political taking - of - cover .
He would also be wise to avoid repeating the mistakes of the previous administration .
After all , it wo n't be long before Obama , through no fault of his own , will politically " own " the financial crisis .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Smick .
All About Barack Obama • Recessions and Depressions • Financial Markets
President - Elect Barack Obama will inherit a host of problems from outgoing President Bush .
From an economy in recession to the Iraq War , cleaning up from eight years of the worst US president is a immense task .
Obama has already selected many former rivals , such as Hilary Clinton , for his cabinet , but the most important appointee he will make is the head of the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
Although the EPA administrator is not a cabinet level position , this may change as Obama faces the crisis of climate change .
Under the Bush administration , the EPA has lost all credibility as an agency that protects Americans from air and water pollution .
According to the Washington Post ,
“ …over the past eight years , many career employees and rank - and - file scientists have clashed with Bush appointees over a number of those of issues , including whether the federal government should allow California to regulate tailpipe emissions from automobiles … ”
Obama has vowed to bring integrity back to the agency by reversing Bush ’s executive orders :
“ I think the slow chipping away against clean air and clean water has been deeply disturbing .
Much of it has n’t gone through Congress .
It was done by fiat .
That is something that can be changed by an administration , in part by reinvigorating the EPA , which has been demoralized . ”
The importance of who is selected to lead the EPA is so profound , Obama is considering elevating the position to cabinet - level status .
In fact , Gene Karpinski , president of the League of Conservation Voters , believes ,
“ The most important challenge facing the new administration is making serious progress on global warming pollution .
That includes specific steps such as regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant . ”
Who will Obama chose for this formidable task ?
The following is a shortlist of possible EPA candidates being discussed in the mainstream media :
Kathleen McGinty - Former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Head : McGinty served as a top environmental official under President Clinton , and she has promoted renewable energy legislation in Pennsylvania while working with utility companies .

Nichols is Senator Boxer ’s top pick for the job .

Robert F. Kennedy , Jr.-Environmental Lawyer : Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. is probably the most well - known candidate on the shortlist :
Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. ’s reputation as a resolute defender of the environment stems from a litany of successful legal actions .
Mr. Kennedy was named one of Time magazine ’s “ Heroes for the Planet ” for his success helping Riverkeeper lead the fight to restore the Hudson River .
According to Stop Global Warming , Lisa Jackson is the leading candidate to head Obama ’s EPA , but no matter who gets the job , the task of curbing the effects of climate change immediately is monumental .
Frank O’Donnell , president of Clean Air Watch , explained , “ During the last eight years , we have made precious little progress against air pollution and we ’ve missed some opportunities . ”
We ca n’t afford to miss any more opportunities .

' I was NOT warned about banks crisis ' : Brown denies he knew FSA had raised alarm about risk to HBOS
FSA warned HBOS in 2002 it was taking too many risks
Brown denies he or Treasury officials were ever told
He denies handpicking Sir James Crosby for FSA role
But Tories say the ' net is closing in ' on him and Darling
Bailout chief announces plans to step down
Gordon Brown today denied he was aware banks were being warned as early as 2002 that they were running out of control .
The Prime Minister - who was then the Chancellor - insisted he was never told of the Financial Services Authority 's concerns about risky practices at HBOS .
He also sought to distance himself from Sir James Crosby , the key Government adviser who stood down as deputy chairman of the FSA yesterday .
Mr Brown , in a grilling by senior MPs , denied he had hand - picked Sir James to be on the FSA board 2003 and said he was selected by an independent panel .
However , the Tories claimed the ' net is closing in ' on him and Alistair Darling over the banking crisis and that their argument they knew nothing has been shattered .
The Government 's handling of the economic crisis was in even more disarray as a key adviser announced his plans to step down .
Denial : Gordon Brown started off joking with the MPs but soon became angry when they were incredulous the Treasury was not told about fears for HBOS
American Glen Moreno was brought in to manage taxpayers ' multi-billion pound interests in High Street lenders .
But the chairman of UK Financial Investments Ltd was until last April a trustee of a secretive Liechtenstein - based fund at the centre of a row over tax evasion .
Mr Darling stressed his appointment was only temporary today - prompting a Tory taunt that the Government was ' about to lose its second key banking adviser ' .
The FSA last night revealed it had warned HBOS about its risk assessment back in 2002 , well before whistleblower Paul Moore told bosses of his own fears .
But Mr Brown told the Commons Liaison Committee this morning that ' no information ' was passed on to the Treasury because the discussions were considered routine .
' These were regarded as ordinary issues that were normally dealt with by the interaction between the FSA and HBOS , ' he said .
Despite his denials , critics are now focusing on the close relationship between Sir James and Mr Brown as they attack his handling of the economy .

It was under Mr Brown at the Treasury that the banker was elected to the board of the FSA in 2003 and he had been a key Government adviser for more than two years .
In 2007 , he became deputy chairman of the watchdog - a position he resigned yesterday following allegations he sacked Mr Moore after he warned of a looming crisis at the bank .
The row has dragged the Prime Minister to the heart of the controversy over banks ' behaviour and left Opposition MPs questioning his judgement .
Today , he insisted that he had not personally chosen Sir James to go onto the board of the FSA and that he had been picked by an independent panel .
The assessors had concluded he was a ' leading industry practitioner with broad experience ' and an ' outstanding individual with a strong intellect ' , he told MPs .
He said he believed the ' right decisions ' had been made but said that as chancellor at the time he ' took responsibility ' for what happened .
The Prime Minister also dismissed the idea HBOS had failed because Mr Moore 's warnings were not heeded and said ' its whole business model ' had been wrong .
The FSA had concluded there was no systemic risk at the bank so decided there was no need to inform the Government , he said .
But MPs were incredulous the tripartite authority made up of the FSA , Bank of England and Treasury officials was never made aware of the issue .
Close : Gordon Brown with Sir James Crosby back in 2001 .
The ex-HBOS boss was one of the Prime Minister 's key economic advisers
George Osborne declared Labour either knew exactly what was going on or was ' entirely ignorant ' , adding that neither was ' much of a defence ' .
The shadow chancellor told Mr Darling in the Commons : ' The net is closing in on the Prime Minister and you .
Their accomplices are resigning .
' Their alibi that nobody knew what was going on has been blown apart .
And their fingerprints are all over the mistakes that were made during the age of irresponsibility . '
On bonuses , Mr Brown insisted the ' short - term bonus culture of banks has got to end ' and specifically backed controversial ' claw back ' proposals .
This would see bankers who were rewarded having to pay money back if it later turned out they had not done a good job .
' It should not be a one - way bet , ' he told the committee .
' In other words , if you fail there is a clawback which is also possible within a bonus system . '
Out : Sir James at his home yesterday after he resigned as deputy chairman of the Financial Services Authority
The FSA first warned HBOS about its risk assessment in 2002 , it revealed in a shock statement last night after Sir James ' resignation .
The bank then made changes , including upgrading the post of senior risk manager to board level , the regulator said .
Mr Moore was sacked and replaced in 2004 .
By December that year , the situation had improved but the bank was still told it needed to increase the ability of its risk experts to influence the business .
Mr Moore subsequently claimed he had been sacked for questioning the approach of the bank and replaced with someone without risk experience .
Warnings :
The FSA says it warned HBOS it was taking too many risks considerably before ex-employee Paul Moore raised his concerns
The FSA said last night that it had taken his allegations seriously but backed the findings of an inquiry in 2005 which ruled they were unfounded .
However , in 2006 , it still had concerns about HBOS and warned its growth strategy ' posed risks to the whole group ' which ' needed to be managed and mitigated ' .
Today 's meeting was already going to be uncomfortable for Mr Brown , coming at a time when his handling of the financial meltdown is in disarray .
Labour has slumped in the opinion polls in recent weeks and now , with the row over Sir James , critics can link the Premier even closer to the banking crisis .
As he resigned yesterday , the former HBOS chief insisted that the claims made against him had ' no substance ' but that stepping down was ' the right course of action ' .
There was widespread speculation that Number Ten had forced his hand to limit Mr Brown 's embarrassment at Prime Minister 's Questions .
But Sir James said last night that his resignation was ' solely inspired by the desire not to make life more difficult for colleagues ... under relentless pressure at the FSA ' .
Mr Brown said he was ' right ' to have stood down and also revealed he was no longer working as an economic adviser to the Government .
The banker had become HBOS chief executive in 1999 .
In 2004 , he was appointed to the board of the FSA with Mr Brown 's approval .
After his departure from HBOS , he was appointed by Mr Brown , the then Chancellor , to produce a report supporting Labour plans for ID cards - and was knighted .
In 2007 , he became deputy chairman of the FSA and then in April 2008 , the Treasury turned to him again when they needed a report into the ailing mortgage market .
Budget delayed until April
The Government has announced this year 's Budget will be delivered on April 22 - more than a month later than usual .
Alistair Darling is expected to unveil yet more measures to offset the recession and financial crisis in the report .
He is also likely to revise his forecast that the economy will return to growth in the second half of 2009 .
The dormant legal case surrounding Roman Polanski has started up again .
A state appeals court in Los Angeles on Monday rejected Mr. Polanski ’s request that the Los Angeles County Superior Court be disqualified from deciding whether his prosecution be dismissed because of alleged wrongdoing in the justice system .
In the ruling , a division of the Second Appellate District Court said the Superior Court was free to consider the dismissal request .
Judge Peter Espinoza had planned a hearing on this matter for Jan. 21 , but the appeals court stopped it at the last minute .
Mr. Polanski fled the country more than 30 years ago after pleading guilty to having illegal sexual relations with a 13 - year - old girl .
In this survey of Jesus ’ apostles , we have come once more to the towering figure of Peter .
The early part of his biography is found in the four Gospels ( see the Vision series titled The Gospels for the 21st Century ) .
His middle years are accounted for in the book of Acts ( see the first three articles in the Apostles series ) .
But there are yet more aspects of his life and teaching to be gleaned from other New Testament books .
Before doing that , let ’s recap the essentials .
Jesus Himself gave Simon , a Galilean fisherman , the name by which he ’s best known .
He “ looked at him and said , ‘ So you are Simon the son of John ?
You shall be called Cephas ’ ( which means Peter ) ” ( John 1:42 ) .
These names , Aramaic and Greek respectively , both mean “ rock . ”
Peter is also referred to as Simon Bar - Jonah ( Matthew 16:17 ) and Simon or Simeon Peter ( John 1:40 ; 2 Peter 1:1 ) .
If Mark ’s Gospel was indeed the earliest written , as many scholars think , then we first meet Peter there .
Alternatively , the several references to “ Cephas ” in Paul ’s letter to the Galatians may be the earliest written mention of him , as some scholars believe that Paul wrote to the church in Galatia before any of the Gospels or other epistles were set down .
And Paul is consistent in his use ( see 1 Corinthians ) with only a couple of exceptions in Galatians .
Paul says that three years after his own conversion , he “ went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days ” ( Galatians 1:18 ; see also Acts 9:26–30 ) .
At this point , early in Church history , Cephas / Peter is specified as the main contact .
This is understandable from several perspectives .
As Paul later noted , Cephas was the first apostolic witness of Christ ’s resurrection .
He wrote , “ I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received : that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures , that he was buried , that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures , and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve ” ( 1 Corinthians 15:3 –5 ) .
This is indicated and confirmed in the Gospel accounts .
The women who visited the tomb only to find it empty were told : “ Do not be alarmed .
You seek Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified .
He has risen ; he is not here .
See the place where they laid him .
But go , tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee ” ( Mark 16:6 –7 ) .
Peter is again singled out .
The apostle John ’s account is similar ; it , too , emphasizes Peter ’s role in discovering Jesus ’ resurrection ( John 20:1 –8 ) .
The Gospel writer Luke makes reference to Peter in the account of two men who met the resurrected Jesus on the road from Jerusalem to nearby Emmaus .
Only after they sat down to eat together with Jesus and He disappeared from view did they realize who the stranger among them was .
Shocked , “ they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem .
And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together , saying , ‘ The Lord has risen indeed , and has appeared to Simon ! ’ ” ( Luke 24:33 –34 ) .
The Middle Years
When Paul went back to Jerusalem after 14 years , he again met Peter .
But this time it was to resolve a growing contention in the early Church — the idea that to become followers of Jesus , non-Jews must be circumcised .
Paul had taught that physical circumcision was not necessary for adult gentile believers .
To be sure that his teaching was in accord with that of the other apostles in Jerusalem , he went to see them privately .
The result , he says , was that “ when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised , just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised . . . James and Cephas and John . . . gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me , that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised ” ( Galatians 2:7–9 ) .
It is noticeable that Cephas is no longer the only apostle mentioned by name .
Here he is listed as one of three , with James first in order .
It may well be that by this time James , the brother of Jesus , had come to the fore as the leader of the Jerusalem church while the apostles traveled .
“ When Peter came to Antioch , I had to oppose him to his face , for what he did was very wrong . ”
In his letter to the Galatians , Paul is trying to set the congregations straight on a few points of doctrine .
The reference he makes to recent Church history is to support his case that what he has taught them is in fact in line with official teaching .
He mentions Cephas specifically , because Paul ’s opponents may have been using his poor example to support their case for circumcision .
He continues , “ When Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he stood condemned .
For before certain men came from James , he was eating with the Gentiles ; but when they came he drew back and separated himself , fearing the circumcision party ” ( Galatians 2:11 –12 ) .
So at this point , Peter displayed a partiality toward the gentile converts that did not match his belief and experience .
He was being hypocritical and leading others , such as Barnabas , astray .
The resolution of the problem was for all to come into line with the decision made at a special meeting in Jerusalem ( see Acts 15 ) .
There Paul , Barnabas and Peter recounted how the gentiles had come to conversion .
With their input and discussion with the apostles and elders , James , as Jerusalem leader , concluded that circumcision was not to be imposed on adult gentile converts .
That Peter was reconciled with Paul is obvious here .
Their relationship was clearly a brotherly one .
It was a relationship that survived the human characteristics each man had .
At the end of his life , Peter could refer to his colleague as “ our beloved brother Paul ” ( 2 Peter 3:15 ) .
There are other references to Peter in Paul ’s writings that show their friendship ( see 1 Corinthians 1:12 ; 3:22 ) .
Paul also makes an interesting aside that confirms Cephas ’s marital status .
He says , “ Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife , as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas ? ” ( 1 Corinthians 9:5 ) .
“ When they had finished breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , ‘ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? ’
He said to him , ‘ Yes , Lord ; you know that I love you . ’
He said to him , ‘ Feed my lambs . ’ ”
In John ’s Gospel , we read that Christ put Peter to the test with an exchange that upset him ( John 21:15 – 17 ) .
In a postresurrection appearance , Jesus asks him about the quality of his devotion : “ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? ”
Then twice more , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ”
When twice Peter replies , “ Yes , Lord ; you know that I love you , ” Jesus commands , “ Feed my lambs ” and “ Tend my sheep . ”
John notes that “ Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time , ‘ Do you love me ? ’ and he said to him , ‘ Lord , you know everything ; you know that I love you . ’
Jesus said to him , ‘ Feed my sheep . ’ ”
Peter learned a profound lesson in this exchange , one that would be tested as time went by in the Church ’s expansion .
Further , Jesus told him that his life in caring for the sheep would not be easy and in fact that he would pay the ultimate price — with his life : “ ‘ When you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go . ’
( This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God . )
And after saying this he said to him , ‘ Follow me ’ ” ( verses 18 –19 ) .
Like Jesus , Peter would end his life in martyrdom .
And here is an important point to understand .
If we want to be true followers of Christ , we must do so as He desires , not according to our own agendas .
Peter had to learn that .
The Apostle ’s Letters
When we study the New Testament record for details regarding the latter part of Peter ’s life , we come to two significant letters by his name .
Yet some have doubted that the letters are Peter ’s , and they advance several arguments to support this idea .
None are compelling , however .
With respect to the first letter , the English Standard Version Study Bible outlines the arguments and the answers .
One objection is that a Galilean fisherman would not have written such good Greek .
The answer is that Peter came from cross-cultural Galilee , where Greek was spoken .
A second objection is that his theology sounds too much like Paul’s .
This is an amusing one , because often the case is made that the apostle to the Jews and the apostle to the gentiles had very different theologies .
The answer to this objection is that it is not at all strange that two followers of Jesus should have the same beliefs .
In fact , it ’s what would be expected .
A further argument is that the Peter of the letters quotes the Septuagint , whereas the real Peter would have used the Hebrew Scriptures .
But why would n’t he use the Greek Old Testament when writing to Greek speakers ?
In a fourth objection , skeptics insist that Peter was already dead by the time the first letter was written , because they claim it reflects events in the Roman Empire at the end of the first century .
But there is no internal evidence to support this speculation .
Last , it ’s said that Peter does not refer to Jesus enough to demonstrate that he was the Peter who knew Him .
Answer :
This is a short letter for a specific purpose .
That said , Peter does refer to Jesus ’ teachings , as we will see .
The first letter begins : “ Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia , elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , in sanctification of the Spirit , for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace be multiplied ” ( 1 Peter 1:1 –2 , New King James Version ) .
The letter was probably written around the early 60s — in the reign of Emperor Nero — and is addressed to followers of Jesus in central and northern Asia Minor , just south of the Black Sea , in what is Turkish territory today .
The letter opens in a similar way to James ’s epistle .
It addresses believers who were predominantly gentile ( though some Jews would likely have been included ) in an area of the Diaspora where Jews had settled for at least two centuries after leaving their ancient homeland .
One commentator says that Peter addressed his readers as if they were Jewish followers of Jesus .
The order of the provinces listed is perhaps the way a courier would travel to them on an organized mail route .
Peter was setting down important foundational knowledge for believers .
He was getting old and perhaps sensing that he had little time left ( this becomes more apparent in the second letter ) , so he laid out fundamental truths to help everyone continue , despite difficulties .
His emphasis and the emphasis of the grammatical structure in the opening verses is that it is not Peter who is important , but rather the called and chosen readers .
He reminded them of the great calling given only to the few .
He noted that this is the last age of man ’s rule now that Christ has come ( 1 Peter 1:3–5 ) .
They were living in the space between the first and second comings .
This belief is what helps sustain God ’s people when things get difficult in this world .
When trials come , the hope of the future encourages them , and tests and trials are contextualized by the promise of Christ ’s second coming ( 1 Peter 1:6–9 ) .
Peter knew that the follower of Jesus might sometimes diminish the value of these trials and tests .
But he insisted that they are for our good — our learning — and that they benefit us eternally .
The calling to be a follower is based on spiritual knowledge that God has progressively revealed .
Our predecessors did not know what is now known following Christ ’s first coming .
Peter explained that “ the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully , inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when [ it ] predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories .
It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you , in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven , things into which angels long to look ” ( 1 Peter 1:10 – 12 ) .
The realization of this truth should lead to a mind that is convicted of the need to live a different life than the world around lives .
Modern translators have expressed Peter ’s words as “ preparing your minds for action ” ( 1 Peter 1:13 ) .
The Greek verb underlying this means wrapping around the waist the long clothing of those times .
A similar thought is found in Luke ’s Gospel , where Jesus uses a related verb to say , “ Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning ” ( Luke 12:35 ) .
The verse in 1 Peter is one of the places where Jesus ’ teaching is apparent .
Further , Peter reminds his readers of the goal of their conduct : “ As obedient children , do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance , but as he who called you is holy , you also be holy in all your conduct , since it is written , ‘ You shall be holy , for I am holy ’ ” ( 1 Peter 1:14 –16 ) .
One of the benefits of this knowledge is that believers can call on God the Father , the impartial judge .
His Son ’s sacrifice means that whatever we do that is wrong in this life can be blotted out , if we seek God ’s forgiveness ( 1 Peter 1:17 –21 ) .
Our purpose in doing this is to become more and more like the Father .
To do so , we have to have our minds in gear .
“ All men are like grass , and all their glory is like the flowers of the field ; the grass withers and the flowers fall , but the word of the Lord stands forever . ”
An important byproduct of having God ’s Spirit at work in us is the ability to love brothers and sisters who are of the same mind .
It also provides the important realization that this life is not all there is ; in fact , it ’s nothing by comparison with our destiny , and this truth sustains us : “ Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren , love one another fervently with a pure heart , having been born again , not of corruptible seed but incorruptible , through the word of God which lives and abides forever , because ‘ All flesh is as grass , and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass .
The grass withers , and its flower falls away , but the word of the LORD endures forever . ’
Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you ” ( 1 Peter 1:22 –25 , NKJV ) .
In chapter 2 , Peter takes the discussion of interpersonal responsibility a step further .
And that ’s where we ’ll pick up the story next time .
Sometimes you may need to figure out what branches exist on a remote repository so you can pull them down and check them out , merge them into your local branches , etc .
If you ’re using GitHub or gitweb to host your repository it ’s usually easy to determine the branch names , but if you need to get them in general or for scripts it ’s not exactly clear .
UPDATE :
The comments have enlightened me quite a bit … there seems to always be more than one way to skin a cat using Git .
The easiest way is just to use the git branch commands ’ various options .
- a shows all local and remote branches , while -r shows only remote branches .
$ git branch * master $ git branch -a * master origin/1-2- stable origin/2-0-stable origin/2-1-stable origin/2-2-stable origin/3-0-unstable origin/HEAD origin/ master $ git branch -r origin/1- 2- stable origin/2-0-stable origin/2-1-stable origin/2-2-stable origin/3-0-unstable origin/HEAD origin/ master
So , once you know the name of the branch it ’s quite simple to check them out .
If you have color options on it ’s also quite easy to tell which branches are n’t pulled down since they ’re listed in red .
There ’s also another way to do figure out what branches are on your remote by actually using the remote related commands , git remote and git ls-remote .
The former displays plenty of information about the remote in general and how it relates to your own repository , while the latter simply lists all references to branches and tags that it knows about .
$ git remote show origin * remote origin URL : git://github.com/rails/rails.git
Remote branch merged with ' git pull ' while on branch master master Tracked remote branches 1 - 2 - stable 2-0 - stable 2-1-stable 2-2-stable 3-0-unstable master $ git ls-remote -- heads origin 5b3f7563ae1b4a7160fda7fe34240d40c5777dcd refs/heads/1-2-stable 71926912a127da29530520d435c83c48778ac2b2 refs/heads/2-0-stable
2b158543247a150e8ec568becf360e7376f8ab84 refs/heads/2-1-stable b0792a3e7be88e3060af19bab01cd3d26d347e4c refs/heads/2-2-stable d6b9f8410c990b3d68d1970f1461a1d385d098d7 refs/heads/3-0-unstable
f04346d8b999476113d5e5a30661e07899e3ff80 refs/heads /master
The ls-remote command returns the SHA1 hash of the latest commit for that reference , so it is quite easy to parse out and get to the exact commit you need if you ’re doing some scripting .
The -- heads option lists only branch names since the command can list tags too .
If you have any other uses for these commands or an easier way to figure out branches that live on a remote , comment away !

The National newspaper sent in a link to their recent article about a rather interesting mall over in China .
That mall , we read , is " not just the world ’s largest .
With fewer than a dozen stores scattered through a space designed to house 1,500 , it is also the world ’s emptiest – a dusty , decrepit complex of buildings marked by peeling paint , dead light bulbs , and dismembered mannequins . "

Mall of misfortune

The people who work at the South China Mall , in the muggy , factory - filled city of Dongguan , have the honor of passing each day in the biggest shopping mall on the face of the planet .
In theory , it ’s a glorious place : a seven - million - square - foot retail - and - entertainment behemoth in the heart of China ’s southern Pearl River Delta , the wealthiest region in a nation that boasts the world ’s biggest population and its fastest - growing major economy .
The mall is part of China ’s new arsenal of superlatives : the world ’s largest airport terminal , the highest train track , the golf resort with the most holes .
The employees of this giant mall could , if they wanted , spend their breaks driving bumper cars , browsing for house - wares , strolling along a Venetian canal , petting fake herons in an indoor rain forest , or gazing at an eighty - five - foot replica of the Arc de Triomphe – all , of course , without leaving the premises .
They could also picnic next to the bell tower of St Mark ’s Square in Venice , soak up the ambience of San Francisco , or take a ride on the mall ’s indoor - outdoor roller coaster , a 553 - meter flying railway known as Kuayue Shi Kong , or “ Moving Through Time and Space ” .
As it happens , it ’s just those things – time and space – that give so much trouble to the workers here .
They have too much of both .
On a recent Friday afternoon , an amusement - park employee , slouched in a forsaken ticket booth , tried to kill time by making origami .
Another worker slept , with perfect impunity , on a table .
In front of the haunted house attraction , one attendant was doing hand - stands while two others looked blankly on .
There was nothing else to do , because the South China Mall , which opened with great fanfare in 2005 , is not just the world ’s largest .
With fewer than a dozen stores scattered through a space designed to house 1,500 , it is also the world ’s emptiest – a dusty , decrepit complex of buildings marked by peeling paint , dead light bulbs , and dismembered mannequins .
“ They set out to be the biggest , and hoped that being the biggest would be the attracting factor , ” says David Hand , a retail analyst at Jones Lang LaSalle in Beijing , who has followed the project .
“ It has n’t delivered . ”
The world has plenty of empty malls ; there ’s even an American website , deadmalls.com , where connoisseurs of desolation post photos and reminiscences of the once - great , now - gutted places where they spent the Saturday afternoons of their youth .
What sets the South China Mall apart from the rest , besides its mind - numbing size , is that it never went into decline .
The tenants did n’t jump ship ; they never even came on board .
The mall entered the world pre-ruined , as if its developers had deliberately created an attraction for people with a taste for abandonment and decay .
It is a spectacular real - estate failure – but it is also , as I saw when I spent two days exploring the site in May , a strangely beautiful monument to the big dreams that China inspires .
Three years ago , just before the South China Mall opened , it was featured on the front page of The New York Times as part of China ’s “ astonishing ” new consumer culture .
As the Times put it , with perhaps a trace of hyperbole , the “ Chinese have started to embrace America ’s ‘ shop till you drop ’ ethos and are in the middle of a buy - at - the - mall frenzy . ”
A spokesman for the mall ’s developer Hu Guirong , an instant - noodle billionaire , told the Times that Hu ’s team had spent two years traveling the world – France , Italy , Nevada – in search of ideas .
They expected the mall to average more than 70,000 visitors a day .
“ We wanted to do something groundbreaking , ” the spokesman said .
“ We wanted to leave our mark on history . ”
In making size the first consideration , Hu was following a general trend among mall developers , for whom the competition for the “ largest ” label can be as fierce as an arms race .
Consider the mall - building craze underway in the Emirates .
Its largest shopping center , the 2.4 - million - square - foot Mall of the Emirates , is only three years old , but will relinquish its throne this year to the even bigger Dubai Mall – which in turn will be superseded in 2010 by the gargantuan Mall of Arabia .
( Together , the three properties will contain about 10 million square feet of leasable space – more than two square feet for every resident of the country . )
And it ’s not enough for a 21st - century mall to have shops ; it must also have gondolas , trams , water slides , “ Olympic - sized ” hockey rinks , ice palaces or – in the case of the Dubai Mall – one of the world ’s largest aquariums , to be filled with 41,000 fish .
The big attraction of the South China Mall was supposed to be its “ foreign ” design .
Learning from Las Vegas , where replicas of European monuments and New York landmarks draw throngs of tourists , the Dongguan mall modeled seven zones after various exotic world locations .
Its rooftops reflect at least twenty different influences , from Czech town halls to Turkish mosques .
As the mall was about to open , one of its design consultants , Ian Thomas of the Thomas Consulting Group in Vancouver , told the trade publication Shopping Centers Today that the zones were “ done with such authenticity , with such great attention to detail , that you really think you ’re in the real thing . ”
The Arc de Triomphe that stands in the very middle of the South China Mall – one of the first things I saw upon arrival – bears eleven circular seals engraved with the name of the city that meant so much suffering for Napoleon ’s army : “ MOCSOW ” .
It takes a minute to figure out that the seals have been affixed upside - down .
The great arch leads you out of Paris and into either Venice or Amsterdam – it ’s hard to tell , since this half of the mall , where the pedestrian walkways are all outdoors , has never been finished .
The buildings have ornate , generically European facades , but their insides remain shells filled with puddles , unrailed staircases , and random stacks of tile and concrete .
The exotic palm trees lining the sidewalk have been invaded by homegrown south - China weeds .
A suspicious security guard , clearly elated to have something to do , turned me away from this section .
“ We just want to look at the tower , ” my translator told him , pointing to the red - brick Venetian campanile down at the end .
“ That ’s what they all say , ” he replied .
Back through the triumphal arch , past the never - opened Eagle Nest Bar , a sign heralds the entrance to San Francisco : “ Here you can find high - grade perfume from France , genuine leather items from Italy , as well as well known watches from Switzerland . ”
But there ’s nothing except vacant storefronts , with a couple of escalators sheathed in dust - covered plastic .
It ’s a relief to find Amazing World , the mostly outdoor amusement park on the east side of the mall .
On my first day , a Friday , a few dozen schoolchildren , bused in from more than an hour away , were enjoying the massive bright - colored rides .
The Action Arm , a giant yellow swing , flipped them around three hundred and sixty degrees , while the Drop Tower let them free - fall from twenty stories .
( The mall ’s English website asks , “ Do you dare to take a try – experience the feeling of ‘ death ’ ?
The answer is yes because the safety is ensured . ” )
A Mayan - themed flume would have looked pretty good too , if only it had n’t been drained of water .
On Saturday afternoon , a couple of hundred locals gathered in Amazing World .
Chen Xiaodong , a 23 - year - old insurance company worker , sat by the central pond with her boyfriend .
“ It ’s not very exciting , ” she said .
The two had already tried the rides and had considered looking for shops , but decided against it .
“ I did n’t want to go inside , ” she said , “ because there was a weird smell . ”
Exactly why the South China Mall failed so badly is a matter of some dispute .
Did the retailers hold back because there were no customers , or did the customers stay away because there were no retailers ?
Or did Hu Guirong doom the project by opening it before construction was finished – driving everybody away with the scaffolding and the dust ?
Dick Groves , a retail consultant based in nearby Hong Kong , chalks it up to inexperience in the leasing business , mixed with an undisciplined financial system .
“ When it ’s easy to get financing without having to convince someone of the project ’s feasibility , and without having to show pre-leasing commitment , you can start to get into trouble , ” he says .
“ It ’s all wrong , ” said a middle - aged man I met exploring the empty storefronts , who would n’t give his name because , he said , he ’s a rival developer .
“ It ’s too big .
It ’s too confusing .
But if it were in Guangzhou ” – a much bigger city , about forty miles away – “ you might have a chance . ”
The people at Hu Guirong ’s company , Sanyuan Yinhui , declined to be interviewed , but Edward deSwart , an industry veteran brought in last summer to turn the South China Mall around , thinks the location is fine .
“ It ’s a pretty good market , about 50 million people in the Pearl River Delta , ” he says .
“ We will draw from all the cities around , but it has to be a strong enough attraction . ”
DeSwart got hired after Sanyuan Yinhui sold a controlling stake in the mall to the Founders Group , a division of Beijing University .
“ Many developers [ in China ] have fallen into what I call the cowboy league , ” deSwart says , trying to explain how the mall ever got built .
“ Guys who all of a sudden have a lot of money and want to build a magnificent structure , without thinking it through . ”
Now he plans to “ wind the clock back ” and start completely over , leasing the mall in small phases over several years .
( The complex does have two fairly healthy anchors , a Spar department store and a B & Q housewares center , both of which can be entered without having to pass through the mall ’s interior . )
Hand , the retail expert from Jones Lang LaSalle , maintains that Chinese developers are learning quickly and that the market has great potential .
“ The Chinese love shopping , they love brands , and they love international products , even though the average income is low , ” he says .
“ New shoppers are born everyday .
We wo n’t run out of them . ”
“ It ’s so boring here , ” said Xia Qunyan , the shop assistant in Polo Meisdol , a leather - goods and clothing store whose logo contrives to emulate that of Ralph Lauren .
“ There ’s no business . ”
Xia , a friendly woman in her early thirties , rolled her eyes when reminded that she works in the world ’s biggest mall .
“ That ’s what they told us to get us here , ” she said .
Rent for the shop , located in a theoretically high - traffic spot next to an escalator , was originally 28,000 yuan ( Dh15,000 ) a month , but Xia says it ’s never been paid .
The company invested 230,000 yuan in renovations , she said , and since they ’re one of only four small retailers left , the mall gives them free rent .
On Friday , Xia passed the time chatting with a friend who ’d dropped by with her baby .
On Saturday , my translator and I found Xia alone , playing cards with herself .
At her suggestion , we sat down and played three rounds of a game called Catch the Landlord .
This section of the mall has four floors , and two levels above Xia ’s shop is a loud arcade , Dino ’s World , that blares techno music throughout the empty atrium .
There ’s also a huge Teletubbies playroom for kids , and a bridge leading off to the indoor section of Amazing World .
A tour of the section ’s 600 retail storefronts yields glimpses of what the South China Mall might have been ; in some parts , there are even signs for three or four stores in a row , most of them south Chinese or Hong Kong chains with eccentric English names .
You pass Kentex , Marino Orlandi , and Ebose , all empty .
US Eell , Wen Chun , IP Zone , Weekend Workshop – empty .
Balenno , Smitih ’s [ sic ] , Greenwood – empty .
Carslan – gated .
Henan Medicine – locked , full of pharmaceutical products , with an eviction notice for “ breach of contract ” .
Triumph International – empty but with an angry notice from the mall : “ According to records , the entity closed its business without first acquiring official permission from our company , thus constituting a breach of contract and directly affecting the image of the shopping center . ”
It ’s odd to find a store with an actual person in it , like S - Square , a small , stylish clothing store with black - painted walls .
Its 21 - year - old shop assistant , Miss Chen , said business was n’t so bad back when the mall first opened .
Rent was then 10,000 yuan , but it ’s no longer collected .
“ We used to get lots of tour groups , ” she said .
“ Now it ’s just student groups , and occasionally groups of factory workers , and they do n’t buy anything . ”
She gets “ one or two ” customers a day , and passes the hours reading magazines and sending text messages to her friends .
Miss
Chen often sends texts to Miss Peng , also 21 , who sits behind the cash register at Eyaya , an accessories shop that is just far enough around the corner to prevent the two ladies from chatting .
“ Our bosses say we could go into the corridor and yell down to each other , ” Miss Peng said .
“ I usually just stare into space .
Sometimes I get really sleepy and want to take a nap , but I get scared because at any time a customer could come in , and I might miss the only customer of the day . ”
Neither Peng nor Chen spends much time with Xia , over in Polo Meisdol .
“ There used to be a girl our age who worked there , ” Peng said , a little sadly .
“ Her astrological sign was a dragon , and we used to hang out sometimes .
But then she left . ”
About 500 new malls have been built in China over the last five years , estimates Kevin Jiang , a researcher at the Mall China Information Center .
All of them are waiting for the arrival of this coming mega - middle class , as are the rest of China ’s countless “ visionary ” development projects .
These include a from - scratch “ eco-city ” for 500,000 residents north of Shanghai , a compound of a hundred luxury villas in the Ordos desert of Inner Mongolia and a thousand - acre theme - park replica of the old imperial Summer Palace , which was destroyed by British and French troops in the nineteenth century .
The cowboy developers of China , like the bored employees of the South China Mall , are still waiting .
Some day – and they hope it ’s soon – this new middle class will finally show up to fill the empty spaces .
The malls will overflow , the stuff will sell , and the country will take its rightful place among the world ’s great consumer powers .
But until then , Xia Qunyan remains sitting on a stool in front of her shop , shuffling her playing cards and wondering how to pass the time .

[ digg - reddit - me ] I discovered John Updike when most people should – when I was about 13 .
Updike explained in an interview that he wrote his books aiming towards this existence as :
books on library shelves , without their jackets , years old , and a … teenaged boy finding them , having them speak to him .
And that is how I discovered them .
His books were depressing and yet exotic with a sad sexuality that I was enticed by but did not understand .
I read through the Rabbit Angstrom series as well as a number of other minor works .
Later , I rediscovered Updike in a novel which has scarcely been mentioned in his eulogies , Toward The End of Time , which seems to me to be exceptional .
It takes place after the end of civilization and the fall of the American government due to a war with the Chinese .
I still vividly remember the casual indifference of the narrator in what is , I think , a quintessential Updike quotation :
One advantage of the collapse of civilization is that the quality of the young women who are becoming whores has gone way up .
For me , this quotation demonstrates both the author ’s humor , the misogyny of his characters , the world - weariness , the carnality , the enforced normalcy and mundaniety .
As a man who would go on to write 61 books , Updike had an almost pathological need to write as his obituary in The New York Times made clear :
I would write ads for deodorants or labels for catsup bottles , if I had to .
The miracle of turning inklings into thoughts and thoughts into words and words into metal and print and ink never palls for me .
Given this compulsion to write , it ’s no surprise that Updike wrote in every form – short story , poetry , novel , criticism , nonfiction .
The New York Times called him :
a literary decathlete in our age of electronic distraction and willful specialization , Victorian in his industriousness and almost blogger - like in his determination to turn every scrap of knowledge and experience into words
Updike seemed to finding what meaning he did in life from his art :
But the work , the words on the paper , must stand apart from our living presences ; we sit down at the desk and become nothing but the excuse for these husks we cast off .
As his obituaries attempt to categorize his work , I ’m not sure anyone can do better than his near - contemporary , the similarly prolific , Joyce Carol Oates :
John Updike ’s genius is best excited by the lyric possibilities of tragic events that , failing to justify themselves as tragedy , turn unaccountably into comedies .
At his best , Updike described his work as giving “ the mundane its beautiful due . ”
These quotations below are either from my collection or in the various collections of Updike quotes online and in his obituaries :
He had returned to the archetypal sense of what a book was : it was an elemental sheaf , bound together by love and daring , to be passed with excitement from hand to hand .
Bech had expected the pathos , the implied pecking of furtive typewriters , but not the defiant beauty of the end result .
( jwcampbe . )
I think “ taste ” is a social concept and not an artistic one .
I ’m willing to show good taste , if I can , in somebody else ’s living room , but our reading life is too short for a writer to be in any way polite .
Since his words enter into another ’s brain in silence and intimacy , he should be as honest and explicit as we are with ourselves .
( Wikiquote . )
Sex is like money ; only too much is enough .
( The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations . )
To say that war is madness is like saying that sex is madness : true enough , from the standpoint of a stateless eunuch , but merely a provocative epigram for those who must make their arrangements in the world as given .
( Wikiquote . )
A leader is one who , out of madness or goodness , volunteers to take upon himself the woe of the people .
There are few men so foolish , hence the erratic quality of leadership in the world .
( The Telegraph . )
An affair wants to spill , to share it ’s glory with the world .
No act is so private it does not seek applause .
( The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations . )
He was bad at the business of life , which is letting go .
( jwcampbe )
To be President of the United States , sir , is to act as advocate for a blind , venomous , and ungrateful client .
( The Telegraph . )
In asking forgiveness of women for our mythologizing of their bodies , for being unreal about them , we can only appeal to their own sexuality , which is different but not basically different , perhaps , from our own .
For women , too , there seems to be that tangle of supplication and possessiveness , that descent toward infantile undifferentiation , that omnipotent helplessness , that merger with the cosmic mother - warmth , that flushed pulse - quickened leap into overestimation , projection , general mix - up .
( Wikiquote . )
Most of American life consists of driving somewhere and then returning home , wondering why the hell you went .
( ThinkExist . )
Truth should not be forced ; it should simply manifest itself , like a woman who has in her privacy reflected and coolly decided to bestow herself upon a certain man .
( BrainyQuote . )
I love my government not least for the extent to which it leaves me alone .
( BrainyQuote . )
We do survive every moment , after all , except the last one .

January 4 , 2009 -- A message from the Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions
Sisters and brothers :
The PGFTU has been working at all levels in Palestine and in its international relations to mobilise international support for peace in the region .
This is the ultimate goal for our working families in Palestine , who laboured in every way possible to bring about an end to the Israeli occupation of all Palestinian territories .
This occupation is the longest and worst in the modern history .
Over the years and even at this moment , these efforts have been met only with terrorism against our people by the Israeli army of occupation , which has indiscriminately destroyed homes and worksites , slaughtered our people , confiscated our land , established and expanded illegal settlements , and limited the movement of workers who are only trying to feed their families .
These measures have affected every member of the Palestinian society .
The recent construction of the Apartheid Wall stands as a symbol of the extent of Israel ’s brutal aggression against the Palestinian people and denial of their legitimate rights , dignity and human needs .
We call upon all peace - loving people in the world :
You are now witness to the criminal aggression by the Israeli army in its offensive in the Gaza Strip , bringing a new wave of killings and massacres against the Palestinian people by Israel as the occupying state .
These are war crimes according to international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions .
As our families in Gaza ( the poorest in the Middle East ) are being slaughtered nonstop for a week now , many of us are reliving what occurred in the summer of 2006 during the Israeli aggression against the people of Lebanon .
We witnessed then as we experience now waves of support and solidarity and similar anger and energy against this brutal injustice .
We cannot afford to let this surge of support pass us by without utilising the moment to build our movement to face future challenges .
The most important thing is to be aware and equipped .
We urgently ask you and your sister labour organisations to help us spread the message that “ WE ARE ALL GAZA ” – that this war is against all poor workers and families of the world .
These are not just crimes against the people of Palestine .
They are crimes against humanity .
Help us create a strong voice for the working families of Gaza by building coalitions with unions , faith groups , anti-war movements and all social justice organisations .
We join you in the hope that in the election of Barack Obama , he will fulfill his reputation as a pro-union anti-war candidate , and that he understands that the CHANGE he spoke about during the campaign must include a fundamental change in US foreign policy so that “ FREE GAZA .
… FREE PALESTINE ” becomes more than just a slogan .
We support and encourage your Boycott , Divestment and Sanction ( BDS ) efforts against Israel around the world , but especially in Europe and most particularly in the United States as a response to the harsh economic conditions , violations of labour and human rights , and other forms of oppression imposed by the illegal and immoral Israeli Apartheid occupation .
We ask you to stop US aid to Israel .
This becomes not only necessary but also a duty of international solidarity among labour unions around the world .
It is US government aid that provides Israel with the weapons of oppression and U.S. government support that enables them to use those weapons against our people .
We ask you to be an active player in raising funds to meet the bare necessities of food , medicine and medical supplies for the people of Gaza .
With your solidarity with our struggle for human rights and justice , we can transform this moment of crisis into a turning point for an end to the brutal occupation and a step toward the liberation of the people of Palestine .
With the will and determination of all the people , we can say “ FREE PALESTINE … YES WE CAN .
[ The Palestine General Federation of Trade Union is an independent democratic trade union federation .
It enjoys the full rights according to the valid national legislation .
It has been established in 1965 as an extension to the Palestinian labour movement struggle that started in 1921 in “ Haifa ” , it was known as the Arab Labourers ’ Society during the British mandate in Palestine . ]
Association of University Teachers in Gaza calls for help
January 4 , 2009 -- Bethlehem -- Ma an --
The Palestinian Association of University Teachers in Gaza calls upon all peace - loving , freedom - loving nations , NGOs , universities , intellectuals , cultural and academic institutions , trade unions and syndicates , as well as human rights organisations all over the world to :
1. Immediately impose boycotts , sanctions and divestments on the Apartheid Israeli state .
2 . Try the Israeli generals for their ongoing crimes against the Palestinian people .
3. Demand a halt to Israel 's savage aggression , end its brutal occupation and lift its suffocating and lethal siege on the Gaza Strip .
4. Implement all UN resolutions related to the inalienable national rights , particularly UN resolution 194 calling for the right of return for the Palestinian refugees to their homes and their property from which they were uprooted by the terrorist Zionist gangs in 1948 .
5. Comply with 4th article of the Geneva Convention , the international human rights law , the international humanitarian law , and the universal declaration of human rights as well as all other related agreements .
6 . Lift the draconian blockade against Gaza as stipulated by the 1948 Convention on Genocide , and consider anyone participating as a war criminal who must be tried for crimes against humanity .
Israel is a rogue state that is a threat and danger to world peace and security ; therefore she must be banished and punished by the international community , before it is too late for the people of Palestine , the people of Israel and the people in the surrounding countries .
End the carnage in Gaza -- Boycott the Israeli academy now !
From the Palestinian Federation of Unions of University Professors and Employees ( PFUUPE )
December 29 , 2008 -- The Palestinian Federation of Unions of University Professors and Employees condemns in the strongest possible terms the bombing today of the campus of the Islamic University in Gaza .
This wanton destruction of an academic institution is only the latest in the ongoing lethal campaign launched by the Israeli government and army against Palestinian society in the Gaza Strip .
This murderous rampage has caused over 300 deaths and the injury of close to 1500 Palestinians .
And the carnage continues with impunity .
We add our voice to the urgent appeal issued two days ago by the Palestinian Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions National Committee ( BNC ) * [ see first statement on this page ] urging international civil society not just to protest and condemn Israel 's massacre in Gaza , but also to join and intensify the international Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) campaign against Israel to end its impunity and to hold it accountable for its persistent violations of international law and Palestinian rights .
We agree that , without sustained , effective pressure by people of conscience the world over , Israel will continue with its gradual , rolling acts of genocide against the Palestinians , burying any prospects for a just peace under the blood and rubble of Gaza , Nablus and Jerusalem .
Today , at the height of the lethal Israeli assault against the Palestinian people in Gaza , we are met with deafening silence emanating from the Israeli academy .
Does it condone the murderous bombing campaign that its government is carrying out in the name of all Israelis ?
Are the members of the academy dutifully preparing for the reserve call - up just approved by their government , ready to serve in the death squads committing war crimes around the clock ?
Are Israeli universities willing to call for an end to the occupation ?
Are they going to cut their organic and deep - rooted ties with the military - security establishment ?
There is no doubt that the aggression against the Gaza Strip has reached horrendous proportions , described by many international public figures as constituting war crimes and a continuation of the ethnic cleansing unleashed sixty years ago .
We urge academics around the world to intensify their boycott of Israeli academic institutions , and to isolate the Israeli academy in international forums , associations of academics , and other international venues .
Israeli academic institutions are complicit in the entrenched system of oppression practiced by the Israeli state , and their silence at this critical moment is only the most vociferous indicator of this complicity .

They were left battered by farmer Jose Bové 's attacks on McDonald 's and bruised by the birth of the " freedom fry " .
But yesterday the French and the Americans proved they had the stomach for another gloriously messy food fight .
Less than a week before it leaves office , the Bush administration has sparked anger across the Atlantic by tripling the import duty rate on roquefort cheese to 300 % , a move which the US hopes will " shut down trade " in the sheep 's milk product by making it prohibitively expensive .
The decision , part of Washington 's attempts to force the EU into dropping its ban on hormone - treated beef , was greeted with disbelief by the French government and by farmers in the south - western Aveyron region who depend on the industry for their livelihoods .
" Maybe the Bush administration indulged itself by taking this decision just before it leaves , " Robert Glandieres , president of the roquefort producers ' group , told Reuters .
The tariff on roquefort , condemned as " incomprehensible and inadmissible " by the French government , will probably have a minimal effect , given exports to the US account for just 2 % of annual sales .
French farmers said it would mean " the end " for roquefort in the US and vowed to take " symbolic actions " in return .

Mr Brown said ministers would ' continue to consult on the matter ' Ministers have shelved plans to exempt MPs ' expenses details from the Freedom of Information Act , after the Tories and Lib Dems said they would fight it .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the government had thought it had cross-party agreement but would now " continue to consult on the matter " .
Campaigners said it was a victory for " people power " after a web protest .
The Conservatives accused ministers of a " U- turn " while the Lib Dems said it was a " humiliating climbdown " .
MPs were due to vote on Thursday on plans to exempt their expenses from the Freedom of Information ( FOI ) Act .
Free vote Labour MPs were to be ordered to vote through the changes , while the Tories and Lib Dems said they would instruct their MPs to vote against them .
Mr Brown was challenged about it by two Tory backbenchers at prime minister 's questions who asked why there " should there be one law for the people and another for politicians " .
At the start of PMQs Mr Brown told MPs there would be a free vote on the matter .
I believe all - party support is important and we will continue to consult on that matter
Gordon Brown
Q&A : What the row is all about Analysis :
At sixes and sevens on expenses
He said : " We thought we had agreement on the Freedom of Information Act as part of this wider package . "
" Recently that support that we believed we had from the main opposition party was withdrawn .
On this particular matter , I believe all - party support is important and we will continue to consult on that matter . "
But less than an hour later the government said the plan would be shelved .
' Not acceptable '
The High Court ruled last year that details of claims made under the second homes allowance , including receipts , should be published in the interests of transparency .
Campaigners had denounced the planned Commons vote as effectively overturning the High Court ruling and said MPs were trying to exempt themselves from a law had they created .
MPs will still vote on Thursday on separate proposals to tighten up auditing procedures , involving the National Audit Office in some checks , as well as some changes to the Commons rule book on expenses and a move to publish expenses under 26 headings - previously they were published under nine .
The Conservatives denied they had initially struck a deal with Labour not to oppose the changes .
Shadow Commons leader Alan Duncan said it was " not acceptable " that , having made the FOI law , MPs could go back and change it because they did not like it .
Some MPs are clearly desperate to prevent the release of past expenses claims
Maurice Frankel
Campaign for Freedom of Information " I do n't think that retrospective escape route was really acceptable , " he said .
He said the government had " backed down " because the Tories had decided to whip their MPs to vote against it .
The Lib Dems , who described the FOI exemption proposal as " outrageous " , said the decision was a " humiliating climbdown " by the government .
" It is also a victory for everyone who thinks that politicians should be open and accountable to the people who pay their wages , " said party leader Nick Clegg .
' Robust audit ' Freedom of information campaigners welcomed the decision , saying the proposal to limit disclosure would have made MPs the only public officials immune from public scrutiny .
But they warned it was not the end of the matter and similar plans could resurface in future .
Maurice Frankel , director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said : " Some MPs are clearly desperate to prevent the release of past expenses claims which are likely to have exceeded what could reasonably be justified to the public . "
An internet campaign by MySociety urging MPs to vote against the change attracted more than 6,000 supporters on the Facebook website .
Peter Facey , of pressure group Unlock Democracy , warned if the vote had gone ahead it would have had " a catastrophic impact on the reputation of Parliament . "
He urged the Commons to publish all expenses details " at the earliest opportunity " .
But Commons leader Harriet Harman told the BBC publishing all 1.2 million receipts would have created " a blizzard of information at great expense " and new proposals being debated on Thursday would provide a " robust audit " of claims .
Asked in the Commons if all receipts would now be published , she said she had not yet been able to speak to the House of Commons authorities - who are responsible for holding the information - as to " how they intend to proceed " .
However she said the government would proceed with a plan to publish expenses claims under 26 headings as it would " provide information to members of the public without it having been requested " for all MPs .

Old Earth Creationism Geology Biology Theistic Evolution :
Evolution by natural processes is the tool God used Yes Yes Evolutionary Creationism :
Adam and Eve were the first spiritually aware humans Yes Yes Progressive Creationism :
Humans were a special creation event Yes Most Day - Age Creationism :
Six days of creation were six geological epochs Yes Some Gap Creationism :
4.5 billion year gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2 Yes Some Young Earth Creationism Geology Biology Omphalism :
Earth was created with the appearance of age and of evolution Yes Yes Young Earth Fundamentalism :
Invented versions of all natural sciences to explain Earth 's age as 6,000 years No No If you 've listened to the news at all within the last few years , you know that there 's one topic which is always in the headlines .
It 's more lasting than terrorism , more pervasive than politics , and more personal than global warming .
It 's the war over religion ; specifically , having religion taught as scientific fact .
Replacing science with creationism .
Whether it 's Tennessee v. Scopes in 1925 or Kitzmiller v. Dover in 2005 , religion versus science is always front and center .
Watching the news you 've seen the $ 27 million Creation Museum in Kentucky , the largest and newest of the several museums throughout the United States depicting Biblical literalism as an alternative view of natural history .
Dioramas show early farmers using small dinosaurs as beasts of burden .
Dramatic displays show how Noah 's flood created the Grand Canyon and all major geological features in a few days a few thousand years ago , and even give insight into how Noah kept all the dinosaur species on board his 600 - foot ark .
Most reasonable people are shocked by these flagrant attacks against intelligence .
Does this mean that everyone who calls himself a creationist is certifiably insane ?
As we see in so many aspects of our culture , it 's usually the loudest and most outrageous fringe minority that makes the most noise and gets the most headlines .
Rest assured that most creationists do not believe that Jesus rode around on a saddled Triceratops .
There are , in fact , a number of different types of creationism .
These variations conflict with one another and are mutually exclusive , and they are at varying odds with science .
The movement called Intelligent Design is not a type of creationism , or indeed any particular set of beliefs , so it will not be included in this discussion of the various types of creationism .
Intelligent Design is a blanket concept intended to show that the scientific method alone is not adequate to explain the natural world , and that a divine creator is a required component for any complete explanation of nature .
All types of creationists rally under the banner of Intelligent Design with the explicit goal of getting a foot in the door to force their particular belief system to be taught as fact in public schools .
These types of creationists fall into two main classifications : Young Earth Creationists , who believe that the Earth is between six and ten thousand years old ; and Old Earth Creationists , who generally accept the scientific measurement of the Earth 's age at 4.5 billion years old .
Within these classifications are other irreconcilable differences , which we 'll now go through one by one .
Let 's start with the forms of Old Earth Creationism .
I 'm going to describe five basic types .
Philosophers and adherents will probably quarrel with my chosen five , as there are others , and there are undoubted overlaps between these , and many believers combine aspects from two or more .
But let 's stick with these five as being representative .
Here they are , in order of how well they reconcile with science , starting with the best : Theistic Evolution .
This is the Catholic Pope 's officially stated position , and it 's embraced by many real scientists of faith .
Theistic evolution accepts both the geologic and biologic records , including modern evolutionary synthesis , and posits that these are simply the tools God chose to create the natural world .
Theistic evolution allows and embraces scientific research and permits the acceptance of new information .
Evolutionary Creationism also accepts the geologic and biologic records , and makes its creationist distinction in that there were a literal Adam and Eve who were simply the first spiritually aware humans , though they came into being in the same way as all early humans .
Progressive Creationism goes one step farther .
Progressive Creationism accepts the geologic record , and much of the prehistoric biologic record , including the true age of dinosaurs and other early lifeforms , but believes that the creation of humans and perhaps other modern animals was a special creationism event as literally depicted in Genesis .
Thus , there can be no biological link between humans and early hominids from the fossil record .
Day - Age Creationism is the belief that the six days of creation were really six geological epochs .
Usually some effort is made to reconcile specific days in Genesis to specific epochs in Earth history , but since things did n't really all happen separately and consecutively like in Genesis , such efforts are generally somewhat ham - handed .
But at least they 're trying .
Day - Age Creationism is what Jehovah 's Witnesses advocate in their Watchtower pamphlets .
Gap Creationism is about as far as the Old Earth model can be stretched .
This model attempts to unify the true age of the Earth as measured by science with the literal Biblical account .
Jimmy Swaggart advocates this model .
Gap Creationism states that the first verse of the Bible , God created the heavens and the Earth , was followed by a " gap " of 4.5 billion years , during which time not much happened .
And then , the literal creation of Genesis took place in six days about six to ten thousand years ago .
Necessarily , this model has to abandon evolution completely , although it adheres to proper geology .
Now we move to the other half of creationist models , the Young Earth Creationism .
Here we are forced to completely abandon reason and rationality .
There are really only two main camps , and as you can see , they are completely at odds with one another , agreeing only on a single point :
That the Earth did not exist ten thousand years ago .
Let 's now examine these two types of Young Earth Creationism , and once again we 'll take them in order of how closely they adhere to real science : Omphalism .
This is named after the 1857 book Omphalos , published two years before Darwin 's Origin of Species , which explained that the fossil record was God 's way of making the Earth appear to be old .
Omphalos is Greek for navel , and the Omphalists believe that Adam and Eve were created with navels , thus having the appearance of being created through normal evolutionary biology .
Adherents to Omphalism fully accept every scientific measurement of the age of the Earth and every discovery of modern biology , with the important exception that all such discoveries are wrong :
God only wanted to make us think that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old , and that life evolved from lower forms .
A true scientist doing real research can be an Omphalist .
He will arrive at the correct conclusions , though he will believe that his measurement is merely what God wants him to see .
Modern Young Earth Fundamentalism .
Here is where the train jumps completely off the tracks .
Modern Young Earthers , for lack of a better name , are the ones behind the Creation Museum discussed earlier .
They honestly believe in alternate versions of virtually every science known , throwing away every shred of modern science that does n't point to the age of the Earth as 6,000 years .
They literally believe in Adam and Eve ( without navels ) and all the dinosaurs on Day 1 , fossilization taking only a few hundred years , and all major geologic features having been created in a few days in Noah 's Flood .
They reject evolution , cosmology , geology , and every science that supports them ; which , by extension , eventually includes every scientific discipline .
However , in their minds , they do n't reject them at all ; they fully embrace completely wrong , misinterpreted , misunderstood , and misrepresented versions of them .
Their worldview is based absolutely on the Bible as a perfect , unerring , literal historical account .
As a followup , they have invented their own versions of natural sciences that they pretend supports this view .
It is not possible to be a thoroughly researched Young Earther and still retain any grasp on rationality .
This is the group making the overwhelming majority of noise in the media and modern culture , but it 's not clear how large of a group this really is .
They have the largest and loudest web presence , with AnswersInGenesis.org and the Discovery Institute , though out of 3.2 million Ph.D. 's worldwide they 've only been able to find 700 who agree with their science , according to their list maintained at DissentFromDarwin.org .
This represents 2 % of 1 % of people with advanced academic degrees .
It is scary but true - this display at the Creation Museum shows that Young Earth Fundamentalists honestly believe that people rode around on saddled dinosaurs , and that Noah had them all on the ark So as you can see , the battle is not simply between science and creation .
It 's really more between the various forms of creationism , and especially between the modern Young Earthers and everyone else .
There are perfectly rational ways to blend what we 've learned through the scientific method with divine guidance , if that 's your cup of tea .
There are even reasonably , or at least relatively , rational ways to accept the gist of Genesis and still maintain a grip on reality .
The majority of creationists are not entirely disconnected from reason .
Even people like the Jehovah 's Witnesses , who are often thought of as fringe fundamentalists , make an attempt to keep their beliefs reconciled with modern science .
So long as this focus is maintained , we can be reasonably assured that our educational system is not headed for the proverbial rubber room .

DAKAR , Senegal ( AP )  Ugandan rebels in eastern Congo have ruthlessly killed at least 620 people in the past month , human rights groups said over the weekend .
The Uganda rebel group , the Lord ’s Resistance Army , hacked to death villagers in its path as it fled a multinational military offensive aimed at driving it out of northeastern Congo .
In December , it appeared that the rebels had killed nearly 200 people .
The significantly higher figure comes from a two - week mission to the region by the New York - based group Human Rights Watch and the Congolese rights group Justice Plus .
In a statement , Human Rights Watch said that many of the attacks appeared to have been premeditated and that victims ’ skulls had been crushed with wooden bats and axes .
This weekend 's bushfires in Victoria are more deadly for the state than Ash Wednesday , as the death toll stands at 50 and is expected to rise .
The human toll is compounded by the loss of at least 640 homes but the true extent of the damage is not yet clear .
Authorities suspect arsonists are responsible for some fires .
Six of the confirmed dead have been found at Kinglake , six at Kinglake West and four each at St Andrews and Wandong , all north of Melbourne .
Five people are dead in Callignee , three in Hazelwood and one in Jeeralang .
More bodies have been found at Humevale , Bendigo , Upper Callignee , Long Gully , Strathewan and Arthurs Creek .
Victoria 's deputy police commissioner Kieran Walshe says the death toll will rise and it is expected to include children .
The town of Marysville north of Melbourne has been all but destroyed and there are grave fears for nearby Kinglake , where residents have described a " town on fire " .
A fire in Beechworth in the state 's north - east has grown to around 25,000 hectares after the wind changed from west to south - west around midday .
Houses there have come under ember attack and power lines are also under threat .
Meanwhile the blazes which have razed homes just north of Melbourne have grown to more than 210,000 hectares and are burning towards Glenburn , Taggerty and Rubicon .
' Helpless '
Emergency Services Commissioner Bruce Esplin said he felt numb after watching fires leave authorities almost helpless .
" Nature gave Victoria a beating of unimaginable proportions , " he told ABC Local Radio .
He says the deaths are an awful reminder that people should be prepared to leave their homes early .
" Bushfire risk is real , it 's horribly real .
It can become an awful reality with little warning and no second chance , " he said .
" You can rebuild a house but you can't rebuild a life . "
He says exhausted fire fighters - both paid and volunteer - may not get much chance to rest .
" Summer 's not over yet , this fire 's not over yet .
Fire services are n't just going round blacking out , they 're trying to put fires out .
" The Victorian summer is a long way from over and there 'll almost certainly be more bushfires . "
Murrindindi Shire Mayor Lyn Gunter is among residents believed to have lost homes in the Flowerdale area .
Fire authorities are struggling to get into the centre of the towns to survey the full scale of the damage , and ambulance services in Kinglake say they are being overwhelmed by calls for help .
Police say 514 homes in Kinglake have been lost .
ABC reporter Jane Cowan earlier described the horrific scene in Marysville .
" We were in the main street and it's like a warzone , like a bomb has been dropped on the entire township , " she said .
" People there are in an absolute state of shock .
Most people had already left , but the people , I 'd say about 30 people that are still left and had spent the night sheltering on the Football Oval there , are just completely dazed .
" [ They are ] walking around the streets with rugs around their shoulders because it 's actually getting cold here now , if you can believe it .
" There are stories of households that sheltered three families in one house .
Of gas bottles from nearby houses exploding and then piercing their houses and then those houses catching fire as well .
It 's an absolute warzone .
" People are saying that there are bodies in the town , terrible stories of for instance a woman who was found in her car this morning , obviously , was trying to escape .
She did n't make it .
She had her crockery on the seat beside her in the car . "
Last house standing
Great - grandmother Olga Tuckerman said she had God on her side when a blaze swept through Bendigo 's western suburbs , in central Victoria .
She said she returned to Bendigo today to find her house standing alone amid a mass of smoking , razed houses .
" Someone up there was looking out for me , " Mrs Tuckerman told Australian Associated Press .
But her neighbours were not as lucky .
Jean Perkins , 72 , returned to find smoking ruins where her house used to be .
" I said a couple of prayers yesterday - please keep my home Lord , but he wanted to take mine for some reason , " she said .
An ABC reporter in Labertouche today told Local Radio people were shell - shocked after the Bunyip fire , east of Melbourne , had engulfed surrounding forests and property yesterday .
She said high winds pushed walls of fire over houses in the area at enormous speed yesterday .
She described an interview she was conducting when the wind changed in the middle of the Saturday .
" We felt a strong gust of wind during the interview , we stopped the interview and in almost an instant the fire came over , " she said .
" You can be prepared as you like but nothing gets you ready for that . "
Lightning threat
There is cool weather forecast for the next few days which is expected to make conditions easier for fire fighters .
But with no prospect of decent rainfall , lightning strikes could start more fires .
John Coleridge from the Alfred Hospital has likened the influx of burns victims to the aftermath of the Bali bombings .
" Everybody was called in large numbers , " he said .
" And they would have burns and blast victims there , so that would be the only parallel that I can think of . "
The Victorian Health Minister , Daniel Andrews , says 78 people have been admitted to hospitals throughout the state with various burns , and hundreds of others have turned up at emergency departments , with less serious injuries .
Arson suspected
CFA officials say they suspect at least one arsonist of relighting fires that had burnt out , and lighting new fires ahead of existing fire fronts .
" To think you could do that yesterday in those conditions when you knew that any fire you lit had the potential to cause severe losses and death , I think that 's something that is just appalling , " said Victorian Emergency Services Minister , Bob Cameron .
Federal Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull added to the calls to hunt down firebugs .
" It is difficult to imagine a more horrific crime than arson , " he said in Sydney .
" All Australians will expect the authorities to want the police to ... be absolutely relentless in tracking down those responsible and ensuring they 're brought to justice . "
Victoria has accepted an offer from the Federal Government for the Defence Force to be drafted in to help with the fires .
The Emergency Services Minister , Bob Cameron , says the army has bulldozers and other equipment that can be used to strengthen containment lines .

A Pittsfield Township teen who disappeared this past weekend flew to Puerto Rico to be with a 26 - year - old New Jersey man she met through a live Internet chat for Xbox gamers , according to the girl 's mother .
The frantic three - day search for 16 - year - old Jasmine Rieberger ended Tuesday when she was found safe about 40 miles outside of San Juan .
Rieberger was found in Bayamon , one of Puerto Rico 's most populated cities , by Interpol and the Puerto Rico Missing Children 's Center .
She was returned to her father on Tuesday afternoon .
Authorities detained the 26 - year - old New Jersey man she was with and are continuing their investigation , Pittsfield Township police Lt. Steve Heller said .
Heller declined to discuss specifics of the man 's relationship with Reiberger but said detectives pursued information provided by the teen 's family that steered them to a New Jersey man with an address in Puerto Rico .
In an appearance today on ABC's Good Morning America Show , the girl 's mother , Stacey Rieberger , said her daughter had met the man through the live chat function on her Xbox computer game .
Heller said five police agencies in Michigan , New Jersey and Puerto Rico , as well as the FBI , and the Bureau for Immigration and Customs Enforcement , assisted with the investigation .
" It 's just so much relief .
There 's no words , " Stacey Rieberger said in the telephone interview shortly after receiving the news Tuesday afternoon .
By Tuesday evening , the teenager was back in the hotel room with her father and grandfather after being questioned by authorities .
The family had been searching for her for three days - involving authorities in both the United States and Puerto Rico - and drumming up attention online and in the news media .
The girl told her parents Saturday she was going to a friend 's house , but instead drove to Metro Airport where she took a flight to Puerto Rico .
The family discovered her missing when they called the friend 's house .
The girl left a note telling her family she was not kidnapped and indicated she was going to take up boxing in Puerto Rico .

An Ontario judge has ordered a party to a civil litigation case arising from a motor vehicle accident to hand over the contents of their private Facebook profile .
Importantly , the judge ruled that " a party who maintains a private , or limited access , Facebook profile stands in no different position than one who sets up a publicly - available profile . "
The judge seems to have arrived at that conclusion based on her understanding of Facebook :
a court can infer from the social networking purpose of Facebook , and the applications it offers to users such as the posting of photographs , that users intend to take advantage of Facebook ’s applications to make personal information available to others .
From the general evidence about Facebook filed on this motion it is clear that Facebook is not used as a means by which account holders carry on monologues with themselves ; it is a device by which users share with others information about who they are , what they like , what they do , and where they go , in varying degrees of detail .
Facebook profiles are not designed to function as diaries ; they enable users to construct personal networks or communities of “ friends ” with whom they can share information about themselves , and on which “ friends ” can post information about the user .

We all make mistakes running our websites .
However , the nature of those mistakes varies depending on the size of your company .
As your organization grows , the mistakes change .
We all make mistakes running our websites .
However , the nature of those mistakes varies depending on the size of your company .
As your organization grows , the mistakes change .
This post addresses common mistakes among large organizations .
Most of the clients I work with are large organizations : universities , large charities , public sector institutions and large companies .
Over the last 7 years , I have noticed certain recurring misconceptions among these organizations .
This post aims to dispel these illusions and encourage people to face the harsh reality .
The problem is that if you are reading this post , you are probably already aware of these things .
But hopefully this article will be helpful to you as you convince others within your organization .
In any case , here are our 10 harsh truths about websites of large organizations .
You may want to take a look at related articles :
1. You Need A Separate Web Division
In many organizations , the website is managed by either the marketing or IT department .
However , this inevitably leads to a turf war , with the website becoming the victim of internal politics .
In reality , pursuing a Web strategy is not particularly suited to either group .
IT may be excellent at rolling out complex systems , but it is not suited to developing a friendly user experience or establishing an online brand .
Zeldman urges organisations to create a separate web division .
Marketing , on the other hand , is little better .
As Jeffrey Zeldman puts it in his article Let there be Web divisions :
The Web is a conversation .
Marketing , by contrast , is a monologue …
And then there ’s all that messy business with semantic markup , CSS , unobtrusive scripting , card - sorting exercises , HTML run-throughs , involving users in accessibility , and the rest of the skills and experience that do n’t fall under Marketing ’s purview .
Instead , the website should be managed by a single unified team .
Again , Zeldman sums it up when he writes :
Put them in a division that recognizes that your website is not a bastard of your brochures , nor a natural outgrowth of your group calendar .
Let there be Web divisions .
2. Managing Your Website Is A Full - Time Job
Not only is the website often split between marketing and IT , it is also usually under - resourced .
Instead of there being a dedicated Web team , those responsible for the website are often expected to run it alongside their “ day job . ”
When a Web team is in place , it is often over - stretched .
The vast majority of its time is spent on day - to - day maintenance rather than longer - term strategic thinking .
This situation is further aggravated by the fact that the people hired to “ maintain ” the website are junior members of the staff .
They do not have the experience or authority to push the website forward .
It is time for organizations to seriously invest in their websites by hiring full - time senior Web managers to move their Web strategies forward .
3. Periodic Redesign Is Not Enough
Because corporate websites are under - resourced , they are often neglected for long periods of time .
They slowly become out of date with their content , design and technology .
Eventually , the website becomes such an embarrassment that management steps in and demands that it be sorted .
This inevitably leads to a complete redesign at considerable expense .
As I point out in the Website Owners Manual , this a flawed approach .
It is a waste of money because when the old website is replaced , the investment put into it is lost , too .
It is also tough on finances , with a large expenditure having to be made every few years .
Cameron
Moll encourages web designers to realign their website rather than redesign .
A better way is continual investment in your website , allowing it to evolve over time .
Not only is this less wasteful , it is also better for users , as pointed out by Cameron Moll in his post Good Designers Redesign , Great Designers Realign .
4. Your Website Cannot Appeal To Everyone
One of the first questions I ask a client is , “ Who is your target audience ? ” I am regularly shocked at the length of the reply .
Too often , it includes a long and detailed list of diverse people .
Inevitably , my next question is , “ Which of those many demographic groups are most important ? ”
Depressingly , the answer is usually that they are all equally important .
The harsh truth is that if you build a website for everyone , it will appeal to no one .
It is important to be extremely focused about your audience and cater your design and content to it .
Does this mean you should ignore your other users ?
Not at all .
Your website should be accessible by all and not offend or exclude anybody .
However , the website does need to be primarily aimed at a clearly defined audience .
5. You Are Wasting Money On Social Networking
I find it encouraging that website managers increasingly recognize that a Web strategy is more than running a website .
They are beginning to use tools such as Twitter , Facebook and YouTube to increase their reach and engage with new audiences .
However , although they are using these tools , too often they do so ineffectively .
Tweeting on a corporate account or posting sales demonstrations on YouTube misses the essence of social networking .
Microsoft dramatically improved its image amoung the development community by allowing Microsoft staff to speak out via the Channel 9 website .
Social networking is about people engaging with people .
Individuals do not want to build relationships with brands and corporations .
They want to talk to other people .
Too many organizations throw millions into Facebook apps and viral videos when they could spend that money on engaging with people in a transparent and open away .
Instead of creating a corporate Twitter account or indeed even a corporate blog , encourage your employees to start Tweeting and blogging themselves .
Provide guidelines on acceptable behavior and what tools they need to start engaging directly with the community connected to your products and services .
This demonstrates not only your commitment to the community but also the human side of your business .
6. Your Website Is Not All About You
Where some website managers want their website to appeal to everybody , others want it to appeal to themselves and their colleagues .
A surprising number of organizations ignore their users entirely and base their websites entirely on an organizational perspective .
This typically manifests itself in inappropriate design that caters to the managing director ’s personal preferences and contains content full of jargon .
A website should not pander to the preferences of staff but should rather meet the needs of its users .
Too many designs are rejected because the boss “ does n’t like green . ”
Likewise , too much website copy contains acronyms and terms used only within the organization .
7 . You ’re Not Getting Value From Your Web Team
Whether they have an in - house Web team or use an external agency , many organizations fail to get the most from their Web designers .
Web designers are much more than pixel pushers .
They have a wealth of knowledge about the Web and how users interact with it .
They also understand design techniques , including grid systems , white space , color theory and much more .
Treating designers as pixel pushers wastes their design experience : post from Twitter complaining about being a pixel pusher
It is therefore wasteful to micro-manage by asking them to “ make the logo bigger ” or to “ move that 3 pixels to the left . ”
By doing so , you are reducing their role to that of a software operator and wasting the wealth of experience they bring .
If you want to get the maximum return on your Web team , present it with problems , not solutions .
For example , if you ’re targeting your website at teenage girls , and the designer goes for corporate blue , suggest that your audience might not respond well to that color .
Do not tell him or her to change it to pink .
This way , the designer has the freedom to find a solution that may even be better than your choice .
You allow your designer to solve the problem you have presented .
8. Design By Committee Brings Death
The ultimate symbol of a large organization ’s approach to website management is the committee .
A committee is often formed to tackle the website because internal politics demand that everybody has a say and all considerations be taken into account .
To say that all committees are a bad idea is naive , and to suggest that a large corporate website could be developed without consultation is fanciful .
However , when it comes to design , committees are often the kiss of death .
Design by committee leads to design on the fly .
Design is subjective .
The way we respond to a design can be influenced by culture , gender , age , childhood experience and even physical conditions ( such as color blindness ) .
What one person considers great design could be hated by another .
This is why it is so important that design decisions be informed by user testing rather than personal experience .
Unfortunately , this approach is rarely taken when a committee is involved in design decisions .
Instead , designing by committee becomes about compromise .
Because committee members have different opinions about the design , they look for ways to find common ground .
One person hates the blue color scheme , while another loves it .
This leads to designing on the fly , with the committee instructing the designer to “ try a different blue ” in the hopes of finding middle ground .
Unfortunately , this leads only to bland design that neither appeals to nor excites anyone .
9. A CMS Is Not A Silver Bullet
Many of the clients I work with have amazingly unrealistic expectations of CMS ( content management systems ) .
Those without one think it will solve all of their content woes , while those who have one moan about it because it has n’t !
It is certainly true that a CMS can bring a lot of benefits .
These include :
reducing the technical barriers of adding content ,
allowing more people to add and edit content ,
facilitating faster updates ,
and allowing greater control .
However , many CMS are less flexible than their owners would like .
They fail to meet the changing demands of the websites they manage .
Website managers also complain that their CMS is hard to use .
However , in many cases , this is because those using it have not been adequately trained or are not using it regularly enough .
Finally , a CMS may allow content to be easily updated , but it does not ensure that content will be updated or even that the quality of content will be acceptable .
Many CMS - based websites still have out - of - date content or poorly written copy .
This is because internal processes have not been put in place to support the content contributors .
If you look to a CMS to solve your website maintenance issues , you will be disappointed .
10 . You Have Too Much Content
Part of the problem with content maintenance on large corporate websites is that there is too much content in the first place .
Most of these websites have “ evolved ” over years , with more and more content having been added .
At no stage has anybody reviewed the content and asked what could be taken away .
Many website managers fill their website with copy that nobody will read .
This happens because of :
A fear of missing something : by putting everything online , they believe users will be able to find whatever they want .
Unfortunately , with so much information available , it is hard to find anything .
: by putting everything online , they believe users will be able to find whatever they want .
Unfortunately , with so much information available , it is hard to find anything .
A fear users will not understand : whether from a lack of confidence in their website or in their audience , they feel the need to provide endless instruction to users .
Unfortunately , users never read this copy .
: whether from a lack of confidence in their website or in their audience , they feel the need to provide endless instruction to users .
Unfortunately , users never read this copy .
A desperate desire to convince : they are desperate to sell their product or communicate their message , and so they bloat the text with sales copy that actually conveys little valuable information .
Steve Krug , in his book Do n’t Make Me Think , encourages website managers to “ Get rid of half the words on each page , then get rid of half of what ’s left . ”
This will reduce the noise level on each page and make the useful content more prominent .
Conclusions
Large organizations do a lot right in running their websites .
However , they also face some unique challenges that can lead to painful mistakes .
Resolving these problems means accepting that mistakes have been made , overcoming internal politics and changing the way you control your brand .
Doing so will give you a significant competitive advantage and allow your Web strategy to become more effective over the long term .

Quick :
What fundamental principle do all of the following have in common ?
Two children drawing with crayons .
Three customers at Starbucks adding cream to their coffee .
Four processes running on a CPU core .
Five threads updating an object protected by a mutex .
Six threads running on different processors updating the same lock - free queue .
Seven modules using the same reference - counted shared object .
Answer :
In each case , multiple users share a resource that requires coordination because not everyone can use it simultaneously  and such sharing is the root cause of all resulting contention that will degrade everyone 's performance .
( Note :
The only kind of shared resource that does n't create contention is one that inherently requires no synchronization because all users can use it simultaneously without restriction , which means it does n't fall into the description above .
For example , an immutable object can have its unchanging bits be read by any number of threads or processors at any time without synchronization . )
In this article , I 'll deliberately focus most of the examples on one important case , namely mutable ( writable ) shared objects in memory , which are an inherent bottleneck to scalability on multicore systems .
But please do n't lose sight of the key point , namely that " sharing causes contention " is a general principle that is not limited to shared memory or even to computing .
The Inherent Costs of Sharing
Here 's the issue in one sentence : Sharing fundamentally requires waiting and demands answers to expensive questions .
As soon as something is shared in a way that does n't allow unlimited simultaneous use , we are forced to partially or fully serialize access to it .
The word " serialize " should leap out as a bright red flag -- it is the inverse and antithesis of " parallelize , " and a fundamental enemy of scalability .
That the very act of sharing a thing demands overhead is inherent in the notion of sharing itself , not only in software ; it applies equally to " one child at a time can use the blue crayon " as to " one process at a time can write to the file " and " one writer at a time can use the shared object . "
That we 're forced to serialize access , in turn , means two things : we are forced to ( potentially ) wait , and we are also forced to start answering expensive questions like : " Can I use it now ? "
Computing the answer to any question in software costs CPU cycles .
But these are more expensive questions , because answering them requires agreement at many levels of the system  across software threads and processes , and across hardware processors and memory subsystems  and getting that agreement can cost substantial communication and synchronization overhead that 's not even visible in the source code .
A Roadmap
Table 1 helps to map out these costs by breaking down their sources ( rows ) and how they manifest ( columns ) , and giving examples of each case .
The rows categorize the sources into three kinds of sharing overhead , where the first two are fundamental and the third arises when attempts to optimize these costs fail :
Blocking progress ( fundamental ) : Sharing requires waiting .
Clearly , when one client has exclusive access to the resource , some or all other clients must wait idly and are unable to make progress .
( The worst case is when a client could starve , or be forced to wait indefinitely . )
Clearly , when one client has exclusive access to the resource , some or all other clients must wait idly and are unable to make progress .
( The worst case is when a client could starve , or be forced to wait indefinitely . )
Slowing progress ( fundamental ) : Sharing demands answers to expensive questions .
Beyond actual waiting , there is usually a cost for just asking for the coordination  whether or not it is actually needed .
.
Beyond actual waiting , there is usually a cost for just asking for the coordination  whether or not it is actually needed .
Wasting progress ( secondary ) : Resolving contention can mean throwing away work .
Additionally , some protocols perform optimistic execution to mitigate the first two costs and perform faster in the case of no contention .
But when contention actually happens , the protocol may have to undo and redo otherwise  useful work .
The more contention we encounter , the more effort we waste .
These penalties also manifest in various ways , shown in the columns .
The simplest case is when the potential cost is visible in our source code ( column A ) .
For example , just by looking at the code we know that the expression mutex.lock ( ) might cause our thread to wait idly .
But each penalty also manifests in invisible ways , both in software and in hardware ( columns B and C ) , particularly on multicore hardware .

Restaurants and patrons are reacting to a new bill that would make anyone getting an alcoholic drink scan their driver 's license .
The information would land in a state database .
The lunchtime crowd near 1400 South and Foothill Boulevard is relaxed , but some people are fired up about the new bill that would require anyone getting a drink of alcohol to scan their driver 's license .
John Burbidge says people should just show ID , not be put in a statewide database .
" I think they ought to do away with the private club business , and why do n't we normalize things a little bit , " he said .
But Josh Durrant sees the benefit of tracking how much alcohol people are consuming .
" Some of them might get a little carried away , and this way it would help limit it , " he said .
Some restaurants say they get a lot of business from alcohol sales , and this new bill may hurt that .
The president of the Utah Restaurant Association tells the Salt Lake Tribune she wants to meet with the bill 's sponsor , Senate President Michael Waddoups , to discuss it .
Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman says he 's against creating a statewide database that would track patrons ' visits to bars .
Huntsman says he 's in favor of scanning driver 's licenses to keep minors out of bars , but he says government should n't get into the business of keeping tabs on who drinks in the state .
Some lawmakers are considering creating a database as part of a compromise to eliminate the state 's private club system .

Do androids dream of electric penguins ?
In the decade since its founding in a Palo Alto garage , the name " Google " has become practically synonymous with the Internet .
Thus it was that the search company 's celebrated entry into the mobile market was met with significant enthusiasm from those who believed that Google would be able to use its immense resources and Internet savvy to produce a next - generation mobile product that would deliver " the cloud , " in its vast entirety , into the eager hands of consumers .
Some of the biggest names in the tech industry flocked to Google 's banner and affirmed their support for the Open Handset Alliance , which promised to liberate the mobile masses by building a blooming garden without walls .
After the fanfare faded , we ended up with Android — a platform that launched with some limitations but nonetheless has significant potential .
Although the first Android devices leave a lot to be desired when compared to competing products , the platform itself is evolving quickly , and it offers the advantages of openness and collaborative development .
In this article we 'll take a close look at the underlying technology of Android and what the platform means for developers .
Design philosophy
Although Android is built on top of the Linux kernel , the platform has very little in common with the conventional desktop Linux stack .
In fact , during a presentation at the Google IO conference , Google engineer Patrick Brady stated unambiguously that Android is not Linux .
Much of the Android userspace operates within the constraints of Dalvik , Google 's own custom Java virtual machine .
Dalvik uses its own bytecode format called Dex , and is not compatible with J2ME or other Java runtime environments .
Third - party Android applications are written in Java using Android 's official APIs and widget toolkit .
The Android SDK includes special compilation tools that will translate Java class files into Dex bytecode and generate an installation package that can be deployed on Android devices .
Android 's radically different approach to mobile Linux application development offers some unique advantages , but it also creates a lot of challenges for third - party developers .
The biggest advantage is that it provides a very high level of uniformity .
In theory , the vast majority of Android applications will be able to run seamlessly on virtually any Android - based device without requiring any further modification .
The problem with Google 's approach is that it makes Android an island .
The highly insular nature of the platform prevents Android users and developers from taking advantage of the rich ecosystem of existing third - party Linux applications .
Android does n't officially support native C programs at all , so it wo n't be possible to port your favorite GTK + or Qt applications to Android .
It 's also not possible to run existing MIDP applications on Android because it uses an incompatible virtual machine .
Other prominent mobile Linux platform initiatives have taken a very different approach and are making extensive use of existing desktop Linux technologies .
Maemo , OpenMoko , ALP , MOTOMAGX , Moblin , and Qt Extended all provide some kind of portability glide path between the desktop and other mobile platforms .
For example , it 's trivially easy to port an existing GTK + desktop application to Moblin , ALP , and Maemo devices .
The downside of the GTK + approach compared to Android is that the GTK + application will have to be modified to accommodate the hardware capabilities , form factor , and toolkit deviations for each individual device .
Android attempts to circumvent that problem by providing its own universal runtime and toolkit .
It is too early to judge whether Android 's approach is successful because the number of Android - based devices is still somewhat limited .
The SDK and API
Android supplies a comprehensive and well - organized assortment of high - level APIs for building applications and leveraging the underlying functionality of the platform .
The APIs provide an extremely high level of abstraction , which makes them relatively intuitive and easy to use .
Third - party applications can replicate or interface with virtually every major component of the platform .
For example , Android provides methods for retrieving information from the user 's contact list and for extending the contact system with new data fields .
It 's also easy to make a new dialer or implement custom behaviors for system events like incoming SMS messages .
This is one area in particular where I really feel like Google exceeded expectations and delivered on its promises :
The APIs truly make it possible to build applications that integrate fully with the rest of the platform .
The Android widget toolkit provides a lot of very useful components right out of the box .
The individual widgets are designed specifically for finger - friendly interaction , with features like kinetic scrolling already built in .
Developers use an XML - based user interface description language to specify the layout and attributes of the widgets , with the XML descriptions being loaded into the program through the Android resource system .
The individual widgets described in the XML layout can be referenced by ID in the program .
It 's also possible to create widgets programmatically and manipulate the user interface at runtime .
( CNN ) -- Donald Trump , businessman and CEO of The Trump Organization , knows a little something about money .
Donald Trump says President Obama is trying to solve the nation 's economic woes , but it's " trial and error . "
Trump spoke with CNN's Larry King about whether there should be executive pay limits , if there should be a stimulus plan and when there could be an end to the economic downturn .
The following is an edited portion of the interview .
Larry King :
Is Obama right or wrong to go after these executives with salary caps ?
Donald Trump :
Well , I think he 's absolutely right .
Billions of dollars is being given to banks and others .
You know , once you start using taxpayer money , it 's a whole new game .
So I absolutely think he 's right .
King :
What about the whole concept of bailouts ?
Trump :
Well , it 's a little bit different .
A lot of people are not in favor of bailouts .
You know , we talked about all the different things going on in this country .
Let 's face it , Larry , we are in a depression .
If they did n't do the bailout , you would be in depression No. 2 and maybe just as big as depression No. 1 , so they really had to do something .
The problem is they 're giving millions and billions of dollars to banks and the banks are n't loaning it .
If you are a prime customer of a bank and if you need 10 cents , you can't get it .
The banks are out of business .
They 're not loaning .
Now , billions of dollars has been given .
They 're supposed to be loaning out that money and they 're using it for other purposes , so it is a real mess .
King :
If you were in the Senate , would you vote for the stimulus plan ?
Trump :
Well , I 'd vote for a stimulus plan .
I 'm not sure that all of the things in there are appropriate .
Some of the little toys that they have are not really appropriate , and they 're a little surprising that they seem to want it , because the publicity on it has been terrible .
I would certainly vote for a stimulus , but I would really vote for banks having to loan out the money because they 're not doing that .
King :
In your adult career , have you ever seen it worse ?
Trump :
No , this is the worst ever .
This is the worst I 've ever seen .
1990 was a bad period of time , but this is far worse , and this is worse on a really global basis .
I 'm looking at different countries .
Every country is bad .
Now they 're blaming us because of what happened .
You know , why not blame the United States ?
But every country is in trouble .
King : Can you put the blame anywhere ?
Trump :
Well , look , it 's something that , to a certain extent , happens .
You go up , you go down .
You have recessions .
If you just look at the charts over the period of 150 years , you 've had good times ( and ) you 've had bad times .
Certainly , there 's been a lot of greed .
There 's been a lot of stupidity .
You know , like I say , today the banks do n't have money , they do n't loan money .
But if you went to a bank two years ago and you wanted a $ 300 million loan , they 'd say ' No , we do n't want to do that , but we 'll give you $ 400 million , ' so I guess , to a certain extent , that 's part of the problem .
King :
If you had the power , if you could wield , what would you do ?
Trump :
Well , the biggest problem we have is it 's trial and error , Larry .
I mean we 've never had anything like this before .
It is absolute trial and error .
They 're trying .
The new president is trying .
Bush left him with a mess -- a total mess in many different ways .
I really think he 's doing the best he can , but it is trial and error .
They try something , if it works , great .
If it does n't work -- and the problem is you do n't really know if it 's going to work for quite some time .
If it 's really wrong -- and it could be wrong -- we 're going to really have a mess in two years .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new national poll indicates that nearly three out of four Americans are scared about the way things are going in the country today .
A deputy oversees an eviction in Lafayette , Colorado , last week .
Seventy - three percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday say they 're very or somewhat scared about the way things are going in the United States .
That 's six points higher than in an October poll .
Nearly eight in 10 say things are going badly in the country , with just 21 percent suggesting that things are going well .
The survey also says that three out of four Americans are angry about the way things are going in the country .
But three out of four questioned say that things are going well for them personally .
The poll was released a day before President Obama gives a prime - time address before a joint session of Congress .
" Americans always believe things are better in their own lives than in the rest of the country , " said CNN polling director Keating Holland .
" But they are realists as well -- they recognize that bad times somewhere else in the U.S. may eventually come to affect them .
That 's why so many say they are angry and scared , even though they 're content with their own personal circumstances .
" There is a tiny sliver of good news -- the number of Americans who think things are going very badly has dropped from 40 percent in December to 32 percent now , " Holland added .
" But since most of those people switched from the very bad category to the pretty bad category , it 's wrong to say that the public is more optimistic -- call them a little less pessimistic at best . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday , with 1,046 adults questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

CHICAGO , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Insulin appears to shield the brain from toxic proteins associated with Alzheimer ’s disease , U.S. researchers said on Monday , supporting a theory that Alzheimer ’s may be a third form of diabetes .
And they said GlaxoSmithKline 's GSK.L diabetes drug Avandia , or rosiglitazone , which increases sensitivity to insulin , appeared to enhance this protective effect .
“ Our results demonstrate that bolstering insulin signaling can protect neurons from harm , ” William Klein of Northwestern University , whose study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , said in a statement .
Klein said the findings support a new idea that Alzheimer ’s is a type of diabetes of the brain .
“ In Type 1 diabetes , your pancreas is n’t making insulin .
In Type 2 diabetes , your tissues are insensitive to insulin because of problems in the insulin receptor .
Type 3 is where that insulin receptor problem is localized in the brain , ” Klein said in a telephone interview .
In some people , this can occur with age , he said .
“ As you get older , some individuals start to have less effective insulin signaling , including in the brain , ” he said , making the brain more vulnerable to toxins that cause Alzheimer ’s disease .
Large sticky plaques of amyloid beta protein are a hallmark of Alzheimer ’s , which causes memory loss , confusion , the inability to care for oneself and eventually death .
Recent studies by Klein and others have suggested that short strands of the protein , known as amyloid beta - derived diffusible ligands or ADDLs , attack memory - forming brain cells , causing memory loss .
Klein and colleagues treated rat nerve cells with insulin .
“ It blocked all of the effects of ADDLs , ” Klein said .
The effect was amplified when they added the drug rosiglitazone , which increases insulin sensitivity .
Several studies have found that diabetics have a higher risk of getting Alzheimer ’s than the general population .
Last July , researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York reported that diabetics who take insulin plus a diabetes pill have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer ’s than diabetics who only take insulin .
That study included a range of anti-diabetic medications , including an older pill known as a sulfonylurea .
Klein said the findings suggest that measures to protect people from diabetes -- including a healthy diet and exercise -- are also important for avoiding Alzheimer ’s disease .
In a separate study of more than 6,500 people , U.S. researchers found that having more education does little to slow progression of Alzheimer ’s disease once people show signs of becoming forgetful .
“ While education is associated with the memory ’s ability to function at a higher level , we found no link between higher education and how fast the memory loses that ability , ” said Robert Wilson of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago , whose study appears in the journal Neurology .
Alzheimer ’s affects 5.2 million people in the United States and 26 million globally , according to the Alzheimer ’s Association .

The cellphone is the world ’s most ubiquitous computer .
The four billion cellphones in use around the globe carry personal information , provide access to the Web and are being used more and more to navigate the real world .
And as cellphones change how we live , computer scientists say , they are also changing how we think about information .
It has been 25 years since the desktop , with its files and folders , was introduced as a way to think about what went on inside a personal computer .
The World Wide Web brought other ways of imagining the flow of data .
With the dominance of the cellphone , a new metaphor is emerging for how we organize , find and use information .
New in one sense , that is .
It is also as ancient as humanity itself .
That metaphor is the map .
“ The map underlies man ’s ability to perceive , ” said Richard Saul Wurman , a graphic designer who was a pioneer in the use of maps as a generalized way to search for information of all kinds before the emergence of the online world .
As this metaphor takes over , it will change the way we behave , the way we think and the way we find our way around new neighborhoods .
As researchers and businesses learn how to use all the information about a user ’s location that phones can provide , new privacy issues will emerge .
You may use your phone to find friends and restaurants , but somebody else may be using your phone to find you and find out about you .
ZURICH / GENEVA ( Reuters ) - UBS UBSN .VXUBS .N shares hit record lows on Friday as Swiss bank stocks reeled on concern a widening U.S. tax probe will weaken the strict privacy rules that underpin Switzerland 's wealth management industry .
UBS led the fall in Swiss bank shares .
It closed down 14 percent after hitting a new all - time low at 10.54 Swiss francs .
The shares of rivals Credit Suisse CSGN.VX and Julius Baer BAER .VX , both large players in the private banking industry that has thrived thanks to Swiss bank privacy laws , were down 6 percent and 7 percent , respectively .
The DJ Stoxx index of European banks . SX7P was down 6 percent .
The bank worries also hit the Swiss franc .
Crisis - hit UBS settled late on Wednesday U.S. criminal charges it had helped rich Americans dodge their taxes .
But U.S. tax authorities said on Thursday they were still pursuing a civil lawsuit seeking to access details on 52,000 UBS clients .
“ It is very unfair to see that the whole profession has been dragged through the mud , ” Ivan Pictet , senior managing partner and scion of one of Switzerland ’s largest private banks , said in an interview with the Geneva daily Le Temps .
“ The reputation of the whole ( Swiss ) financial centre has been tarnished by the fault of a single banking institution .
It is a very annoying precedent for Switzerland . ”
Despite tough Swiss laws protecting bank clients , the government said on Thursday it had no choice but let UBS hand over data to avoid U.S. criminal charges that could have threatened the bank ’s existence and hurt the Swiss economy , which is heavily dependent on the banking industry .
It was unprecedented that the data was handed over before a Swiss administrative court had the chance to say whether any fraud was committed and a judgement issued on Friday said the financial regulator was not allowed to hand over the documents .
The judgement , by Switzerland ’s Federal Administrative Court , said the financial regulator could not hand over details on bank clients to third parties , in particular to U.S. authorities .
UBS agreed on Wednesday to pay a fine of $ 780 million ( 540 million pounds ) and to disclose about 250 names of U.S. clients it said had committed tax fraud .
But U.S. tax authorities now want the names of thousands of citizens it says are hiding about $ 14.8 billion in assets in secret Swiss bank accounts .
“ The Swiss made a mistake , they believed that in caving in ... that things would come to an end , ” Douglas Hornung , a Geneva lawyer who represents American clients of UBS under U.S. investigation , told Reuters .
“ They have now discovered with shock that it continues and the whole Swiss financial centre is in danger . ”

PRESSURE MOUNTS
Nearly a third of the wealth that is stashed in tax havens around the world is in Swiss banks -- an estimated $ 2.2 trillion -- making the country the world ’s biggest offshore centre .
Other havens include Liechtenstein , Bermuda and Singapore .
Tax - dodging schemes are increasingly under attack by governments scrambling to find revenue to finance the soaring costs of government stimulus programmes .
John Christensen , director of the Tax Justice Network , which campaigns against bank secrecy , said he also saw a dramatic shift in public opinion against tax havens .
“ It is clear to many that the game is over ; the game pretending this is a minor issue , ” he said .
“ Wealth management has become an euphemism for tax evasion . ”
The issue will be on the agenda at a meeting of European leaders in Berlin at the weekend to prepare for the April G20 summit on reforming global financial rules .
The German government said on Friday it had taken note of the UBS settlement and said it will continue to push for the implementation of international standards on tax evasion .
Germany , which paid an informant last year to obtain the names of German clients hiding funds in LGT bank of Liechtenstein , is now investigating Prince Max of Liechtenstein for possible tax evasion , the Financial Times Deutschland reported on Friday .
LGT said in a statement that Prince Max , the bank ’s CEO who lives in Munich and is the second son of current ruler Hans Adam II , had complied with Germany tax rules and was cooperating with authorities in the investigation .
Switzerland ’s European Union neighbours are also watching the development of the UBS case and are hoping cooperation with the U.S. authorities will set a precedent .
“ I would expect that similar requests from EU member states would by no means be treated differently , ” said a spokeswoman for EU Tax Commissioner Laszlo Kovacs .
Kenneth Farrugia , General Manager of Valetta Fund Services in Malta , which caters to onshore and offshore clients , said the U.S. investigation had ramifications far beyond UBS .
“ UBS is not reliant on investors from the U.S. , or even on private banking .
The stability of UBS is not in question , ” he said .
“ The question is how will this affect U.S. customers of other Swiss banks ? ”
UBS shares rallied on Thursday on hopes the settlement would end uncertainty hanging over the company .
UBS has written down more toxic assets than any other European bank during the credit crisis , prompting clients to loose confidence and withdraw billions of dollars .

It 's the holiday season , and the American Psychological Association tells me that I , as a woman , am more likely than my husband to be stressed about buying holiday gifts for our three kids .
According to their survey released this week , about 46 percent of women are worried about having enough money to buy gifts compared with 35 percent of men .
That goes along with the fact that women are more stressed than men over the economy in general , as I previously blogged about .
LISTEN NOW :
Why Women Are Prone to Holiday Stress Subscribe to Health Check
Another new finding suggests that I , as a woman , am more prone to heart disease if I 'm raising kids or caring for an elderly parent who lives in my home .
The study , published today in the journal Heart , was pretty shocking : Married women ages 40 to 59 who lived with children had twice the risk of developing heart disease as single women or those living only with their spouses .
Adding an elderly parent to the mix tripled a woman 's heart attack risk .
Men , on the other hand , had no such increase in heart disease risk if they lived with kids , parents , or , heck , even their in - laws .
( Caveat :
The folks in the study were Japanese , and it's possible that American men are more stressed than their Japanese counterparts over family responsibilities . )
The culprit ?
The researchers speculate that the stress of filling multiple roles as wife , mother , and caregiver boosts stress hormones .
That , in turn , could increase women 's blood pressure and make their bodies generate inflammatory chemicals that lead to other heart disease risk factors like diabetes and clogged arteries .
So I 'm guessing that the additive effect of economic woes , multiple role demands , and worry over too much to do in the countdown to Christmas , Kwanzaa , or Chanukah may have many of us on the verge of a nervous breakdown .
What to do ?
Psychologist Lynn Bufka , assistant executive director of the American Psychological Association , recommends these three tips .
1 . Think memory instead of money :
If coveted holiday gifts are out of your budget , think about creating a family memory instead of giving an expensive present .
Kids usually value the time you spend with them — whether it 's baking cookies , throwing snowballs , or driving around to see holiday lights — far more than the gift that loses its luster soon after the wrapping is torn away .
2. Reset your expectations : Maybe you can't create the same holiday your mom had .
" You may be at home far less than your mother was , " says Bufka .
And that means less time to string up lights or wrap all the presents with perfect bows .
" You may need to reinvent those time - consuming traditions , " she adds .
Or maybe create some new ones of your own .
3 . Get your loved ones to cut you some slack :
That 's probably one of the hardest things to do , especially when you 're getting pressured from , say , children who expect the kinds of presents that their friends get or a spouse whose mom set the bar high for holiday festivities .
" Talk to them about what 's realistically possible , " says Bufka .
And help them understand what 's actually required to fulfill their expectations .
Your kids want that $ 200 Wii ?
Have them shovel the neighbors ' driveways to see how much money they earn in a few hours .
Husband wants the five - course dinner with all the trimmings ?
Give him a supermarket shopping list and a few dishes to make on his own .
History abounds with examples of dramatic social change occurring when a disadvantaged group finally stands up and says " Enough ! " .
By recognizing their inequalities , members of disadvantaged groups can mobilize and attempt to bring about change .
Traditional methods of improving relations between different racial and ethnic groups have focused on creating harmony between those groups .
For example , " contact theory " proposes that bringing members of opposing groups together by emphasizing the things they have in common can achieve harmony by increasing positive feelings towards the other group .
However , research has shown that positive contact not only changes attitudes , but can also make disadvantaged group members less aware of the inequality in power and resources between the groups .
Is it possible that there can be too much of a good thing ?
Psychologist Tamar Saguy from Yale University , along with her colleagues Nicole Tausch ( Cardiff University ) , John Dovidio ( Yale University ) and Felicia Pratto ( University of Connecticut ) examined the negative effects of positive contact between groups , first in the laboratory and then in the real world .
In the first experiment , students were divided into either advantaged or disadvantaged groups , with the advantaged groups in charge of distributing course credits at the end of the experiment .
Before the course credits were doled out , members of the groups interacted , with instructions to focus on either the similarities or differences between the two groups .
The results , described in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , revealed that following the similarity - focused interactions , members of the disadvantaged group had increased expectations that the advantaged group members would fairly distribute the course credits .
These expectations were the result of overall improved attitudes towards the advantaged group and reduced attention of the disadvantaged group members to the inequalities between the groups .
However , these expectations proved to be unrealistic - the advantaged group discriminated against the disadvantaged group when handing out course credits , regardless of the type of conversations they had engaged in at the start of the experiment .
The psychologists next wanted to see if this effect occurs in the real world .
They surveyed Israeli - Arabs ( a disadvantaged minority group ) about their attitudes towards Jews .
As in the previous experiment , more positive contact ( assessed by the number of Jewish friends the Israeli - Arabs had ) resulted in improved attitudes towards Jews and increased perceptions of Jews as fair towards Arabs .
In addition , although in general Israeli - Arabs are strongly motivated towards social change and greater equality , positive contact with Jews was related to a decreased support for change .
The results of the two studies suggest that positive contact with majority groups may result in disadvantaged groups being less likely to support social change - with improved attitudes towards the advantaged groups and reduced attention to social inequality , the disadvantaged groups may become less motivated to promote change .
These findings have important implications , not just for global diplomacy , but also in our everyday encounters .
The authors note that positive contact between groups does not necessarily have to undermine efforts towards equality .
Rather , they suggest that " encounters that emphasize both common connections and the problem of unjust group inequalities may promote intergroup understanding as well as recognition of the need for change . "
The authors conclude that such mixed - content encounters can bring members of all groups together and " perhaps motivate them to eliminate social inequalities . "

The Toronto Real Estate Board yesterday reported a meagre 888 sales in the first half of January , compared with 1,776 sales during the same period a year ago .
The average price of a home is also down , 9.5 per cent to $ 332,495 , compared with last year 's $ 367,574 – a $ 35,000 plunge .
" The economic situation in Canada has changed noticeably over the past year ... Toronto is not immune to this , " TREB president Maureen O'Neill said .
" The GTA housing market has been impacted . "
Realtors say a flurry of buying last January to escape Toronto's new land transfer tax that came into effect in February 2008 may have exaggerated the year - over - year drop .
Sales in the city of Toronto are off 54 per cent in the first 15 days of 2009 , while prices are down more than $ 40,000 for the average home .
Homes in the 905 suburbs were not hit as hard , with sales down 47 per cent and prices off $ 26,000 .
There is no question this will be a difficult year for the housing market as well as the commercial real estate market .
Job losses for the GTA could mount to 125,000 over the next 12 to 18 months , according to a report by housing analyst Will Dunning .
" We are probably at the edge of a rapid drop in employment , " Dunning said .
" That added negative factor will accelerate , deepen and prolong the recession . "
Dunning said he remains convinced the condo market is the most vulnerable to a downturn , with 36,700 units currently under construction in the GTA .
In central Toronto , resale listings , as well as rental condo listings , are up 75 per cent from a year ago , he said .
" I 've been saying for a long time that there is excess investment in the condo apartment market and the reckoning has been deferred due to delayed completions , " Dunning said .
" This has allowed the supply pipeline to get very fat .
The reckoning has now begun . "
Meanwhile , in the commercial market , there was just under 12 million square feet leased in 2008 , compared with 13 million in 2007 , resulting in an 8 per cent drop in activity according to a report on commercial and industrial activity released by TREB yesterday .
" This result demonstrates the commercial market has not escaped the downward economic pressures of the last several quarters , " said TREB commercial council chair Garry Lander .

Despite the fall , 2008 leasing figures are still up by 3 per cent over 2006 figures .
But analysts say it will be tougher for commercial real estate as layoffs start to sink in , while more than three million square feet of new space is set to be completed at the end of 2009 .

India 's vegetable oil imports surged by 17 per cent crossing 10 million tonnes mark in the 2011 - 12 marketing year that ended last month on strong domestic demand as per industry body Solvent Extractors Association of India ( SEA ) .
The country had imported a total of 8.7 million tonnes of vegetable oil comprising both edible and non-edible oils in the 2010 - 11 marketing year ( November - October ) .
The total import of edible oil during November 2011 to October 2012 is reported at 99.81 lakh tonnes , doubled in six years .
According to Solvent Extractors Association of India ( SEA ) , " Local consumption increased by up to 8,00,000 tonnes due to a rise in per capita consumption and population growth .
Lower price of vegetable oils also boosted consumption during the year . "
Click here for full report
The overall import of vegetableoil has increased by 15.2 lakh tonnes ( 17.5 % ) during oil year 2011 - 12 ( Nov. - Oct ) over the previous year .
The main reasons for increase in import of vegetable oil are :
i) The overall production of veg . oils was down by about 7.0 lakh tonnes due to reduced oilseed crop during 2011 - 12 ,
ii ) Local consumption increased by about 7.5 to 8.0 lakh tonnes due to increase in per capita consumption ( 3 % ) and population growth ( 1.76 % ) .
Also lower price of veg. oils boost the consumption of veg. oils during the year .
iii ) Closing stock of imported veg. oils as on 31st October increased by 2.60 lakh tonnes to 15.70 lakh tonnes .
iv ) Malaysia and Indonesia pushed the palm oil export into India during the year to reduce their excessive stock burden .
v ) Due to inverted export duty structure by Indonesia , import of RBD Palmolein substantially increased during the year .
vi )
The overall consumption increased by about 12.5 lakh tonnes , leading to higher import during the year
Current stock of edible oils as on 1st November , 2012 at various ports is estimated at 920,000 tonnes ( CPO 600,000 tonnes , RBD Palmolein 95,000 tonnes , Degummed Soybean Oil 125,000 tonnes , Crude Sunflower Oil 85,000 tonnes and Canola Rape Oil 15,000 tonnes ) and about 650,000 tonnes in pipelines .
Closing stock increased by 2.60 lakh tonnes at the end of the year and reported at 15.70 lakh tonnes .
During Oil Year 2011 - 12 ( Nov - Oct )
Palm
Oil import increased to 76.69 lakh tonnes compared to 65.47 lakh tonnes during the last year and the same time soft oil import also increased to 23.12 lakh tonnes , consisting of 10.79 lakh tonnes of soybean oil , 11.35 lakh tonnes of sunflower oil , 0.91 lakh tonnes of rape oil and 0.07 lakh tonnes of other soft oils compared to 18.24 lakh tonnes during the same period of last year .
The end of the cash nexus
Tyler Cowen has a short post which covers a number of themes I ’ve been going on about for ages , though never with a fully satisfactory analysis .
He starts by pointing to work by Michael Mandel suggesting that much of the measured productivity growth in the US has been bogus ( see also Matt Yglesias on this ) .
I agree , particularly as regards the financial sector .
More interestingly , Cowen goes on to note that
there was some productivity growth but much of it fell outside of the usual cash and revenue - generating nexus .
Maybe you will live until 83 rather than 81.5 and your pain reliever will work better .
In the meantime you will read blogs and gaze upon beautiful people using your Facebook account .
Those are gains to consumer surplus , but they do n’t prop up the revenue - generating sectors of the economy as one might have expected .
I agree and I think the implications are profound , if still hard to predict with any accuracy .
There has been a huge shift in the location of innovation , with much of it either deriving from , or dependent on , public goods produced outside the market and government sectors , which may be referred to as social production .
Some suggestions , not fully argued , over the fold
* If monetary returns are weakly , or even negatively correlated with the value of social production , there ’s no reason to expect capital markets to do a good job in allocating resources to supporting innovation .
( This point seems rather less controversial than when I made it in 2006 . )
* As a corollary , it seems unlikely that large inequalities in income are beneficial to anyone except the recipients of high incomes ( this issue is being discussed , in a much more abstract setting , at Crooked Timber )
* If improvements in welfare are increasingly independent of the market , it would make sense to shift resources out of market production , for example by reducing working hours .
The financial crisis seems certain to produce at least a temporary drop in average hours , but the experience of the Depression and the Japanese slowdown of the 1990s suggest that the effect may be permanent
* Creativity , broadly defined , seems likely to become more important , while markets , particularly financial markets , become less so .
Firms that want to survive and prosper will have to behave quite differently from the way the did in the past .
Google is an obvious example of a firm that is trying to do this , if not always succeeding .
Python Programming , news on the Voidspace Python Projects and all things techie .
itemgetter and attrgetter
I 've just discovered the attrgetter and itemgetter functions from the Python standard library operator module ( both functions new in Python 2.4 with added functionality in Python 2.5 ) .
I wish I 'd discovered them earlier as although they do very simple jobs they can make code cleaner and more readable .
Both of them return functions that will fetch a specified item or attribute from objects .
One place I could make use of attrgetter is in property definitions .
It is a fairly common pattern to have a property with custom behaviour when set , but that merely returns an underlying instance attribute when fetched .
As an example :
class Model ( object ) :
def __init_ ( self ) :
self .
_document = None
def _set_document ( self , document ) :
self .
_document = document
document = property ( lambda self : self .
_document , _set_document )
The ' document ' setter method is _set_document , but the getter is merely a lambda that returns self .
_document .
We can improve this by using attrgetter instead :
from operator import attrgetter
. . .
document = property ( attrgetter ( ' _document ' ) , _set_document )
attrgetter is called with a string and returns a function that fetches that attribute .
Anything that helps eliminate lambdas has to be good right ?
It is roughly the equivalent of :
def attrgetter ( attribute ) :
def getter ( thing ) :
return getattr ( thing , attribute )
return getter
In Python 2.5 you can call attrgetter with multiple attributes and the getter it returns will fetch you a tuple of all the attributes .
As an added bonus , if you are using CPython , it is nice and fast .
itemgetter is very similar , but instead of fetching attributes it fetches items from sequences or mappings .
One place this comes in handy is as a key function when sorting lists .
A common pattern when needing a custom sort order for lists is ' decorate - sort - undecorate ' ( also known as the Schwartzian Transform from its Perl origin ) .
This involves transforming the list ( decorate ) into one that can be sorted using the built - in sorted ( which returns a new list ) or using the list sort method ( which sorts in place ) .
You then transform your newly sorted list back ( the undecorate ) .
This pattern is now built - in to Python .
Both sorted and sort take a key function to transform each item .
The list is sorted on the transformed items , saving you the effort of having to do it yourself .
As an example suppose we have a list of tuples like ( first_name , last_name ) , and we want to sort on last name .
We can achieve this by passing in a key function to sort that returns the second item of the tuple :
items = [ ( ' Michael ' , ' Foord ' ) , ( ' Menno ' , ' Smits ' ) , ( ' Christian ' , ' Muirhead ' ) , ( ' Jonathan ' , ' Hartley ' ) ]
sorted_items = sorted ( items , key = lambda item : item [ 1 ] )
I 'm sure you can see what 's coming .
We can use itemgetter to eliminate the lambda :
from operator import itemgetter
. . .
sorted_items = sorted ( items , key = itemgetter ( 1 ) )
itemgetter is roughly the equivalent of :
def itemgetter ( item ) :
def getter ( thing ) :
return thing [ item ]
return getter
As with attrgetter it is nice and fast and the Python 2.5 version can take multiple items and the getter will then return you a tuple .
It does n't just work with sequences , but can also be used with dictionaries .
I actually discovered this when Christian was playing with Raymond Hettinger 's Named Tuple Recipe ( one of awesomenesses coming in Python 2.6 ) on IronPython .
Its use of itemgetter triggered a very obscure bug in IronPython 2 Beta 4 that has thankfully gone away with the Beta 5 release .
Named tuples really are awesome , and we will start using them in Resolver One .
Python : Two Phase Object Creation
I 've started watching a talk by Alex Martelli on Python and design patterns :
It 's very interesting .
Alex points out that design patterns can't be taken out of the context of the language ( the technology ) in which they are being used .
For example , the iterator pattern is now built - in to most high - level languages .
With first class types and functions , most of the object creational patterns are effectively built - in to Python ( class and function factories are trivially easy to write ) .
I 'm only half way through the video , but I liked his explanation of object creation in Python .
Python has two different ' magic - methods ' ( protocol methods ) for object construction , and it is probably not until you have programming in Python for a while ( become a ' journeyman ' ) that you need to understand this .
The method usually described as the ' constructor ' is __init__ .
If you define a class with a ' dunder - init ' method , then it is called when a new object is created :
class SomeClass ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self , * args , ** keywargs )
. . .
When you create an instance - SomeClass ( *args , ** keywargs ) - the arguments you use in the call are passed to the __init__ method .
Notice that __init__ is an instance method - it receives the instance self as the first argument .
This means that it is really an object initialiser ; the instance has already been created when it is called .
The method responsible for creating objects is a class method called __new__ .
This receives the class as the first argument and should return an instance :
class SomeClass ( object ) :
def __new__ ( cls , * args , ** keywargs )
. . .
return object .
__new__ ( cls )
dunder - new can actually return anything ; there is no restriction requiring it to be an instance of the class .
It can return an instance of a sub-class picked by the arguments passed in , it can return None or a pre-created instance ( useful for the Singleton pattern ) .
If dunder - new does return an instance of the class then dunder - init is called with the same arguments that were passed to dunder - new - the arguments used in the call to construct the object .
The vast majority of classes you write wo n't need a custom implementation of dunder - new .
So when might you want to use __new__ ?
We 've already mentioned using your class as a factory that can return an instance of a subclass .
Another reason is for creating immutable objects .
Because dunder - init is an instance method it can be called again on an instance .
If object state is setup in dunder - init then calling it again with new arguments could change the state of the object :
instance = SomeClass ( * args , ** keywargs )
instance .
__init__ ( * newargs , ** newkeywargs )
If you setup the object state in dunder - new instead then calling it again creates a new instance rather than mutating the instance .
You 'll need to do this if you sub-class the built - in immutable types like strings , numbers or tuples .
Even if you only want to write a new dunder - init method that takes new arguments , you will still need to override dunder - new .
Any arguments passed to object creation will also get passed to dunder - new ; and the default one will barf on extra arguments .
class MyInt ( int ) :
def __new__ ( cls , value , arg ) :
return int .
__new__ ( cls , value )
def __init__ ( self , value , arg ) :
self .
arg = arg
Creating instances from classes is actually done by the metaclass ( yes - they are in the language for a reason other than making things complicated ) .
You can make objects callable in Python by defining a __call__ method .
If a class defines dunder - call , then instances of the class are callable .
In fact functions and methods in Python are just examples of callable objects .
Object creation is done by ' calling classes ' .
So if calling an object results in a call to dunder - call defined on their class , what happens when you call a class ?
The same thing ... the class of a class is its metaclass - and when you call a class , __call__ on the metaclass is called .
For classes that inherit from object ( new - style classes ) , the default metaclass is type .
The two phase object construction we have been discussing is implemented in type .
__call__ , and it is roughly equivalent to :
def __call__ ( cls , * args , ** keywargs ) :
instance = cls .
__new__ ( cls , * args , ** keywargs )
if isinstance ( instance , cls ) :
cls .
__init__ ( instance , * args , ** keywargs )
return instance
So you can customize what happens when a class is ' called ' by implementing a custom metaclass that overrides __call__ .

Important note for all your podcast - fans .
We will be doing the live - stream sometime around 11 AM EST this morning .
I have a family obligation , which has bumped up the podcast time .
No worries , news updates will continue on their weekend schedule as usual .
If I did n’t tell you that I had family obligations , you would have never noticed a difference !
Once again , live - stream podcast sometime around 11 PM EST .
We hope to see you in the IRC !
I ’m off to bed for the night , gang .
Thanks for letting me slip out on a Friday night .
I hope you were out and about doing much more fun things than sitting at a computer !
See you all in a few , short hours .
I ca n’t think of a better way to kick off a weekend .
This is one of the most heart - warming stories I ’ve heard in awhile .
Reader PsyduckWarrior and his family were involved in quite a horrible event .
While the first part of the story is far from happy , it ends with a bit of a bright spot , thanks to Nintendo .
Instead of summarizing the story , I thought I ’d let PsyduckWarrior tell it in his own words .
I am a 21 year old Junior in college and as part of my Sports Administration courses , I had to intern as a coach at a local high school .
I chose to go home to the high school I graduated from and I moved in with my parents so that I could save a little cash .
On September 19th , while my parents and I were at work , our house caught fire .
By the end of the day , we had lost everything we owned , save what ever we had in our vehicles .
The most important thing was that no one in my family was hurt except for a couple of pets ( I lost my pet scorpion and my parents lost their cat ) .
In the days that followed , we had to make inventories of everything we lost .
We did n’t have insurance so this was merely so we could find out exactly what we lost and what we could replace in the short term .
My list , when it was done , included more than 250 Nintendo games spanning all their consoles , every Nintendo console , almost all accessories , every Gameboy iteration , a DS … I had a lot of Nintendo stuff … including a working Virtual Boy and a Gameboy Light ( a Japanese Gameboy Pocket with a backlight ) .
My collection was n’t very extensive but it had some things that most people would n’t .
My mom also owned a Wii and a DS and a few games , which were lost as well ( in fact , the fire was so hot in the living room that there was no trace of her gaming stuff … it had been completely melted and just dissipated ) .
As time went on , our community helped us out so much by giving us a place to stay , money , clothes , and food .
About a month ago , I contacted Nintendo to ask about what I should do about the Wiiware account my Wii had on it and how I should go about suspending it for when I get a new one .
Included in the letter were pictures of some of my gaming stuff I could salvage from the rubble as part of a morbid curiosity thing ( ever want to see what a melted Wii looks like ?
So did many of my friends ) .
About two weeks later , I received a call from Nintendo ’s Customer Service Department .
They had received my packet and wanted to find out how my family and I were getting along .
I told them about what had happened and how we were doing .
Then , they offered me to replace my Wii and my Gameboy Advance SP for free .
They even threw in all the cords for the Wii and the charger and such for the SP !
I was blown away that the company would want to know how my family was doing let alone want to help out .
I sent off my old , melted Wii and SP and received my new ones .
In the past Nintendo has been helpful to me when I had a problem with a console , but this above and beyond anything I expected .
It is n’t everything my family and I had , but it helps a little bit to getting our lives back to ‘ normal ’ .

Since Infobarrel .com features nearly a thousand how to articles and how to guides , I figured it would probably be a good idea to go over the basics on how to write a successful how to guide .
1. The Topic
2. Opening Paragraph
3. Materials Required
4. Warnings / Tips
5.Numbered Steps
6. References / Resources
7. Conclusion
The first thing you should do when writing a how to guide , is decide what topic you want to write about .
Try to write about topics you know people will search for , this will increase your chance of your article getting natural traffic from Google .
Also , try to make your topic similar to what you would type in when looking something up in Google .
If you are writing a guide that teaches you how to brush your teeth , your title should be ' How to Brush your Teeth ' .
Next , you will want to create your opening paragraph .
The opening paragraph should be clear and concise and tell the reader exactly what your how to article should help them accomplish .
In this paragraph you should set the reader 's expectations .
Make sure you do n't promise them the world if your guide can't deliver .
In order to not waste your reader 's time , the next paragraph should outline all the materials needed to perform your guide .
It is annoying for the reader if they get half way through your guide and realize they do n't have something needed to complete the project because you forgot to list it .
If there is anything hazardous about performing your guide , you should give your reader a heads up in the paragraph following the required materials .
This is also a great place to outline a few basic tips or things to look out for while following your guide .
Next is the meat and potatoes of your article ; the steps .
Outline each step with a number to make your guide easier to follow .
Make each step short and easy to understand .
Do n't assume the reader has any background in what they are doing and cover every last tiny step .
If you have taken information from books , websites or other sources , make sure you credit them before the article is complete .
References are always great to support any arguments from reader 's who disagree with your methods .
Finally , wrap your how to article up with a conclusion that talks about the final product .
There should be no confusion about what the reader just accomplished ; they should leave with a solid understanding of whatever it was you were trying to teach .
That is it folks !
Stick to these simple steps and your how to articles and how to guides will be helpful and provide value to the reader .

Its Legislature has only one chamber — a Senate — and senators do n't use party labels .
The state now has another distinction :
It is the only state that does n't subsidize the medical care of retired government employees .
MEDICAL BENEFITS : Benefits neglected for civil retirees " We bring up the issue of retiree medical care , and it goes nowhere , " says Mike Marvin , executive director of the Nebraska Association of Public Employees , a union .
" Heck , we can't even get decent wages . "
Nebraska is the only state in the country that owes nothing for the medical care of retired government workers .
The other 49 states have an unfunded obligation of $ 445 billion , according to a USA TODAY survey .
New accounting rules require that states and local governments report how much they owe for medical benefits promised to workers after they retire .
This previously unreported obligation is the third leg of a stool — along with debt and pension liability — that accountants use to compute the financial health of a government .
Some state governments take financial responsibility for the medical insurance of retired teachers and local police officers .
Elsewhere , school districts and cities pay the bill .
So the same $ 25 billion liability can fall on a state legislature or be sprinkled around hundreds of towns , school districts , water authorities and other agencies .
The USA has 89,437 branches of local government , according to the Census Bureau .
A USA TODAY survey of 25 midsize to large governments found a retiree medical obligation of $ 126 billion .
Similar places vary : • Big — New York City has a $ 60 billion obligation , more than its $ 43 billion in debt .
• Small — Los Angeles has a tab of $ 544 million .
• Big —
The University of Texas and the Texas A&M systems have a combined $ 7 billion obligation .
• Small — The University of Colorado and Colorado State have a $ 274 million tab .
A few state and local governments have started to set aside money to prepare for paying retiree medical costs .
Others have been cautious because of the expense and legal issues .
The value of these benefits varies enormously between governments .
Some pay nearly all the cost .
Others contribute a fixed amount , such as $ 200 a month or 50 % of the health insurance premium .
Even seemingly modest benefits can be costly because police officers , teachers and other civil servants often retire many years before qualifying for Medicare at 65 .
" People are going to ask , ' Why does this place have higher taxes ? ' or ' Why does this place have high water rates ? ' " says Kenneth Rust , president of the Government Finance Officers Association .
The reason will be retiree medical costs , he says .
Florida requires local governments to let retirees buy the same medical insurance provided to current workers .
This can cost governments more than $ 5,000 annually per retiree , even when retirees pay 100 % of the premium , because retirees use more medical care , driving up costs .
Actuary Becky Sielman of Milliman Inc. , a benefits consultant , says the obligation among 35 governments her firm works with in New England ranges from $ 3,000 to $ 95,000 per worker and retiree .
That amount reflects the money needed today , set aside and earning money , like a pension fund , to produce enough income to cover medical benefits after workers retire .
A few governments have resisted reporting their numbers .
" There 's no legal requirement in Texas to pay these health benefits .
For that reason , it 's misleading to report them as a liability , " says Suzy Whittenton , state director of fiscal management .
University of Texas accounting professor Michael Granof disagrees .
" The liability exists , whether you report it or not .
The new surgeon general can't solve illness in America by recalibrating the thermometer , " he says .
Although Texas does n't report the number in its financial report , it has calculated the total obligation , including its universities : $ 48.7 billion , second biggest among states .
By contrast , Nebraska reports no liability .
" Nebraska is a fiscally conservative , pay - as - you - go state , and that 's the biggest reason we do n't have this benefit , " says state Sen .
Dave Pankonin , chairman of the Legislature 's retirement systems committee .
" Private sector employees rarely have this benefit , " says Pankonin , a farm equipment dealer .
" The era of early retirement before Social Security age and Medicare is becoming unrealistic . "
Nebraska shuns all long - term financial commitments , not just for retirement benefits .
The state has no debt .
Its Constitution forbids it .
One thing Nebraska does have : A balanced $ 3.5 billion budget and a $ 563 million cash reserve .

The day that robot playmates help children with autism learn the social skills that they naturally lack has come a step closer with the development of a system that allows a robot to monitor a child ’s emotional state .
“ There is a lot of research going on around the world today trying to use robots to treat children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) .
It has shown that the children are attracted to robots , raising the promise that appropriately designed robots could play an important role in their treatment , ” says Nilanjan Sarkar , associate professor of mechanical engineering at Vanderbilt University .
“ However , the efforts so far have been quite limited because they have n’t had a way to monitor the emotional state of the children , which would allow the robot to respond automatically to their reactions . ”
If these limitations can be overcome , the use of robots to treat children with ASD could have a significant social and financial impact .
One baby in every 150 born today in the United States is diagnosed with ASD , making it more common than pediatric cancer , diabetes and AIDS combined .
Currently , treatment of these children involves a combination of behavioral , educational , physical , occupational and speech therapies , sometimes accompanied by medication for co-occurring conditions such as anxiety , irritability , bi-polar and other disorders .
The average cost of caring for one person with autism for life is $ 3.2 million .
In total , autism currently costs the U.S. more than $ 90 billion per year , and that cost is projected to double by 2017 due to the growing population of those affected .
Over the last five years , Sarkar has developed a method that uses physiological measurements , including heart rate , galvanic skin response , temperature and muscle response , to monitor the emotional state of individuals .
His original motivation was to improve human - robot interactions .
When his nephew was diagnosed with autism , however , Sarkar got the idea of applying the technique to aid children with ASD .
So he sought out one of the leading authorities on the subject , Wendy Stone , professor of pediatrics and investigator at Vanderbilt ’s Kennedy Center , and they formed a partnership to develop this new approach .
“ I ’m always interested in creative ways to study and treat autism , so , when Nilanjan approached me , I was willing to listen , ” says Stone .
“ He had clearly done his homework and his proposal sounded like a great idea . ”
This fall , Sarkar and Stone published two papers – one in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics and one in the International Journal of Human - Computer Studies – that describe the results of their first set of experiments , which were conducted with six children ranging in age from 13 to 16 years who had been diagnosed with ASD .
A battery of physiological sensors were attached to the participants and they were asked to play two games .
One was the computer game Pong .
The other was a variant of Nerf basketball with the hoop and backboard attached to the end of a robotic arm that moves it back and forth or up and down .
Graduate students Changchun Liu and Karla Conn participated in the studies .
The researchers report that the physiological data they gathered can be used to develop an affective model for each individual that can predict his or her emotional states of liking , anxiety and engagement with an accuracy of better than 80 percent .
Furthermore , they showed that this information can be used in real time to alter the game configuration in ways that significantly increase the children ’s degree of engagement .
“ That ’s the part that really nailed me , ” says Stone , “ that the robot can read the physiological cues of the person playing the game , control the distance and angle of the hoop , and that the person reported a more positive mood when the computer was responsive to his needs . ”
The ability to accurately monitor a child ’s emotional state is particularly important in treating ASD , Stone says : “ Children with autism are not necessarily giving the kind of emotional cues that we know how to read .
They are not necessarily good reporters of their inner feelings .
If we know that the child is becoming upset or anxious , then we can help the child identify his or her own emotional state and implement strategies for monitoring and control .
It is a concrete way to help them identify their own feelings . ”
One of the most encouraging results of their preliminary research was discovering that the affective model works accurately in different settings .
The model was based on the readings they took as the children played Pong .
The game was changed in several ways : Ball and paddle speeds were varied , and computer - based opponents of different skill levels were introduced .
This allowed the researchers to induce emotions of interest , boredom , anxiety and engagement in each of the participants .
The model was then used to predict how each child would react to changes in the computer game .
When they switched to robot basketball , they found that the model ’s predictions were equally accurate .
“ The model is about as good at identifying a child ’s emotional state as an experienced therapist .
When a child gets a new therapist , as often happens , there is a learning curve as the new therapist gets to know the child , whereas the accuracy of the model should continue to improve over time , ” Sarkar points out .
A robot ’s ability to provide consistent and predictable responses should be particularly useful for treating ASD .
Each child has individual triggers .
For example , one child may not like direct eye contact .
Another might be upset by loud voices and sounds .
Yet another may react when people get too close .
Once a particular trigger is identified , a robot could be programmed to increase the stimulus at such a gradual rate that the child does n’t notice it .
The robot could also be programmed to back off when it senses that its responses are beginning to bother the child .
In this fashion , it could build up the child ’s tolerance to the problem stimulus .
“ Robots can be programmed to respond with a consistency that is difficult for humans to achieve , ” Sarkar points out .
According to the autism expert , something that robots lack may also be an advantage in this setting .
“ I ’ve always been interested in the idea of teaching social skills in a non-social situation that is less threatening .
The children can be distracted by a lot of sensory stimuli coming at them .
Social stimuli are particularly complex and can confuse them .
So alternative methods of teaching that can subtract the social component could be very helpful as a beginning step , ” Stone says .
In the future , the researchers foresee technologies like robots and virtual reality environments as taking over some of the burden of the behavioral therapy that is one of the most time - consuming and expensive aspects of ASD treatment .
“ This approach holds great promise , ” says Stone .
“ It will involve many steps and this is just the beginning .
There are lots of different possible applications .
So it is just a matter of finding the resources to explore them all . ”

Haskell has no " support " for currying or partial > application .

Haskell is merely a convention ( with , admittedly strong - social - > ramifications . )
The only way one could say Haskell " supports " currying > is that it has a lightweight notation for nested lambdas .
Compared to most other languages , that lightweight notation makes enough of a difference that it 's reasonable to say that Haskell " supports currying and partial application " .
E.g. , in Haskell : f x y z = ...
Haskell without the above notation : f x = \y -> \z -> ... Javascript , to underscore the point : function f( x ) { return function ( y ) { return function ( z ) { ... } } } " Standard " Scheme : ( define ( f x ) ( lambda ( y ) ( lambda ( z ) ... ) ) )
Scheme with a common macro to " support currying " : ( define ( ( ( f x ) y ) z ) ...)
That 's just the function definition side .
On the application side , Haskell has a lightweight notation for application in general , i.e. you write " f a b c " instead of e.g. " f( a ) ( b ) ( c ) " in C - like syntaxes or " ( ( ( f a ) b ) c ) " in Lisp - like syntaxes .
Together , these two sugary treats make it quite a bit more convenient and practical to use currying and partial application in Haskell ( and ML , etc. ) , and this translates to * much * more use in practice .

RECIPE : Spaghetti Carbonara
This was one of the first " foreign " dishes I taught myself to cook , more than thirty years ago .
At the time , Italian food outside of Italy consistent mostly of lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs .
The idea that a pasta sauce could be so simple was revolutionary .
As with all simple dishes , the secret is in the quality of the ingredients , in this case , pancetta , eggs , and Parmasan cheese .
Pancetta , which means " little stomach , " is cured ( but not smoked ) pig 's belly that is sold either in a slab or rolled up like a jelly roll .
Look for pancetta with more fat than meat , because it 's the fat that is going to make this sauce flavorful .
I always have some pancetta in my freezer .
That way , I know I can always make myself a fast , delicious meal .
Make this for one , two , or four .
Any more and you 'll have too much spaghetti to handle .
It 's a great dish for those evenings when you 're home alone .
For one person , halve the recipe , using one egg and one yolk ; for hour people , just double everything , but use two frying pans .
This dish is great with a watercress salad .
Spaghetti Carbonara
Larder : originally called a lard house or lardy , the room where the bacon was stored ; over time it was more generally applied to the place where household food provisions were stored .

Add the spaghetti , stir , and return to a boil .
Adjust the heat so the water boils gently and cook until the spaghetti is al dente , 10 - 12 minutes .
Drain well .
While the water is coming to a boil , cut the pancetta into matchstick - sized pieces .
Place a large frying pan over very low heat and add the pancetta .
Cook gently so that it renders its fat and becomes crisp , about 10 minutes .
In a small bowl , whisk together the eggs and yolk , season well with pepper and whisk in half of the cheese .
When the pancetta is cooked , pour he wine into the frying pan and stir to deglaze the pan , scraping up the browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon .
Remove the pan from the heat .
Add the drained spaghetti to the pan .
Toss the spaghetti to coat it with the pancetta and fat .
Pour in the egg mixture and continue to toss until the spaghetti is coated .
The heat of the spaghetti and pan will cook the eggs .
Sprinkle with parsley and serve with the remaining cheese on the side .
If your spaghetti is not ready when the pancetta is finished , deglaze the pan anyway and remove it from the head .
Reheat and the pancetta and wine before adding the cooked spaghetti .

WTC Attack - Some Serious Questions
News Analysis by J.J. Johnson 11.01.01
With all the conspiracy theories floating around , a recent article has been published that might make even the most sheepish sheeple begin to scratch their heads .
There clearly is more going on than someone is telling us .
An article from the New York Daily news is frightening -- once you begin to look at the evidence .
Let 's go over this in detail , giving the government the complete benefit of the doubt .
If any one has more information on this , please let us know .
( Analysis in blue ) Cache of Gold Found at WTC Two truckloads
retrieved through a tunnel in rubble By GREG GITTRICH , THOMAS ZAMBITO and LEO STANDORA
Daily News Staff Writers URL Link to Complete Story Here Workers at Ground Zero unearthed last night a buried treasure of gold , hidden for weeks under the ruins of the World Trade Center .
As a small army of federal agents with shotguns and automatic rifles stood guard , city cops and firefighters packed two Brink 's armored trucks with the lode , sources said .
This is not a shocker , as it was rumored that as much as $ 160 Billion in bullion was stored under the Trade Center .
Let 's read on .
The sources said the gold was found in a delivery tunnel under 5 World Trade Center .
Ok -- stop right here :
Why would gold be in a tunnel ?
Maybe someone was trying to get it out on September 11 .
Completely explainable .
" They are taking gold out of there right now , " one source said last night .
" They 've brought in extra cops . "
It was n't immediately clear how much gold was recovered last night - or exactly how much was buried under the complex after the Sept. 11 attacks .
We heard up to $ 160 Billion - so it 's not a big secrect .
The Toronto - based Bank of Nova Scotia has said its vault under 4 World Trade Center alone held more than $ 200 million in gold and silver .
Bank spokeswoman Pam Agnew did n't immediately know if any of that gold was found last night .
Other companies are believed to have lost untold gold and valuables in the disaster .
For the last couple of days , construction workers - directed by the feds - had been clearing a delivery tunnel that runs under the complex .
So the feds apparently knew exactly where it was .
We can assume someone told them (? )
Officials finally got to the gold through that tunnel yesterday , after workers hauled out a 10 - wheel truck , several crushed cars and mounds of debris .
No bodies were recovered during the operation .
Huh ??
Let 's get this straight so far : $ 200 Million in gold ; found in a tunnel ; there were NO bodies found near the gold and the Feds knew it was there .
Like , there was n't anyone guarding that gold ?
Or there was , but they bailed out before the second tower collapsed ?
On foot ??
As workers inched closer to the gold yesterday , authorities began restricting access to the north side of Ground Zero and FBI and Secret Service agents joined cops and firefighters at the site .
Meaning , they knew EXACTLY where that gold was .
" If I tried to go down there , they would have shot me , " said a construction worker shooed away from the tunnel .
A handful of heavy - machinery operators and other workers , under the watchful eyes of more than 100 armed officers , built and graded a ramp into the delivery tunnel .
A small bulldozer knocked down a wall inside the tunnel , and a Brink 's armored truck drove in just before sunset .
It came out about 7 p.m. with the first load of gold , sources said .
A second truck entered the tunnel a short time later and also was loaded with gold before leaving .
A handful of construction workers were held over from the day shift , which ends at 7 p.m. , to help .
" They sent most of us on our merry way , " said one worker .
Click on Image for Full Size View Alright , take a look at Ground Zero .
Notice where Building # 5 is sitting .
Also notice how close the federal building is to Building # 5 ( right across the street ) .
According the report , the gold may have been moved from the Bank of Nova Scotia , whose vault was under Trade Center Building # 4 , adjacent to the first tower that collapsed .
It was clearly being moved AWAY from the South Tower .
This leads to the question : did someone suspect building # 4 would be so damaged ( from a collapse ) that it was imperative to move the gold immediately ?
Since the South Tower collapsed first and there were tons of debris in the tunnel , it is amazing NO bodies were found there guarding the gold .
There clearly was more going on than a human rescue operation on September 11 .

More than four years ago , following the " scandal " in which CBS News used forged documents in an attempt to attack President George W. Bush , I wrote that the modern news businesses — and especially newspapers — pretty much were relics of the Progressive Era ( that always seems to be with us , despite its supposed demise during the 1920s ) .
At that time , however , newspapers seemed to be surviving the digital and blog era .
That situation no longer exists .
It seems that each week brings more news about the moribund state of newspapers .
For example , the Seattle Post - Intelligencer now is up for sale , and if there is no buyer within 60 days , its owner has said it will close the paper or reduce it to an on - line publication .
The venerable New York Times , supposedly the " standard of journalism " which proudly wears its moniker " the newspaper of record , " has mortgaged its building in order to meet current expenses and there is no assurance that the " Grey Lady " will survive .
The culprit all over the country is the drop in advertising revenue and circulation .
For example , the Hearst Company , which owns the Seattle P - I , says it is losing millions of dollars , and cannot afford to keep the paper afloat any longer .
No doubt , that is true , but that only is part of the story .
After all , a drop in circulation and advertising dollars cannot be a cause , but rather an effect .
Yes , there is a serious economic downturn , but other entities that depend upon advertising still are viable , and newspapers have survived recessions in the past .
Analysts typically explain that newspapers are based upon " old world " technology that could not survive the digital age , and that is true , to a point .
For example , the rise of broadcast news , first radio , and then television , helped reduce the number of newspapers , especially in large cities such as New York .
People could hear about news events quickly , as opposed to having to wait until the next morning or that afternoon when the press runs were completed and the newspapers distributed .
Yet , it would seem that increases in technology should not stand in the way of competent news organizations being competitive .
Just as changes in technology have helped other industries cut costs and increase productivity , newspapers should have been able to do the same .
The market itself for news certainly has not dwindled , even if the mechanism for bringing news to the consumers has changed .
For example , three decades ago , the " major " news organizations were primitive in their scope compared to what is the situation today .
When Ted Turner launched Cable News Network ( CNN ) in 1980 , most pundits were extremely skeptical that the venture could survive , given that it was moving into uncharted waters .
( Because the " regulated " financial system would not fund the CNN start - up , Turner sought Michael Milken , whose investment bank underwrote the enterprise with so - called junk bonds . )
Today , the airwaves are crowded with 24 - hour news networks and radio shows .
However , there is another aspect to the rise in digital and computer technology that has undermined the typical newspaper , and the industry has adjusted very poorly .
I am speaking of the notion that journalists are supposed to be " professionals , " something that came from the Progressive Era , and it reflects an attitude that is not limited to just newspaper journalism .
One legacy of Progressivism has been the emphasis that all occupations be filled with " professionals . "
For example , the celebrated Jane Addams believed that charity work needed to be done by " professional " people , which ultimately gave us government social workers .
Other occupations which could be filled with people whose actual skills made them competent for the work at hand ultimately became closed to everyone but those who were " properly credentialed . "
There is nothing inherent in journalism that requires credentialing .
As one who has worked in newspapers off and on for three decades , I can say that the only skill needed is the ability to write quickly and accurately , and to be able to ask the right questions of people who are involved in the event the journalist is covering .
None of that requires a special line of education .
One excellent example of a great journalist who could not find employment in that line of work today is Henry Hazlitt , who wrote for a number of major publications , including the New York Times , back when it really was the " standard " for journalism .
Yet , Hazlitt never was a college graduate , even though his body of work was far greater and more intelligent than that of any Ph.D. economist or Pulitzer Prize winner today .
Today , the typical newspaper journalist is supposed to be " educated " and " respectable , " which generally means a degree from an Ivy League university or the equivalent for the " elite " media , and certainly a secular and mostly leftist worldview .
The actual work that occurs with good journalism rarely happens at the high levels any more , especially when the template that comes from the typical worldview of people in the " elite " newsroom can suffice .
An excellent example is the newspaper coverage of the infamous Duke Lacrosse Non-Rape , Non-Kidnapping , and Non-Sexual Assault Case .
The so - called evidence was transparently laughable , yet the New York Times , Newsweek , Time , and The Washington Post pursued the case as though the prosecutor , Michael Nifong , were the second coming of Sherlock Holmes instead of the Inspector Clouseau that he really was .
As K.C. Johnson and Stuart Taylor ( a former Times journalist ) noted in their book on the Duke case , Until Proven Innocent , the mainstream press was guided by a crude " narrative " of " white jocks abusing black women " instead of the facts , which clearly demonstrated that no rape or assault had taken place , and the New York Times was an especially bad offender .
Johnson , a history professor who runs a blog about the case , Durham - in - Wonderland , did some digging on his own and found out that Nifong had lent his campaign about $ 30,000 and until he began to pursue the lacrosse case , was behind and almost certainly would have been voted out of a job .
Despite the fact that campaign contributions were public record , no " official " journalist ever researched those campaign loans , which clearly raised questions about reasons why Nifong would have pursued the case in the way he did .
The large mainstream news outlets had vast resources at their disposal ; Johnson had his computer .
Yet , the amateur was able to outperform the " professionals . "
So much for the " credentials " that make journalists " respectable " and " qualified . "
Indeed , people are finding that someone with a computer and a cell phone can dig up and relay news as well as a highly - paid reporter — at much lower costs .
Furthermore , modern journalists often are little more than conduits for government officials or leftist pressure groups .
Despite that fact that every student in J - school is taught that the press is a " watchdog " of government , the truth is that journalists are the lapdogs of the state .
From the local police beat reporter to the top journalist at the New York Times , journalists pretty much repeat what government officials tell them .
When journalists actually do pressure government , it is either for the authorities to pass laws that are stricter than what they are at the present or to demand that governments regulate businesses in a draconian fashion .
What one rarely will see in a newspaper , either in the news section or the editorial page , is something that promotes real liberty — people living without having to constantly bow down to the authorities .
Instead , we will see journalists attacking gun owners , demanding the return of the " Fairness Act " ( to keep Rush Limbaugh off the airwaves ) , and repeating the latest fantasies of Al Gore .
In other words , they will demand the expansion of the state into the affairs of everyone except themselves .
( Most journalists seem to think that the Bill of Rights begins and ends with the First Amendment . )
Yet , it is not just the realization by the public that most journalists are not the Great Experts they claim to be that is bringing down newspapers .
Costs also play a huge role , and , not surprisingly , labor unions and government are in the middle of it .
Large newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post are dominated by labor unions , from the reporters to the people at the loading docks .
Labor unions often stand in the way of cost - effective capitalization that would bring down production costs and make the operations more efficient .
When there were few other competitors , the union intransigence did not make such a difference .
However , as the Digital and Internet Age advanced , suddenly labor unions no longer had the latitude they once did .
Yet , the " progressive " viewpoints of news organizations make it difficult for them to deal with the extra costs that unions place on them .
A paper like the New York Times is going to have even more cost issues than most papers because of the practices of unions in that city , and a " progressive " paper like the Times , which believes that every business should have a union , is not going to be willing to fight the battles that would keep them in business , as that would go against the paper ’s pro-union viewpoints .
The anti-entrepreneurial , interventionist or " progressivist " ideology that dominates the newsrooms also , I believe , stands in the way of newspapers being able to re-invent themselves and change to the current markets .
In the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s , IBM manufactured huge mainframe computers .
Today , the company mostly is engaged in consulting .
Between the mainframes and the present business model , IBM concentrated on personal computers and laptops .
In other words , the IBM of 1950 bears little resemblance to the IBM of today , yet the New York Times ( once known as the " Grey Lady " ) has not changed much in the past half - century , except now it does run color pictures and it has a website .
If there is any change to the paper , it is that its content is even more leftist than before .
On the same editorial pages that Henry Hazlitt once wrote , we now have the economic illiteracy of Paul Krugman , the latest Nobel laureate .
Unfortunately , while the news - gathering model has changed elsewhere , newspapers still labor under the pretense that everyone anxiously awaits the arrival of the newsprint copy , as everyone is in complete ignorance until the paper arrives .
At one time , that might have been true ( I used to wait for the morning paper to find out sports scores from the night before ) , but no longer .
Yet , IBM survives , but the New York Times may not .
Its people are finding out the hard way that the world no longer revolves around Linda Greenhouse ’s manipulative articles on the U.S. Supreme Court or Maureen Dowd ’s rants on the editorial page .
Although the Times editorialists and columnists still are offering much advice to others , it seems that perhaps they should understand that few people are listening anymore , and for good reason .
If and when the New York Times goes under ( unless it receives a government bailout , and I would not be surprised if that were to happen ) , everything and everyone else except for the real culprits will receive the blame for the paper ’s demise .
The pundits will claim Americans are short - sighted , or that free markets have failed , as the market participants failed to realize that the Times and other newspapers were the " soul of our society . "
What they wo n’t cite is the destructive progressivist statism that has dominated " elite " journalism for more than a century .
They wo n’t cite the unnecessary high costs brought on by labor unions and by the insistence that journalists be " credentialed . "
And they certainly will not admit that just maybe they were outhustled by people of " lower " credentials who were willing to dig and talk to people .
In a recent article in Reason , Jon Entine examines how activists took over the large pension funds and steered the money to Politically Correct causes .
The results have been disastrous , as the value of these funds has plummeted .
This is due not only to the current recession , but also to the fact that the " socially responsible " investments turned out to be real duds .
I mention this because " progressive " newspapers across the country touted these funds and this brand of investment as being the only morally - acceptable version of capitalism .
Today , as both " socially responsible " pension funds and " progressive " newspapers fall over the cliff , we can learn the lesson that progressivism in any form is hazardous to one ’s financial health .
The Best of William L. Anderson
That was quick .
A day after trying to defend changes to its Terms of Use , Facebook has pulled a 180 and decided to revert to its previous terms .
Earlier today , the company began polling its users about the controversial changes , with only 6 percent supporting them and 56 percent opposing ( the other 38 percent simply responded “ do n’t know ” ) .
We posted the same poll on Mashable and the results were far more decisive – 88 percent voting to revert , 7 percent to keep , and 5 percent indifferent ( as of 11 pm PT ) .
Once again , CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the one breaking the news .
In a blog post , he writes , “ Going forward , we 've decided to take a new approach towards developing our terms .
We concluded that returning to our previous terms was the right thing for now .
As I said yesterday , we think that a lot of the language in our terms is overly formal and protective so we do n't plan to leave it there for long . ”
In a smart response to what I ’ve previously characterized as a breakdown in communication more than anything else , the company has also established a Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities group , where members are encouraged to “ give input and suggestions on Facebook 's Terms of Use . ”
Smart move , Facebook .
Unlike the breakdown over Beacon , which lasted for weeks , Facebook has diffused this crisis in a matter of days .
Of course , it could ’ve been prevented in the first place by clearly explaining the changes before posting them , but it appears Facebook has taken steps to ensure that this issue does n’t plague the social network in the future .

Michele Bachmann .
She , does not want those couples making $ 65,000 to get the same tax breaks as the truly wealthy , and end up paying less federal tax .

A Brisbane man who went missing last week at a snow town in Japan helped develop a satellite tracking device for skiers which could have led searchers straight to him .
Former colleagues said it was unlikely Scott McKay was wearing one of the Flaik transmitters , which uses GPS technology to allow ski instructors to monitor up to 45,000 skiers in real time .
Scott McKay ... grave fears .
Mr McKay , 27 , was the one - time vice president of SnowSports Interactive , the Queensland company which developed the Flaik device .
The IT specialist also helped to road - test it at ski resorts overseas .
Let 's go back to the gold standard .
If the very idea seems at odds with what is currently happening in our country -- with Congress preparing to pass a massive economic stimulus bill that will push the fiscal deficit to triple the size of last year 's record budget gap -- it 's because a gold standard stands in the way of runaway government spending .

German Researchers Break Solar Cell Efficiency Record
January 20th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
A new year , a new solar cell efficiency record is broken .
German researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems have built a solar cell with 41.1 % efficiency , besting the previous record of 40.8 % efficiency set by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
The three - layer gallium - indium - phosphide , gallium - indium - arsenide , and germanium cell broke the record when researchers concentrated sunlight onto it 454 times .
The cell ’s materials are expensive compared to silicon , but are significantly more efficient .
This makes the Fraunhofer metamorphic triple - junction cell a candidate for concentrated solar installations , which require fewer materials than traditional installations .
Companies currently working on concentrated solar installations include SolFocus and Concentrix .

Lloyds Banking Group has sounded out shareholders about a change in its executive remuneration plans that could generate pay rises for its directors despite being bailed out by the taxpayer .
The bank , in which the government holds a 44 % stake , is understood to have approached big City investors between a month and six weeks ago with outline proposals for a modified pay package for the executive team of the bank .
The discussion about possible pay rises comes as research by the Guardian shows that 12 top bankers earned more than £ 1bn in performance - related pay and shares in the run-up to the credit crunch - even though their banks have subsequently racked up more than £ 300bn in losses , writedowns and emergency bail - outs from governments and shareholders .
Nevertheless , advisers to the recently created Lloyds Banking Group are thought to have argued to shareholders that pay rises were warranted because the new bank was considerably larger as a result of the takeover of HBOS in a deal brokered by Gordon Brown last September at the height of the banking crisis .
One shareholder said : " It was not the best time to bring forward a plan where the potential rewards looked quite big . "
In the face of shareholder reticence , Lloyds withdrew the plan and has not awarded pay rises for its directors .
But a fund manager said he still expected the bank to return with a new scheme , " but a little less generous " .
Shareholders advised Lloyds to put its plans in front of UK Financial Investments , the body set up by Alistair Darling , the chancellor , to look after taxpayer stakes in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland .
UKFI refused to comment but would be able to influence any potential pay deals .
While it does not want to dictate levels of pay to the banks , it is likely to be aiming to influence the basis upon which pay cheques are handed over .
Eric Daniels , the Lloyds chief executive , is currently paid a basic salary of £ 1.03 m .
The bank 's other five executive directors before the HBOS takeover was announced had a basic salary of between £ 590,000 and £ 680,000 .
They also have short - and long - term incentive schemes that include annual bonuses of up to 200 % of basic salary , with the exception of Daniels , who can boost his salary with a 225 % bonus payout .
WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama plans to include about $ 300 billion in tax cuts for workers and businesses in his economic recovery program as he seeks to win over Congressional skeptics worried that he was too focused on government spending , advisers said Sunday .
The legislation Mr. Obama ’s team is developing with Congressional Democrats will devote about 40 percent of the cost to tax cuts , including his centerpiece campaign promise to provide credits up to $ 500 for most workers , costing roughly $ 150 billion .
The package will also include more than $ 100 billion in tax incentives for businesses to create jobs and invest in equipment or factories .
The overall package , of $ 675 billion to $ 775 billion , is taking shape as Mr. Obama arrived in Washington and planned to begin trying to build support in Congress and among the broader public for his approach to stimulating the economy .
Mr. Obama , who flew to the capital Sunday to join his family in a hotel suite while awaiting his inauguration , planned to meet with Congressional leaders on Monday and deliver a speech on Thursday laying the ground for his emerging economic program .
Although some tax cuts were always expected to be included in Mr. Obama ’s economic package , his team disclosed the scope and some details of the plans Sunday at a time when Republicans have begun voicing criticism of what they describe as an open - checkbook approach to spending .
By focusing more attention on the tax cuts in the plan , Obama aides hope to frame it as a balanced , pragmatic approach .
Phew , what a scorcher :
The koala who cooled down by taking a cold bath in a bucket
He had lost his mother , did n't know the way to his tree and felt very hot and ill .
Nothing that a nice cold bath could not fix .
This baby koala was forced to take refuge from Australia 's heatwave in a bucket of water placed out by some friendly neighbours in Maude , near Melbourne .
First , he stuck his tongue in for a drink and then clambered in himself to cool off .
He sat in the bucket and waited quietly , with a very drippy muzzle , until wildlife officers arrived to rescue him .
When he has recovered he will be returned to his mother , who was waiting in a tree nearby .
She had abandoned him after becoming disoriented in the heat .
The koala takes a cold bath to escape the scorching heat after being abandoned by its mother
Tracey
Young found him huddled beneath a her veranda , shaking and looking very sick .
' The mum had become distressed and disorientated by the heat so she left the baby on its own , ' she said .
' They 're normally up the tree together , in a pair , and we see them all the time .
' I had to scoop water up in my hand to get it to drink and at first it was n't very responsive .
Thirsty work :
The koala began by having a long drink after becoming dehydrated
' Eventually it realised the water was in the bowl and it just climbed in itself .
' The kids , being very protective , circled the koala until the wildlife lady came and took it .'
The koala is being cared for by animal welfare staff until it is strong enough to be released .
Mrs Young , who lives in Maude , a town between Melbourne and Geelong , said its mother had returned to their backyard , apparently waiting for its baby to come back .
Bizarrely , the little koala has now become an internet star after pictures of it in the bucket were emailed around the world .
Australia 's wildlife has been suffering in temperatures which have stayed above 104f ( 40 c ) for six days in some parts .
Many animals have become dehydrated and perished .
... it then appears to check the temperature with a paw before clambering into the bucket

Confession of a crime is considered highly persuasive in court .
It seems inherently honest .
Why would an innocent confess guilt ?
It appears counterintuitive to basic human self - interest .
And yet , innocents do confess , and studies have shown that they are highly persuasive , even when jurors know they were coerced .
According to the Innocence Project , false confessions contributed to 25 % of wrongful convictions in the U.S. in 2008 .
Perhaps more disturbing is that the confession itself can corrupt evidence that would otherwise excuse a defendant .
This according to research published this month in the journal www3.interscience.wiley.com / journal/118505413/home .
Scientists had 206 subjects witness a " staged " crime and then were asked to pick the perpetrator from a line up .
They were later told that their choice denied the crime , and nearly 30 percent changed their identified pick .
But the greatest change occurred when participants were told that another person , not the person they picked , had confessed to the crime .
Now , 61 percent changed their identification , choosing the confessor .
When asked to explain their change , subjects revealed they were actually convinced by the confessor , and not simply complying with it , saying , " His face now looks more familiar than the one I chose before . "
Despite the presumption in law that different types of evidence are to be considered independent , this research shows just how tough it is to keep human nature from seeping in and tainting hard logic .

Real estate investments can greatly diversify your investment portfolio .
When you are investing in land or property , your exposure to sectors outside of the stock market expands .
But , real estate investing is not the same as equities or debts .
Keep reading so you know how to invest the right way in real estate .
You need to decide the type of real estate you want to invest in prior to beginning your adventure .
It may be that flipping real estate is the best fit for you .
Or , you might prefer to build from scratch .
You will need to learn the basic skills regardless of what you choose .
Remember that reputation is key in this realm of business .
Be impeccable with your word , and build a reputation for being trustworthy .
This gives you credibility with clients and helps you gain their loyalty .
When making a financial plan , you need to make certain you have thought of all of the related expenses .
You also need to factor in costs for closing , staging and legal matters .
When coming up with your profit margins , think about every possible cost then include them in the line item list .
If you are comparing industrial or retail properties , consider these two guidelines .
First , you should n’t overpay for where you buy things .
Second , do n’t pay too much for the business .
Consider every aspect of the property ’s value .
You need to see good numbers if the property is something you ’re interested in .
It can be extremely helpful to sit back and listen during negotiations .
This will help you to get the best deal .
If you listen , you may be able to get a reasonable price .
Join an investor group online or follow the blogs of some of the most successful real estate investors in the world .
This will help you learn useful strategies .
You can even sometimes have conversations with some of these people .
Try not to purchase poor properties in real estate .
Even if you ’re thinking it ’s a good price , the property could be stuck with you for quite some time because nobody will want it .
Invest in something more desirable to ensure that you will get a good return .
When investing in real estate , make sure you ’ve got a great handyman .
If not , your positive cash flow could be spent on tons of expensive repairs .
Your handyman can help to correct the issues that you face .
Look over the entire neighborhood before buying a property .
The right neighborhoods hold value , but bad neighborhoods are not going to provide you with a solid return .
Buyers look closely at location , and you should too .
You never want your investments in real estate to start draining your liquid cash reserve .
Investing in real estate means that you wo n’t be able to access a lot of money for a while , and the returns can stretch for many years .
You do n’t want to mess up your daily life by tying up the wrong funds .
Your investments should never tap into your emergency funds .
You must understand that investing in real estate can tie up your money and spread returns out over periods of years and years .
Make sure daily life does n’t get negatively affected by this .
It is wise to not let your investment properties demand too much of your management time .
Your time is valuable and you are n’t looking to be babysitting tenants .
Try to avoid vacation rental properties , college apartments and run-down neighborhoods .
Purchasing properties with solid rental histories can help save yourself from headaches down the road .
Begin with one investment .
Although purchasing multiple properties can seem like a good idea , if you are an inexperienced real estate investor , owning multiple properties is not always wise .
Instead , begin with a single property and allow yourself to learn an investment strategy over time .
It ’ll really help you over time .
Avoid over - leveraging yourself when moving on to a new real estate deal .
Be sure to make wise decisions that do n’t consume all of your investment capital .
In this way , you can be prepared for the unexpected .
Without the necessary capital , you can get burned .
One of the biggest mistakes people make is by investing in real estate that is out of their means .
If you ’re renting out your property , you have to be able to pay your mortgage , even if you have a few empty units .
You do n’t want to expect to be paying your mortgage with the rental income from the property .
Thoroughly investigate all potential tenants when you are investing in rental properties .
Untrustworthy tenants are going to be irresponsible and cause damage , hurting your property ’s value .
Running a background check can significantly reduce the odds that something bad will happen with a tenant .
When searching for a realtor with the most experience , avoid novices .
This is an investment opportunity you are looking at and those with little time on the job may not find what you are seeking .
The only way you find exactly what you desire is by using one with experience .
At least try hiring an experienced firm .
Think about purchasing in locales with lots of foreclosures if you are able to keep hold of properties for a fair amount of time before you need to sell .
These properties are going to increase in value eventually , and you will make significant money if you are able to be patient .
Keep in mind that it might be some time before you can cash in and get your money back , however .
Always keep enough capital on hand to cover the mortgage on your rental property , regardless of whether your tenant can make the rent .
You will feel better until the next tenant comes around when you have the extra money .
Understand the market lingo .
This will help you know what to say to the seller .
If a seller thinks you do n’t know anything , they can try to get over on you .
It is smart to use lingo and know - how to gain leverage .
You ’ll be at an advantage if you sound professional .
It ’s smart to do your research first before you begin investing .
After all , you need to ensure that you are making wise decisions and you do n’t invest in properties that are bound to be failures .
Move forward step by step and keep your strategies fresh if you wish to succeed .

Is Pot a Performance Enhancer ?
The unfair science behind the M(J ) Phelps suspension
( CNN ) -- Dr. John Di Saia was playing baseball with his son a few weeks ago , and just as he rounded second base , he tumbled to the ground , breaking his fall with his elbow .
Dr. John Di Saia was between health insurance plans when he ruptured his triceps tendon .
" Guess I should n't have been running in flip - flops , " says Di Saia .
At first he did n't think much of the injury , but as it became more painful , he showed it to a colleague , who told him he 'd ruptured his triceps tendon .
" He said I needed surgery immediately . "
One problem : Di Saia , a plastic surgeon in San Clemente , California , did n't have health insurance ; he 'd ended one policy a few weeks before and was about to start a new one .
" It 's pretty embarrasing when you 're a physician and you say you do n't have health insurance .
They think you 're some kind of an idiot , " he says .
Once he got over the embarrassment , Di Saia buckled down and negotiated with doctors and the outpatient clinic to get the price for his surgery cut in half , from $ 4,800 to $ 2,400 .
While he says he was clearly at an advantage being a doctor , he thinks everyone can -- and should -- negotiate health care costs if they do n't have insurance .
iReport.com : Lost your job ?
Share your story
" You should always ask .
Why would n't you try ? " he says .
Negotiating with doctors and hospitals is just one thing you have to learn how to do when your insurance disappears , says Steve Luptak , executive director of an assistance group called Healthcare Advocacy .
" I 've had so many people who 've just been laid off coming to me for help because they 've lost their insurance .
They 're so stressed , they 're so depressed , they feel like it 's the end of the world , " he says .
" But there are things you can do .
It 's not a futile situation , " he says .

Start with COBRA , which means you continue with your employer 's insurance , except now you 're paying the entire premium on your own .
You can learn about COBRA at the Department of Labor 's Web site .
If you can't afford to go on COBRA , you 're in good company ; a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund found that only nine percent of people who are offered COBRA actually use it .
Sometimes it 's less expensive to buy your own insurance policy rather than going on COBRA .
You can compare prices at ehealthinsurance.com .

All About Health Care Costs
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Banks that are big enough to destabilize markets should be subjected to tighter regulatory oversight , and some rules ought to be internationally agreed , White House economic adviser Paul Volcker said on Thursday .
Paul Volcker , former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank and current chairman of the President 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board , speaks at the " Emerging from the Financial Crisis " annual conference at Columbia University in New York , February 20 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Chip East
In testimony to the congressional Joint Economic Committee , Volcker added his name to the growing list of U.S. officials saying full nationalization of struggling banks was unlikely .
Instead , he said banks will probably need more government help to purge bad assets from their books , and the private sector may end up owning a bigger stake in some firms .
The former Federal Reserve chairman and close adviser to President Barack Obama faulted regulators for missing warning signs that financial firms were assuming too much risk , and called for “ substantial changes ” in oversight .
“ We must not again leave the markets so vulnerable that a breakdown will again threaten the national and world economies , ” said Volcker , the former Federal Reserve chairman who now heads up President Barack Obama ’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board .
His suggestions for regulatory reform included subjecting large banks to “ particularly high ” international standards for safety and soundness .
Trading and transaction - oriented firms that operate primarily in capital markets could be less intensively regulated .
However , for those firms that are big and complex enough to be systemically important , capital , leverage and liquidity requirements should be imposed .
“ Implicit in this approach is the need for strong cooperation and coordination among national authorities and regulators , ” he said .
“ Some approaches -- accounting standards , capital and liquidity requirements , and registration and reporting procedures -- should be internationally agreed and consistent , ” he added .
NO FULL NATIONALIZATION
Volcker said banks probably need government help to rid themselves of money - losing loans that are difficult to value or sell .
He raised the possibility of a publicly funded “ bad bank ” to house the bad assets , an idea that has been widely discussed but was not part of the bank rescue plan that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner sketched out earlier this month .
Geithner instead proposed a public - private partnership to buy up bad assets .
Volcker , when asked whether he thought Geithner ’s approach was correct , said what Geithner laid out was “ so general ” that he could not make a judgment .
That has been a common complaint of Geithner ’s plan , which envisions buying up as much as $ 1 trillion in bad assets but does not spell out exactly how it would work , or what portion of the money would come from taxpayers .
Volcker said the current financial crisis grew out of serious and unsustainable imbalances in the U.S. and world economy , and economic policy going forward must take “ appropriate measures ” to deal with that problem .
He said risk management failed on Wall Street , and “ lapses in financial regulation and supervision ... permitted institutional weaknesses to fester . ”
A global flashmob of ATM thieves netted $ 9 million in fraud against ATMs in 49 cities around the world .
Can anyone find the message - board where this one was cooked up ?
These people in the photos are believed to be " cashers , " low - level players , in a scheme devised from some mastermind — a dangerous computer hacker or hacking ring authorities fear could strike again .
Here 's how it all came down , according to information
Fox obtained from the FBI and law enforcement sources :
The computer system for a company called RBS WorldPay was hacked .
One service of the company is the ability for employers to pay employees with the money going directly to a card , called payroll cards , a lot like a debit card that can be used in any ATM .
The hacker was able to infiltrate the supposedly secure system and steal the information necessary to duplicate or clone people 's ATM cards .
" We 've never seen one this well coordinated , " the FBI said .
Then shortly after midnight Eastern Time on November 8 , the FBI believes that dozens of the so - called cashers were used in a coordinated attack of ATM machines around the world .
" Over 130 different ATM machines in 49 cities worldwide were accessed in a 30 - minute period on November 8 , " Agents Rice said .
" So you can get an idea of the number of people involved in this and the scope of the operation . "
In an absolutely shocking move , the United States House of Representatives has failed to pass the digital TV transition delay bill that was all but certain to fly through just days ago .
The bill needed two - thirds of the votes of the House under " special rules adopted for the vote , " and reportedly , the vote was just 258 to 168 in favor of changing the date .
As it stands , an estimated 6.5 million Americans are not yet prepared for the switch -- which is now back on track for February 17th -- and the money well for government - issued vouchers has ran dry .
Honestly , we 're elated to hear the news .
The February date has been blasted from the rooftops for years now , and changing it this late in the game would wreak all kinds of havoc in the industry , not to mention instill even more confusion .
Soon - to - be - vacated airwaves , we 're ready for you .

The first college in the US to divest from the Israeli occupation .
From Mondoweiss :
Teenage office worker sacked for moaning on Facebook about her ' totally boring ' job
Like many teenagers , Kimberley Swann was underwhelmed by the menial tasks she was given in her new job .
But while other 16 - year - olds might have confided in friends and family about the filing , stapling and hole - punching , she decided to let off steam by posting comments on the social networking website Facebook .
Three weeks later , the words ' first day at work .
omg ( oh my God ) !!
So dull !!' came back to haunt her when her boss discovered them as he surfed the net .
Sacked : Kimberely Swann , 16 , was shown the door after posting that her job at Ivell Marketing & Logistics was ' boring ' on her Facebook page
Another posting two days later complained , ' all i do is shred holepunch n scan paper !!! omg !' , while another fortnight of apparent misery produced the moan , 'im so totally bord !!!'
Miss Swann was called into Stephen Ivell 's office and fired on the spot before being marched from the premises in Clacton - on - Sea , Essex .
Yesterday , she said she was shocked at her treatment as her comments had been on a personal site and not intended to be seen by outsiders - least of all her employer .
' He called me into the office and said " I have seen your comments on Facebook and I do n't want my company being in the news " .
They said it was not good for the company .
' I did n't even put the company 's name , I just put that my job was boring .
They were just being nosy , going through everything .
I think it is really sad , it makes them look stupid that they are going to be so petty .
Place of work : Kimberley was sacked after owner Stephen Ivell took exception to her negative Facebook comments
' I was an office administrator , so of course it was boring at first and I knew it would get more interesting .
I was happy there , although they said I was n't .
It 's not fair .
I think it 's really out of order but there is nothing I can do now . '
Miss Swann , from Clacton , had worked as a waitress and in a call centre before being taken on by Ivell Marketing & Logistics , a product development and sourcing company , on February 2 .
On Monday this week , she was called in to see Mr Ivell who handed her a letter explaining her employment had been terminated .
It said : ' Following your comments made on Facebook about your job and the company we feel it is better that , as you are not happy and do not enjoy your work , we end your employment with Ivell Marketing & Logistics with immediate effect . '
Mr Ivell said his firm had done everything by the book .
' We were looking for a long - term relationship with Miss Swann as we do with all our staff .
Her display of disrespect and dissatisfaction undermined the relationship and made it untenable , ' he said .
' It is unfortunate that we did n't come up to Miss Swann 's expectations on this occasion and we wish her every success in the future . '
Employees are increasingly getting caught out posting unflattering comments on websites .
Last month , Marks & Spencer staff were caught branding customers ' idiots ' and ' cheap little b****** s' in a Facebook forum .
In November , British Airways staff caused uproar by calling passengers ' smelly and annoying ' , while Virgin Atlantic sacked 13 crew for describing passengers as ' chavs ' .
If there 's one thing my grandpappy taught me it's how to make gin in the bathtub .
And , if there 's another , it 's how to bury your money in coffee cans .
So he would probably scoff at paying $ 20 for the Backyard Safari Underground Time Capsule .
And , to make matters worse , you 're only supposed to bury the POS six inches under the ground so you can still fill it with more garbage via the fake rock screw - off lid .
Hey kids , I 've got news for you : if I see a fake rock in your yard , I 'm digging that shit up and stealing your G.I. Joes and love letters from Susie Q Heartbreak .
And , if it turns out to just be a house key hiding rock , I 'm letting myself in and kicking your ass !
Happy President 's Day !

Every year during Oscar season , you can always safely guess one thing :
Before the awards are presented , critics will complain about how predictable the Oscars are .
But while every year seems to have a few obvious results , you do get the occasional shocker .
Take the 1996 awards , for example , when Lauren Bacall was expected to be named Best Supporting Actress because , frankly , she was getting old .
Instead , young Juliette Binoche 's name was announced , which was a problem , because she had n't even prepared a speech .
" I do n't know why I got this , "  she apologized .
" I thought Lauren would win . " 
Yes , sometimes the Oscars can surprise .
Here are some of the most memorable occasions .
1. Katharine Hepburn ( 1932 - 33 )
As a young actress , Katharine Hepburn was dubbed " box - office poison , "  and was n't well - liked in Hollywood , so just being nominated for Morning Glory was surprising enough .
She did n't even show up to the Oscars ceremony , which she might have found entertaining .
Host for the night was liberal satirist Will Rogers , joking about Republicans , Hollywood big shots , even Oscars lobbying ( predating Jon Stewart 's Oscar night banter by 73 years ) .
His rudest joke , however , was reserved for the Best Actress award .
Upon opening the envelope , he summoned the other two nominees , May Robson and Diana Wynyard .
They rushed up excitedly , assuming that it was a tie ( as had happened with the Best Actor prize the previous year ) .
Instead , Rogers thanked them for their performances and announced that the winner was their rival , Katharine Hepburn .
( Funny , perhaps " ¦ but what a creep ! )
The stunned crowd replied with a half - hearted applause .
Hollywood later warmed to Hepburn , eventually giving her another three Oscars " “ more than any other actress .
Though she never bothered to show up , Hepburn confessed in 1998 that she felt touched by her Oscars .
" They gave me their respect and their affection .
It was a revelation " “ the generous heart of the industry . " 
Even after her death , she proved that she could still win Oscars , when Cate Blanchett took home a statuette for playing her in The Aviator ( 2004 ) .
2. Luise Rainer ( 1937 )
When Luise Rainer was nominated as Best Actress for The Good Earth ( 1937 ) , she did n't even bother to show up to the Oscars , opting to stay home instead .
She had won the previous year , and was convinced ( like most people ) that no actor could ever win consecutive Oscars .
Besides , she was up against the revered Greta Garbo , who had never won , for her acclaimed performance in Camille .
However , their boss , tycoon Louis B. Mayer , used his considerable power to get an advance peek of the winners ' names on the night " “ and found that Rainer had indeed beaten the great Garbo !
At the last moment , she was ordered to throw on a gown and rush to the awards ceremony , with no time even to apply her make - up .
When her second victory in a row was announced , the audience was somewhat taken aback .
While it was a great honor , it did n't do her much good .
Within a year , her career had fizzled .
" I have often heard the Academy Award to be a bad omen , "  she later said .
Still , she is the oldest living Oscar winner ( at 99 ) , so it 's not all bad news .
3 . An American in Paris ( 1951 )
The bookies could have made a killing during the 1951 Oscars , when it was assumed that A Streetcar Named Desire would sweep the field .
Easily the favorite , it would win four Oscars , including three of the acting awards .
A major upset happened , however , when the Best Director award went not to Streetcar director Elia Kazan , but to George Stevens for the long shot A Place in the Sun .
Of course , the Best Director usually directs the Best Film .
After this shock , all bets were off .
It could go either way : A Streetcar Named Desire or A Place in the Sun .
When the envelope was opened , at one of the most suspenseful Oscar nights ever , the winner was " ¦
An American in Paris .
There was an audible gasp from the audience , followed by loud applause .
People who were already leaving suddenly stopped near the exit , wondering if their hearing was all right .
Back then , musicals never won the Oscar for Best Film .
( The only exception was The Broadway Melody , way back in 1928 . )
Gene Kelly , the star of An American in Paris , had even been presented with an honorary Oscar that night , which is usually a consolation prize for people who will never win a " real " 
Oscar .
Now his producer , Arthur Freed , was proudly holding one of those statuettes .
4. Grace Kelly ( 1954 )
Judy Garland was a lock for the 1954 Best Actress award for the musical A Star is Born .
Not only was it a fine performance , but she was one of Hollywood 's best - loved stars .
Most of all , this was her great comeback , after years of breakdowns and personal struggles .
On the night itself , she was in hospital recovering from her latest drama : the premature birth of her son .
A camera crew was at her bedside , she was wired for sound , and her hair and make - up were done for the inevitable announcement .
To everyone 's shock , the Oscar instead went to 26 - year - old former model Grace Kelly , for The Country Girl .
To this day , critics call this one of the strangest decisions in Oscars history .
Once again showing her acting prowess , Garland smiled graciously at the news , while being secretly heartbroken .
Kelly would retire from acting two years later to become Princess Grace of Monaco .
5. Marisa Tomei ( 1992 )
At the 1992 Oscars , the favorite for best supporting actress was esteemed Australian actress Judy Davis , nominated for Husbands and Wives .
Still , she had some fine competition from classical British thespians Joan Plowright , Vanessa Redgrave and Miranda Richardson .
With such an outstanding field , many were flabbergasted when Jack Palance opened the envelope and announced that the winner was " ¦ cute young Brooklyn - born actress Marisa Tomei , for her funny performance in My Cousin Vinny .
To this day , film buffs can't believe it .
It was unkindly suggested that , upon opening the envelope , 74 - year - old Palance did n't actually read it , but absent - mindedly repeated the name of the last nominee .
For the record , many safeguards are in place to ensure that flubs do n't become official results .
But how could Tomei have won against such a prestigious group ?
Well , the Academy is famously patriotic .
The British vote would have been split " “ but as the only American nominee , perhaps it should have been surprising if Tomei had not won .
6. Roman Polanski ( 2002 )
Few film directors are as notorious as the French - born , Polish director Roman Polanski .
His outspoken opinions about Hollywood have upset many people .
His dark and disturbing films , like Repulsion , Rosemary 's Baby and Chinatown , are not exactly date movies .
Oh , and he has been a fugitive from justice since fleeing the US in 1978 while facing statutory rape charges .
So when he was nominated for his movie The Pianist , he was not considered a serious prospect , especially against Martin Scorsese , who ( as the Academy was often reminded ) still did n't have an Oscar after many years as one of Hollywood 's great directors .
Scorsese did n't have a lock on the award , however .
As Chicago swept the field , things were looking good for Rob Marshall , director of that crowd - pleasing movie .
But while Chicago would be named Best Film , it was Polanski who would take the Best Director prize " “ and despite his sordid past , this was greeted with a warm applause .
Of course , he could n't be there to accept it .
His friend Harrison Ford accepted it on his behalf .
7. Marlon Brando ( 1972 )
Let 's save perhaps the biggest surprise for last .
When Brando was announced as the Best Actor winner for The Godfather , it was no surprise .
Even though his Don Corleone was n't really the lead actor ( he died somewhere in the middle of the film ) , he was expected to win for his unforgettable performance .
The surprise was n't in the result , but in the acceptance of his award .
Instead of the man himself , a Native American woman in tribal regalia introduced herself as Sacheen Littlefeather .
" I 'm representing Marlon Brando this evening , and he has asked me to tell you that he very regretfully cannot accept this generous award " “ and the reason for this , being the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry . " 
After she left , to a stunned audience , presenter Clint Eastwood had to follow her .
" I do n't know if I should present this award on behalf of all the cowboys shot in John Ford westerns over the years , "  he said .
It was later reported that Littlefeather was actually an actress named Maria Cruz ( she has her rebuttal here ) , and that Brando still received the award , displaying it proudly next to his other Oscar .
Still , it goes down one of the great surprises of Oscar night history .
Microsoft is getting into the retail business .
The company announced today that it 's hired David Porter , a 25 - year Wal - Mart vet , as vice president of retail stores .
He will head up Microsoft's " efforts to create a better PC and Microsoft retail purchase experience " through its own stores .
This is a risky move .
Microsoft ( MSFT ) will be competing with its vast retail channel , which ranges from Best Buy ( BBY ) to Costco ( COST ) .
And last we checked , the retail industry is in the garbage .
Even Apple is suffering .
If done right , Microsoft might be able to show consumers the benefits ( if any ) of having a Windows computer , Xbox 360 , Windows Mobile phone , and Zune , all in one place .
At very least , they could do a better job than Best Buy at showing off PCs .
( We 're not sure how well the gurus Microsoft hired last fall to do that at other big - box stores worked out . )
Conceivably , they might convince more people to buy PCs -- or at least to buy newer PCs with Windows 7 .
But Porter will have to work magic to get people into a Microsoft store -- the " big-ass table " Surface computer wo n't be enough .
Even Sony's ( SNE ) retail chain , packed with PlayStations and whiz - bang digital gadgets , fizzled out .
Nokia 's ( NOK ) small chain of U.S. stores has n't done much to improve its market share here .
Palm ( PALM ) shuttered its retail stores last year .
And do n't get us started thinking about Gateway stores .
If anything , Porter will have to out - Apple Apple ( AAPL ) , whose minimalist , fun retail stores have helped drive sales and market share -- at Microsoft 's expense .
His pedigree wo n't hurt -- a few years at DreamWorks after 25 years at Wal - Mart ( WMT ) , where he was an entertainment merchandise manager .
( Apple took a similar strategy , hiring its retail boss Ron Johnson away from Target in 2000 . )

I have been a fan of Techdirt for a few years now but as Masnick becomes more and more rabidly pro-“ Free ” Market Capitalism , I start to reconsider .
I keep seeing articles which seem critical of one action only because it opposes the free market , not because of any utilitarian argument .
The latest post commenting on the recent siding of Mozilla with the EU anti-trust action against Microsoft is the latest such example of this trend .
Within , the author complains that such a move is obviously wrong as well as misguided as obviously there is n’t a monopoly since Firefox has managed to gain market share .
In the same breath however , he also mentions that the original instigator , Opera is an “ also - ran ” .
Basically what Masnick is saying is that if a complaint is made by someone who cannot gain any market share , it ’s because they are not good enough .
But if it ’s made by someone who managed to gain a foothold , it ’s disingenuous .
Whatever happens , there ca n’t be a monopoly issue brought up at all .
Anyone can easily see the fallacious reasoning here .
The truth of course is that Microsoft is not simply abusing its market position to stiffle innovation on the browser space but it has been doing so aggressively and for a very long and well documented time .
Firefox managed to achieve market acceptance despite Microsoft ’s monopoly on the space .
When the new browser came out , it did n’t even register on the radar until the first major grass root advertising and word - of - mouth campaigns started .
Even though it was vastly superior to any of MS ’ offerings , its growth was slow and tortured , owning mostly to the fact that most webpages were “ optimized ” for IE and flat - out refused to work with Mozilla based browsers .
Not only that but the fact that MS bundled IE with their OS made any viable alternative difficult to discover .
Why would most normal users even consider looking for an alternative browser which most of the time could n’t access their banking portals ?
Many times .
even when you put an alternative browser on one ’s desktop and advised them to use it , they would n’t because it was not what they were used to .
This is how deep the IE conditioning had gone .
There is no more striking example than what Techdirt dismisses quickly : Opera .
Almost everyone will tell you that for a long time before even Firefox got conceived , Opera was the undeniable leader in features , standards - implementation , speed and basically all there was in a browser .
And yet , it did n’t even make a dent in the market share of MS .
Techdirt , the stalwart defender of innovation for some reason does not even wonder why Opera did n’t make it but rather assumes that it must have been because they were not good enough or something .
In other words the classic selective view of reality that annoys me so much about Free Marketeers .
Of course Firefox managed to compete , in the same way that GNU / Linux managed to compete , by being adopted immidiately by the Free Software movement who then went had to fight uphill for every percentile of market share .
The reason they achieved it is because of their distributed nature , philosophical backing and knowledge of technology which allowed them to be unaffected or quickly overcome many of the hurdles in their way .
Does that mean that the competition was fair ?
Not at all .
It was stacked against them on every turn .
But they persevered .
Opera unfortunately had neither a huge community behind them , nor the budget required to raise awareness of its existence which is why then , and still now , it still ca n’t get market share , even though it is still considered by many as one of the better browsers .
However , were MS Windows to come bundled with Opera and IE and ask the user which one they wanted to use , then things would have been much much different .
Most people who did n’t know either , would give a try to each and stick with Opera overwhelmingly .
The author also brings as examples of competition Google ’s Chrome and Safari , both of which do n’t sustain his argument in the slightest .
The only reason either of those managed to achieve any market share is not because of any innovation but because of the popularity of their respective distributors .
Apple has a well known fanatic fanbase and a considerable market share in the OS , for which they also bundled their own product .
Google did a smart marketing campaign but overall Chrome , even though an inferior product from all others , gained share because it ’s suggested in the front page of the most popular search engine .
And with all this , IE still stands at ~ 70 % even though it ’s the worse of them all and Microsoft has done practically no marketing whatsoever about it and only a half - arsed effort to improve their own offering ( mainly by copying popular features ) .
If that does not give you a very clear hint that something is amiss , then I do not know what will .
Everyone must strive infinitely more to achieve even a single market share percentile while MS without doing anything can still enjoy a monopolistic percentage .
So yes , Firefox has managed to crack MS iron grip on the browser but that is not because a monopoly “ obviously ” does n’t exist but rather despite this very clear , for all but the Free marketeers , monopoly .
Just because they have managed to a degree to overcome the mountain of challenges posed by the anti-competitive business practices of MS does not mean that these practices should be left unpunished .
If you play a game and you opponent is obviously cheating but you nevertheless manage to defeat him by playing fair , does it mean that they do not deserve condemnation and punishment ?
Of course they do .
You do not punish them only when you lose , you do it regardless – not out of spite or revenge – but as a lesson and a warning for the future .
Leaving them unpunished simply gives the incentive to cheat the next time as well .
But the view of Techdirt is more inane than that .
When you play with a cheater and you lose , you ’re just a sore loser .
If you win , then they could n’t possibly have been cheating could they ?

• Obama ditches succession of Bush policies on hectic first day • Guantánamo to close within a year and tribunals suspended •
New foreign policy includes offer of negotiations with Iran
President Barack Obama yesterday devoted his first full day in office to ditching one discredited Bush administration policy after another - proposing the closure of the Guantánamo Bay prison and offering a new relationship to Iran .
Sitting behind the desk at the Oval Office at 8.35 am after a late night of inauguration balls , he set about trying to live up to the daunting expectations for his presidency both at home and abroad .
He gathered his military commanders to set new missions for Iraq and Afghanistan , and met his economics team to discuss a proposed $ 800 bn spending package to combat recession .
He also phoned world leaders to emphasise that a new president is in charge , with a completely different agenda and world outlook .
Although Obama 's team is reluctant to be compared with Franklin Roosevelt 's famous 100 days that brought in the New Deal - the measurement for all subsequent presidencies - it wants his 100 days to be just as historically significant .
Addressing assembled White House staff , he said he had been inspired by the estimated two million who gathered to watch him being sworn in .
He told staff he expected a higher ethical code at the White House than had existed under his predecessor , and issued executive orders imposing strict rules governing dealings with Washington 's lobbyists .
" Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency , " he said .
He also issued a pay freeze on staff earning more than $ 100,000 .
" Families are tightening their belts and so should Washington , " he said .
In an unsual move - described by the White House as an " abundance of caution " - he was administered the oath of office a second time because a word was out of sequence when he was sworn in on Tuesday .
Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath in front of reporters .
The most symbolically significant act of the day was to release a draft executive order to close Guantánamo within a year .
The camp , site of torture and other abuses , came to define the Bush administration .
The draft executive order which Obama is expected to sign today , says : " The detention facilities at Guantánamo for individuals covered by this order shall be closed as soon as practicable , and no later than a year from the date of this order . "
In two other executive orders , he is to ban torture by all US personnel and initiate a review of the cases of all those still held at Guantánamo .
He ordered judges to suspend trials under way there .
The most important meeting of the day was the one with military chiefs .
He wants to fulfil campaign promises to withdraw US troops from Iraq within his first 16 months in office , and to send new troops to Afghanistan .
His top commander , General David Petraeus , flew from Afghanistan to be present .
On the international front , Obama 's team posted on the White House website a new direction for foreign policy , of which the most startling was an offer to negotiate with Iran .
Although such a policy was a prominent feature of his campaign message of engagement with America 's enemies , the White House said such negotiations would be " without preconditions " .
That could pose a problem for Hillary Clinton , who was confirmed as secretary of state by the Senate yesterday by 94 votes to two .
She clashed with Obama in 2007 during her battle for the Democratic presidential nomination on this issue , saying it would be a mistake to sit down with the Iranians without first setting conditions .
The Bush administration had refused to negotiate with Iran until it first suspended its uranium enrichment programme , suspected by the west as a move to secure a nuclear weapons capability .
On the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , Obama made a point of ensuring that his first telephone calls to world leaders were to key players in the region .
He spoke to the Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , and King Abdullah of Jordan .
The fact that he called them first suggests the Israeli - Palestinian conflict will be a priority .
Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , said Obama " used this opportunity on his first day in office to communicate his commitment to active engagement in pursuit of Arab - Israeli peace from the beginning of his term " .
Some members of Obama 's team are known to be privately angry with Israel over the death toll and destruction in Gaza , despite Obama 's expression of sympathy for Israel over Palestinian rocket attacks .
Just days before the historic plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday , 20 % of Americans had seriously considered taking their money out of the stock market and 8 % already had .
But a majority ( 51 % ) were not too worried , or not worried at all about the money they have in banks .
Canada 's largest Jewish advocacy group will ask police to investigate whether hate laws were broken during recent rallies held in cities across Canada to condemn Israel 's attacks on Gaza – an allegation roundly dismissed Tuesday by the group 's Arab counterpart .
The Canadian Jewish Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation exchanged their latest barbs as the cauldron of emotion in the Middle East , set to boiling by Israel 's invasion of the Gaza Strip , continued to spill over international borders .
The congress has video and images from " pro-Hamas " protests in Toronto , Montreal and Calgary that were " uncivil , un - Canadian , that demonize Jews and Israelis , " and might have violated Canadian laws , CEO Bernie Farber said in an interview .
" Some of the rhetoric and chants that we have heard are everything from calls to murder , to comparison of Jews and Israelis to Nazis , to calls to genocide , " he said .
The Jewish advocacy group , which intends to hold a news conference Wednesday to release the material , said it plans to ask both local police and the RCMP to investigate whether any crimes might have been committed .
Mohamed Boudjenane , executive director of the Canadian Arab Federation , dismissed the tactic as an attempt to divert attention from the horrors of Gaza – horrors perpetrated , he said , by the Israeli military .
" We had 10,000 people ( protest ) , " Boudjenane said .
" How can you control every single person there and not have someone who will scream some weird stuff or someone who could have a flag of Hamas or whatever ?
But the purpose of the march has nothing to do with that . "
Thousands of people have demonstrated in cities across Canada against the attacks on Gaza that have killed hundreds of people .
There have also been several similar rallies across the country expressing support of the Israeli action .
The Israeli government says the invasion was in retaliation for Hamas rocket attacks on Israel from the Palestinian territory .
The congress said it would release a list of those who co-sponsored the anti-Israel protests , among them the Ontario wing of the Canadian Union of Public Employees , the Canadian Peace Alliance and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers .
Boudjenane pointed out that numerous Jews have also rallied against the Israeli attacks , naming some prominent ones such as author Naomi Klein and political and social activist Judy Rebick .
They are n't anti-Jew , he said , but were only there to protest the ``massacre " happening in Gaza .
Boudjenane also accused pro-Israeli counter - demonstrators of taunting the pro-Palestinian side with such epithets as " murderer " and " terrorist . "
Farber said if the temperature is n't brought down , the rallies could lead to real violence in Canada or attacks on Jewish institutions , as has happened in some places in Europe .

" We are firm supporters and believers in the need to be able to passionately demonstrate in free and democratic societies , " Farber said .
" But most us as Canadians also abhor the vilifying and demonizing and promoting some of the most hateful images that one can really imagine in terms of such demonstrations . "

Contagious Defections
How far will mainstream economics go in breaking with the increasingly discredited Washington Consensus ?
By Mark Engler
This is a web - only article from the website of Dollars & Sense : The Magazine of Economic Justice available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
Back in March 2008 , before the financial crisis had reached historic proportions , concerned observers of the global economy had already begun reaching for metaphors of ill health .
An article that appeared in Der Spiegel , Europe ’s most influential newsweekly , worried that the United States ’ declining fortunes had already harmed the European economy , and that worse was to come : “ It ’s like the beginning stage of the flu , when the patient still appears healthy and strong , ” the article explained .
“ But the virus is already replicating in the body , and the patient is beginning to feel the effects of joint pain and crippling fatigue . ”
The final result could be “ a collapse of the global financial system . ”
The world economy is now well beyond the early stages of a cold .
But Der Spiegel ’s analysis could today be applied to the battle of ideas — its diagnosis an apt assessment of the intellectual underpinnings of corporate globalization .
These days , the doctrine of market fundamentalism still has enough defenders for a few to perceive a healthy disposition .
Yet its ample defectors and ever - more vocal detractors will make most people suspect that its constitution is seriously compromised .
One can witness an evolving debate about globalization both in public discussion and in several of the books about the global economy published in 2008 .
These bolster the sense that once - dominant economic neoliberalism may never recover the strength it recently possessed .
Two such works are Bad Samaritans : The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism by Ha-Joon Chang and Common Wealth : Economics for a Crowded Planet by Jeffrey Sachs .
Although they differ significantly in their outlooks , both indicate an intellectual climate in which it is preferable to be perceived as a critic of the runaway market economy , rather than a champion of it .
Kicking Away the Ladder
Bad Samaritans is the more radical of the two books , yet the type of neo -Keynesian propositions it lays out are increasingly becoming the norm in economic debates .
Chang , an economist at the University of Cambridge , opens with a bit of personal and economic history .
“ Korea , one of the poorest places in the world , was the sorry country I was born into on October 7 , 1963 , ” he writes .
“ Today I am a citizen of one of the wealthier , if not wealthiest , countries in the world ....
During my lifetime , per capita income in Korea has grown something like 14 times , in purchasing power terms . ”
Noting that it took the United States a century and a half to realize a similar advance , he writes , “ The material progress I have seen in my 40 - odd years is as though I had started life ... as an American grandfather born while Abraham Lincoln was president . ”
The account of Korea ’s economic history long preferred by the international financial institutions in Washington , DC held that the country sparked its miraculous growth by embracing the free market : keeping tight control of inflation , limiting the role of the state , lowering trade barriers , and inviting foreign investment .
Advocates of corporate globalization , in short , hold up the country as a model of neoliberal economics .
They then preach that countries wanting to replicate its success should hew to the International Monetary Fund ’s “ free trade ” dictates .
Yet the truth of Korea ’s success hardly fits the pattern they would like it to .
“ What Korea actually did during [ the past four ] decades , ” Chang explains , “ was to nurture certain new industries , selected by the government in consultation with the private sector , through tariff protection , subsidies and other forms of government support . ”
Blatantly violating the policies regularly prescribed for poor nations , the state also owned all the country ’s banks , kept tight control over the flow of foreign currency in the country , and ran its own businesses in key areas where it felt the private sector had invested insufficiently .
The country ’s leaders moved toward more open trade only when its industries were well prepared to compete internationally .
Korea , as it turns out , is hardly an exception .
Chang ’s wider point is that “ practically all of today ’s developed countries , including Britain and the United States , the supposed homes of the free market and free trade , have become rich on the basis of policy recipes that go against the orthodoxy for neoliberal economics . ”
Drawing on a 1841 quote from German economist Friedrich List , Chang charges that advanced industrial nations are guilty of “ kicking away the ladder ” — prohibiting developing countries from using the very tactics that allowed them to ascend in the global economy .
Given capitalism ’s foundational and often - celebrated exaltation of self - interest , one might surmise that wealthy countries are motivated in their ladder - kicking by a crass desire for greater market access for their own goods and services .
However , Chang takes a gentler stance .
He argues that , in the late stages of their economic development , countries like the United States and Britain have rewritten their economic histories to make themselves seem like paragons of free market virtue when “ in fact , for a long time they were the most protectionist countries in the world . ”
The great majority of free market politicians , he contends , are genuinely well intentioned but have been duped by this revisionist history .
Thus , they have become bad Samaritans , “ making the lives of those whom they are trying to help more difficult . ”
That ’s No Way to Grow
Chang ’s publishers somewhat disingenuously market him as a fresh new voice on the economics scene .
In fact , although still relatively young , he has been involved in writing or editing over a dozen books .
The most prominent , Kicking Away the Ladder , actually took its name from the aforementioned List quote , and it advanced many of the same ideas as Bad Samaritans , if in a more technical manner .
At this point , Chang ’s historical argument seems so solidly documented and sensibly put to be almost pedestrian .
Its urgent relevance becomes clear only when it is placed against the unrelenting “ free - trade ” advocacy of laypeople like Thomas Freidman and the editorial board of The Washington Post , or against the work of party - line economists who , even in these days of government bailouts for Wall Street , remain in a state of denial .
For all their blasé self - confidence , defenders of the Washington Consensus have failed to answer the most damning charges against neoliberalism .
The fact that most consistently nags is that the policies of corporate globalization have failed to live up to its promoters ’ central promise : robust GDP growth .
Chang notes , “ [ d ] uring the 1960s and 1970s , when they were pursuing the ‘ wrong ’ policies of protectionism and state intervention , per capita income in the developing countries grew by 3.0 % annually ....
Since the 1980s , after they implemented neoliberal policies , they grew at only about half the speed ” seen previously .
“ Growth failure , ” he notes , “ has been particularly noticeable in Latin America and Africa , where neoliberal programmes were implemented more thoroughly than in Asia . ”
Studies purporting to show that globalizing nations fare better than non-globalizing ones fall apart if countries like China — which , as Chang reminds us , has steadfastly protected its economy — are not misleadingly categorized as “ free trade ” exemplars .
The reason is clear .
Chang compares the act of forcing developing countries to prematurely adopt “ free trade ” policy with the prospect of sending his six - year old son out into the open labor market to learn the value of hard work and thrift .
Hypothetically , free - marketeers might contend that putting the boy into the workforce would allow him to overcome the dependency of parental care and to thwart market - distorting subsidies like public education .
In the short term , the kid would probably bring in more cash than the average deadbeat first - grader .
But obviously , his life choices — and future income — would be noticeably constricted .
Ultimately , Chang is not against trade or movement toward open markets — if appropriately timed and planned .
At the same time , he seems to relish the opportunity to take shots at some of the most hallowed tenets of the corporate globalizers .
He argues that foreign direct investment ( the holy grail of conventional development economics ) is not actually very helpful to poor countries in many circumstances .
He reminds us that some of the world ’s most efficient enterprises are state - owned ( think Singapore Airlines , repeatedly voted the world ’s favorite carrier ) , and that many now - private businesses became world - class firms under state control .
And he makes a damning case against intellectually property laws designed by self - interested lobbyists at corporations such as Disney .
Chang is not alone in voicing many of these views .
Even some his foils , such as Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati , are critical of overzealous protections for corporations ’ intellectual property .
And the prevalence of this criticism is part of a wider trend .
In the decade since the Asian financial crisis , the accumulating failures of neoliberal mandates have led to a dramatic increase in the number of mainstream economists who are willing to speak out against them .
Arguments once commonplace at the protests and teach - ins of the global justice movement — but taboo within economics departments — have moved to far more central places in the public debate .
The increasing prominence of Chang can be considered part of this shift .
The more prototypical example of it is his mentor , Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz , who made a swift transition from being chief economist at the World Bank to being an outspoken critic of market fundamentalism and a persistent thorn in the side of the IMF .
The policy alterations that have accompanied the changing intellectual scene have already proven significant .
Witness the changing fate of the IMF : not long ago the institution was the head of a powerful Washington cabal in development policy .
To escape its grasp , developing countries have paid off their loans to the IMF early and built up large currency reserves in recent years so as never to have to return to Washington in the event of future emergencies .
Today , the Fund ’s recommendations are regarded as ideologically suspect at best .
The institution thus became a shadow of its former self — and is now desperately trying to use the new financial crisis to reinvent itself .
Allied bodies like the World Bank are facing difficulties of their own , and the American electorate has clearly grown suspicious of unchecked deregulation , making the terrain of globalization debate at the start the post - Bush era very different from that seen at the end of the Clinton years .
An Unrepentant Convert ?
Another individual that many think of as a defector from the beleaguered Washington Consensus is Jeffrey Sachs , currently the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University .
Sachs first came to prominence in the late 1980s as the wunderkind Harvard economist who , in his early thirties , was called in to fix the imperiled economies of countries including Bolivia and Poland .
He treated these patients with what has since become known as “ shock therapy ” — the all - at - once imposition of a slate of free market initiatives — with controversial results .
In 2005 Sachs reentered the limelight , this time as an anti-poverty crusader , with a book entitled The End of Poverty .
It was a staunch defense of foreign aid and of the United Nations ’ Millennium Development Goals .
It championed the cause of ending extreme poverty as the defining challenge of our generation .
The best - selling book ’s success has solidified Sachs ’ standing in the celebrity humanitarian circles inhabited by the likes of Bono and Angelina Jolie .
If Sachs gives the impression that he has lived a dual life , his distinct identities have each been brought into relief in the past year .
On the one hand , he has just released a new book , Common Wealth : Economics for a Crowded Planet .
In addition to reiterating his calls for a resolute international effort to address poverty , the book expresses concern about global environmental problems , especially climate change .
He argues that in the twenty - first century , “ The challenges of sustainable development — protecting the environment , stabilizing the world ’s population , narrowing the gaps of rich and poor , and ending extreme poverty — will take center stage .
Global cooperation will have to come to the fore .
The very idea of competing nation - states that scramble for markets , power , and resources will become pass� . ”
He calls upon global society to “ [ think ] ahead and [ act ] in unaccustomed harmony . ”
On the other hand , even as he has set out to proselytize for this apparently liberal internationalist program , Sachs has suffered a withering progressive attack on his reputation .
In Naomi Klein ’s The Shock Doctrine , Sachs appears as one of central villains in the story of neoliberal capitalism ’s forceful and undemocratic rise .
Dubbed “ The New Doctor Shock , ” he is held up as second only to Milton Friedman in his responsibility for spreading the ravages of the unrestrained free market in past decades .
Now , to identify Sachs as the embodiment of neoliberalism is somewhat unfair : he has long combined advocacy for debt relief , foreign aid , and social safety nets with his belief in capital ’s powers , and he has had his fair share run-ins with the IMF over the years .
Yet Klein is accurate in portraying Sachs as the more liberal face of market orthodoxy .
And those who might think that Sachs is currently atoning for past sins need only to look at his unrepentant attitudes toward the countries he previously advised .
In The End of Poverty and elsewhere , Sachs takes credit for ending Bolivian hyperinflation .
He has lauded President Gonz�lo “ Goni ” de Lozada — who went on to implement more radical and far - reaching neoliberal initiatives than Sachs himself had recommended — as a “ genius ” under whose guidance Bolivia “ made a fundamental turn toward macroeconomic stability ... [ and ] economic growth . ”
Poland , in Sachs ’ view , was an even more unqualified success .
He writes , “ By 2002 , Poland was more than 50 % richer in per capita terms than it had been in 1990 , and it had logged the most successful growth record of any post - communist country in Eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union . ”
In her criticism of Sachs , Naomi Klein rightly points out that most Bolivians see their history very differently .
Goni ’s reshaping of the economy took place amid massive protests , reforms exacerbated the country ’s deep inequalities , and the poor were disproportionately made to bear the anguish of the changes .
Klein sees Poland as an even greater affront :
As of her writing , the country had the highest unemployment rate in the European Union , and “ 40 % of young workers were unemployed in 2006 , twice the EU average . ”
She writes , “ Shock therapy , which eroded job protection and made daily life more expensive , was not the route to Poland ’s becoming one of Europe ’s ‘ normal ’ countries ( with their strong labor laws and generous social benefits ) but to the same gaping disparities that have accompanied the counterrevolution everywhere ... from Chile to China . ”
Sachs is reportedly upset by his portrayal in Klein ’s book .
Unfortunately , the public has yet to benefit from a head - to - head debate :
When the two authors were slated to be on the same panel at the American Sociological Association conference in Manhattan during the summer of 2007 , Sachs backed out — due to a scheduling conflict , he says .

Whatever the case , the makeover that Sachs continues with Common Wealth is less a defection than a re-branding exercise .
In the new book , he repeatedly states that the market alone is not enough : “ The pressure of scarce energy resources , growing environmental stresses , a rising global population , legal and illegal mass migration , shifting economic power , and vast inequalities of income are too great to be left to naked market forces and untrammeled geopolitical competition among nations . ”
Yet Sachs is n’t so much critiquing the harm that markets can do as he is suggesting that they need to be nudged every once in a while with some government - sponsored “ incentives ” to work in the public good .
Chang characterizes Sachs ’ earlier writing on economic integration as “ more balanced and better informed ” than Jagdish Bhagwati’s , “ but ultimately flawed . ”
In the end , Sachs retains the belief that trade , commerce , and technological progress will inexorably lead to growth and prosperity .
In fact , in Sach ’s view , technological progress and prosperity are what make eliminating poverty possible .
In one tidy paragraph , he dismisses exploitation as a significant force in the world economy .
Instead , Sachs writes , “ technology has the wonderful property of being non rival ; each person , business , or country can adopt the technology without the ability of other to adopt technology as well . ”
Thus , all can thrive .
“ The central solution to ending extreme poverty , ” Sachs explains , “ is to empower the poor with improved technology so that they can become productive members of the world economy . ”
Since the poor cannot afford these technologies on their own and are stuck in “ poverty traps , ” wealthier nations must provide generous foreign aid to help them to their feet .
His heroes in this endeavor are philanthropists like John D. Rockefeller and Bill Gates , who have seen the wisdom of investing in humanity ’s common well - being .
Technological boosterism also infects Sachs ’ prognosis for global climate change , making him a less - than - convincing environmental guru .
Common Wealth provides a familiar overview of the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels and the potentially disastrous consequences of global warming , warning that “ a business - as - usual path ... will not carry us to safety . ”
Sachs then preoccupies himself with demonstrating that “ powerful technologies ” — including improved hybrid cars and devices that can collect excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — “ will likely be available to enable us to mitigate the climate shocks at a very modest cost . ”
With some dedicated public effort , “ modest economic incentives , ” and investment in research and development , he tells us , we can beat global warming on the cheap .
As for the type of political resistance that has vexed previous climate negotiations , this , too , can be easily overcome : “ Yes , there will be a fight over allocating costs , but it need not be a huge battle , ” he imagines .
As his book progresses , not only do Sachs ’ reassurances begin to seem Panglossian , but his can - do rhetoric grows bland .
Common Wealth suffers from the lack of memoir and storytelling elements that made The End of Poverty appealing , if problematic .
The new volume ends up reading something like a political campaign book — perhaps for someone running to head the United Nations Development Program .
Sachs is at his best when he takes up some of the grit of political polemics , like when he blasts the religious right and the Bush administration for undermining U.N. family planning efforts shown to effectively empower women , promote reproductive health , and curb runaway population growth .
But lobbyists and special interests are too seldom found in Sachs ’ account of political decision - making .
Rather , he presents bad policies as the result of “ the declining sense of global responsibility felt by U.S. politicians ” — something that can presumably be remedied by his impassioned argumentation , his many charts , his appeals to long - term self - interest , and his quotations from John F. Kennedy .
Digging Deeper
As global markets weather a new period of turmoil and instability , Sachs ’ ultimate confidence in the world economy ’s abundance will fail to comfort many .
Whereas
Sachs dismisses concerns about peak oil on the grounds that “ [ w ] e might run out of conventional petroleum in a few decades , but we have centuries left of coal and other nonconventional fossil fuels , such as tar sands and oil shale ” — which new technology , of course , will allow us to effectively exploit — there is no shortage of analysis suggesting that limits on natural resources are real and that the consequences are dire .
Likewise , there are ample observers of capitalism ’s recurrent downturns who will note that the unfettered market is not just limited in its ability to do good , as Sachs would have it .
It can also do ill , creating crises — financial and environmental — virulent enough to raise serious doubt about neoliberalism ’s sustainability .
While global capitalism itself may be adaptable enough to survive the demise of its most recent laissez - faire incarnation , the transition will mean real pain for people across the globe .
This will be felt by the millions of working people in advanced industrial nations with bad credit and stagnant wages who now face foreclosure on their homes .
And it will likely be felt by poor in global South as well — those who receive neither enough aid nor enough income to escape hunger and disease .
These people will be denied because countries that are clashing over oil resources and adopting beggar - thy - neighbor economic policies in an attempt to soften the downturn at home are those least likely to engage in Sachs ’ cooperative , multilateral campaign to end poverty .
That a reinvigorated charity drive will not suffice to solve global economic problems is almost certain .
The more difficult question is whether the financial and environmental problems neoliberalism has created might also thwart Ha -Joon Chang ’s strategy of neo-Keynesian , neo - developmentalist engagement with the global economy .
We must ask whether there is still space for more countries to replicate the economic success of past winners in a world of peak oil , global warming , and geopolitical instability — or whether these challenges will demand a more creative and thorough - going set of changes for an international order that , in a time of crisis , is rapidly being made obsolete .

“ It was hard for people to believe that it was all due ” to the excisions from the surgery , Dr. Milner said .

That began to change in 1962 , when Dr. Milner presented a landmark study in which she and H. M. demonstrated that a part of his memory was fully intact .
In a series of trials , she had Mr. Molaison try to trace a line between two outlines of a five - point star , one inside the other , while watching his hand and the star in a mirror .
The task is difficult for anyone to master at first .
Every time H. M. performed the task , it struck him as an entirely new experience .
He had no memory of doing it before .
Yet with practice he became proficient .
“ At one point he said to me , after many of these trials , ‘ Huh , this was easier than I thought it would be , ’ ” Dr. Milner said .
The implications were enormous .
Scientists saw that there were at least two systems in the brain for creating new memories .
One , known as declarative memory , records names , faces and new experiences and stores them until they are consciously retrieved .
This system depends on the function of medial temporal areas , particularly an organ called the hippocampus , now the object of intense study .
Another system , commonly known as motor learning , is subconscious and depends on other brain systems .
This explains why people can jump on a bike after years away from one and take the thing for a ride , or why they can pick up a guitar that they have not played in years and still remember how to strum it .
Soon “ everyone wanted an amnesic to study , ” Dr. Milner said , and researchers began to map out still other dimensions of memory .
They saw that H. M. ’s short - term memory was fine ; he could hold thoughts in his head for about 20 seconds .
It was holding onto them without the hippocampus that was impossible .
“ The study of H. M. by Brenda Milner stands as one of the great milestones in the history of modern neuroscience , ” said Dr. Eric Kandel , a neuroscientist at Columbia University .
“ It opened the way for the study of the two memory systems in the brain , explicit and implicit , and provided the basis for everything that came later  the study of human memory and its disorders . ”

Lewis Hamilton Now Can Win Races Ghost Riding
Total Pro Sports –
Who knew that a race car specifically Lewis Hamitlon ’s F1 car can be controlled by a single mobile phone ?
F1 enthusiasts Steve and Simon came up with the idea and designed a model car that was controlled with a cell phone .
They tested their miniature version of the McLaren F1 car in their office and to their surprise it worked .
The recorded video of their miniature F1 test drive was posted on You Tube and the rest is history for the two .
The car nut then puts the model through its paces on a circuit built around office desks before receiving a surprise invitation from McLaren to go and see their latest technology close up .
McLaren Engineers wired up an F1 car with the same specs that Steve and Simon designed their model car with and then let Lewis Hamilton take it out for the first ever ghost ride .
It was a success !!!!
This may just be the future of the racing , where drivers can be safe and control their cars from the press box , just like a video game .

Setanta is believed to be seeking an urgent meeting with the Premier League in the hope it will help broker a deal to regain the rights it lost in last week 's record - breaking TV auction .
The Irish company won only one package for the rights to broadcast the Premier League between 2010 and 2013 , cutting in half its current output .
That would restrict coverage to 23 matches on Saturday evenings , which analysts believe may not be enough to sustain subscriber numbers and could plunge the loss - making channel further into the red .
The talks will revolve around trying to re-secure the Monday night package , which Sky won last week , but those close to the process believe that such a manoeuvre would be " virtually impossible " .
The auction process is heavily regulated by an independent scrutineer under a compromise agreement with the European Commission .
The six - year agreement , signed in 2005 , allowed the Premier League to continue to auction its domestic rights collectively so long as its live matches were sold to more than one broadcaster .
Last Friday , the Premier League chief executive , Richard Scudamore , unveiled the new domestic rights deal , which will bring in £ 1.782bn between 2010 and 2013 .
Should Setanta be unsuccessful in securing a reverse of the auction , the state of the channel 's funding is bound to come under increased scrutiny .
Last night the media research group Enders Analysis questioned whether Setanta could survive in its current form .
It calculated that Sky had ended up with five packages after resolving to maintain the level of investment that has proved mutually beneficial for the pay - TV giant and the Premier League over the past 17 years .
Of Setanta , Enders said : " We must therefore envisage mass subscriber defections , with every 100,000 subscribers now worth approximately £ 10 m on in annual revenues .
Today , Setanta reaches about 1.5 million direct subscribers , slightly short of its required break - even total [ estimated at around 1.7 - 1.8 m at current prices ] .
With live Premier League football such a jewel in its crown , the fear is that Setanta could easily lose upwards of a third of its current subscriber base .
At the very least it has to review its entire business plan and survival cannot be taken for granted . "
But Setanta will hope to persuade its backers that it has a viable business , even with fewer Premier League matches .
" That said , it may also be the case that many diehard sports fans will still want Setanta even with a reduced Premier League offering , " Enders added .
" As a result the net benefit of reduced rights payments and subscriber numbers may actually prove positive . "
Setanta paid £ 159 m for its package of 23 games , a significant reduction on its existing deal .
However , the 20 % reduction on it existing outlay on the Saturday evening package will reduce its cost base .
It is believed that its strategy of trying to secure a discount on the £ 355 m it paid for 46 matches under the existing deal backfired when Sky won the fifth of six packages on offer .
Setanta had hoped to retain two but pay less .
Setanta is believed to be examining a number of options , including the possibility of persuading BSkyB to sub-licence the fifth package of Monday night matches back to the broadcaster .
Although the two rivals co-operate on selling matches to pubs , a deal that also covers home subscribers is seen as unlikely – partly because it may fall foul of competition rules .
A spokesman for Setanta dismissed suggestions that the business is in trouble .
" Following the outcome of the Premier League rights auction there is understandable speculation about the future of the business , " he said .
" But Setanta retain the right to show 46 Premier League games per season until the end of 2009 – 10 , along with a host of other top - class sport including international football , the FA Cup , golf , boxing , Indian Premier League cricket and Guinness Premiership rugby . "
" Real men go to Tehran ! " brayed the neoconservatives , after the success of their propaganda campaign to have America march on Baghdad and into an unnecessary war that has forfeited all the fruits of our Cold War victory .
Now they are back , in pursuit of what has always been their great goal : an American war on Iran .
It would be a mistake to believe they and their collaborators cannot succeed a second time .
Consider :
On being chosen by Israel ’s President Shimon Peres to form the new regime , Likud ’s " Bibi " Netanyahu declared , " Iran is seeking to obtain a nuclear weapon and constitutes the gravest threat to our existence since the war of independence . "
Echoing Netanyahu , headlines last week screamed of a startling new nuclear breakthrough by the mullahs .
" Iran ready to build nuclear weapon , analysts say , " said CNN .
" Iran has enough uranium to make a bomb , " said the Los Angeles Times .
Armageddon appeared imminent .
Asked about Iran ’s nukes in his confirmation testimony , CIA Director Leon Panetta blurted , " From all the information I ’ve seen , I think there is no question that they are seeking that capability . "
Tuesday , Dennis Ross of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , a front spawned by the Israeli lobby AIPAC , was given the Iranian portfolio .
AIPAC ’s top agenda item ?
A U.S. collision with Iran .
In the neocon Weekly Standard , Elliot Abrams of the Bush White House parrots Netanyahu , urging Obama to put any land - for - peace deals with the Palestinians on a back burner .
Why ?
" The Israeli - Palestinian conflict is now part of a broader struggle in the region over Iranian extremism and power .
Israeli withdrawals now risk opening the door not only to Palestinian terrorists but to Iranian proxies . "
The campaign to conflate Hamas , Hezbollah and Syria as a new axis of evil , a terrorist cartel led by Iranian mullahs hell - bent on building a nuclear bomb and using it on Israel and America , has begun .
The full - page ads and syndicated columns calling on Obama to eradicate this mortal peril before it destroys us all cannot be far off .
But before we let ourselves be stampeded into another unnecessary war , let us review a few facts that seem to contradict the war propaganda .
First , last week ’s acknowledgement that Iran has enough enriched uranium for one atom bomb does not mean Iran is building an atom bomb .
To construct a nuclear device , the ton of low - enriched uranium at Natanz would have to be run through a second cascade of high - speed centrifuges to produce 55 pounds of highly enriched uranium ( HUE ) .
There is no evidence Iran has either created the cascade of high - speed centrifuges necessary to produce HUE or that Iran has diverted any of the low - enriched uranium from Natanz .
And the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors retain full access to Natanz .
And rather than accelerating production of low - enriched uranium , only 4,000 of the Natanz centrifuges are operating .
Some 1,000 are idle .
Why ?
Dr. Mohamed El - Baradei , head of the IAEA , believes this is a signal that Tehran wishes to negotiate with the United States , but without yielding any of its rights to enrich uranium and operate nuclear power plants .
For , unlike Israel , Pakistan and India , none of which signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and all of which ran clandestine programs and built atom bombs , Iran signed the NPT and has abided by its Safeguards Agreement .
What it refuses to accept are the broader demands of the U.N. Security Council because these go beyond the NPT and sanction Iran for doing what it has a legal right to do .
Moreover , Adm. Dennis Blair , who heads U.S. intelligence , has just restated the consensus of the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate that Iran does not now possess and is not now pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
Bottom line : Neither the United States nor the IAEA has conclusive evidence that Iran either has the fissile material for a bomb or an active program to build a bomb .
It has never tested a nuclear device and has never demonstrated a capacity to weaponize a nuclear device , if it had one .
Why , then , the hype , the hysteria , the clamor for " Action This Day ! " ?
It is to divert America from her true national interests and stampede her into embracing as her own the alien agenda of a renascent War Party .
None of this is to suggest the Iranians are saintly souls seeking only peace and progress .
Like South Korea , Japan and other nations with nuclear power plants , they may well want the ability to break out of the NPT , should it be necessary to deter , defend against or defeat enemies .
But that is no threat to us to justify war .
For decades , we lived under the threat that hundreds of Russian warheads could rain down upon us in hours , ending our national existence .
If deterrence worked with Stalin and Mao , it can work with an Iran that has not launched an offensive war against any nation within the memory of any living American .
Can we Americans say the same ?
The world ’s freshwater is under attack .
Privatization , pollution , damming , and drought will change the way we view our freshwater in the coming years .
According to Charity Water , one in six people on the planet do not have access to safe , clean drinking water .
In response to the growing struggle for safe , clean , free water a petition ( Article 31 ) to the United Nations has been started to make sure that water becomes a fundamental human right for all people .
… We believe the world will be a better place when the Right To Water is acknowledged by all nations as a fundamental human right , and that this addition to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights represents a major step toward the goal of water for all .

My father always said swearing was a sign of inarticulacy , but I just never fucking listened .
In my eyes , expletives are one of the pillars on which true cinema is founded , the other three being cigarettes , gelled quiffs and cute French girls .
Whether it 's uttered in surprise , anger or just with rock 'n ' roll nonchalance , a burst of profanity signals breakdown on the highway of language , where the handy screenwriter and the , er , wheeljack of character development really come into their own .
As for the other pillars : smoking is now verboten in the western world ; the gelled quiff has been hunted into near - extinction , the last surviving one seen fleetingly on The Culture Show ; luckily , cute French girls have not yet been legislated against .
And swearing ?
It 's getting its own documentaries , and even the once - peerless c-word has lost much of its power .
Swearing 's going legit , in other words .
Have they managed to take the fun out of that , too ?
Is nothing unsacred ?

And unlike the mountain ranges of f-words that loom up afterwards , it 's said with no malice ; pretty much meant literally .
2 ) " I 'm a mushroom cloud - laying motherfucker , motherfucker ! "
Extra points for brilliantly stunted vocabulary from Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary in Pulp Fiction ( 8 min 50sec ) – showcasing the delicate , twin nuances of a great American insult and perfectly befitting Jules Winnfield 's line in leather goods .
3 ) Hollywood 's not properly exploited the possibilities of cussing in foreign tongues – though digital windbag the Merovingian has some opinions on the use of French ( 1min 58sec ) for such matters in The Matrix Reloaded .
4 ) " You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries . "
There is indeed something to be learned from the French , and perhaps my dad was right , after all : the true lords of offence - giving , like the castle - dwellers in Monty Python and the Holy Grail , do n't even need bad language to stick it up 'em .

Japanese Hangover Cures :
Where is that Sake ?
The Japanese are known for many fine things including kabuki , geisha , sake , sake , and sake .
Since Japanese tradition calls for frequent drinking session between bosses and businessmen , getting trashed is a very common occurrence .
Hell , they even have their own unique expression for a hangover , which is â€œfutsukayoiâ€ , meaning , and â€œdrunk for two days.â€ 
( To be drunk for three days is â€œmikkayoiâ€  while drunk for four days is â€œyokkayoiâ€ ) .
Like their own drinking phrases , the Japanese have their own remedies for these conditions as well , most of which are fruit based .
â€ œGenki drinksâ€ are elixirs that are said to treat many conditions , including acute hammering in one ’s head .
Sold in convenience stores all over Japan , these small , 100 ml ( 3.38 fluid ounces ) glass bottles contain various potions said to cure or at least reduce the symptoms of common colds , loss of libido and hangovers .
But the Japanese are a very versatile lot , to say the least , and they know more than one way to stop the hammering .
One popular pre-emptive hangover cure is to eat ramen noodles after you finish drinking .
It is said that a bowl before going to sleep will nip the nastiest hangover right in the bud .
Another age - old Japanese remedy is miso soup , which is known to soothe the savage stomach and head .
Other remedies include drinking green tea , eating grated daikon or pushing pressure points .
Persimmons , also known as â€œkakiâ€  is good for a hangover because of “ their combination of fructose , vitamins A and C and minerals is the secretâ€ , says Metropolis Magazine .
Another natural remedy that has been utilized for centuries is kudzu , which is a kind of vine in the pea family .
Umeboshi pickled plums are also thought to relieve hangovers .
The pyric acid in umeboshi breaks down the booze in the body and restores the stomach to a life it can tolerate .
â€ œFor a normal hangover , bite off about a quarter of a plum and keep it in your mouth until it dissolves .
For a whopper hangover , herbalists recommend popping a whole plum into your mouth .
Continue to suck on it for about an hour after the plum has dissolved .
â€ – Asylum
Although we all know that anyone who drinks always runs the risk of drinking too much ; after all , we are only human .
There is , however , another alternative for hangovers that neither the legacy of ancient wisdom nor the perspective of modern thinking has touched upon .
It is very simple .
Do n’t drink so much !

Lobbyist drops suit over Times story suggesting McCain affair Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday February 19 , 2009
Print This Email This Last year , when the New York Times published a story which carried the concerns of Sen .
John McCain 's aides over his relationship with a female lobbyist , the Senator strongly objected , calling suggestions that he'd had an extra-marital affair " not true . "
However , the lobbyist , Vicki Iseman , filed a $ 27 million defamation suit against the paper .
On Thursday , that suit was dropped without settlement from the paper or alteration to the report : A victory for the New York Times and the story 's authors .
" Vicki Iseman has dropped her lawsuit against The Times , just weeks after it was filed , " wrote Times Washington bureau chief Dean Baquet in a memo to staff .
" We paid no money .
We did not apologize .
We did not retract one word of the story , which was a compelling chapter in the tale of Senator John McCain and his political rise . "
The story alleged some of Sen. McCain 's aides were " convinced the relationship had become romantic . . . and intervened to protect the candidate from himself . "
" The story stands as a powerful examination of a presidential candidate who cast himself as an ethics reformer and scourge of special interests , yet seemed blind at times over the course of his career to appearances of conflicts of interest , " continued Baquet .
" The article was the result of deep reporting , dozens of interviews and an abundance of caution .
I am as proud now of the work of the reporters -- David Kirkpatrick , Jim Rutenberg , Stephen Labaton , and Marilyn Thompson -- as I was the day it ran . "
All Iseman got out of the legal affair was a chance for her lawyers to invoke Shakespeare in defense of their client .
" Words have extraordinary power to wreak havoc on the life of a human being .
Shakespeare , writing in Othello that ' Good name in man and woman , dear my lord , Is the immediate jewel of their souls ' marked this essential link between our reputation and our humanity , " they wrote on The Times '
Web site .
" United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart , writing centuries later , asserted this same fundamental truth when he wrote that the individual 's right to protection of his or her good name ' reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being a concept at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty . ' "
" We stand by our coverage , and we are proud of it , " wrote Times Executive Editor Bill Keller in a published response to Iseman 's lawyers .
" The McCain campaign and some of its supporters set out aggressively to portray the article in question as a story about an unsubstantiated affair .
But it was not that , either explicitly or implicitly . "
New York Magazine called the whole ordeal a " fustercluck , " and captioned a photo of Iseman , " We 're beginning to really hate this lady . "
The Times said it would publish a note to readers about the Iseman suit in Friday 's edition .

As they pour you a screwdriver , I 'll wonder meekly if anyone would partake in merely a cup of orange juice .
Yes , the ice cube is still an option .
When one of them finds a terribly unsubtle reason to show off his tattoos , and the other a chance to flex his pop-culture muscles , toned from living in all ten years of the nineties ( LIVING ! IMAGINE THAT ! ) , I 'll briefly make eye contact with you and wonder what would happen if we were to meet under any other circumstances .
At the Art Institute , that custom Cupcakes place on Wellington , the cinema or maybe the street ( imagine that ! ) .
Then I remember , you always end up fucking my roommate , who 'll never talk to you again .
As a result , the next time you see me on the street , you 'll glare at me , and a little more of my self - esteem with get whittled away .
Too bad my roommates do n't suffer vicariously through me .
So , please .
Stop fucking my roommates .
For the love of God - do n't get drunk with them , do n't let them show you their tattoos , do n't sit next to them on the couch and shrug when they begin to drape their arm around you , do n't let them finger you , or go anywhere near your holiest of holies .
Show some goddamn restraint instead of becoming yet another notch on their beds .
The casualty list this month is nine or ten , I do n't really remember .
Stop fucking my roommates .
Stop fucking my roommates .
Stop fucking my roommates ( imagine it ! ) .
If you write that down , you 'll remember it better .
Do not fuck them , do not pass Go .
Go straight to low self esteem , yours and mine .
Stop fucking my roommates .
Thank you .

Car in late day spring fog • click to embiggenHoly s**t .
I never thought that I would live to see the day when anyone in the tech sector say " enough is enough " .
However , lo and behold , none other than Akira Watanabe , leader of Olympus ' SLR planning department , has declared :
Twelve megapixels is , I think , enough for covering most applications most customers need ...
We have no intention to compete in the megapixel wars for E - System ...
We do n't think 20 megapixels is necessary for everybody .
If a customer wants more than 12 megapixels , he should go to the full - frame models .
Instead , Watanab said Olympus will focus on other characteristics such as dynamic range , color reproduction , and a better ISO range for low - light shooting .
Halle -f** king - lujah !!!!
Something along the order of sanity reigns at Olympus .
That 's more than enough to make me want to go out and buy into the Olympus system ... no ... wait a minute ... I already have 3
Oly bodies ( 2 of which have been donated to the Cinemascapist cause ) and 4 Oly lenses .
Wow .
I just knew that my visionary decision to go Olympus when I moved into the dslr ranks was a good one .
All of that said , here 's the thing about my current Oly body - a 10 mp E3 .
As most of you know , I have been regularly making 24 × 24 inch prints from the 10 mp files made with that camera .
The prints are no -excuses - needed stunningly very nice .
IMO , based on 40 years experience in the picturing business , is that they rival , in look and quality , prints made from 2 1/4 ( 120 ) film based cameras .
Maybe , just maybe , a tad better in some respects .
What they are not is that they are not the pinnacle of absolute sharpness that is possible from APS - sized sensor cameras .
However , I do n't see this as a deficiency because , when viewed at a proper distance - the distance from which a viewer can see and get the whole picture - or even at a closer distance that is outside of pixel - peeping range , the prints are way more than sharp enough .
That is to say ( and not damning with faint praise ) that the prints are very sharp - just not as sharp as the current state of the art for non full - frame sensors .
BUT , here 's the most important thing - the look and feel of the prints is ideally suited to visually complimenting / supporting what I am trying to say with my pictures .
Here 's how I look at it - I think of my Oly as my medium format camera ( as judged by traditional analog photography standards ) .
I think of my Pentax K20D as my 4×5 - 8×10ish view camera ( as judged by traditional analog photography standards ) .
If I were to own a FF sensor camera , I would probably have to think of it as something beyond being able to be judged by traditional analog photography standards .
Each of these " formats " ( all of which are delivered in traditional analog 35 mm camera bodies ) deliver different - from - one - another look and feel prints .
To my eyes and my sensibilities , each sensor format when printed at 13 " ×19 " and larger presents a different enough visual impression that it can effect an astute viewer 's perception - visual and intellectual / emotional - of a picture .
Without getting too in - depth , I look at the difference this way - the smaller sensor format 's visual footprint suits the making of pictures that are more " spontaneous " or " casual " in nature or , at least , where the intent is for them to appear to be so .
The larger sensor format 's look and feel is more suited to making pictures that are more " formal " in nature - pictures that are or appear to be more " studied " in both their making and their meaning (s ) .
In actual picture terms , think of it as the difference between , as an example , the landscape pictures of the Landscapist and those of Ansel Adams .
Or , as the difference between the tableuax vivants pictures of the Cinemascapist and those of Gregory Crewdson .
IMO , the point that the pixel - peeper idiots miss is that , sure enough , sensor size matters - each delivers a different look and feel in pretty much the same manner as different film format cameras did / do - but , choosing to use one sensor format or another should be a matter of using those those differences as determined by what you are trying to express , not whether one sensor format or another is better based on tech specs .
At times , bigger is better , more dynamic range is better , more sharpness is better , and so on .
But , at other times , it simply is n't so .
IMO , the choice of which way to go all depends on using the tool that gets the results you want / need in order to say what you want to say .
That 's the reason that commercial photogs , especially those in the cosmetics world , who need pictures of eyelashes , hair , skin , etc. to be smooth as silk and sharp as a tack , wo n't even touch a FF - sensor 20 mp +
Nikon / Canon / Sony camera .
The look and feel they need can only be had by using medium format 40 mp + cameras .
BTW & FYI , one more reason I applaud this 12 mp limit idea is that everything I use to process and print 10 - 14 mp picture files - my computer ( AKA , my image processing power ) , my RAM , my hard drive space for storage , my memory cards , etc. - is currently operating at peak efficiency .
If I were to move to the next level of mp files ( 20 mp and up ) , everything would have to change .
And , of course , all of those changes would come at great expense and , I would guarantee , at great aggravation as well .
So , kudos to Olympus for putting on the brakes .
And I 'll be acquiring one of their 12 mp bodies soon enough .
UPDATE : The sale of MYMMOshop.com to MY MMO Inc. has recently been called into question .
We are investigating this .
The web site MyMMOshop.com has been sold to My MMO Inc. for a whopping $ 10 million dollars .
This is an extraordinary amount for a website , and in a recession no less !
We decided to take a look at the value of this site is in VIRTUAL terms to see how much the site would be worth in the world ’s currencies that they trade ( see spreadsheet below ) .
My MMO
Shop sells virtual currency , in markets with high demand .
It is very similar to the currency exchange market in terms of the way they operate , except the the economy is a ficticious one rather than the real world economy .
The site sells virtual currencies from some of the biggest online multiplayer games in the world , and is considered to be in the top 3 “ real money trading ( RMT ) ” websites in the world .
These Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games ( MMORPGs ) have real world virtual economies behind them with .
The company has succceeded with two important tenants : 1 . strong anti-fraud initiatives including requiring voice authorization .
2 . Excellent 24/7 customer service .
These important points have helped to make the site a leader in the space .
There economies are substantial , with each currencies essentially ‘ trading ’ against US dollars or Euros .
Real money trading has not been looked on kindly by MMORPG communities and developers .
The purchasing of virtual currency was widely regarded as an unfair advantage to those who had spent a lot of time to develop accounts .
Capitalism has prevailed though for good or ill though , the trend has caught on , with the GDP of some games eclipsing those of small countries .
Serious gamers now spend thosands of dollars per year to equip their gamers in the now $ 2 BILLION dollar industry ( that ’s a lot of WOW gold ) .
The creation of Sony ’s own RMT site – Station Cash – has helped to bring legitimacy to the industry that is proving to be recession proof .
As big fans of currency trading ourselves , we decided to take a bit deeper look at the conversion rates
So we decided to run some quick calculations to see just how much MyMMOSHop would cost in the games they are trading currencies for .
Here ’s what we came up with :
Our two favorites – the site would cost :
$ 391,696,043,869,957.00
Eve ISK’s
and
$ 17,110,981,828,137.30
Star Wars Credits
** Pricing is based on information from MyMMOShop pricing for highest volume of currency available .

Consumers and businesses are being more careful with their money now , but they are still buying software if it will save them time and / or money .
If you have been laid off in the current recession , perhaps now is a good time to start that microISV you have been thinking about .
But starting your own business can be a bit daunting if you have n’t done it before .
What is actually involved in the day to day running of a small software business ?
Disclaimer :
The information below is based on my my experience of running a microISV as a UK - based limited company for 4 years .
It is far from comprehensive and is merely intended to give you some pointers .
I am not an accountant .
I am not a lawyer .
Some of the information will not be relevant to businesses based outside the UK .
Seek appropriate professional advice .
Accountants
Probably the first thing you should do when you decide to go into business is to get an accountant .
An accountant will be able to advise you on bookkeeping , tax , VAT , company rules and regulations and any number of other topics .
As you are n’t a large or publicly listed company they do n’t have to be a chartered accountant .
Changing accountant later may be painful , so try to get it right first time .
Ideally try to find your accountant by personal recommendation and someone you think you will get on with .
Everything can be done by phone and email , so they do n’t have to be in the same town .
Setting up a company
You do n’t have to have a company .
But it does have some advantages :
It makes it easier to separate your personal and business finances , which can only be a good thing .
It gives you some legal protection .
If someone decides to sue due to a bug in your software , they will have to sue your company , rather than you personally .
So you have less chance of losing your house .
It has some tax advantages .
You can impress members of the opposite sex by putting ‘ Director ’ on your business card .
Having a company also has certain obligations , such as filing annual returns and company accounts .
Much of it can now be done online .
The company annual return is pretty straightforward .
You just need to list who the company officers and shareholders are .
The tax return is more complicated and something I would n’t want to do without the help of an accountant .
Setting up a limited company in the UK is fairly easy , simple and cheap .
In theory you could read all the necessary documents and do all the paperwork yourself .
But surely there are better uses of your time when you can get an accountant to do it for you for as little as £ 90 .
Banking
When you choose a bank you need to consider :
Charges – per month and per transaction .
Services – e.g. foreign currency accounts .
Customer service – how long will you have to wait on the phone to speak to someone ?
Convenience – you do n’t want to have to drive to the next town to pay in a cheque .
Interest – are their rates competitive ?
Guarantees – is the money guaranteed if the bank goes bust ?
It may also be a good idea to choose a separate bank from your personal bank , to keep your business and personal finances separate .
This could also be important if you ever got into a dispute with your bank .
Having had very good experiences with HSBC through FirstDirect , I chose HSBC for my business banking .
However I was unimpressed by the service I received .
This included queuing 40 minutes to pay in a cheque and calls to the branch 2 miles away being routed via India ( I got fed up of spelling out H - i - g - h W - y - c - o - m - b- e ) .
I was also irked by the service charges .
£ 0.60 to pay in a cheque !
When I told them what I thought of their service they made an appointment for someone to come and see me .
They never turned up .
No apology , nothing .
I have since switched my banking to Alliance and Leicester business bank .
I have been happy with the service and there are no charges as long as you pay in at least £ 1,000 per month .
I can also pay in cheques at any Post Office ( if the UK government does n’t close them all ) .
Invoices
If you are selling to other companies , rather than just consumers , you will have to deal with invoices .
Invoices are a subject of mystery to many developers , but really they are just a note to someone that they owe you money .
In theory the sequence is :
Customer asks for a quote .
You send a quote ( include an expiry date ) .
Customer sends a signed purchase order .
You send the software licence key with an invoice .
Customer pays the invoice within the time specified by the invoice .
Yeah , right .
In reality many companies pay months late .
This helps to improve their cash flow at your expense .
But , according to Hanlon ’s razor , one should ‘ Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity ’ and I am sure that the apathy and incompetence of accounting staff is also a large factor .
The invoice itself is nothing special .
It should include :
The word ‘ INVOICE ’ in large letters .
Your company details ( including your VAT details , if registered ) .
A unique invoice number .
The date .
Customer details , including their purchase order number .
A description of the product sold and the price ( including the currency ) .
Details of how to pay , e.g. your SWIFT / IBAN code and / or who to make the cheque payable to .
The payment terms ( typically 30 days ) .
You might want to number your first invoice 0100 , rather 0001 , if you do n’t want early customers to know you are a newbie .
Dealing with the late payment of invoices is a whole topic on it ’s own .
Personally I do n’t invoice for payments of < £ 100 or $ 200 – it just is n’t worth the hassle .
And I always pay my bills on time .
It is the right thing to do .
Bookkeeping
Do n’t fight the system , you ca n’t win .
Computing is < 70 years old .
Accounting is as old as recorded history .
Suck it up and learn the appropriate terminology .
Consider doing a class on basic bookkeeping .
An accountant is not a bookkeeper .
They may agree to do your bookkeeping , but it is likely to be expensive .
Personally , I do my own bookkeeping .
It is a bit tedious , but it means I know exactly where every penny goes and I can listen to a podcast at the same time to alleviate the boredom .
I started off using Excel for my bookkeeping .
In retrospect this was a mistake .
You are on your own when it comes to generating reports , such as profit and loss .
Mistakes are easy to make and hard to find in large Excel spreadsheets .
Excel does n’t scale very well to hundreds or thousands of transactions .
Your custom Excel spreadsheet is much more difficult ( =expensive ) for your accountant to work with than the package he normally uses .
Sales receipts , advertising , salary , dividends , ISPs , postage , stationery , professional fees etc. can add up to a lot of transactions .
Even with sales batched up into weekly blocks , a one man business such as mine can easily generate over 600 transactions a year .
You really do n’t want to be trying to track all this in Excel .
Much better to use a purpose - built accounting package .
The market leading package for small businesses worldwide appears to be Intuit Quickbooks .
Others are Sage ( popular in the UK ) and MYOB .
I recommend you chose whatever package your accountant is happiest to work with .
Get your accountant to set it up for you .
Trying to use a personal finance package , such as Microsoft money , to run a business is almost certainly a bad idea .
I switched from Excel to Intuit QuickBooks .
Initially I hated it .
But once I accepted that it was written for bookkeepers , not software developers , we reached a grudging acceptance of each other .
Now I just spend an hour or so updating Quickbooks every 1 - 2 weeks and making sure it tallies with my bank statements .
I then send my accountant a copy of the database at the end of each financial year .
He then uses this data to create the company annual accounts and tax return .
Do n’t leave the bookkeeping until the end of the tax year .
You will end up with hundred of scraps of paper to match up with hundreds of transactions .
This is an N^2 problem .
As with any polynomial problem , you should try to keep N small .
Also , your accountant has lots of other clients and wo n’t thank you for asking him to create your annual report by midnight to meet the filing deadline .
Try to get a receipt for everything .
I number receipts sequentially , write that number on the receipt and include it in the Quickbooks transaction memo .
I then file the paper receipt in a folder partitioned by month .
This should mean that I can easily find the appropriate receipt if ( when ? )
I get audited by the tax man .
In my experience it is common to be invoiced for the wrong amount or twice for the same things .
Some companies will even try it on by invoicing you for things you did n’t agree to buy .
So check every incoming invoice .
Companies do n’t appear to put their best , brightest and most cooperative in the accounts department .
Get used to it .
Managing cash flow is a huge issue for businesses .
Any number of healthy and profitable businesses have gone to the wall due to cash flow problems .
This should n’t be an issue for most microISVs as we do n’t have to spend a large proportion of our income on equipment or maintain expensive inventories .
Hooray for software .
Currencies
I accept payment in various currencies through PayPal .
PayPal charge a 2 % fee for converting these payments to pounds sterling on top of their other fees .
I have previously looked into opening a US dollar account , but it did n’t seem worth the hassle or expense .
The Alliance and Leicester Bank charge a £ 10 fee to cash a cheque in US dollars .
Tax
MicroISVs , like other one - man limited companies , typically pay themselves a minimal salary ( around 5 k per year ) and the rest as dividends .
This means that no income tax is payable on your salary .
Instead you pay corporation tax on the dividends .
As corporation tax is typically lower than basic rate income tax , this is more tax efficient .
However you still have to pay higher rate income tax if your income exceeds the higher rate income tax threshold .
Whenever I pay a dividend I transfer the amount of corporation tax that will be due on the profit to my business reserve account .
At the end of the tax year I then know I have enough in this account to pay my corporation tax .
If you sell more than £ 67 k per year ( currently ) of goods inside the EU you must register for VAT .
If you sell less than this , registering for VAT is optional .
Advantages of registering for VAT :
You can claim back VAT on all purchases .
Not having a VAT number may make you seem ‘ not a real business ’ to other businesses .
Disadvantages of registering for VAT :
You have to charge VAT on all sales inside the EU .
Businesses can claim this back , but consumers can’t .
More paperwork .
Consequently a B2C software vendor with large profit margins probably should n’t register until they have to .
But VAT registration might be much more attractive to a B2B software vendor with lots of expenses .
Apparently you can claim back some of your VAT payments retrospectively when you register .
Some other points on tax :
You can give your spouse shares in the company and pay them that proportion of the dividends .
This is tax efficient if they earn less then you .
But will only add to your woes if they ever run off with the milkman / milkwoman .
When you are applying for a mortgage some banks will only count your salary , not your dividends .
A £ 5 k salary does n’t go far , even in the current housing market .
If you work at home you can charge a percentage of your heating , electricity , council tax etc or rent part of the house to your company .
But you may then be liable to pay capital gains tax on any increase in value of the house .
In the UK you can claim £ 55 per week tax - free in childcare vouchers .
The childcare provider must be registered with OFSTED .
You do n’t need a physical paper voucher – just pay the childcare provider direct from your company and keep all the appropriate records ( including their OFSTED number ) .
The UK government pays a reasonable rate of interest on early payments of corporation tax .
You might get more interest paying your corporation tax early than leaving it in a savings account .
Also you do n’t have to worry about the bank going under with your savings .
Of course you will still have to pay tax on the interest next year .
I have also written an article on the basics of VAT for software vendors .

This view , released by Russia 's Federal Space Agency , reveals the living quarters of the planned Mars500 simulated mission to Mars .
Before humans actually go to Mars , six people willpretend to go first .
The European Space Agency ( ESA ) and the Russian Institutefor Biomedical Problems ( IBMP ) recently announced the crew for the first phaseof their joint Mars500 mock mission .
Starting March 31 , the selected adventurers will spend 105 days in isolation , as if they were really journeying to the red planet .
They will simulate abbreviatedperiods of travel to and from Mars , as well as a stay on the Martian surface .
All the while , scientists from a mock control center willwatch what happens to the crewmembers ?
levels of stress , hormone regulation , immunity , sleep quality , mood and diet .
? We want to learn about the effect of isolation onperformance , behavior , and interaction within the group , ? said ESA Mars500 program manager Jennifer Ngo - Anh .
?
Hopefully , we will test counter measures andthings like remote medical assistance , tele - medical equipment .?
Out of 5,600 applicants , ESA chose two prime crewmembers , and two backup .
The prime team is Oliver Knickel , a mechanical engineer in the German army , and French airline pilot Cyrille Fournier .
Cedric Mabilotte and Arc'hanmael Gaillard , both from France , will serve as backup crewmembers .
The European crew will join four Russian crewmates : cosmonautsOleg Artemyev and Sergei Ryazansky , medical doctor Alexei Baranov , and sportsphysiologist Alexei Shpakov .
?
Right now the team is really motivated andharmonious , ?
Ngo - Anh told SPACE.com .
?
They ?re a really good team .
Ideally , there ?ll be no problems , but we ?ll see .?
If problems do arise in the isolation facility , locatedoutside Moscow , the crew will try to handle it themselves , with help from themission controllers .
Contact between the crew and the control center will havea 20 - minute delay , to simulate the communications lag a real mission wouldexperience .
For the duration of the mission , the crew will only havepersonal contact with each other , and voice contact with mission controllers , familyand friends .
While in isolation , the team will follow a similarschedule to that of International Space Station ( ISS ) astronauts , with work , rest and exercise .
They will even eat the same food as the ISS astronauts .
The Mars500 crewmembers will be paid 15,500 euros ( $ 20,000 ) each for their participation .
The mock Mars expedition reportedly costs about $ 15 million .
Later in 2009 , an extended 520 - day mission will begin , including the 250 - day one - way trip to Mars , a 30 - day stay on its surface , and the 240 - day return flight .
The team for that longer experiment has not yet beenchosen .
SPIEGEL Interview with Bishop Richard Williamson ' I Will Not Travel to Auschwitz '
Bishop Richard Williamson 's denial of the Holocaust has done serious damage to the Catholic Church .
In an e-mail and fax exchange with SPIEGEL , the ultra - conservative bishop says that he is willing to " review the historical evidence . "
JERUSALEM , Feb 16 ( Reuters ) - Israeli firm Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd. said on Monday it had won $ 22 million in contracts to supply Mexico 's federal police with airborne surveillance systems .
Products sold include the Skystar 300 , a blimp with onboard cameras offering 24 - hour monitoring of surroundings , and the Orbiter , a miniature unmanned spy plane , Aeronautics said in a statement .

In October 2007 , I wrote about “ Facebook Demographics Direct From Their System ” that gave an account of Facebook ’s demographic composition using a few statistics that might be interesting to marketers .
Ten months later , we followed up with “ Facebook Demographics 2008 Update – It ’s Getting Older In There ” which showed that the fastest growing group , the 35 - 54 year old segment , grew at a rate of 172.9 % in that period .
Below is our third granular examination of Facebook ’s demographics and statistics directly from their Social Ads platform .
The biggest surprise ( perhaps it should n’t be surprising ) was that Facebook ’s 35 - 54 year old demographic segment not only continued to grow the fastest , but it accelerated to a 276.4 % growth rate over the past 6 months .
That demo is DOUBLING roughly every two months .
Here ’s the full breakdown :
Download 2009 Facebook Demographics and Statistics as an Excel spreadsheet
Top Insights :
1 ) The 35 - 54 year old demo is growing fastest , with a 276.4 % growth rate in over the approximate 6 months since we last produced this report
2 ) The 55 + demo is not far behind with a 194.3 % growth rate
3 ) The 25 - 34 year population on Facebook is doubling every 6 months
4 ) For those interested in advertising alcohol on Facebook , there are 27,912,480 users 21 + , representing 66.3 % of all users
5 ) Miami is the fastest growing metropolitan area ( 88.5 % ) and Atlanta ( 6.4 % ) is the slowest
6 ) There are more females ( 55.7 % ) than males ( 42.2 % ) on Facebook – 2.2 % are of unknown gender .
7 ) The largest demographic concentration remains the college crowd of 18 - 24 year olds ( 40.8 % ) which is down from ( 53.8 % ) six months ago .
Take away ?
Parents and professionals are rapidly adopting Facebook .
Should a marketer be concerned about this shift if they ’re focused on youth marketing ?
No .
Facebook ’s ad targeting enables zero waste from an age targeting perspective .
Additionally , Facebook Pages now have an age restriction feature .
What I think we ’ll see in 2009 is a flurry of alcohol marketing as Facebook approaches a critical 70 % concentration of legal drinking aged users .
The 21 + demo should reach that 70 % mark at the end of Q1 .
The alcohol category does pretty well in recessionary times after all !
Not only are homemade beauty supplies less expensive , they ’re better for you and for the planet .
Try these DIY beauty recipes !
Conventional beauty products often contain harmful additives to increase lather or give the product a creamy texture .
Ingredients like Sodium Lauryl / Laureth Sulfate ( SLS ) , for example , are in pretty much every skin- and hair - care product .
SLS is a known mutagen and skin irritant and is even a suspected carcinogen !
Even many natural products even contain some of the more toxic beauty industry chemicals .
You can keep harsh chemicals off of your skin and out of the environment by making DIY beauty supplies at home !
1. Instead of buying plastic razors or toxic hair removers , you might give sugaring a try !
Sugaring is an inexpensive way to remove unwanted hair that is n’t as painful as wax removal .
2 . You can exfoliate and moisturize with this home made sugar scrub .
This recipe is fun because it ’s really flexible !
You can experiment with different base oils and essential oils for all sorts of great - smelling outcomes !
Check out the comments for a really festive alternative that you might want to crib for the holidays .
3. Pioneer Thinking has a great , simple shampoo recipe .
I gave this DIY beauty recipe a whirl and found it really easy to adapt .
The only ingredient you do n’t want to mess with is the veggie glycerin .
You can use different teas for different results , like a peppermint tea to make it more invigorating .
Instead of the pure soap flakes , I grabbed all those useless , tiny soap ends that had accumulated in our shower , tossed them in the blender , and those worked perfectly !
You can also add essential oil , like tea tree or sandalwood , to this mix .
Not only does it work great as a shampoo , I ’ve been using it as a face and body wash .
Since it does n’t have chemicals to make it frothy , you will need to use more of it than the conventional shampoo .
It ’s so much cheaper than store bought , though , that you still win in the end !
4 . It ’s really easy to make your own perfume !
Just mix around 40 drops of your favorite essential oil in a 2 ounce spray bottle full of rubbing alcohol .
To turn this into a deodorant recipe , use oils that have antiseptic qualities , like tea tree or sage .
Do you make any of your own bath and body products ?

I have been exchanging emails with a dominant I had approached with the intent of getting to know him a little better .
I got several brushbacks .
He found me “ intimidating ” somehow … but never elaborated on what that meant .
He does n’t play casually , because his play partners tend to “ fall for him ” so rather than risk that , he avoids playing up until mutual levels of interest are met .
Well , OK , whatever works , right ?
Then I got the serious emotional bean ball : the suckerpunch of being told I ’m “ not the type ” he is usually attracted to … but my scintillating intellect intrigued him to the point where he considered the chance to get to know me a rare treat .
A singular indulgence for his own formidable intellect .
Thanks .
I want nothing more than to be your Scheherazade while you go off being ego - stroked by the hordes of swooning submissives who ARE your type , even if their conversation , realness , intelligence and demeanor are no match for mine .
Srsly ?
You wanna admire my wit ?
Read my fucking blogs .
You want repartee ?
Subscribe to my goddamned Twitter feed .
I need to be lusted after and ravished by a Man Who Wants Nothing More Than To Own Me .
Not a sparkly psychic bauble .
Not your mental whetstone .
My last long - term relationship was with a guy who would stop everything he was doing and fuck my brains out when he saw me naked .
He thought my body was absolutely perfect .
Oh and hey !
He ADDITIONALLY admired my intelligence .
Fancy that .
Too bad he was intimidated by my history as a kinkster .
It took me 3 years to pass through that relationship .
But that is another story for another day .
I am pleased my turnaround time on weeding out mismatched partners is improving .
Exponentially .
SO , back to the current issue …
After many MANY conversational miscues and missteps that left me feeling a bit battered , I closed my last communication with this prospective date thusly :
I value myself FAR to highly to be shoe - horned among the swooning mass of women with whom you wo n’t play because they “ fall for you . ”
I have been around the dungeon enough times to know that someone who is still sleeping with an ex “ because they are fluid bonded ” is not someone who is fully emotionally and physically and spiritually available .
I am not at all interested in waiting and hoping for the day you have the gumption and / or desire to let go of your ex and move on .
I will not compete with other women for your time .
I am free , unencumbered , emotionally available and have the ovaries to live alone and walk alone until someone who wants me as I am , and who appreciates all that I am comes along .
I am certainly not going to cobble together a scant meal from the crumbs and leavings of someone else ’s table .
That is what you are offering me right now .
I wish I felt as strong as those words sound … because right now I feel lonely .
But I do n’t feel lonely enough to fucking queue up for a man-raffle .
In our work with government data we encourage governments to develop great looking websites with fantastic APIs .
But you ca n’t have true transparency unless you go all the way down to the source giving citizens access to the raw bulk data .
Take for instance , USAspending.gov often lauded by our community as a great boon to transparency .
It certainly was a great leap forward– the website gives citizens access to descriptions of federal contracts has XML feeds , and a great search engine .
But take a look at this $ 375,000 expenditure by the Department of the Navy to make Facebook “ sites ” .
On the surface , this is pretty incredible but since I have a summary of the contract , not the actual contract , I ca n’t see what actually went on here .
It is pretty easy to make some harsh conclusions .
Before you rush to judgement though , ask some key questions : what are the technical specifications of the project , is it really just Facebook ?
Was it for advertising ?
Who authorized the purchase ?
Was there hardware purchased ?
Was it to buy a license that is valid for other things ?
What does it mean by “ NAVY OFFICER FACEBOOK SITES , ” because I did n’t spend any money on my Facebook site .
In all likelihood this is an advertising expenditure .
But to get that , I probably have to FOIA for it which can take time and money and could just not happen .
Despite USASpending providing an adequate API , XML feeds , CSV files , and a nice search engine , it is n’t adequate enough because the raw data is n’t available .
Without the raw data , it is n’t transparent ( or disclosed ) .
The interesting thing is that with the raw data , the rest of the stuff can be built by non government types ( like for instance , us ! ) in ways that may provide an interesting take on the data that Government ca n’t or wo n’t provide .
This is very clearly what our friends over at OpenSecrets.org do .
They take data from the Federal Election Committee and combine it with sector and industry codes and provide quality control that makes searching through OpenSecrets data a more informative experience than looking at the FEC data on FEC.gov .
Government should be providing us access to data in three steps :
First , give us bulk access to the data in its rawest form .
Give us scanned images of checks and contracts .
Give us the campaign contribution information as it comes in from the campaigns at the FEC ( they do ! ) .
Second , give us machine readable APIs so that we can take the data and mash it up with data across agencies .
Finally , create a user experience that allows non-technical citizens to access the data .
But if you start with providing a website and do n’t provide bulk data access or an API ( like for instance , THOMAS ) then we ’ve got to go through the effort of parsing all the pages using something like BeautifulSoup to turn them into things like OpenCongress.org .
What a drag !
I would n't call Christ a con artist , he preached against the greed of organised religion and said that you did n't have to be in a church to love your God , which was got him killed in the end .
Modern Christianity really does n't reflect Christ 's words as I understand them .
I also personally have the belief that all the religious books are written around the same principles but colloquially they differ .
For example who Europeans call God , Muslims would call Allah and Jew's Jehovah .
Who knows eh ?
Maybe I 'm wrong .

If you look at a lot of founding principles in religion they served a purpose , they may not be as important in this day - and - age but they were then .
For example , Jewish people not eating shellfish : my take on this is that it 's very unsafe to eat bad shellfish and before refrigeration there 's every chance it would go off quickly !
So ' God says avoid ' gets through and spares life .
The same can be said for other do's and dont's .

VENEZUELAN OIL : Controversial but free program in 3rd year .
With heating oil prices approaching $ 10 a gallon in rural Alaska and reports of neighbors stealing fuel from neighbors to warm their homes , a Venezuela - owned oil company plans to supply free fuel to villages again this winter .
That 's what a Citgo executive who oversees the company 's free heating oil program told the Alaska Inter - Tribal Council earlier this month , said council director Steve Osborne .
Citgo has provided roughly 15,000 Alaska village households 100 gallons of heating oil each for the past two winters .
If the company donates the same amount this year , some families will save as much as $ 1,000 on their fuel bills .
It 's part of a program providing assistance to low - income communities in 23 states .

The Obama administration was supposed to bring a new era of accountability and transparency to Washington .
But two nonprofits are complaining that the new President is taking the Bush administration line — at least for now — on a big issue : what to do ( or not to do ) about millions of missing White House emails .
The day after Obama was sworn in as President , the Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss a case brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) and the National Security Archive .
The two watchdogs want to force the administration to prove that it has recovered all missing emails and has taken steps to prevent any more emails from being lost .
Last Friday , the Obama administration missed a deadline to withdraw its motion .
“ If they did n’t want to litigate this , they would have withdrawn or asked to hold their motion , ” says Anne Weismann , CREW ’s chief counsel .
“ I would have taken that as a sign of good faith . ”
When asked about the Obama administration ’s apparent adoption of the Bush strategy at Monday ’s White House press briefing , press secretary Robert Gibbs said , “ This administration and this presidency seek a different amount of transparency than Washington has seen , ” and quipped , “ Dare I say email the Justice Department ” about the seeming disconnect .
But other administration officials were adamant that they could not comment about pending litigation .
It could be that the administration is working behind the scenes to settle the case , as the Clinton administration did when the NSA sued it in the early 1990s .
The plaintiffs would certainly be open to the prospect : Weismann told Mother Jones that her organization “ would be very open to an interest on their part to settle this lawsuit . ”
But so far , Weismann says , she has n’t noticed “ a difference ” from the Bush administration ’s legal strategy .
“ When we approached them about the possibility of finding a non-litigation way to resolve this , the response so far has been opposition , ” she said .
But the Obama team ’s moves in this case so far echo Bush administration ’s strategy .
In its motion to dismiss , the White House claims that missing emails are already being recovered and the suit is no longer necessary — exactly the same claim the Bush White House made throughout the second half of 2008 .
But the plaintiffs say that the efforts the White House has taken are still insufficient .
“ The motion that they filed suggests some activity but it definitely does n’t suggest sufficient activity to save the emails , ” says Meredith Fuchs , the general counsel for the National Security Archive .
The National Security Archive has sued every president since Reagan over email archiving .
In its latest filing ( PDF ) , the National Security Archive calls the motion to dismiss “ no more than the latest in a long series of stonewalling tactics , which a less charitable litigant might characterize as a cover - up . ”
The plaintiffs claim that the issue at the heart of the lawsuit is the very transparency Gibbs said Obama wants to bring to Washington .
After all , the plaintiffs have struggled for months to find out exactly what the White House has done to recover missing emails ( perhaps millions ) and prevent further losses .
The little information that has emerged in court filings has not given the National Security Archive or CREW much comfort .
“ We have no assurance that the Obama administration is now using an appropriate method to archive emails , ” Weismann says .
“ Do they intend , in the near future , to put in place a new record - keeping system ?
I would hope so , but I do n’t know that for a fact .
They have n’t told us anything . ”
Fuchs says it ’s hard for the plaintiffs to determine how close the White House is to having an appropriate , legally compliant archiving system without more disclosure : “ It ’s conceivable that what they ’ve done is 95 percent of the way there .
It ’s conceivable it ’s 50 percent of the way there .
It ’s conceivable it ’s almost nothing .
But we have so little information about what they ’ve done , it ’s very difficult for us to assess whether emails are safe at this point . ”
The bottom line , she says , is that , “ from what we ’ve read [ in White House legal filings ] , we believe emails are still at risk and still have not been restored . ”
Stephen King Gets Plowed ; Tells it Like it Is
Stephen King is drinking again : USA Weekend Magazine : " Did you know J.K .
Rowling used to read your books when she was growing up and says you were an influence ?
" Stephen King : ( sluuuurp ) " I think that has some kind of formative influence the same way reading Richard Matheson had an influence on me .
People always say to me , ' Well , what about H.P. Lovecraft ? "
And the thing was , you read Lovecraft when you were a kid but I never felt that he was speaking my language .
It was chillier than my heart was , and when Matheson started to write about ordinary people and stuff , that was something that I wanted to do .
I said , ' This is the way to do it .
He 's showing the way . '
I think that I serve that purpose for some writers , and that 's a good thing .
Both Rowling and Meyer , they 're speaking directly to young people ...
The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn .
She 's not very good .
" ( He lights a cigarette : " Have n't had one of these in a dog 's age . " )
" Somebody who 's a terrific writer who 's been very , very successful is Jodi Picoult .
You 've got Dean Koontz , who can write like hell .
And then sometimes he 's just awful .
It varies .
James Patterson is a terrible writer but he 's very very successful .
People are attracted by the stories , by the pace and in the case of Stephenie Meyer , it 's very clear that she 's writing to a whole generation of girls and opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books .
It 's exciting and it 's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because they 're not overtly sexual .
A lot of the physical side of it is conveyed in things like the vampire will touch her forearm or run a hand over skin , and she just flushes all hot and cold .
And for girls , that 's a shorthand for all the feelings that they 're not ready to deal with yet .

Frequently Asked Questions about the Public Debt
General Information
Where is the money spent that is borrowed from the public and who decides where it goes ?
The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is responsible for accounting for and reporting the debt in accordance with statutory direction .
The Bureau does not have any public policy decision - making authority .
Visit our financial management web site for more information .
Information about the " Budget of the United States " is available at the Government Printing Office web site .
What is the difference between the debt and the deficit ?
The deficit is the fiscal year difference between what the United States Government ( Government ) takes in from taxes and other revenues , called receipts , and the amount of money the Government spends , called outlays .
The items included in the deficit are considered either on - budget or off - budget .
You can think of the total debt as accumulated deficits plus accumulated off - budget surpluses .
The on - budget deficits require the U.S. Treasury to borrow money to raise cash needed to keep the Government operating .
We borrow the money by selling securities like Treasury bills , notes , bonds and savings bonds to the public .
The Treasury securities issued to the public and to the Government Trust Funds ( Intragovernmental Holdings ) then become part of the total debt .
For information about the deficit , visit the financial management web site to view the Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government ( MTS ) .
What 's the difference between the Public Debt Outstanding and the Public Debt Subject to Limit ?
The Public Debt Outstanding represents the face amount or principal amount of marketable and non-marketable securities currently outstanding .
The Public Debt Subject to Limit is the maximum amount of money the Government is allowed to borrow without receiving additional authority from Congress .
Furthermore , the Public Debt Subject to Limit is the Public Debt Outstanding adjusted for Unamortized Discount on Treasury Bills and Zero Coupon Treasury Bonds , Miscellaneous debt ( very old debt ) , Debt held by the Federal Financing Bank and Guaranteed Debt .
Why does the debt only change once a day ?
Why does n't Treasury keep a rolling tab ?
Our current accounting system produces the Public Debt Outstanding amount daily .
Our system relies on reporting entities ( for example , Federal Reserve Banks ) to report a variety of Treasury security information at the end of the day .
On the following business day , our accounting system processes this information and generates the Public Debt Outstanding for the previous day which is posted to our website by 3 PM .
Although we continually look for methods to improve our process , daily accounting is still the most effective , efficient , and accurate way to account for the debt .
Makeup of the Debt
Is there a report that lists the type of Treasury Securities that are issued to finance the debt , related maturity dates , and " Amount Outstanding ? "
The Monthly Statement of the Public Debt ( MSPD ) is available online in summary and full versions , and lists the types of Treasury Securities issued to finance the Debt , the related maturity dates , and the " Amount Outstanding " .
Ownership of the Debt
Who owns the debt ?
The Treasury Bulletin , available at our financial management website categorizes ownership of U.S. Government securities by types of investors .
What is the Debt Held by the Public ?
The Debt Held by the Public is all federal debt held by individuals , corporations , state or local governments , Federal Reserve Banks , foreign governments , and other entities outside the United States Government less Federal Financing Bank securities .
Types of securities held by the public include , but are not limited to , Treasury Bills , Notes , Bonds , TIPS , United States Savings Bonds , and State and Local Government Series securities .
What are Intragovernmental Holdings ?
Intragovernmental Holdings are Government Account Series securities held by Government trust funds , revolving funds , and special funds ; and Federal Financing Bank securities .
A small amount of marketable securities are held by government accounts .
What is the Federal Financing Bank ?
The Federal Financing Bank ( FFB ) is a government corporation , created by Congress in 1973 under the general supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury .
The FFB was established to centralize and reduce the cost of federal borrowing as well as federally - assisted borrowing from the public .
Obligations are issued to the public by the Federal Financing Bank ( FFB ) to finance its operations .
Obligations are limited to $ 15 billion unless otherwise authorized by the Appropriations Acts .
Financing the Debt
Why does the debt sometimes decrease ?
The Public Debt Outstanding decreases when there are more redemptions of Treasury securities than there are issues .
How do you make a contribution to reduce the debt ?
There are two ways for you to make a contribution to reduce the debt :
At Pay.gov , you can contribute online by credit card , debit card , PayPal , checking account , or savings account .
You can write a check payable to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service , and , in the memo section , notate that it 's a gift to reduce the debt held by the public .

The Civil Service Retirement And Disability Fund And Government Securities Investment Fund Related To The Debt Limit
The following frequently asked questions provide further information on the actions Treasury is taking to create additional headroom under the debt limit so that the U.S. government can continue funding obligations made by Congresses past and present .
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund ( CSRDF )
What is the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund ?
The CSRDF provides defined benefits to retired and disabled Federal employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System .
How does the debt ceiling affect the CSRDF ?
The CSRDF is invested in special - issue Treasury securities , which count against the debt limit .
In 1986 , Congress provided Treasury statutory authority to take certain actions in the event that the outstanding debt reaches the debt limit .
Specifically , the statute authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to determine that a " debt issuance suspension period " exists and , once he has done so , Treasury can ( 1 ) redeem certain existing investments in the CSRDF , and ( 2 ) suspend new investments by the CSRDF .
What are the investments in the CSRDF that Treasury can redeem ?
The statute governing the CSRDF gives Treasury authority to redeem existing Treasury securities held by the CSRDF in an amount up to the amount of civil service benefit payments authorized to be made from the CSRDF during the debt issuance suspension period .
What is the length of the " debt issuance suspension period " ?
Under the statute that governs the CSRDF , the term " debt issuance suspension period " means the period of time that the Treasury Secretary determines that Treasury securities cannot be issued without exceeding the debt limit .
The determination of the length of the period is based on the facts as they exist at the time .
What are the new investments in the CSRDF that Treasury can suspend ?
The statute authorizes Treasury to suspend the investment of new amounts by the CSRDF during a debt issuance suspension period .
New receipts include contributions from Federal employees and agency employers , as well as the interest payments on securities held by the CSRDF and the proceeds of maturing securities .
What impact will these actions have on Federal employees and their retirement benefits ?
By law , the CSRDF will be made whole once the debt limit is increased .
Benefits for retired and disabled Federal employees will not be affected by this action and will continue to be paid .
Once the United States has exhausted the extraordinary measures it has available to preserve lawful borrowing authority without exceeding the debt limit , however , the U.S. Government will be limited in its ability to make payments across the government .
Has Treasury ever redeemed existing investments and suspended new investments in the CSRDF before ?
Yes , in the past 20 years , Treasury used these extraordinary measures during previous debt limit impasses in 1996 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2006 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 .
Government Securities Investment Fund ( G Fund )
What is the Government Securities Investment Fund ?
The G Fund is a money market defined - contribution retirement fund for Federal employees .
How does the debt ceiling affect the G Fund ?
The G Fund is invested in special - issue Treasury securities , which count against the debt limit .
The entire balance matures daily and is ordinarily reinvested .
In 1987 , Congress granted Treasury the statutory authority to suspend reinvestment of all or part of the balance of the G Fund when the Secretary determines that the Fund cannot be fully invested without exceeding the debt limit .
What impact will this action have on federal employees and their retirement benefits ?
By law , the G Fund will be made whole once the debt limit is increased .
Federal retirees and employees will be unaffected by this action .
Has Treasury ever suspended reinvestment of all or part of the G Fund before ?
Yes , in the past 20 years , Treasury used this extraordinary measure during previous debt limit impasses in 1996 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2006 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , and 2015 .

There are some things in life that just do n’t mix .
Cats and Dogs. Chalk and Cheese .
Stephen Green and the Mental Health Act. Politicians and Photoshop …
In fact , can someone please explain just exactly why it is that its impossible for any politician and / or one of their bag carriers to go anywhere within about six feet of a copy of Photoshop without making a complete and utter fool of themselves .
Credit , where it due , it looks like Iain Dale made the spot , even if he ’s a likely to more than a little off beam with the how …
Take a look at this “ endorsement ” from The One [ Dawn Butler ] on her website , but then think about how she got it .
[ I ’ll show you the image and how it appears to have come about in a moment – U . ]
Assuming the President does n’t have a stash of House of Commons paper secreted in his office , and assuming the signature is genuine ( she did in fact meet him some months ago ) , one has to question whether Dawn Butler had a hand in the drafting of the note , which she then presumably stuck under his nose for him to sign .
Surely Barack Obama would n’t have written such a trite and self serving paragraph himself ?
Would he ?
Now here comes the image , to which I ’ve added two blown - up sections in order to illustrate what appears to have gone on …
Now , I ’ve got to say that , on this occasion , I agree with Iain , here .
The text of the ‘ endorsement ’ just does n’t sound like Obama at all and , in any case , I really ca n’t see Obama doling out personal endorsements of this to any MP and certainly not on the understanding that it could be used in public as what seems , implicitly , to be a ‘ campaigning ’ message .
It looks just that bit too good to be true , and that makes me more than a bit suspicious .
So , if this is a fake , how could it have been done ?
Did Dawn , as Iain suggests , thrust a pre-prepared endorsement under Obama ’s nose and ask him to sign on the dotted line ?
Could she even have got him to plonk his autograph on a blank parliamentary letterhead and then added the effusive missive a little later on ?
No , neither sound plausible , not unless you think that Obama has , almost literally , just got off the last boat .
To understand what ’s gone on here you need to look very carefully and closely and the two blown up portions of the image .
On the left , we have a small section of the letterhead ’s portcullis device , an although there looks to be a slightly paler halo ( anti-aliasing ) effect around the printed portion of the image ( the green bit ) , which you invariably get when you scan a image that was printed onto coloured paper ( in this case , the high quality paper that parliament uses for its letterheads ) the pixels that make up the halo are only slightly paler that the overall image background .
This is precise what you expect to see when you blow up such an image , the text surrounded by a halo which is slightly paler shade of the original background colour .
On the right we have a small portion of Obama ’s signature , and if you looked closely , again , you see the halo effect , only this time , when you look at the colour of palest pixels using Photoshop , what you find is that they are pure white , an effect that you do n’t get if you scan an original signature off coloured paper but which you do get if the signature has been scanned from a white piece of paper or extracted from an image of the signature in which it appeared on white background and pasted onto the original image using Photoshop .
No matter how carefully you extract the signature , you always get a small element of the original background from which it was taken , bleeding through onto the new image when you paste the signature on , and tonal inconsistencies here are what you ’d expect to see from a cut and paste job
Now , although the image appeared on Dawn Butler ’s website until a little earlier today , when it was hastily removed after Iain spotted it and called attention to it , that does n’t mean that she ’s personally responsible for it .
It could just as easily , and maybe even more plausibly , be the handiwork of an over enthusiastic bag carrier , a bag carrier who , if I ’ve called this right , is likely to be looking at the bollocking of a lifetime when the boss gets back into the office .
So we should jump to too many conclusions and should , if we ’re being honest , leave a bit of wiggle room for giving Dawn , personally , the benefit of the doubt .
So , the question here is a somewhat more general one – what it is about politicians and / or their employees that gives them the impression that they can pull off boneheaded stunts using Photoshop without someone spotting what they ’re up to and calling them on it ?
THE PLOT THICKENS
Paul Waugh ’s caught up with Dawn Butler , who ’s giving this version of how she came by the endorsement .
I ’ve just asked Dawn to explain how the letter came about and she says that her Commons team had agreed the wording with the Obama team beforehand .
She then took it into Number 10 and at the end of their meeting she personally handed it for him to sign .
Another letter without the ‘ audacity of hope ’ line was also signed by Mr Obama .
“ Even if it was my office that came up with the words , he knew what he was signing .
My team had asked if it was OK to have this as a quote from him .
I did not arrive with a blank piece of paper and then get him to sign it , ” she says .
“ I only found out at 7 in the morning that I was going to meet him , it was a real surprise .
We probably spoke for about 10 minutes , He was very , very nice to me , asking me how what I did before I became an MP and what drove me .
I was so pleased that he was encouraging me and my position .
Nobody is going to take that moment from me . ”
So , we ’re expected to believe that Obama dished out a personal endorsement to someone he ’d never met before and spent only 10 minutes with on the back of her bag carriers blagging him for comments .
I ’m thinking Healey ’s First Law of Holes here – stop digging !
You see , what Dawn Butler appears to be completely and utterly unaware of is that the publication of any kind of personal endorsement on House of Commons headed stationary amounts to the misuse of the parliamentary device for campaigning purposes .
It ’s one of points on which Nadine Dorries was required to offer an apology to the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards over the design and content of here website
You cannot , as an MP , call on the official imprimatur of Parliament for either campaign purposes or for naked self - promotion .
As I doubt very much whether President Obama will make any kind of comment on this story , at all – in fact I doubt very much that anyone will get anything but a ‘ we do n’t comment on things like this ’ from the White House press operation , we left with her word against the implausibility of the whole scenario .

Mr. McCain promised on election night to “ do all in my power to help ” Mr. Obama .
Some historians say the two men could yet forge the strongest alliance between a president and his election rival since Wendell L. Willkie helped Franklin D. Roosevelt oppose isolationism in the 1940s .
But in his first weeks back in the Senate , Mr. McCain has been quintessentially unpredictable , at times offering quiet counsel to the White House , at others jabbing in all directions .
On some days , he seems bitter , more certain than ever that he could do a better job running the country than Mr. Obama .
“ I have a record of bipartisan work within the Senate ; he does not , ” Mr. McCain said on Feb. 19 in an interview with a newspaper in Kingman , Ariz . , criticizing the president for what he called a lack of bipartisanship on the stimulus plan .
There are also signs that he still harbors grudges from the 2008 presidential campaign .
In the debate over the stimulus bill , he did not mask his fury at the three Republicans who backed the Democrats , particularly Senator Susan Collins , of Maine , once a friend , who won re-election in November in part by distancing herself from Mr. McCain and his campaign tactics .
January 8 , 2009
Todd Chretien reports from the protest in Oakland against the New Year 's Day killing of Oscar Grant III .
" WE WON'T rest until we have honored Oscar Grant by winning justice for his family and ending police brutality in Oakland . "
Those were the words of Dereca Blackmon , one of the principal organizers of a rally and march of nearly 1,000 people on January 7 to protest the murder of 22 - year - old Oscar Grant III early on New Year 's Day by police on an Oakland transit station platform .
Bay Area Rapid Transit ( BART ) officer Johannes Mehserle fired a bullet into Grant 's back as the father of a 4 - year - old girl lay on his stomach , his hands cuffed , according to a lawyer for the Grant family .
The bullet went through Grant 's body , ricocheted off the concrete station platform , and punctured his lungs .
Police tried to confiscate cell phone videos taken by horrified riders who witnessed the shooting , and initially claimed that the station 's security cameras did n't record the incident .
But in the last two days , videos of the murder -- including an especially graphic one taken by a passenger no more than a dozen yards away -- have spread on the Internet , leaving no doubt that Grant was lying motionless when he was shot in the back .
Police , meanwhile , had to admit that security cameras did capture the assault .
Nearly 1,000 people turned out to protest the murder of Oscar Grant by a BART police officer ( Indybay.org )
A few hours before the protest , Mehserle resigned from the force rather than show up to an interview with police internal affairs investigators .
The January 7 rally at the Fruitvale BART station where Grant was killed was organized on little more than a day 's notice , using the social networking Web site Facebook and text messages , with organizers speaking out on the KPFA radio shows of Davey D and Aimee Allison .
The protesters were predominantly African American , but significant numbers of Latinos , Asians , Arabs , Filipinos and whites also participated .
BART police were nowhere to be seen during the demonstration .
BART management closed the Fruitvale station for a while , no doubt frustrating even more people who tried to exit trains to participate in the rally .
Sean Dugar , California NAACP
Youth and College Division president , told the crowd , " It 's not enough that the officer has resigned .
We demand that he be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
Today , the NAACP contacted the attorney general 's office to demand that they take over the investigation . "
What you can do The Coalition Against Police Executions has called for a demonstration on January 14 to demand justice for Oscar Grant .
The protest will start at 4 p.m. at Oakland City Hall , with a planned march to BART headquarters to follow .
For more information about future protests , e-mail [ email protected ] .
On Facebook , go to the Coalition Against Police Execution home page for regular updates on what you can do .
A video of the police shooting of Grant , taken by a BART rider , has been posted online by anti-police brutality activists .
Minister Keith Muhammad of the Nation of Islam asked the crowd to raise their fists in the air and repeat , " I am Oscar Grant ! "
Later , some of the protesters tried to march toward City Hall .
On the way , they were met by a cordon of riot police , who used tear gas and batons to try to disperse them .
A group of the marchers broke away , breaking storefront and car windows and setting fire to at least one vehicle .
Confrontations with police continued for several hours .
THE HORRIFYING videos showing Grant 's murder have transformed the incident from one in a series of police killings in Oakland into a national scandal ; there is even a march on Washington being organized .
At the rally at the Fruitvale station , Malia Lazu , director of The Gathering Project in New York City , said , " I come representing thousands of formerly incarcerated youth who will be doing events in solidarity with you next week across the country , because police brutality must end . "
Earlier in the day , at least 1,000 people attended the funeral for Grant at the Palma Ceia Baptist Church in nearby Hayward .
" They were remembering an extraordinary young man , " said Mer Stevens , a member of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty .
" The sense of anger in the room was thick . "
Signaling a new feeling of defiance , the crowd at the rally was in no mood for promises from politicians .
A representative of Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums announced that the mayor would n't be attending , but that he was concerned about the shooting .
That was met by loud boos from the crowd .
" The officer has resigned , but that is n't enough , " Evan Shamar , who initiated the protest , said in an interview .
" We do n't want him on administrative leave or fired .
We will not rest until this officer is in an American court , on trial for second - degree murder . "
Tony Coleman , a longtime civil rights leader in the Bay Area and friend of the Grant family , spoke for many when he talked about how deeply affected he was by this murder :
Oscar Grant was a teenage friend of my son .
For all the Black fathers who 've been coaching and going to all the practices and sitting in the stands and watching their kids , I want to say that this really hurts , because I watched him grow up .
I watched him in the lay - up line , working on his skills on the court .
To all the Black fathers , you 've got to stay close to your kids when they 're out of high school , because they have a track for them : straight to prison , and if they do n't go there , this is what happens to them .
They kill them , like they do n't mean nothing .
Other speakers at the rally included representatives of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty , ANSWER and the Millions More March , plus youth and community members .
The newly formed Coalition Against Police Execution is planning a major rally for Wednesday , January 14 , at 4 p.m. at Oakland City Hall , with a planned march to BART headquarters to follow .
What a surprise !
No one could have predicted that , in response to Obama reaching out to ( well , bending over for ) Republicans , Republicans would respond by – what ?
– accusing him of being too partisan .
Maybe if Obama makes 99 % of the stimulus package tax cuts for big companies , then the Republicans will like him .
It ’s worth a try , in the spirt of post - partisanship and all .
Republican Sen. John McCain says that Democratic lawmakers putting together an economic stimulus plan are no more open to input from the opposing party than the GOP was during the Bush administration .
The Arizona Republican says that he thought there was going to be a change in the tone of partisanship in Washington when the Obama administration took over , but he adds that he ’s not seeing it .
Yeah , McCain thought there was going to be a change in tone , then McCain and his GOP cronies attacked Obama in a partisan manner , so now there ’s no change in tone and it ’s Obama ’s fault .
Again , Joe and I have written for years about how the Republicans always , always , always accused US of doing what THEY are ACTUALLY doing .
It ’s their oldest trick in the book , and it still works .

I have another paper draft for submission to ICFP 2009 .
This one is called Beautiful differentiation , The paper is a culmination of the several posts I ’ve written on derivatives and automatic differentiation ( AD ) .
I ’m happy with how the derivation keeps getting simpler .
Now I ’ve boiled extremely general higher - order AD down to a Functor and Applicative morphism .
I ’d love to get some readings and feedback .
I ’m a bit over the page the limit , so I ’ll have to do some trimming before submitting .
The abstract :
Automatic differentiation ( AD ) is a precise , efficient , and convenient method for computing derivatives of functions .
Its implementation can be quite simple even when extended to compute all of the higher - order derivatives as well .
The higher - dimensional case has also been tackled , though with extra complexity .
This paper develops an implementation of higher - dimensional , higher - order differentiation in the extremely general and elegant setting of calculus on manifolds and derives that implementation from a simple and precise specification .
In order to motivate and discover the implementation , the paper poses the question “ What does AD mean , independently of implementation ? ”
An answer arises in the form of naturality of sampling a function and its derivative .

The private sector will be asked to manage and run a communications database that will keep track of everyone 's calls , emails , texts and internet use under a key option contained in a consultation paper to be published next month by Jacqui Smith , the home secretary .
A cabinet decision to put the management of the multibillion pound database of all UK communications traffic into private hands would be accompanied by tougher legal safeguards to guarantee against leaks and accidental data losses .
But in his strongest criticism yet of the superdatabase , Sir Ken Macdonald , the former director of public prosecutions , who has firsthand experience of working with intelligence and law enforcement agencies , told the Guardian such assurances would prove worthless in the long run and warned it would prove a " hellhouse " of personal private information .
" Authorisations for access might be written into statute .
The most senior ministers and officials might be designated as scrutineers .
But none of this means anything , " said Macdonald .
" All history tells us that reassurances like these are worthless in the long run .
In the first security crisis the locks would loosen . "
The home secretary postponed the introduction of legislation to set up the superdatabase in October and instead said she would publish a consultation paper in the new year setting out the proposal and the safeguards needed to protect civil liberties .
She has emphasised that communications data , which gives the police the identity and location of the caller , texter or web surfer but not the content , has been used as important evidence in 95 % of serious crime cases and almost all security service operations since 2004 including the Soham and 21/7 bombing cases .
Until now most communications traffic data has been held by phone companies and internet service providers for billing purposes but the growth of broadband phone services , chatrooms and anonymous online identities mean that is no longer the case .
The Home Office 's interception modernisation programme , which is working on the superdatabase proposal , argues that it is no longer good enough for communications companies to be left to retrieve such data when requested by the police and intelligence services .
A Home Office spokeswoman said last night the changes were needed so law enforcement agencies could maintain their ability to tackle serious crime and terrorism .
Senior Whitehall officials responsible for planning for a new database say there is a significant difference between having access to " communications data " - names and addresses of emails or telephone numbers , for example - and the actual contents of the communications .
" We have been very clear that there are no plans for a database containing any content of emails , texts or conversations , " the spokeswoman said .
External estimates of the cost of the superdatabase have been put as high as £ 12bn , twice the cost of the ID cards scheme , and the consultation paper , to be published towards the end of next month , will include an option of putting it into the hands of the private sector in an effort to cut costs .
But such a decision is likely to fuel civil liberties concerns over data losses and leaks .
Macdonald , who left his post as DPP in October , told the Guardian : " The tendency of the state to seek ever more powers of surveillance over its citizens may be driven by protective zeal .
But the notion of total security is a paranoid fantasy which would destroy everything that makes living worthwhile .
We must avoid surrendering our freedom as autonomous human beings to such an ugly future .
We should make judgments that are compatible with our status as free people . "
Maintaining the capacity to intercept suspicious communications was critical in an increasingly complex world , he said .
" It is a process which can save lives and bring criminals to justice .
But no other country is considering such a drastic step .
This database would be an unimaginable hell - house of personal private information , " he said .
" It would be a complete readout of every citizen 's life in the most intimate and demeaning detail .
No government of any colour is to be trusted with such a roadmap to our souls . "
The moment there was a security crisis the temptation for more commonplace access would be irresistible , he said .
Other critics of the plan point to the problems of keeping the database secure , both from the point of view of the technology and of deliberate leaks .
The problem would be compounded if private companies manage the system .
" If there is a breach of security in that database it would be utterly devastating , " one said .

From the beginning we were prepared , we knew just what to do , for had n’t we seen it all a hundred times ? — the good people of the town going about their business , the suddenly interrupted TV programs , the faces in the crowd looking up , the little girl pointing in the air , the mouths opening , the dog yapping , the traffic stopped , the shopping bag falling to the sidewalk , and there , in the sky , coming closer . . .
And so , when it finally happened , because it was bound to happen , we all knew it was only a matter of time , we felt , in the midst of our curiosity and terror , a certain calm , the calm of familiarity , we knew what was expected of us , at such a moment .
The story broke a little after ten in the morning .
The TV anchors looked exactly the way we knew they ’d look , their faces urgent , their hair neat , their shoulders tense , they were filling us with alarm but also assuring us that everything was under control , for they , too , had been prepared for this , in a sense had been waiting for it , already they were looking back at themselves during their great moment .
The sighting was indisputable but , at the same time , inconclusive : something from out there had been detected , it appeared to be approaching our atmosphere at great speed , the Pentagon was monitoring the situation closely .
We were urged to remain calm , to stay inside , to await further instructions .
Some of us left work immediately and hurried home to our families , others stayed close to the TV , the radio , the computer , we were all talking into our cells .
Through our windows we could see people at their windows , looking up at the sky .
All that morning we followed the news fiercely , like children listening to a thunderstorm in the dark .
Whatever was out there was still unknown , scientists had not yet been able to determine its nature , caution was advised but there was no reason for panic , our job was to stay tuned and sit tight and await further developments .
And though we were anxious , though quivers of nervousness ran along our bodies like mice , we wanted to see whatever it was , we wanted to be there , since after all it was coming toward us , it was ours to witness , as if we were the ones they ’d chosen , out there on the other side of the sky .
For already it was being said that our town was the likely landing place , already the TV crews were rolling in .
We wondered where it would land : between the duck pond and the seesaws in the public park , or deep in the woods at the north end of town , or maybe in the field out by the mall , where a new excavation was already under way , or maybe it would glide over the old department store on Main Street and crash through the second - floor apartments above Mangione ’s Pizza and Café , with a great shattering of brick and glass , maybe it would land on the throughway and we ’d see eighteen - wheelers turn over , great chunks of pavement rise up at sharp angles , and car after car swerve into the guardrail and roll down the embankment .
Something appeared in the sky shortly before one o’clock .
Many of us were still at lunch , others were already outside , standing motionless on the streets and sidewalks , gazing up .
There were shouts and cries , arms in the air , a wildness of gesturing , pointing .
And , sure enough , something was glittering , up there in the sky , something was shimmering , in the blue air of summer — we saw it clearly , whatever it was .
Secretaries in offices rushed to windows , storekeepers abandoned their cash registers and hurried outdoors , road workers in orange hard hats looked up from the asphalt , shaded their eyes .
It must have lasted — that faraway glow , that spot of shimmer — some three or four minutes .
Then it began to grow larger , until it was the size of a dime , a quarter .
Suddenly the entire sky seemed to be filled with points of gold .
Then it was coming down on us , like fine pollen , like yellow dust .
It lay on our roof slopes , it sifted down onto our sidewalks , covered our shirtsleeves and the tops of our cars .
We did not know what to make of it .
“ What is it , Lassie — is Timmy in trouble ? ” Facebook
Twitter
Email
Shopping
It continued to come down , that yellow dust , for nearly thirteen minutes .
During that time we could not see the sky .
Then it was over .
The sun shone , the sky was blue .
Throughout the downpour , we ’d been warned to stay inside , to be careful , to avoid touching the substance from outer space , but it had happened so quickly that most of us had streaks of yellow on our clothes and in our hair .
Soon after the warnings , we heard cautious reassurances : preliminary tests revealed nothing toxic , though the nature of the yellow dust remained unknown .
Animals that had eaten it revealed no symptoms .
We were urged to keep out of its way and await further test results .
Meanwhile it lay over our lawns and sidewalks and front steps , it coated our maple trees and telephone poles .
We were reminded of waking in the morning after the first snow .
From our porches we watched the three - wheeled sweepers move slowly along our streets , carrying it off in big hoppers .
We hosed down our grass , our front walks , our porch furniture .
We looked up at the sky , we waited for more news — already we were hearing reports that the substance was composed of one - celled organisms — and through it all we could sense the swell of our disappointment .
We had wanted , we had wanted — oh , who knew what we ’d been looking for ?
We had wanted blood , crushed bones , howls of agony .
We had wanted buildings crumbling onto streets , cars bursting into flame .
We had wanted monstrous versions of ourselves with enlarged heads on stalklike necks , merciless polished robots armed with death rays .
We had wanted noble lords of the universe with kind , soft eyes , who would usher in a glorious new era .
We had wanted terror and ecstasy — anything but this yellow dust .
Had it even been an invasion ?
Later that afternoon , we learned that scientists all agreed : the dust was a living thing .
Samples had been flown to Boston , Chicago , Washington , D.C.
The single - celled organisms appeared to be harmless , though we were cautioned not to touch anything , to keep the windows shut , to wash our hands .
The cells reproduced by binary fission .
They appeared to do nothing but multiply .
In the morning , we woke to a world covered in yellow dust .
It lay on the tops of our fences , on the crossbars of telephone poles .
Black tire tracks showed in the yellow streets .
Birds , shaking their wings , threw up sprays of yellow powder .
Again the street - sweepers came , the hoses splashed on driveways and lawns , making a yellow mist and revealing the black and the green underneath .
Within an hour the driveways and lawns resembled yellow fields .
Lines of yellow ran along cables and telephone wires .
According to the news , the unicellular microorganisms are rod-shaped and nourish themselves by photosynthesis .
A single cell , placed in a brightly illuminated test tube , divides at such a rate that the tube will fill in about forty minutes .
An entire room , in strong light , will fill in six hours .
The organisms do not fit easily into our classification schemes , though in some respects they resemble blue - green algae .
There is no evidence that they are harmful to human or animal life .
We have been invaded by nothing , by emptiness , by animate dust .
The invader appears to have no characteristic other than the ability to reproduce rapidly .
It does n’t hate us .
It does n’t seek our annihilation , our subjection and humiliation .
Nor does it desire to protect us from danger , to save us , to teach us the secret of immortal life .
What it wishes to do is replicate .
It is possible that we will find a way of limiting the spread of this primitive intruder , or of eliminating it altogether ; it ’s also possible that we will fail and that our town will gradually disappear under a fatal accumulation .
As we follow the reports from day to day , the feeling grows in us that we deserved something else , something bolder , something grander , something more thrilling , something bristling or fiery or fierce , something that might have represented a revelation or a destiny .
We imagine ourselves surrounding the tilted spaceship , waiting for the door to open .
We imagine ourselves protecting our children , slashing the tentacles that thrust in through the smashed cellar windows .
Instead , we sweep our front walks , hose off our porches , shake out our shoes and sneakers .
The invader has entered our homes .
Despite our drawn shades and closed curtains , it lies in thick layers on our end tables and windowsills .
It lies along the tops of our flat - screen televisions and the narrow edges of our shelved DVDs .
Through our windows we can see the yellow dust covering everything , forming gentle undulations .
We can almost see it rising slowly , like bread .
Here and there it catches the sunlight and reminds us , for a moment , of fields of wheat .
It is really quite peaceful , in its way . ♦

CLEVELAND — Amber
Hill suffered with bouts of depression , hallucinations and suicidal thoughts for four years before she drowned her two daughters in a bathtub in her Cleveland apartment .
A psychologist hired by the defense and a court psychiatrist testified Thursday before a three - judge panel in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court that Hill was so deeply depressed the day she killed Janelle Cintron , 4 , and Cecess Hill , 2 , that she did not understand that what she was doing was wrong .
Hill , 23 , is charged with aggravated murder for the girls ' deaths and could face the death penalty if convicted .
She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity .
Prosecutors rested their case against Hill Thursday morning -- the third day of the trial which is being decided by the judges , not a jury .
The prosecution did not call any witnesses to testify to Hill 's sanity .
But they have indicated they plan to call two rebuttal witnesses this morning .
Reading from a transcript of his interview with Hill , psychologist John Fabian said Hill saw the children as an extension of herself and wanted to put them all out of their misery .
Hill described to the psychologist her version of what happened Oct. 1 , 2007 , the day she killed her daughters .
She spent most of that morning crying in her bedroom before she drew a bath for the girls and helped them into the tub .
As she stood watching them with her arms crossed , Hill told the doctor , she momentarily considered getting them dressed and ready for the day .
But then she heard the voices in her head .
She had been hearing them for months -- her mother asking her what she was going to do with her life ; her boyfriend , Jaime Cintron , calling her name ; and another voice that she described as demonic encouraging her to kill herself .
On that day , however , the voices told her to " do it ! " -- to drown her children .
And she complied .
First she held Janelle 's head underwater .
The girl kicked and thrashed , Hill said , until her little body went limp .
As she held Cecess down in the tub , the toddler looked up through the water at her mom , Hill told the psychologist .
But she was smaller than her sister and struggled less .
Hill said she killed her two girls as a way to get help for her deepening depression without killing herself .
" I thought this was how I could get help , " Hill said during the psychological analysis .
" And I needed to know that people loved me .
I felt like part of my brain was gone . "
Dr. Sherif Soliman , a court psychiatrist who evaluated Hill , told the judges that Hill 's severe depression spurred psychotic symptoms , such as auditory hallucinations .
Hill struggled with the delusions and believed that because she was suffering , her daughters were suffering too , Soliman said .
She wanted her children to feel the peace she could not .
She did not expect to be punished for her actions and was surprised to learn that the police detective who interrogated her was not there to help her , Soliman said .
Hill told Soliman during her psychiatric evaluation that as she returned to her apartment after calling Cintron from a pay phone to tell him what she had done , she stopped at the mailbox to pick up her mail .
" She saw a check in there and thought about cashing it later that day , " Soliman said .
" She did n't know that what she was doing was wrong . "
Prosecutors pointed out during their cross-examination of the doctors that Hill shut the shower curtain after drowning her children , indicating that she did n't want to see them and was disgusted by her actions .
Fabian said Hill explained to him that she did n't want to see her girls exposed and closed the curtain to keep them safe .
" There is a theme of misery and of benevolence -- of saving them from her own psychotic and depressed demons that she was struggling with , " Fabian said .
" She thought she had to save her children from her own death or suicide . "
Nortel Networks Corp. sought protection from creditors in the U.S. and Canada , falling victim to the economic downturn and years of struggle to turn around what was once Canada 's largest company .
The Chapter 11 filing further weakened the ranks of major telecom - equipment makers and sent chills through suppliers already coping with declining sales of network gear and handsets .
Phone carriers more than ever are seeking suppliers with good products and better balance sheets .
" The strong are going to get stronger , " said telecom analyst Ping Zhao of CreditSights , a stock and bond research firm .
Ms. Zhao gave Nortel little hope of emerging from bankruptcy .
" They were already out of favor due to their weak finances , but for any of the new projects , they are definitely out of the picture " due to the filing .
A $ 107 million interest payment due Thursday may have hastened Nortel 's decision to seek protection from creditors , analysts said .
The Toronto - based company is entering bankruptcy court with $ 2.4 billion in cash to fund day - to - day operations , at a time when financing is drying up for companies reorganizing under bankruptcy protection .
Corporate bankruptcies and defaults , which experts predict will double in 2009 , are striking industries ranging from retail , chemicals and autos .
Falling consumer and business demand for their products are hitting at the same time payments are due on debt accumulated in recent years of easy credit .
Lenders also are tightening restrictions on borrowers , making it harder for struggling companies to avoid bankruptcy .
Pictured :
The cow that was zapped by lightning - and survived
It has certainly been flame grilled but this extraordinary cow is still standing .
The poor creature was struck by lightning and left with blistering burns .
You would expect it to have been cooked alive .
But the cow miraculously survived , apparently unperturbed by the ordeal , and is already back roaming the meadows .
Flame grilled :
This poor cow was struck by lightning but , in a rare freak of nature , lives to the tell the tale
Professor of Physical Geography , Jon Nott of James Cook University , said the event was rare but entirely feasible .
He said : ' Cows are susceptible to lightning strikes because both sets of legs are on the ground .
' But , more often than not , they die from it . '
He added : ' The electricity from a lightning strike would enter the front set of legs and exit out the back legs so , based on the picture , it is possible it happened .
' While I can't explain the knee wounds , the ankle wounds would be consistent with those of lightning . '
The cow is believed to have been struck by the bolt in Gladstone , Queensland , Australia , last month .
But if it was n't for its horrific wounds , you could hardly tell the animal had suffered .
Perhaps it has drawn comfort from the old wive 's tale .
After all , we are all told that lightning never strikes in the same place twice .
DAMASCUS -
This morning , while I made my coffee and eggs , I tuned in to the best show on television .
When I went next door to buy my milk , the owner of the Rawda Grocery Store was already watching it , and down in the Sha'alan neighborhood , at the restaurant where I ate breakfast yesterday , customers are sitting over their bowls of fava bean soup , eyes glued to the screen .
Millions across the region are following it along with us .
The show is the conflict in Gaza .
On Al - Jazeera .
Israel has restricted international reporters and camera crews from Gaza , so the Qatari network is one of the few international media outlets to have a full , working bureau inside Gaza City .
Even if CNN could sneak a camera crew through the checkpoints , it 's hard to imagine they would produce anything like what 's on Al - Jazeera - an all - day , ever - shifting drama that throws war in your face with all its gruesome cruelty .
It is openly partisan , almost never showing Israeli deaths or injuries .
It is also provocative and upsetting in a way that looks nothing like news in the West .
Their broadcasts routinely feature mutilated corpses being pulled from the scene of an explosion , or hospital interviews with maimed children , who bemoan the loss of their siblings or their parents - often killed in front of their eyes .
Al - Jazeera splices archival footage into the live shots , weaving interviews and expertly produced montages into a devastating narrative you can follow from the comfort of your own home .
This is news without even the pretense of impartiality .
After several days of following the Al - Jazeera coverage of Gaza , I 've never seen a live interview with an Israeli , neither a politician nor a civilian .
In the Al - Jazeera version , the Gaza conflict has only two participants : the Israeli army - an impersonal force represented as tanks and planes on the map - and the Palestinian civilians , often shown entering the hospital on makeshift stretchers .
There are few Hamas rockets and no Israeli families .
It 's not hard to see why Al - Jazeera is accused of deliberately inflaming regional enmity and instability .
But in a larger sense , Al - Jazeera 's graphic response to CNN - style " bloodless war journalism " is a stinging rebuke to the way we now see and talk about war in the United States .
It suggests that bloodless coverage of war is the privilege of a country far from conflict .
Al - Jazeera 's brand of news - you could call it " blood journalism " - takes war for what it is : a brutal loss of human life .
The images they show put you in visceral contact with the violence of war in a way statistics never could .
For an American , to watch Al - Jazeera 's coverage of Gaza is to realize that you 've become alienated not just from war , but even from the representation of war as a real thing .
As Americans , we 're used to hearing the sound of heavy artillery , machine guns , and bombs in action films and video games .
Yet here on the news , they seem strangely out of place .
You could argue that Al - Jazeera uses images of civilian violence to foment public outrage against Israel .
This might well be true .
At the same time , these images acknowledge human suffering and civilian death and stand strongly against them - and in doing so , foment outrage against war itself .
Whether you are a fan or a critic of the network 's presentation of the news , it 's hard to deny that Al - Jazeera is , first and foremost , excellent television .
The network 's command of the form is one reason why it has resisted being marginalized , and even gained in prestige , despite acrimonious criticism from the American government and from many Western media sources .
Watching its sounds and images , day after day , has a powerful effect totally outside the framework of the conflict it 's covering .
Al - Jazeera choreographs its Gaza coverage with a sophistication that goes well beyond the dramatic representation of violence .
To watch the war on Al - Jazeera is to be captured in a new rendering of time , and to become part of an " imagined community " defined by it .
The network uses a ticker - tape format , with a constant flow of text underneath the main image .
To the left is a small box that counts the days of the war in red and white fonts .
Thus , while watching the news , you 're introduced to a new calendar , in which the beginning of the war is the beginning of time .
The ticker tape at the bottom of the screen includes a running count of the human cost of the war , steadily tolling the number of wounded and dead .
The network 's producers seem to have learned a lot from American reality television , where real footage is crafted and spliced into a compelling narrative with characters , personal conflict , and a dramatic arc .
Each day , viewers here in Syria and across the Arab world tune into a new " episode . "
Each day , the war 's narrative builds and folds back on itself , reinforcing the audience 's familiarity with the cast of characters : Hamas , the scrappy rebel ; Israel , the regional bully ; the civilians of Gaza - and , in particular , the wounded children - caught in the middle of the conflict .
The " international community " is a bloviating model of inefficacy , tied up in innumerable committees and summits .
Through it all stride the Al - Jazeera correspondents , decked out in blue bulletproof vests .
Al - Jazeera often goes live to the correspondent in Gaza City right at the beginning of the daily three - hour cease - fire , when the Israeli army is supposed to put down its arms to allow the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza .
During this shot , the correspondent inevitably " catches " live footage of the Israelis continuing to bomb well into the cease - fire period , and inevitably expresses surprise and dismay at what he is seeing , even though he is essentially replaying a scene he framed the same way the day before , and the day before that .
The staged suspense , the protestations of surprise - they smack of cynical theater .
But it 's hard to argue with the footage itself :
There have been several independent reports of Israeli attacks and raids during the daily cease - fire .
However they choose to frame it , Al - Jazeera correspondents are capturing events that other networks cannot .
At that basic level , what they 're doing is irreplaceable as journalism .
As perverse as it may sound , Al - Jazeera 's coverage of the war satisfies , in the same way that a sitcom or serialized drama satisfies .
It 's not so much surprise that keeps bringing you back , but rather your familiarity with the characters ' flaws and faults .
And you know that your experience of the drama is not individual but rather collective .
Walk into any cafe , grocery store , or dry cleaner in Damascus , and you are almost certain to find a TV tuned to Al - Jazeera 's around - the - clock coverage of the war in Gaza .
There is solidarity and also a certain comfort in watching the grim reality of war en masse .
It is impossible for me to imagine American viewers caring this much about a war they were not fighting themselves , especially one presented CNN - style , as an intermittent report of statistics , diplomacy , and military briefings .
Al - Jazeera 's critics would argue that the network has a lot to learn from the objectivity prized and upheld by well - regarded Western media outlets .
But the American media has something to learn , too : Showing the actual violence of war is how you get the public to grasp the nature of war .
Our networks ' squeamishness about violence lets us keep human death and suffering at a distance , an abstract consequence of policy .
If what you are worried about is individuals , then to look away from violence is not a neutral position .
The most compelling refrain of Al - Jazeera 's Gaza coverage is not , however , its news reports , but rather a short montage titled " The War on Gaza , " which the channel intersperses between news segments .
The montage reassembles itself each day , incorporating new images and reorganizing old ones , oscillating between images of the war and images of international protests against the war .
The images change each day , but two appear every time .
First , there is a young girl , face covered in blood , crying amid the smoke of a recent explosion .
A phantom adult arm is carrying the girl from the scene .
The adult body is cropped off , and all you see is the girl 's face frozen in anguish and pain .
The second recurring image is the one that closes each edition of the montage : Scenes of pro-Palestine street protests from around the world , ending in a close - up of a tall , defiant poster with the words , in English , " Stop the Holocaust in Gaza . "
The montage then fades to a red background , in which you can discern the image of a wounded child whose moribund eyes are turned skyward .
The montage creates an impression , renewed every day , of mass outrage against the war , not only in the Arab world , but also in Europe .
Yet here in Damascus , even the street demonstrations I 've seen do n't seem to carry the heat of people 's mass absorption with the TV coverage of the war .
Former Gitmo guard ' ashamed ' he once participated in detainee abuse David Edwards and Muriel Kane

As the debate over closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay heats up , the treatment of the prisoners there has become a matter for close scrutiny .
Over the last seven years , Pentagon officials have repeatedly insisted that the treatment of the prisoners is , in former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 's words , " humane and ... fully consistent with international conventions . "
However , Breandon Neely , who was a guard at Guantanamo when it first opened in 2002 , has recently come forward to dispute those claims .
Neely was honorably discharged from the military last year and now leads the Houston chapter of Iraq Veterans Against the War .
He told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Tuesday , " We were just told from the git - go that these were the guys who planned 9/11 .
That these were the worst people in the world . "
Neely went on to recount an incident which he has previously described in his testimony for the Guantánamo Testimonials Project of the University of California at Davis as " something that I am very ashamed of . "
On the the day that the first prisoners arrived , Neely and another guard were put in charge of an older man who was nervous and shaking .
When they placed him in a cage and went to take his handcuffs off , the man -- fearing , as Neely later learned , that he was about to be executed -- jerked sharply away .
" Just out of reaction , I slammed him to the ground and got on top of him , " Neely recalled .
" I was just holding him down by the head and a couple of seconds later I was pulled out of the cage by other soldiers that had came to help .
They went ahead and hog - tied him .
...
The next day , we arrived to the camp .
I was walking by and I could see on the side of his face , he was all scraped up and bruised . "
" I was young and did n't question anything back then , " Neely told the Testimonials Project .
" But even then , when I was as pissed off as anyone there , I felt ashamed of what I did .
As the years have went on and the more I learn the more guilt I feel .
This is one of the incidents from my time at Guantanamo that haunts me . "
Neely also told Maddow of an occasion when he was present as a medic struck a prisoner who was refusing medicine and how he realized later that the medic had deliberately directed him to stand where he would block the view of the guards in the tower .
" It 's just something you relive every day of your life , " Neely said of his experiences .
" Over time , it 's just really built up , and every day I think about it and I relive those situations .
And it gets the best of me , and the best way for me to deal with it is to speak out .
... Around December , everything just really hit me and I just knew I had to talk . "
" I think the public has a right to know what really went on , " Neely concluded .

Fox just put in an order for two more seasons of The Simpsons , ensuring that it will exceed Gunsmoke 's 20 - year run to become the longest - running primetime series ever .
Here 's why it may never end .
The Simpsons still has a ways to go before it can surpass the amount of episodes Gunsmoke produced ; due to then - longer seasons , the western banked 635 episodes ( whereas the current Simpsons renewal would bring it to 493 ) .
However , we have full faith that Fox will continue to keep The Simpsons on the air long enough to outlast even that record .
How can we be so sure ?
· The show still does all right in the ratings .
Do n't mistake us — The Simpsons is hitting all - time lows this season .
Then again , so are many network shows this year .
The difference is that The Simpsons is the 8 p.m. linchpin for a night of animation that helps anchor the higher - rated Family Guy , and Fox would never sacrifice such an ideal lead - in .
Hell , even King of the Hill managed to stick around for thirteen seasons based on Fox 's Sunday night strategy .
· The voice actors may eventually become expendable .
In 1998 , the show 's six main voice actors threatened to quit if their pay was n't upped from $ 30,000 per episode .
In response , Fox immediately scheduled auditions to replace them , and a deal was reached ( subsequent negotiations over the years raised their pay rate to the current $ 400,000 per episode ) .
In this case , The Simpsons ' decades - long ubiquity may work against it — if
Fox wants to cut costs and fire the original cast , they 'd surely be able to find new actors raised on the show who could closely replicate the voices ( the genius comic timing would certainly suffer , but are fans still ardent enough to make a fuss ? ) .
The network already enacted such a move in 1999 , when minor voice actor Maggie Roswell ( who performed characters like Maude Flanders and Helen Lovejoy ) was fired after asking for a pay raise , and only hired back after several years ' absence .
Did anyone notice ?
· The Simpsons is a billion - dollar global franchise .
Fox has become even more of a corporate behemoth since The Simpsons first premiered in 1989 , and it's hard to imagine they 'd ever devalue one of their few properties that can keep a comparatively enormous pace .
At this point , it almost does n't matter what ratings the flagship series gets — not when its merchandise continues to sell all over the world , or when a feature - length movie version produced well past the show 's peak makes well over $ 500 million .
Someday , then , when NBC is running ten hours of Today ( leading straight into a four - hour block of Jay Leno , Conan O'Brien , Jimmy Fallon , and Howie Mandel ) , you can be certain that The Simpsons will keep on keepin ' on .
And this is where we would post our favorite Simpsons episode ( the Gamblor one , natch ) , but Hulu has cruelly yanked every old episode off their service , keeping only the latest five instead .
If only it aired constantly in syndication or something !
If there is one thing that annoys me when seeing arguments against Communism is persistent ignorance .
We ’re not talking about simple ignorance where someone is not aware of a fact , but the kind of stubborn insintense on false ideas even when one has explicitly been told that they have it wrong .
At this point we ’re not simply talking about someone who has it wrong but about someone who is unwilling to learn .
Witness now this obtuse argument from BadTux who tries to explain why Communism is doomed to failure with arguments even a cursory look at an introductory text to Marxism should have put to rest .
He flies right off the bat by separating the political aspect of Communism from the economic , not obviously undertanding that this is impossible .
Communism is not simply an economic system but a complete one , ecompassing social , political and economic aspects .
You cannot disconnect the economic aspect of Communism from the social simply because it requires a specific type of society to work .
Communism is about having a classless , stateless society .
It ’s that simple .
If you have a state or separation of classes , whether in the form of government bureaucrats or simple capitalists , you cannot claim to be in Communism .
In any sense .
It ’s that simple .
So by taking the economic aspect of the Soviet Union and calling it “ Economic Communism ” , you are using a flawed system as an example .
Next , we have the argument of how people would not join communes by themselves and they would have to be forced .
Something which is of course totally away from any historical reality .
If BadTux had bothered to actually read the History of the Russian Revolution he would have seen how “ few ” people were willing to to form soviets .
The reality was that people were joining Soviets by the thousands , both the proletariat in the cities and the peasants in the armies .
They were very much the majority and did not have to use any force .
He at least tries later to improve the validity of his article by talking about “ modern communism ” not realizing that there is nothing “ modern ” about it but rather that the original idea was about industrial societies .
The idea for Communism was that it always required an industrialized society before it could take hold .
This was the original idea from the time of Marx .
The lack of a big proletariat in Russia and China was a large , if not the largest reason why the revolutions failed .
A feudal peasant population is incompatible with Communism .
Then we ’re treated to the impossibility of handling the modern production under communism simply by bringing up all the elements required for a product .
But that ’s just it .
There ’s no explanation of why this makes it impossible other than the inability of the author to think about it .
And with these arguments we are then told “ So this , then , explains why communism as an economic system has failed every time it has been tried ” and then goes on to bring the Soviet Union as an example .
So he has failed to grasp what Communism even is , and then brought up State Capitalist society as proof .
Incredible !
We then continue with the “ other aspect ” of Communism which is the political which apparently has been shown to fail …in a capitalistic society .
What BadTux does not realize is that Communism does not work on an per-nation basis .
Communism has to be achieved internationally so as to not have the need for standing armies or a state apparatus .
Even Lenin recognised the need for International movements for Communism and this is what he was counting on .
He knew that if that did not happen , the Russian Revolution was in a really tight spot .
It is no worth looking at individual communes in a Capitalist society as they are not the point or an example of socialism .
Their struggle to survive in a Capitalist society is what creates contradictions among the people within .
This “ problem of power ” that BadTux keeps referring to does not exist in a society where people can easily leave a syndic they do not like and immediately join another or form their own .
And indeed .
there is no better example for this than the Free Software movement .
Therein you have groups of people clustered around any specific application and you have a benevolent dictator at the top .
This “ leader ” or group of leaders that BadTux claims would always cause problems and dissolving the group .
However not only does this work our , but it works admirably .
When the leaders are indeed benevolent , the group prospers and keeps them in their place due to their abilities .
If the leaders misbehave enough however , the dissatisfied people simply fork the project and start a new group .
What “ problem of power ” ?
This is why such arguments from ignorants are so annoying .
You end up having to refute arguments which have nothing to do with Communism at all .
This is not productive at all to the Communist who does not learn anything new but rather has to waste time pointing out strawmen left and right .
Argue why the Labour Theory of Value is wrong .
Argue how exploitation of the worker does not exist .
Argue , in short , for things that Marxism actually explains and proposes , not whatever half - truths you gathered from school and popular news sources .

Rob Knox ( right ) was protective of his younger brother A teenage actor who had a part in the forthcoming Harry Potter film was stabbed to death as he tried to protect his brother , a court has heard .
Rob Knox , 18 , was stabbed five times outside the Metro Bar , in Sidcup , south - east London , in May last year .
He was protecting his 17 - year - old brother Jamie from Karl Bishop who was " running amok " , the jury was told .
Mr Bishop , 21 , of Sidcup , denies murder and five charges of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm .
' Chilling prediction ' Brian Altman QC , prosecuting , said of the young actor : " Unfortunately , his courage and his sense of duty were to cost him his life . "
The stabbing followed a row at the same venue the previous week after which Mr Bishop allegedly made a " chilling " prediction , the Old Bailey jury heard .
Mr Altman said : " He was heard to say , ' I 'm going to come back next week and someone 's going to die ' . "
The defence claims that Mr Bishop , of Carlton Road , Sidcup , was acting in self - defence .
Mr Knox , of Swanley , Kent , had just finished filming the role of Marcus Belby in the forthcoming film Harry Potter and The Half - Blood Prince .
Mr Altman said : " A few minutes after midnight on May 24 last year , Rob Knox was stabbed to death by this defendant , who was running amok outside the Metro Bar .
' Particularly unfortunate '
" At the time , Bishop was armed with two quite ordinary but two quite lethal knives which had come from his kitchen and with which he had quite deliberately armed himself . "
He added : " Tragically , in the melee , Rob Knox lost his life .
" Rob was just one of a number of young people who , over the past year or so , have fallen victim to knife crime in London .
" He was particularly unfortunate because he fell victim to a young man who was not only an habitual knife carrier but also someone who would quite happily deploy and use knives as weapons , two in this case , to settle scores .
" That is precisely what happened here . "
Mr Altman said both Rob and his brother were interested in drama and had parts in a film about King Arthur .
He said that Mr Knox was a " popular young man " and was " especially protective " of his younger brother .

A few weeks ago I made a video outlining why I think science is important .
This was part of a much larger project started by Alom Shaha in London , to show people , well , why science is important .
He got lots of scientists and educators to make videos or write comments on the topic , and they 're fascinating to read .
And now Alom has created a video wrapping all this together .
It 's very well done , and well worth your time to watch .
There were any number of times I found myself smiling goofily at how wonderful this is .

A nutritionist from the Universite de Montreal warns about the negative impact of energy drinks on health .
It is worth mentioning that nowadays it 's quite common for students to consume energy drinks so they could study at night .
According to Stephanie Cote , nutritionist with Extenso , a Universite de Montreal health and nutrition think - tank , energy drinks represent the " coffee of a new generation " .
They have a negative impact on health due to the fact that they are composed of sugar and caffeine .
In 2008 the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada , which offers information , research and technology , as well as policies and programs to reach security of the food system and health of the environment , presented a report which states that 1.5 billion cans of Red Bull were acquired by American students in 2004 .
In Canada energy drinks represent a growing trend for people aged between 18 and 24 .
In addition , more children start consuming these drinks before they do any physical activity .
However , researchers warn that energy drinks should no be used by athletes and children under the age of 12 .
Cote mentioned that such drinks as Red Bull do not hydrate human body efficiently due to the fact that they include a large amount of sugar .
Besides , caffeine does not automatically improve physical performance since if consumed in large quantities it can lead to fatigue and dehydration , informs the official website of Universite de Montreal .
A number of studies proved that high level of caffeine increases hypertension , causes heart palpitations , leads to irritability and anxiety .
In addition , a strong dose of caffeine causes insomnia and headaches .
Researchers do not advise consuming more than 2 cans of energy drinks per day .
Nevertheless , the warning is often not taken into consideration and about 50 percent of young people , aged between 18 and 24 , consume energy drinks mixed with alcohol .
Despite the warnings , many students still enjoy consuming the so - called Vodka Red Bull .
" Usually when someone consumes too much alcohol , their head spins and they feel tired .
Energy drinks cancel out these warning signs " , said Cote .
Thus the person continues consuming alcohol without realizing that he or she is already drunk .

HONG KONG 
The number of executions worldwide nearly doubled last year compared with 2007 , according to Amnesty International , and China put to death far more people than the rest of the world put together .
In its annual report on the death penalty , Amnesty International on Tuesday chronicled beheadings in Saudi Arabia ; hangings in Japan , Iraq , Singapore and Sudan ; lethal injections in China ; an electrocution in the United States ; firing squads in Afghanistan , Belarus and Vietnam ; and stonings in Iran .
In all , 59 countries still have the death penalty on their books , but only 25 carried out executions last year .
Two nations , Uzbekistan and Argentina , banned the death penalty last year .
Amnesty International said at least 2,390 people were executed worldwide in 2008 , compared with its 2007 figure of at least 1,252 .

In Memoriam ( Again ) : Pat Tillman , 1976 - 2004 ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/1/2009 , 2:51 pm PT
Pat Tillman 's mother Mary said in 2005 , about the Bush Administration 's unforgivable cover - up , exploitation of her son's death by " friendly - fire " in Afghanistan before the 2004 Presidential Election ...
" Pat had high ideals about the country ; that 's why he did what he did , " Mary Tillman said in her first lengthy interview since her son 's death .
" The military let him down .
The administration let him down .
It was a sign of disrespect .
The fact that he was the ultimate team player and he watched his own men kill him is absolutely heartbreaking and tragic .
The fact that they lied about it afterward is disgusting . "
And , as she reminded us again last spring :
I would like someone to be held accountable .
I ’d like for them to discover and try to discover who was involved with this cover - up .
It ’s a horrible thing that they did .
And I think that if people do n’t see that , it ’s very sad , because it means that we have been numbed to all the lies and deceptions that we ’ve been faced with during these last eight years .

143 of God 's favorite heretic - traps !
- 06-27-2007 , 01:12 AM
06-27-2007 , 01:12 AM
FOR TRUE CHRISTIANS ™ ONLY !
Here is my handly all - purpose article for dealing with heretics .
God put lots of heretic - traps in the Bible , and I 've identified a lot of them .
HOW TO USE GOD'S HERETIC - TRAPS :
Ask the heretic a Biblical question with two true but opposing answers , so if they answer one way , you just give them the opposing scripture .
POOF !
You have now proven your opponent is a heretic who does not know the Bible .
For example :
Ask the heretic " How many days and nights was Christ dead for ? "
If he says three days and nights , quote him this :
Mark 15:25,42,44,45,46 ; 16:9
Which says " two days and two nights "
But if the heretic says " Two days " give him Matt 12:40 which says three days and nights .
God has armed his soldiers well for the war against heresy !

On a day when two leading stock indexes sank to their lowest point in more than a decade , Wall Street did not need the dire problems of banks to lead the way to the bottom .
A broad sell - off on Monday sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 250.89 points and pulled the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index to its lowest close since April 1997 .
In the last five trading days , stocks have fallen about 10 percent .
Unlike in recent weeks , financial stocks did not post the biggest declines .
In fact , battered shares of Citigroup and Bank of America ended higher as the government moved closer toward taking direct ownership stakes in troubled banks .
But the losses piled up everywhere else , providing few signs that would indicate the end of the bear market .
Stocks of technology companies , including Intel , Google and I.B.M. fell , as did scores of retailers , manufacturers and media companies .
The materials sector — makers of raw materials like aluminum , chemicals and plastics — declined the most among the 10 major industries in the S.& P. 500 .

For my previous coverage of this event , go here .
7:04 — As TBNYU ’s new rules bar me from basically every meeting , my voice , the voice going out to the people , is being silenced Dead clever the life and crimes of julie bottomley download .
As I sit far , far away , the protesters scheme and plot while leaving me totally unrepresented .
These kind of scare tactics will not stand !
Here are my demands :
First , I demand to be allowed to continue to blog from here in the occupied space even if I betray TBNYU ’s trust , lie , or commit other egregious ethics violations .
Second , I demand full negotiation plan disclosure .
Third , I demand that a group of NYU Local writers form a new oversight committee with full power to override any TBNYU plans that are deemed bad ideas .
Fourth , I demand a silly antic rate increase of no more than 1 % / year .
Fifth , I demand that 13 NYU Local writers be given full member fee waivers to join TBNYU , including funding for spraypaint and vegan delicacies .
Sixth , I demand that the Taiwanese get all leftover vegan foods .
Whose radical student group ?
OUR RADICAL STUDENT GROUP .
( I kid TBNYU , I kid .
Do n’t throw me out of here — see my first demand ) .
More liveblog after the jump .
7:29 — guy fawkes : “ DEMAND # 7 amendment : Transparency in clothing is an acceptable alternative to transparency in NYU ’s budget . ”
Lol city .
What a day , everyone .
What a day .
7:37 — Mad love to my boys from Ultimate Frisbee , Gabe and Chappy , for getting on the CBS news .
7:40 — Funny , funny stuff in the comments .
@ Anna : Fairly big .
Capacity 319 .
7:43 — Big news .
Various administrators are calling parents of students , alerting them to what their children are doing , and scaring them with “ vague ” threats of punishment to their kids .
7:48 — I ’m a little late to this , but my publisher and editor are debating top people from WSN on WNYU .
Right now they are trying to discredit what I ’ve been doing all day , saying the WSN story is the “ official ” version of the story .
7:54 — You ’re gonna want to check the archives on this WNYU show .
I ’ll post it and twitter it once it archives .
It seems like most of the last meeting was spent talking about meta stuff about the night .
Not much planning or scheming .
New pics coming up shortly .
8:03 — Mood is sour here .
People are on their cellphones , stressing out .
I ’m gonna try to get some interviews here in a minute .
8:10 — Some guy who I ’ve never talked to just came over and , in a threatening voice , told me not to post anything I ’d heard from their meeting .
He actually said , “ Do you understand ? ” Wow I ’m sick of this .
These people need to chill out a little bit , damn .
Anyway , here ’s my blogging territory and view from my blogging territory , respectively :
8:18 — NYU Local publisher ( Cody ) and writer ( Jess ) debated WSN writers on WNYU earlier .
The major point of discussion was the TBNYU occupation coverage .
Check out the whole archived show here .
8:19 — This is the most negative I ’ve seen the group tonight .
I ’m overhearing talks of failure and fear .
People are worried about being arrested and / or expelled .
A little tense in here .
8:23 — @Kristen :
As long as they need to , they say .
However , people keep leaving — that could end up causing trouble .
Which leads me to @ Avery : my current count is 33 .
It ’s definitely dwindled .
8:37 — @ Kate Turtle : I think you ’re right .
The people remaining here are brave ; they are aware of the fact that this probably wo n’t end well .
I ’ve been thinking about what the endgame might look like .
I do n’t foresee negotiations — there has n’t been even an inkling of a serious offer on the part of the administration to talk to the protesters .
I think it could get rough .
Discuss .
8:49 — @ Brett Anon :
It ’s been difficult to tell if there ’s been a guard build - up recently .
I have n’t noticed one , but there are back entrances to Kimmel so it ’s impossible to know .
I think force is n’t out of the option .
The question is how using force will reflect on NYU .
Will they be bashed for refusing to talk or thanked for ending an “ annoying ” occupation ?
Hard to say really .
If you judged by what the consensus seems to be here on this blog , people would n’t be against force .
But remember that groups like TBNYU are a very vocal minority and all those groups will come out of the wood work and raise hell .
I ’m not sure I can make a confident prediction .
@ Dev I : Yes , there will be a midnight protest , says TBNYU .
And big thanks for checking me more than Perez and FB .
Seriously that ’s probably the nicest thing anyone ’s said all night !
lolol
8:57 — BREAKING : More people just busted in through the barricade to join the occupiers .
Video to follow .
9:05 — Lots of people just got in .
Takes a little time to post to YouTube but i’ll have it shortly .
Not surprisingly , people are hyped again .
9:15 — Well over 50 people got in .
Guards are pissed , Bob is red - faced angry .
Guard broke hurt his arm too .
Yikes .
9:21 — Just after the break - in :
This was how they tried to stop 55 people from getting in .
9:27 — Correction : A guard ’s arm was hurt , not broken , and another was hurt as well .
But no broken arms .
I pulled that up out of the comments and did n’t read the WSN piece myself .
TBNYU people and guards confirmed NO break .
9:29 — Video of break - in :
9:33 — Crazy , right ?
55 people did n’t get in though , TBNYU gave me bad numbers .
There ’s a total of 62 people here , according to TBNYU .
I guess I should double check since they just gave me faulty data .
Will have some interviews with new “ occupiers of space ” in a bit .
9:41 — Reports are all over the place .
I just spoke to a guard who told me a male guard hurt his arm badly ( could be broken ) and a female guard hit her head and was hurt .
He said , “ we have to use restraint , you know ? ” I mentioned , “ The cops are gonna be here soon , huh ? ”
He nodded his head strongly yes .
9:49 — New occupiers are introducing themselves to the old guard in a meeting .
WSN reports that ambulance is coming to pick up female guard .
She must have really gotten knocked around .
NOT cool .
9:54 — Via Gmail chat with a friend : “ its funny that they ’ll occupy a building and run past guards and stir up a huge ruckus but they do n’t smoke their ciggarettes insides ”
Quite true .
9:56 — @george alumni : Take Back NYU has no hierarchy , so they do n’t have any specific “ leaders . ”
That said , there are definitely people who have had more to do with this whole operation than others .
See my previous thread with pictures of the negotiating crew — they , I would say , are the larger organizers .
10:03 — @ Mary Rochester :
You ’re right .
I should n’t assume that it ’s bad just because they call an ambulance .
There ’s definitely a lot of secrecy right now on both sides .
It ’s totally possible ( but certainly a cynical view to take ) that the guard is n’t hurt much at all .
@ Eric Levin : Great work , man .
You ’re outposting me .
They ’re still in a meeting here .
3 hours till the big bad 1 AM deadline of doom .
It ’s hard to know if NYU admin are actually going to enforce this deadline , especially now that they allowed such a large breach .
The TBNYUers are reading out loud to the group their update that Eric Levin posted about non-violence .
10:10 — Sounds like arrests will be made after 1 AM and some people may get charged for breaking the door to the balcony .
The clock is ticking …
10:18 — TBNYU is arguing about the language of their non-violence statement .
They seem to be missing the point ..
@ Eric :
No , I have no press pass .
I assume that means I can get rounded up with the protesters ?
10:23 — Meeting is adjourned and TBNYU is now going outside on the balcony yelling again .
I really hope they try the food bucket under the cover of darkness heh heh heh .
10:31 — Serious meeting between TBNYU negotiators and go - betweens ( including Bob ) taking place right now .
Bathroom privileges have been taken away .
@ Matt Nolin : Yes ,
Times reporter is gone .
He left a few hours ago .
10:36 — @ Claire :
Thanks for the support !
I have to say , though , the comments have been ablaze this evening and way more info is flowing through them then through me .
So , props , everyone .
I hope you will all stick around the site once this is all over — there ’s lots to check out .
Oh and that food was really good .
10:50 — Sorry for the long delay .
I talked to some people about a press pass — they do n’t seem to keen on helping me out .
I do n’t think it ’ll be a big deal , particularly since I have n’t participated in any of the blockading / breaking onto the balcony .
You better believe I ’ll get a ton of video if the cops come .
THAT SAID , I ’m hearing that negotiations are in preliminary stages .
Unclear yet what the terms are and who the players are .
If TBNYU does end up sitting down at the table with NYU admins , it will probably because of the bum rush about an hour ago .
Wild stuff will keep you posted .
This is fantastic .
From the comments :
11:06 — Everyone is out on the balcony right now — apparently on the local news .
I ’m still trying to get people to talk to me — there are a number of protesters who strongly dislike me ( for whatever reason ) .
Other protesters have been very kind and told me they really appreciate my presence .
Very strange disconnect .
This is a press break — more discussion about negotiation should resume shortly .
11:12 — On the balcony , shouting at the news :
11:21 — First new occupier interview .
This is Peter Bradley , a comparative literature major in CAS ( ‘09 ) :
Peter did n’t even know about the occupation until tonight when he stepped out of Bobst library ( the one TBNYU wants opened to the public ) for a smoke and saw heavy security at Kimmel .
I asked him why he decided to join the occupation , particularly considering the risks of punishment .
He said that it ’s exciting but “ what ’s important for me is that it can enter into everyone ’s consciousness . ”
He mentioned his time abroad in France in a school system that was cheaper and better run .
Speaking of the American collegiate experience , he says , “ I ’m disillusioned with the cost and the supposed benefit of that cost . ”
He does n’t expect NYU to meet the demands , but says that what ’s important is that they make a statement that “ enters into serious national dialogue . ”
11:37 — Negotiation terms are still being played .
Sounds like it ’s bad news for TBNYU in any case .
There ’s a paddywagon here !
I ’ll try to grab a pic .
11:41 — Bathroom access has been temporarily reinstated , but you have to go in pairs , like the buddy system .
Hall pass anyone ?
Fearless Prediction :
This is all over by 2 AM .
The more little snippets of conversation I hear , the more I think NYU ’s just gonna bring in the NYPD at 1 .
Every “ negotiation ” put on the table by NYU seems to have a “ You ’re outta here by 1 AM tonight ” provision .
11:46 — Overheard : “ Let ’s not get scared , guys . ” == >
Get scared , guys .
11:48 — I am still shut out of the meetings , but I ’m still hearing some TBNYUers talking like they have a real shot at getting demands met .
It ’s just not gonna happen .
There has been no progress thus far .
It ’s really looking bleak .
The administration ’s only offers are unreasonable to TBNYU .
11:54 — “ Negotiations about the negotiations ” have begun .
The administration offered , as a “ favor , ” a “ safe haven ” program which allowed students to leave and get only NYU probation .
TBNYU rejected the offer .
New negotiations have resumed and are currently taking place .
The TBNYUer I spoke with believes the 1 AM deadline is a bluff — she thinks the administration would be crazy to try to arrest students when there is such a big crowd ( a couple hundred , I ’d estimate ) .
12:03 — New thread !
Go here .
It is almost official !
Honda Racing will not disband but will become a private team called Brackley F1 ( name borrowed from the town where the team has its headquarters ) , being taken over by managers Ross Brawn and Nick Fry and financed with money from several sources , among which include the current owner of the team , the Japanese car manufacturer Honda .
Another news is that the British driver Jenson Button will remain with Honda accepting reducing its annual earnings by 50 % , from 11 million to 5.5 million , the alternative being to remain outside the grid to start this season if Honda Racing had been disbanded , the other nine teams letting pilots and already for 2009 .

Rumors over the year it showed the young Bruno Senna , nephew of Ayrton Senna as the second pilot of the Japanese team , but the scale of the challenges that are in 2009 competition veteran Rubens Barrichello could become their colleague ’s Jenson .
Once Honda and announced in December 2008 the total withdrawal from Formula 1 , there were several variants of taking the team , among those interested to the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim , the former manager of the Benetton and BAR team , David Richards , and Tony Teixeira , boss of the A1GP Series .
Last investors interested , Honda officials confirmed , was Virgin Group , owned by British billionaire Richard Branson .
However , Honda Motor president , Takeo Fukui , has said this week that there were numerous discussions on the sale of Formula 1 team , but they were few investors who have thought seriously at buying the team .
So the only remaining option to avoid dissolution Honda Racing Team was the team to be entrusted to the current executive leadership .
British press published on Friday , details about the rescue team , supported ultimately by the Japanese .
This plan provides that Brawn will take over and fry Honda Racing Team , and a part of the budget will be ensured even Honda Motor : an amount equal to that which would have been paid by the Japanese manufacturer for the team dissolved , about 80 million .
Another part of the money will come from Formula One Management , the company owned by Bernie Ecclestone , an advance in the form of television broadcasting rights .
Other amounts may come from various sponsors , who could be “ persuaded ” by a co-optation as a young pilot Bruno Senna , nephew of Ayrton Senna .
The monopost for the 2009 season is ready for more time ; he was tested several times last year , with good results .
Recently , it has been amended to “ get ” with Mercedes engines to be fitted into this season .
Yes , you read right , the Mercedes engines .
According to media in Albion , the official announcement of the participation team in season 2009 World Championship of Formula 1 will be made by March 5 , then Button and his future teammates will participate in a series of private tests at Silverstone .
Then , the team will go to Barcelona , where between 9 and March 12 will take place the last test session before the beginning of the season , scheduled for March 29 in Australia .
But Honda will have the opportunity to “ recover ” the band , where in 2010 - 2011 the auto market will improve and plan for reducing the costs of Formula 1 adopted by the FIA would allow a return .

But Arab foreign ministers said anything less than a binding resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire would be an inadequate response to the crisis , our correspondent says .
If the Arab nations ' response to the draft resolution is positive , a vote could happen later .
The draft calls for an immediate ceasefire , action to stop the smuggling of arms by Hamas across the Egypt - Gaza border and the opening of border crossings into Gaza so aid can be delivered .
At least 765 Palestinian lives are said by sources in Gaza to have been lost since the offensive began 13 days ago .
Three more Israeli soldiers were killed in Thursday , bringing Israel 's death toll to 11 military personnel and three civilians .
A captain and a sergeant were shot dead in separate clashes while a major was killed by an anti-tank missile , Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports .
' Great regret '
Responding to the suspension of aid efforts by the UN relief agency Unrwa , Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said Israel fully supported the work of the UN and other humanitarian agencies in Gaza .
" We will do what needs to be done to facilitate this vital work , " he said .
" In these difficult days we must work together to meet the humanitarian needs of the population . "
Our installations have been hit , our workers have been killed in spite of the fact that the Israeli authorities have the co-ordinates of our facilities

Gaza ' human shields ' criticised
In pictures : Gaza conflict Israelis back Gaza action - for now Conflict hits Egyptian smugglers Unrwa 's move came shortly after it said one person had been killed and two hurt when a fork - lift truck on a UN aid mission came under Israeli tank fire at Gaza 's Erez crossing .
It said it was " with great regret " that it had been forced to make a difficult decision .
" We have suspended our operations in Gaza until the Israeli authorities can guarantee our safety and security , " said Unrwa spokesman Chris Gunness .
" Our installations have been hit , our workers have been killed in spite of the fact that the Israeli authorities have the co-ordinates of our facilities and that all our movements are co-ordinated with the Israeli army . "
The UN said the movements of the truck hit at the Erez crossing had been co-ordinated and cleared with the Israeli military .
The Israeli army has not commented on that claim but has said it is looking into the matter .
In a statement , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the Israeli military 's action .
John Ging , director of operations in Gaza for Unrwa , said a convoy of two UN vehicles and an ambulance had also been fired at - although it was not clear by whom - despite having clearance for its movements from Israel .

The incident occurred as Israel for a second day suspended its military operation for three hours to allow Gazans to find food and bury their dead .
Mr Ging said the Israeli military had to give his staff a credible guarantee of safety .
" If they give us clearance to move then it is wholly and totally unacceptable that their soldiers on the ground are firing on our aid workers , " he said .
A UN spokeswoman said other agencies including the World Health Organization , World Food Programme and Unicef would continue aid operations in Gaza .
The International Committee of the Red Cross has also accused Israel of failing to fulfil its duty to help wounded civilians in Gaza .
The ICRC said its staff had found four weak and scared children beside their mothers ' bodies in houses hit by shelling in Zeitoun .
The Israeli military has not yet responded to the accusation , but said it worked closely with aid groups so that civilians could get assistance .
Meanwhile , Amnesty International accused both Israel and Hamas of using civilians as human shields .
Air strikes
The aid agencies ' concerns come amid fears the conflict with Gaza militants may spread , with at least three rockets fired from Lebanon into northern Israel , prompting Israel to reply with artillery .

The incident followed the heaviest bombardment so far of Gaza in nearly two weeks of conflict , with 60 air strikes which Israel says targeted Hamas facilities .
Palestinian medical officials said at least 10 Gaza residents had been killed on Thursday .
A further 35 bodies were discovered in rubble in conflict areas around Gaza City during the three - hour pause in fighting , a health ministry official said .
Amid continuing efforts to broker a ceasefire , a senior Israeli official has gone to Cairo to hear details of a plan put forward by Egypt and France .

At least three Katyusha rockets were fired from southern Lebanon into the northern Israeli area of Nahariya early on Thursday .
One hit a nursing home , injuring at least two people .
Israel immediately responded with five artillery shells into Lebanon , calling it a " pinpoint response at the source of fire " .
The rocket fire was condemned by Lebanon 's prime minister .
A senior Hezbollah politician , Lebanon 's energy minister , said the militant group was not responsible for the attacks .
Casualty claims in Gaza have been difficult to verify independently .
While the BBC's Palestinian producers have been reporting from Gaza , Israel allowed Western TV crews to enter only on Wednesday , embedded with its army .

DUBAI , United Arab Emirates ( CNN ) --
The United Arab Emirates has refused to grant a visa to a female Israeli tennis player , preventing her from competing in the Sony Ericsson World Tennis Association Tour in Dubai , the WTA said in a statement Sunday .
The UAE has refused to grant a visa allowing Shahar Peer to compete in Dubai .
Shahar Peer would have been the first Israeli athlete to participate in a professional sporting event in the UAE , CNN Sports correspondent Pedro Pinto said .
The UAE has no diplomatic ties with Israel .
Peer told CNN on Sunday evening she was " very , very disappointed " to be denied access to the tournament .
" Any player that qualifies should attend , and I was prevented , " she said from Israel .
" I 'm glad the WTA support me .
A red line was crossed for every athlete in the world -- politics should be kept separate from sports . "
The governing body of women 's tennis said it was " deeply disappointed " that Peer was being denied entry to the country hosting the tournament , but it did not cancel the competition , which began Sunday .
The move runs counter to WTA policy , which says no player should be barred from competing in a tournament for which she has qualified .
Dubai could lose its membership in the WTA tour next year over the ban on Peer , according to WTA rules .
That would mean professional players could compete only in exhibition matches in Dubai , the results of which would not count in pro rankings .
Government officials in Dubai have not responded to CNN 's request to comment over their refusal to allow Peer to compete in the event .
" Ms. Peer has earned the right to play in the tournament , and it is regrettable that the UAE is denying her this right , " said Larry Scott , chairman and chief executive of the tour .
Watch Scott express disappointment »
" Following various consultations , the tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week , pending further review by the tour 's board of directors . "
The patron of the Dubai Tennis Championships is Dubai 's ruler , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al - Makhtoum .
Two million dollars in prize money is on the line .
Al - Makhtoum told CNN in 2004 that Dubai would accept Israeli students to a school dedicated to students from the Middle East who are talented at sports .
In 2003 , Dubai hosted World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings , which Israeli government officials attended .
The Israeli flag -- among other member states ' flags -- is still part of a globe monument in Dubai .
Peer , 21 , is ranked 48th in the world among female tennis players .
She was allowed to compete at the Doha tournament in Qatar last year , where she received a warm welcome , according to Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz .
Qatar , another Gulf Arab state , froze diplomatic ties with Israel after Israel 's military offensive in Gaza last month .
Peer downplayed the political undertones of her participation in last year 's Doha tournament , telling Haaretz that she did n't come to Qatar " to help the politics of course . "
But she added that if her playing in the tournament " can help for peace or anything , I 'd be really happy . "
Scott said the tour will " review appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer " as well as " appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament . "
Peer was advised Saturday by tournament and WTA officials of the denial of her visa while she was participating in a tournament in Pattaya , Thailand , according to a WTA statement .
The Dubai Tennis Championships runs through February 28 .

Feb . 1 , 2009  --
Less than two months ago , Bernard Madoff was arrested by the FBI for securities fraud .
Given the relative amounts of money involved and pain inflicted , Ponzi schemes should perhaps henceforth be called Madoff schemes .
Whatever their outward appearance , almost all such scams involve collecting money from an initial group of investors by promising them solid and sometimes extraordinary returns .
The returns to the initial group come from money contributed by a larger secondary group of people .
A still larger group of people contributes to both of the smaller earlier groups , and so on .
This burgeoning process continues for a while , but the number of people needed to keep the pyramid growing and the money coming in increases exponentially and soon becomes difficult to maintain .
People drop out , and the easy marks become scarcer .
The system collapses under its own weight when enough new people can no longer be found .
Dot -Coms , Mortgages , Our Genes and the Environment
The logic is clear , but the situation gets more interesting when many people are suspicious of the scheme or even aware of its fraudulence ( as they were not with Ponzi or Madoff ) .
In this case they generally worry only about what happens one or two steps ahead and may anticipate being able to get out before a collapse .
That is , one may find it rational to buy into such an unsavory scheme if one is confident of recruiting a " bigger sucker " as a replacement .
The dot - coms ' meteoric stock price rises in the late '90s and their subsequent precipitous declines in 2000 and 2001 were attenuated versions of the same general sort of scam .
There was a degree of knowingness among some investors about the unsustainability of the boom .
They tried to get in on the initial public offering , hold on as the stock rocketed upward , and jump off before it plummeted .
Thanks to complicated derivatives and other opaque financial instruments , the recent collapse in the housing market and the more general financial crisis it has precipitated have an even more repellent aroma to them , if I may Ponzificate a bit .
While corporate venality and fraud certainly played a role in some of these precipitous declines , the collapses of the various dot-coms , banks , foundations and financial institutions were not primarily the fault of con artists and high - society lowlifes .
The responsibility extends far wider .
Even when investors recognized bubbles ( or outright swindles ) for what they were , most figured , usually incorrectly , that they'd be able to find a chair when the mania - inducing music stopped .
Maybe our genes are to blame .
( They always seem to get the rap . )
Natural selection no doubt favors organisms that respond to local or near - term events and ignore distant or future ones , which are discounted in somewhat the same way that future money is .
We want tasty food now regardless of distant health consequences .
The ravaging of the environment also may be seen as a kind of unintentional global Ponzi scheme .
The early " investors " ( the beneficiaries of the fossil fuels , rapid deforestation , water and air pollution , etc. ) did well , later ones have fared less well , and a catastrophe may wipe out all " investment gains . "
The Imp in the Bottle
A quite different illustration of our short - sightedness comes courtesy of Robert Louis Stevenson 's " The Imp in the Bottle . "
The story tells of a genie in a bottle able and willing to satisfy your every romantic whim and financial desire .
You 're offered the opportunity to buy this bottle and its amazing denizen at a price of your choice .
There is a serious limitation , however .
When you 've finished with the bottle , you have to sell it to someone else at a price strictly less than what you paid for it .
If you do n't sell it to someone for a lower price , you will lose everything and will suffer excruciating and unrelenting torment .
What would you pay for such a bottle ?
Certainly you would n't pay 1 cent because then you would n't be able to sell it for a lower price .
You would n't pay 2 cents for it either since no one would buy it from you for 1 cent since everyone knows that it must be sold for a price less than the price at which it is bought .
The same reasoning shows that you would n't pay 3 cents for it since the person to whom you would have to sell it for 2 cents would object to buying it at that price since he would n't be able to sell it for 1 cent .
Likewise for prices of 4 cents , 5 cents , 6 cents , and so on .
We can use mathematical induction to formalize this argument , which proves conclusively that you would n't buy the genie in the bottle for any amount of money .
Yet you would almost certainly buy it for 1,000 dollars .
I know I would .
At what point does the argument against buying the bottle cease to be compelling ?
The question is more than academic since in countless situations people prepare exclusively for near - term outcomes and do n't look very far ahead .
They myopically discount the future at an absurdly steep rate .
On the other hand , in certain quite different circumstances this tendency can also be seen as a rationally exuberant " seize the day " mentality that has much to recommend it .
Live large before the music stops ... but be a little skeptical .

ROTHERA BASE , Antarctica ( Reuters ) - Fifty years into a treaty demanding all scientific findings on Antarctica be freely shared , governments are trying to end a dispute over a surge in company patents on life in the continent .
An increasing number of companies developing new products through biological discovery or “ bioprospecting ” are trying to file patents on Antarctic organisms or molecules for items from cosmetics to medicines , putting new strains on the treaty .
“ Biology is going through a revolution ... it ’s a tricky situation , ” Jose Retamales , head of the Chilean Antarctic Institute , said of the lack of clear rules for prospecting for animals and plants on the continent .
Parties to the 1959 Antarctic Treaty plan to debate issues including bioprospecting at an annual meeting commemorating “ 50 years of peace and science ” in the U.S. city of Baltimore from April 6 - 17 .
They have agreed to submit suggestions by February 20 .
“ We need to find out if it is a problem and if so , what is the problem , ” said Johannes Huber , head of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat in Buenos Aires .
Governments “ have not found a consensus , ” he added .
The treaty setting the continent aside for peace and science was originally intended to defuse bigger conflicts over territorial claims during the Cold War , Retamales said .
“ The world has changed .
Now we are talking about different things -- things you do not even see . ”
The treaty forbids mining but permits other commercial uses of Antarctica .
Bioprospecting is allowed , unless it has military goals .
Retamales and several other experts said a desire by companies for patents -- securing them exclusive commercial rights -- was often hard to square with goals of openness and shared science laid out in the 47 - nation treaty .
The treaty says : “ Scientific observations and results from Antarctica shall be exchanged and made freely available . ”
All plans for scientific programs should be exchanged in advance to ensure efficiency and economy , it adds .
Products derived from Antarctica include dietary supplements , anti-freeze proteins , anti-cancer drugs , enzymes and cosmetic creams .
Advances in genetic technologies make Antarctic “ bioprospecting ” easier .
FACE CREAM
“ Using genetic resources means very often that you are having an economic activity for a company , ” said Yves Frenot , deputy head of the French Polar Institute .
“ That is difficult to reconcile with ... the Antarctic Treaty . ”
“ More and more companies are looking to Antarctica , ” said Sam Johnston , a senior research fellow at the U.N. University ’s ( UNU ) Institute of Advanced Studies .
“ We expect this trend to accelerate , ” he said .
Antarctic organisms have evolved attractive characteristics for industry , such as conserving energy and surviving in a deep freeze .
Dozens of companies including consumer products groups Procter & Gamble and Unilever , French cosmetics group Clarins and Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk are in a UNU database of almost 200 “ bioprospecting ” bodies .
Clarins , for instance , uses an algae -- Durvillea antarctica -- in a face cream , the database says .
Unilever has a patent based on an anti-freeze protein in a bacteria found in an Antarctic lake that may help keep ice cream smooth .
Johnston said there were similar trends of more research into organisms found in the high seas and on the deep seabed , despite uncertainties about rights outside national waters .
In Antarctica , all territorial claims are on hold under the treaty .
Coastal regions of Antarctica , like that around the British Rothera research station on the Antarctic Peninsula , teem with life , from penguins and whales to lichens and microbes .
“ Our view is that we ca n’t patent organisms themselves but we can have patents on processes discovered in Antarctic organisms , ” said Pete Convey , a Rothera station biologist .
Frenot said doubts about the treaty should not block a cancer treatment , for instance , found in an Antarctic creature or plant and patented after costly research by a company .
“ It would be a pity not to use such resources , but there are no rules .
We have to invent those rules , ” he said .
EXOTIC FORMS
Part of the attraction of Antarctica is that it separated from South America more than 30 million years ago and life has evolved with few outside influences .
“ You ’d have to go to Mars or perhaps another planet ” to find species so different from those elsewhere in the world , said Retamales .
Uncharted lakes beneath Antarctica ’s ice sheets , such as Vostok Lake that Russia hopes to drill into , may contain even more exotic life forms .
Much current research involves studying cells , for instance of microbes found by a government scientific agency and later grown in a corporate laboratory far from the Antarctic .
That means there are few expeditions that might harm the environment .
Johnston said there were worries -- but no evidence -- that corporate involvement might make researchers delay publication of key scientific findings until patent applications were filed .
He said one idea was to tax profits from Antarctic - based products and plough cash back into Antarctic science , with special help for poor countries .
The United States and Japan seemed most reluctant to impose rules that would limit corporate access , he said .
Many Antarctic patents go beyond animals or plants .
Norway ’s Aker Biomarine , which produces a dietary supplement made from krill , has patents covering technology for processing the shrimp - like crustaceans that can quickly rot .
The patents “ are not really relevant to scientific research under the Antarctic Treaty , ” said spokesman Geir Arne Drangeid .
Director Victor Solomon has spent lord knows how long knitting together every instance of swearing in every episode of The Sopranos .
I do n't know why either .
Solomon said on his own site that the video shows those who watch on heavily censored A&E TV just what they 're missing .
We 'll all have our favourites : I recommend keeping an eye out for the small girl in the car , ' you are speaking shit to me ' and ' little Lord Shit Pants ' .
The result is 27 minutes and 18 seconds of John Cage - esque expletivism .
It 's a very slick edit with some comedy touches - but it 's still a whole load of fucking shit .

According to Finkelstein , Israel , a state built on the ashes of the Holocaust , is now committing a holocaust against Palestinians in Gaza .
In a telephone interview with Today 's Zaman , Finkelstein said Israel was a " terrorist state " created by the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948 .
Praising Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the Turkish people for their courage in supporting Palestinians , Finkelstein referred to Israel as a " satanic " and " lunatic " state .
Finkelstein 's parents survived the Nazi camps in World War II and then immigrated to the US .
After his book “ The Holocaust Industry , ” in which he accused many prominent Jewish leaders of abusing the victims of the Holocaust , was published , Finkelstein was almost declared persona non grata by America ’s influential Zionist circles .
What does Israel want to achieve with this operation ?
Basically , Israel wants to achieve two goals : to restore what it calls its deterrence capacity -- that means to spread fear among Arab states about itself .
This is a core principle of Israeli strategic doctrine .
Arab states have to be afraid of Israel , afraid of its military might , and Arabs should do what Israelis want .
They shall follow Israeli orders .
Israel ’s military deterrence suffered a setback in May 2000 , when Hezbullah succeeded to expel Israeli occupying forces from south Lebanon .
Almost immediately in the aftermath of the failure , Israel planned another war with Hezbullah to re-establish its deterrence capacity .
In 2006 , after long preparation and using its air force , Israel suffered another ignominious defeat in Lebanon against Hezbullah .
The second goal was to defeat the Palestinian peace offensive .
This has been another basic principle of Israeli doctrine :
You do not negotiate with Arabs .
You give them orders .
The Palestinian organization Hamas was becoming too moderate ; it was transmitting , giving the signal that it was ready to go along with the two - state settlement based on pre-1967 borders .
The leadership of Syria and the West Bank have also been making statements like this .
So Israel started to get worried that it would be obliged to negotiate a settlement which the international community has been supporting for the last 30 years .
‘ While the rest of the world wants peace , Europe wants peace , the US wants peace , but this state wants war , war and war .
In the first week of the massacres , there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran .
Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon .
It is a lunatic state ’
Those who are against this settlement are the US or Israel , backed by the US .
So when Hamas was becoming moderate and holding to the cease - fire it agreed in June 2008 , it was showing herself to be a credible negotiating partner .
Hamas was standing by its word .
In the meantime , Israel has neglected another core principle of cease - fire , namely easing the blockade .
So Israel had to defeat this Palestinian peace offensive .
It always does this .
It provokes Palestinians into reacting , and it wants to either destroy Hamas or inflicts so much damage that Hamas will have to say it will never negotiate with Israel .
That is exactly what Israel wants .
Israel never wants a moderate negotiating partner because if there is one , pressure on Israel will grow .
Hamas is willing for a settlement ; Hamas stands by its word .
But Israel does not want to negotiate .
What you are basically saying is that Israel is not interested in peace at all .
Israel wants peace in its terms , and its terms are that West Bank should belong to their state .
Will the operation be successful ?
First of all , we have to use proper language .
There is no operation , and there is no war .
What is happening is a slaughter , a massacre .
When you have 200 to 300 kids killed , that is not a war .
When you have a strong military going in against a defenseless population , that is not a war .
When you shoot a fish in a barrel , we do not call it a war .
As an Israeli columnist put it , it does not need too much courage to send jets and helicopter gunships to shoot inside a prison .
What just happened was not a war .
One - third of the casualties were children .
It was not a war ; it was a just a massacre .
In terms of the Israelis ’ goals , you have to say it was successful .
It inspired fear among Palestinians and Arabs generally that Israel is a lunatic state and that you have to follow its orders .
No. 2 , it destroys Hamas as a negotiating partner .
You now hear from Hamas that it will not negotiate peace .
That is what Israel wanted .
On your Web site , there is an argument that the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors are doing to the Palestinians exactly what was done to them by the Nazis .
Do you agree with that ?
I think Israel , as a number of commentators pointed out , is becoming an insane state .
And we have to be honest about that .
While the rest of the world wants peace , Europe wants peace , the US wants peace , but this state wants war , war and war .
In the first week of the massacres , there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran .
Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon .
It is a lunatic state .
But do you agree with the characterization ?
Look at the pictures and decide for yourself .
I am not going to tell people what they should think about it .
But what I say is they should look at the pictures and decide for themselves .
( For the pictures go to : http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&ar=2510)
Why have you been barred from entering Israel for 10 years ?
As the son of Holocaust survivors , you cannot enter Israel .
Let ’s be clear on a certain point .
I was not entering Israel ; I have no interest in going to Israel .
I was going to see my friends in the occupied Palestinian territories .
And Israel blocked me to go and see my friends in the West Bank .
Under international law , I do not think they have any right to do that !
I was not posing any security threat to Israel .
The day after I was denied entering Israel , the editorial of Haaretz was asking , “ Who is afraid of Norman Finkelstein ? ”
They were also saying that I was not a security threat .
I do not have any particular interest to go and visit that lunatic state .
There are Jewish intellectuals who now call Israel a “ terrorist state . ”
Is that a correct naming ?
I am not sure how you cannot agree with that .
The goal of the operation was to terrorize the civilian population so that Palestinians would be afraid of Israel .
This is the dictionary definition of terrorism .
The dictionary definition of terrorism is targeting a civilian population to achieve a political goal .
The goal of this operation or rather massacre was to terrorize the civilian population and to wreck and destroy as much civilian infrastructure such that the Palestinians would submit .
When you attack schools , mosques , ambulances , hospitals , UN relief organizations , what is that ?
If this is not terrorism , then what is terrorism ?
In your famous book , “ The Holocaust Industry , ” you argue that the state of Israel , one of the world ’s most formidable military powers , with a horrendous human rights record , cast itself as a victim state in order to garner immunity to criticism .
Have we seen this during the Gaza operation ?
They tried to use the Holocaust ; it was funny in a very sick way .
The leader of the American Jewish Committee , David Harris , wrote an article , and he said it is no coincidence that this war in Gaza is occurring around Jan. 27 , which is Holocaust Remembrance Day .
He wants to pretend some connection .
In fact there is a connection , and the connection is Israel is committing a holocaust in Gaza .
But that is not the connection he had in mind .
He wanted to play the Holocaust card ; I think that it is not working very much anymore .
It was clear that during this last massacre in Gaza , liberal Jewish public opinion turned against Israel .
If you look at the petitions , demonstrations , letters , support to Israel , not only in the international community but also among the Jewish community , is diminishing .
So the Holocaust card , the anti-Semitic card , is not working as efficiently as it was working once .
You will probably be called anti-Semitic as well .
I do not think this propaganda is successful anymore .
In your book “ Beyond Chutzpah , ” you argue that Israel was created after the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians , but the question whether it was premeditated remains to be answered .
If it is premeditated , then can it be called genocide ?
Well , it was premeditated , and I think the record is pretty clear .
Even Israel ’s former minister of foreign affairs , Shlomo Ben -Ami , in his book published several years ago called “ Scars of War , ” said that it was quite clear that it was a premeditated expulsion in 1948 and it was anchored in the Zionist philosophy of transfer .
Ethnic cleansings are ethnic cleansings , and they are war crimes .
Why do you think US media is so one - sided and so pro-Israeli ?
I think it has two components .
First of all , Israel serves American interests in the region and American media always give a free pass to those states that serve American interests .
That is the overall picture and not much different from other parts of the world .
The horrendous governments like Saudi Arabia , Egypt , they also get free passes in the American media .
This is the larger context .
And there is , of course , the secondary factor , which is the ethnic element .
In many of these newspapers and the media in general , there is a large Jewish presence , and there is a sense of Jewish ethnic solidarity , which plays a role .
But I think we have to qualify the secondary factor in two ways .
We should not lose sight of the primary factor , which is Israel is the client state of US .
No .
2 : In this past war , the liberal Jewish population mostly under the age of 40 completely defected from the war , the massacre .
They have been opposed to the massacres from the first day .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been very critical of Israel on Gaza , and some American circles lambasted him in return .
What do you think about his stance ?
I wish he had done further .
I wish he had gone as far as Qatar , Mauritania , Bolivia and Venezuela in breaking diplomatic relations with that lunatic state .
But as far as he has gone , the point on which he stands , has been terrific .
And I was glad to see Hamas respected the gestures of the Turkish government and said they would be willing to have Turkish troops stationed on “ our border . ”
That is a very high praise for the Turkish government .
Turks are showing Palestinians compassion , decency and justice .
All the Turkish people should take pride of this stance as was the case on the eve of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
It was the Turkish people and government who showed courage .
Ninety - six percent of Turkish people opposed the war in Iraq .
The Turkish government refused to give Americans use of their land to attack Iraq .
Now Turkish people and Turkish government are redeeming themselves again by standing on what is right , what is decent and what is just .
I say the highest praise for Erdoğan and the Turkish people .
How do you feel about Israel ’s operation in Gaza personally as the son of Holocaust survivors ?
It has been a long time since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel , which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious , murderous wars .
It is a vandal state .
There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph .
Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer .
I feel no emotion of affinity with that state .
I have some good friends and their families there , and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt .
That said , sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils of the hell , a satanic state .
Ninety percent of the population continues to cheer , to exalt and feel proud and heroic .
They send a Sherman tank to a playground and torch children .
Is this heroism ?
Is this courage ?
You were not allowed to teach at DePaul University despite a very good academic record and also had some problems in getting your Ph.D. from Princeton .
Why ?
Well , I had some problems .
I really cannot discuss my problems in the face of what is going on in Gaza .
It will be so silly , trivial and stupid .
Three hundred or so children -- they were incinerated to death ; phosphor bombs were thrown indiscriminately over Gaza .
Everything these people wanted to rebuild , rebuild and rebuild was destroyed again .
This state invaded in 1978 , again in 1982 , again in 1993 , again in 1996 , again in 2006 , and 2008 , and it always destroys , destroys and destroys .
And then these satanic narcissistic people throw their hands up in the air and ask , “ Why does n’t anybody love us ?
Why do n’t our neighbors want us to be here ? ”
Why would they ?

Look Ma , no locks !

When more than one thread accesses a mutable variable , all threads must use synchronization , or else some very bad things can happen .
The primary means of synchronization in the Java language is the synchronized keyword ( also known as intrinsic locking ) , which enforces mutual exclusion and ensures that the actions of one thread executing a synchronized block are visible to other threads that later execute a synchronized block protected by the same lock .
When used properly , intrinsic locking can make our programs thread - safe , but locking can be a relatively heavyweight operation when used to protect short code paths when threads frequently contend for the lock .
In " Going atomic , " we looked at atomic variables , which provide atomic read - modify - write operations for safely updating shared variables without locks .
Atomic variables have memory semantics similar to that of volatile variables , but because they can also be modified atomically , they can be used as the basis for lock - free concurrent algorithms .
A nonblocking counter
Counter in Listing 1 is thread - safe , but the need to use a lock irks some developers because of the performance cost involved .
But the lock is needed because increment , though it looks like a single operation , is shorthand for three separate operations : fetch the value , add one to it , and write the value out .
( Synchronization is also needed on the getValue method , to ensure that threads calling getValue see an up - to - date value .
Simply ignoring the need for locking is not a good strategy , though many developers seem disturbingly willing to convince themselves that this approach is acceptable . )
When multiple threads ask for the same lock at the same time , one wins and acquires the lock , and the others block .
JVMs typically implement blocking by suspending the blocked thread and rescheduling it later .
The resulting context switches can cause a significant delay relative to the few instructions protected by the lock .
Listing 1 . A thread - safe counter using synchronization
public final class Counter { private long value = 0 ; public synchronized long getValue ( ) { return value ; } public synchronized long increment ( ) { return ++ value ; } }
NonblockingCounter in Listing 2 shows one of the simplest nonblocking algorithms : a counter that uses the compareAndSet ( ) ( CAS ) method of AtomicInteger .
The compareAndSet ( ) method says " Update this variable to this new value , but fail if some other thread changed the value since I last looked . "
( See " Going atomic " for more explanation of atomic variables and compare - and - set . )
Listing 2 . A nonblocking counter using CAS
public class NonblockingCounter { private AtomicInteger value ; public int getValue ( ) { return value.get ( ) ; } public int increment ( ) { int v ; do { v = value.get ( ) ; } while (!value.compareAndSet( v , v + 1 ) ) ; return v + 1 ; } }
The atomic variable classes are called atomic because they provide for fine - grained atomic updates of numbers and object references , but they are also atomic in the sense that they are the basic building blocks for nonblocking algorithms .
Nonblocking algorithms have been the subject of much research and study for over 20 years but have only become possible in the Java language as of Java 5.0 .
Modern processors provide special instructions for atomically updating shared data that can detect interference from other threads , and compareAndSet ( ) uses these instead of locking .
( If all we wanted to do was increment the counter , AtomicInteger offers methods for incrementing , but they are based on compareAndSet ( ) just like NonblockingCounter.increment ( ) . )
The nonblocking version has several performance advantages over the lock - based version .
It synchronizes at a finer level of granularity ( an individual memory location ) using a hardware primitive instead of the JVM locking code path , and losing threads can retry immediately rather than being suspended and rescheduled .
The finer granularity reduces the chance that there will be contention , and the ability to retry without being descheduled reduces the cost of contention .
Even with a few failed CAS operations , this approach is still likely to be faster than being rescheduled because of lock contention .
NonblockingCounter may be a simple example , but it illustrates a basic characteristic of all nonblocking algorithms -- some algorithmic step is executed speculatively , with the knowledge that it may have to be redone if the CAS is not successful .
Nonblocking algorithms are often called optimistic because they proceed with the assumption that there will be no interference .
If interference is detected , they back off and retry .
In the case of the counter , the speculative step is the increment -- it fetches and adds one to the old value in the hopes that the value will not change while the update is being computed .
If it is wrong , it has to fetch the value again and redo the increment computation .
A nonblocking stack
A less trivial example of a nonblocking algorithm is ConcurrentStack in Listing 3 .
The push ( ) and pop ( ) operations in ConcurrentStack are both structurally similar to increment ( ) in NonblockingCounter , speculatively doing some work and hoping that the underlying assumptions have not been invalidated when it comes time to " commit " that work .
The push ( ) method observes the current top node , constructs a new node to be pushed on the stack , and then , if the topmost node has not changed since the initial observation , installs the new node .
If the CAS fails , it means that another thread has modified the stack , so the process starts again .
Listing 3 . Nonblocking stack using Treiber 's algorithm
public class ConcurrentStack <E> { AtomicReference < Node <E >> head = new AtomicReference < Node <E >>( ) ; public void push ( E item ) { Node < E > newHead = new Node <E >( item ) ; Node < E > oldHead ; do { oldHead = head.get ( ) ; newHead.next = oldHead ; } while ( !head.compareAndSet(oldHead , newHead ) ) ; } public E pop ( ) { Node < E > oldHead ; Node < E> newHead ; do { oldHead = head.get ( ) ; if ( oldHead == null ) return null ; newHead = oldHead.next ; } while ( !head.compareAndSet(oldHead,newHead ) ) ; return oldHead.item ; } static class Node < E > { final E item ; Node < E > next ; public Node ( E item ) { this .item = item ; } } }
Performance considerations
Under light to moderate contention , nonblocking algorithms tend to outperform blocking ones because most of the time the CAS succeeds on the first try , and the penalty for contention when it does occur does not involve thread suspension and context switching , just a few more iterations of the loop .
An uncontended CAS is less expensive than an uncontended lock acquisition ( this statement has to be true because an uncontended lock acquisition involves a CAS plus additional processing ) , and a contended CAS involves a shorter delay than a contended lock acquisition .
Under high contention -- when many threads are pounding on a single memory location -- lock - based algorithms start to offer better throughput than nonblocking ones because when a thread blocks , it stops pounding and patiently waits its turn , avoiding further contention .
However , contention levels this high are uncommon , as most of the time threads interleave thread - local computation with operations that contend for shared data , giving other threads a chance at the shared data .
( Contention levels this high also indicate that reexamining your algorithm with an eye towards less shared data is in order . )
The graph in " Going atomic " was somewhat confusing in this regard , as the program being measured was so unrealistically contention - intensive that it appeared that locks were a win for even small numbers of threads .
A nonblocking linked list
The examples so far -- counter and stack -- are very simple nonblocking algorithms and are easy to follow once you grasp the pattern of using CAS in a loop .
For more sophisticated data structures , nonblocking algorithms are much more complicated than these simple examples because modifying a linked list , tree , or hash table can involve updating more than one pointer .
CAS enables atomic conditional updates on a single pointer , but not on two .
So to construct a nonblocking linked list , tree , or hash table , we need to find a way to update multiple pointers with CAS without leaving the data structure in an inconsistent state .
Inserting an element at the tail of a linked list typically involves updating two pointers : the " tail " pointer that always refers to the last element in the list and the " next " pointer from the previous last element to the newly inserted element .
Because two pointers need to be updated , two CASes are needed .
Updating two pointers in separate CAS operations introduces two potential problems that need to be considered : what happens if the first CAS succeeds but the second fails , and what happens if another thread attempts to access the list between the first and second CAS .
The " trick " to building nonblocking algorithms for nontrivial data structures is to make sure that the data structure is always in a consistent state , even between the time that a thread starts modifying the data structure and the time it finishes , and to make sure that other threads can tell not only whether the first thread has finished its update or is still in the middle of it , but also what operations would be required to complete the update if the first thread went AWOL .
If a thread arrives on the scene to find the data structure in the middle of an update , it can " help " the thread already performing the update by finishing the update for it , and then proceeding with its own operation .
When the first thread gets around to trying to finish its own update , it will realize that the work is no longer necessary and just return because the CAS will detect the interference ( in this case , constructive interference ) from the helping thread .
This " help thy neighbor " requirement is needed to make the data structure resistant to the failure of individual threads .
If a thread arrived to find the data structure in mid-update by another thread and just waited until that thread finished its update , it could wait forever if the other thread fails in the middle of its operation .
Even in the absence of failure , this approach would offer poor performance because the newly arriving thread would have to yield the processor , incurring a context switch , or wait for its quantum to expire , which is even worse .
LinkedQueue in Listing 4 shows the insertion operation for the Michael - Scott nonblocking queue algorithm , which is implemented by ConcurrentLinkedQueue :
Listing 4 . Insertion in the Michael - Scott nonblocking queue algorithm
public class LinkedQueue < E > { private static class Node < E > { final E item ; final AtomicReference < Node <E >> next ; Node ( E item , Node < E > next ) { this .item = item ; this .
next = new AtomicReference < Node <E >>( next ) ; } } private AtomicReference < Node <E >> head = new AtomicReference < Node <E >>( new Node < E >( null , null ) ) ; private AtomicReference < Node <E >> tail = head ; public boolean put( E item ) { Node < E > newNode = new Node < E >( item , null ) ; while ( true ) { Node < E> curTail = tail.get ( ) ; Node < E> residue = curTail.next.get ( ) ; if ( curTail == tail.get ( ) ) { if ( residue == null ) /* A */ { if ( curTail.next.compareAndSet( null , newNode ) ) /* C */ { tail.compareAndSet(curTail , newNode ) /* D */ ; return true ; } } else { tail.compareAndSet(curTail , residue ) /* B */ ; } } } } }
Like many queue algorithms , an empty queue consists of a single dummy node .
The head pointer always points to the dummy node ; the tail pointer always points to either the last node or the second - to - last node .
Figure 1 illustrates a queue with two elements under normal conditions :
As Listing 4 shows , inserting an element involves two pointer updates , both of which are done with CAS : linking the new node from the current last node on the queue ( C ) and swinging the tail pointer to point to the new last node ( D ) .
If the first of these fails , then the queue state is unchanged , and the inserting thread retries until it succeeds .
Once that operation succeeds , the insertion is considered to have taken effect , and other threads can see the modification .
It still remains to swing the tail pointer to point to the new node , but this task can be considered " cleanup " because any thread that arrives on the scene can tell whether such cleanup is needed and knows how to do it .
The queue is always in one of two states : the normal , or quiescent , state ( Figure 1 and Figure 3 ) or the intermediate state ( Figure 2 ) .
The queue is in the quiescent state before an insertion operation and after the second CAS ( D ) succeeds ; it is in the intermediate state after the first CAS ( C ) succeeds .
In the quiescent state , the next field of the link node pointed to by the tail is always null ; in the intermediate state , it is always non-null .
Any thread can tell which state the queue is in by comparing tail .
next to null , which is the key to enabling threads to help other threads " finish " their operation .
The insertion operation first checks to see if the queue is in the intermediate state before attempting to insert a new element ( A ) , as shown in Listing 4 .
If it is , then some other thread must already be in the middle of inserting an element , between steps ( C ) and ( D ) .
Rather than wait for the other thread to finish , the current thread can " help " it out by finishing the operation for it by moving the tail pointer forward ( B ) .
It keeps checking the tail pointer and advancing it if necessary until the queue is in the quiescent state , at which point it can begin its own insertion .
The first CAS ( C ) could fail because two threads are contending for access to the current last element of the queue ; in this case , no change has taken effect , and any threads that lose the CAS reload the tail pointer and try again .
If the second CAS ( D ) fails , the inserting thread does not need to retry -- because another thread has completed the operation for it in step ( B ) !
Nonblocking algorithms under the hood
If you dive into the JVM and OS , you 'll find nonblocking algorithms everywhere .
The garbage collector uses them to accelerate concurrent and parallel garbage collection ; the scheduler uses them to efficiently schedule threads and processes and to implement intrinsic locking .
In Mustang ( Java 6.0 ) , the lock - based SynchronousQueue algorithm is being replaced with a new nonblocking version .
Few developers use SynchronousQueue directly , but it is used as the work queue for thread pools constructed with the Executors.newCachedThreadPool ( ) factory .
Benchmark tests comparing cached thread pool performance show that the new nonblocking synchronous queue implementation offers close to three times the speed over the current implementation .
And further improvements are planned for the release following Mustang , codenamed Dolphin .
Summary
Nonblocking algorithms tend to be far more complicated than lock - based ones .
Developing nonblocking algorithms is a rather specialized discipline , and it can be extremely difficult to prove their correctness .
But many of the advances in concurrent performance across Java versions come from the use of nonblocking algorithms , and as concurrent performance becomes even more important , expect to see more nonblocking algorithms used in future releases of the Java platform .
