You can see the carbon emissions rising by the day over the skyline of Guangzhou , where armies of construction workers are busy throwing up skyscrapers that will soon surpass anything in New York in terms of height and ­energy consumption .
Pearl River Tower in Guangzhou , China .

It is the same story all over China where , despite the economic crisis , engineers are completing four more tower blocks every day – almost all fitted with air conditioning , heating , lighting and lifts that will run on coal - powered electricity .
The country is in the middle of the greatest building boom in human history .
Six of the world 's 10 tallest buildings completed last year were in China , including the 492 - metre - tall Shanghai World Financial Centre .
Even taller structures are on their way – such as the Shanghai Centre , 632 metres , and at 600 metres , the Goldin Finance 117 in Tianjin .
But among the giants there is one that could hold out hope for a low - carbon future .
The Pearl River Tower , now being erected in Guangzhou , the provincial capital of Guangdong province , is being billed as the most energy efficient superskyscraper ever built .
With wind turbines , solar panels , ­sun - shields , smart lighting , water - cooled ceilings and state - of - the - art insulation , the 310 - metre tower is designed to use half the energy of most buildings of its size and set a new global benchmark for self - sufficiency among the planet 's high rises .
Engineers say the tower could even be enhanced to create surplus electricity if the local power firm relaxes its monopoly over energy generation .
Due for completion in October 2010 , the structure currently looks no different from the many other masses of steel and concrete that are reaching for the sky in Guangzhou .
The horizon is rising fast and grey in China 's wealthiest province .
By the time the Asian games begin next year , the provincial capital will boast a 432 - metre - high TV tower , excluding its 150 - metre antenna , and the 391 - metre Zhongxin Plaza .
Both structures will be bigger than any building in New York .
While Dubai and other cities in the Middle East are building a handful of still loftier structures , nowhere can compare with China for the sheer mass of supertowers being planned or under construction .
One management consultancy firm estimates that China will erect up to 50,000 new skyscrapers by 2025 .
Along with smaller structures , McKinsey ­estimates that buildings will account for 25 % of China 's energy consumption by then , up from 17 % today .
More efficient buildings could drastically reduce this demand , though few are likely to go as far the 71 - storey Pearl River Tower , which combines many of the world 's leading energy - saving technologies on a scale never seen before .
The most spectacular feature will be the four wind turbines built into the belly of the structure .
The building has been shaped to drive air through the cavities at maximum velocity so the ­turbines can generate 1 m kilowatt hours of electricity a year .
The building will also produce electricity via the photovoltaic cells of the solar shades cooling its east and west facades .
The biggest contribution to energy efficiency will come from the radiant ceiling technology , which uses piped water to keep the internal space cool .
Energy will also be extracted from the difference in air temperature between the building 's inner and outer walls .
Rather than use fans to recirculate old air , fresh air will be delivered to every floor through natural buoyancy .
According to Skidmore , Owings & Merrill , the US architectural firm behind the design , the energy efficiency devices add about $ 13 m ( £ 8 m ) to the construction costs .
But this could be earned back within five years by reduced electricity bills , lower maintenance costs and extra rent from the space not used for air ­conditioning ducts .
Roger Frechette , the firm 's chief engineer , estimates the tower will reduce energy consumption by 58 % compared with a standard building this size .
Under the initial design for a " zero- emission skyscraper " , it could even have generated surplus energy with micro-turbines that could sell electricity back to the grid at night .
But this proposal was dropped after opposition from the local utility company , which is cautious about allowing rival sources of power generation .
This may change .
Faced by a deteriorating environment , uncertain world energy supplies and pressure to act on climate change , the Chinese government is trying to shift towards a more sustainable model of development .
It is experimenting with ecocities and introducing new green building codes .
Guangzhou is following this trend .
As the workshop of the world , the city has a reputation as a humid , heavily polluted sprawl .
But it is trying to change this by building taller structures as well as improving the infrastructure for service industries .
" We are trying to make our city more energy efficient .
In the past , we expanded too fast .
That was a mistake we are trying to correct now , " said Chen Qing , the deputy director of the city 's Urban Planning and Research Centre .
Not everyone , however , is convinced that skyscrapers are the best way to achieve the city 's green goals , given that the Pearl River Tower will be built with 26,500 tonnes of steel and more than 40,000 cubic metres of concrete , and that its main tenant will be a tobacco company .
Meng Qinglin , a professor at the ­environment and energy laboratory of the South China University of Technology , says urban planners are following global fashions without paying sufficient attention to whether low emission buildings are what they claim to be .
" There is a misconception that buildings can generate sufficient wind and solar power for themselves .
We need to look deeper at how much pollution is caused and how many resources are used in the development and manufacture of those technologies , " he said .
" They call it clean energy , but often the burden is simply being shifted to other places , where the silicon is mined and the turbines and solar panels are made . "

Floridians could vote for the first time next year to allow marijuana for medical use .
A petition drive , started last week by an Orlando woman whose father has Parkinson ’s disease , would make the drug legal for any condition as prescribed by a doctor .
Marijuana is the only drug Cathy Jordan says helps her fight Lou Gehrig ’s disease .
The 59 - year - old mother smokes two joints every night to relieve depression and muscle spasms , and to boost her appetite .
“ It ’s keeping me alive , ” said Jordan in an interview at her home in Parrish .
“ Anti -depressants made me a zombie and other drugs had bad side effects .
The crime is that people like me ca n’t get it legally . ”
Floridians could vote for the first time next year to allow marijuana for medical use .
A petition drive , started last week by an Orlando woman whose father has Parkinson ’s disease , would make the drug legal for any condition as prescribed by a doctor .
The last time such an organized effort to legalize marijuana occurred in Florida was 1997 , just one year after California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana .
But in Florida the petitioners fell hundreds of thousands of signatures short of getting to a state referendum .
This time the movement faces some of the same roadblocks , such as opposition from law enforcement and a lack of support by the majority of the medical community .
But the climate has become more favorable in ways that could shift the balance .
A dozen other states have approved medical marijuana since Florida last tried to get it on the ballot , and four state legislatures are currently considering proposals .
Federal law , while it has prohibited marijuana since 1937 , is also shifting : Last month , Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal government would stop raiding marijuana distributors in states where it is legal .
And Florida ’s proponents , People United For Medical Marijuana , hope they can make the argument that legalizing the drug could create tax revenue and jobs to lift the state economy .
Kim Russell , the founder , suggested $ 200 million a year could be gained in tax revenue .
In every state where medical marijuana has been on the ballot it has been successful , with the exception of South Dakota , where it barely lost with 48 percent of the vote .
The challenge in Florida will be slightly steeper because the state requires a 60 percent majority vote .
Getting the proposal on the ballot remains the biggest concern for proponents .
The state political action group , People United for Medical Marijuana , needs to collect 676,811 signatures from registered voters in 10 months .
Jordan and her husband , Bob , collected signatures back in 1997 on Manatee Avenue and said it was “ nearly impossible ” to get even 25 a day , and that many people were scared to sign their names to a document linking them to marijuana .
Instead of relying on sick people or patient advocates to get the word out , Russell is focusing on college students and social networking Web sites such as Facebook — a tactic that could either help mobilize a statewide army or provide an easy target for opponents .
One of the main arguments against legalizing medical marijuana is that the effort is a veiled move to improve access to the drug for anyone who wants it .
Bill Janes , director of Florida ’s Office of Drug Control , and the Florida Sheriff ’s Association have already come out against it .
“ When we increase the availability of marijuana we increase the availability for young people , ” Janes said .
“ What this petition does n’t address is how the marijuana will be controlled .
Will we just allow random growing of marijuana ? ”
More than 4,800 people , many of them college students , have joined the Facebook page in support of the petition , which the Florida Division of Elections recently approved , and Russell said hundreds of students at campuses around the state have agreed to pass petitions .
The campaign manager is Joshua Giesegh , a 20 - year - old who said he is taking the year off from University of Central Florida to focus on marijuana advocacy .
He is also a proponent of legalizing the drug for recreational use .
“ I used to be one of those people who believed all the lies about marijuana that you learn in D.A.R.E , ” an antidrug program offered in schools , Giesegh said in a phone interview .
“ Then I watched my grandpa die of cancer .
He would n’t eat anything .
I do n’t want anyone else to suffer like that . ”
People United For Medical Marijuana is not affiliated with national or professional fundraising organizations , and Russell said raising money will be the biggest challenge .
She estimates they need up to $ 5 million for advertising and administrative costs , declining to say how much has been raised so far .
In the drive for signatures , state government leaders could potentially pose a threat , as they have generally grown less tolerant of marijuana .
Last year the Legislature voted to strengthen laws against illegal growers .
Janes said the tax revenue estimates by the petitioners were overblown and assumed use of the drug would become widespread .
Florida ’s petition leaves it to the Legislature to decide how to regulate distribution and sale of the drug .
While California ’s bare - bones law has led to what some critics say is overprescription of marijuana , more current laws , such as the one that recently passed in Michigan , have guidelines meant to ensure only the truly ill will be able to get it .
In California , marijuana is sold in private shops called dispensaries .
In other states patients with prescriptions for marijuana are required to carry ID cards , and it is only allowed to be grown by the patient or a designated caregiver .
Medically speaking , studies have shown benefits from marijuana , particularly for glaucoma and tremors .
It has also been shown to increase appetite and alleviate the nausea caused by cancer treatments .
But the major medical associations have stopped short of endorsing it .
The American Medical Association in November reconfirmed its decade - old policy that more research was needed .
But it did assign a task force to take a closer look .
Dr. Jameel Audeh , a Sarasota oncologist , said back in 1985 when he was in training , marijuana was one of the best ways to relieve nausea in cancer patients .
But now there are legal drugs he said work as well , including a legalized pill containing a synthetic version of the ingredient found in marijuana , THC .
The potential health problems caused by marijuana , such as lung damage , outweigh the need for it , Audeh said .
“ For cancer patients , this would only be needed for a very narrow group , if anyone , and I ’m not sure that justifies making it legal because of all the other problems it would cause , ” Audeh said .
A terminally ill cancer patient in Sarasota , who asked not to be identified because he does not want to be targeted by police , believes marijuana has kept him alive two years longer than doctors expected .
He does not grow it himself because of the risk of getting caught .
Instead he relies on gifts from friends or dealers who charge up to $ 100 a week .
Mainly the drug helps with his mood and appetite , he said .
The cancer started in his esophagus and spread to his lungs , stomach and liver .
When smoking marijuana became painful because it made him cough , a friend made a vaporizer from a heat gun and a plastic bag .
“ Cancer is a fight against appetite and keeping weight on , ” he said in an interview at his home .
“ If you can keep the weight on you can stay alive longer . ”
To anyone who thinks it should be illegal , he urges compassion .
He is 61 and has two children .
At just over 5 - foot - 10 , he weighs only 145 pounds .
“ It gives me a quality of life I would n’t have without it . ”
– Article from the Herald Tribune .
During our annual summer break we look forward to flying back to the United States to visit family and friends .
However , this year thoughts of our return are filled with some anxiety about what we may face at the airport in Washington , D.C .
Recently , I was disheartened to hear the recorded interrogation of Steve Bierfeldt by Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) officers at the St. Louis airport .
The TSA officers ' actions were unconstitutional and indefensible .
Under the 4th Amendment to the Constitution all Americans have a right to be secure in their person , house , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures from the government .
Unfortunately , the detention , interrogation , and search of Mr. Bierfeldt 's bag violated his 4th Amendment right .
By the time they detained him it had already been ascertained by TSA officers at the checkpoint that he did not possess anything that was illegal to take on an airplane .
Additionally , he had not broken and was not suspected of breaking any law .
During his detention , a background check run by officers indicated he had no previous criminal record .
Thus , there was no probable cause to hold him .
But , according to the TSA officers , they detained , questioned , and searched his bag because a large amount of cash and bank checks found in a box in his luggage made him “ suspicious . ”
They first accused him of being a drug dealer and then of stealing the money .
They threatened to turn him over to the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Again , all because he possessed something that he had a legal right to possess but that in the eyes of the TSA officers made him look “ suspicious . ”
The most egregious aspect of his detention was the utter lack of respect of the TSA officers for Mr. Bierfeldt 's rights as an American citizen under the Constitution .
They questioned him about his work , his employer , the money , and even why he was in St Louis .
The interrogation was reminiscent of another society in an earlier time and should not have taken place in Twenty - first Century America .
Under the circumstances , and aware of his constitutional rights , Mr. Bierfeldt certainly knew that he did n't have to answer their questions .
In fact , by answering many of their questions with , “ am I legally required to answer that question ? ” he gave them plenty of opportunity to consider whether or not he was legally required to answer their questions .
Instead , they told him : “ It is not a question of the law , ” “ You do n't have to understand the law , just answer the question , ” and “ Are you from this planet ? ”
Their absolute disregard for guaranteeing their captive 's rights was scary .
I understand that the TSA has launched an investigation of the incident .
I do expect that the inquiry will be conducted in the spirit of the agency 's civil rights policy which emphasizes that the TSA has “ no tolerance for harassment in the treatment of the public we serve . ”
When it is determined from listening to the recording that the TSA officers harassed and violated the constitutional rights of Mr. Bierfeldt I expect as an American citizen that they will be relieved of their duties .
Furthermore , Madam Secretary , please ensure that all of your agents are familiar with the Bill of Rights and the protections against abusive government power that they guarantee to every American .
After all , the mission of the TSA is “ to make all modes of transportation safe . ”
We should expect to travel safely on airplanes as well as have our constitutional rights safeguarded in doing so .
Ironically , given Mr. Bierfeldt 's recent experience , when I fly in June it will not be the terrorists I fear but the ones sworn to protect us from them .

Current days of free internet will soon be over , says media mogul
Rupert ­Murdoch expects to start charging for access to News Corporation 's newspaper websites within a year as he strives to fix a ­" malfunctioning " business model .
Encouraged by booming online subscription revenues at the Wall Street Journal , the billionaire media mogul last night said that papers were going through an " epochal " debate over whether to charge .
" That it is possible to charge for content on the web is obvious from the Wall Street Journal 's experience , " he said .
Asked whether he envisaged fees at his British papers such as the Times , the Sunday Times , the Sun and the News of the World , he replied : " We 're absolutely looking at that . "
Taking questions on a conference call with reporters and analysts , he said that moves could begin " within the next 12 months ‚ " adding : " The current days of the internet will soon be over . "
Plunging earnings from newspapers led the way downwards as News Corporation 's quarterly operating profits slumped by 47 % to $ 755 m , although exceptional gains on sale of assets boosted bottom - line pretax profits to $ 1.7bn , in line with last year 's figure .
Dwindling advertising revenue across print and television divisions depressed the News Corp numbers despite box office receipts from Twentieth Century Fox movies such as Slumdog Millionaire and Marley and Me. But Murdoch said he believed signs of hope were appearing .
" I 'm not an economist and we all know economists were created to make weather forecasters look good , " he quipped .
" But it is increasingly clear the worst is over . "
He continued : " There are encouraging signs in some of our businesses that the days of precipitous declines are done , and things are beginning to look healthier . "
News Corp 's newspaper division barely broke even , with quarterly profits collapsing from $ 216 m to $ 7 m year - on - year .
Advertising revenue in Britain fell by 21 % and Murdoch revealed the Sunday Times is struggling : " It 's still in profit , but only just so . "
The tabloids had fared better , aided by price battles at supermarkets which spend heavily on print promotions .
Television profits also shrank dramatically , falling from $ 419 m to $ 4 m due to a loss of Superbowl revenue and weaker advertising at the group 's
Fox channels in the US and its Star network in Asia .
News Corp has cut 3,000 jobs over the last year , although Murdoch said very few affected journalists or " creative " personnel .
Its filmed entertainment division enjoyed an 8 % rise in profits to $ 282 m , while Fox News Channel in the US helped push profits from cable subscription networks up by 30 % to $ 429 m .
But News Corp revealed that its interactive media division , which includes the social networking site MySpace , had turned in a lower contribution .
MySpace 's management was recently replaced as News Corp struggles to build sustainable profitability but Murdoch dismissed competition from its larger rival , Facebook .
" We 're not going for the Facebook model of getting hundreds and hundreds of million of people who do n't bring any advertising with them at all , " he said .
Meanwhile a threat to close the Boston Globe was averted today as its owner , the New York Times Company , struck a deal with the daily 's largest union after a week of talks ; the 137 - year - old publication is the 14th biggest - selling US paper .
With the introduction of Snow Leopard , QuickTime Player will assume more of a utilitarian role , with screen recording features reportedly joining the software 's exiting repertoire of basic audio and video capture capabilities .
People familiar with the latest betas of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard have been reporting over the past several weeks the addition of a ' Screen recording ' option in the File menu of the new Quick Time X Player due to ship with the OS overhaul later this summer .
Similar in many ways to a feature long offered by Ambrosia Software through its Snapz Pro X utility , the option will allow users to capture in motion video their Mac 's screen — essentially video screenshots .
Such a feature will be particularly useful for software developers and educators , as it will simplify the process of creating video tutorials , software demonstrations , and anything else best captured in live motion as opposed to still shots .
When selecting the screen recording option under recent pre-release distributions of Snow Leopard , a recording interface prompts the user to begin a video capture then disappears .
A small footprint controller in the upper - right hand side of the Mac OS X menubar can be used to end the video capture .
While its unclear if the feature is fully functional in build 10A335 released Thursday , it was n't in earlier builds , often creating an empty .mov file , those familiar with the software say .

April 25 , 2009 --
The Sri Lankan government claims to be on the verge of totally defeating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE — also known as the Tamil Tigers ) .
The LTTE has fought for more than 30 years for an independent state for the Tamil people on the northern and eastern parts of the island .
The roots of the conflict lie in a long history of state - sponsored oppression of the Tamils , which eventually led some Tamil youth to take up arms .
When the British granted independence to Sri Lanka in 1948 , power was handed to politicians drawn mainly from the upper classes of the majority Sinhala ethnic group .
These politicians used racism as a tool to divide the working class .
Second - class citizens
Tamil plantation workers were deprived of citizenship rights .
Sinhalese was declared the sole official language of Sri Lanka , making Tamil language speakers second - class citizens .
Knowledge of Sinhalese became necessary for public service jobs , excluding most Tamils .
Discrimination was also applied in education .
* * *
The Tamil people need support ;
Sign the statement against the war on the Tamil people of Sri Lanka
* * *
For many years , Tamils opposed discrimination by peaceful means , including demonstrations , sit-ins and taking part in elections .
But peaceful protests were met by violent repression , carried out by the police and army as well as racist Sinhalese mobs incited to violence by politicians and Buddhist monks .
There was a series of pogroms against Tamils , culminating in the murder of an estimated 3000 people in the government - instigated 1983 “ Black July ” riots .
LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham said : “ The anti-Tamil riots that periodically erupted in the island should not be viewed as spontaneous outbursts of inter-communal violence between the two communities .
All major racial conflagrations that erupted violently against the Tamil people were inspired and masterminded by the Sinhala regimes as a part of a genocidal programme .
“ Violent anti-Tamil riots exploded in the island in 1956 , 1958 , 1961 , 1974 , 1977 , 1979 , 1981 and in July 1983 .
In these racial holocausts thousands of Tamils , including women and children , were massacred in the most gruesome manner , billions of rupees worth of Tamil property was destroyed and hundreds of thousands made refugees .
“ The state ’s armed forces colluded with the Sinhalese hooligans and vandals in their violent rampage of arson , rape and mass murder . ”
National self - determination struggle
This repression boosted Tamil nationalist sentiment .
In 1977 , the Tamil United Liberation Front won 17 seats in the Sri Lankan parliament on a platform of Tamil self - determination .
The repression of peaceful protest led many Tamil youth to violent methods .
The LTTE was formed in 1972 under the leadership of Vellupillai Prabakharan , then a 17 - year - old .
He is remains LTTE leader .
The LTTE carried out its first major armed action in 1978 .
After Black July , support for the LTTE grew among Tamils .
It dramatically stepped up its war against the Sri Lankan Army .
The Sri Lankan Army could not defeat the Tigers , despite brutal repression that included civilian massacres .
In 1987 , India sent a “ peacekeeping force ” to Sri Lanka , with the stated aim of protecting the Tamils from Sri Lankan Army violence .
However , the Indian government did not want an independent Tamil state .
The Indian army began repressing the LTTE .
After the Indian troops withdrew in 1990 , fighting again broke out between the Sri Lankan Army and the Tigers .
In 2002 , a ceasefire was signed between the LTTE and the United National Party ( UNP ) government .
But the government failed to offer Tamils a just solution that could guarantee a lasting peace .
Pro-government paramilitary groups , in collusion with the Sri Lankan Army , continued violent attacks against Tamils .
The UNP government , which claimed to want peace , was replaced in 2004 by a more openly Sinhala - chauvinist government — a coalition led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) .
Violence escalated into full - scale war .
LTTE - controlled areas were bombarded .
Blockades prevented food and other necessities from entering these areas .
For several decades , the LTTE was a very effective fighting force .
It inflicted big defeats on the Sri Lankan Army , often killing hundreds of troops in a single battle .
It controlled large areas in the north and east of the island .
The LTTE developed innovative tactics , such as the use of light aircraft to carry out bombing raids on government targets , including in the capital Colombo .
But over the past two years , the government seems to have captured nearly all former LTTE - controlled areas .
On January 2 , 2009 , the government captured Kilinochchi , which had been the administrative centre for LTTE - controlled areas .
This followed five months of aerial and artillery bombardment of the town .
The Sri Lankan Army ’s gains are partly due to aid from imperialist powers .
Israel has supplied Kfir jets to the Sri Lankan air force , which has used them to bomb Tamil areas .
However , this alone cannot explain the scale of the Sri Lankan Army ’s successes .
It is necessary to also look at the strategy and tactics of the LTTE .
LTTE 's strengths and limitations
The LTTE was formed by young people angry at the oppression of Tamils and disillusioned with failed peaceful methods of struggle .
They were also disillusioned by the sell - outs of Sri Lanka ’s main left parties ( some of whom had abandoned previous support for Tamil rights to join coalition governments with the SLFP ) .
Tamil youth did n’t see any prospect of an alliance with Sinhala workers and peasants against the Sinhalese ruling class .
This led them to focus on the military struggle .
They succeeded in building a formidable fighting force .
The LTTE has fought courageously and persistently against the Sri Lankan and Indian armies in an effort to win national self - determination for the Tamil people .
It has also been willing to seek a peaceful solution when it appeared that the Sri Lankan government might be willing to agree .
The LTTE has strong support from the Tamil people in the north and east of the island .
This is indicated by election results ( 20 members of the pro-LTTE Tamil National Alliance were elected to Sri Lanka 's parliament in 2004 ) and by the big attendance at LTTE - organised rallies during the ceasefire .
Yet the goal of national self - determination has not yet been attained .
A Tamil homeland seems a long way off .
This is not solely due to the military power of the Sri Lankan state or its backing by imperialist powers ( important though that is ) .
It is also due to the political limitations of the LTTE .
A one - sided emphasis on military struggle led to mistakes , including the alienation of potential allies .
The Tigers sometimes disregarded the need to win support among Sinhalese workers , peasants and students in southern Sri Lanka for the right of Tamils to national self - determination .
This also applied to the Tamil - speaking Muslims of eastern Sri Lanka .
The absence of a mass anti-war movement in southern Sri Lanka is a key obstacle to the success of the Tamil self - determination struggle .
For instance , the US anti-war movement played a key role in forcing the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam .
The LTTE has been willing to negotiate with Sinhalese political leaders whenever they showed any signs of wanting to reach a peaceful solution .
But the LTTE has not made a serious effort to get its message directly to the Sinhalese masses , bypassing the politicians whose promises of peace have been deceptive .
The lack of a strong anti-war movement in southern Sri Lanka reflects the weakness and political limitations of the Sri Lankan left .
But some actions by LTTE have also helped to alienate the Sinhalese masses .
The LTTE has sometimes responded to Sri Lankan Army atrocities by carrying out atrocities of its own , including massacres of Sinhalese civilians .
The LTTE has at various times carried out bombing campaigns in Colombo and elsewhere in the south .
These actions helped alienate the Sinhalese workers from the Tamil struggle .
When the targets were military , such attacks could be justified , but this was not always the case .
Errors by the LTTE also helped alienate the Tamil - speaking Muslims .
Some Muslim youth joined the LTTE in its early years .
But the government , with the aid of some Muslim politicians , was able to instigate clashes between Tamils and Muslims .
This led the LTTE to become suspicious of Muslims , to such an extent that it expelled them en masse from the Jaffna region .
The LTTE later made efforts to rebuild relations with the Muslims , but suspicions were not completely overcome .
The LTTE ’s militaristic way of thinking has also led to the repression of dissent among the Tamils themselves .
Support Tamil liberation
These problems should not , however , negate support for the right of Tamils to national self - determination .
In particular , there is the need for the removal of the occupying Sri Lankan Army from Tamil areas .
The main blame for the violence lies with the Sri Lankan government .
The cycle of violence was initiated by the government , and the government ’s denial of the right of Tamils to national self - determination remains the main obstacle to peace .
National self - determination means that the Tamils can freely choose whether to form a separate Tamil state , be part of a united Sri Lanka or have some intermediate form such as a federation .
The LTTE has stated its willingness to consider a federal structure .
“ Unity ” imposed by the Sri Lankan Army through violent repression is not real unity .
Such unity requires ongoing repression of Tamils and prepares conditions for a new war .
Some commentators believe the LTTE will continue as a guerrilla force ( small - scale attacks are continuing in the east , which the government has claimed to fully control for the past two years ) .
Others predict the LTTE ’s imminent collapse .
But even if the government wins a complete military victory , the occupation of Tamil areas by the Sri Lankan Army cannot bring lasting peace .
Occupation will always breed resistance .

Will the world end in fire or in ice ?
That is , are we going to be hit by global warming or are we going to freeze because of lack of fossil fuels ?
We do n't know yet , but it is starting to appear clear that geology is placing a major constraint on anthropogenic CO2 emissions and , therefore , on global warming .
Here , I present a brief summary of some of the recent papers that have appeared on the subject .
Until recently , most simulations of future climate have been run without taking into account " peaking " of the major fossil fuels .
Concepts such as " peak oil " are not discussed , and not even mentioned , in the reports of the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
But , with peak oil coming , or already arrived , the subject is starting to appear in scientific journals , blogs , and conferences .
In a previous post , I reported about the " Mission Earth " seminar held in Zurich in 2009 where climatologists and depletion experts gathered to exchange views .
Here , I present a short review of the status of the field .
There is a very small number of papers published in scientific journals on this subject and I think this summary includes them all .
I also tried to include a number of less formal studies published on the web or presented at conferences .
Some early papers raised the question of the discrepancy of the standard IPCC scenarions and the peak oil projections .
The first one was probably Jean Laherrere with a paper published in 2001 .
Later on Anders Sivertsson , Kjell Aleklett and Colin Campbell wrote in 2003 in " The New Scientist " a paper titled " Not enough oil for climate change " .
They criticized the IPCC scenarios for being overoptimistic in terms of oil and gas reserves .
These early papers did n't attempt to calculate the future concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere .
Perhaps the earliest attempt to quantify the effects of CO2 on climate while taking depletion into account was the work by Pushker Kharecha and Jim Hansen who produced a paper titled " Implications of " peak oil " for atmospheric CO2 and climate " .
This study was published in 2008 but became available on line as a working paper in April 2007 .
In the first version of the paper , Kharecha and Hansen start from the premise that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere should not be allowed to exceed 450 ppm ; later on they arrived to the conclusion that the dangerous limit is more likely to be around 350 ppm .
So , they examine several scenarios that involve policy measures to force the reduction of emissions .
They find that , if no such measures are taken , CO2 concentrations might rise to near 600 ppm by the end of the century , mainly as the result of coal combustion .
Oil and gas would peak before 2030 in most of the scenarios considered and would give only a minor contribution to the total of the emissions .
Shortly after the paper by Kharecha and Hansen , David Rutledge published a post on " The Oil Drum " website with the title " The coal question and climate change " ( June 2007 ) .
Later on , in December 2008 , Rutledge also presented his results as an invited talk at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Society .
Rutledge set up an approach that would be used again by other authors ; that is , he started with an estimate of the available resources , from that he generated a production curve that involves " peaking " and then he calculated CO2 emissions in the atmosphere .
Then , by means of the software package named " MAGICC , " available from NCAR , Rutledge generates climate scenarios in terms of CO2 concentrations and atmospheric temperatures .
The results are that geological constraints on coal production ( what he calls " producer limited " profile ) would limit CO2 concentrations to about 480 ppm even without policy measures to curb emissions .
Under these conditions , temperatures might rise of approximately 1.6 deg .
C. Rutledge concludes that " if we wish to reduce the temperature rise , we must bury the CO2 ( assuming that it will not leak out for 1,000 years ) , or establish preserves for fossil fuels that prevent them from being produced . "
Robert Brecha examined the question in his 2008 paper " Emission scenarios in the face of fossil - fuel peaking " .
His approach is very similar to that of Rutledge .
Brecha calculates a series of scenarios in terms of fossil fuel production - including oil , gas and coal - on the basis of reserve estimates and logistic production curves .
No policy interventions are assumed .
Subsequently , he estimates CO2 concentrations and atmospheric temperatures using the MAGICC software package .
His conclusions are that the world energy production could peak from 2030 to 2050 , depending on assumptions , causing CO2 emissions to peak as well .
The CO2 accumulated in the atmosphere would continue to grow after the energy peak , but it would be slowly absorbed by the effect of the natural " sinks " of the ecosphere .
By the end of the century , CO2 concentrations would stabilize in a range from ca. 480 to 580 ppm and temperatures could rise by 1 - 3 deg C. Brecha 's results indicate - again - that geology , alone , may not be sufficient to stop anthropogenic global warming from reaching dangerous levels .
Luis De Sousa and Euan Mearns ( 2008 ) took an approach similar to the papers by Brecha and Rutledge , but arrived at somewhat different conclusions in terms of policy recommendations .
For estimating emissions , they use a model that they developed earlier and that they term " Olduvai Revisited " ( 2008 ) .
The model is based on resource estimates and forecasts which assume " bell shaped " behavior of the production curves .
They find a global peak for fossil fuel production by 2018 .
Using the MAGICC software package , they find that , for this scenario , CO2 concentrations should not rise over 450 - 500 ppm and that temperatures should not rise over 1 deg .
C. De Sousa and Mearns conclude that fossil fuel decline will keep CO2 concentrations below levels that are or were considered dangerous by climate experts and that there is no need to burden the OECD and non-OECD countries with artificial measures to mitigate emissions to achieve this end .
The latest entry on this subject published in a scientific journal is a paper by Willem Nel and Christopher Cooper which appeared in " Energy Policy " ( 2009 ) with the title " Implications of fossil fuel constraints on economic growth and global warming " .
The paper is very detailed and comprehensive in its estimates of fossil fuel reserves ; it also includes estimates on the contribution of renewables , nuclear and unconventional fuels .
The authors generate production scenarios based on logistic curves .
CO2 concentrations and atmospheric temperatures are calculated by a detailed modeling approach .
In what they call the Energy Reference Case , Nel and Cooper find a peak in the total world primary energy production that should take place around 2025 .
According to the authors ' model , the peak will not slow the growth of the gross world product .
It will keep growing for a couple of decades longer , peaking only around 2050 .
CO2 emissions are expected to peak with primary energy , that is around 2025 .
The calculated maximum CO2 concentrations do n't exceed 500 ppm , except for the most pessimistic scenario , in which 550 ppm are reached .
From these concentrations , Nel and Cooper calculate that the temperature increase prior to 2100 should not exceed 1°C .
They conclude that this increase in temperature is not dangerous and that reaching these CO2 levels is preferable to facing the economic and social consequences of not fully exploiting the remaining fossil fuels .
The study by Nel and Cooper has been challenged by Antonio Zecca and Luca Chiari ( 2009 ) in a working paper to be submitted to a scientific journal .
Zecca and Chiari criticize the conclusions of the paper regarding CO2 concentrations and temperature effects .
First , they argue that CO2 future concentrations are underestimated because the lifetimes of CO2 molecules in the atmosphere may be longer than assumed in the paper .
Furthermore , Nel and Cooper may have underestimated the climate sensitivity due to forcing and other factors in their calculations .
According to Zecca and Chiari , even for the " Energy Reference Case " scenario presented in the paper , the final temperature increase of the atmosphere may be of the order of 1.7 °C .
They also stress that there is no reasonable guarantee that fossil resources that are now too expensive or difficult to extract wo n't be used , as Nel and Cooper assume .
Therefore Zecca and Chiari consider the conclusions by Nel and Cooper to be much too optimistic in terms of the opportunity to continue to burn hydrocarbons .
Finally , let me report on what is perhaps the most recent entry in this field , the work by Dolores Garcia ( 2009 ) which was presented at the " Mission Earth " seminar held in Zurich in 2009 .
Garcia 's model is a modified version of the " World3 " model that was developed for the study " The Limits to Growth " published in 1972 .
It links together several parameters : energy , greenhouse gases , population , GDP and others .
It is a truly integrated model , an approach more advanced than that of the other models described here .
Nevertheless , Garcia 's results are consistent with those of the other papers , with carbon dioxide production peaking around 2020 .
Garcia does n't attempt to calculate temperatures , but the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is calculated using an approximate estimation of the effect of sinks .
It stabilizes at 510 ppm by the end of the century .
The studies published so far that take into account both peak oil and climate change are a truly minuscule number in comparison to the total number of papers that deal with climate change .
This says a lot on how the problem was neglected so far .
Nevertheless , a consensus seems to be emerging .
Even with different models and different assumptions , it appears that geological constraints pose an important limit on CO2 emissions .
All the studies discussed here arrive at the conclusion that , even without policy interventions , the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere will stabilize in a range that goes , approximately , from 450 to 600 ppm .
These values are far below those of the " business as usual " ( bau ) scenario of the IPCC that predicts a CO2 concentration of about 1000 ppm by the end of the century .
Based on these studies , peak oil ( and , in general , peak fossils ) is going to have a strong effect on the climate issue .
For one thing , it may well make the Kyoto treaty obsolete .
There would be no need for policy measures to enforce the Kyoto targets .
The emission limits that today are often seen as an insufferable set of constraints on the economy , could become , in the near future , just a consequence of the reduced supply of fossil fuels coupled with a contracting economy .
On the other hand , the targets of the Kyoto treaty might well turn out to be insufficient to counter global warming .
At this point , there is no consensus among the authors in terms of policy recommendations relating to these results .
Some of the authors cited here conclude that peaking of fossil fuel production will be sufficient to maintain CO2 at a level below that considered dangerous by many climate experts .
But this conclusion is not shared by other authors who maintain , instead , that even if we could be sure that CO2 concentrations would remain in the 450 - 550 ppm range , we would still face dangerous levels of global warming .
Clearly , this is a difficult issue to solve , given the uncertainty in the scenarios and in the calculations of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and the temperature effects .
Furthermore , there are several phenomena that the climate models do n't consider and that could make warming much more serious than currently believed .
Among these , the saturation of the CO2 sinks , the positive feedback of the methane hydrates and those of the ice / albedo system .
We just do n't know enough to be able to say whether depletion is enough to " save " us from global warming .
However , it may not matter which threat one considers the most immediate : there exist measures that will mitigate both global warming and depletion .
These are energy efficiency and replacing fossil fuels with nuclear energy or renewables .
There is only one mitigation measure that does n't cut both ways : CO2 geological sequestration .
If depletion is a more immediate problem than global warming , clearly it would make no sense to waste precious resources in removing CO2 from the atmosphere .
On the other hand , if oil and gas depletion leads us to rely more on coal , then sequestration might be necessary .
In my opinion , the studies I have discussed show that there are serious threats looming ahead .
I believe that whether the threat be depletion or warming , we should move away from fossil fuels as fast as possible .
Still , it is not at all certain that what we can do will be enough and we might well suffer for both effects : lack of fuels and global warming .
It would n't be " fire or ice " , but fire and ice .
I would like to thank Antonio Zecca for his comments and suggestions .

Just getting Ready to go out while on vacation .
As for all the comments on my last submission about us being “ Pro ” we are not .
We have been boyfriend - girlfriend for a year and both just love to take pictures .
My last submission was my “ first time ” to post on VW , not my " first time " to ever take pictures with my man , but ever since I heard of this site I have buggEd my boyfriend about sending some in , I am the biggest exhibitionist you will ever meet / see .
I think our secret is he tells me to seduce him , be his slutty girl , for me show him how bad I want to fuck him ) and then we just work hard and long to get good shots , not that its like real work .
Hope you enjoy these as well .
Oh and by the way as for my job I am a realtor , anyone need a house ?
Just thought I might as well get some mileage out of all this .
Please keep the comments cumming , I cant promise to respond to everyone , but I will enjoy reading everyone , just be nice , life is too short to be negative .
Lets have some fun !!!!

Is it possible that Obama ’s winning quality was his willingness to be a good loser ?
The president ’s main mission , after all , was to try to talk the French and Germans into supporting a serious global stimulus plan , and he failed .
There were other accomplishments , sure .
But even the tiniest seemed to have required a lot of pandering .
When Sarkozy said France would help with the administration ’s plan to shut down the Guantánamo Bay prison by accepting one released prisoner  that would be one as in “ less than two ” 
Obama gushed that it was hard to keep up with “ the great leadership of President Sarkozy , courageous on so many fronts . ”
To be fair , the French , the Germans and the other heel - dragging countries have some reason to be dubious about getting too close to Obama in anything but a photo op .
The Europeans do n’t really trust American presidents to deliver on what they say , particularly if it has to go through Congress .
While the G - 20 was finishing its business , members of Congress were showing how they did theirs by passing a budget resolution .
The spending plan was somewhat smaller than the president had requested .
The Senate also added the Republican priority of reducing taxes on people who inherit estates of $ 7 million or more  a move that would increase the deficit while stimulating the economy approximately as much as eliminating a sales tax on square potato chips .
But even so , not a single Republican voted yes on the budget .
In the House , the G.O.P. came up with an alternative that would cut more taxes for the wealthy while clamping down on nondefense spending .
House Republicans think we invest way too much on these government programs and try to cut back on them every single year that their party is not actually in power .
In the Senate , Republican Judd Gregg of New Hampshire predicted that the budget plan “ will absolutely put this country on an unsustainable path . ”
This would be the same Judd Gregg who agreed to join the Obama cabinet as commerce secretary before a last - minute discovery that the president is a Democrat .
Actually , it ’s no contest when you think about it .
The French are n’t even in the ballpark .
E = 0 ( E = 0 )
E += 20 * 20 / 50 ( ' A ' E = 8 )
E += 20 * 20 / 50 ( ' B ' E = 16 )
E += 10 * 10 / 50 ( ' C ' E = 18 )
E = 1 - ( E / 50 ) ( E = 0.64 )
E " = E^2 ( E " = 0.4096 )
In the previous post I 've written about a tool that measures entropy , but , I left the problem of " why the hell should somebody measure entropy " for later .
That " later " is now :)
As one can figure out from the tags of this post , the knowledge of entropy distribution can be useful while reverse engineering some application .
To be more precise , measuring entropy is done in the reconnaissance phase of analysis , and it allows one to learn about which parts of the application is encrypted / compressed , where are the blank spaces , which parts are not compressed , where are the strings / texts , bitmaps , etc .
Let 's start at the beginning - what exactly is entropy ( in the IT meaning ) ?
Personally , I favor an unofficial definition , that states that , meaning , that the more chaotic / random the data is - the higher their entropy is , and the more monotonous / constant / ordered / non - random the data is - their entropy is lower .
So we 've learned two things : ( 1 ) entropy is the measure of randomness of ( 2 ) some provided data .
In our ( RE ) case , we can says that the ' provided data ' are the succeeding bytes of some file / memory region / network packet / etc .
In case of thetool , one - pixel bar on the chart shows the entropy of 256 succeeding bytes of data ( the file is split to N 256 - bytes regions , and the entropy of each region is calculated and shown as a one - pixel bar on the chart ) .
How to calculate the entropy ?
There are a few methods .
I use a simplified one ( it does n't catch all the correlations ) that works by analyzing the histogram ( array of frequency of occurrence of each value of byte - i.e. one can learn from a histogram that ' A ' occurs 100 times , ' B ' 50 times , etc ) of the data .( at the end we can , it 's not needed , but I do it anyway ) .
Another good idea is to calculate Entropy ^2 , then the entropy differences are more noticeable - I 'll use E " as Entropy ^ 2 from now .
For example , let 's take the following 50 - byte data , and let 's calculate it 's entropy , step by step :
First , the histogram ( what - how many ) : A - 20B - 20C - 10 other - 0 Now the entropy ( E ) : So the final E of this fragment is ( or 64 % ) , and the E " is From this moment I 'll use the E " value only , and I will refer to it just as " entropy " .
But what exactly " 40 % entropy " means ?
Let 's calculate E " for two more fragments of data , so one can discriminate what is what ( just the results this time ) : - E " = 0.00 % - E " = 96.04 %
As one can see , the " constant " stream of A letter has zero entropy , but the stream of letters , where each letter is different and occurs only once , has entropy 96.04 % .
( OK , why 96.04 % and not 100 % ?
It 's because of my simplified formula - the bigger the size of data is , the closer it gets to 100 % .
The maximum value of the entropy in case of my formula will be ( 1 - ( 1 / Size Of Data ) ) , so if one wants the scale from 0 to 100 % , one should additionally multiply E by , but it 's not that important anyway . )
Now we know how to calculate the entropy .
But what does that give us ?
It happens so that different " types " of data have different entropy - so if we have a bundle of different types of data ( like in an executable file ) , one can use entropy chart to learn what data types lay where in the file .
There are a few regularities I was able to observe ( for a 256 byte data piece ) : 1 ) Data / code encrypted with a " non-trivial " cipher ( I 'll talk about what a " non-trivial " cipher is later in this post ) have E " >= 97%2 ) Compressed data / code has E " >= 97%3 ) " Empty " place ( i.e. zeroed ) has E " == 0%4 ) Identical data in a few succeeding data fragments has constant E" 5 ) x86 code has 80 % <= E " <= 95%6 ) Text data has 18 % <= E " <= 90%7 ) Headers have usually a very low E " ( since they consist of many zeros ) , usually on the 50 % level8 ) Random data has very high entropy , E " >= 97%9 ) Cipher keys have usually very high entropy , E " >= 97%10 ) Arrays of constants for algorithms like AES or MD5 have very high entropy ( this depends however on the implementation and used compiler ) , usually E " >= 92 % A little explanation on what the " non-trivial " cipher is ( in this case ) .
I 'll explain it by contrast - a " trivial " cipher in this case is a cipher thatof data / code , meaning that the sorted values of a histogram of initial and encrypted data is identical ( meaning , if the chart that occurred the most times in initial data , occurred 100 times , than the char that occurs in the encrypted data will occur also 100 times , even if it 's a different char ; and the same for the send - most - occurring char and so on ) .
Examples of such " trivial " ciphers are : 1) Adding a one - byte CONSTANT to each byte2 ) Subtracting a one - byte CONSTANT to each byte3 ) XORing a one - byte CONSTANT with each byte4 )
Binary rotation of each byte , left or right , a CONSTANT number of times ( bits ) 5 )
Other switching the places of bits in a byte using a CONSTANT schema6 )
Other reversible operation on each byte , identical to each byte7 ) Compositions of above " Trivial " ciphers do not change the entropy of the data in case of the formula I use , however , every other cipher WILL IN FACT CHANGE the entropy , usually raising it ( except some ultra strange accidents with XORing data with identical - to - data key , resulting in a zero - stream with null entropy ) .
Some examples of ciphers changing entropy :1 ) Adding position of a byte to that exact byte ( data [ i ] += i )2 ) XORing data with a long non-null - entropy key3 ) AES , RC4 , etcIn case of anti-RE , sometimes it 's better to use a " trivial " cipher , since the power of cipher makes no difference anyway ( since the key has to be included ) , but more powerful ciphers give away the position of encrypted data .
Time for a gallery of entropy charts ( made by Ent ) , with my comment for each .
A small remark before I 'll start - if we want to know where in the file a single entropy bar lays , then we just take the position of that bar ( X axis ) and multiply it by 256 - i.e. a bar is at X=83 , so the data in the file are at HEX ( 83*256 ) = 5300h .
The above charts shows the entropy of a compiled by MinGW GCC , not stripped , version of Ent executable .
A few observations :1) No part of the file is encrypted by a non-trivial cipher2 )
There are headers at the very beginning of the file , followed by 256 bytes of zeros , or some other constant bytes ( look at the first 4 bars ) 3 )
In the code section ( marked green on top ) lays , in fact , the code ;>4 )
In the data section ( blue on the top ) many zeros lay , and there are two " fragments " of data , maybe it's text ( 5300h and 5A00 h ) 5 )
In the " gray " area there are some headers ( low entropy in the center of the image ) - headers / information for a debugger ?
6 )
In the " gray " area , from 125 to 152 column , there is a risen entropy area , some more information for the debugger ?
7 )
On the right side of the screen the entropy is high , but it is not code ( what would it be doing there ? ) , so probably it 's some text data ( and in fact it is , these are the names of symbols )
The same file , packed with UPX .
A few observations :1) The code sections is either encrypted or compressed ( in case of RE is barely makes a difference ) 2 )
At the end of the section ( 2 - 3 last bars ) some not - encrypted code exist ( in fact it 's the decompressing loader ) 3 )
As for the rest , same as in the case of not - packed version of the fileVista calc.exe : 1) The headers are noticeably separated from the code section2 )
The code section is not encrypted with a non-trivial cipher3 ) Around 291 pixel ( 12300h ) the entropy is low , is probably IAT , after which ( high entropy again ) the function names occurs ( it 's hard to explain that phenomena in any other way ;>) 4 )
A large portion of data is either encrypted or compressed ( in fact it 's a 256x256x32 PNG image of a calculator ) 5 )
At the end of the file there are some headers and some text6 )
Probably the most of the blue section contains resources ( icons , dialogs , etc ) Some malware packed with PEncrypt 3.1 ( a downloader ) : 1) The first green section is compressed / encrypted2 )
The second green sections is not , and probably it contains a loader3 ) the data section is not encrypted
The app from Hackerchallenge 2008 Phase 3:1 )
Three different parts of code is encrypted , probably separately2 )
The data section is encrypted OR ( judging on a constant entropy of that fragment ) it contains some keys or arrays of constants for some cipher algorithm ( afair AES constats and the key was there ) 3 )
At the end of the file some constant padding is places ( the constant entropy , it 's in fact a repeatable string XPADDINGX , placed by the compiler )
And thats that .
As a final word I 'll says that I 'm using the entropy chart at work for about 2 years now , and it 's really have sped up the analysis of a few things - a quick chart generation , a single look on the chart , and one knows ( with a large probability ) : 1 ) Is the file encrypted ?
2 ) Where are the encrypted parts ?
3 )
Where is the text / strings ?
4 )
How is it distributed ?
It gives one quite a boots at the very beginning of the analysis ;>
Update 8:30 p.m. SPD is releasing new details in the fatal crash this morning involving a bicyclist and a van at 24th Ave. near 65th St. Both the van and the bicyclist were headed southbound on 24th Ave .
“ As the traffic signal turned green for southbound and northbound traffic ( at 65th ) , witnesses stated the van proceeded through the intersection and the bicyclist passed all the stopped southbound vehicles on the left at a high rate of speed then briefly moved back into the bicycle lane , ” police say .
“ South of the intersection the van signaled and moved into the left turn lane in order to turn left onto NW 64th Street .
Witnesses stated the bicyclist attempted to pass the van on the left as it entered the turn lane .
The bicyclist collided with the left rear of the van . ”
Medics tried to revive the 39 - year - old man , but his injuries were too severe .
As you can see from this image from KIRO - TV ’s coverage , the accident occurred right in front of The Viking .
“ He was moving , ” said one witness named “ mBasher ” in comments below ( #150 ) , explaining the bicyclist carried some downhill momentum through the light at 65th St .
“ When the light turned green he was passing cars in the bike lane , and the van pulled away from the curb where the bus stop is .
He swung wide to the left to go around the van .
I think he thought the van was just pulling out into traffic , but when he realized the van was making a U - turn , he laid the bike down and slid under the van . ”
The SPD account of the accident does not mention if the van driver was making a U - turn or not , but police say the driver was interviewed and released pending further investigation .
“ The driver of the van is still very shook up and she feels terrible , ” said My Ballard reader Kass in comments .
Meanwhile , mBasher says an off - duty firefighter and grocery clerk nearby came to the man ’s aid as medics were called to the scene .
The man was rushed to Harborview as medics performed CPR , but unfortunately he had suffered fatal injuries .
Police investigated the scene of the crash throughout the day , keeping 24th Ave. closed for several hours .

Limbaugh 's fuming -- who will Jebby back ?
He said the pressure he feels " more than anything else " is coming to a decision since many Delaware Republicans are waiting for him to make his next move .
Castle is viewed by national GOP strategists as the only Republican who is able to pick up the seat once held by Vice President Joseph Biden .
Erick Erickson sent a message to the members of Not one penny to the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) .
--------------------
Subject :
They are listening
I 've been getting all sorts of emails begging me to shut this group down .
Instead , please consider inviting ten friends each .
The NRSC will not listen to us unless we help shut down their fundraising .
You can help .
Thanks ,

The candidate got a zero from the National Right To Life Committee and a 100 from NARAL Pro-Choice America .
Planned Parenthood rates him a respectable 73 .
The National Taxpayers Union rated him a D and the National Association of Manufacturers rated him a 45 % .
The far right , anti-labor BIPAC rated him at 50 % and the Chamber of Commerce gave him a 75 % .
He rates high with environmental groups -- in the 90s .
The NRA rates him an F ( up from an F - in 2007 ) .
The AFL - CIO rated him at 58 % , the UAW 64 % and SEIU gave him 63 % .
Americans for Democratic Action ( ADA ) rated him 50 % .
The ACLU rates him at 55 % , the NAACP gives him a 73 % and gay rights group HRC gives him a 65 % .
The Christian Coalition gave him a 20 % and the Conservative Union a dismal 28 % .
The John Birch Society has him at 30 % , Club for Growth at 40 % , the Eagle Forum at 29 % , the Family Research Council at 23 % ( up from 18 % in 2007 ) , and both the Traditional Values Coalition and GOPUSA at zero .
The National Organization of Woman ( NOW ) rates him at 75 % and the far - right US Women 's Chamber of Commerce gives him a zero .
The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America ( anti-war ) gave him an A and the Vietnam Veterans of America ( pro-war ) gave him a 12 % .
Does the above profile sound like a high - profile Republican Senate recruitment ?
Not if you 've been listening to Dick Cheney and Rush Limbaugh .
But it 's recent ratings for longtime Delaware Republican Michael Castle and the NRSC and GOP senators are begging him to jump into the race in the very Democratic state .
( McCain only scraped up 37 % last year , while Castle was re-elected with 61 % .
Put another way , McCain drew 152,374 while Castle drew 235,437 , just 20,000 less than Obama ) .
Today Josh Kraushaar and Manu Raju atreport that Castle is seriously mulling over the race .
" I talk to senators , they call me , I talk to them .
There 's no real pressure , " Castle said , mentioning that he ’s recently talked about the race with Sen.
John McCain .
Cornyn , Hatch , McCain may be playing it cool and giving Castle lots of space but they 're absolutely desperate .
If he does run , it is likely to be against Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden , son of the VP and the state 's longtime senator .
Right now he's on military duty in Iraq as a captain in the National Guard .
Polling for Castle is great but he knows it does n't guarantee anything .
The GOP knows if Castlerun , it guarantees that the seat will not be in play .
The Cheney - Limbaugh teabagger wing of the party is up in arms because the NRSC is leaning towards endorsing mainstream conservative Jim Gerlach over Club For Growth Know Nothing Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania , begging corporate hack Carly Fiorina to challenge drooling true believer Chuck DeVore for the GOP nod in California , and has already endorsed Charlie Crist over the darling of far right extremist loons , Marco Rubio , in Florida .
Yesterday we saw how Rep. Kevin McCarthy is trying to recruit mainstream candidates for House races , often at the expense of far right extremists .
Expect an explosion out of Limbaugh soon as he seeks to reassert his authority over his fractious party .
Erick Erickson , a Georgia Republican extremist who hosts a fanatic website , Red State , started the Facebook group , " Not one penny to the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) , " which I promptly joined .
He sent all us members a note today :
Do n't forget -- not one penny .

“ In Kentucky , our prison budget is approaching half a billion dollars , ” said J. Michael Brown , secretary of the State Justice and Public Safety Cabinet .
“ And as dollars get scarce , it forces a tremendous amount of scrutiny . ”
The annual cost to keep someone in prison varies by state , and the type of institution , but the typical cost cited by states is about $ 35,000 , said Peggy Burke of the Center for Effective Public Policy , a nonprofit group that works with local governments on criminal justice matters .
The most pervasive cost - saving trend among corrections departments has been to look closely at parole systems , in which it is no longer cost - effective to monitor released inmates , largely because too many violate their terms , often on technicalities , and end up back in prison .
In California , among the few states to mandate parole for all convicts , parole violators  not new offenders  account for the largest percentage of inmates entering the system .
New Jersey recently began a program for some offenders on parole with technical violations , like failing to report to a parole officer or changing their address without the officer ’s approval .
Rather than being returned to jail , those former inmates are sent to a center for a clinical assessment of their risks and needs .
With that change , the state is on track to save $ 16.2 million this fiscal year .
Other states are shortening paroles , or even sentences , to save money .
In Kentucky , Gov. Steven L. Beshear , a Democrat , is about to sign a bill that makes permanent a pilot program that offers qualifying inmates credit for time served on parole against sentence dates , in part to avoid a pattern of inmates ’ choosing to stay in prison rather than risking later parole violations .
The trial program saved the state $ 12 million last year .
The state has also adopted a program that gives treatment rather than jail time to select drug offenders .
In California , where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , has called for $ 400 million to be cut from the state ’s corrections budget , officials are seeking to remove low - level drug offenders from the parole supervision system and to provide them treatment options instead .
Like other states making such changes , California is led by a governor who long opposed such shifts in prison policies .
But Mr. Schwarzenegger , as well as other leaders and lawmakers who are far more conservative , has come around to a view held by advocates of sentencing and prison reform that longer sentences do little to reduce recidivism among certain nonviolent criminals .
Rove - connected judge recuses self from Minor case Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Wednesday April 1 , 2009

There were startling new developments on Wednesday in a case of alleged political prosecution of a Mississippi attorney .
Once - prominent attorney Paul Minor , jailed on charges of bribery , has alleged that his prosecution was politically motivated and timed to Mississippi 's gubernatorial elections .
He has also alleged that there was direct involvement by former Bush White House Deputy Chief of Staff , Karl Rove .
Surprise recusal from judge The United States 5th Circuit Court of Appeals was scheduled to hear an appeal of the case today .
Scheduled to serve on the three - judge panel were Judges Will Garwood , Priscilla R. Owen , and Catherina Haynes .
This morning , however , only hours before oral arguments were to be presented , Judge Owen recused herself from the case .
In August of last year , Raw Story reported on Judge Owen 's possible conflicts of interest , including connections to former Bush White House Deputy Chief of Staff , Karl Rove :
Rove had a longstanding interest in Owen 's career , beginning in 1994 , when Owen hired him as a campaign consultant in her successful bid for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court , paying him $ 250,000 for his efforts .
Rove helped Owen raise over $ 900,000 for that campaign .
Jim Moore , a long - time Texas journalist who has chronicled Rove 's career in several books , including Bush 's Brain : How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential , explained the unique relationship between Rove and Owen in a Wednesday phone interview .
" He did everything for her .
He created her career .
He handpicked her to go to the Texas Supreme Court when he was trying to take over the Texas Supreme Court , " said Moore .
" He was looking for people to groom and raise money for and have in his pipeline .
Rove went and plucked her out of obscurity .
She was an unknown lawyer in Houston . "
Minor has alleged that Karl Rove was directly involved in his prosecution .
In a letter sent in 2007 to the House Judiciary Committee , Minor wrote :
" I am writing to you because you are the only people who can help me prove that the Bush Justice Department 's prosecution of me and Justice Oliver Diaz , Jr. , and Judges Wes Teel and John Whitfield was politically motivated .
Over the past few months , it has become increasingly clear that Karl Rove , political strategist for Bush and other Republicans , conceived a strategy to dry up political money to Democratic candidates which included using the Justice Department as an instrument to prosecute prominent Democrats , particularly trial lawyers . "
Despite the possible conflicts of interest , Judge Owen did not recuse herself last year , ruling on August 15 against Minor 's motion for bond pending appeal .
Late last week , Minor 's attorneys were notified that Judge Owen would be presiding over today 's appeal hearing .
On Monday , Hiram Eastland -- one of those attorneys -- filed a motion with the court asking that Judge Owen recuse herself from today 's proceedings .
Replacing Judge Owen for the hearing was Judge Fortunato Benavides .
a President Clinton appointee .
Judges are skeptical of government 's argument Minor 's defense team hired a court reporter to document the court proceedings .
A rush transcript has been obtained by Raw Story and is linked here .
Questions from the judges showed skepticism of the government 's case , says attorney and Columbia University Professor Scott Horton .
" It 's always problematic assessing what 's in the mind of a judge based on the questions he asks , " Horton wrote in an email .
" But in this case , it 's clear that Judge Garwood has some real problems with the prosecutions case .
He seems to think the theories are stretched pretty thin and he is obviously troubled by the government 's claims that campaign donations to a judge can simply be counted as bribe payments . "
" If the government applied this rule uniformly , " Horton continued , " hundreds of judges would be prosecuted all across the country .
And the Bush Justice Department applied this ' rule ' only against Democrats , even though their Republican opponents took substantially larger sums of money from agents for litigants before them and were never investigated .
If I were a government prosecutor sitting in the room , I would have walked out with a ill feeling .
But we have to keep in mind that Garwood has a pretty strong trackrecord of upholding convictions , so the questions were a bit surprising . "
In one particularly heated exchange , Judge Garwood corrected the government attorney , Elizabeth Collery , in relation to a Supreme Court ruling :
JUDGE GARWOOD : Does n't it say though in any action , in any case now or which might thereafter be pending ?
MS. COLLERY : That 's right .
The instruction allows the jury to convict if they believe that when Minor gave the bribes he did n't have a specific case in mind , a pending case .
The bribes could be in connection with some future proceeding .
And that 's consistent with how bribery law has always been understood .
JUDGE GARWOOD : Is that not consistent with what the Supreme Court said in the agriculture department case .
MS. COLLERY : That 's a gratuity case .
JUDGE GARWOOD : No .
That 's section 2 one -- what is it ?
210 ?
MS. COLLERY : 201 .
JUDGE GARWOOD : Which covers both gratuity and bribery and is exactly the same language in the gratuity and in the bribery statutes part of that statute .
As far as what is designed to be influenced .
It says an action .
The words exactly the same and the Supreme Court said an action .
Means a particular action , not just any action that might arise .
Former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver E. Diaz Jr. , who was also tried twice -- and acquitted twice -- as part of the same government case against Minor and Judges Wes Teel and John Whitfield , was pleased with today 's hearing .
" The judges were not buying the government 's argument , " he said .
" Things could not have gone better for Paul [ Minor ] . "

Ok , Obama is n't Pinochet .
Thank God .
And we do n't have people being disappeared .
But torture seems to be a hard chapter to close .
That concerns me .
Labor and manufacturing have been all but destroyed .
Those at the top of businesses and non-profits are gouging while the rest of us are underpaid , overworked , and living in terror of job loss day after day .
It is time to end bankster welfare and get on with the work we hired Obama ET AL to do .
Provide fairness and stability for Americans again .
Ok , it 's only been so many days .
But the noise does n't sound like progressive noise .
When I heard Obama refer to the economy as a diseased patient , my Naomi Klein lights started flashing wildly .
Obama speaks Friedman and that makes my skin crawl .
Who can get into his ear and tell him we want him to go in the direction of the Third Way , social democracy , not disaster capitalism .
And , yes , I am so concerned I feel a similar grieving like I felt when my family all passed away within one year .
Very heavy hearted .
Anyone have some good news ?
Is Obama becoming less enamored of genius boy Summers ? and the Bankster CEOs ?
We are n't becoming like the Bushies here are we ?
I mean it is ok to question , right ?
or should I say left ?
We are open - minded progressives , right ?
left ? center ?
Thousands of DNA samples from innocent people are currently retained
The inventor of the genetic technology behind the national DNA database says it risks losing support because it holds the records of innocent people .
Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys told the BBC's World at One programme that the database 's expansion left some people unfairly branded as criminals .
His work led to the creation of the DNA database , which holds records of almost all those arrested - convicted or not .
The Home Office says it is reforming the database after a European ruling .
The DNA profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in England , Wales and Northern Ireland are kept on the database , regardless of whether they are charged or convicted .
At present there are about 4.5 m profiles on the database .
But in 2008 the European Court of Human Rights heavily criticised the database for storing the profiles of innocent people .
The retention constituted a disproportionate interference with the applicants ' right to respect for private life and could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society
European Court of Human Rights
DNA database ' breach of rights '
The judgement said that holding these records " could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society " .
The Home Office has yet to announce how it will comply with the ruling but is talking to opposition parties in an attempt to build a consensus .
But Sir Alec , who developed his techniques at the University of Leicester , told the BBC Radio Four 's World at One programme that the database had gone beyond its original and justifiable remit .
" My concern is that the way the database is now being populated by increasingly innocent people - and getting hard numbers on this is difficult .
" I 've seen figures as high as 800,000 entirely innocent people on that database .
My concerns , which were very much reflected in a recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights , is that this is a real violation of an individual 's privacy . "
Sir Alec said he agreed with the court 's assessment that this level of retention was " blanket and indiscriminate " .
" There 's a real risk of stigmatisation , particularly ethnic minorities are being over - represented , along with juveniles , " he said .
Unconfirmed reports have suggested the Home Office will try to comply with the ruling by retaining the DNA samples while deleting the profiles of people who were not convicted .
The court 's ruling said however that the problem lay with holding both the DNA and the profile of people who had not been convicted .
" The obvious question is what they would do with those DNA or cellular samples that they are going to retain in the future ? " said Sir Alec .
" You have to weight the rights of a potentially small number of criminal investigations that would be solved by retaining this very large number of innocent profiles , against the real distress it causes to these innocent people .
" I 've met some of them - many are unhappy .
They see themselves branded as criminals in the future " .
A spokesman for the Home Office said the government would comply fully with the judgement at the earliest opportunity .
" We are currently in ongoing discussions with opposition parties on the most appropriate way forward and we will publish these shortly , " said the spokesman .
" In addition , the contents of the regulations will be subject to a full public consultation , the findings will then be put before parliament for debate and approval . "

This week 's New Yorker cover , drawn on an iPhone using the " Brushes " app , got artist Jorge Colombo a cool new gig :
He 'll be making a new drawing each week for the New Yorker Web site .
But it 's also been a money - maker for " Brushes " creator Steve Sprang .
He tells the New York Times that the buzz around the New Yorker cover has boosted sales up to 40 x .
On Monday alone -- his highest day of sales -- he sold 2,700 copies of the app at $ 4.99 , which made him $ 9,400 after Apple 's 30 % cut .
Sales have n't fallen off a cliff .
" Brushes , " on sale for $ 3.99 , is still no .
28 in Apple 's list of the bestselling paid apps .
So Sprang has easily made five figures this week without doing anything special .
Here 's the video of Colombo drawing the New Yorker cover .
Program Manager Syndrome , that is .
A few days ago I called for Microsoft to slash not 5,000 jobs but 50,000 to make the company lean and focused once more .
Readers responded by asking which 50,000 Microsoft heads I ’d like to see cut off ?
Wow , what a great question !
So great , in fact , that it inspired this column and probably the one after .
Because it ’s not that simple to just fire half a company .
It ’s remarkably easy , in fact , to fire the WRONG half .
Restructuring Microsoft has to have a point beyond simply improving profitability , which was pretty darned good to start with .
It requires first identifying the systemic problems inside the company that ought to be addressed by thoughtful , if brutal , change .
But people do n’t gchange .
That kid you knew in high school who was a weasel - rat , well he ’s probably a fat and balding weasel - rat today .
People are sometimes changed by life - or career - threatening experiences , but generally not even then , which is why organizations that try to change hardly ever succeed .
So you have to cut deep – very deep – to make change stick .
One approach to show management is serious about change is to attack the big identity aspects of the concern like its name , where it is based , and who is running the show .
Remember Boeing moved its corporate headquarters to Chicago in an attempt to show the world it was a different company .
ValuJet merged with a smaller company and changed its name to AirTran .
If Microsoft is going to successfully change it will have to make similar moves , at least for some divisions .
Current top management , of course , should go .
Microsoft has several systemic problems holding it back .
Like many big , proud , older , successful - if - fading - somewhat companies , Microsoft ’s problems are seen by some as the reasons for the company ’s past success , which they may well be .
It ’s just that Microsoft has outgrown those old ways of doing things ( or the market has ) only they have n’t figured that out yet .
Ignoring completely the company ’s anti-trust issues , Microsoft ’s primary failing is technical arrogance .
Some of this is native and some is a vestige of Redmond ’s long association with IBM .
Taking the IBM connection first , let ’s look at something current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in my 1996 PBS documentary , Triumph of the Nerds :
“ In IBM there ’s a religion in software that says you have to count KLOCs ( pronounced KAY - lock ) , and a KLOC is a thousand lines of code .
How big a project is it ?
Oh , it ’s sort of a 10 KLOC project .
This is a 20 KLOCer .
And this is 5O KLOCs .
And IBM wanted to sort of make it the religion about how we got paid .
How much money we made off OS / 2 , how much they did .
How many KLOCs did you do ?
And we kept trying to convince them – hey , if we have – a developer ’s got a good idea and he can get something done in 4 KLOCs instead of 20 K - LOCs , should we make less money ?
Because he ’s made something smaller and faster , less KLOCs .
KLOCs , KLOCs , that ’s the methodology .
Ugh ! ”
While Microsoft learned a lot from IBM , this whole KLOC - orientation and associated ass - backward reward scheme repulsed them because it led to bloated code .
So just like a child who grows to ultimately emulate or rebel against parental examples , Microsoft shunned the KLOC and embraced the power of tight code .
And though it might surprise you from looking at their current product lines , they still do .
The way a company that prides itself on tight code can build something as floppy ( in every sense ) as Windows Vista is because Vista is simply too big for any one Microsoft executive or engineer to understand in detail .
So they embrace the idea that piling lots of chunks of tight code somehow wo n’t turn into a huge steaming mass of not -very - tight product .
But it does .
But wait , there ’s more !
Somehow this mistaking fat for muscle became institutionalized at Microsoft through a unique group of people called Program Managers or PMs .
This is a Microsoft invention intended to make their products more useful and elegant , yet in practice the PMs do just the opposite .
Program Managers at Microsoft are the advocates for software usability .
They link ( or are supposed to link ) to the rest of the company development , usability and testing .
They write specs and try to optimize the user experience , though with only limited success .
The bloated development , test , and PM teams across the company are a sign of Microsoft ’s obsession with technology and all things technical .
There are n’t nearly enough usability engineers , designers , writers , editors , and other people who worry about how usable the software actually is .
In other words , like the people who run the feature teams at Apple .
A Microsoft designer once said that the biggest difference between Apple and Microsoft was that at Apple designers usually owned the product features , while at Microsoft , PMs always own the features .
And most of the PMs at Microsoft are highly technical , often with computer science degrees .
This is considered a good thing , by the way , but it is n’t good at all .
It means the PMs tend to lean in favor of the developers just as management leans in favor of the developers , too .
So in most cases where usability goes head - to - head with development , usability loses .
And so do users .
The answer for Microsoft is not to blindly copy Apple because Microsoft will never BE Apple and will never have a Steve Jobs as boss .
The answer is to adopt a similar product design philosophy to Apple ’s with the focus squarely on usability .
This will not happen EVER with the present culture at Microsoft .
The first head of usability at Microsoft was a woman named Mary Dieli whom I met at Apple in the early 1980s when she was an intern there .
Mary , who went on to get her PhD at Carnegie Mellon , ran usability for Adobe Systems and then was lured to Microsoft around the time of Windows 3.0 .
We used to talk , she and I , about her frustration at Microsoft and how difficult it was to be the champion of something that was considered non-technical , even effete , like usability .
Mary could never break into the boys club that runs Microsoft .
It ’s not just that she was a woman , though , it ’s that her field got only lip service , not respect .
At Microsoft the PMs and development managers have the power to control product features , not the usability researchers and designers , who are overworked and without real authority .
Microsoft needs to somehow shift its corporate culture away from an obsessive focus on technology and engineering toward creating software that ’s much more user - friendly .
Until it does this , the company will continue to be slammed for its products .
Next time we ’ll consider exactly what sort of tough love will be required to make Microsoft in the 21st century the kind of success it was in the 20th .

Statistics :
The online marketing game is changing as we speak .
The recent Google Panda 4.0 update saw 100s of websites crash and burn .
The penalties have resulted in countless small businesses losing their income .
It has also resulted in tons of paranoia .
However , even in these times , the fundamentals of online marketing remain EXACTLY the same ( that is , if you know what you are doing ) .
I will give you hard PROOF that it is still very much possible to have a thriving online business – in fact , I have done that hundreds of times for my clients .
I want to help you …
Dramatically Expand Your Online Reach By Using A
Method Which 99 % of Marketing Companies Do NOT Even Know About – GUARANTEED !
.. But that is not all .
I also have another GUARANTEE in place :
My marketing method will help you outrank authority websites which have over 50,000 links with just 8 - 12 backlinks , dramatically expanding your online reach , irrespective of your niche !
Yes , you read the last sentence right .
If you want to improve your business ’s net income by up to 5 - 10 times , read this page very carefully .
Spending 15 - 20 minutes reading this page might make the difference between losing a lot of money online trying shady / hyped up marketing tactics or having a successful money - making business which stands the test of time .
Hi ,
My name is Yasir Khan and I am the owner of Quantum SEO , a Canadian - based online marketing company which has generated over $ 1.80 million in the last 4 years .
I understand that marketing is an ever - changing industry but I have spent countless hours testing out nearly every marketing tactic under the sun .
So what exactly is it that makes ME different ?
Well , to keep things simple :
– I have serviced over 1000 clients from over 15 countries in the last 4 years and I am known fairly well in the marketing industry .
– Most of my clients ’ websites rankings have remained stable even after the disastrous Google updates in 2013 and 2014 .
– My unique marketing method is THE most effective method available – GUARANTEED .
– You can talk to me on the phone and I can answer your questions directly .
This is something most marketing companies never do .
– Finally I can provide you ACTUAL proof of my clients ’
ROI before you sign up , so you can make an educated decision .
That being said , I know EXACTLY why you are here ..
If you are actively searching online for different marketing services , chances are that you either own an online business , are thinking of starting one or are employed by a company which is planning to increase its exposure online .
Either way , you think you have a lucrative idea which is worth a decent amount of money online but you just cannot seem to get enough visitors to your website / brand in order to see the sales rolling in .
Sounds familiar ?
The truth is : Nearly every webmaster faces this situation .
The problem is that you are not using the right online marketing techniques to maximize your revenues .
The irony of starting a business online is that designing a website or an e-commerce store is by far the easiest part .
Marketing your website effectively to ensure sales is usually a nightmare .
It is an area where 95 % of all webmasters continually fail and lose hope .
However , the other “ sophisticated ” 5 % make an absolute killing .
Think about it , if all it took to make money online was to churn up a fancy looking website , we all would be millionaires .
Unfortunately , most online marketing courses sell that dream and essentially lie to their customers .
No matter what anyone says , you will never make a sustainable amount of sales unless you promote your brand the right way .
Many of my clients have lost over USD 12,000 per month on pay - per- click marketing and “ hyped - up ” marketing services because they were taken in by flashy sales letters talking about the “ amazing new method ” or that “ one SEO secret which will make you millions online ” .
On this website , however , you can be confident that there is no hype involved .
However , I digress .
The point is , even with the difficulties you faced in marketing your website and after the latest crazy Google Panda 4.0 update , you can still make it big online , if you hire the right marketing company .
In the online world , you need to be good at reverse - engineering Google ’s algorithm in order to rank at the top of search engines in order to get attract free traffic .
Sure , you can also try pay - per - click ads but my experience tells me that it is virtually impossible to make a good profit by using PPC since each click eats up your margin .
I have spent an average of 5 - 6 hours each day ( including weekends ) for the last 24 months reading up and implementing hundreds of marketing techniques and only 2 - 3 of those have turned out to be effective .
There is a reason why established marketing professionals charge upwards of USD 1000 an hour .
It is because not a lot of people have the time or energy to understand the complicated art which is online marketing .
It is also because 95 % of the other “ marketing experts ” have no idea how to get traffic through Google even though they might have a headline saying “ Guaranteed top positions or your money back ” .
So what EXACTLY am I proposing ?
My unique method will get your website ranked in Google , Yahoo and Bing – PERIOD .
My method entails procuring only a HANDFUL of homepage backlinks from AUTHORITY websites , all PR 3 - 7 .
These are websites which have :
– Wikipedia , DMOZ , Yahoo !
Dir , CNN and / or BBC links pointing to them
– A lot of MajesticSEO Trust Flow & Citation Flow
– WhoIS information turned off ( to maintain privacy )
– Over 3 years of domain age .
Some of them are 13 years old !
Oh , and before I forget , I have spent anywhere between $ 350 - 2800 to acquire EACH domain because I know how effective this method is .
What this means is that 5 - 12 links from these types of domains WILL most likely get you ranked at the top for many keyword phrases .
Infact many of my clients are delighted at being ranked number 1 within 2 - 3 months ABOVE websites like :
– Forbes
– Wikipedia
– CNN and BBC entries
– Huffington Post
Try getting other marketing companies to get you ranked above such authority sites from the get - go , and they will probably bow out quickly .
My method usually translates into permanent ranking increases such as the one shown below , for a new reputation management website which is ranking above Forbes.com within 2 months :
Some important points to note :
Because my unique method has stood the test of time ( it has been working really well since the last 3 years ) and since I have spent tons to acquire these “ assets ” which make you rank very well , the service is n’t exactly cheap .
However , most of my clients can recover their investment within months of getting ranked .
Once again , this is a premium service and might not be suitable for everyone but that is EXACTLY what makes it effective !
Want PROOF of rankings and results before you order ?
If so , send me an email to qslsupport@gmail.com requesting ranking reports and I will show you EXACTLY how I can increase your business !
Do you have questions before signing up ?
I talk to 2 - 3 new clients everyday and answering their questions takes around 20 minutes of my time .
I would be happy to do the same for you .

When San Diego lost its station , Jon Elliott ( who was on Air America for the last 3 years ) began working to found a new station .
His plan was to make a station with a strong signal that could be heard all over San Diego and to make sure that liberals controlled it so that a conservative company like Clear Channel could n't pull the plug on it if it was helping liberals win elections .
It took Jon Elliott about 18 months to put all of the plans in place , but he 's done it .
And it 's not just a station for San Diego .
The first station will be here in San Diego on 1700 AM but the goal is to have 30 stations by 2014 .
We 're setting the station up in a way that will be easy to franchise in other cities , particularly ones that had successful AAR stations and lost them ( a growing list , sadly ) .
Our radio line - up will be all of the favorites who are no longer on Air America ( or in some cases never were ) -- Stephanie Miller , Thom Hartmann , Randi Rhodes , Jon Elliott , etc .
We 'll also have local shows in each city .
The catch is that with the craptastic economy , we can't get ourselves off the ground on advertising alone .
We 're going with a hybrid model , in which we 're asking people to become members .
The real benefit you get is that the radio station exists - but additionally you get podcasts and invites to member - only events .
The Air America affiliate in Los Angeles , KTLK , is probably the worst - run radio station I 've ever heard .
It could n't be worse if the program director wasto make it suck -- and I often think he is doing just that .
The rise of Air America was one of the key factors in the Democratic landslide in 2006 .
Here in L.A. , Clear Channel immediately destroyed the station .
It 's barely listenable now and often not listenable at all .
They have right - wing hosts ; they have hours and hours of paid programming from hucksters and crooks selling bogus cures , intestinal cleanses and hemorrhoid medicines ; sports takes precedence on most nights .
Other than Thom Hartmann 's show there is nothing that can be counted on to be worth switching away from KCRW , the NPR station .
I hear it 's like this across the country , even if few stations are as terrible as the one in L.A. A year -- almost to the day -- after the 2006 elections , Clear Channel pulled the plug on their San Diego station , replacing it with a redundant 4th sports channel ( which has been a predictably gigantic failure ) .
Nationally they have a great blog and they have Rachel Maddow in the morning .
After that it gets kind of sketchy , starting with lame , right - wing talker Montel Williams .
But even that is n't available in San Diego .
Our friend Jill Richardson reports on an exciting , game - changing new development down there .
The station started broadcasting in San Diego today at 3 pm .
Membership is $ 10 / month and you can join here at www.jontalk.com .
The plan is to expand as they increase their financial capacity .

One Russian blogger has paid a visit to the modern Russian nuclear plant .
Normally it is forbidden to take photos there , but they have made an exception for him .
So now we have a rare chance to see what ’s inside of the Russian most modern power plant .
This power plant is situated near Smolensk city .
Its power generation potential is 3 Megawatt and it was build for 8 years , from 1982 to 1990 .
There were planned to be four nuclear reactors , but because of the panic after the Chernobyl accident the forth block has not been completed , so there are three of them for now .
Let ’s go inside .
In Russia there are now 10 active power plants .
This one produces 1/7 of the overral electricity outcome of Russian nuclear powerplants , so it is a big one .
Because this powerplant was completed after the Chernobyl , they paid a special attention to secure it from alike accidents .
There is even a saying that “ The sci - fi writers are on the second place by richness of imagination , the first place is occupied by the nuclear plant security engineers ” , meaning that they need to make it safe just for some unimaginable events that not very likely to happen , but still the security system should be ready for them .
The outside structure that secures reactors themselves can stand the blast that exceeds ten times the power of atomic bomb blast , just imagine .
There is a 30 km ( 18 miles ) security zone around the plant itself .
It ’s literary filled with all sorts of sensors and monitoring devices that measure the condition of the environment and should report any smallest deviation from normal radiation doses .
There is also a water pound , the normal thing on such an object , that stores strategic reserve of water , which is said to be very clean and is fishing there is the big dream for every local – it does n’t freezes in winter and has plenty of different fish species .
The entrance to the station has a few protection levels , including palm scan , checking weight ( it should n’t ) differ from the number on profile .
Everyone should be dressed into uniform .
Everyone gets personal radiation checker .
The turbines .
The main reactor hall , the reactor itself is in the concrete reactor cavity
The nuclear fuel used is Uranium255

Following the departure of founders Randy Saaf and Octavio Herrera , the future for MediaDefender looked even more uncertain than it did previously .
However , those concerned that their favorite anti-piracy spoofing company might drift away , fear no more .
MediaDefender 's parent company just acquired everyone 's favorite anti-piracy tracking company , MediaSentry .
ARTISTdirect , the company that owns infamous anti-piracy spoofing company MediaDefender has just announced that it has acquired SafeNet ’s anti-piracy tracking company , MediaSentry .
Following the departure of its two founders , MediaDefender CEO Dimitri Villard said MediaSentry had been bought for $ 936,000 , comprised of $ 136,000 in cash and an $ 800,000 1 year note .
“ The combination of MediaDefender , the leader in Internet Piracy Prevention ( IPP ) with MediaSentry , the leader in business and marketing intelligence derived from P2P channels , creates a true powerhouse in the field of intellectual property protection , ” Villard said .
“ This acquisition will enable MediaDefender to dramatically expand its effectiveness by providing customers with a wide range of options to meet the constantly evolving challenges in copyright protection and enforcement . ”
Among file - sharers , MediaDefender grew to become one of the most hated anti-p2 p companies but always maintained that it did not track individuals or report them to the authorities or copyright holders .
With its acquisition of MediaSentry , a company designed to do just that , MediaDefender now boasts the full range of tools to hinder , mislead , track , monitor and report copyright infringers .
Previously a SafeNet Inc. subsidary , MediaSentry became well known as the RIAA ’s main anti-piracy partner , providing crucial support to the lobby group during its aggressive litigation campaign against file - sharers .
The RIAA dumped MediaSentry in January , choosing to work with Danish tracking company DtecNet instead .
MediaSentry is best known for harvesting IP - addresses of alleged copyright infringers but their methodology has been questioned in court by several experts .
On top of that , Mediasentry ’s investigation tactics were deemed illegal in several states because it operated without the appropriate and required paperwork .
According to some , this was why they were ditched by the RIAA .

My Chronicle of Higher Education article was picked up by Arts & Letters Daily and from there picked up by fark.com .
Now , I was aware that the quality of comments at Fark could be very low ; but I did n't realize it could be THAT low .
I 've never seen anything like it , despite occasional ill - advised visits to places on the web where the ragged people go .
As conversations go , it 's like walking past a dog pound .
The policy at Fark seems to be bark first , look at the article maybe later .
Responding to such stuff is probably a waste of time .
( One must never forget the reason why it is a bad idea to wrestle with a pig : you both get filthy , but the pig enjoys it . )
So just very briefly , let me supply these short answers :
To the guy who asked " why is a Scot writing invectives about an American style guide ?
That 's like having a French writer comment on a style guide from French Canada " : I 've been an American citizen longer than you 've been alive , and I have 25 years ' experience of teaching about language at the University of California .
To the various people who assert that I am a disappointed style - guide author plugging a rival text ( " the article 's author has his own competing book to flog " ) :
I have n't written anything that could plausibly be recommended to a freshman taking English composition .
When people ask me for recommendations , I tell them to look at the very sensible and intelligent book Style : Toward Clarity and Grace by Joseph Williams .
by Joseph Williams .
To the guy who said " my penis could type a better article " : your girlfriend told me she does n't think so .
Finally , a couple of people just could n't stomach the following admittedly rather complex sentence of mine :
William Strunk was a professor of English at Cornell about a hundred years ago , and E.B .
White , later the much - admired author of Charlotte 's Web , took English with him in 1919 , purchasing as a required text the first edition , which Strunk had published privately .
I did overestimate the reading age of Fark commenters .
And naturally they assume that my piece is an exemplar of style , not a set of claims about why Americans are confused about grammar .
So to train me in Strunkian style , we 're going to make me say that again using only simple active clauses with no needless words :
Strunk was a professor .
Cornell employed Strunk .
Strunk taught English .
A century has passed .
Strunk published Elements .
Strunk paid the bill .
The edition number was 1 . Cornell admitted E. B. White .
White took English .
The year was 1919 .
White bought Elements .
Many years passed .
White wrote Charlotte 's Web. People admired White .
I hope that clears up the matter of what I meant with all my relative clauses and stuff .
Never again will I exceed a sentence length of 5 words when ( or rather if ) writing for Fark readers .
But for now , I 'm switching Fark off .

Airport to charge passengers £ 1 to ' kiss and drop ' at terminal
Luton Airport will charge £ 1 for dropping passengers off at the terminal .
Motorists will have to pay the charge to spend up to 10 minutes in a refurbished drop - off zone .
The levy , which will come into force some time after April 29 , will be enforced at barriers at the exit of the zone .
Luton Airport
Luton , like many other airports , already charges £ 1 for the use of luggage trolleys and the same amount for clear plastic bags to take liquids through security .
Travellers can also pay £ 3 to use a ' priority lane ' to get through security more quickly .
An Airport spokeswoman said drivers who did not wish to use the drop - off zone could leave passengers at the mid-term car park where there is a free shuttle buss to the terminal two minutes drive away .
Airport operator Abertis also runs Cardiff and Belfast airports , sparking fears similar fees could spread to other hubs .
Nic Horton , Luton 's general manager of projects and development , said : ' Dropping passengers off can be a stressful experience , we have therefore given careful consideration to providing the right facilities and enough time for people to unload in a secure environment .
' Making a small charge reminds drivers of the 10 - minute time allocation and keeps the traffic flowing .
' By offering a choice of options we can provide an airport experience to suit the needs of all our passengers . '
The new zone will have more space for people to unload ans well as larger bays for passengers with reduced mobility .
Birmingham Airport charges £ 1 for 15 minutes for its ' drop and go ' car park next to the terminals , or £ 2 for 30 minutes .
KING GEORGE ISLAND , Antarctica —
More than 30 years before the moratorium on mining in Antarctica is set to expire , countries are quietly positioning themselves for a potential land grab .
* Geobiologist Jeff Marlow traveled to Antarctica during the past two weeks as part of an international expedition exploring conservation and environmental issues , sponsored by BP .
In a series of reports for Wired.com , he shares his experience seeing the area first - hand with a number of Antarctic climate , conservation and biology experts .
The journey brought a number of issues to the fore , including trash accumulation , ecosystems knocked out of balance by warming temperatures , and simmering political tensions over the region .
* Marlow is from Denver and is currently earning a Ph.D. at Imperial College London , working on the European Space Agency 's ExoMars rover .
The 1961 Antarctic Treaty stipulates that the continent should be owned by none and open to all for scientific purposes and other peaceful pursuits .
The Protocol on Environmental Protection — added to the books in 1991 — banned all mineral exploitation for 50 years .
" The treaty stopped a lot of land claims from being made , " said Derek Pieper , a member of our recent scientific expedition to Antarctica .
Pieper researches environmental management at Oxford University .
" Countries are n’t as aggressive about claiming stuff as they used to be . ”
No economically significant mineral deposits have yet been found on Antarctica , largely because more than 97 percent of it is covered with ice .
But more than 500 million years ago , it was part of a supercontinent known as Gondwana that also included modern - day South America , Australia and Africa which are rich in copper , diamonds , gold and coal , so Antarctica has potential .
Forty - seven nations have signed on to the Antarctic Treaty , and it is often regarded as one of the more effective works of international law .
But subtle maneuverings for territory and economic stakes predate any cooperative framework .
The United Kingdom claimed a slice of the continent in 1908 , and New Zealand , France , Australia , Norway , Chile and Argentina followed suit in the ‘ 20s , ‘30s , and ‘ 40s .
Chile and Argentina remain most vociferous about their overlapping claims .
In both countries , it is illegal to display a map not showing the nation ’s claimed Antarctic territory .
Approaching King George Island is like driving into the fluorescent anomaly that is Las Vegas :
The island is overdeveloped and overrun with human activity in an environment that has no business supporting human enterprise .
The 500 - square - mile piece of black rock is home to stations from Argentina , Brazil , Chile , China , South Korea , Poland , Russia , Uruguay , the Netherlands , Ecuador , Germany , Peru and the United States .
Of course , this sprawl is on a much tamer , Antarctic scale , and no one is going to confuse the island with Sin City .
But the trends of settlement do raise important issues that concern the very future of Antarctica .
Today , it ’s easy to get the feeling that the bases on King George Island remain slightly superficial .
The island is the most accessible part of greater Antarctica , remaining ice - free for most of the year .
This geographical factor affords nations the opportunity to construct permanent stations and thereby become full members of the Antarctic Treaty , a privilege that involves them in the decision - making process .
A cynic could justifiably see opportunistic nations positioning themselves for a potential land grab if the mining moratorium were to expire in 2041 .
Despite the " scientific " purposes of the stations , for example , it took the Chilean Frei station 26 years to employ a full - time scientist , and Russia ’s Bellingshausen station , with a capacity of 50 people , has just one scientist .
Meanwhile , several of the stations have gone out of their way to promote civic life , hoping to further legitimize their territorial claims by exerting their cultures on King George Island settlements .
The Polish Henryk Arctowski station used to welcome female visitors with flowers grown in an on - site greenhouse , before bureaucratic obstacles got in the way .
China ’s Chang Cheng Station was inaugurated with a " dove of peace " ritual in which hundreds of Chinese pigeons were released , nearly all of which froze to death within hours .
Perhaps the boldest move in civil society development came in 2004 , when a prefabricated Russian Orthodox church was shipped in pieces from Siberia to Bellingshausen station on King George Island .
Today , the onion - domed church overlooks Maxwell Bay , standing in stark contrast to the tuna - can abodes of other inhabitants .
There is certainly an impressive amount of great science being done in Antarctica , but many of the bases on the island are more settlements than research stations .
And through the quiet development of civil life on the island , battle lines for the future are already being drawn .

The Knesset on Wednesday morning approved in a preliminary reading a bill introducing one year in prison for anyone speaking against Israel 's existence as a Jewish and democratic state , should the call contain a reasonable possibility " that it may lead to acts of hatred , scorn or lack of loyalty to the State or its government authorities or law systems which have been established legally . "
Forty - seven Knesset members voted in favor of the motion , 34 voted against it , and one MK abstained .
The bill was initiated by MK Zevulun Orlev ( Habayit Hayehudi ) , chairman of the Knesset 's Education Committee .
Opinion A contemptible move Boaz Okon Should the Nakba bill be passed , Israel ’s democracy would lose its soul A contemptible move
Azmi Bishara affair teaches us that statements can quickly turn into actions . "
Following the vote , a harsh argument erupted between MKs Jamal Zahalka ( Balad ) and Arie Eldad ( National Union ) , leading to Zahalka 's removal from the auditorium .
A heated discussion erupted at the Knesset before the vote .
Meretz Chairman Chaim
Oron slammed the government , saying , " Have you lost your confidence in the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state ?
This crazy government – what exactly are you doing ?
Thought Police ?
Have you lost it ?
" Israel 's citizens have the right to say that they believe Jewish and democratic is an incorrect wording .
I think they are wrong , but what does this have to do with the criminals area ?
Enough with this story . "
MK
Orlev replied , " You used very shallow demagogy . "
' You want to punish people for thinking ? '
MK Zahalka said before the vote , " Many intellectuals in the academia who talk about a country belonging to all its citizens belong in prison , according to MK Orlev .
Arab and Jewish leaders who seek real democracy in Israel also belong in jail , according to Orlev …
He wants to put anyone who does n’t agree with him in jail .
" This is the proposal : Whoever says ' death to the Arabs ' should not be put in prison , but whoever says ' a country of all its citizens ' should not be put in prison .
This is a crazy law aimed at managing the political discourse according to laws . "
Knesset Member Ronnie Bar - On ( Kadima ) said that his movement opposed the bill in principle for the simple reason that " a democratic Jewish state is performed , not talked about .
We want to do this , and you with your remarks are thwarting the matter once and again .
Turning to Orlev , Bar - On asked , " What is there in your proposal that it not covered in Basic Law : The Knesset or in the Penal Law ?
You want to punish people for speaking ?
Soon you 'll want to punish people for thinking . "
MK Ahmad Tibi ( United Arab List - Ta'al ) said in response to the bill , " We will not recognize a Jewish and Zionist Israel despite the draconian law , even if we pay a personal price .
This coalition will soon propose a low banning ' expressing shock over the occupation ' and calling for a penalty of five years in prison for anyone expressing such shock . "

AS SOON as they heard that Captain Richard Phillips had been rescued by the American navy — snipers had killed three pirates holding him at gunpoint on a lifeboat — the 19 - strong crew of the Maersk Alabama whooped for joy .
The cargo ship 's horn hooted , flags were flown and flares fired to celebrate the release on April 11th of the skipper who had given himself up to win the release of his crew .
Two days earlier , French commandos had also been in action .
They freed four of their compatriots , including a three - year - old boy , held hostage aboard a yacht , the Tanit ( pictured above ) .
One captive , Florent Lemaçon , was killed .
The United Nations ' envoy to Somalia , Ahmedou Ould - Abdallah , said such stern military measures “ are sending a strong message to the pirates and , more importantly , to their backers ” .
But for the moment the strong message has been met with strong defiance .
Some pirates said they would kill French or American sailors that fall into their hands .
There is little sign , so far , that attacks have been deterred .
Since Captain Phillips 's release , at least four more ships have been attacked — two of them were captured in the Gulf of Aden , the area most closely patrolled .
Some 15 - 20 ships , ranging from bulk carriers to fishing vessels , along with about 300 sailors , are currently being held by Somali pirates .
So far they have attacked ships for gain rather than out of ideology .
They have almost always treated their hostages well while negotiating ransoms .
But Vice - Admiral William Gortney , who commands American naval forces in the region , concedes that things could turn nastier as foreign navies resort to greater force .
“ This could escalate violence in this part of the world .
No question about it , ” he says .
The combination of one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes ( 20,000 ships a year pass through the Gulf of Aden ) alongside the world 's most utterly failed state makes the waters off Somalia the most prone to piracy .
Ransoms of up to $ 3 m make it an attractive profession .
Money earned can go towards buying faster boats and fancier navigation equipment .
Some captured vessels are used as “ mother ships ” , floating pirate bases from which speedboats can be launched against merchant vessels sailing hundreds of miles offshore .
One was captured by the French navy on April 15th .
The International Maritime Bureau , a private - sector outfit , counted 111 pirate attacks off Somalia in 2008 , nearly triple the previous year 's number .
That figure includes the capture of 42 vessels , among them the Sirius Star , a Saudi supertanker , and the MV Faina , a Ukrainian ship carrying tanks .
So far this year , pirates have been more active but less successful .
In 68 attacks they have captured only 18 ships , often small ones .
This is partly due to the presence of more foreign warships , including some dispatched by the European Union , NATO , an American - led coalition and by countries such as China and India wanting to protect their own vessels .
However , their effect may be merely to shift the problem from the Gulf of Aden to the Indian Ocean .
President Barack Obama says America is “ resolved to halt the rise of piracy ” .
But how ?
Piracy off the Horn of Africa is of a different order from other maritime troubles , for example along the coast of west Africa where America is also busy ( see article ) .
Somali pirates operate up to 800 miles out to sea , loiter for weeks and even attack at night .
There are now 20 - odd warships patrolling 1.1 m square miles ( 2.8 m square km ) of ocean off Somalia , two - thirds the area of the EU .
“ There is a lot of water out there .
Twenty assets do not make much of an impact , ” says Commodore Tim Lowe , the British deputy commander of the American - led naval coalition .
By one assessment , it would take about 140 warships fully to secure the Gulf of Aden , and several times that number to protect the seas off eastern Somalia .
So merchant ships are encouraged to look after themselves .
Those making the 500 - mile passage through the Gulf of Aden are told to stick to a designated “ transit route ” and to bunch up for protection in the most dangerous areas and times of day .
In this way vessels , particularly slow ones with decks that are low off the water , can be “ monitored ” ( but not escorted ) by warships .
Such measures have made it harder but not impossible for pirates to capture ships , particularly as some of them prefer to go it alone to save time ( and money ) .
Some suggest protected convoys , but this would slow down shipping and require more warships than are available .
Others propose arming merchant seamen , but that could provoke a spiral of bloodshed .
For now , passive self - defence is generally the norm : barbed wire , fire hoses to try to push pirates away and , above all , an alert crew to spot attacks as early as possible to let the ship take evasive action .
One Western naval officer says placing all warships under a single command , say of the UN , and adopting the same rules of engagement would make the most of the existing forces .
Hillary Clinton , America 's secretary of state , suggests trying to freeze pirates ' assets .
In the end , as she acknowledges , the solution is not at sea but on land .
Somalia needs a viable government to control its territory and shores .
But that is a long way off .
Western countries , after their experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan , are in no hurry to send soldiers to Somalia .
For now , merchant shipping 's best friend may be the weather .
The south - west monsoon begins at the end of May and blows until August or so , making life much harder for pirates .
Let it blow soon .
Five " uncontacted " tribes are at imminent risk of extinction as oil companies , colonists and loggers invade their territiories .
The semi-nomadic groups , who live deep in the forests of Peru , Brazil and Paraguay , are vulnerable to common western diseases such as flu and measles but also risk being killed by armed gangs , according to a report by Survival International , which identifies the five groups as the most threatened on Earth .
Sixty members of the Awá tribe are said to be fleeing from gangs of loggers and ranchers on their land near Maranhão , Brazil .
" Logging roads have been bulldozed through a part of their territory , where the uncontacted groups are living .
The ranchers want land to graze cattle for beef .
The loggers regularly block roads to prevent government teams from entering the area to investigate , " says David Hill , a Survival researcher and co-author of the report .
Little is known about the group of 50 Indians who live along the River Pardo in the western Brazilian Amazon , although there is plenty of evidence for their existence , including communal houses , arrows , baskets , hammocks , and footprints along river banks .
" Loggers operating out of Colniza have forced them to be constantly on the run , unable to cultivate crops and relying solely on hunting , gathering and fishing .
It is believed that the women have stopped giving birth , " says the report .
Perenco , an Anglo - French oil company working in a proposed Indian reserve in northern Peru , is endangering several uncontacted tribes , says the report .
" The company plans to send hundreds of workers into the region .
In recent weeks , indigenous protesters have blockaded the Napo river in order to prevent Perenco boats from passing .
In response , a naval gunboat was called in to break the blockade . "
One group is believed to be a sub-group of the Waorani , and another is known as the Pananujuri .
Perenco denies the tribes exist .
Other tribes in trouble include several living near the Envira river in the Peruvian Amazon .
" They are being forced to flee across the border into nearby Brazil .
Despite being provided with evidence of their existence , Peru 's government has failed to accept that uncontacted Indians are fleeing from Peru to Brazil .
Peru 's president , Alan Garcia , has suggested the tribes do not exist , " says the report .
Ranchers are bulldozing land where a fifth group lives – the Ayoreo - Totobiegosode in the Chaco forest of western Paraguay .
This week a Paraguayan court ruled that a company had the right to log on their land , further endangering their existence .
There are believed to be more than 100 uncontacted groups in the world .
They are concentrated in Latin America , and aerial photographs of one uncontacted tribe in Brazil 's Acre state captured headlines a year ago .
But as many as 40 could live in West Papua , where vast areas of forest and mountain have been barely explored .
" They remain in isolation because they choose to , and because encounters with the outside world have brought them only violence , disease and murder .
They are among the most vulnerable peoples on Earth , and could be wiped out within the next 20 years unless their land rights are recognised and upheld , " said Stephen Corry , director of Survival .
Sumit Nain and Moshe Vardi , Branching Time vs. Linear Time : Semantical Perspective , invited ATVA '07 paper .
... this paper puts forward an , admittedly provocative , thesis , which is that process - equivalence theory allowed itself to wander in the â€œwildernessâ€ for lack of accepted guiding principles .
The obvious deï¬nition of contextual equivalence was not scrupulously adhered to , and the underspeciï¬city of the formalisms proposed led to too many interpretations of equivalence .
In revisiting the notion of process equivalence , which is a fairly central part of concurrency theory , Nain and Vardi end up arguing in favor of a purely trace - based notion of equivalence and the use of linear - time logics .
This in turn leads to a rejection of bisimulation as a tool for establishing process equivalences :
The gist of our argument is that branching - time - based notions of process equivalence are not reasonable notions of process equivalence , as they distinguish between processes that are not contextually distinguishable .
In contrast , the linear - time view does yield an appropriate notion of contextual equivalence .
...
In spite of its mathematical elegance and ubiquity in logic , bisimulation is not a reasonable notion of process equivalence , as it makes distinctions that cannot be observed .
They take pains to point out that they are not claiming that bisimulation or CTL should be abandoned or are not useful .
Rather their emphasis is on the fact that bisimulation is not a contextual equivalence and is therefore not appropriate for establishing equivalence between ( for example ) a specification and its implementation .
As they say in the conclusion of the paper :
The painting was removed from display at the Royal Hibernian Academy
It could be described as oil on canvas featuring taoiseach , but the appearance of nude paintings of Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen in two Dublin galleries has seen the police called in .
A painting of Mr Cowen holding his underpants appeared in the Royal Hibernian Academy and one of him pictured on the toilet ended up in the National Gallery .
Whether it was political subversion or artistic expression if the painter behind them comes to light they could find themselves answering questions from Irish police .
The National Gallery said they had called in the police and were reluctant to comment further on the matter , other than to say the painting had been up for no more than 20 minutes before it was removed .
" It was not authorised to be on display and garda are investigating , " the gallery said .
The academy is also deciding whether or not to call in the police to investigate its mysterious appearance , but a spokeswoman did not want to go further .
" We do n't want to make more of it than it is , " she said .
The painting of Mr Cowen is still on the premises , but in one of the offices instead of on public view .
One woman who saw the painting reportedly offered to buy it .
Apology Irish police are in possession of the other work , and have said that an investigation into the matter is under way .
State broadcaster RTE said it would be making an on air apology after showing pictures of the portraits in its output .
A spokeswoman for the corporation said that upon reflection this was " in bad taste " .

From the Matt Reichel Campaign :
We have exciting news to share !
Former senator Mike Gravel of Alaska has endorses Matt Reichel for Congress !
This high - profile endorsement from a political figure on the national stage is a major boost to our already dizzying campaign .
Here is Mr. Gravel in his own words :
“ I am happy to offer my endorsement of Matt Reichel in the special congressional election in Illinois ’s fifth congressional district .
Matt is the best choice for the fifth district , and he needs your help to get elected .
Matt is more than just a typical politician .
He is a clear break from tradition for the congressional district that has elected Rod Blagojevich and Rahm Emanuel .
He values peace and democracy above all else , as seen from his anti-war activism and his endorsement of the National Initiative for Democracy .
The National Initiative is an important proposal that would establish ballot initiatives on the federal level in the United States .
It would be an important step forward for transparent government and truly empowering the people , and I trust that this is something that Matt will work for once he is in Congress .
Matt has demonstrated that he is a capable politician with his victory in the Green Party primary on March 3rd .
Now he needs your help .
The general election is on April 7th , only a few weeks away .
Please visit www.MattReichel.us to volunteer or donate , or send contributions to The Committee to Elect Matt Reichel to Congress , 1726 W. Carmen , Chicago , IL 60640 . ”
This enthusiastic endorsement from a respected statesman is a great benefit to this campaign .
However , we still need quite a bit of help –both financially as well as volunteers to help get the word out .
If you can help in either way , please do n’t hesitate to get in touch with us .
Thank you for your ongoing support !
Sincerely ,
Ben Head
Director of Communications
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Three weeks ago , several hundred residents of Bonita Springs , Fla. , received letters containing a word that no homeowner wants to see : foreclosure .
But the property in danger did n't belong to them .
Florida developer Ronto Group informed the residents that Palmira Golf Club - the gated community 's crown jewel - was shuttering due to the company 's inability to pay its lenders .
" We were blindsided , " said Ron Saul , a Palmira member and local realtor .
Residents watched as the club 's employees walk out with boxes .
Gone were the club 's services , membership fees worth tens of thousands of dollars , and , in the eyes of some residents , the value of their multi-million dollar homes .
" You have to think about how you might feel if you just watched $ 95,000 ( the cost of a golf membership at Palmira ) go into a black financial hole , " wrote one resident , who asked to remain anonymous , in an e-mail to Fortune .
" This may be the land of titanium drivers and $ 20,000 barbecue grills , but there 's a limit . "
Palmira 's downfall came as a surprise to its members , but it was preceded by similar incidents around the country .
According to Jeff Woolson , the head of commercial real estate company CB Richard Ellis 's golf division , foreclosures of golf clubs and their surrounding communities are on the rise .
" We started hearing from lenders about six months ago , " he said .
" The next thing you know , there 's a master community with a fence around it . "
Buying time
Commercial real estate , a sector that 's lagged behind the rest of the industry in experiencing the credit crunch , is about to get hit hard , according to a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey .
One finding : investors believe that sales of homes in golf club communities will be near abysmal next year which , in turn , will hurt club memberships .
" The courses are owned by people who leveraged them up , and they 're going to feel the pain , " said Susan Smith , the director of real estate at PwC .
Woolson predicts that the number of golf community foreclosures will continue to rise next year - and developers too will feel the pain .
" I 've made a lot of money over the past eight years selling golf courses that were n't making money , " he said .
" The developers see profits when they sell the last 25 % of the development - if the market comes to a halt before then , they 're in trouble . "
One of Woolson 's properties , Winchester Country Club in Auburn , Calif. , was repossessed by Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) in May .
Other prominent golf properties are also battling credit issues : the owners of Park City , Utah 's ritzy Promontory golf community filed for bankruptcy earlier this year , and the Tamarack Resort near McCall , Idaho owes $ 273 million to Credit Suisse ( CS ) and faces possible foreclosure .
Another debtor to Credit Suisse is Quail West , a golf club community that 's just down the road from Palmira .
While owner Ginn Resorts owes $ 675 million to the Swiss bank , Ryan Julison , a Ginn spokesperson , says the developer hopes to keep its club open .
" The homes themselves are not in danger , " he said .
Maybe so , but living in a foreclosed development is n't good for property values .
The houses in Winchester , says Woolson , are worth $ 1 million to $ 5 million each , and as much as 25 % of their worth comes from being adjacent to the green .
Saul insists , however , that Palmira 's residents are worried less about their property values - which are already taking hits in the slowing market - and more about " restoring our world , " he said .
" The golfers are used to golfing every day , the neighbors are used to using the social center - and it just stopped . "
Rather than wait for the lender to act , 400 of Palmira 's members gathered for a meeting after they received the foreclosure letter .
They created an equity club , Palmira Golf and Country Club Inc. , to raise money to keep the club running .
Members were asked to contribute upwards of $ 500 .
Woolson says that equity clubs are risky because they depend so heavily on ongoing participation .
But the equity club 's leadership committee , which did not return phone calls seeking comment , announced this week that neighbors had unified around the issue , collectively producing enough cash to reopen the course by Nov. 3 .
The organization is still waiting to see if the lender accepts their offer to purchase the club .
For now , they 've bought another few rounds for the community , which has invested enough to keep Palmira running through the end of Florida 's golf season in the spring .
After that , the club could belong to them - or the tin can will have to go around again .

THE Chinese word for politics ( zhengzhi ) includes a character that looks like three drops of water next to a platform or dyke .
Politics and water control , the Chinese character implies , are intimately linked .
Such a way of thinking contrasts with the usual view around the world , which argues that since humans cannot live without water , it should be a basic human right , available to all , preferably for nothing .
The Chinese character points to a more useful approach .
In many places water is becoming scarcer .
Treating it as a right makes the scarcity worse .
Some of the world 's great rivers no longer reach the sea .
In many cities water is rationed .
Droughts and floods are becoming more extreme .
These problems demand policies .
Ideally , efficient water use would be encouraged by charging for it , but attempts to do so have mostly proved politically impossible .
A more practicable alternative is a system of tradable water - usage rights .
What used to be seen as separate , local difficulties — in California , the desiccated Aral Sea , the Sahel — now look more like manifestations of a global problem .
As our article explains , many water problems have global causes : population growth , climate change , urbanisation and , especially , changing diets .
It takes 2,000 litres ( 530 American gallons ) of water to grow a kilo ( 2.2lb ) of vegetables but 15,000 litres to produce a kilo of beef — and people are eating more meat .
The problems also have global implications .
Without a new green revolution , farmers will need 60 % more water to feed the 2 billion extra people who will be born between now and 2025 .
Yet there is , globally , no shortage of water .
Unlike other natural resources ( such as oil ) , water can not be used up .
It is recycled endlessly , as rain , snow or evaporation .
On average , people are extracting for their own uses less than a tenth of what falls as rain and snow each year .
The central problem is that so much water is wasted , mainly by farmers .
Agriculture uses three - quarters of the world 's water ( urban use is trivial : most people drink two or three litres a day , on average , but 2,000 - 5,000 litres are used to make the food they eat ) .
Because water is usually free , thirsty crops like alfalfa are grown in arid California .
Wheat in India and Brazil uses twice as much water as wheat in America and China .
Dry countries like Pakistan export textiles though a 1kg bolt of cloth requires 11,000 litres of water .
Any economist knows what to do : price water to reflect its value .
But decades of trying to do that for agriculture have run into powerful resistance from farmers .
They reject scarcity pricing for the reason that water falls from the skies .
No government owns it , so no government should charge for it .
Cap and trade
There is a way out .
Australian farmers have the right to use a certain amount of water free .
They can sell that right ( called a “ usufructuary right ” ) to others .
But if they want more water themselves , they must buy it from a neighbour .
The result of this trading is a market that has done what markets do : allocate resources to more productive use .
Australia has endured its worst drought in modern history in the past ten years .
Water supplies in some farming areas have fallen by half .
Yet farmers have responded to the new market signals by switching to less thirsty crops and kept the value of farm output stable .
Water productivity has doubled .
Australia 's system overcomes the usual objections because it confirms farmers ' rights to water and lets them have much of it for nothing .
Tradable - usage rights have another advantage : they can be used in rough and ready form in huge countries such as China and India that do not have meters to measure usage , or strong legal systems to enforce usage rights .
Instead of sophisticated infrastructure , they depend on local trust and knowledge : farmers sell a share of their time at the village pump .
A system like that works in parts of Pakistan 's Punjab .
Usage rights have flaws .
At first , they confirm existing patterns of use that are often inefficient .
Farmers can cheat , as Australians have found .
They are , at most , a good start .
But they would be better than what exists now , which is sporadic rationing and the threat of a giant crisis .
Or what may come next , a mandatory mass conversion to vegetarianism .
Why does our brain perceive tilt - shift photography as tiny little toy models ?
I 'd love to know the science behind this popular effect .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Multi-million - dollar superyachts sailing from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean for the European summer could be the next high - profile target of Somali pirates , security experts say .
The luxury craft , many measuring more than 100 meters ( 330 feet ) and owned by some of the world ’s wealthiest people , tend to spend the northern hemisphere winter in the Indian Ocean or the Caribbean before relocating to the Mediterranean to host their owners and friends .
Those moving from tropical islands such as the Seychelles , Mauritius and the Maldives need to sail through the Gulf of Aden to get to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal , taking them through the Somali coast ’s pirated waters .
As the weather off the Horn of Africa has turned calmer in recent weeks , attacks have risen dramatically , with all vessels , from small merchant ships to supertankers , vulnerable .
Motoryachts owned or chartered by the mega - rich could be next .
“ The pirates have really increased their capability , they ’ve got better , faster boats with longer ranges , and they ’re able to operate at night up to 300 miles off the coast , ” Crispian Cuss , a security specialist with Olive Group , told Reuters .
“ If a superyacht comes through their area of operation , then they are just as likely to go for it as anything else .
They would be delighted to have that .
It would be rich pickings . ”
Scott Lidbetter , the head of Veritas International , which provides specialist maritime security advice , has seen a surge in demand in recent months as piracy has spiked .

As well as training skippers and crew on how to respond to attacks , Veritas provides escorts for superyachts and luxury ships and advises on the use of technology such as high - pressure hoses and LRADs -- long range acoustic devices -- that have in some cases been successful in fighting off pirate assaults .
While the speed of most superyachts -- broadly defined as anything over 40 meters in length , of which there are about 1,000 in the world -- gives them the edge over 20 - knot pirate skiffs , range and surprise can still work in the pirates ’ favor .
GOOD INTELLIGENCE
“ The pirates now are getting more prepared to go further east ( of 60 degrees longitude ) , which brings vessels moving from the Seychelles , Mauritius and the Maldives into target , ” Lidbetter told Reuters .
“ They are getting very good intelligence on vessels that are either coming through the Suez Canal or the Strait of Hormuz , and there ’s a degree of targeting going on . ”
Pirates have attacked superyachts in the past -- French vessel Le Ponant was seized in early April as it was sailing without passengers from the Seychelles to the Mediterranean -- but there are no reports so far of any megayachts , such as those owned by Russia ’s billionaires , having been threatened or approached by attackers .

Richard
Thiel , the editor and publisher of Power and Motoryacht Magazine , said the piracy threat for superyachts had always been greatest in the South China Sea , but conditions off Somalia made it a severe danger spot .
“ It ’s definitely possible , ” Thiel replied when asked if an attack on a superyacht is likely .
The threat is not only prompting mini cruise ships to sail faster and wider of the Somali coast , but it has also prompted some superyacht owners to take armed guards on board .
Carrying arms on non-military vessels puts ship owners in complicated legal water , but some see it as necessary in order to protect themselves .
“ If there is a change of behavior at all in recent weeks , it ’s the increased desire to have weapons on board , ” Lidbetter said , emphasizing that only trained security specialists were ever likely to be carrying them .
The pieces are coming together for the first test flight ofNASA ?s new rocket , Ares I , scheduled to lift off this summer .
The rocket prototype , called Ares I - X , is scheduled to blastoff from NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , Fla .
The flight will beunmanned , and will only include a partial first stage of the rocket , whichshould lift the vehicle and mockups of its upper stage to about 25 miles ( 40.2 km ) in roughly two minutes .
The test is a critical first try of the new Ares I rocketfor the OrionCrew Exploration Vehicle , which NASA hopes will replace the space shuttle asAmerica 's preeminentspaceship .
Ares I is designed to carry astronauts in the capsule - shapedOrion vehicle that will sit atop the rocket .
NASA aims to send crews aboardOrion to the International Space Station by 2015 , to the moon around 2020 andultimately beyond .
Ares I is being built as part of NASA 's ProjectConstellation , which will also include a larger sister rocket , Ares V , designed to carry heavy cargo instead of people .
" This launch will tell us what we got right and what wegot wrong in the design and analysis phase , " said Jonathan Cruz , deputyproject manager for Ares I - X Crew Module / Launch Abort System .
" We have alot of confidence , but we need those two minutes of flight data before NASA cancontinue to the next phase of rocket development . "
Launch debut looms
Slated for late July or early August , the upcoming Ares I - X demonstrationlaunch will test whether the bottom section of the rocket , called the firststage , burns as planned , as well as whether it can separate from a dummy upperstage and fall back to Earth safely withparachutes .
Engineers on the ground will monitor the flight closelythrough sensors attached all over the rocket to see if the overall vehicledesign is safe and stable .
The sensors measure aerodynamic pressure and temperature atthe top of the rocket to study how it slices through the atmosphere , determining the flow of air over the entire vehicle .
The four cylindrical segments making up Ares I - X's first stage arrived atKennedy Space Center March 19 from the Alliant Techsystems facility in Utahwhere they were fueled .
" The team ? s been working many years to get to thispoint , " said Jon Cowart , Kennedy ?s deputy mission manager for Ares I - X .
" When you get the last of the hardware here , it really energizes the folksand they begin to think this thing really could happen .
It becomes that muchmore real . "
Some assembly required
Since arriving at the Cape , the Ares I -X segments are beingstacked inside the giant Vehicle Assembly Building .
The dummy upper stages , which are packed with weights to simulate the real thing , will be bolted ontothe top .
When complete , the rocket will stand higher than 320 feet .
The launcher is planned to lift off from Kennedy 's LaunchPad 39B , which has also been used to launch both space shuttles and the SaturnV rockets that carried Apollo capsules .
On March 25 , the Mobile Launcher Platform - 1 , which is usedto assemble vehicles and transport them to their launch pads , was handed overfrom the shuttle program to Constellation .
The 4,625 - ton , two - story steel structureis now being repurposed for the Ares I - Xlaunch .
" It truly is a historic day to be turning over a majorpiece of hardware from one manned spaceflight program to another , " ShuttleLaunch Director Mike Leinbach said .
" It really does n ?t happen veryoften . "
The launcher platform has previously been used for bothshuttle and Apollo flights , including the launch of Apollo 11 , which first tookhumans to the moon .
It is planned to retire after this summer 's test flight , having served three different space programs .
Editor 's Note : The U.S. Air Force has responded to concerns raised in this article .
The Global Positioning System faces the possibility of failures and blackouts , a federal watchdog agency has warned the U.S. Congress .
Mismanagement by and underinvestment by the U.S. Air Force places the GPS at risk of failure in 2010 and beyond .
The problem : Delays in launching replacement satellites , among other things .
According to the Government Accountability Office report , " In recent years , the Air Force has struggled to successfully build GPS satellites within cost and schedule goals " as part of a $ 2 billion modernization program .
" If the Air Force does not meet its schedule goals for development of GPS IIIA satellites , there will be an increased likelihood that in 2010 , as old satellites begin to fail , the overall GPS constellation will fall below the number of satellites required to provide the level of GPS service that the U.S. government commits to . "
Considered by the GAO to be " essential to national security " the GPS is also widely used by business and consumers and is a driver for next - generation location - based mobile applications used with smartphones and other devices .
" Such a gap in capability could have wide - ranging impacts on all GPS users , " the GAO report states , " though there are measures the Air Force and others can take to plan for and minimize these impacts . "
It is hard to imagine the U.S. government could allow this to happen .
Actually , that 's a lie , it 's easy to imagine , but there is also time for corrective action to be taken .
The first replacement satellite is expected to be launched this November , some three years after the original launch date .
Speeding up future launches can solve the problem , but is likely to come at a high price .
The American GPS , though the pioneering consumer satnav system , is not alone .
Russia , China , and India each have systems of their own , which are being expanded .
The European Union 's Galileo system , intended as a rival for GPS , is expected to begin its rollout later this year .
The delay and potential failure of GPS gives these other nations the potential to rival the U.S. in space , something the U.S. government is unlikely to accept .
The report is a black eye for the Air Force , which developed the GPS system during the 1980s and has maintained it since .
At last count , David Coursey owned more than a dozen GPS devices and expects his government to keep them working .

Obama ' must act now ' on climate
McCarthy said Obama had a window of opportunity to draw up green policies
The planet will be in " huge trouble " unless Barack Obama makes strides in tackling climate change , says a leading scientist .
Prof James McCarthy spoke on the eve of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) , which he heads .
The US president has just four years to save the planet , said Prof McCarthy .
If major policy changes do not happen within Mr Obama 's term of office , they will not happen at all , he warned .
" We have a moment right now of extraordinary opportunity , with a new president , positioned with scientific leadership that has known no equal in recent times , " the AAAS president told BBC News .
" The calibre of scientific advice that is close to this man is truly exceptional .
" If in his first term , in the next four years , we do n't make significant progress in these areas , then I think the planet is in huge trouble .
" Without US leadership , which has been sorely lacking , we will not get to where we need to be . "
Moment of opportunity Climate change is high on the agenda of this year 's AAAS meeting in Chicago .
Former US Vice President Al Gore is among the speakers at the event , with 10,000 scientists expected to attend across the five days of the meeting .

On the eve of the conference , Prof McCarthy told BBC
News there was now a moment of opportunity to draw up policies that would be effective in combating climate change .
He said : " Many scientists have wondered whether President Obama will be able to make commitments to investments in energy technology and understanding climate change - that were an important part of his campaign .
" I know many of my colleagues looking at the fiscal situation , have felt that these good ideas might be put on the back burner .
" That would be a terrible thing if that happened .
" This is our window , with the science advice he has , with the realisation that these issues are pressing , if they are made second order I think we have really lost it . "

e Bay blames its shrinking revenues on the melting economy .
But sales continue to expand over at Amazon.com , eBay 's conspicuous rival in the e-commerce game .
During the first three months of the year , Amazon sales reached $ 4.9bn , a 18 per cent leap from the same quarter last year .
And if you ignore the impact of inconvenient currency exchange rates , you can argue a 25 per cent revenue climb .
That translates to quarterly profits of $ 177 m , a 24 per jump from early 2008 .
During a conference call with analysts and reporters , chief financial officer Thomas J. Szkutak indicated that the company has noticed some sort of growth slowdown during the past two quarters .
But this hardly compares to the epic shrinkage over at eBay , which just recorded a year - over - year revenue decline for the second quarter running .
Before Q4 , eBay had never endured such a drop for even a single quarter .
" Starting in Q4 , we saw solid growth rates , but certainly not a strong as we saw from the several quarters previous to that and we saw the same thing again in Q1 , " Amazon 's Szkutak said .
In the first three quarters of last year , Amazon 's revenue growth topped 30 per cent year - on - year , the CFO said .
" But , " he added , " we 're not doing anything different than we 've done in the past . "
In addition to growing its core etail biz - sales of electronics and other general merchandise grew 38 per cent to $ 2.05 bn - it appears that Amazon is eating away at eBay 's secondhand merchandise biz .
Per usual , Amazon failed to offer specific numbers for third - party sales .
But it did say that the number of third party items shipped through its Fulfillment by Amazon service increase 300 per cent year - on - year .
In typical fashion , the company attempted to lay the credit for this ridiculously healthy quarter on its new Kindle 2 ebook .
" We 're grateful and excited that Kindle sales have exceeded our most optimistic expectations , " read a canned statement from chief executive Jeff Bezos tucked into the company 's Q1 press release .
But as usual , the company gives no indication of how many Kindles it has actually sold . ®
Yuan trade settlement to start in five Chinese cities
By Wang Xu ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-04-09 07:37
Five major trading cities have got the nod from the central government to use the yuan in overseas trade settlement - seen as one more step in China 's recent moves to expand the use of its currency globally .
Shanghai and four cities in the Pearl River Delta - Guangzhou , Shenzhen , Dongguan and Zhuhai - have been designated for the purpose , said a State Council meeting chaired by Premier Wen Jiabao yesterday .
The Pearl River Delta boasts the country 's largest cluster of export - oriented manufacturing operations .
The move is aimed at reducing the risk from exchange rate fluctuations and giving impetus to declining overseas trade , according to a statement posted on the government website .
Analysts said the experimental use of the yuan in trade settlement also reflects policymakers ' rising concern over the shaky prospects of the US currency , of which China has large reserves from previous trade growth , and their willingness to gradually expand the yuan 's use globally .
" The trial is the latest move toward making the yuan an international currency , " Huang Weiping , professor of economics at Renmin University of China , said .
" The prospect of a weaker US dollar is making the transition more imperative for China . "
The mainland is trying to promote the use of the yuan among trade partners and , in the past four months , has signed 650 billion yuan ( US95 billion ) worth of swap agreements with Argentina , Indonesia , South Korea , Malaysia , Belarus and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region .
The agreements allow them to use their yuan reserves to directly trade with the Chinese mainland within a set limit in volume .
Stephen Green , head of China Research of Standard Chartered Bank , said the swap deals would help encourage the use of the yuan as the currency of choice for international trade .
" In the longer term , if countries around the region and beyond start pricing their trade in yuan , this will also lead to increased internationalization and status for China 's currency , " Green said .
When I was younger , the most befuddling part of programming languages was the ability to create errors .
My first reaction to the throw operator in Java was , “ well that ’s stupid , why would you ever want to cause an error ? ”
Errors were the enemy to me , something I sought to avoid , so the ability to cause an error seemed like a useless and dangerous aspect of the language .
I thought it was dumb to include the same operator in JavaScript , a language that people just did n’t understand in the first place .
Now with a great deal of experience under my belt , I ’m a big fan of throwing my own errors .
Doing so can lead to easier debugging and code maintenance when done properly .
When programming , an error occurs when something unexpected happens .
Maybe the incorrect value was passed into a function or a mathematical operation had an invalid operand .
Programming languages define a base set of rules that , when deviated from , result in errors so that the developer can fix the code .
Debugging would be nearly impossible if errors were n’t thrown and reported back to you .
If everything failed silently , it would take you a long time to notice that there was an issue in the first place , let alone isolate and fix it .
Errors are the friends of developers , not enemies .
The problem with errors is that they tend to pop up in unexpected places and at unexpected times .
To make matters worse , the default error messages are usually too terse to really explain what went wrong .
JavaScript error messages are notoriously uninformative and cryptic ( especially in Internet Explorer ) , which only compounds the problem .
Imagine if an error popped up with a message that said , “ this function failed because this happened . ”
Instantly , your debugging task becomes easier .
This is the advantage of throwing your own errors .
It helps to think of errors as built - in failure cases .
It ’s always easier to plan for a failure at a particular point in code than it is to anticipate failure everywhere .
This is a very common practice in product design , not just in code .
Cars are built with crumple zones , areas of the frame that are designed to collapse in a predictable way when impacted .
Knowing how the frame will react in a crash , which parts will fail , allow the manufacturers to ensure passenger safety .
Your code can be constructed in the same way .
Even though JavaScript has come a long way in the past few years , JavaScript developers still have far less tools to aid in debugging than developers of other languages .
Throwing errors in your JavaScript is arguably more valuable than in any other language due to the difficulties around debugging .
You can throw an by using the throw operator and providing an object to throw .
Any type of object can be thrown , however , an Error object is the most typical to use :
throw new Error ( " Something bad happened . " )
When you throw an error in this way , and the error is n’t caught via a try - catch statement , the browser will display the error text in the browser ’s typical way .
For Internet Explorer , this means a little icon in the lower - left corner of the browser is displayed and a dialog with the error text is displayed when that icon is double clicked ; Firefox with Firebug installed will show the error in the console ; Safari and Chrome output the error onto the Web Inspector ; Opera shows the error in the Error Console .
In other words , it ’s treated the same way as an error that you did n’t throw .
The difference is that you get to provide the exact text to be displayed by the browser .
Instead of just line and column numbers , you can include any information that you ’ll need to successfully debug the issue .
I typically recommend that you always include the function name in the error message as well as the reason why the function failed .
Consider the following function :
function addClass ( element , className ) { element.className += " " + className ; }
This function ’s purpose is to add a new CSS class to the given element ( a very common method in JavaScript libraries ) .
But what happens if element is null ?
You ’ll get a cryptic error message such as , “ object expected . ”
Then , you ’ll need to look at the execution stack ( if your browser supports it ) to actually locate the source of the problem .
Debugging becomes much easier by throwing an error :
function addClass ( element , className ) { if ( element != null && typeof element.className == " string " ) { element.className += " " + className ; } else { throw new Error ( " addClass ( ) : First arg must be a DOM element . " ) ; } }
Discussions about accurately detecting whether an object is a DOM element or not aside , this method now provides better messaging when it fails due to an invalid element argument .
Seeing such a verbose message in your error console immediately leads you to the source of the problem .
I like to think of throwing errors as leaving post - it notes for myself as to why something failed .
Understanding how to throw errors is just one part of the equation ; understanding when to throw errors is the other .
Since JavaScript does n’t have type - or argument - checking , a lot of developers incorrectly assume that they should implement that for every function .
Doing so is impractical and can adversely affect the overall script ’s performance .
The key is to identify parts of the code that are likely to fail in a particular way and only throw errors there .
In short , only throw errors where errors will already occur .
If a function is only ever going to be called by known entities , error checking is probably not necessary ( this is the case with private functions ) ; if you cannot identify all the places where a function will be called ahead of time , then you ’ll likely need some error checking and will even more likely benefit from throwing your own errors .
The best place for throwing errors is in utility functions , those functions that are a general part of the scripting environment and may be used in any number of places .
This is precisely the case with JavaScript libraries .
All JavaScript libraries should throw errors from their public interfaces for known error conditions .
YUI / jQuery / Dojo / etc. can’t possibly anticipate when and where you ’ll be calling their functions .
It ’s their job to tell you when you ’re doing stupid things .
Why ?
Because you should n’t have to debug into their code to figure out what went wrong .
The call stack for an error should terminate in the library ’s interface , no deeper .
There ’s nothing worse than seeing an error that ’s 12 functions deep into a library ; library developers have a responsibility to prevent this from happening .
This also goes for private JavaScript libraries .
Many web applications have their own proprietary JavaScript libraries either built with or in lieu of the well - known public options .
The goal of libraries is to make developers ’ lives easier , and this is done by providing an abstraction away from the dirty implementation details .
Throwing errors helps to keep those dirty implementation details hidden safely away from developers .
JavaScript also provides a try - catch statement that is capable of intercepting thrown errors before they are handled by the browser .
Typically , developers have trouble discerning whether it ’s appropriate to throw an error or catch one using try - catch .
Errors should only be thrown in the deepest part of the application stack which , as discussed previously , typically means JavaScript libraries .
Any code that handles application - specific logic should have error handling capabilities and should therefore be catching errors thrown from the lower - level components .
Application logic always knows why it was calling a particular function and so is best suited for handling the error .
It ’s important to mention that you should never have a try - catch statement with an empty catch clause ; you should always be handling errors in some way .
This may be different in development versus production , but it must be done .
If an error happens , the answer should never be to simply wrap it in a try - catch and let it be – this masks an error rather than dealing with it .
Throwing errors in JavaScript is an art .
It takes time to feel out where the appropriate parts of your code should throw errors .
Once you figure this out , however , you ’ll find that your debugging time will decrease and your satisfaction with the code will increase .

US President Barack Obama has told the CIA it remains key to protecting the country , days after releasing memos on its harsh interrogation techniques .
In a visit to CIA HQ to boost morale , he acknowledged recent " difficult " days but told staff they were needed to fight threats from al - Qaeda and piracy .
Mr Obama has already said CIA staff would not be prosecuted for the methods , which critics say are torture .
But ex-Vice - President Dick Cheney said the techniques had produced results .
The memos revealed over the weekend that two al - Qaeda suspects were subjected to waterboarding - a technique which simulates drowning - 266 times .
Mr Cheney told Fox News that while the released memos outlined the frequency with which such techniques were used , they did not reveal their effectiveness in garnering intelligence .
Now that the memos showing the rulings of interrogation techniques had been released , he said , the Obama administration should release additional documents to show what they yielded .
" I 've now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so we can lay them out there and the American people have a chance to see what we obtained , " said Mr Cheney .
Secret sacrifices
On his first visit to the CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia , Mr Obama said he would " vigorously " protect the agency , just as it protected the US .
" Do n't be discouraged by what 's happened in the last few weeks , " Mr Obama told a large audience who applauded and cheered when he first appeared before them .
The real question - of course - is whether waterboarding is justified under any circumstances
Justin Webb
Justin Webb 's blog Interrogation ' morass ' for Obama Q&A : Water - boarding Mr Obama said he had had no choice but to release the Bush administration 's legal justification for interrogation techniques , which he considers to be torture - and has banned .
" Do n't be discouraged that we have to acknowledge that potentially we 've made some mistakes .
" That 's how we learn .
But the fact that we are willing to acknowledge them and then move forward , that is precisely why I am proud to be president of the United States and that 's why you should be proud to be members of the CIA . "
He also spoke of the public 's appreciation of the work and " sacrifices " CIA staff make , emphasising that success was usually secret but failure often resulted in public blame .
He sympathised with those who work against unscrupulous enemies , but stressed it was important for national security that the agency did not overstep certain moral boundaries .
Quoting one of the memos , The New York Times said Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the self - confessed planner of the 9/11 attacks , was subjected to the waterboarding technique , 183 times .
The method was used on another suspect , Abu Zubaydah , at least 83 times .
CIA ' still exposed ' BBC defence and security correspondent Rob Watson says this contrasts starkly with previous accounts given by US intelligence sources that implied both men told all after only the briefest exposure to the technique .
CIA staff applauded and cheered at Mr Obama 's appearance
The new information could hardly have emerged at a more sensitive time for President Obama , our correspondent says .
Though highly critical during his election campaign of the CIA 's methods , he adds , since coming to office Mr Obama has been anxious to boost morale at the agency and to draw a line under the controversies of its recent past .
The former head of the CIA , Michael Hayden , has said the release of the memos threatens national security by allowing prospective terrorists an insight into the precise limits of US interrogations .
He told Fox News network on Sunday that the release of the memos would make it more difficult to get useful information from suspected terrorists .
Other methods mentioned in the memos include week - long sleep deprivation , forced nudity and the use of painful positions .
Mr Obama on Thursday said he would not prosecute under anti-torture laws CIA personnel who relied in good faith on Bush administration legal opinions issued after the 11 September attacks .
But he has been criticised by human rights organisations and UN officials , who say charges are necessary to prevent future abuses and to hold people accountable .

Snoring can be a serious problem Nearly three - quarters of people who try over - the - counter remedies for snoring find they do not work , a survey shows .
Consumer watchdog
Which ?
then tested various remedies including nasal strips and throat sprays that nearly 2,000 of its members with snoring had tried .
Few provided relief and some disturbed the users ' sleep so much that they were reluctant to use them again .
Experts said it was important to identify the causes of snoring before seeking a remedy .
There 's no one ' cure ' for snoring as everyone snores for different reasons , and it 's important to try and pinpoint why you snore so you can try the right solution
Which ?
senior researcher Joanna Pearl A Which ?
spokesman said : " You may snore for several reasons so buying a single cure may not solve your problem . "
For example , if you snore on your back , you may be a tongue - based snorer - where the tongue falls back and impedes your airway .
If you have your mouth open , this may be the problem .
Or it could be a problem with the nose , such a misshapen nose or small , collapsing nostrils , or simple congestion or catarrh .
Other factors can play a part , including sleeping position - on your back is worse - and excess weight or alcohol consumption .
Tried and tested
The seven devices tested by seven couples for Which ?
included SnoreMender , a removable dental device to hold the jaw forward to help keep the airway open .
Although the tester found it worked , he said it was so uncomfortable that he would be reluctant to use it again .
Similarly , Snore Calm Chin - up strips reduced snoring , but the tester suspected this was only because he was awake longer due to discomfort .
Another remedy trialled was Lloydspharmacy Stop Snoring , a wrist - worn device that gives the user small electric shocks if sounds are detected so the snorer changes position without waking .
The tester said she was woken 20 times in one night and was left with marks on her arms as the pads on the electrodes did n't stay in place .
Lloydspharmacy said the device had received a lot of positive feedback from users .
The pulse setting was adjustable and had to be set high enough to interrupt the snoring and encourage the wearer to change position , but not so high as to wake them up .
SNORING FACTS
Four in every 10 ( about 15 million in total ) UK adults snore , according to estimates 10.4 million are males and 4.5 million females Men are perceived to be louder snorers than women Source : BSSAA Which ?
concluded there was some evidence that nasal strips , such as those they tested made by Breathe Right , could help the 15 - 20 % who snore because of a nasal problem .
But it said some available devices , such as the Snore No More wire device that fits in the nostrils and a throat spray called Helps Stop Snoring , had little or no direct evidence yet to support their claims .
The Singing for Snorers CD , a three - month exercise programme designed to tone the muscles , provided some relief , although Which ?
says it is not clear whether snoring is caused by untoned muscles .
No cure all Which ?
senior researcher Joanna Pearl said : " People can spend hundreds of pounds trying to cure snoring , but in a survey of nearly 2,000 Which ?
online panel members , 71 % found that the snoring aid they bought was not very or not at all effective .
" There 's no one ' cure ' for snoring as everyone snores for different reasons , and it 's important to try and pinpoint why you snore so you can try the right solution .
" Before you buy , see what you can do yourself and rule out potential health problems such as severe sleep apnoea .
And talk to a health professional such as a GP or dentist if it does n't improve . "
Obstructive sleep apnoea is a condition which causes interruptions in breathing during sleep and may harm the snorer .
Beccy Mullins , a clinical nurse specialist who runs a number of sleep - disordered breathing clinics throughout the UK , said : " Since untreated sleep apnoea may contribute to other serious illnesses , such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease I would recommend that anyone who has a snoring issue , considers the possibility of this condition . "
Marianne Davey , of the British Snoring & Sleep Apnoea Association , said there were many causes of snoring , and a device would only stand a chance of working if given to a patient whose snoring was caused by the specific problem the treatment was designed to tackle .
Simply trying out a device without first pinning down the cause of the problem was doomed to failure .

“ WANT IT ! ” screamed the words plastered on the walls , counters and shopping bags in the flagship emporium of Saks , a big American retailer , on Fifth Avenue in New York .
The same exhortation was emblazoned in huge letters on a giant red and white ball that revolved slowly in the middle of the main sales floor .
Saks 's spring marketing campaign , which came to an end on April 1st , made its brazen appeal to greed in a bid to drum up sales in a dire market .
But the exclamation mark in its “ Want It ! ” tagline should perhaps have been a question mark instead .
Asked whether they want more stuff , consumers in rich countries have responded with an emphatic “ No ” .
The breathtaking speed with which retail sales have plummeted in both America and Europe ( see chart ) has caught retailers and manufacturers by surprise .
In response , companies have tried desperately to prop up revenues using a variety of promotions , advertising and other marketing ploys , often to no avail .
But as they battle with these immediate problems , marketers are also pondering what longer - term changes in consumer behaviour have been triggered by the recession .
It is tempting to conclude that , once economies rebound , customers will start spending again as they did before .
Yet there are good reasons to think that what promises to be the worst downturn since the Depression will spark profound shifts in shoppers ' psychology .
The biggest changes will take place in America and parts of Europe , where housing and stockmarket bubbles have imploded and unemployment has soared .
As well as seeing their incomes fall as employers cut wages and jobs , households have also seen the value of their homes and retirement savings shrink dramatically .
Although the threat to wages will fade as growth picks up , the damage done to housing and other assets will linger .
This has already led to a swift tightening of purse strings by shoppers and a wave of discounting by companies .
Inmar , an American firm that processes discount coupons , says that redemptions in America were 17 % higher in the first quarter of 2009 than in the same period last year , as consumers hunted for bargains .
Many companies have launched lower - priced products in order to avoid losing customers as they trade down .
Danone , a French food group , has created a line of low - cost yogurts in Europe , called “ €co Packs ” , that come in smaller tubs and fewer flavours than its standard products .
The trend towards thrift will not disappear when the economy picks up .
For one thing , those banks left standing after the bust will be far more parsimonious with consumer credit .
For another , many people will still be intent on rebuilding their nest - eggs , which is reflected in sharply rising rates of saving .
Sociologists also detect a distinct change in people 's behaviour .
Until the downturn , folk had come to assume that “ affluence ” was the norm , even if they had to go deeply into debt to pay for gadgets and baubles .
Now many people no longer seem consumed by the desire to consume ; instead , they are planning to live within their means , and there has been a backlash against bling .
So for years to come , many more households will be firmly focused on saving , splashing out only occasionally on a big - ticket item .
Some firms are already trying to capitalise on this new mood .
Sears , another American retailer , recently revived a savings plan it used many years ago , known as the “ Layaway programme ” , under which a consumer can make a down payment on an item that is then held for him for a fixed period while he saves the rest of the cash needed to buy it .
A second shift in consumer psychology has been prompted by fallout from the global banking crisis and the furore over huge bonuses paid by firms rescued with public money ; by a wave of financial scandals , such as the Madoff affair in America ; and by multibillion - dollar bail - outs of carmakers in many countries .
All this seems to be denting trust in business more generally .
The Boston Consulting Group recently completed a global survey of consumer sentiment involving 15,000 consumers .
The results , to be published this month , show that over half of respondents from America and Europe say the crisis has intensified their distrust of big business .
Past downturns have also stoked anti-business feeling , which dissipated as growth returned .
But the sheer scale of the failings that have come to light recently mean that suspicion and wariness will not vanish so easily this time around .
In response , firms will need to be even more transparent in their dealings with customers , who will punish them severely if they fail to keep their promises .
Bain , another consulting firm , says it has seen several firms appoint executives recently with a specific brief to ensure that price adjustments and service cuts do not damage loyal customers ' experience of brands .
Companies will also need to show they empathise with consumers ' new concerns .
“ There will need to be a move from passion to compassion in marketing , ” reckons John Gerzema of Young & Rubicam , a marketing - services firm .
Hyundai , a South Korean carmaker , has taken the hint .
In January it said that for a 12 - month period it would allow car buyers to return vehicles without incurring a penalty if they lose their jobs .
On March 31st Ford and General Motors followed Hyundai 's example , saying they would make payments on car loans and leases for a limited period on behalf of buyers who are laid off .
Both the shift towards greater thrift and greater scepticism about brands will influence other consumer trends , too .
Interest in things such as green products and healthy foods will continue to grow in a post - crisis world , but customers will be less willing to pay a premium for them , and will demand more value for money when they do .
The downturn will also accelerate the use of social media , such as blogs and social - networking sites , by consumers looking for intelligence on firms and their products .
As trust in brands is eroded , people will place more value on recommendations from friends .
Social media make it harder for brands to pull the wool over consumers ' eyes , but they also offer canny companies a powerful new channel through which to promote their wares and test new products and pricing strategies .
Marketers ignore the messages that emanate from these groups at their peril .
For one thing is clear : this recession has triggered a wholesale reappraisal by shoppers of the value that their habitual brands deliver .
The winners will be those that adapt intelligently to the new reality .
The losers will be those who think they can win simply by telling consumers to “ Want It ! ”

All is not well in Obamafanland .
It ’s not clear exactly what accounts for the change of mood .
Maybe it was the rancid smell emanating from Treasury ’s latest bank bailout .
Or the news that the president ’s chief economic adviser , Larry Summers , earned millions from the very Wall Street banks and hedge funds he is protecting from reregulation now .
Or perhaps it began earlier , with Obama ’s silence during Israel ’s Gaza attack .
Whatever the last straw , a growing number of Obama enthusiasts are starting to entertain the possibility that their man is not , in fact , going to save the world if we all just hope really hard .
This is a good thing .
If the superfan culture that brought Obama to power is going to transform itself into an independent political movement , one fierce enough to produce programs capable of meeting the current crises , we are all going to have to stop hoping and start demanding .
The first stage , however , is to understand fully the awkward in - between space in which many U.S. progressive movements find themselves .
To do that , we need a new language , one specific to the Obama moment .
Here is a start .
Hopeover .
Like a hangover , a hopeover comes from having overindulged in something that felt good at the time but was n’t really all that healthy , leading to feelings of remorse , even shame .
It ’s the political equivalent of the crash after a sugar high .
Sample sentence : “ When I listened to Obama ’s economic speech my heart soared .
But then , when I tried to tell a friend about his plans for the millions of layoffs and foreclosures , I found myself saying nothing at all .
I ’ve got a serious hopeover . ”
Hoper coaster .
Like a roller coaster , the hoper coaster describes the intense emotional peaks and valleys of the Obama era , the veering between joy at having a president who supports safe - sex education and despondency that single - payer healthcare is off the table at the very moment when it could actually become a reality .
Sample sentence : “ I was so psyched when Obama said he is closing Guantánamo .
But now they are fighting like mad to make sure the prisoners in Bagram have no legal rights at all .
Stop this hoper coaster — I want to get off ! ”
Hopesick .
Like the homesick , hopesick individuals are intensely nostalgic .
They miss the rush of optimism from the campaign trail and are forever trying to recapture that warm , hopey feeling — usually by exaggerating the significance of relatively minor acts of Obama decency .
Sample sentences : “ I was feeling really hopesick about the escalation in Afghanistan , but then I watched a YouTube video of Michelle in her organic garden and it felt like inauguration day all over again .
A few hours later , when I heard that the Obama administration was boycotting a major U.N. racism conference , the hopesickness came back hard .
So I watched slideshows of Michelle wearing clothes made by ethnically diverse independent fashion designers , and that sort of helped . ”
Hope fiend .
With hope receding , the hope fiend , like the dope fiend , goes into serious withdrawal , willing to do anything to chase the buzz .
( Closely related to hopesickness but more severe , usually affecting middle - aged males . )
Sample sentence : “ Joe told me he actually believes Obama deliberately brought in Summers so that he would blow the bailout , and then Obama would have the excuse he needs to do what he really wants : nationalize the banks and turn them into credit unions .
What a hope fiend ! ”
Hopebreak .
Like the heartbroken lover , the hopebroken Obama - ite is not mad but terribly sad .
She projected messianic powers onto Obama and is now inconsolable in her disappointment .
Sample sentence : “ I really believed Obama would finally force us to confront the legacy of slavery in this country and start a serious national conversation about race .
But now he never seems to mention race , and he ’s using twisted legal arguments to keep us from even confronting the crimes of the Bush years .
Every time I hear him say ” ˜move forward , ’ I ’m hopebroken all over again . ”
Hopelash .
Like a backlash , hopelash is a 180 - degree reversal of everything Obama - related .
Sufferers were once Obama ’s most passionate evangelists .
Now they are his angriest critics .
Sample sentence : “ At least with Bush everyone knew he was an asshole .
Now we ’ve got the same wars , the same lawless prisons , the same Washington corruption , but everyone is cheering like Stepford wives .
It ’s time for a full - on hopelash . ”
In trying to name these various hope - related ailments , I found myself wondering what the late Studs Terkel would have said about our collective hopeover .
He surely would have urged us not to give in to despair .
I reached for one of his last books , Hope Dies Last .
I did n’t have to read long .
The book opens with the words : “ Hope has never trickled down .
It has always sprung up . ”
And that pretty much says it all .
Hope was a fine slogan when rooting for a long - shot presidential candidate .
But as a posture toward the president of the most powerful nation on earth , it is dangerously deferential .
The task as we move forward ( as Obama likes to say ) is not to abandon hope but to find more appropriate homes for it — in the factories , neighborhoods and schools where tactics like sit-ins , squats and occupations are seeing a resurgence .
Political scientist Sam Gindin wrote recently that the labor movement can do more than protect the status quo .
It can demand , for instance , that shuttered auto plants be converted into green - future factories , capable of producing mass - transit vehicles and technology for a renewable energy system .
“ Being realistic means taking hope out of speeches , ” he wrote , “ and putting it in the hands of workers . ”
Which brings me to the final entry in the lexicon .
Hoperoots .
Sample sentence : “ It ’s time to stop waiting for hope to be handed down , and start pushing it up , from the hoperoots . ”
Naomi Klein ’s column was first published in The Nation .
( Newser ) – Backing what he calls " a sound conservative argument , " a top McCain campaign operative is explaining his newly public personal support for gay marriage , CNN reports .
Steve Schmidt will address the Log Cabin Republicans today and urge them to reverse their position .
“ No other exercise of one 's liberty comes with greater responsibilities than marriage , ” an advance text says .
“ It can not be argued that marriage between people of the same sex is un American or threatens the rights of others , ” contends Schmidt , whose sister is gay .
He also makes a political argument for abandoning the stance of his 2008 candidate , who lost voters under 30 by a wide margin .
" We need to grow our coalition , but that 's hard to do if we lose some votes while gaining others , " he says .

Because the web is a changing and ever evolving organism , it ’s important to build sites that can grow with it and easily ride the current instead of drowning when a new wave approaches .
Clean markup and building with web standards not only helps you do this , but will save you both time and money in the long run .
As the web expands , so the technologies that it uses grow with it .
While HTML has been around for a long time , it has acquired quite a few sidekicks along the way .
First Javascript , then CSS , XML and later AJAX .
Wide adoption of HTML 5 is just around the corner , with Firefox , Safari , Opera and Chrome already enjoying nearly full HTML 5 support ( the slow kid on the block , Internet Explorer , is lagging behind as usual ) .
In this article , we ’ll review the basics of web standards , what they are , what they mean to you , and some important tips to help you deal with this important and often neglected issue .
What Does it Mean to Have “ Clean ” Markup ?
Simply put , it means free of clutter , standards - compliant , and using the tags and structures of each language for their intended purpose .
Clutter - free HTML makes sparse use of tags , eliminates the extraneous and accomplishes its task with as little markup as necessary .
It avoids needless attributes , such as inline CSS , and leaves each document structured and organized .
Likewise , clutter - free CSS should avoid repeating itself , take advantage of inheritance ( remember , CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet ) and re-use classes whenever possible .
Standards - compliant means that your pages validate with the standards laid out by the W3C for HTML , CSS , and XML .
It means using the free W3C validators to check for errors , correcting them and testing again until you ’re as close to 100 % valid as possible .
Why Should I Care ?
It Works , Is n’t That Enough ?
Every project has an aggressive deadline and every client wants their site launched yesterday .
So as web developers and designers we are under constant pressure to work faster and more efficiently .
It ’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking fast must mean sloppy , and that clean , standards - compliant markup takes more time .
It ’s easy to just say “ it works and that ’s all that matters . ”
Sure , it works … for now , for you .
What about next year , or three years from now ?
What about new browsers ?
What about accessibility ?
Do you really think that the major search engines will adhere to special , sloppy coding methods ?
They ’re finicky , and if you are not standards compliant you ’re kicking your search ranking in the face .
What about the next poor sap that has to edit these pages you ’ve created ?
What happens if you get hit by a bus , quit to go backpacking in Alaska , or get abducted by aliens ?
Someone else has to pick up where you left off and he ’ll be looking at your code , trying to make sense of it .
Will it be easy , or will it give him a headache and make him curse your name ?
Do it right the first time .
This is n’t just some annoying , fatherly life - lesson .
It will actually save you both time and money , and make those that follow you have an easier time of things .
You may think it ’s faster to just drop in the inline CSS instead of properly adding a new class to your style sheet .
And you may think it ’s faster to toss in whatever HTML you can spit out without considering the overall document structure .
When it comes time to update that document later or redesign the whole site , you ’ll spend much more time making up for sloppy code than you ever saved by rushing through it in the first place .
When you create a new style sheet , those pesky inline styles you hastily added will come back to haunt you and you ’ll spend hours hunting them down and stripping them out .
Extensibility , Accessibility , Translation and Future Proofing
Mobile browsing is growing like Godzilla on atomic - steroids .
Instead of being relegated to the jet - setting Blackberry addicts from 5 years ago , today everyone is using their phone to surf the web .
Assistive technology - screen readers for the blind and alternate interface devices for the handicapped - is common , and you do n’t want to lose a sale or alienate traffic just because you did n’t take that into account .
Your site is likely to be translated into a half - dozen languages as readers from around the world find your content .
Thanks to the Internet Archive , Google ’s cache and others , pages you publish today will be around for a long , long time even after they ’ve been removed from your live site .
Clean markup and standards - compliance will go a long way to ensure your sites work in each of these scenarios .
Do ’s and Don’ts :
DO use tags as they are intended .
For example : h1 is the first top - level element on the page , then h2 , h3 and so on .
There should only be one h1 tag per page .

For example : if you set a font on a container , you do n’t need to specify it again on every child element unless that child element needs to use a different font .
This will keep your style sheets lean and quick to load .

Crazy basketball fan
This is one really crazy basketball fan !
Video is from Greece basketball match between AEK and Olympiakos .
Ayear and a half ago , researchers found that a deadly form of staph infection was prevalent on Canadian pig farms .
This year , the superbug was found in both swine and workers at U.S. farms .
The rise of bacteria such as methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA , which kills more people in this country each year than AIDS , is believed to be a consequence of the overuse of antibiotics in humans and animals .
Low doses of the medications have become ubiquitous in the livestock industry , mixed into feed to enhance growth and prevent the diseases that sweep through crowded pens .
A panel of experts found “ clear evidence of adverse human health consequences due to resistant organisms resulting from nonhuman usage of antimicrobials , ” the World Health Organization reported in 2004 .
“ These consequences include infections that would not have otherwise occurred , increased frequency of treatment failures ( in some cases death ) and increased severity of infections . ”
The European Union has already banned non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in farm animals , but each year lobbying by agribusiness in this country dooms legislation that would do the same .
On Tuesday , Rep. Louise M. Slaughter ( D - N.Y. ) introduced a bill that would restrict the use of antibiotics that are important to human health in farming operations .
The medications could be used to treat illness , but not as a growth promoter or as a substitute for cleaner living conditions .
The bill might have a better chance of passing now , with a stronger Democratic majority in Congress .
The timing is right in other ways as well .
In January , the Department of Agriculture -- responsible for promoting the meat industry as well as consumer health -- reported that , except during the nursery stage for young pigs , the costs of using preventive or growth - promoting antibiotics slightly outweighed the economic benefits for farms .
That ’s not counting the added costs to consumers in prescription prices for more exotic antibiotics or the $ 4 billion a year this country spends to combat resistant infections .
Some farms are successfully using better sanitation and tracking of illnesses among their herds instead of preventive antibiotics .
It would be a mistake to delay restrictions on antibiotic use until the situation has a chance to reach dire proportions ; there is no guarantee that specialized antibiotics could be developed in time to thwart a new wave of drug - resistant bacteria .
Humans do n’t need antibiotics to treat common colds , which are caused by viruses rather than bacteria , and animals do n’t need them to grow .

725.35 meters .
A whoppumental 2,379.75 feet .
That 's how big the new super - sized Enterprise is .
Here you can see it compared against the Galactica , the good old Enterprise , the Blockade Runner , and the ISS .

When JJ Abrams said that he wanted to put some Star Wars into Star Trek , apparently it also applied to the scale of spaceships .
And while the new Enterprise does n't even reach half of the 1,600 meters — that 's a mile long — of an Imperial Star Destroyer , it 's still amazingly big compared to the 288 meters of the old Enterprise .
Maybe now you would be able to take down an Star Destroyer with a couple of these .
How much would it cost to build this thing today ?
This much .
libexplain 1.4
The library is not quite a drop - in replacement for strerror , but it comes close .
Each system call has a dedicated libexplain function , for example
fd = open ( path , flags , mode ) ; if ( fd < 0 ) { fprintf ( stderr , " %s
" , explain_open ( path , flags , mode ) ) ; exit( EXIT_FAILURE ) ; }
‘ I think it 's totally awesome , in the category of “ why has n't this existed for n years ” awesome . ’ — Parker san
no - such - dir / some - file
open ( pathname = " no-such - dir/ some - file " , flags = O_RDONLY ) failed , No such file or directory ( 2 , ENOENT ) because there is no " no- such - dir " directory in the current directory
The good news is that for each of these functions there is a wrapper function , in this case explain_open_or_die ( 3 ) , that includes the above code fragment .
Adding good error reporting is as simple as using a different , but similarly named , function .
The library also provides thread safe variants of each explanation function .
The coverage for system calls is being improved all the time , as you can see from this documentation page generated from the source code .
Coverage includes 221 system calls and 547 ioctl requests .
Documentation
The LCA 2010 talk , “ No medium found : when it 's time to stop trying to read strerror 's mind ” is a available as PDF , and the slides are available as HTML .

There is full documentation of all API functions .
This is the interface users of the library may use .
There is full documentation of all internal functions .

The iPhone was charging .
Refined , introverted , mysteriously chilled , my new $ 200 tile of technology lay supine on a side table , gulping power from the wall .
Actually , the iPhone probably sips , like a lipsticky girl with a vodka drink .
It usually does things in a cute way .
Whatever .
At 4 in the morning , I was in bed , fighting rage .
I could n’t stop thinking about that device ’s tarty little face and those yapping “ apps ” you can download for it .
The whole iPhone enterprise seemed to require so much attention , organization , explanation , praise , electricity .
I know — I know : in the morning , Apple ’s latest miracle machine would fill my palm with meaning and magic .
So why could n’t I contain my annoyance ?
I had no new - thing excitement .
It dawned on me : I hated my iPhone .
I was late to get one — and maybe that ’s the problem .
Maybe my hopes for the iPhone curdled in the time it took for my perfectly good T - Mobile plan to expire so I could switch to balky AT&T and purchase one .
But I had bided my time .
And , really , my enthusiasm survived right up to the moment at the AT&T counter , post - sale , when a saleswoman transferred my address book from my battered BlackBerry to the sweetie - pie iPhone .
“ Can you set up my e-mail too ? ” I asked .
She handed me the phone and told me what to type .
Pressing her good nature , I asked if she ’d do that part too , since I was n’t yet handy with the iPhone ’s character - entry system — the 2D screen - based simulation of the qwerty keyboard .
Leon Panetta said the CIA no longer used harsh interrogation techniques
The US has stopped running its global network of secret prisons , CIA director Leon Panetta has announced .
" CIA no longer operates detention facilities or black sites , " Mr Panetta said in a letter to staff .
Remaining sites would be decommissioned , he said .
The " black sites " were used to detain terrorism suspects , some of whom were subjected to interrogation methods described by many as torture .
President Obama vowed to shut down the facilities shortly after taking office .
The Bush administration allowed the CIA to operate secret prisons on the territory of allied countries in Eastern Europe , Asia and Africa , according to media reports .
During his first week as president , Mr Obama ordered the closure of the black sites , as well as the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , as part of an overhaul of US detainee policy .
Key issue
In his letter , Mr Panetta also stressed that the CIA no longer employed controversial " harsh interrogation techniques " , like " waterboarding " , or simulated drowning , which have been widely condemned .
" CIA officers do not tolerate , and will continue to promptly report , any inappropriate behaviour or allegations of abuse , " he said .
He also announced that the CIA was no longer allowing outside " contractors " to carry out interrogations .
But the CIA retains the power to detain suspects " on a short - term transitory basis " .
The BBC's Kevin Connolly says Mr Panetta 's statement has an impressive ring , but the CIA 's secret prisons may never have been elaborate affairs in themselves and decommissioning may be straightforward .
The key issue for the Obama administration , our correspondent adds , will be its policy towards suspects who fall into its hands , not the buildings in which they are held .

The family said they found the image comforting
Enlarge Image
It may not be immediately obvious to everyone , but one family are convinced they can see the face of Jesus on the lid of a jar of Marmite .
Claire Allen , 36 , said she was the first to notice the image on the underside of the lid as she was putting the yeast spread on her son 's toast .
Her husband Gareth , 37 , said he could not believe his eyes when he saw it .
Mr Allen , of Ystrad , Rhondda , said : " The kids are still eating it , but we kept the lid . "
He explained : " Claire saw it first and called her dad to come and take a photo of it .
" When I first looked at it I was n't sure , but when I moved it away from me it started coming out .
I thought yeah , she 's right - that 's the image of Jesus .
People might think I 'm nuts , but I like to think it 's Jesus looking out for us
Claire Allen Mrs Allen said her 14 - year - old son Jamie had also remarked on the likeness .
She told the South Wales Echo : " Straight away Jamie said ' that looks like God ' , and my other boys ( Robbie , four , and Tomas , 11 ) even said they could see a face .
" People might think I 'm nuts , but I like to think it 's Jesus looking out for us .
" We 've had a tough couple of months ; my mum 's been really ill and it's comforting to think that if he is there , he 's watching over us . "

Advertisement A British couple who were both suffering from terminal cancer have died at a voluntary euthanasia clinic in Switzerland .
Peter and Penelope Duff , from Bath , ended their lives at the Dignitas clinic in Zurich last Friday .
Their daughter Helena Conibear said her father , who was 80 , and her mother , who was 70 , had " passed away peacefully together " at the centre .
It is not known exactly how Mr and Mrs Duff died .
Mr Duff had been suffering from colon and liver cancer and his wife had been suffering from a rare form of cancer .
Their decision in no way reflected on the wonderful and humbling care they have received from their consultant , doctors and nurses
Duff family statement Mr Duff was a respected expert on wine and the couple were well - known patrons of the arts in Bath , including the city 's annual festival .
In a statement , the family said : '' Peter and Penny Duff passed away peacefully together in Zurich , after a long battle against their terminal cancer , on 27 February .
'' Penny had fought a rare cancer , GIST ( gastrointestinal stromal tumour ) , since 1992 and Peter 's colon cancer had spread to his liver .
'' Their decision in no way reflected on the wonderful and humbling care they have received from their consultant , doctors and nurses , for which the family , and they , were so appreciative . "
' Sad case ' A spokesman for the Bath Festival , said : '' They were great patrons of the arts who supported our festivals for many years , although their chief involvement was with music . "
One hundred British people are said to have been helped to die by the centre in Switzerland .
Dignitas , which has operated in and around Zurich for 10 years , said the figure was reached in October 2008 .
A spokesman for the anti-euthanasia group Care Not Killing said : " This is a desperately sad and unusual case of a couple in a state of distress .
" However , hard cases make bad law and the fact remains that if euthanasia was ever legalised in Britain vulnerable and seriously ill people would come under pressure to end their lives prematurely . "

ANN ARBOR , Mich. , April 16 ( UPI ) -- A U.S. researcher has developed a working vaccine for a strain of E. coli that kills 2 million to 3 million children annually in the developing world .
Mahdi Saeed of Michigan State University 's colleges of Veterinary Medicine and Human Medicine said that enterotoxigenic E. Coli is responsible for 60 percent to 70 percent of all E. coli diarrheal disease , also causes health problems for U.S. troops serving overseas and is responsible for what is commonly called traveler 's diarrhea .

" This strain of E. coli is an international health challenge that has a huge impact on humanity , " Saeed said in a statement .
" By creating a vaccine , we can save untold lives .
The implications are massive . "
Saeed discovered a way to overcome the minuscule molecular size of one of the illness - inducing toxins produced by the E. coli bug .
Because the toxin was so small , it did not prompt the body 's defense system to develop immunity , allowing the same individual to repeatedly get sick .
After creating the carrier in a laboratory , Saeed and the team tested it on mice and found the biological activity of the toxin was enhanced by more than 40 percent , leading to its recognition by the body 's immune system .
The researchers immunized a group of 10 rabbits .
The vaccine led to the production of the highest neutralizing antibody ever reported for this type of the toxin , Saeed said .
Fail usually follows a pretty standard lifecycle , starting from a embryo of an idea in someone ’s mind , until it grows into a beautiful rainbow chrysalis in their wild fantasies .
Then comes the implementation , and the results are usually hilarious .
Lets take a guided tour through the genesis of an epic failure , as our random noob wakes up one morning hoping to change the world .
National Epic Fail
Mr Conroy wakes up one morning and checks his email .
“ Sweet Baby Jesus ! ” , he exclaims , “ 3 laws said ‘ Fuck ’ on my kids ’ internet , and something must be done ! ” .
Then he realizes that despite having the technological ability of a goldfish he has somehow ended up as the Minister for Communications .
He thinks of his daughter reading on the internet about his failures regarding the National Broadband Network , and knows that some content must be blocked .
For the children !
Suddenly , in an orgasm of misconceptions , confusion , and desperation a Fail is born .
You see , a noob will always attack a problem with a predefined plan : “ I need to achieve X by doing Y ” .
The Fail will swim around in the mind slowly growing and strengthening , until the parent is utterly convinced of how he will change the world with this exact plan .
The experts are called in .
We tell them that achieving X is more difficult than they thought , and that Y definitely is n’t the way to go about it , for several reasons .
We offer alternatives , but they are n’t Y , so our recommendations are ignored .
Parental Advisory : Do Some Fucking Parenting
Noobs seem to be able to continue to build truly epic failures , despite clear evidence that things are just not working .
They beaver away , singing “ Tra - la - la - ladies - blocking - the - ladies ” with a big dumb grin on their face .
The bemused look on their face when the monster they have built turns around and starts violently raping them is quite hilarious .
Guess that dream of being able to go fuck a mistress while the magic technology looks after your children for you is n’t going to happen Stevie ?
Conroy is looking surprised that his blacklist leaked , and is n’t 100 % illegal content .
The lead developer here is still confused when the ‘ push messaging without rate control ’ sometimes chokes up servers .
Fuck .
We told you retards this would happen .
There is a silver lining to this cloud .
The experts got paid .
First Law .

If there are pliers inside the trunk they may help you grip the cable .
If the car is equipped with a cable trunk release that can be operated from inside the car ( usually by a lever near the driver 's seat ) , you may be able to pull the cable and open the trunk latch .
Pull up the carpet on the floor of the trunk , or pull of the cardboard paneling , and feel for a cable .
It will typically be on the driver 's side of the car .
If no cable is there , search along the side of the trunk .
If you locate a cable , pull on it ( pulling toward the front of the car ) to open the trunk .
Pulling the cable toward the front or side of the car will pull up the release handle on the trunk .
Jeeves has been given a makeover for the relaunch Search engine Ask is reverting to its original name , Ask Jeeves , as it reintroduces the iconic fictional butler into its corporate branding .
Jeeves was dropped from the brand in 2006 as the search engine began a series of facelifts aimed at increasing market share and gaining on Google .
At the time there was a brief campaign from users to have him reinstated .
Ask says the return of the valet , based on a character created by PG Wodehouse , is in response to " user demand " .
Managing director Cesar Mascaraque denied the rethink was a last - ditch effort to gain ground on market leader Google .
" We have seen a growth of 20 % this year , so we are not struggling , " he said .
" We have been focused on developing an outstanding producer that will deliver outstanding results and Jeeves is just the icing on the cake .
" Our aim is to give our users the answers they need for the lives they lead and Jeeves 's role is to give our users answers in a more human way . "
But Peter Matthews , manager of the brand and digital consultancy Nucleus , said Ask needed to put some clear blue water between itself and Google .
Ask without Jeeves lacked character and while the actual product - searching the web - is very effective , in trying to be more like Google they shot themselves in the foot
Nucleus manager , Peter Matthews
" Ask is struggling , as all search engines other than Google are , " he said .
" With Google , you get 90 % of the market , so the other search engines - Yahoo , MSN , AOL , Ask to name but a few - are all trying to grab a share of the remaining 10 % . "
The search engine has been through a series of rebrands , including a TV advertising campaign portraying it as an underground alternative to Google .
In the autumn of 2008 it had another makeover , this time branding itself as the search engine that could best answer specific questions .
Mr Matthews added : " Ask Jeeves was quite a strong brand , in the sense it had brand values that were different from everyone else .
" Ask without Jeeves lacked character and while the actual product - searching the web - is very effective , in trying to be more like Google they shot themselves in the foot .
" The opportunity for Jeeves would be to get the site to be used as it was first intended - not by putting in a few key words , but by asking it a proper question .
" Not only have they got a brand issue , but they need to be famous for answering questions rather than producing reams of search results . "

Olbermann to McCain : Earmark spending is not an issue David Edwards and Joe Byrne
Published : Wednesday March 4 , 2009
Print This Email
This A $ 410 billion annual spending bill is making its way through the Senate and is expected to be signed by Obama on Friday .
The bill contains nine spending units that would fund domestic agencies and the State Department until September 30th .
Democratic leaders hope to pass it in time for President Obama to sign it by Friday , when a stopgap funding measure expires .
However , Senators from both sides of the aisle have taken issue with the $ 7.7 billion taken up by 8500 attributed earmarks , pet projects supported by local and state constituents that get tagged on to congressional spending bills .
Senator Feingold , a Democrat from Wisconsin , told reporters ,  I have typically not voted for omnibus bills because they always end up like this ,  referring to the earmarks .
John McCain , more than anyone else , has put up the most vocal resistance to the earmarks on this year 's spending bill .
 So much for the promise of change ,  McCain hypothetically addressed Obama from the Senate floor yesterday .
 In all the years I 've been coming to this floor to complain about the earmark pork - barrel corruption that this system has bred , this may be ... probably the worst ,  McCain said , pounding on the podium for emphasis .
The Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday against McCain 's measure to strip the earmarks from the omnibus spending bill , 63 - 32 .
Keith Olbermann of MSNBC 's Countdown has a few reasons why blaming Obama for an earmark frenzy is ludicrous .
 Is this the change Mr. Obama promised ? 
Olbermann asks .
 The bill was negotiated by Congressional Democrats and Republicans in December . 
 Mr. Obama 's campaign promise was that he would limit earmarks to the earmark total from 1994 ,  Olbermann adds .
The earmarks on this bill fall short of Obama 's promised earmark spending by a hundred million dollars .
But Olbermann has more evidence to refute McCain 's claim that this a record level of earmarks .
 In 2006 , the last of several years of Republican earmark orgies , Congressional earmarks totaled $ 29 billion . 
The $ 787 billion economic stimulus bill , passed by Congress on February 15 , was completely free of earmarks .
This was urged by Obama in the creation of the bill and enforced by top Democrats .
 The Obama White House is already in talks with Congressional Democrats to reform the earmark process .
An announcement is expected by the time Obama signs the ' omnibus ' bill ,  Olbermann declares .
If McCain has someone to blame for the 8500 earmarks in this year 's spending bill , it 's not Obama .

14 - year - old Christian girl raped and forced to convert to Islam
CLAAS is calling on the Pakistani Government to ban forced conversions after a group of Muslim men raped a 14 - year - old Christian girl and forced her to convert to Islam .
The case of schoolgirl Shaj Taj was referred to CLAAS by Sharing Life Ministry Pakistan .
Shah Taj told a representative of SLMP that Talat Rizwan , Mikael But and Faisal Butt bundled her into the back of a car while she was on her way to school on December 5 , 2008 .
They allegedly took her to a hotel where she was raped by Mikael before being forced at gunpoint to add her thumb print and signature to documents declaring her supposed conversion to Islam and marriage to Mikael .
“ I tried to make noise but they pointed gun on me and threatened me that they will kill my father in jail and my school - going younger brother if I make the noise , ” she told SLMP .
Shah Taj was freed from her abductors by police after being held for around one month and a case was filed against the three men .
The perpetrators then allegedly tried to prove their innocence by presenting the forged documents as legitimate certificates of marriage and conversion to Islam .
Police have detained two of the attackers , but a third is still on the run .
Shah Taj told SLMP she wants her attackers behind bars : “ I want to rejoin my school but I am afraid of the culprits .
They had guns .
They are very dangerous people .
I hate that people who caused me to leave my school , they kidnapped me and raped me that ’s why they must go in prison and be punished . ”
CLAAS has offered Shah Taj free legal representation after her mother said that the family could not afford to take legal action against the men because of their financial difficulties .
Christian political and religious leaders in Lahore have so far failed to come forward to help the family .
CLAAS Coordinator Nasir Saeed made an urgent appeal to the Pakistani Government to pass legislation banning forced conversions .
He commented : “ The forced conversion of a non-Muslim minor to Islam is a trend that is spiralling out of control , especially since the recent imposition of Sharia law and the increasing Talibanisation of Pakistan . ”
Following public demand : 2 extra Pic - a - Pix puzzles will be available each week
Following public demand , an additional B &W Pic - a - Pix and 2Color Pic - a - Pix puzzles will become available in My Pic - a - Pix starting November 21 .
Thus , the weekly dose in My Pic - a - Pix will be increased to 6 puzzles including three B&W , two Color and one 2 Color each week .
To further spice up the dish , one of the 6 puzzles will be a Mega Pic - a - Pix each month .
The additional puzzles are the result of requests from many avid solvers who desperately needed more quality puzzles to finish the week .
To see which kind of Pic - a - Pix puzzles our community wants members were invited to participate in a poll earlier in September asking " If we add a puzzle to My Pic - a - Pix , what would you prefer ? "
By the time the poll was finalized , more than 2000 enthusiastic members cast their vote making it the most popular topic ever posted on the forum .
A wider range of sizes and difficulty levels
" We were continuously getting requests for more Pic - a - Pix puzzles " says Natalia Shrira , Conceptis puzzle editor " but different people enjoy different sizes , colors and difficulty levels so the poll was a great way to find out what they really want .
The new weekly selection will provide a wider range of sizes and levels , including some real challenges every week . "

The French Polynesian atolls , of Mururoa [ 21°52 'S 138°55 ' W ] and Fangataufa [ 22°14 'S 138°45 'W ] ( atolls of the Tuamutu ) in the South are known as the Pacific Test Center .
These sites were chosen by the French state for the different types of testing because of their relative isolation and geological characteristics .
From the geographical point of view , Mururoa , the largest of the two atolls , with a perimeter of 60 kilometers , was 40 kilometers away from Fangataufa .
These two Polynesian territories are part of France , although they are some 20 000 kilometres away from the metropolis .
The test sites were created on 21st September 1962 and the Direction des Centres d'Experimentation Nucleaires ( DIRCEN ) was made responsible for organising and exploiting firings .
Hao , 450 kilometres north - west of Mururoa , was chosen as advanced support base .
Considerable modernisation work was carried out there for this purpose .
The first tests conducted at the Mururoa and Fangataufa sites were atmospheric .
After 41 tests in the atmosphere , underground tests were started in June 1975 .
In all , 41 tests in the atmosphere and 134 tests in boreholes in the atolls ( from the edge of the atolls or in the central zone ) were conducted between 1960 and 1991 on Mururoa and Fangataufa .
Added to those in the Sahara , France had thus conducted a total of 192 tests up to 1992 .
On 8th April 1992 , President Francois Mitterrand , through his Prime Minister , announced the suspension of French nuclear tests that year .
Thus started the French moratorium on nuclear tests which was renewed several times , finally to be suspended by the new French President , Jacques Chirac , in 1995 .
On 13th June 1995 , as President of the French Republic , Mr. Chirac announced the resumption of nuclear tests by France ; this was to be a final series of eight tests between September 1995 and May 1996 .
The French President announced simultaneously that France would carry out a final campaign of nuclear testing in the Pacific and that it would sign a universal and verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) .
The last French nuclear test took place on January 27 , 1996 .
In March 1996 , France signed the protocols of the Rarotonga Treaty , establishing a nuclear - free zone in the South Pacific .
By adhering to the Rarotonga Treaty , France definitively gave up using the CEP for its intended mission .
France did not await the signing of the CTBT to begin dismantling facilities specifically linked to nuclear experimentation .
Substitute activities -- both civilian and military -- were sought .
None were found to be viable , essentially because of the prohibitive cost of operations at the atolls due to their distance from Tahiti , their isolation in the middle of the Pacific and the absence of natural resources ( fresh water in particular ) .
It was therefore decided to return the atolls to their intitial wild state .
Prior to the creation of the EP , Mururoa and Fangataufa were indeed completely uninhabited .
Leaving equipment or buildings in place without a specific use would have been incompatible with properly ensuring the safety of the people on the sites .
Indeed , the climatic conditions and salt air quickly lead to the deterioration of anything that is not maintained .
Following aerial experiments , the necessary restoration and decontamination work was carried out , placing all above - water sections of the atolls in compliance with public access standards .
Access restrictions that may remain in place in certain areas are due solely to the dangers posed by possible poor weather conditions .
After the end of underground tests , well heads were plugged , guaranteeing that the products of nuclear explosions would remain totally contained over the long - term .
No restoration or decontamination was necessary following this type of test .
Depending on their nature , the materials and equipment used at the CEP met with different fates .
At the CEP , the Atomic Energy Commission used equipment that was specific to the performance of tests .
Barges and drilling equipment were sold to private companies after being checked for radiation ; these will be used for prospecting in Australia .
Measuring equipment , consisting of various instruments and computer systems , were returned to France .
As for surveillance equipment , it wil be kept on site for use in long - term geological and radiological surveys .
Military equipment rendered useless ( ships , helicopters ) was returned to the army , which was in charge of operating it for the CEP .
All other conventional materials and equipment were evaluated according to how well they were preserved and how well they satisfied standards of use .
Whatever was in need of repair or did not meet security standards or the standards of use defined by labor legislation was destroyed at the site .
Facilities that still satisfy a need may be reused , particularly in Hao ; this is the case , for example with the freshwater production system .
Indeed , the State has decided to maintain and even to strengthen its presence in Hao with the assignment there of the 5th Foreign Regiment , which will continue to carry out important work for Polynesia ( landing strips , roads , etc . )
Other facilities and equipment that have little residual value given the cost of transport and reassembly at a different site will be destroyed .
Very low - activity wastes consist of such items as tools used for boring to determine radiochemical measurements after nuclear tests .
They are processed and placed in deep wells , comparable to those used for the tests .
The waste is thus safely contained for the long term in a manner identical to that of residue from nuclear explosions .
The territorial deliberation of 1964 ceding the atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa to France called for their return in the event of the cessation of activities by the CEP .
However , the halt of nuclear tests does not mean the end of all activities on the sites in the immediate term , as surveillance of the atolls is necessary .
Surveillance of the sites remains the responsibility of the defense forces , implying the presence of legionnaires and an ongoing military status for these atolls for the necessary duration .
Future geological surveillance of the atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa will be carried out through an automated system ( TELSITE ) focusing essentially on Mururoa and involving periodic obeservation campaigns coupled with radiological surveillance campaigns .
Ambient radioactivity in the air and water will also be monitored by an automated station .
These continuous measures will be supplemented by annual campaigns which will take samples from the physical environment ( air , soil , water , sediment ) and the biological domain ( plants , fish , plankton , shellfish ) .
This surveillance program may be modified to take into account recommendations made by the international scientific mission under the aegis of the IAEA .

" Do you remember Tsar Nikolai 's era ?
When the Red Army came and when Vladimir Lenin died ?
Well I do .
So take a guess how old I am . "
Meet Sohan Dosova - the newly found treasure of Kazakhstan .
She is 130 years old , at least she is according to her documents .
The Soviet passport issued in the early 1980s states that Sohan Dosova was born in the Karaganda region on 27 March 1879 .
Now after a new national census in Kazakhstan , she has been " rediscovered " .
" This is a truly unique case , " says Ludmila Kolesova , the head of Karaganda region statistics agency .
" According to international standards we do not usually seek proof of ID when collecting census data , but when it came to Sohan Dosova we had to check her documents and verify this information with the social services department .
They confirmed her date of birth . "
Tea with butter Sohan Dosova can still walk , albeit with great care , assisted by a walking stick .
She eats slowly , and her favourite snack is bread soaked in tea .
Sohan chews her food with a single remaining tooth .
Sohan says she can no longer dance , but she enjoys singing " My secret is to add butter to my cup of tea ; this is how Kazakhs like their tea , " says Sohan , speaking a mixture of Kazakh and Russian .
She can still see , but has hearing problems , so most of the communication is done via her granddaughters - and there is no shortage of them .
Sohan had 10 children , and three of them are still alive .
Her son had seven children .
One of two daughters had six children , and the other , 22 .
" There is a small tribe of great - grandchildren , " says 53 - year - old Gulgoim , her eldest granddaughter .
But when pressed , Gulgoim was unable to say just how many .
Sohan Dosova has lived her entire life in Aul , a village in the central Karaganda region , the industrial heart of the country .
Most of the population work in the coal mining industry .
Semipalatinsk , the first Soviet nuclear test site , is nearby .
Some of Sohan 's grandchildren are mentally ill .
They are among thousands believed to have been victims of Soviet nuclear experiments .
But Sohan has stayed healthy .
" She is in good shape , alert and active , " says Valentina Shamardina , a family doctor with 40 years experience .
" In my whole career I never came across cases like this .
When I first arrived to do a check - up I demanded to see her passport and it all looked correct .
" I 've never heard of anyone living that long . "
Frequent visitors
If Mrs Dosova really is 130 years old , that would make her the oldest person in the world .
But if she ever had a birth certificate , it no longer exists .
A Soviet passport issued in the early 1980s makes Sohan Dosova 130
In fact few rural Kazakhs born in those days are likely to have been registered .
It was common for people to make up their date of birth .
Her true age is simply impossible to establish .
But the local media is satisfied she 's the oldest woman in Kazakhstan .
Since the results of the census were made public , journalists have become frequent visitors to Sohan 's fifth floor apartment .
" This place is small , I need a bigger flat , " says Sohan .
" There are too many people living in this crowded apartment , there is not enough room . "
Certainly her family appear to be hopeful that all the media attention might result in an improvement to Sohan 's living conditions .
But up to now , no benefactor has been forthcoming .
So Sohan continues to live a simple existence in her old age , watching television , laughing and smiling .
Her granddaughter Nuken claims she loves dancing , but Sohan says she is too old for that now .
" I can't dance , my knees hurt ...
But I can sing . "
And so she gives a gruff rendition of her favourite Kazakh song .

Well , we knew that the fake controversy over the Department of Homeland Security 's domestic - terrorism report was really all about whipping up paranoia among the Republicans ' right - wing - populist footsoldiers .
But we really did n't expect their leading officials and pundits , like Michael Steele and Sean Hannity , to be hearing the black helicopters whupping overhead already :
Steele :
You know , they 've got their eye on the 3,000 Americans who assembled in Indiana last night , in Evansville , Indiana , to profess their continued effort to save the life of the unborn .
Sarah Palin and myself and 3,000 other Americans who 're concerned about the life issue were gathered there .
And I 'm sure there was somebody in the room with a notepad and a camera taking snapshots and writing down names .
Of course , Steele is just doing his part .
The more paranoiac , the merrier .
I 'm realizing why so many people at the Seattle Tea Tantrum were looking at me so suspiciously .
It was n't that they thought I might be liberal ; it was that they thought I was a DHS agent .
Boston Globe shutdown averted for now
Unions signal readiness to accept massive concessions
By Kate Randall
6 May 2009
This article is also available as a PDF to download and distribute .
The New York Times Co. , owner of the Boston Globe , announced Monday that it was tentatively withdrawing its threat to shut down the newspaper .
While tentative deals have been reached with six of the paper ’s unions , there is still no agreement with the largest union — the Boston Newspaper Guild ( BNG ) .
Following a marathon bargaining session over the weekend and after a midnight Sunday deadline passed without an agreement with the BNG , the Times Co. announced it would file the required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification law that would have set into motion plans to shut down the paper within 60 days .
The Times Co. ’s back - off from the closure threat came as all the unions representing Globe employees , including the BNG , indicated their readiness to accept massive concessions .
Last month , the Globe ’s owners demanded the unions agree to $ 20 million in concessions by May 1 — half of this from the BNG — or the paper would be shuttered .
Globe spokesman Robert Powers seemed confident that additional concessions would be extracted from the BNG negotiating committee , commenting Monday , “ We expect to achieve both the workplace flexibility , and the financial savings that we sought from these unions . ”
Negotiations between the Guild and management were set to resume at 5 p.m. Tuesday .
BNG leaders have offered givebacks from their members amounting to more than $ 10 million , but negotiations are reportedly stalled over lifetime job guarantees for 170 of the Guild ’s 660 journalists , advertising and business office employees received in exchange for previous contract concessions .
About 435 Globe workers in various unions are protected by the lifetime guarantees .
The concessions offered by the BNG leadership include , among others , the following :
• Workweek to increase to 40 hours from 37.5 hours ( $ 2,507,488 )
• A 3.5 percent wage cut for most Guild members ( $ 1,278,236 )
• Early retirement age to be raised from 52 to 55 ( $ 1,000,000 )
• Pension accrual reductions ( $ 1,000,000 )
• Health care to be eliminated for retirees 65 years and up ( $ 995,400 )
• A 1.3 percent furlough for all employees ( $ 659,750 ) — to sunset at contract ’s end
• Elimination of Co-op and summer intern positions ( $ 452,563 )
• Elimination of the 401 ( a ) retirement plan ( $ 450,000 )
These draconian concessions , however , were considered inadequate by the Times Co. , which is intent on eliminating the lifetime job guarantees .
Under the BNG ’s contract provisions , management can invoke an emergency clause sending the issue to a third - party arbitrator , which would require the Globe to open its financial records for review .
The six unions representing press operators , delivery truck drivers , mailers and other workers have all reached tentative agreements .
The Teamsters union , representing 245 mailers , has offered $ 5 million in concessions , as well as changes to the lifetime job guarantees for some of their members .
The union representing 210 truck drivers has agreed to $ 2.5 million in cutbacks .
All of these deals — including any future agreement with the Boston Newspaper Guild — must be approved by membership votes .
The WSWS spoke with one Globe worker with over 30 years seniority , who is presently protected by the lifetime job guarantee .
Commenting on the wide - ranging concessions on wages , healthcare , seniority , vacation time and benefits that the Guild would soon present to its membership , he said , “ This is capitulation .
We have a contract until the end of the year and there is no need to reopen it . ”
The worker also pointed out that the separate agreement for lifetime contracts could , according to the contract language , be forced to mandatory renegotiation if the Globe were in danger of closing .
The Guild has refused to reopen negotiations on this issue , but the Times Co. has not forced the issue .
“ That ’s because they ’d have to open their books to the NLRB .
The threat to close the plant is nothing but a scare tactic to stampede us into taking massive concessions . ”
He noted that the Globe is in the process of moving millions of dollars worth of equipment from its recently closed Billerica , Mass .
facility to the Boston plant , and is installing a new half - million - dollar freight elevator .
“ I think they want to sell the place and drive down the price of labor to make it attractive to a buyer , ” he said .
The worker continued , “ People say that anything is better than unemployment , but I do n’t think so , and I have 30 years in this place .
It ’s better than humiliation . ”
When a WSWS reporter suggested that the working class needed a new leadership , independent of the unions , the worker said , “ We ’ve needed that for years now , but who ’s going to step forward ? ”
State of the US newspaper industry
The Boston Globe , founded in 1872 , was purchased by the New York Times Co. in 1993 from Affiliated Publications for $ 1.1 billion , the highest price ever paid for a US newspaper .
With a weekday circulation of 303,000 , the Globe is the most widely read daily paper throughout New England .
It has , however , seen a 14 percent drop in circulation in the latest six - month period alone .
In 2008 , the paper ’s weekday circulation fell by 8.3 percent to 350,605 , down from 382,503 the previous year .
The Times Co. says that the Globe lost $ 50 million in 2008 and will lose another $ 85 million if they do not extract the $ 20 million in concessions from Globe employees .
The Globe has been among the worst hit of US newspapers by a decline in classified advertising revenue , particularly due to the crisis in the real estate market .
It has also suffered a loss of readership to its online edition , particularly among younger readers .
The deepening recession , combined with rising newspaper prices , has also resulted in increasing numbers of people dropping home deliveries across the country .
A report by the Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism , “ The State of the News Media 2009 , ” found that newspaper circulation fell nationwide by 4.6 percent daily and 4.8 percent on Sundays last year .
Total US newspaper ad revenue fell by 16 percent in 2008 , to $ 38 billion , and is down 23 percent from just two years ago .
Ads on newspapers ’ online editions have not delivered as expected , falling 0.4 percent in 2008 and amounting to less than 10 percent of total ad revenue .
The print editions of the Rocky Mountain News in Denver , Colorado , and the Seattle Post - Intelligencer ( Washington state ) shut down in 2009 .
Other newspapers , including the Detroit News / Free Press , have cut back their delivery days .
Last November , the Christian Science Monitor announced it would publish online - only , except for a magazine - style weekend print edition .
The Pew study estimates that about 5,000 full - time newsroom jobs were lost in 2008 , or about 10 percent of the total .
Overseas and Washington , DC bureaus have been particularly hard - hit , with half of US states no longer having a newspaper with a DC - based staff .
Similar to the situation at the Boston Globe , management at several large dailies — the Seattle Times , Denver Post and San Francisco Chronicle — have threatened bankruptcy or closure if workers do not submit to drastic concessions .
Journalists , editorial staff , pressmen , mailers , truck drivers and other workers at the Globe are not responsible for the present situation they confront .
The crisis in the newspaper industry is an indictment of the profit system itself , under conditions where the global position of American capitalism has dramatically deteriorated .
Management at the News York Times Co. and at other newspapers , like their counterparts in other branches of industry , are demanding that Globe workers grant massive concessions , and submit to brutal levels of exploitation , because profits extracted through the paper ’s publication are sinking .
It should be noted that top executives at the Globe and the Times Co. continue to rake in multi-million - dollar compensation packages — in salaries , stock options and other perks .
The response of the unions representing workers at the Globe to management ’s demands has been to offer them every penny of the $ 20 million they have asked for and more .
As in other industries , these organizations have long since made their peace with the capitalist system , and function not as instruments of struggle to defend workers ’ interests , but as an integral component of the corporate onslaught on the working class .
The Boston Newspaper Guild stated Monday : “ We are committed to negotiating this matter until an agreement is reached that we can bring to Guild members for a vote . ”
In other words , they are committed to conspiring with management to hash out an agreement slashing wages , benefits and jobs that they will then seek to ram through in a membership vote .
A struggle to defend jobs and conditions at the Boston Globe , and to stop the shutdown of the paper , requires a break with these old organizations and the building of independent rank - and - file workplace committees .
New forms of struggle — including mass demonstrations , strikes , and occupations — are required .
Such a struggle must be guided by a new political strategy , based on a socialist program , which bases itself on the interests of working people — not the profits of big business .
As a first step in this fight , Globe workers should reject the contracts negotiated by union leaders at their upcoming ratification meetings .

Demands $ 20 million in concessions from unions by May 1
[ 10 April 2009 ]
The 2003 invasion of Iraq was sold to the public at the time as being justified in part by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein ’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and his harboring of al Qaeda terrorists .
In the wake of the Bush Administration ’s 2003 invasion of Iraq , word leaked out that several prominent figures around Bush long had wanted to invade Iraq ; for them , 9/11 was the perfect cover , and the WMD and al Qaeda arguments mere window dressing .
By the time the world knew the justifications were false , Iraq had been conquered and Saddam had been removed .
President - elect Barack Obama now says that he is going to reverse the current course of the US economy .
This contraction , largely the result of the popping of the Fed - induced housing bubble , would come to a natural end in a matter of months anyway .
That ’s how the market works : if there is a government - induced binge , the fever breaks and the patient can return to health .
But the average American has been brought up to believe that good economic times are the results of proper government policy , and that bad times result from its absence .
Like some 18th - century physician with a bag full of leeches , knives , glasses , purgatives , and emetics to leach , bleed , burn , and blister a sick man before inducing diarrhea and making him vomit , government hovers over the American economy , eager to make him sick in the name of restoring his health .
We have seen the same scenario play out many times in American history .
The finest medical care available in America killed poor George Washington in 1799 , and the latest economic voodoo caused the recession of 1929 to last a decade and one - half .
When finally the government laid off the taxpayer and the business owner in 1945 , the US economy boomed .
What a remarkable example of statesmanship !
The lesson historians drew was that not only was Franklin Roosevelt , the bleeder and blisterer who had stretched the previous recession to seven times the normal length of an American recession , a great statesman , but so was Harry Truman !
Barack Obama , it seems , wants to be judged in the same way .
His soon - to - be- predecessor , George W. Bush , has emulated Herbert Hoover in responding to the current contraction with a spate of inapt federal measures : nearly $ 1,000,000,000,000 in handouts of newly - printed dollars to US banks and insurance companies have yielded no discernable result .
In fact , federal " oversight " appears to have been totally absent , as the same inept colossi whose institutions tottered on the brink of insolvency before this great looting of the taxpayer now claim not to know where the money went .
What to make of this ?
Why , that more of it is " needed , " of course .
Thus , $ 17,000,000,000 was handed over by Bush and his minions to insolvent American automobile manufacturers .
No moral , philosophical , or constitutional justification of handing , say , GM — with a current value of — $ 60B ( that is , negative sixty billion dollars ) — a few billion was even attempted .
No one said how this " loan " would make the great Midwestern dinosaur solvent .
Why not ?
My prognostication ?
Because it wo n’t .
All this " act of statesmanship " has done is keep GM in business so that GM can demand more money from the government in a few months .
And more a few months after that .
And more a few months after that .
The calculations here are almost entirely those of brute politics .
GM is " too big to fail . "
That is , its unions control so many votes that they , like plains - state senators demanding agricultural subsidies , can twist this gift out of the taxpayer .
Comes word now that the steel companies are lining up at the trough .
Surely the paleoconservatives will muster the same arguments in their favor as served so well in the case of the Big Three : great countries manufacture their own steel ; steel workers are highly paid ; some of them were navy SEALs ; my sister does n’t want her husband to lose his job at the steel plant ; and ( the only one that really matters ) if the Republicans do n’t join the Democrats in this measure , highly organized and politically mobilized steel workers will vote Democratic forevermore .
I predicted that the Big Three would get our money .
I predict that other decrepit industries will follow .
AIG spent part of its federal gift on lavish retreats for senior executives .
Chrysler put some of its taxpayer " loan " into advertising to " thank " taxpayers .
This obscenity was rather akin to Stalin " thanking " the kulaks for their land .
Barack Obama just announced that he plans to have the federal government resolve the economic problem in part by " modernizing " libraries and offering tax reductions to " workers . "
The library gambit is all about pork - barrel politics : every substantial community has a library , and so a measure like that will mean a federal expenditure in every congressman ’s district .
Since the early nineteenth - century days of Henry Clay ( Pat Buchanan ’s hero ) , greasing the skids that way has been part of the art of buying votes .
No need to explain how expropriating money from its owner to purchase a new rug or computer for a library helps the economy .
Tax reductions to " workers , " in classic Keynesian analysis , are a wonderful way to address economic contraction because " workers " ( that is , unskilled employees ) tend to spend a higher proportion of their income than the more affluent .
Obama ’s conclusion , then , is that America , with virtually the world ’s lowest rate of savings , suffers at present from too much savings and too little spending .
He wants to reduce the savings rate even further .
This is what Keynesianism has given us : gigantic debt and ever - declining savings , despite the fact that everyone knows that societal investment ( read : savings ) is necessary to heighten the future standard of living .
The Clay platform was based chiefly on the idea of " internal improvements , " meaning federal financing of roads and bridges throughout the country .
Again , if roads were built throughout the country with money provided by the Federal Government , locals would see the wonderful benefit of supporting Henry Clay .
Obama understands this perfectly well .
Like the Feiths and Abramses , the Cheneys and Wolfowitzes , and like George W. Bush himself wanting war with Iraq and seizing on the first excuse that came to hand , Obama has been handed a perfect cover for doing what he was disposed to do all along .
An orgy of public spending outstripping even the super - profligate Bush ’s was the desire of the leftward - most senator before the contraction , and he can justify it with economic bunk now .
As CNN.com reports , “ Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we do n’t act swiftly and boldly , we could see a much deeper economic downturn , ” Obama said .
“ That ’s why we need an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that not only creates jobs in the short - term but spurs economic growth and competitiveness in the long - term . ”
But " economists from across the political spectrum " do not " agree . "
Keynesians and Chicago School monetarists who slathered credit for the bubble on Allan Greenspan and failed to predict its popping , which they still find inexplicable , agree .
Austrian School economists who castigated Greenspan during the bubble , forecast the current contraction , and see worse to come as a result of the government ’s response , disagree .
Vehemently .
Buy this book
But , as one of the Austrians recently said , " Being right is overrated . "
They are now in the position of the bystander who cannot reach the child in time to push him out of the way of the bus .
Obama has adopted Bill Clinton ’s tactic of referring to all government spending as " investment , " but his taxing and borrowing to pay for wasteful government programs will only make matters worse .
The American economy is like big , healthy George Washington that fateful day in 1799 .
How much quackery will the government inflict ?
Reduced saving means reduced future standard of living .
Heightened government spending means reduced saving .
Taking money from the politically weak to give it to the strong is King John ’s model of government .
And George Bush ’s .
And Barack Obama’s .
In recent days , some paleoconservatives have labeled observations such as these " ideological , " people who object to the Big Three Rip - off " ideologues . "
Was Robin Hood an " ideologue " ?
Was King John a " statesman " ?
There is still time for Obama to decide that unlike the second Bush , he is not going to follow King John in taking money from everyone else for the benefit of the well connected .
He can still refuse to follow Bush in exploiting others ’ misery for his own ideological ends .
The signs are not promising .

The annual Linux kernel summit may gain the most attention , but the size of the kernel community makes it hard to get deeply into subsystem - specific topics at that event .
So , increasingly , kernel developers gather for more focused events where some real work can be done .
One of those gatherings is the Linux Storage and Filesystem workshop ; the 2009 workshop began on April 6 .
Here is your editor 's summary of the discussions which took place on the first day .
Things began with a quick recap of the action items from the previous year .
Some of these had been fairly well resolved over that time ; these include power management , support for object storage devices , fibre channel over Ethernet , barriers on by default in ext4 , the fallocate ( ) system call , and enabling relatime by default .
The record for some other objectives is not quite so good ; low - level error handling is still not what it could be , " too much work " has been done with I/ O bandwidth controllers while nothing has made it upstream , the union filesystem problem has not been solved , etc .
As a whole , a lot has been done , but a lot remains to do .
Device discovery
Joel Becker and Kay Sievers led a session on device discovery .
On a contemporary system , device numbers are not stable across reboots , and neither are device names .
So anything in the system which must work with block devices and filesystems must somehow find the relevant device first .
Currently , that is being done by scanning through all of the devices on the system .
That works reasonably well on a laptop , but it is a real problem on systems with huge numbers of block devices .
There are stories of large systems taking hours to boot , with the bulk of that time being spent scanning ( repeatedly - once for every mount request ) through known devices .
What comes out of the discussion , of course , is that user space needs a better way to locate devices .
A given program may be searching for a specific filesystem label , UUID , or something else ; a good search API would support all of these modes and more .
What would be best would be to build some sort of database where each new device is added at discovery time .
As additional information becomes available ( when a filesystem label is found , for example ) , it is added to the database .
Then , when a specific search is done , the information has already been gathered and a scan of the system 's devices is no longer necessary .
In the simplest form , this database can be the various directories full of symbolic links that udev creates now .
These directories solve much of the problem , but they can never be a complete solution for one reason : some types of devices - iSCSI targets , for example - do not really exist for the system until user space has connected to them .
Multipath devices also throw a spanner into that works .
For this reason , Ted Ts'o asserted that some sort of programmatic API will always be needed .
Not a lot of progress was made toward specifying a solution ; the main concern , seemingly , was coming to a common understanding of the problem .
What 's likely to happen is that the libblkid library will be extended to provide the needed functionality .
Next year , we 'll see if that has been done .
Asynchronous and direct I/
O
Zach Brown 's stated purpose in this session was to " just rant for 45 minutes " about the poor state of asynchronous I/O ( AIO ) support in Linux .
After ten years , he says , we still have an inadequate system which has never been fixed .
The problems with Linux AIO are well documented : only a few operations are truly asynchronous , the internal API is terrible , it does not properly support the POSIX AIO API , etc .
There , Zach says , are people wanting to do a lot more with AIO than is currently supported by Linux .
That said , various alternatives have been proposed over time but nobody ever tests them .
The conversation then shifted for a bit ; Jeff Moyer took a turn to complain about the related topic of direct I/O .
It works poorly for applications , he says , its semantics are different for different filesystems , the internal I / O paths for direct I/O are completely different from those used for buffered I/O , and it is full of races and corner cases .
Not a pretty picture .
One of the biggest complications with direct I/O is the need for the system to support simultaneous direct and buffered I /O on the same file .
Prohibiting that combination would simplify the problem considerably , but that is a hard thing to do .
In particular , it would tend to break backups , which often want to read ( in buffered mode ) a file which is open for direct I/O .
There was some talk of adding a new O_REALLYDIRECT mode which would lock out buffered operations , but it 's not clear that the advantages would make this change worthwhile .
Another thing that would help with direct I/O would be to remove the alignment restrictions on I /O buffers .
That 's a hard change to make , though ; many disk controllers can only perform DMA to properly - aligned buffers .
So allowing unaligned buffers would force the kernel to copy data internally , which rather defeats the purpose of direct I /O .
There is one use case , though , where direct I / O might still make sense : some direct I / O users really only want to avoid filling the system page cache with their data .
Using the fadvise ( ) system call is arguably a better way of achieving that goal , but application developers are said to distrust it .
All told , it seems from the discussion that there is not a whole lot to be done to improve direct I/O on Linux .
Returning to the AIO problem , the developers discussed Zach 's proposed acall ( ) API , which shifts blocking operations into special - purpose kernel threads .
The use of threads in this manner promises a better AIO implementation than Linux has ever had in the past .
But there is a cost : some core scheduler changes need to be made to support acall ( ) .
Among other things , there are some complexities related to transferring credentials between threads , propagating signals from AIO threads back to the original process , etc .
The end result is that scheduler performance may well suffer slightly .
The scheduler developers tend to be sensitive to even very small performance penalties , so there may well be pushback when acall ( ) is proposed for mainline inclusion .
The addition of acall ( ) would also add a certain maintenance burden .
Whenever a kernel developer makes a change to the task structure , that developer would have to think about whether the change is relevant to acall ( ) and whether it would need to be transferred to or from worker threads .
The conclusion was that acall ( ) looks promising , and that the developers in the room thought that it could work .
They also agreed , though , that a number of the relevant people were not in the room , so the question of whether acall ( ) is appropriate for the kernel as a whole could not be answered .
RAID unification
The kernel currently contains two software RAID implementations , found in the MD and device mapper ( DM ) subsystems .
Additionally , the Btrfs filesystem is gaining RAID capabilities of its own , a process which is expected to continue in the future .
It is generally agreed that having three ( or more ) versions of RAID in the kernel is not an optimal situation .
What a proper solution will look like , though , is not all that clear .
The session on RAID unification started with this question : who thinks that block subsystem development should be happening in the device mapper layer ?
A single hand was raised .
In general , it seems , the developers in the room had a relatively low opinion of the device mapper RAID code .
It should be said , of course , that there were no DM developers present .
What it comes down to is that the next generation of filesystems wants to include multiple device support .
Plans for Btrfs include eventual RAID 6 support , but Btrfs developer Chris Mason has no interest in writing that code .
It would be much nicer to use a generic RAID layer provided by the kernel .
There are challenges , though .
For example , a RAID - aware filesystem really wants to use different stripe sizes for data and metadata .
Standard RAID , which knows little about the filesystems built on it , does not provide any such feature .
So what would a filesystem RAID API look like ?
Christoph Hellwig is working on this problem , but he 's not ready to deal with the filesystem problem yet .
Instead , he 's going to start by figuring out how to unify the MD and DM RAID code .
Some of this work may involve creating a set of tables in the block layer for mapping specific regions of a virtual device onto real regions in a lower - level device .
The block layer already does that - it's how partitions work - but incorporating RAID would complicate things considerably .
But , once that 's done , we 'll be a lot closer to having a general - purpose RAID layer which can be used by multiple callers .
The talk wandered into the area of error handling for a while .
In particular , the tools Linux provides to administrators to deal with bad blocks are still not what they could be .
There was talk about providing a consistent interface for reporting bad blocks - including tools for mapping those blocks back to the files that contain them - as well as performing passive scanning for bad blocks .
The action items that came out of this discussion include the rework of in - kernel RAID by Christoph .
After that , the process of trying to define filesystem - specific interfaces will begin .
Rename , fsync , and ponies
Prior to Ted Ts'o 's session on fsync ( ) and rename ( ) , some joker filled the room with coloring - book pages depicting ponies .
These pages reflected the sentiment that Ted has often expressed : application developers are asking too much of the filesystem , so they might as well request a pony while they 're at it .
Ted apologized to the room for his part in the implementation of the data=ordered mode for ext3 .
This mode was added as a way to improve the security of the filesystem , but it had the side effect of flushing many changes to the filesystem within a five - second window .
That allowed application developers to " get lazy " and stop worrying about whether their data had actually hit the disk at the right times .
Now those developers are resisting the idea that they should begin to worry again .
This problem has a longer history than many people realize .
The XFS filesystem first hit it back around 2001 .
But ,
Ted says , most application developers did n't understand why they were getting corrupted files after a crash .
Rather than fix their applications , they just switched filesystems - to ext3 .
Things worked for some time until Ubuntu users started testing the alpha " Jaunty " release , which uses ext4 by default makes ext4 available as an installation option .
At that point , they started finding zero - length files after crashes , and they blamed ext4 .
But , Ted says , the real problem is the missing fsync ( ) calls .
There are a number of reasons why they are not there , including developer laziness , the problem that fsync ( ) on ext3 has become very expensive , the difficulty involved in preserving access control lists and other extended attributes when creating new files , and concerns about the battery - life costs of forcing the disk to spin up .
Ted had more sympathy for some of these reasons than others , but , he says , " the application developers outnumber us , " so something will have to be done to meet their concerns .
Valerie Aurora broke in to point out that application developers have been put into a position where they cannot do the right thing .
A call to fsync ( ) can stall the system for quite a while on ext3 .
Users do n't like that either ; witness the fuss caused by excessive use of fsync ( ) by the Firefox browser .
So it 's not just that application developers are lazy ; there are real disincentives to the use of fsync ( ) .
Ted agreed , but he also claimed that a lot of application developers are refusing to help fix the problem .
In the short term , the ext4 filesystem has gained a number of workarounds to help prevent the worst surprises .
If a newly - written file is renamed on top of another , existing file , its data will be flushed to disk with the next commit .
Similar things happen with files which have been truncated and rewritten .
There is a performance cost to these changes , but they do make a significant part of the problem go away .
For the longer term , Ted asked : should the above - described fixes become a part of the filesystem policy for Linux ?
In other words , should application developers be assured that they 'll be able to write a file , rename it on top of another file , omit fsync ( ) , and not encounter zero - length files after a crash ?
The answer turns out to be " yes , " but first Ted presented his other long - term ideas .
One of those is to improve the performance of the fsync ( ) system call .
The ext4 workarounds have also been added to ext3 when it runs in the data=writeback mode .
Additionally , some block - layer fixes have been incorporated into 2.6.30 .
With those fixes in place , it is possible to run in data=writeback mode , avoid the zero - length file problem , and also avoid the fsync ( ) performance problem .
So , Ted asked , should data=writeback be made the default for ext3 ?
This idea was received with a fair amount of discomfort .
The data=writeback mode brings back problems that were fixed by data=ordered ; after a crash , a file which was being written could turn up with completely unrelated data in it .
It could be somebody else 's sensitive data .
Even if it 's boring data , the problem looks an awful lot like file corruption to many users .
It seems like a step backward and a change which is hard to justify for a filesystem which is headed toward maintenance mode .
So it would be surprising to see this change made .
[ After writing the above , your editor noticed that Linus had just merged a change to make data=writeback the default for ext3 in 2.6.30 .
Your editor , it seems , is easily surprised . ]
Finally , the idea of the fbarrier ( ) system call was raised .
Essentially , fbarrier ( ) would ensure that any data written to a file prior to the call would be flushed to disk before any metadata changes made after the call .
It could be implemented with fsync ( ) ; for ext3 data=ordered mode , it would do nothing at all .
Ted did not try hard to sell this system call , saying that it was mainly there to address the laptop power consumption concern .
Ric
Wheeler claimed that it would be a waste of time ; by the time people are actually using it , we 'll all have solid - state drives in our laptops and the power concern will be gone .
In general , enthusiasm for fbarrier ( ) was low .
So the discussion turned back to the idea of generalizing and guaranteeing the ext4 workarounds .
Chris Mason asked when there might be a time that somebody would not want to rename files safely ; he did not get an answer .
There was concern that these workarounds could not be allowed to hurt the performance of well - written applications .
But the general sentiment was that these workarounds should become policy that all filesystems should implement .
pNFS
There was a session on supporting parallel NFS ( pNFS ) .
It was mostly a detailed , technical discussion on what sort of API is needed to allow clustered filesystems to tell pNFS about how files are distributed across servers .
Your editor will confess that his eyes glazed over after a while , and his notes are relatively incoherent .
Suffice to say that , eventually , OCFS2 and GFS will be able to communicate with pNFS servers and that all the people who really care about how that works will understand it .
Miscellaneous topics
The final session of the day related to " miscellaneous VFS topics " ; the first had to do with eCryptfs .
This filesystem provides encryption for individual files ; it is currently implemented as a stacking filesystem using an ordinary filesystem to provide the real storage .
The stacking nature of eCryptfs has long been a problem ; now some Ubuntu developers are working to change it .
In particular , what they would like to do is to move the encryption handling directly into the VFS layer .
Somehow users will supply a key to the kernel , which will then transparently handle the encryption and decryption of data .
To that end , some sort of transformation layer will be provided to process the data between the page cache and the underlying block device .
One question that came up was : what happens when the user does not have a valid key ?
Should the VFS just provide encrypted data in that case ?
Al Viro raised the question of what happens when one process opens the file with a key while another one opens it without a key .
At that point there will be a mixture of encrypted and clear - text pages in the cache , a situation which seems sure to lead to confusion .
So it seems that the VFS will simply refuse to provide access to files if the necessary key is not provided .
There are various problems to be solved in the creation of the transformation layer - things like not letting processes modify a page while it is being encrypted or decrypted .
Chris Mason noted that he faces a similar problem when generating checksums for pages in Btrfs .
These are problems which can be addressed , though .
But it was clear that this kind of transformation is likely to be built into the VFS in the future .
Stacking filesystems just do not work well with the Linux VFS as it exists now .
Next up was David Brown , who works in the scientific high - performance computing field .
David has an interesting problem .
He runs massive systems with large storage arrays spread out across many systems .
Whenever some process calls stat ( ) on a file stored in that array , the entire cluster essentially has to come to a stop .
Locks have to be acquired , cached pages have to be flushed out , etc. , just to ensure that specific metadata ( the file size in particular ) is available and correct .
So , if a scientist logs in and types " ls " in a large directory , the result can be 30 minutes in coming and little work gets done in the mean time .
Not ideal .
What David would like is a " stat ( ) light " call which would n't cause all of this trouble .
It should return the metadata to the best of its knowledge , but it would not flush caches or take cluster - wide locks to obtain this information .
If that means that the size is not entirely accurate , so be it .
In the subsequent discussion , the idea was modified a little bit .
" Slightly inaccurate " results would not be returned ; instead , the size would simply be zeroed out .
It was felt that returning no information at all was better than returning something which may have no real basis in reality .
Beyond that , there would likely be a mask associated with the system call .
Initially it was suggested that the mask would be returned ; it would have bits set to indicate which fields in the return stat structure are valid .
But it was also suggested that the mask should be an input parameter instead ; the call would then do whatever was needed to provide the fields requested by the caller .
Using the mask as an input parameter would avoid the need for duplicate calls in the case where the necessary information is not provided the first time around .
The actual form of the system call is likely to be determined when somebody follows Christoph Hellwig 's advice to " send a bloody patch . "
The final topic of the day was union mounts .
Valerie Aurora , who led this session , recently wrote an article about union filesystems and the associated problems for LWN .
The focus of this session was the readdir ( ) system call in particular .
POSIX requires that readdir ( ) provide a position within a directory which can be used by the application at any future time to return to the same spot and resume reading directory entries .
This requirement is hard for any contemporary filesystem to meet .
It becomes almost impossible for union filesystems , which , by definition , are presenting a combination of at least two other filesystems .
The solution that Valerie was proposing was to simply recreate directories in the top ( writable ) layer of the union .
The new directories would point to files in the appropriate places within the union and would have whiteouts applied .
That would eliminate the need to mix together directory entries from multiple layers later on , and the readdir ( ) problem would collapse back to the single - filesystem implementation .
At least , that holds true for as long as none of the lower - level filesystems in the union change .
Valerie proposes that these filesystems be forced to be read - only , with an unmount required before they could be changed .
The good news is that this is how BSD union mounts have worked for a long time .
The bad news is that there 's one associated problem : inode number stability .
NFS servers are expected to provide stable inode numbers to clients even across reboots .
But copying a file entry up to the top level of a union will change its inode number , confusing NFS clients .
One possible solution to this problem is to simply decree that union mounts cannot be exported via NFS .
It 's not clear that there is a plausible use case for this kind of export in any case .
The other solution is to just let the inode number change .
That could lead to different NFS clients having open file descriptors to different versions of the file , but so be it .
The consensus seemed to lean toward the latter solution .
And that is where the workshop concluded .
Your editor will be attending most of the second and final day ( minus a brief absence for a cameo appearance at the Embedded Linux Conference ) ; a report from that day will be posted shortly thereafter .

A protester has thrown a shoe at Wen Jiabao during a speech at Cambridge University and called the Chinese prime minister a " dictator " .
The shoe landed about a metre away from Mr Wen and the protester , a young man , was then removed by security guards .
Mr Wen , who earlier signed a series of trade agreements with Gordon Brown on the final day of a three - day UK visit , described the incident as " despicable " .
Protests have taken place about human rights and Tibet during his visit .
Protests
Five people were arrested in London on Sunday after trying to approach Mr Wen .
According to eye - witnesses , Mr Wen was interrupted near the end of a speech he was giving in Cambridge on the global economy .
According to the Press Association , the shoe was thrown from the back of the hall and landed " well away " from Mr Wen .
Reports said the protester urged the audience to challenge the Chinese prime minister , shouting " how can the university prostitute itself with this dictator ? "
Mr Wen has faced protests throughout his UK visit AFP reported that fellow members of the audience shouted " shame on you " as he was escorted out of the auditorium .
Police later confirmed that the man had been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence .
As Mr Wen arrived to deliver the speech , he was met by both pro-Chinese supporters and people demonstrating against China 's human rights record in its own country and in Tibet .
The incident was similar to an event in December when US President George W Bush was forced to duck to avoid shoes thrown at him during a visit to Iraq .
' Determination ' Earlier , Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for greater collaboration on trade between the UK and China during talks with Mr Wen at Downing Street .
Mr Brown said they shared a determination to reverse the economic downturn and Mr Wen said " concerted efforts " were needed to " address the common challenges that we face " .
Mr Wen said the economic crisis showed the " dangers of a totally unregulated market " .
He added : " Only by working together , only by making a concerted effort , can we address the common challenges we face . "
Mr Brown said the 4 trillion yuan ( £ 400 bn ) fiscal stimulus announced by the Beijing authorities in November would help British exports to China , particularly in low - carbon technologies .
" The strength of the relationship between China and Britain will be a pivotal force in helping us through the downturn and a powerful driving force behind our future growth and prosperity . "
Mr Wen met Conservative leader David Cameron for 45 minutes on Sunday to talk about topics including the economic crisis and fighting climate change .
Mr Cameron raised human rights issues with the Chinese leader and emphasised the importance of " greater participation " in Beijing 's political process .
Mr Wen 's European tour includes visits to Germany , Spain , and Brussels .

Hindsight
Josh Marshall digs up an old Enron ad , and includes his own two cents .
At last , Yahoo ( YHOO ) CEO Carol Bartz and Microsoft ( MSFT ) boss Steve Ballmer are talking about a potential search and advertising deal .
Early discussions began in the last several weeks and the two met face - to - face last week , according to AllThingsD's Kara Swisher .
The talks are " preliminary " and " wide ranging , " according to Swisher 's sources , but are not about a renewed attempt for Microsoft to buy Yahoo .
( That ship has sailed , for now at least . )
This is good news .
Microsoft needs a search deal , and if structured properly , one could benefit Yahoo as well .
Yahoo's position , while more desirable than Microsoft's , will likely only weaken to Google ( GOOG ) .
So it 's better off focusing on display advertising , while collecting cash from a search operation that Microsoft runs .
By combining , the two also offer a stronger alternative to Google for advertisers , which advertisers want -- if for any reason , to have some leverage over Google themselves .
Bartz must not make the mistake of making Microsoft a permanent partner -- let it play Microsoft and Google off each other in a few years once Yahoo is in a stronger position .
But for now , a deal with Microsoft -- again , provided it 's structured right -- is a good move .

Unfamiliar environments can be stressful for autistic children
An information guide to help adults travelling with autistic children has been produced by Manchester Airport .
Airport Awareness uses images to show what to expect on a journey from arriving to checking - in , to going through security and returning home .
Airport press officer Katy Gough created the guide after several requests by carers for airport pictures to help children plan their trip .
The guide is free and launched to coincide with World Autism Day .
The unfamiliar sights and sounds of the airport can cause stress and worry for young autistic passengers and their families , she said .
' Alien environment '
Ms Gough has personal experience of the disorder through a member of her family and wanted to help passengers whose children have Autistic Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) .
" The main problems are that the airport environment is an alien one and processes such as check - in and security require co-operation with strict guidelines , " Ms Gough said .
" However , by including chronological information in the guide about each stage of travelling through the airport and by illustrating the guide with photographs , parents are able to plan their journey with their child , helping them to understand what to expect . "
The free guide is available from the information desks , airport website and has been supplied to local autism charities and schools with special needs units .
Jane Asher , President of the National Autistic Society , said of the book : " I 'm delighted by Manchester Airport 's useful and understanding initiative .
An airport can be a very confusing place for anyone , and for someone on the autism spectrum it can be especially frightening and disorientating . "

About a year ago I went on the whole birthright trip thing .
Our tour guide Yishai was a very fun and engaging person .
Recently he posted this note on facebook and said it was alright to share … without further ado
Hi all ,
This is a letter I wrote after I came back from the war in Gaza .
Feel free to forward , comment , blog and post it .
Yishai
An Open Letter to A citizen Of Gaza :
I Am the Soldier Who Slept In Your Home :
By : Yishai G ( reserve soldier )
Hello ,
While the world watches the ruins in Gaza , you return to your home which remains standing .
However , I am sure that it is clear to you that someone was in your home while you were away .
I am that someone .
I spent long hours imagining how you would react when you walked into your home .
How you would feel when you understood that IDF soldiers had slept on your mattresses and used your blankets to keep warm .
I knew that it would make you angry and sad and that you would feel this violation of the most intimate areas of your life by those defined as your enemies , with stinging humiliation .
I am convinced that you hate me with unbridled hatred , and you do not have even the tiniest desire to hear what I have to say .
At the same time , it is important for me to say the following in the hope that there is even the minutest chance that you will hear me .
I spent many days in your home .
You and your family ’s presence was felt in every corner .
I saw your family portraits on the wall , and I thought of my family .
I saw your wife ’s perfume bottles on the bureau , and I thought of my wife .
I saw your children ’s toys and their English language schoolbooks .
I saw your personal computer and how you set up the modem and wireless phone next to the screen , just as I do .
I wanted you to know that despite the immense disorder you found in your house that was created during a search for explosives and tunnels ( which were indeed found in other homes ) , we did our best to treat your possessions with respect .
When I moved the computer table , I disconnected the cables and lay them down neatly on the floor , as I would do with my own computer .
I even covered the computer from dust with a piece of cloth .
I tried to fold the clothes that fell when we moved the closet although not the same as you would have done , but at least in such a way that nothing would get lost .
I know that the devastation , the bullet holes in your walls and the destruction of those homes near you place my descriptions in a ridiculous light .
Still , I need you to understand me , us , and hope that you will channel your anger and criticism to the right places .
I decided to write you this letter specifically because I stayed in your home .
I can surmise that you are intelligent and educated and there are those in your household that are university students .
Your children learn English , and you are connected to the Internet .
You are not ignorant ; you know what is going on around you .
Therefore , I am sure you know that Quassam rockets were launched from your neighborhood into Israeli towns and cities .
How could you see these weekly launches and not think that one day we would say “ enough ” ?!
Did you ever consider that it is perhaps wrong to launch rockets at innocent civilians trying to lead a normal life , much like you ?
How long did you think we would sit back without reacting ?
I can hear you saying “ it ’s not me , it ’s Hamas ” .
My intuition tells me you are not their most avid supporter .
If you look closely at the sad reality in which your people live , and you do not try to deceive yourself or make excuses about “ occupation ” , you must certainly reach the conclusion that the Hamas is your real enemy .
The reality is so simple , even a seven year old can understand : Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip , removing military bases and its citizens from Gush Katif .
Nonetheless , we continued to provide you with electricity , water , and goods ( and this I know very well as during my reserve duty I guarded the border crossings more than once , and witnessed hundreds of trucks full of goods entering a blockade - free Gaza every day ) .
Despite all this , for reasons that cannot be understood and with a lack of any rational logic , Hamas launched missiles on Israeli towns .
For three years we clenched our teeth and restrained ourselves .
In the end , we could not take it anymore and entered the Gaza strip , into your neighborhood , in order to remove those who want to kill us .
A reality that is painful but very easy to explain .
As soon as you agree with me that Hamas is your enemy and because of them , your people are miserable , you will also understand that the change must come from within .
I am acutely aware of the fact that what I say is easier to write than to do , but I do not see any other way .
You , who are connected to the world and concerned about your children ’s education , must lead , together with your friends , a civil uprising against Hamas .
I swear to you , that if the citizens of Gaza were busy paving roads , building schools , opening factories and cultural institutions instead of dwelling in self pity , arms smuggling and nurturing a hatred to your Israeli neighbors , your homes would not be in ruins right now .
If your leaders were not corrupt and motivated by hatred , your home would not have been harmed .
If someone would have stood up and shouted that there is no point in launching missiles on innocent civilians …
I would not have to stand in your kitchen as a soldier .
You do n’t have money , you tell me ?
You have more than you can imagine .
Even before Hamas took control of Gaza , during the time of Yasser Arafat , millions if not billions of dollars donated by the world community to the Palestinians was used for purchasing arms or taken directly to your leaders bank accounts .
Gulf States , the emirates – your brothers , your flesh and blood , are some of the richest nations in the world .
If there was just a small feeling of solidarity between Arab nations , if these nations had but the smallest interest in the reconstructing the Palestinian people – your situation would be very different .
You must be familiar with Singapore .
The land mass there is not much larger than the Gaza strip and it is considered the second most populated country in the world .
Yet , Singapore is a successful , prospering , and well managed country .
Why not the same for you ?
My friend , I would like to call you by name , but I will not do so publicly .
I want you to know that I am 100 % at peace with what my country did , what my army did , and what I did .
However , I feel your pain .
I am sorry for the destruction you are finding in your neighborhood at this moment .
On a personal level , I did what I could to minimize the damage to your home as much as possible .
In my opinion , we have a lot more in common than you might imagine .
I am a civilian , not a soldier , and in my private life I have nothing to do with the military .
However , I have an obligation to leave my home , put on a uniform , and protect my family every time we are attacked .
I have no desire to be in your home wearing a uniform again and I would be more than happy to sit with you as a guest on your beautiful balcony , drinking sweet tea seasoned with the sage growing in your garden .
The only person who could make that dream a reality is you .
Take responsibility for yourself , your family , your people , and start to take control of your destiny .
How ?
I do not know .
Maybe there is something to be learned from the Jewish people who , instead of sinking into self - pity , rose up from the most destructive human tragedy of the 20th century , and built a flourishing and prospering country .
It is possible , and it is in your hands .
I am ready to be there to provide a shoulder of support and help to you .
But only you can move the wheels of history .
Regards ,
Yishai , ( Reserve Soldier )
Before you start
This tutorial is for UNIX system developers and administrators who are looking for the best ways to troubleshoot applications running on their systems .
To get the most out of this tutorial , you should have a basic knowledge of the UNIX operating system and how it operates .
Some basic programming experience is useful but is not required .
About this tutorial
Most developers and systems administrators know what should happen in their operating system and with their applications , but sadly , this is n’t always the case .
There are times when an application has failed , or is not behaving as you expect , and you need to find out more information .
By using your existing knowledge of how your application should work and some basic UNIX skills , you can trace the application to find out what is causing the problem .
This tutorial will teach you the basic techniques of using tracing tools to find out what your application is doing behind the scenes .
First , the tutorial looks at the distinction between debugging and tracing , and how the two solutions differ .
Then it examines some specific examples of where tracing can be used to solve problems in your application .
DTrace provides elements of both system tracing and debugging , and also provides you with the ability to time and benchmark applications .
Finally , the tutorial shows how to trace the information being exchanged between network computers to help find problems in network applications .
Tracing overview
There are times when you need to know what is going on beneath the front - end of the application .
For example , you may have a failing application , with no useful error message , with a system service that does not operate the way you expect .
In these cases , you may not have the application source code , and therefore cannot perform a typical debug process to find out what is wrong .
Tracing provides you with an alternative method .
Debugging
As a developer , the obvious solution to finding a UNIX application problem is to use the debugging feature of your development environment or operating system to examine the source code and find out what is causing the problem .
Most debugging systems allow you to monitor and examine both the execution process as individual lines are executed , as well as to monitor the values of individual variables and structures .
With a debugger you can set a specific breakpoint within the code where the execution will stop and you can get information about the callstack — the current route to the function — and the variables and their values at that point .
Let ’s examine , as an example , an application that generates a calculation of a person ’s age by using the day they were born , and also taking into account leap years and other factors .
To debug the application , you need the source code and you also need to compile the application with debugging enabled , as shown here : $ gcc -g ageindays . c -o ageindays .
To run the application , you supply the user ’s date of birth and the target date when you want to make a comparison ( see Listing 1 ) .
Listing 1 . Making a comparison $ ./ ageindays
24/1/1980 22/2/2009
You have been alive 10622 days
You were born on 24/1/1980 which is a Thursday Show more Show more icon
To debug the application , you start by suspecting that the problem is located within a function called calc_diff , which compares the difference between the first and second dates .
You might next create a sequence like the one shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . Debugging the calc_diff function $ gdb ageindays GNU gdb 6.3.50‑20050815 ( Apple version gdb‑962 ) ( Sat Jul 26 08:14:40 UTC 2008 ) Copyright 2004 Free Software Foundation , Inc. GDB is free software , covered by the GNU General Public License , and you are welcome to change it and / or distribute copies of it under certain conditions .

c:89 ( gdb ) p days_diff $ 1 = 8041 ( gdb ) Show more Show more icon
You can see from the output in Listing 2 that you open the debugger , set a breakpoint in the calc_diff ( ) function by specifying it by name , and then run the program within the debugger , supplying the same arguments as you would on the command line .
Once the debugger hits the breakpoint you created , execution of the application stops , and you can examine the code of the application and the functions being called .
Using the debugger , you can see the arguments supplied to the function with their values ( in this case , the date information supplied for the target date ) .
Once execution stops , you can get a stack trace and see the exact line in the code that called the calc_diff function , and you can obtain the value of the days_diff variable .
Because the execution of the application has been paused completed , you can also modify the value of a variable .
This allows you to try out different values within the application to find potential problems .
All of this information is made available because the specific debugging information ( the symbols that make up the function and variable names ) and other metadata such as the line within the code where the function is defined .
The specific debugging information has to be added to the binary application during building , and more importantly , you have to access the source to be able to compile the application with this debug information included .
Debugging a program without being able to identify the function names and variable names is almost impossible .
Tracing compared to debugging
As a systems administrator , and often as a developer , you are more likely to be interested in finding a fault with a program .
This can be why a particular program is causing other problems ( such as memory and other errors ) , or why an application is not behaving as it should , and how it has in the past .
Debugging the specifics of the application in this instance are not often useful .
Instead , you need to examine how the application is being executed by the operating system .
With debugging , you are examining the execution of the individual functions defined within the application .
Debugging concentrates on the application and the functions and structures within it , but typically ignores the system calls and calls to library functions that are made by the application to the operating system .
Debugging provides a wealth of information about your application , but not necessarily how the operating system is executing that application .
With tracing , you are monitoring the interaction between the application and the operating system , usually by looking at the operating system functions that are called by the application during its execution .
Despite these semantic differences , the major difference between tracing and debugging is that tracing can take place without you having to have access to the source code , or to compile the application in any special way .
This means that you can trace an application that comes with the operating system , or from a third - party vendor to find out what is wrong .
Tracing an application enables you to find out :
Memory usage and calls to map memory
Files being opened and closed during execution
Reads and writes to different files
Libraries loaded for a given application
Start by examining the output from truss , tools that are available on Solaris and AIX® .
Using truss and strace
The truss tool is available on Solaris and AIX and provides the ability to trace system calls and signals within an application .
The strace tool , available on Linux® provides similar functionality .
On different systems , there are also tools that provide similar information , including ktrace ( FreeBSD ) and trace .
Overview of truss / strace
The truss and strace tools both provide similar levels of information , although the command - line options may be slightly different in each case .
With both tools , the standard way to use them is to prefix the tool to the command you would ordinarily execute .
For example , Listing 3 shows the output of truss on the ageindays program mentioned earlier in this tutorial .
Listing 3 . Output of truss $ truss ./ ageindays 24/1/1980 26/3/2009 execve ( " ageindays " , 0x08047BBC , 0x08047BCC ) argc = 3 mmap( 0x00000000 , 4096 , PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON , ‑1 , 0 ) = 0xFEFB0000 resolvepath( " /usr/lib/ld.so.1 " , " /lib/ld.so.1 " , 1023 ) = 12 getcwd ( " / root " , 1013 ) = 0 resolvepath ( " / root / ageindays " , " / root / ageindays " , 1023 ) = 15 xstat ( 2 , " / root / ageindays " , 0x08047880 ) = 0 open ( " /var/ld/ld.config " , O_RDONLY ) = 3 fxstat ( 2 , 3 , 0x08047760 ) = 0 mmap(0x00000000 , 144 , PROT_READ , MAP_SHARED , 3 , 0 ) = 0xFEFA0000 close (3 ) = 0 sysconfig( _CONFIG_PAGESIZE ) = 4096 xstat ( 2 , " /usr/lib/libc.so.1 " , 0x08046FA0 ) = 0 resolvepath ( " /usr/lib/libc.so.1 " , " /lib/libc.so.1 " , 1023 ) = 14 open ( " /usr/lib/libc.so.1 " , O_RDONLY ) = 3 mmap(0x00010000 , 32768 , PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ALIGN , 3 , 0 ) = 0xFEF90000 mmap( 0x00010000 , 1413120 , PROT_NONE , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_NORESERVE|MAP_ANON|MAP_ALIGN , ‑1 , 0 ) = 0xFEE30000 mmap(0xFEE30000 , 1302809 , PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_TEXT , 3 , 0 ) = 0xFEE30000 mmap(0xFEF7F000 , 30862 , PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|

In both cases , each line of output equates to the application executing one function call and shows the arguments to the function and the return value of the function call .
Unlike the debugging example , each function call listed is a function within the system or system libraries and therefore represents a lower - level interface to the functions called .
For example , opening a file within an application may use the fpopen ( ) function within C or C++ , but this is in fact a wrapper to the more primitive open ( ) function .
You do n’t need to understand the specifics of each function to get a general idea of what the applications are doing .
Many of the lines of the output are related to the initialization that the operating system applies in order to load and execute the program .
The fundamentals of the two traces are the same :
The execve ( ) function is called to start a new program .
function is called to start a new program .
Libraries for the program are loaded .
With the Solaries output , the libraries first look for the use of resolvepath ( ) and then open using open ( ) .
For Linux , stat ( ) is used to check whether the library exists , and then open ( ) is used to open it .
and then open using .
For Linux , is used to check whether the library exists , and then is used to open it .
Some memory is reserved and allocated for the process .
Some of this will be the stack space reserved for the application , some will be used to hold the program , and others to hold the variables used by the program .
Finally , the program is executed , and the write ( ) function is called to print out the age and day of the birth information .
If you perform a trace and want to understand the specifics of each step , use the man command to read the manual page for each function .
Identifying application startup issues
A typical problem when starting an application is that the program fails to initialize properly , but terminates with an incomplete or misleading error message .
Running a trace on the application can often highlight the problem .
For example , Listing 5 shows how a test application has failed .
Listing 5 . Application fails $ ./ errnoacc ERROR : Application failed to initialize Show more Show more icon
The error message provides no specific information about why the application failed to start .
In this case , the problem has been deliberately introduced , but the same issue could occur with any command or application you were using , and the error message could be equally misleading or sometimes non-existent .
Running a trace on the application might give us some more clues ( see Listing 6 ) .
Listing 6 . Running a trace $ truss ./ errnoacc execve ( " errnoacc " , 0x08047B20 , 0x08047B28 ) argc = 1 mmap( 0x00000000 , 4096 , PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON , ‑1 , 0 ) = 0xFEFB0000 resolvepath( " /usr/lib/ld.so.1 " , " /lib/ld.so.1 " , 1023 ) = 12 getcwd ( " / export/home /mc " , 1014 ) = 0 resolvepath ( " / export/ home/mc/errnoacc " , " / export / home/mc/errnoacc " , 1023 ) = 24 xstat ( 2 , " / export/home/mc/errnoacc " , 0x080477E4 ) = 0 open ( " /var/ld/ld.config " , O_RDONLY ) = 3 fxstat ( 2 , 3 , 0x080476C4 ) = 0 mmap(0x00000000 , 144 , PROT_READ , MAP_SHARED , 3 , 0 ) = 0xFEFA0000 close (3 ) = 0 sysconfig( _CONFIG_PAGESIZE ) = 4096 xstat ( 2 , " /usr/lib/libc.so.1 " , 0x08046F04 ) = 0 resolvepath ( " /usr/lib/libc.so.1 " , " /lib/libc.so.1 " , 1023 ) = 14 open ( " /usr/lib/libc.so.1 " , O_RDONLY ) = 3 mmap(0x00010000 , 32768 , PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ALIGN , 3 , 0 ) = 0xFEF90000 mmap( 0x00010000 , 1413120 , PROT_NONE , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_NORESERVE|MAP_ANON|MAP_ALIGN , ‑1 , 0 ) = 0xFEE30000 mmap(0xFEE30000 , 1302809 , PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_TEXT , 3 , 0 ) = 0xFEE30000 mmap(0xFEF7F000 , 30862 , PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC , MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|

The offending issue is in this line : open ( " /etc/shadow " , O_RDONLY ) Err#13 EACCES [ file_dac_read ] .
Here the application is trying to open a file to which the user running the application has no access because the file permissions have secured the file .
The application then terminates because the file cannot be opened , writing the error message in the process .
Tracing live applications
Often when you want to trace an application , it is because the application has already been started , and you want to find out why the application is not working .
Like the initialization example , often the error message or other information provided by the application may not describe the exact problem .
Locks , or attempting to access a resource that is currently in use by another process , can cause an application to apparently freeze and become unresponsive .
Both strace and truss provide the ability to “ attach ” to an already - running process .
Attaching to the process works like running the process from the command line , thus producing a list of the system functions that are being executed by the program .
The actual trace starts from the function being executed when the trace was started ; a program that has “ hung ” during execution should show you the function the program is waiting to complete .
To trace a running program , you need to specify the Process ID ( PID ) of the process that you want to trace .
For example , in Listing 6 , the program being traced has stopped but not reported an error .
Here , the ps tool has been used to determine the running processes ( see Listing 7 ) .
Listing 7 .
The ps tool is used to determine the running processes $ ps ‑ef|grep errlock mc 15779 15747 0 18:26:59 pts/2 0:00 ./ errlock mc 15742 680 0 18:26:36 pts/3 0:00 ./ errlock mc 15817 15784 0 18:28:44 pts/4 0:00 grep errlock mc 15734 680 0 18:25:00 pts/3 0:01 /usr/bin/emacs‑nox errlock .c $ truss ‑p 15779 fcntl(3 , F_SETLKW , 0x08047AC4 ) ( sleeping ... )

From this output , you can see that the fcntl ( ) function has been called to a set a lock on a file .
In this case , the function has been set to wait until the lock has been set before continuing .
Unfortunately , another process already has locked this file , so the second application will wait until the first application has finished with the file and has released the lock .
The limitation of truss in this instance is that you cannot tell what file is locked , or what file is currently locked and is holding up the execution of the second program .
This is because the tracing process did not start until after the function call that opened the file had already been called .
Both truss and strace only trace the functions as they are being executed ; they cannot go back in time and work out the functions already called .
Getting a stack trace
As you have seen , truss can be useful when you want to monitor an entire program , but may have limited use when a program has already been started .
If you are using a SVR4 - based UNIX , such as Solaris or AIX , the pstack command may help .
The pstack command is actually part of a wider set of commands that output information on running processes .
Other tools in the set include pfiles , which outputs the list of files used by a process , and psig , which show the list of signals and signal handlers .
To use each command , you specify the PID of the process .
The pstack command outputs the call stack for a running process , showing the list of functions called before the process reached the current function .
For example , using pstack on the process waiting on a locked file produces the following from Listing 8 .
Listing 8 .
Using pstack on the process waiting on a locked file $ pstack 15828 15828 : ./ errlock feef0877 fcntl ( 3 , 7 , 8047ac4 ) feedcd49 fcntl ( 3 , 7 , 8047ac4 , 8050e74 ) + 91 08050f10 main ( 1 , 8047b24 , 8047b2c ) + d8 08050cdc _start ( 1 , 8047c08 , 0 , 8047c12 , 8047c7d , 8047c8e ) + 80 Show more

In this case , it does n’t provide you with the information you need .
Now try pfiles ( see Listing 9 ) .
Listing 9 . Using pfiles $ pfiles 15856 15856 : ./ errlock Current rlimit : 256 file descriptors 0 : S_IFCHR mode:0620 dev:292,0 ino:989038936 uid:101 gid:7 rdev:24,3 O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY|O_LARGEFILE

This time the output is more useful .
You can see that the file that has been opened by the process is called lockdemo , and since truss showed that the file is waiting for a lock , it is probably this file causing the problem .
Both truss and strace are examples of passive tracing .
You can watch the functions as they are executed , but you ca n’t extract more detail about what is going on , or make more detailed decisions about what to trace , and what information to output when the trace occurs .
Dynamic tracing with DTrace
The Dynamic Tracing ( DTrace ) functionality built into Solaris , FreeBSD , and Mac OS X provides , as the name suggests , a more dynamic tracing environment .
Unlike truss and similar tools , DTrace enables you to examine the internals of the programs you are running , and not just the system calls .
Furthermore , with DTrace you can script the tracing of an application to customize the information you want to extract during the tracing process .
DTrace overview
DTrace combines many of the principles of the tracing that you have already seen with truss and strace , but adds a great deal of flexibility to the method and mechanism used to trace an application .
Unlike truss and strace , which list only functions within the kernel space , DTrace can be used to show the function names of the application , any libraries on which it relies , and the functions in the kernel that are called .
This extends the usability of the tracing almost to the same level as a debugger .
However , unlike a debugger , you cannot modify the values , and you cannot pause or otherwise alter the execution of the application .
You are limited to tracing the execution , not controlling it .
The other key element of DTrace compared to both tracing and the majority of debuggers is that you can write a script that defines what to trace within the application , and information should be reported when the application executes .
For example , you can specify that DTrace report only on a specific function , and that it prints out a single argument from the function call .
In addition to printing specific information , DTrace also provides built - in support for a number of utility values and functions .
Within a script , for example , you can record a timestamp of when the function was called , and then compare the timestamp value with the timestamp when the function completes .
By comparing the two values you can obtain the execution time for a specific function , or operation , and use the tracing information to provide execution and performance statistics .
Probes and providers
DTrace works by adding instrumentation to the system that identifies different points of execution .
These points are called probes and include probes defined within the kernel , libraries , and programs .
All functions within the kernel , libraries , and user programs can be identified as a probe .
In addition , statically defined probes can be used to identify special points of interest .
For example , the kernel includes probes that can be used to identify when data is written to a disk .
As a developer , you can add specific probes to your program to enable tracing by your users .
These probes are identified as User - land Statically Defined Tracing , or USDT .
Probes are identified using the following structure : provider : module : function : name , where provider is the name of the provider ( for example , the name of a program , or a specific part of the kernel or operating system ) .
The module is the kernel module or library , and the function is usually the function name within the module or program , and the name identifies the probe .
The provider also has a special identifier , the PID provider , which is used to identify any running program and can be used to trace any function within a running program .
The name is usually the name of a specific probe within the system or program that has been specifically defined .
DTrace also supports function boundary tracing ( FBT ) , which enables you to trace the entry and return from any function within the kernel , library or an application .
With FBT , the entry probe is triggered when the function is called , and the return probe is triggered when the function returns or completes .
Any of the components within the probe specification can either be omitted ( in which case the probe specification matches all items ) or with a wildcard .
For example , you can specify all of the probes within a given provider using : provider : : : .
Or you can specify only the entry probes on a PID provider : pid$target : :: entry .
The above probe specification is similar to the operation of truss , except that the functions will cover both the program , the operating system , and any libraries on which the program relies .
This provides a much wider scope than truss .
When using the PID provider , the module can be used to identify the program .
Without this specification , you trace every function called by the program .
By specifying the program name , you limit the output to the functions defined within the program .
For example , to trace the execution of the functions within the ageindays command , you might use : pid$target : ageindays : : .
Any program can be traced using dtrace ; you do not compile the program in a specific way .
This means that unlike truss , you can gain a deeper understanding of an application even if you do n’t own the source to the program in question .
You can obtain a list of probes using the dtrace tool ; the -l command line option will list all of the probes defined in the system : $ dtrace -l .
The list can be many thousands of lines long .
One - line tracing
As already noted , you can trace any application and any function within that application using DTrace .
There are three ways to use dtrace from the command line : specifying a command ; specifying a process ID ; or specifying a named , static , probe .
Specify a command on the command - line to be executed ( using - c ) , and specify the probe you want to monitor using the -n option ( see Listing 10 ) .
Listing 10 .
Specifying the probe you want to monitor $ dtrace ‑n ' pid$target:ageindays : : entry ' ‑c './ ageindays
24/1/1980 26/3/1980 ' dtrace : description ' pid$target : ageindays ::entry ' matched 7 probes

Show more
Show more icon
Now specify the process ID of a program already running , and the probe that you want to trace .
For example , the line in Listing 11 traces calls to the syslog system by the inetd daemon .
Listing 11 .
Tracing calls to the syslog system $ dtrace ‑n ' pid$target : : syslog : entry { printf ( " %d %s " , arg0 , copyinstr ( arg1 ) ) }' ‑p pgrep ‑x inetd Show more Show more icon
Or you can specify the name of a static probe , which will match all of the probes within any running process .
For example , the line in Listing 12 looks for any exec functions being called ( for example , when a user runs a command in a shell ) .
Because you have n’t specified a specific process , this probe will work for any call to the function by any user on the system ( see Listing 12 ) .
Listing 12 .
Specifying the name of a static probe $ dtrace ‑n ' syscall : : exec∗:entry ' dtrace : description ' syscall : :exec∗:entry ' matched 2 probes CPU ID FUNCTION : NAME 0 56750 exece : entry 0 56750 exece : entry 0 56750 exece : entry Show more Show more icon
In all of these examples , you have only used the basic output , which just outputs the function or probe name , and the CPU and process ID where the probe was triggered .
More extensive and selective probing and custom output is available by using the D scripting language .
Writing a DTrace script
The DTrace scripting language provides a simple mechanism for executing specific operations ( called actions ) when a probe is triggered by a provider .
The language is limited in that you do not have the flexibility of a full language environment such as PHP or Perl , but you do have the ability to record information into variables , perform basic calculations , and support basic decision making .
A basic example that prints out the values when a specific probe is executed is shown below .
The arguments to a probe or function are available using the aliases arg0 , arg1 , and so on for each argument .
For this example , you are monitoring all of the functions starting with those open for a given process , and printing out the file opened in each case .
Listing 13 .
Monitoring all functions starting with open for a given process #!/ bin/dtrace ‑s # pragma D option quiet pid$target : : open∗ : entry { printf ( " Opened : %s
" , copyinstr ( arg0 ) ) ; } Show more Show more icon
You can save this text into a file called open.t , and then set the execute bit on the file : $ chmod +x open .t .
The file is now an executable script .
To use it , supply the process ID with the -p command line option .
For example , running it against a shell , you get the list of files the shell opens during execution ( see Listing 14 ) .
Listing 14 .
Using the - p option $ ./open.t ‑p 15930 Opened : /root/.bash_path Opened : /root /.bash_vars
Opened : /root /.bashrc Opened : /root/.bash_aliases ... Show more

A more typical use for DTrace scripts is to aggregate and summarize information , and provide counters and time differences between different operations .
The probes within a DTrace script are executed sequentially within a single thread , which means that you can monitor the execution of a series of probes .
Many probes are provided in pairs , with the start probe indicating where an operation begins , and the done probe where an operation completes .
By recording the time when the start probe was triggered , and then when the probe completed , you can determine how long the operation took to complete .
Within a DTrace script , the self variable can be used to hold the start time .
For example , the script in Listing 15 uses named probes within the MySQL database system to monitor the execution time of a query .
Listing 15 .
Using named probes within MySQL to monitor execution time of a query #!/usr /sbin/dtrace ‑s # pragma D option quiet dtrace ::: BEGIN { printf ( " % ‑80s %6s
" , " Query " , " Duration ( ms ) " ) ; } mysql∗ ::: query‑start { self ‑> query = copyinstr ( arg5 ) ; self ‑> querystart = timestamp ; } mysql∗ ::: query‑done { this ‑> elapsed = ( timestamp ‑ self‑> querystart ) / 1000000 ; printf ( " % ‑80s %6 d
" , self ‑> query , this ‑> elapsed ) ; } Show more

The trace shows a number of different elements of a typical DTrace script .
First , the BEGIN block outputs some header information , which is useful when you are printihg out tabulated data .
The query - start probes include a number of arguments , and the sixth argument ( arg5 ) contains the full text of the original query .
When running the query on a server running MySQL , you can get useful statistics about the time taken to run each query ( see Listing 16 ) .
Listing 16 .
Getting statistics about the time taken to run each query $ ./ basic.d Query Duration ( ms ) show tables 203 select ∗ from t1 where i < 5 131526 Show more Show more icon
These examples have barely scratched the surface of what DTrace is capable of achieving .

Tracing network packets
Tracing the application code can tell you what is going on within the application , and it can show you what a system is doing , but what if you want to monitor a network application and find out what information is being transferred over the network ?
There are many tools available , but the snoop tool in Solaris , iptrace in AIX and the Ethereal tool for many different platforms all provide the ability to view the packets going by on the network .
Network tracing basics
Nearly all of the different tools for tracing network packets work in the same basic fashion .
Normally , your computer reads packets from the network and only processes and acts on the network packets that were specifically sent to your computer .
With older Ethernet networks , all packets were sent to all computers .
With a network switch , if you want to view packets other than those for your computer , you may need to connect to the management port on your network .
The methods for using these tools and the information they can provide differ slightly , but the fundamentals are the same .
With AIX , the iptrace is a background daemon , so you must explicitly start and stop the tool to switch the process on and off .
For example , to start , type : # startsrc -s iptrace - a " - i tr0 /home/user / iptrace / log1 " .
To stop the tool , type : # stopsrc -s iptrace .
On Solaris , the snoop tool is an application that you can execute at will : # snoop .
However , the number of packets on a typical network may be too much to be decoded and displayed on the fly .
In this case , you can either specify a limiting scan , by setting the port name or number , or the computer name or number , or output the raw data to a file and then post - process the file .
You can record the information by setting the output file : $ snoop -o networkdump.log .
To read in the saved data , type : $ snoop - i networkdump.log .
When using snoop for tracing applications , you will probably want to be more specific about your searches .
Scanning for a specific host with snoop
Typical uses for snoop during tracing are to find if an application is communicating over the network , or to find the specifics of what information is being exchanged .
For example , if you are trying to diagnose a problem between an NFS server and the NFS client , you might want to ensure that the two machines are actually exchanging information .
One way to do this is to use snoop to monitor the data exchanged .
On the client , you could use snoop to log the data being transferred to and from the server .
For example , Listing 17 looks for traffic to the host called bear .
Listing 17 .

Fortunately , you can see that data is being exchanged .
Snoop is capable of decoding the contents of the raw packets to determine what data is actually being exchanged .
In this case , the GETATTR3 network packet with NFS is being used , which gets the attribute data for a file ( such as the name , size , and ownership information ) .
There is a lot of additional information being shown , so you could also be more explicit and select only the NFS packets .
You can combine the expression used to specify what data to select by combining them like this : $ snoop host bear and protocol nfs .
To get more detailed information , you can use the verbose mode to output the actual data being exchanged .
With the verbose mode enabled , snoop will debug each component of the packet , from the raw Ethernet header data to the individual TCP and protocol information .
A single packet showing the output when filesystem state data is requested over NFS is shown in Listing 18 .

Looking for specific information can also be useful if you want to determine what different applications are doing .
For example , you may want to monitor what Web sites are being accessed from a host , which you can do by looking for the HTTP protocol and only outputting the HTTP lines from the snoop output ( see Listing 19 ) .
Listing 19 .
Monitoring what Web sties are being accessed from a host $ snoop ‑v port 80 |egrep ' ^ HTTP ' ... HTTP : ‑‑‑‑‑ HyperText Transfer Protocol ‑‑‑‑ ‑ HTTP : HTTP : GET / HTTP /1.0 HTTP : User ‑Agent : Wget / 1.10.2 HTTP : Accept : ∗/∗ HTTP : Host : www.bbc.co.uk HTTP : Connection : Keep ‑Alive HTTP : ......

Summary
Conclusion
Tracing , and the need to trace your application , can come from many different areas .
As a developer , tracing an application can be a quicker alternative than resorting to a full debugger when you are trying to diagnose a problem .
Tools like DTrace can be even more intrusive and retrieve some very specific , and extensive , information about your application .
For administrators , tracing provides the only method for locating and finding the information that you need to diagnose problems .
Without access to the source code , tracing is often your only means of determining what an application is doing .
This tutorial showed that with tracing alone , you can find and diagnose problems with just a few commands .
( CNN ) --
When Jon Bohmer sat down with his two little girls for a simple project they could work on together , he did n't realize they'd hit upon a solution to one of the world 's biggest problems for just $ 5 : A solar - powered oven .
Inventor Jon Bohmer with the oven he has made out of a cardboard box .
The ingeniously simple design uses two cardboard boxes , one inside the other , and an acrylic cover that lets in the sun 's rays and traps them .
Black paint on the inner box , and silver foil on the outer one , help concentrate the heat .
The trapped rays make the inside hot enough to cook casseroles , bake bread and boil water .
What the box also does is eliminate the need in developing countries for rural residents to cut down trees for firewood .
About 3 billion people around the world do so , adding to deforestation and , in turn , global warming .
By allowing users to boil water , the simple device could also potentially save the millions of children who die from drinking unclean water .
Bohmer 's invention on Thursday won the FT Climate Change Challenge , which sought to find and publicize the most innovative and practical solution to climate change .
" A lot of scientists are working on ways to send people to Mars .
I was looking for something a little more grassroots , a little simpler , " Bohmer said Thursday .
Bohmer 's contest win notwithstanding , solar cooking with a cardboard oven is n't new .
Two American women , Barbara Kerr and Sherry Cole , were the solar box cooker 's first serious promoters in the 1970s .
They and others joined forces to create the non-profit Solar Cookers International -- originally called Solar Box Cookers International -- in 1987 .
Further , the organization 's executive director , Patrick Widner , said that the plans for a solar box cooker were found in a book published by the Peace Corps in the 1960s .
" We are pleased that Mr. Bohmer has taken up the cause and interest of the 95 member organizations and 160 individuals of the Solar Cookers Worldwide Network , " Widner said .
" It would be a pleasure to work with Mr. Bohmer in Kenya where we have been promoting the use of solar cookers for ten years . "
Bohmer , a Norwegian - born entrepreneur based in Kenya , said he also had been looking at solutions " way too complex , for way too long . "
" This took me about a weekend , and it worked on the first try , " Bohmer said .
" It 's mind - boggling how simple it is . "
The contest was organized by the Forum for the Future -- a sustainable development charity -- and the Financial Times newspaper .
Among the judges were British business magnate Richard Branson and environmentalist Rajendra Pachauri .
The public also voted on the finalists .
Bohmer 's invention beat about 300 other entries , including a machine that turns wood and other organic material into charcoal , wheel covers that make trucks more fuel efficient by reducing drag , and a feed supplement for livestock that reduces the methane they emit by 15 percent .
Bohmer named his invention the Kyoto Box , after the international environmental treaty to reduce global warming .
The box can be produced in existing cardboard factories .
It has gone into production in a factory in Nairobi , Kenya , that can churn out about 2.5 million boxes a month .
Bohmer has also designed a more durable version , made from recycled plastic , which can be produced just as cheaply .
He envisions such cardboard ovens being distributed throughout rural Africa .
" In the West , we cook with electricity , so it 's easy to ignore this problem , " he said .
" But half the world 's population is still living in a stone age .
The only way for them to cook is to make a fire .
" I do n't want to see another 80 - year - old woman carrying 20 kilos of firewood on her back .
Maybe we do n't have to . "

Apple has apologised for a " deeply offensive " iPhone application called Baby Shaker , which made a game of quieting crying babies by shaking them .
It removed the $ 0.99 ( £ 0.59 ) game from its iTunes Store on Wednesday , two days after it went on sale .
It sparked outrage from children 's groups and brain injury foundations .
The aim of the game was to quieten babies by shaking the iPhone until a pair of thick red Xs appeared over each eye of a baby drawn in black and white .
" This application was deeply offensive and should not have been approved for distribution on the App Store , " Apple said in a statement .
" We sincerely apologise for this mistake and thank our customers for bringing this to our attention . "
But an Apple spokeswoman would not comment on why the program - developed by a company called Sikalosoft - was approved for sale in the first place , nor how many people had downloaded it .
Campaigners ' dismay Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The iTunes description included the line : " See how long you can endure his or her adorable cries before you just have to find a way to quiet the baby down ! "
It also included a disclaimer : " Never shake a baby . "
Officials from Sikalosoft were not available for comment .
US - based organisations which seek to prevent brain injuries from Shaken Baby Syndrome ( SBS ) - including the National Centre on Shaken Baby Syndrome and the Sarah Jane Brain Foundation - condemned Apple for approving the game 's sale .
Jetta Bernier , executive director of Massachusetts Citizens for Children , said : " I am disheartened that with this new application Apple is encouraging frustrated adults to shake infants , not only to end their crying , but to end their lives .
" There are many effective infant soothing strategies that adults can use to calm their fussy , crying babies .
Shaking is not one of them , " the Daily Telegraph reported her as saying .
Popular programs
The outrage over Baby Shaker came as Apple celebrated the one billionth download from its App Store , which launched nine months ago .
" The speed with which the App Store has ramped up is impressive and has really set the bar high for everyone else , " analyst Van Baker of Gartner told the BBC .
" Everyone from Nokia to Palm and from RIM ( BlackBerry ) to Google with Android are trying to follow suit .
The question remains as to how good a job they will do . "
There are more than 35,000 applications in the store .
Some are free and the most expensive are $ 9.99 ( £ 6.82 ) .
Apple has highlighted the most popular applications .
At time of writing a game called Catcha Mouse is top of the free download category with more than one million downloads .
In the paid section , the top spot is taken by a game called StickWars .
Apple is rewarding the downloader of the one billionth app with a prize that will total over $ 13,000 .
The gift will include a 17 " MacBook Pro , iPod Touch , a $ 10,000 iTunes gift certificate and an Apple Time Capsule .

The part of the skull showing prematurely fused sutures : ( A ) The first segment is completely fused .
( B ) The second segment is fused , but still noticeable .
( C ) The lambdoid portion of the suture is completely open ( Image : National Academy of Sciences , PNAS )
A recently unearthed ancient human skull shows signs of a disorder that might have caused mental retardation .
This offers the earliest evidence that ancestors of Homo sapiens did not abandon young with severe birth defects .
The 500,000 - year - old skeleton belonged to a five to 12 - year - old child who suffered from craniosynostosis .
The rare congenital condition occurs when two of the flat bones that make up the skull fuse together along their margins ( sutures ) too early during fetal development , hindering brain growth .
Spanish researchers discovered the first pieces of the skull near Atapuerca , Spain , in 2001 , but they only recently pieced enough of it together to make a conclusive diagnosis .

“ We were sure we had evidence of a real pathology , ” says Ana Gracia , a palaeoanthropologist at Complutense University in Madrid , who led the new study .
“ It ’s obvious – you only have to look at the cranium . ”
Different appearance
The child suffered from a form of craniosynostosis that occurs in about 1 in every 200,000 children .
He or she was a member of the species Homo heidelbergensis , – early humans that lived in Europe up to 800,000 years ago and may have given rise to Neanderthals .
The discovery marks the earliest example of a human skeleton with signs of a physical deformity that that might have made the individual dependent on others for survival .
Most animals , including primates , sacrifice or abandon young born with crippling deformities , Gracia says .
It ’s impossible to know whether the child suffered from any cognitive problems , but he or she would undoubtedly have looked different from family and friends , she says .
‘ Not clear - cut ’
“ The obvious conclusion is that [ this child ] was being helped by other members of the social group , ” says Erik Trinkaus , a paleoanthropologist at Washington University in Saint Louis , Missouri .
However , Matthew Speltz , a psychologist at the University of Washington in Seattle , says the link between craniosynostosis and cognitive problems is not so clear - cut .
Speltz is leading an ongoing study to track the development of children born with various forms of the condition .
His team has found that children with craniosynostosis are more likely than other kids to have cognitive and motor problems .
But the condition is by no means a guarantee of severe learning difficulties .
“ There might be a slight increased risk of mental retardation , ” he says .

I looked online and luckily found these FANTASTIC products
Ever in your gratitude
We purchased our cocker puppy from Arkansas and had her flown to us in Washington state .
When we received her at 8 wks .
of age , she had a large impetigo sore , mites and fleas .
I wo n't mention the name of the " dealer " , as that is not the purpose of this writing .
Our puppy was itching and scratching constantly and licking at the sore .
We took her to a vet right away and like so many others , their mange medicine and mange remedies DID NOT WORK AT ALL .
So , I looked online and luckily found these FANTASTIC mange cure products .
We used thecream , the mange shampoo and the Mange Spray as directed and within 2 days she was barely scratching .
Now it 's been 2 weeks of mange treatment and there is literally NO SIGN of the mange mite problem she came to us with .
We can't begin to tell you how much we appreciate your products being there so that we could SAFELY treat our puppy .
Ever in your gratitude .

“ My poor Shelby was only 6 months old when she got Mange .
I started treating it right away , but it just kept getting worse .
The vet said Shelby was reacting to the pesticides in the medications I was using .
I could n't believe they would give me something with pesticides in it to put on open sores .
I was POISONING her and did n't even know it .
I got online and ordered Pets 'BestRx™ mange sprays that same night .
Thank God .
Within a week my little angel was almost completely back to her old self .
Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart … ”

Gizmo's Vet Could n't Treat His Demodectic Mange with Ivomec
Learn How Pets ' BestRx™ Did The Job !
" Gizmo 's condition of generalized demodectic mange was severely worsening , even after almost 3 weeks of treatment with Ivomec .
The vet was going to put him on an alternative medication for mange , very costly medication that would require Gizmo to get shots regularly , since the Ivomec did not seem to be working .
I did n't want to do that to him so I looked online for more information on alternative treatments and found Pets ' BestRx™ .
Now he 's all better .
It 's really a shame that more people do n't know about Pets ' BestRx ™ because it could save a lot of suffering for and pets and money for the Pet owner .
Curious to know , " What does mange look like ? " Pictures of Gizmo's Mange » - Valerie K. , Aliso Viejo , CA

It 's important to remember your pet ’s immune system is the key to controlling Demodectic Mange .

and a COMPLETE mange treatment that will :
Attack infection and treat the skin quickly Eliminate the mange on your pet Boost your pets immune system Eradicate the cause of mange in your environment to reduce re infestation
PetsBestRx offers the COMPLETE Mange Cure you need .
Antibiotics is often not enough or do NOT always work when treating for a mange cure or various skin conditions in animals .
Antibiotics also prohibit your pet 's immune system from doing its job which can dramatically weaken their immune system and make your pet susceptible to many life - threatening illnesses !
If your pets immune system is compromised , it does not have the ability to fight off the infection and demodectic mange .
Sarcoptic mange is much easier to treat and does not require so much of your pet .

It can be diagnosed , but most times the problem is so advanced it does not show up on skin scrapings .
Your Veterinarian can perform these skin scrapings but please be aware that to correctly diagnose Demodectic Mange , your Vet must scrap 3 to 5 dermal layers deep to get to the source of it .
This means that your pet will undoubtedly experience bleeding .

The mites that humans get from pets are usually easy to treat and if you do nothing , the itching will go away within 2 to 3 weeks ; but who wants to itch intensively for that long ?
What are some mange treatment ?

There are 4 different main types of Mange :
Demodectic Mange ( Red Mange , Demo Mange , Demodex , Puppy Mange )
( Red Mange , Demo Mange , Demodex , Puppy Mange ) Sarcoptic Mange - HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS
- HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS Notoedric Mange ( Cat Mange ) - HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS
( Cat Mange ) - HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS Cheyletiella Mange ( Walking Dandruff ) - HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS
How to tell difference between sarcoptic mange and demodectic mange ?
In order to properly treat your pet for mange , it is very important that you understand the differences between these types dog mange symptoms or cat mange symptoms .
Do n't get confused with glover mange ; this is not condition for pets .
Glovers mange is a condition commonly associated with dandruff for people .
The Glover Company in 1936 created a product called Glovers Mange to treat dandruff in people and it does not eliminate mange at all .
DEMODECTIC MANGE
Demodectic Mange is commonly referred to as Red Mange , Demodex Canis , Demo Mange , Puppy Mange or Demodex Mange .
This type of mange is not contagious , but it has the ability to spread quickly and produce a septic smell caused by secondary bacterial infections .
If your puppy has mange , chances are he has demo mange .
Demo Mange is the most serious type of animal Mange .
Because the mites have burrowed so far down , mange infection usually occurs .
The itching becomes intense which is an immune response to the mite ’s exoskeletons , saliva and feces .
The mite ’s saliva , bodily secretions and feces cause the hair follicle to become inflamed , irritated and infected ; all the time the mite continues digging and biting .
These mites are commonly referred to as follicle mites or Demodex follicularum ; the mite lives their entire life cycle within hair follicles of dogs and other animals .
Most dogs have the mite and staphylococcus bacterium ; however if their immune system is compromised , they develop mange .
The hair loss is usually seen first around the muzzle , eyes and forefeet .
There is no cure for this type of mange .
You can only treat and minimize the outbreaks .
This type of mange is inherited from the mother and most often the pet is born with a compromised immune system which means they can't fight off the mange and infection gets out of hand .
This often leads in death or it suffers intensely .
Additionally , if left untreated , the hair follicle becomes so damaged , the hair does not grow back .
We highly recommend that you contact our office when dealing with this type of mange so that we can offer you one - on - one personal attention specific for demodectic mange .
Our Pet Healthcare Advisors have been specifically trained to get you started on an aggressive mange regimen to treat Demodectic Mange .
When dealing with demodex mange , feet or paws are often affected ; most commonly called pyroderma .
This is a condition when the pet chews on their paws and the pads often appear swollen and inflamed .
Our PetsBestRx demodex natural mange cure relieves the pain , the itch and inflammation commonly associated with pyroderma .

SARCOPTIC MANGE
Sarcoptes scabei
Mange is the less serious , yet highly contagious , type of itch mange .
Sarcoptic mange , aka " Scabies , " has zoonotic potential , which means it 's the mite you can get from your pet !
Mange in humans is called scabies and is easier to get rid of .
Sarcoptic
Mange is much easier to cure because the Sarcoptic mite does n't penetrate as deep into the hair follicle of your pet .
These mites still causes intense itching , followed by flaky or scabby dandruff and loss of hair .
Infection is not usually associated with this type of mange ; however if the skin is torn from intense scratching , a bacterial infection can be present .
We recommend using our complete Natural Mange Treatment with Mange Cream to be successful treating for mange .
This type of mange does n't occur often in cats and is generally short - lived if present .
Steps to treat the itching and irritation due to the Sarcoptic mange mites are however recommended .

NOTOEDRIC MANGE
Notoedric mange ( Cats Mange ) - Notoedric
Mange is closely related to Sarcoptic mange in dogs , but it is mange on cats .
Both conditions typically begin with itchy crusts and scales on the ear margins .
The mites may quickly move to the face and , if left untreated , can spread to your pet 's entire body .
Cat mange comes from external parasites that burrow into the skin of your cat and cause damage to their skin and hair follicles .
Notoedric mange or Cats Mange causes sores , lesions , and / or hair loss and is the only mange on cats condition .
Like Sarcoptic Mange , Notoedric Mange is also a highly Contagious cat mange disease .

CHEYLETIELLA MANGE
Cheyletiellosis is a mild skin condition caused by Cheyletiella .
It is also known as walking dandruff because it resembles a bad case of dandruff typically found on the neck and back .
Cheyletiella live on epidermal layers of dogs , cats , rabbits , humans , and other animals .
They do not burrow into the skin but live in the keratin level .
Their entire 21 - day life cycle is on one host .
They can not survive off the host for more than 10 days .
Cheyletiella is highly contagious mange disease and it is transferred by direct contact with an affected animal .
The disease can be without dog mange symptoms or can include intense itching , scaly skin and hair loss .

How It Works
WARNING
There is a Difference Between
White & Yellow Sulfur !
Ours Theirs Methyl Sulfonyl Methane ( White ) Sulfur Lime ( Yellow ) Sulfur
We urge you to learn more & inquire before you buy !
Pets 'BestRx™ Uses ONLY
White Sulfur ( MSM ) Mange Cream , mange sprays or mange medicine containing both types of sulfur have been proven to be highly successful when treating ringworm , dog mange , hotspots , sores , ear itching and other common skin problems .
However , the differences between the two types of Mange Cream to cure pet mange and knowing how to treat mange the correct and quick way are listed below .
The first type is made of Methyl Sulfonyl Methane ( White Sulfur ) .
It is safe , Nontoxic and easy to apply .
This is not a mange dip .
You can simply rub this mange cream or mange medicine into your pet ’s skin with your fingers without the fear of it staining your pet ’s coat or your clothing and furniture .
This product even works wonders for dry skin .
Pets 'BestRx™ Mange Products use only Highly Refined MSM ( White Sulfur ) and are the best medicated creams for pet mange .
The second type is made of Lime ( Yellow ) sulfur .
Unlike White sulfur ( a.k.a. MSM ) , Lime sulfur requires the use of protective rubber gloves when applying the product and must be used in a well - ventilated area .
Undiluted or large quantities of Lime sulfur are corrosive to the skin and may cause serious injury .
These products are not suitable for use on cats or small animals under 12 weeks of age .
It may also stain your pet ’s coat , your clothing and furniture , and especially your jewelry .
Its use is better suited for barnyard animals .
Remember : An Informed Customer is the Best Kind of Customer !
For even more protection , use Pets ' BestRx ™ Pet Shampoo medicated mange medicine to treat infection and clean your pet 's coat and skin ; very critical when treating for Demodectic mange
Pets'BestRx™ Pet Shampoo is a medicinal shampoo and is not your ordinary pet shampoo .
It Cleans and rejuvenates your pet 's skin & coat while penetrating deep to eliminate odors , build - up and debris .
It does n't strip your pet ’s skin of its natural oils , nor is it loaded with conditioners and fillers that coat the hair and skin , becoming a natural magnet for dirt .
Pets 'BestRx™ Pet Shampoo does not contain skin irritants , abrasives or harsh detergents .
The pH balanced solution preserves the natural acid mantle barrier of a healthy pet 's skin without drying or chapping .
Your pet will look better than you have ever seen them with a clean , shiny coat and without any perfume smell .
Your pet 's coat will be soft and clean to the touch .

WARNING :
Many Prescription Mange Treatments may be TOXIC to your pet
IVERMECTIN ( Ivomec ) is a broad spectrum anti-parasitic medication generally used for livestock and horses .
While it is licensed for use in dogs and cats as a heart worm preventative and topical ear therapy , it is NOT FDA approved for the treatment of mange .
However , it is often prescribed for such mange treatments .
Normally , in small doses , Ivermectin has little to no side effects ; however , the dosage necessary for treatment of mange causes issues , especially in certain breeds of dogs including Collies , Shetland sheepdogs , Australian shepherds , Old English sheepdogs and other herding breeds .
MITABAN is a brand name parasitical drug used for the treatment of mange .
The active ingredient in Mitaban is Amitraz .
The mechanism of action for amitraz is currently unknown ; however , the most current data available suggests that the drug may actually act on the central nervous system of the animals .
The Mitaban treatments last 2 - 3 months , with dips every two weeks .
Generally , dips must be given by a veterinarian and the cure rate on the recommended dose is approximately 60 % .
Dogs not cured by the recommended dose have been given up to 5 times the recommended dose in order to increase the cure rate up to 85 % .
These excessive Mitaban dosages have resulted in respiratory failure , cancer and general immune system failure .
Many times , our customers have come to us because their pet 's condition has either not improved / worsened , or they just do n't want to risk their pet 's health on a treatment that might not work .
Even if the prescribed Mange Treatment with Mange Cream does cure red mange or cure sarcoptic mange problems , what was the cost ?
Not only are these dog mange treatments expensive , but you are actually be putting your pet at risk .
Also , neither of these mange products treat the bacteria infection that accompanies mange and they require heavy antibiotics to fight the infection that your pet 's suppressed immune system can’t fight .
Think about it : with a failure rate of 4 out of 10 pets with a now compromised immune system and they are still sick , are you willing to take that kind of chance with your pet who is suffering with mange and mange disease ?

How to Block the DiggBar
Last week Digg released something they call the DiggBar , which serves as both a new interface for Digg and doubles as a URL shortening service .
The way it works is that you just add “ digg.com / ” at the beginning of any URL , and Digg creates a short URL in the form of digg.com /1234 .
Here ’s an example DiggBar URL that points to google.com : http://digg.com/d1nYVs.
Further , the Digg homepage now links to these DiggBar URLs rather than linking directly to other web sites .
But unlike normal URL shortening services , when you load these Digg URLs , rather than redirect you to the original URL , Digg loads a page which frames the content of the original site .
As a user , what you see is that the URL in your browser ’s location field remains digg.com / 1234 , and the content of the destination site loads underneath a Digg - branded toolbar .
This , of course , is total bullshit .
All sorts of sites tried this sort of trickery back in the mid-’90s when Netscape Navigator 2.0 added support for the < frameset > tag .
It did not take long for a broad consensus to develop that framing someone else ’s site was wrong .
URLs are the building block of the Web .
They tell the user where they are .
They give you something to bookmark to go back or to share with others .
The DiggBar breaks that , and I ’ve seen no argument that makes it any more sense to support this than it does to support 1996 - style < frameset > site embedding .
So , shortly after it was announced , I wrote code to block it from Daring Fireball .
If you attempt to view most pages on DF through the DiggBar , you ’ll be greeted with a special message just for Digg instead of the regular content of the page .
Digg sends a tremendous amount of traffic to sites that make it to the top of their front page , but it ’s the worst kind of traffic : mindless , borderline illiterates .
Good riddance , really .
A lot of people have asked , so I figured I should explain how I ’m doing it .
The basic idea is that when a web page is loaded inside a frame , its HTTP referrer is set to that of the parent ( i.e. framing ) page .
In the normal , non-framing context , the referrer tells the address of the page from which the current page being requested was linked to .
Most pages on DF are served through PHP , so I added a short bit of PHP near the top that looks like this :
<? php if ( preg_match ( ' # http://digg.com/\w{1,8}/*(\?.*)?$#', $ _SERVER [ ' HTTP_REFERER ' ] ) ) { echo " < p > Special message for Digg users here .
</p > " ; exit ; } ?>
The first line uses a regular expression to check if the HTTP referrer looks like a DiggBar URL , which , for my purposes , I ’ve defined as “ digg.com / ” followed by exactly 1 - 8 letters or numbers and an optional trailing slash .
It does n’t attempt to block all referring URLs from Digg , just those that look like DiggBar pages .
If the pattern matches , it prints a special message for Digg users and calls PHP ’s standard exit function , which stops the rest of the page from being transmitted .
[ Update : I ’ve tweaked the regex pattern a bit so that it also matches DiggBar URLs with a trailing “ / ” and / or “ ? ” . ]
Some sites use JavaScript to completely block framing ; I do n’t want to do that , and , given DF ’s configuration , it was easier for me to use PHP to target Digg specifically .
Health authorities believe Victoria 's record - breaking heatwave might have contributed to the deaths of about 374 people .
As temperatures soared between January 26 and February 1 , so did the state 's death toll with a 62 % jump from the same time last year .
Victoria 's chief health officer Dr John Carnie today revealed 980 people had died during the week compared to a mean of 606 deaths for the previous five years .
Most of those who died , 248 people , were aged 75 years or older with 46 people aged between 65 and 74 .
Dr Carnie said it was not possible to say how many of the deaths had been brought forward by days or weeks because of the extreme heat .
Special people require special gifts when there is a celebratory occasion .
Such is the case of one of my favorite professors who is retiring .
I want to give him something appropriate , not too fancy or expensive , but shows that I care about this major life change .
Certain milestones are rather significant and this one , while about a professional relationship , is nevertheless very personal to me .
I want to send him off in style with a small party to which everyone brings a little token gift .
I thought of a book on holistic medicine .
There is a new one on the market that he probably does n’t own .
I think this would be appropriate and I can write an inscription inside the cover .
Something like this :
Retirement is a time of reflection and new beginnings .
May you enjoy your moments of freedom with gusto and ease .
I will miss your constant presence , but will always remember you fondly with esteem .
Then I will sign my name .
The last day of class , I brought the book wrapped in festive paper .
There was going to be a party nearby to send him off in style .
He took the book and said he would treasure the gift from a favorite student .
I was so flattered , but not as much as I was when he bestowed upon me a surprise present .
I was humbled that he had thought of me with a very nice high - end rechargeable pen light .
This was so useful , perfect , and a gift to cherish .
This kind of consideration does n’t always happen in an academic environment .
As a matter of fact , I did n’t have a penlight , but it was more than that .
The gift was symbolic of a long - standing , solid relationship .
You welcome these moments in life as they are few and far between .
It was a fond farewell and a bit sad .
I love the penlight .
When I am out late at night and am trying to find my way or get the key in the car door , I can get it out in a second .
For a small item , it has surprising range .
I also like to use it to read menus in dimly - lit restaurants or a newspaper or book while on the bus .
Some small practical devices become a staple of utility in your life .
I will never regift it , but would consider buying a few for future presents .
I know my colleagues and friends , even family , will enjoy it as much as I have .
It comes in handy when you least expect it .
Plus , who wants to carry around a giant flashlight .
Where do you put it ?
I suppose in your backpack , but frankly mine is already full what with my wallet , keys , cell phone , bottled water , and appointment book .
I have dark glasses , sometimes a snack , and a dictionary .
Thank you , professor , you were a good mentor and friend .
It is hard to say goodbye .
You made me enjoy your teaching subject and I will retain the information no doubt for life .
Why are we asking this now ?
Yesterday , the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs began reviewing scientific evidence on the classification of cannabis , amid widespread fears that Britain is in the grip of an epidemic of cannabis - induced psychosis .
This view is based on the belief that cannabis sold on the streets is stronger than it was a generation ago and is tipping vulnerable people into mental illness , including schizophrenia .
The review , the second in two years , was ordered by Gordon Brown , who has indicated he is minded to reverse the decision of the former Home Secretary David Blunkett , who downgraded the drug from Class B to Class C in 2004 .
Mr Blunkett 's aim was to free up police time squandered on prosecuting users , but the Prime Minister is concerned that the move sent the wrong message to young people , who are now confused about drug laws .

What is skunk ?
It is the generic name given to potent strains of the cannabis plant containing the highest levels of the psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) .
The original skunk , a cross between the fast - growing Indica and the potent Sativa strains , is believed to have originated in the US and was so called because of its pungent smell .
Dutch growers have since refined and cross - bred the plants to produce a number of strains including super - skunk , Early Girl , Northern Lights and Jack Herer .
They are normally grown indoors under lights , or in a greenhouse .
The more intensive the cultivation , the higher the THC content .
How strong is skunk ?
Traditional herbal cannabis contains 2 to 4 per cent THC , according to the Drugscope charity .
More potent varieties average 10 to 14 per cent – three to four times as strong .
Claims that skunk is 20 to 30 times as powerful as herbal cannabis are exaggerated .
A European review of cannabis potency in June 2004 concluded that the overall potency of cannabis products on the market had not increased significantly because imported cannabis dominated the market in most countries .
However , as home - grown cannabis has become more widely available , especially in the Netherlands and Britain , consumption of stronger varieties has increased .
The Home Office yesterday claimed that 70 per cent of cannabis sold on the streets of Britain was skunk .
Why is skunk so popular ?
It offers a powerful high , similar for some users to that obtained with ecstasy or LSD but without the chemicals .
Even in the world of recreational drugs , users prefer a " natural " high .
It can be home - grown from legally obtainable seeds – many users grow a few plants on a windowsill for personal consumption .
It is easy to identify , making it difficult to fake .
Cannabis resin , by contrast , has been adulterated with everything from boot polish to the horse tranquilliser ketamine .
How dangerous is skunk ?
This is an area of intense dispute .
The greatest concern is over its effects on mental health .
When the advisory council last reviewed cannabis in early 2006 , it concluded that use of the drug by existing schizophrenia sufferers might worsen their symptoms and lead to a relapse in some .
But on causation , it said : " The evidence suggests , at worst , that using cannabis increases the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia by 1 per cent . "
Some scientists believe this underplays the risks .
Professor Robin Murray , of the Institute of Psychiatry in London , says that in vulnerable individuals – those with an unsuspected genetic predisposition to schizophrenia – cannabis may be the trigger that starts a full - blown mental illness .
His research showed that up to 10 per cent of the adult population – or about four million people – are prone to paranoid thoughts or grandiose ideas and , among those who smoke cannabis regularly , half may be tipped into psychotic delusions and end up needing treatment .
The early age at which people start smoking the drug today , compared with two or three decades ago , is an additional concern , he says , because their brains may be more vulnerable .
Have the risks been overstated ?
Yes .
A recent report , printed in several newspapers last month , suggested that 500 people a week were being admitted to hospital for treatment for the effects of cannabis – a 50 per cent increase since the drug was downgraded to Class C in 2004 .
The figure was repeated in reports this week .
Drugscope said the figure , quoted by the Public Health minister Dawn Primarolo , was actually related to the number of people consulting community drug treatment services for help or advice where " treatment " may amount to no more than an informal chat .
The actual figure for hospital admissions was 14 per week in 2006 - 07 – and that was lower than the year before .
So why did the advisory council recommend that cannabis remains a Class C drug ?
Because , despite the evidence of a link with schizophrenia , it concluded that cannabis remained " substantially " less harmful than the Class B drugs amphetamines and barbiturates .
The classification of drugs is , in part , about proportionality .
Experts have long argued that the current system for ranking drugs – Class A for the most dangerous to Class C for the least dangerous – is irrational .
In terms of harm caused , alcohol and tobacco are more dangerous than cannabis , yet they are legal and cannabis is illegal .
Defenders of the 2004 decision to downgrade cannabis to Class C say that it has not increased its use and it has freed police to tackle drug - dealers and other more serious crimes .
Since 2004 , consumption of cannabis has actually declined .
Are there other risks from skunk ?
Yes – but they are small .
Skunk is smoked like cannabis , contains carcinogenic substances and is often mixed with tobacco .
The British Lung Foundation estimated that smoking three joints was equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes but most users give up after a few years .
Some experts also believe there is a risk of dependence among regular smokers .
However , cannabis is not seen as a drug of addiction like heroin or tobacco .
The greatest fear , alongside its effect on mental health , is that skunk may lead people on to use harder drugs .
It is certainly true that many people who become heroin addicts have used cannabis in the past .
But the vast majority of cannabis users never progress to heroin .
Research by the Home Office concluded that the so - called " gateway effect " of cannabis – leading users on to harder drugs – was probably " very small " .
Should the newer , more potent forms of cannabis be re-classified ?
Yes ...
* Vulnerable individuals with a predisposition to mental illness may be tipped into psychosis by the drug
* The younger age at which people start smoking means their brains are more vulnerable
* Skunk cannabis is three to four times stronger than herbal cannabis and has more potent effects
No ...
* At worst , the experts say , the use of cannabis increases the lifetime risk of schizophrenia by only 1 per cent
* The chances that users of skunk will progress to harder drugs such as heroin are very small
* Skunk is safer than alcohol and tobacco , which are legal and cause more than 100,000 deaths a year
The Scientology Handbook
Scientology fundamentals for daily use in every part of life .
Encompassing 19 separate bodies of technology , here is the most comprehensive manual ever published on the basics of life .
Drugs and Their Effects on the Mind
Drugs essentially are poisons .
The degree they are taken determines the effect .
A small amount gives a stimulant ( increases activity ) .
A greater amount acts as a sedative ( suppresses activity ) .
A larger amount acts as a poison and can kill one .
This is true of any drug .
Each requires a different amount .
Caffeine is a drug , so coffee is an example .
One hundred cups of coffee would probably kill a person .
Ten cups would probably put him to sleep .
Two or three cups stimulates .
This is a very common drug .
It is not very harmful as it takes so much of it to have an effect .
So it is known as a stimulant .
Arsenic is known as a poison .
Yet a tiny amount of arsenic is a stimulant , a good - sized dose puts one to sleep and a few grains kills one .
But there are many drugs which have another liability : they directly affect the mind .
In order to have a good understanding of the mental effects of drugs , it is necessary to know something about what the mind is .
The mind is not a brain .
It is the accumulated recordings of thoughts , conclusions , decisions , observations and perceptions of a person throughout his entire existence .
In Scientology it has been discovered that the mind is a communication and control system between a thetan and his environment .
By thetan is meant the person himself , the spiritual being – not his body or his name , the physical universe , his mind , or anything else .
The most obvious portion of the mind is recognizable by anyone not in serious condition .
This is the mental image picture .
Various phenomena connect themselves with this entity called the mind .
Some people closing their eyes see only blackness , some people see pictures .
The mind is a communication and control system between a thetan and his environment .
The mind is not a brain .
The thetan receives , by the communication system called the mind , various impressions , including direct views of the physical universe .
In addition to this he receives impressions from past activities and , most important , he himself conceives things about the past and future which are independent of immediately present stimuli .
A person who has taken drugs , in addition to the physical factors involved , retains mental image pictures of those drugs and their effects .
Mental image pictures are three - dimensional color pictures with sound and smell and all other perceptions , plus the conclusions or speculations of the individual .
They are mental copies of one ’s perceptions sometime in the past , although in cases of unconsciousness or lessened consciousness they exist below the individual ’s awareness .
For example , a person who had taken LSD would retain “ pictures ” of that experience in his mind , complete with recordings of the sights , physical sensations , smells , sounds , etc. , that occurred while he was under the influence of LSD .
Let us say an individual took LSD one day while at a fairground with some friends , and the day ’s experiences included feeling nauseated and dizzy , getting into an argument with a friend , feeling an emotion of sadness , and later feeling very tired .
He would have mental image pictures of that entire incident .
At a later time , if this person ’s environment were to contain enough similarities to the elements in that past incident , he may experience a reactivation of that incident .
As a result he could feel nauseated , dizzy , sad and very tired – all for no apparent reason .
This is known as restimulation : the reactivation of a past memory due to similar circumstances in the present approximating circumstances of the past .
Such mental image pictures can also be reactivated by drug residuals , as the presence of these drugs in the tissues of the body can simulate the earlier drug experiences .
Using the above example of the person who took LSD , sometime later – perhaps years afterward – the residuals of the drug that are still in his body tissues can cause a restimulation of that LSD incident .
The mental image pictures are reactivated , and he experiences the same sensations of nausea , dizziness and tiredness , and he feels sad .
He does not know why .
He might also perceive mental images of the persons he was with and the accompanying sights and sounds and smells .
These are the effects on the mind of past drug usage .
However , the current use of drugs creates a similar and more immediate effect on the mind .
When a person uses a drug such as marijuana , peyote , opium , morphine or heroin , mental image pictures of past times can “ turn on ” or restimulate below the individual ’s conscious awareness , causing him to perceive something different than what is actually going on .
Thus , right there before your eyes , apparently in the same room as you are , doing the same things , the drug - taker is really only partially there and partially in some past events .
He seems to be there .
Really he is n’t “ tracking ” fully with present time .
What is going on to a rational observation is not what is going on to him .
Thus , he does not understand statements made by another but tries to fit them into his composite reality , meaning a reality made up of different components .
In order to fit them in , he has to alter them .
Drugs affect the mind by reactivating incidents from a person ’s past , below his conscious awareness .
This can distort the drug user ’s perception of what is happening around him .
As a result , the person ’s actions may appear very odd or irrational .
For example , a drug user may be sure he is helping one repair a floor that needs fixing , but in fact he is hindering the actual operation in progress which consists of cleaning the floor .
So when he “ helps one ” mop the floor , he introduces chaos into the activity .
Since he is repairing the floor , a request to “ give me the mop ” has to be reinterpreted as “ hand me the hammer . ”
But the mop handle is longer than a hammer handle so the bucket gets upset .
This can be slight , wherein the person is seen to make occasional mistakes .
It can be as serious as total insanity where the events apparent to him are completely different than those apparent to anyone else .
And it can be all grades in between .
It is not that he does n’t know what is going on .
It is that he perceives something else going on instead of the present sequence of events .
Thus , others appear to him to be stupid or unreasonable or insane .
As they do n’t agree in their actions and orders with what he plainly sees is in progress , “ they ” are n’t sensible .
Example : A group is moving furniture .
To all but one they are simply moving furniture .
This one perceives himself to be “ moving geometric shapes into a cloud . ”
Thus , this one “ makes mistakes . ”
As the group does n’t see inside him and only sees another like themselves , they ca n’t figure out why he “ balls things up so . ”
Such persons as drug - takers and the insane are thus slightly or wholly on an apparently different time track of “ present time ” events .
A drug may be taken to drive a person out of an unbearable present time or out of consciousness altogether .
In some persons they do not afterwards return wholly to present time .
A thetan can also escape an unbearable present time by dropping into the past , even without drugs .
The drug - taker and the insane alike have not recovered present time , to a greater or lesser degree .
Thus they think they are running on a different time track than they are .
These are the underlying facts in odd human behavior .
As what is going on according to the perception and subjective reality of such a person is varied in greater or lesser degree from the objective reality of others , such a person disturbs the environment and disrupts the smooth running of any group – from family to business to nation .
We have all known such a person , so it is not uncommon in the current civilization .
The sudden remark which makes no sense , totally out of context with what is being spoken about ; the blank stare when given an order or remark – behind these lies a whole imaginary world which is jarred by our attempts to get something done in present time .
The repercussions of drugs then , go far beyond their immediate effects and often influence many others besides the user .
The consequences can be very harmful .
This is true not only of illegal street drugs but also of medical drugs that are supposed to help people .
Of the 92 naturally occurring elements , add another to the list of those that are superconductors .
James S. Schilling , Ph.D. , professor of physics in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis , and Mathew Debessai , Ph.D. , — his doctoral student at the time — discovered that europium becomes superconducting at 1.8 K ( - 456 °F ) and 80 GPa ( 790,000 atmospheres ) of pressure , making it the 53rd known elemental superconductor and the 23rd at high pressure .
Debessai , who received his doctorate in physics at Washington University ’s Commencement May 15 , 2009 , is now a postdoctoral research associate at Washington State University .
“ It has been seven years since someone discovered a new elemental superconductor , ” Schilling said .
“ It gets harder and harder because there are fewer elements left in the periodic table . ”
This discovery adds data to help improve scientists ’ theoretical understanding of superconductivity , which could lead to the design of room - temperature superconductors that could be used for efficient energy transport and storage .
The results are published in the May 15 , 2009 , issue of Physical Review Letters in an article titled “ Pressure - induced Superconducting State of Europium Metal at Low Temperatures . ”
Schilling ’s research is supported by a four - year $ 500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation , Division of Materials Research .
Europium belongs to a group of elements called the rare earth elements .
These elements are magnetic ; therefore , they are not superconductors .
“ Superconductivity and magnetism hate each other .
To get superconductivity , you have to kill the magnetism , ” Schilling explained .
Of the rare earths , europium is most likely to lose its magnetism under high pressures due to its electronic structure .
In an elemental solid almost all rare earths are trivalent , which means that each atom releases three electrons to conduct electricity .
“ However , when europium atoms condense to form a solid , only two electrons per atom are released and europium remains magnetic .
Applying sufficient pressure squeezes a third electron out and europium metal becomes trivalent .
Trivalent europium is nonmagnetic , thus opening the possibility for it to become superconducting under the right conditions , ” Schilling said .
Schilling uses a diamond anvil cell to generate such high pressures on a sample .
A circular metal gasket separates two opposing 0.17 - carat diamond anvils with faces ( culets ) 0.18 mm in diameter .
The sample is placed in a small hole in the gasket , flanked by the faces of the diamond anvils .
Pressure is applied to the sample space by inflating a doughnut - like bellow with helium gas .
Much like a woman in stilettos exerts more pressure on the ground than an elephant does because the woman ’s force is spread over a smaller area , a small amount of helium gas pressure ( 60 atmospheres ) creates a large force ( 1.5 tons ) on the tiny sample space , thus generating extremely high pressures on the sample .
Unique electrical , magnetic properties
Superconducting materials have unique electrical and magnetic properties .
They have no electrical resistance , so current will flow through them forever , and they are diamagnetic , meaning that a magnet held above them will levitate .
These properties can be exploited to create powerful magnets for medical imaging , make power lines that transport electricity efficiently or make efficient power generators .
However , there are no known materials that are superconductors at room temperature and pressure .
All known superconducting materials have to be cooled to extreme temperatures and / or compressed at high pressure .
“ At ambient pressure , the highest temperature at which a material becomes superconducting is 134 K ( - 218 °F ) .
This material is complex because it is a mixture of five different elements .
We do not understand why it is such a good superconductor , ” Schilling said .
Scientists do not have enough theoretical understanding to be able to design a combination of elements that will be superconductors at room temperature and pressure .
Schilling ’s result provides more data to help refine current theoretical models of superconductivity .
“ Theoretically , the elemental solids are relatively easy to understand because they only contain one kind of atom , ” Schilling said .
“ By applying pressure , however , we can bring the elemental solids into new regimes , where theory has difficulty understanding things .
“ When we understand the element ’s behavior in these new regimes , we might be able to duplicate it by combining the elements into different compounds that superconduct at higher temperatures . ”
Schilling will present his findings at the 22nd biennial International Conference on High Pressure Science and Technology in July 2009 in Tokyo , Japan .
New Core i7 processors from Intel have surfaced on retail sites , giving early details of the new Nehalem - based processors ahead of the company 's official launch of the chips .
Multiple retail sites on Wednesday were taking orders for two quad - core Core i7 chips , which are targeted at high - end desktops and workstations .
The chips are scheduled for a May 31 launch , according to one Web - based retailer , PCs For Everyone .
[ Earlier this month , Intel announced it will stop selling the 2.93GHz Core i7 940 chip this year . ]
The new chips include what could be the fastest Core i7 processor to date .
The quad - core Core i7 Extreme 975 runs at 3.33 GHz , with 8 MB of shared L3 cache .
It is priced at US $ 1,129 on PCs For Everyone .
Other sites , including Provantage price the processor between $ 1,100 and $ 1,250 .
The new processor will overtake the existing Core i7 965 chip as the fastest Core i7 processor .
The second new i7 chip is the Core i7 950 , which runs at 3.06GHz and includes 8 MB of shared L3 cache .
It is priced at $ 649 on PCs For Everyone .
The chip could possibly replace the Core i7 940 processor , which Intel plans to discontinue .
Core i7 chips are based on Intel 's Nehalem microarchitecture and integrate a memory controller on the CPU , which gives the chip a faster path to communicate with the memory .
The chip also includes technologies like QuickPath Interconnect that makes communication between CPU and system components faster .
Intel could ultimately replace the Core i7 chips in early 2010 with desktop chips code - named Gulftown .
The new chips will be made using the 32 - nanometer manufacturing process , which could make it speedier and more power efficient than Core i7 chips .
The Gulftown chips will be part of Intel 's upcoming Westmere family of 32 - nm processors .
Intel officials did n't immediately reply to a request for comment .
When we say eco-friendly vehicles , we have heard a lot about electric cars , bicycles and more .
Student designer Anton Grimes joined the Australian Design Awards and presented his eco-friendly design called the Link Urban Scooter System .
The Scooter itself may not be unique at all , but the concept of using it at the Central Business District of Australia made the Link Urban Scooter System Unique .
This cute vehicle can be retrofitted to any existing Streetscape Smart Poles wherein users are allowed to hire one from a hub and return it to another hub where the scooter will be recharged .
It will not only reduce carbon emission , but reduces the need of space eating parking lot as well .
I just wish that this would be comfortable for use on any weather .

McAfee has launched a new website designed to help the victims of various cybercrimes fight back against Internet deviants .
Dubbed the " Cybercrime Response Unit , " it acts a lot like an " Online 911 " .
A victim of an online hacking is left with very little options following an attack .
On one hand , the thought of calling the police to report a random computer virus is comical , but if the virus is comprehensive enough that it affects a great number of people , the party responsible for its creation should be held accountable .
In the U.S. , online crimes can be prosecuted by state , local and federal authorities , including the FBI and the Secret Service , but sometimes the justice system is a bit intimidating for the average end - user to pursue .
Online 911
The McAfee Cybercrime Response Unit is a kind of like an " Online 911 " where people can go to check the severity of their damages , and if need be , get in contact with the proper authorities .
The site could be the difference in recognizing a Conficker attack over a harmless ( albeit annoying ) malware bug .
Even if your computer has not been targeted , the website provides a wealth of information about Internet scams , online bullying , identity theft and other random acts of cybercrime .
McAfee Recommends Online Scan
McAfee recognizes that a great number of victimized people do not even realize that their computer has been jeopardized .
In this respect , McAfee recommends an online scanning program that will check the computer for any signs of supposed cybercriminal activity .
The scanning program is exclusive to Internet Explorer and / or Windows users for the time being .

Complaints Up , Actual Cybercrime Figures Unknown
According to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ) Internet Crime Complaint Center , people complained about Internet - related crimes 33 % more often than in the previous year .
( Source : networkworld.com )
While the exact number of Internet - related crimes changes on an hourly basis , the figure above shows that people are becoming much more aware of threats online .
If this data holds true , expect the McAfee " Online 911 " system to attract many new visitors in the near future .
This analogy is n’t close to being complete .
And it does n’t match up at every point .
But where it does connect , it ’s so spot - on that I must share it with you .
In former Banana Republics , in their post - transition - to - democracy phases , you ’ll often have a Junta Party .
It ’s an opposition party whose main goal is n’t to get elected so much as to maintain the legacy of the former junta regime , defend its record of service to the state and most of all keep its former leaders from being put on trial or shipped off to the Hague .
Often the party will be headed up by the former Generals themselves .
But if they ’re dead or otherwise occupied in the slammer or abroad , maybe you ’ll have their relatives or the one - time cronies and lickspittles of this or that el jefe of the old regime filling the leadership roles .
And today , as we watched the on - going parade of Cliff Mays on TV or Dan Burton praising waterboarding as essential to the American dream , Eric Kleefeld pointed out to me that that really is pretty much the role the GOP — at least for the moment — has taken in our present politics .
Yes , Republicans have tried to distance themselves from President Bush ’s fiscal profligacy .
But on the core value issues of militarism and human rights violations and keeping faith with the war criminals of the previous regime they really could n’t be more unified or on message .
If you were plopped down on earth today in front of a TV set in the United States , on the testimony of the party members themselves , you might easily get the idea that state - sanctioned torture was the main policy legacy of the outgoing administration .
Sort of like Democrats looked back on late 90s budget surpluses with a proud defiance in the aftermath of the Clinton years .
I ca n’t be the only one who this resonates with .
Who else has some examples ?

Taliban warn of new operations
A Taliban spokesman warned Wednesday of a new insurgent operation targeting the expected increase in American and international forces in Afghanistan .

There are around 70,000 troops in Afghanistan operating under NATO and U.S. command .
U.S. President Barack Obama unveiled a new strategy for Afghanistan earlier this year , calling for an increase in military troops and trainers to tackle al - Qaida and Taliban militants .
NATO pledged additional forces to help provide security as Afghanistan prepares for presidential elections in August .
A Taliban spokesman told media officials Wednesday they would launch Operation Nasrat on Tuesday in an effort to target Western - backed Afghan leaders and coordinate suicide bombings and other attacks , the Pakistani daily Dawn reports .
The spokesman , Zabihullah Mujahid , said Afghans needed Taliban support to defend themselves and their country from foreign occupation .
The statement warned that fighters loyal to the Taliban would target diplomatic missions and officials with the " puppet government " as well as official buildings and vulnerable supply routes .
Taliban leaders have made similar statements in the past , though most military officials have discounted their claims .
The latest warning , however , comes as violence in Afghanistan is expected to increase as the weather improves .
Obama meets opposition to Afghan strategy
U.S. President Barack Obama was forced to defend his multibillion - dollar strategy for Afghanistan to lawmakers on Capitol Hill worried over a lack of metrics .
Obama unveiled a sweeping agenda for the war effort in Afghanistan that includes a modest troop surge , renewed focus on al - Qaida and non-military aid to Pakistan .
Critics of the Obama strategy say the plan lacks a variety of benchmarks , including a timeline for troop withdrawal .

Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D - Calif. , the co-chair of liberal Congressional Progressive Caucus , expressed criticism over the lack of an exit strategy , The Washington Post reports .
" We said , ' We need timelines , ' " Woolsey said .
Lawmakers in the caucus also raised objections to the $ 83 billion price tag for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , slated for a May vote .
Caucus members complained the war funding focused too much on military solutions and not enough on diplomatic efforts in Afghanistan .
Obama , however , urged patience , saying the strategy needs time to unfold .
Despite modest public support for Obama 's strategy in Afghanistan , however , several of the lawmakers said they would vote against the supplemental spending request .
Unity needed in Afghan reform strategy
The European Union needs to boost its commitment and improve multilateral coordination to reform the justice system in Afghanistan effectively , a study showed .
Limited resources in the sector of police reform coupled with a lack of coordination are inhibiting the effectiveness of the EU Police Mission in Afghanistan , a study by the EU Institute for Security Studies found .
The report noted that internal constraints have translated to a bilateral effort toward police and justice reform in Afghanistan , notably in the German and Italian efforts , where a multilateral approach would prove more efficient .
Several government and international agencies have expressed concern that the coordinated mission in Afghanistan is lacking transparency and joint cooperation .
The report noted that only through increasing available resources and coordinating joint strategies can the EU make an effective contribution to reform in Afghanistan .

It went on to say that the EU police mission is " far below " its necessary mission strength and suffers from insufficient expertise in its existing staff .
By acting in unison , the report said , the EU can develop a coordinated strategy with the international community working in Afghanistan to carry out justice and police reform .
Campaigning under way in Iraqi Kurdistan
Campaigning for the Kurdish provincial elections began Wednesday with 42 parties , including minority groups , contesting for 111 seats available in the region .
Iraq held elections in January for 14 of its 18 provinces .
The Kurdish provinces -- Erbil , Dahuk and Sulaimaniya -- and Kirkuk delayed their elections because of territorial and administrative disputes .
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , the head of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , and Massoud Barzani , the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party and president of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq , announced in early April they would compete on a unified ticket .
Three parties are vying for five Turkmen seats in the Kurdish elections while four candidates are competing for the sole Armenian seat , the Iraqi bureau of Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty reports .
Five seats are available for the Chaldean and Assyrian sects of Christianity as well .
Talabani , meanwhile , has renominated himself as the head of the PUK , saying all leaders in the party support his continued leadership .
The date for the elections in Iraqi Kurdistan was tentatively set for May 19 , though the official date remains uncertain .
Officials with the Independent High Electoral Commission of Iraq said they expected an announcement on the official date from Kurdish officials within days , though the Voices of Iraq news agency mentions a July election .

Arabs , Turkmens outraged at Kirkuk petition
A petition circulated by pro-Kurdish groups to annex Kirkuk into Iraqi Kurdistan was met with outrage by members of rival ethnic communities in northern Iraq .
Kirkuk falls within the so - called disputed territories of Iraq , where the administrative authority lies at the center of disputes between the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq and the central government in Baghdad .
Petition organizers said they received support from around 80,000 residents in Kirkuk , notably from members of the Arab , Assyrian Christian , Kurdish and Turkmen groups .
The United Nations and Iraqi authorities are reviewing whether Kirkuk should be divided along ethnic lines or obtain special status .
The latest report from the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq calls for a unified Kirkuk , however .
Arab and Turkmen provincial leaders , meanwhile , reacted to the petition with outrage , blaming its support on the " terror and intimidation " tactics employed by the Kurdish paramilitary force , the Asayish , the Iraqi analytical Web site Niqash.org reports .
Opponents added that the status of Kirkuk is not a matter for non-governmental organizations to decide .
Turkmen provincial council leader Ali Mahdi lashed out at the measure , saying if the petition drive continues , " we will defend ourselves with all possible means . "
Journalist murder - plot trial to begin in Iraq
The Committee to Protect Journalists called on prosecutors to hold a transparent trial for the first - ever case involving a plot to kill an Iraqi journalist .
CPJ said it is following a pending case involving two suspects charged with plotting to kill Ahmed Mira , the editor in chief of Iraqi magazine Livin , based in Sulaimaniya .

" We call on the authorities to ensure that this trial is fair and public , " said Mohamed Abdel Dayem , a CPJ program coordinator .
" It is vital that the trial is conducted properly and transparently so that it can set a precedent for future legal proceedings against others who have murdered journalists in Iraq . "
The trial was expected to begin Wednesday for two suspects charged with the plot .
A third person is under investigation .
CPJ said members of the Kurdish paramilitary force , Asayish , informed Livin officials of the plot in September .
The two suspects facing trial were arrested in October .
A Livin reporter , Soran Mama Hama , was killed in July by unidentified gunmen in Kirkuk following a series of published reports critical of the local government .
Kirkuk officials said they are investigating the murder but have not filed any charges .
CPJ said 88 of the 138 journalists killed in Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 were murdered .
The Mira case is the first examining a plot to kill an Iraqi journalist .

Raúl Alfonsín , whose presidency in the 1980s symbolized the return of democracy in Argentina and other Latin American nations after an era of military dictatorships , died Tuesday at his home in Buenos Aires .
He was 82 .
The cause was lung cancer , said Dr. Alberto Sadler , who had been treating Mr. Alfonsín .
A passionate voice for human rights , Mr. Alfonsín governed from 1983 to 1989 , a time of upheaval that included three failed military coups , hyperinflation and food riots .
He won praise for prosecuting the military dictators who had preceded him in office .
His government ’s inability to manage a sinking economy led him to step down several months before his term was to end , but he remained a respected and influential political figure .
When he handed over power to Carlos Saúl Menem , it was the first time in 61 years that an elected Argentine president had been succeeded by an elected president from a different political party .
“ My inspiration comes from an ethic , rather than an ideology , ” Mr. Alfonsín once said in an interview , “ an ethic that believes in the freedom of man . ”
He liked to call himself “ the most humble Argentine , ” and his rumpled suits and shabby trench coat became his trademarks .
The 53ft , three - masted junk was built over six years by 30 traditional Chinese shipwrights in Fujian , southeast China using axes , chisels and models of the early Qing Dynasty ( 1644-1912 ) .
" We built it from the descriptions in an official Qing manuscript , right down to the handmade nails .
It was a small warship , probably used for coastal voyages , and it would have carried 30 soldiers and a crew .
This week ’s New Yorker has a fascinating article about the growing use of “ neuro - enhancing ” drugs by college students and others to improve focus , reduce sleep needs and lengthen study time and work hours .
Drugs like Adderall and Ritalin , typically prescribed to improve focus of people with attention deficit problems , now are being taken by people with healthy brains to help them boost achievement .
One doctor has even coined a term for the practice : cosmetic neurology .
Author Margaret Talbot writes :
A young man I ’ll call Alex recently graduated from Harvard .
As a history major , Alex wrote about a dozen papers a semester .
He also ran a student organization , for which he often worked more than forty hours a week ; when he was n’t on the job , he had classes .
Weeknights were devoted to all the schoolwork that he could n’t finish during the day , and weekend nights were spent drinking with friends and going to dance parties .
… Since , in essence , this life was impossible , Alex began taking Adderall to make it possible .
Adderall , a stimulant composed of mixed amphetamine salts , is commonly prescribed for children and adults who have been given a diagnosis of attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder .
But in recent years Adderall and Ritalin , another stimulant , have been adopted as cognitive enhancers : drugs that high - functioning , overcommitted people take to become higher - functioning and more overcommitted ….
College campuses have become laboratories for experimentation with neuroenhancement .

Kristen Lewis and Sarah Burd - Sharps are co-directors of the American Human Development Project .
America experienced great progress in human well - being in the last half century .
A baby born in 2005 will live , on average , eight years longer than one born in 1960 .
High school completion rates have doubled , and the percentage of college graduates has almost quadrupled .
The typical American earned almost twice as much in 2005 as in 1960 ( in 2005 dollars ) .
But these averages – as averages are wont to do – hide a world of variation , as well as just how much certain groups have been left behind in that path toward progress .
Manhattan ’s East Side and the South Bronx , for example , are five subway stops and little more than two miles apart , but going from one neighborhood to the other is a trip back in time in terms of human development .
Recent Economix posts have referred to the work of the American Human Development Project in discussions centering on the value of the human development index .
The folks at Economix have kindly given us an opportunity to share some of our findings .
In 2008 , we constructed a first - ever American Human Development Index to assess the relative well - being of different groups of Americans .
Our index is not comparable to the global Human Development Index produced by the U.N. Development Program , a measure that looks at the social and economic development of different countries .
The U.N. index , which is rooted in the work of the Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen , was , however , the model for our index .
The American Human Development Index combines official American government data on health , education and income into a single , composite measure .
Health is measured by life expectancy ; education by a combination of educational attainment and school enrollment ; and income by median personal earnings ( wages and salaries ) .
The value of having a single number is that it allows for methodologically sound yet easily understood comparisons among different population groups .
We ranked the American population in terms of well - being by state , by congressional district , by the five major racial / ethnic categories of the Census Bureau , and by gender .
In addition , using the same indicators , we calculated a historic index for the country as a whole for every decade from 1960 onwards .
What did we find ?
In the state index , Connecticut was at the top and Mississippi was at the bottom .
While their ranks may not surprise you – is n’t Mississippi always at the bottom of these sorts of lists ?
– the size of the gap might .
Connecticut has an H.D. index of 6.37 ( on a scale of 0 to 10 ) , which , if current trends continue , will be the average of America as a whole in the year 2020 .
Mississippi , on the other hand , has an H.D. index ( 3.58 ) lower than that of the whole country some 20 years ago .
Nearly three decades , a generation of progress , separate the two states .
In terms of health , African - Americans today have a lifespan shorter than the average American in the late 1970s , three decades ago .
African - American men live shorter lives today than the average American in 1960 .
The life expectancy today in Kentucky ’s 5th District ( the southeastern part of the state ) is below that of the United States as a whole 30 years ago .
When it comes to education , the percentage of the adult population in Texas ’s 29th District ( the Houston area ) that did not complete high school — close to half — is at about the level of the United States average in the mid-1960s .
Nationwide , Latinos have the lowest ranking for education — roughly 40 percent of Latinos age 25 and up do n’t have a high school diploma , about the same rate as America as a whole in the mid-1970s .
Looking at income , our index shows that Latina women earn , on average , about $ 16,000 , compared to white and Asian - American men , who earn about $ 37,000 .
Taking another look at Mississippi , we see that not everyone in the state is struggling .
White men earn about $ 5,000 more than the typical American worker today — but white women earn the same wage as an average American in 1980 , African - American men earn 1970 wages , and African - American women pre-1960 wages .
As for our original example , that of the East Side versus the Bronx , it seems the East Side is ahead of its time .
Given the historic growth pattern from 1960 to 2005 , the United States as a whole wo n’t have levels of well - being typical of the East Side today until 2041 , whereas residents of the South Bronx have levels of health , education and income typical of Americans in the mid-1980s .
On average , a resident of Manhattan ’s 14th Congressional District ( the East Side ) earns two and a half times as much , lives four years longer , and is seven times more likely to have a college degree than a resident of the 16th District ( the South Bronx ) .
Human development is about what ordinary people can do and what they can become , about the liberty they have to exercise real choice in their lives .
For most Americans , the last half - century has brought greater freedom , opportunity and well - being .
But the American Human Development Index tells us that huge segments of society are being left out .
And it offers a tool to hold leaders accountable for investing in an infrastructure of opportunity that better serves the next generation .
Rep. Alcee L. Hastings , D - Fla .
Rep. Alcee L. Hastings , D - Fla. , has introduced to the House of Representatives a new bill , H.R. 645 , calling for the secretary of homeland security to establish no fewer than six national emergency centers for corralling civilians on military installations .
The proposed bill , which has received little mainstream media attention , appears designed to create the type of detention center that those concerned about use of the military in domestic affairs fear could be used as concentration camps for political dissidents , such as occurred in Nazi Germany .
Heed the warning of a former Hitler Youth who sees America on the same path as pre-Nazi Germany in " Defeating the Totalitarian Lie " from WND Books !
The bill also appears to expand the president 's emergency power , much as the executive order signed by President Bush on May 9 , 2007 , that , as WND reported , gave the president the authority to declare an emergency and take over the direction of all federal , state , local , territorial and tribal governments without even consulting Congress .
TRENDING : Alleged attacker behind carnage at pro-Trump event linked to ' Caravan 4 Justice ' group
As WND also reported , DHS has awarded a $ 385 million contract to Houston - based KBR , Halliburton 's former engineering and construction subsidiary , to build temporary detention centers on an " as- needed " basis in national emergency situations .
According to the text of the proposed bill , the purpose of the National Emergency Centers is " to provide temporary housing , medical , and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster . "
Three additional purposes are specified in the text of the proposed legislation :
To provide centralized locations for the purposes of training and ensuring the coordination of federal , state and local first responders ;
To provide centralized locations to improve the coordination of preparedness , response and recovery efforts of government , private , not - for - profit entities and faith - based organizations ;
To meet other appropriate needs , as defined by the secretary of homeland security .
The broad specifications of the bill 's language , however , contribute to concern that the " national emergency " purpose could be utilized by the secretary of homeland security to include any kind of situation the government wants to contain or otherwise control .
Rep .
Hastings created controversy during the 2008 presidential campaign with his provocative comments concerning Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
" If Sarah Palin is n't enough of a reason for you to get over whatever your problem is with Barack Obama , then you damn well had better pay attention , " Hastings said , as reported by ABC News .
" Anybody toting guns and stripping moose do n't care too much about what they do with Jews and blacks .
So , you just think this through . "
H.R. 645 , which seeks to allocate $ 360 million for developing the emergency centers , has been referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and to the Committee on Armed Services .

Students from Appalachian State University figured out how to make working bicycles out of recycled plastic bottles .
Image from 2one2Design.com .
A friend of mine from high school was part of the winning team that took home the grand prize for the first annual Juicy Ideas Competition , sponsored by Google , for his and his teammates ’ innovative and environmentally responsible bicycle design .
Squeezing Ideas out of a Throw - Away Item
Google Student Blog
March 2 , 2009
How would you define innovation ?
Environmentalism ?
Or entrepreneurship ?
The Juicy Ideas Competition asked college students to demonstrate all three .
Attracting nearly 900 college students from roughly 30 schools , The Juicy Ideas Competition asked students to create an innovative product out of a “ throw - away ” item .
They were then asked to post a video that illustrated these three factors and post it to YouTube .
Videos poured in from all over the country – we saw everything from blankets made out of plastic bags to coffee tables made out of Gatorade bottles .
But none of the ideas stood out as much as the four students from Appalachian State University in North Carolina .
Spencer Price , Ryan Klinger , Andrew Drake , and Justin Henry created a working bicycle out of used water bottles to win the Juicy Ideas grand prize trip to the Google Headquarters in Mountain View .
At the famed Googleplex , the guys not only got to ride around on the whimsical conference bike ( there are pictures on Facebook to prove it ! ) , but they also presented their winning video and its “ version 2.0 ” ( about how to make the plan a reality ) to a group of Google employees .
Watch their 30 - minute presentation to Googlers here .
THE CONCEPT :
Plastic bottles are an abundant recyclable material .
Bicycling is an economic and eco-friendly mode of transportation .
Merge the two together and you create a self - sustainable business model that turns trash into treasure in the form of affordable , carbon - reducing community bikes .
The completely recyclable plastic ( polyethylene ) bicycle frames are created from a mold , which reduces production and labor costs .
The plastic bikes are also one - eighth the weight of regular steel bikes .
And finally , they help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions , compared to motorized transport .
WATCH THE TEAM’S WINNING VIDEO :

Welcome back to the ancient Chinese story blog everybody .
Today ’s old Chinese story is very famous and I will be translating myself from Chinese Bai Hua into English .
It is a rather old story that shows us something about Chinese culture ; the emphasis of hard work .
It shows us that the ancient Chinese just like their descendants today work very hard , but there is another moral to this tale as well .
Work on something that is feasible , be passionate in your field , and anything is possible .
Today ’s ancient Chinese stories ’ story is 愚公移山 ( yu gong yi shan ) 。When translated from Chinese to English , the story title is The Foolish Old Man Moves The Mountain .
I will leave his name as Yu Gong for my translation of the tale today .
I wish I could give you some more background on the story but sadly I never found the history of this ancient tale .
Just a note , I will be translating only a part of today ’s ancient Chinese tale because I found out unfortunately that the textbook I have only has part of it in it .
— — —-
Once upon a time there was an old man named Yu Gong , and he was almost 90 years old .
In front of the entrance to his home was two big mountains , for his family , it was very inconvenient for his family to come and go .
One day , Yu Gong said to his family , “ These two mountains in front of the entrance , they are just too inconvenient .
Why not get rid of these mountains ? ”
His son and grandson heard this and then said right after , “ What you say is true , tomorrow we shall start to do it ! ”
His wife felt it was too difficult to move a mountain and said , “ Do you guys see how tall those mountains are ?
How can you guys move such large mountains ?
And where will you put so many rocks and stones ? ”
They all replied , “ We only need to work hard , and then we most certainly shall be able to move those mountains .
We can take all the stones on the mountains and put them into the sea . ”
On the second day , Yu Gong and his family began to move the mountain .
His neighbor had children ; they heard they wanted to move the mountain , and together happily they went to move the mountain with them together .
They were n’t scared of strong winds , if it was raining , in summer they feared not heat , in winter they feared not the cold , and everyday they worked nonstop .
There was an old man named Zhi Sou ( 智叟 ；the wise old man ) who saw Yu Gong and his family at work moving the mountain .
He thought that this was ridiculous and said to Yu Gong , “ Now you are so old , and you are near the end of the road , is it really possible to move the mountains ? ”
Yu Gong replied , “ You still do n’t have a young intelligent grandson .
Even though I will die soon , I still have a so , when my son dies , I still shall have a grandson .
We will move the stones on the mountain little by little and it shall become smaller .
If we work everyday nonstop , why should we not be able to move this mountain ? ”
Zhi Sou heard this , and was speechless .
— — ——
On a sadder note , I believe this is only part of the text , from what my Chinese friends tell me .
The tale does end on a happy note for our dear Yu Gong .
The heavenly emperor heard about how hard Yu Gong was working and asked the mountain gods to move the mountains away .
Yu Gong in the end , proved that anything with determination could be done and embarrassed Zhi Sou .
Quite the ancient story indeed .
As I mentioned before , today ’s ancient story has a nice moral to the story ; work hard , and anything is possible .
It also shows how determined the people of Old China , the ancient Chinese and even today will work hard .
In a way , for the time this was written , that was pretty bold for any Chinese or anyone in the world at that time to say they could move a mountain .
On a note , the picture used in the Ancient Chinese Stories blog was taken in Xi An , and was at Yang Guifei ’s old bathing grounds .
If anyone has any nice pictures of Ancient Chinese sites , feel free to post them up .
Thank you to all the people also who comment and read my blog , glad to see there are still some interested in ancient cultures of any sort .
A big thanks to my friends also for seeing that the story was incomplete .
Patients who rely heavily on their religious faith to cope with terminal cancer are more likely to receive intensive life - prolonging measures in their last week of life , Boston researchers reported yesterday .
In a study at Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , Massachusetts General Hospital , and five other sites , 345 people with advanced cancer were interviewed about the importance of religion in dealing with their illness , and their preferences for care .
Most of them were Christian .
About 80 percent of the patients said they used religion to some extent to cope with their illness and more than half said they prayed , meditated , or engaged in religious study daily .
More than 30 percent said their faith was the most important thing that kept them going .
Patients also were asked if they would choose treatment intended to extend life as long as possible , even if it meant more pain , or if they wanted care that focused on easing pain even if it meant not living as long .
The researchers followed the patients to see what care they received in the week before their deaths .
The patients who leaned the most heavily on their faith were nearly three times more likely to choose and receive more aggressive care near death , such as ventilators or cardiopulmonary resuscitation .
They were less likely to have advanced care planning in place , such as do - not - resuscitate orders , living wills , and healthcare proxies .
" These results suggest that relying upon religion to cope with terminal cancer may contribute to receiving aggressive medical care near death , " the authors write in today 's Journal of the American Medical Association .
" Because aggressive end - of - life cancer care has been associated with poor quality of death . . . intensive end - of - life care might represent a negative outcome for religious copers . "
Dr. Andrea C. Phelps , the lead author and a senior medical resident at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , said previous research has shown a link between religious coping and preferences for " heroic " measures .
But this is the first study to focus on these patients ' final days .
" We need to better understand what factors of religiousness are involved in decision making , " she said in an interview .
The Rev. Angelika Zollfrank , a chaplain and the director of clinical pastoral education at Mass .
General , said she was surprised by the outcome of the study , in which she had no role .
" We certainly see religious patients and families go both ways in terms of religious coping , " she said in an e-mail interview .
" There are very religious people who want aggressive treatment , and there are also religious people who know that there is a time for everything , a time to be born and a time to die . "

Can states secede ?
There are three levels on which this question can be answered :
All three say yes .
The Inalienable Right of Secession
The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America invokes the self - evident truths that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , that governments are formed to protect these rights and gain their just powers from the consent of the governed , and that when a government becomes abusive of these rights , it is the right  no , it is the duty  of the people to alter or abolish that government .
To say governments were formed to protect the rights of men would be historically incorrect .
Almost all governments were formed by ruthless men exerting their will over others through the use of force .
Some governments , over time , evolved toward the rule of law , perhaps only because their rulers saw that this would sanction their own continued enjoyment of the wealth that they possessed .
In some instances , this evolution involved one or more " revolutions " in which those who were governed were able to better establish the rule of law .
The language of the Declaration should not be construed as an argument about the historical origins of government but , rather , as what would be true and just to an enlightened person , namely , that as persons and as communities of persons , we have the right and the duty to alter or abolish governments that become abusive of our rights .
As Benjamin Franklin once put it , " Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God . "
The concept of an inalienable right of secession was not original to the American Revolution .
It can be traced to the scholastics , to Reformation politics , and to the most ancient Greek and Hebrew writings .
Without going into a dissertation on the subject , let me simply point to the flag of the state of Virginia , which was designed by Thomas Jefferson .
It depicts a female warrior ( Athena ) standing atop a slain tyrant ( Zeus ) .

At least 18 people were killed today as India witnessed some of the worst electoral violence in its history on the first day of voting in month - long national elections .
Polling was peaceful in many areas but in a string of attacks across central and eastern states Maoist guerrillas attacked polling stations , seized electronic voting machines , kidnapped electoral officials and killed security personnel .
At least 18 people were killed and four election officials were kidnapped inside what is commonly referred to as the " red corridor " - a vast , desperately poor region extending across five states in which armed Maoist rebels , known as Naxalites , have waged a long - running insurgency .
The Naxalites had called for a boycott of the vote , and the threat of violence was an important reason for the national election commission 's decision to stagger the voting process .
Polling was conducted today in 124 of the 543 parliamentary constituencies and the final results will be announced on 16 May .
Voting for the remaining seats will take place during the next four weeks , primarily to facilitate the movement of paramilitary battalions guarding the elections from state to state .
More than 250,000 police have been deployed to provide security for the polls .
Apart from in pockets dominated by the Maoists , voters today turned out in significant numbers in most constituencies , varying from about 50 % to more than 85 % across states .
Re-polling was ordered in 17 polling booths as a result of the violence .
As millions cast their votes in one part of the country , campaigning began in other areas , though a more vigorous enforcement of laws that limit expenditure by candidates this time has made electioneering quieter and less colourful .
" The election commission has taken the fun out of the elections , " said political analyst Javed Ansari .
" The strength of India 's democracy comes from its participatory character - lots of meetings , heavy canvassing , posters , loudspeaker vans .
But candidates are now very cautious about spending money less they be debarred . "
He added : " India 's general elections are becoming like elections to the Oxford Union . "
The campaigning has been quieter in another way .
There have been fewer violent clashes between supporters of rival candidates .
But a new form of protest appears to have taken root .
In the third such incident in recent weeks , a party worker threw footwear at Lal Kishen Advani , the leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party and a prime ministerial hopeful .
The traditional wooden sandal missed its target and the thrower was taken away by the police from a meeting of BJP workers which Advani was to address in Madhya Pradesh state .
" You can not ask party workers to come barefoot to meetings , " said India Today 's editor , Prabhu Chawla , on a TV news channel .
" The BJP has to address their grievances . "
There was another source of excitement though for the Hindu nationalist BJP .
The supreme court ordered the release of one of its star candidates , Varun Gandhi , who was arrested after making a speech attacking Muslims while campaigning in his parliamentary constituency in the northern Uttar Pradesh state .
Varun is the estranged grandson of Indira Gandhi whose other grandson , Rahul , is a star campaigner for the ruling Congress .
The Congress and the BJP are locked in a struggle to emerge as the biggest party in this election .
The BJP is expected to use Gandhi for campaigning in Uttar Pradesh , a crucial state with 80 parliamentary seats .
" Opinion within the BJP is divided about Varun , " said Ansari .
" One section wants to use him to consolidate party votes .
But other leaders , including Advani , see him as too intemperate , and are wary of turning him into a big star . "
A study by Scripps Institute researchers predicts that even under conservative climate change scenarios , the Colorado River will not be able to supply water to meet the current demands 60 to 90 % of the time by the year 2050 .
Researchers also predicted that the reduction in the runoff feeding the river will mean shortages of 400,000 acre feet of Colorado River water 40 % of the time by 2025 .
“ People have talked for at least 30 years about the Colorado being oversubscribed but no one ever put a date on it or an amount .
That ’s what we ’ve done .
Without numbers like this , it ’s pretty hard for resource managers to know what to do . ” – Barnett
Millions of acres of farmland and tens of millions of people depend on water from the Colorado River system , and if human - caused climate change continues to increase drought severity , shortages would be a huge blow to the western United States .
Most shortfalls could be covered through water transfers and conservation efforts , but during dry years , the chance of substantial shortages is greatly increased .
“ Fortunately , we can avoid such big shortfalls if the river ’s users agree on a way to reduce their average water use .
If we could do that , the system could stay sustainable further into the future than we estimate currently , even if the climate changes . ” – David Pierce , climate researcher
The same researchers , Tim Barnett and David Pierce , published a study in 2008 which found that Lake Mead had a 50 % chance of going dry in the next 20 years if no effort was made to preserve a minimum amount of water in the reservoir and the climate continued to changed .
The authors ’ most recent study looks at the cuts required in water delivery while maintaining water levels in the reservoir to continue the supply to Las Vegas .
The researchers make a point of saying that Lake Powell and Lake Mead were built during and calibrated to the 20th century , one of the wettest in the last 1,200 years .
Analysis of tree ring records show that Colorado River flows in typical years are substantially lower , yet most long - term planning regarding the river uses those same 20th century water values .
If the river ’s flow is more in line with that shown by the tree rings , the Colorado River water shortfall could be even more severe .
“ All water - use planning is based on the idea that the next 100 years will be like the last 100 .
We considered the question : Can the river deliver water at the levels currently scheduled if the climate changes as we expect it to .
The answer is no . ” – Scripps research marine physicist Tim Barnett
The research paper , “ Sustainable water deliveries from the Colorado River in a changing climate , ” is published in the April 20 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Cutting inheritance tax would not be a high priority for an incoming Tory government , Ken Clarke has said .
The shadow business secretary told the BBC its main economic goals would be to cut public debt and restore growth .
The Tories ' pledge to take millions of families out of inheritance tax in September 2007 was seen as a key moment in reviving their political fortunes .
Later , a Conservative spokesman said the party was still committed to its manifesto pledge to cut the tax .
Labour had said the more Conservative economic policies came under scrutiny " the more they fall apart " .
' Tremendous mess '
Recent indications that the Tories will not reverse Labour 's planned tax rises for the rich have already caused internal ructions .
Increasing income tax for top-earners to 45 % from 2011 would be " difficult to avoid " , shadow chancellor George Osborne has said - a stance backed up by Mr Clarke and foreign secretary William Hague .
But the Conservative Mayor of London Boris Johnson has said the move would stifle British enterprise , a view Mr Clarke said was " just wrong " .
In recent weeks , senior Conservatives have stressed the party will face extremely tough choices if they win the next election given the state of the public finances .
The Conservatives insist cutting the overall burden of tax for families remains a long - term objective and have pledged to freeze council tax bills for two years among other proposals .
But they have declined to rule out tax rises after the next election .
We have been calling on the Tories for months to scrap this unfair giveaway
Angela Eagle , Treasury minister Mr Clarke told the BBC's Politics
Show the priority was to stabilise the public finances and to do so in a way which hopefully did not necessitate tax rises for the majority of people .
Tough choices would be required because of the " tremendous mess " the Tories would inherit if elected , he stressed , with debt levels " of a kind never previously seen " .
On inheritance tax , he said raising current thresholds was an " aspiration " which the party retained and hoped to get around to " sooner or later " .

At the 2007 party conference - at a time when a general election was considered imminent - Mr Osborne said the Tories would raise the threshold for inheritance tax from £ 300,000 to £ 1 m - potentially taking nine million families out of the tax .
But Mr Clarke stressed : " I do n't think we are going around any longer saying this is something we are going to do the moment we take power .
" We will have to consider when we can afford to do that .
I do n't think anyone is saying any different to that "
The BBC 's political correspondent Carole Walker said the inheritance tax pledge seemed like a firm commitment and any suggestion it was now being downplayed would be highly significant .
' Disadvantages ' Labour said David Cameron must say whether he agreed with Mr Clarke 's assessment .
" We have been calling on the Tories for months to scrap this unfair giveaway to the wealthiest few thousand estates , " said Treasury minister Angela Eagle .
" What is clear is that the more Conservative economic policies come under scrutiny the more they fall apart . "
Earlier , Mr Hague told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that reversing the 45 % tax rate move for people earning more than £ 150,000 a year would not be a priority .
Mr Johnson said the tax rise sends out the wrong signals to entrepreneurs Mr Hague acknowledged there were " disadvantages " in raising taxes and that many people believed a higher tax burden was a disincentive to enterprise .
But he said : " We are going to have to get a grip of this country 's debt .
We have a government that is planning to double the national debt in the next five years .
" Everyone out there in the streets know we can't carry on like that . "
" We are going to be honest with people .
There are going to be some tough and difficult choices . "
' Clobbering ' rich Later on Sunday , a Conservative Party spokesman said : " People should be clear that the promise we made on inheritance tax is a promise we will keep .
It will be in the manifesto .
" But for years George Osborne has said he will not write budgets - including the 2010 one - in advance .
" We are only able to help people who have saved to pass on something on to their children because we have identified those who will pay for it - non-domiciles . "
David Cameron said recently the rich would have to pay their " fair share " to rescue the economy .
This stance has angered , among others , former Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit and London Mayor Boris Johnson who warned that " clobbering the rich " would be bad for business .
Mr Johnson said it would send out the wrong signal and " deter enterprise " .
But Mr Clarke said his Tory colleague was " just wrong " on this and described the planned 45 % tax band as largely " symbolic " .
" It is not going to raise much money .
It is not going to turn off entrepreneurship , " he added .

Over 40 percent of Israel ’s Arab citizens say the Holocaust never happened , according to a survey published Monday .
But the University of Haifa sociologist who directed it , Sammy Smooha , said the results were most likely statements more of protest than of belief .
The survey found that 41 percent said the Holocaust never happened , up from 28 percent in 2006 .
Mr. Smooha says he thinks the increase signals a rising frustration among Arabs , who say they believe that recognizing the Holocaust gives justification to Israeli policies .
In just about every major contaminated food scare , Minnesotans become sick by the dozens while few people in Kentucky and other states are counted among the ill .
Contaminated peanuts ?
Forty - two Minnesotans were reported sick compared with three Kentuckians .
Jalapeño peppers last year ?
Thirty - one in Minnesota and two in Kentucky became ill .
The different numbers arise because health officials in Kentucky and many other states fail to investigate many complaints of food - related sickness while those in Minnesota do so diligently , safeguarding not only Minnesotans but much of the rest of the country , as well .
Congress and the Obama administration have said that more inspections and new food production rules are needed to prevent food - related diseases , but far less attention has been paid to fixing the fractured system by which officials detect and stop ongoing outbreaks .
Right now , uncovering which foods have been contaminated is left to a patchwork of more than 3,000 federal , state and local health departments that are , for the most part , poorly financed , poorly trained and disconnected , officials said .
The importance of a few epidemiologists in Minnesota demonstrates the problem .
If not for the Minnesota Department of Health , the Peanut Corporation of America might still be selling salmonella - laced peanuts , Dole might still be selling contaminated lettuce , and ConAgra might still be selling dangerous Banquet brand pot pies  sickening hundreds or thousands more people .
WASHINGTON 
Even the most exacting truth commission may have a hard time determining for certain whether brutal interrogations conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency helped keep the country safe .
Last week ’s release of long - secret Justice Department interrogation memorandums has given rise to starkly opposing narratives about what , if anything , was gained by the C.I.A.’s use of waterboarding , wall - slamming and other physical pressure to shock and intimidate Qaeda operatives .
Senior Bush administration officials , led by Vice President Dick Cheney and cheered by many Congressional Republicans , are fighting a rear - guard action in defense of their record .
Only by using the harshest methods , they insist , did the intelligence agency get the information it needed to round up Qaeda killers and save thousands of American lives .
Even President Obama ’s new director of national intelligence , Dennis C. Blair , wrote in a memorandum to his staff last week that “ high value information came from interrogations in which these methods were used , ” an assertion left out when the memorandum was edited for public release .
By contrast , Mr. Obama and most of his top aides have argued that the use of those methods betrayed American values  and anyway , produced unreliable information .
Those are a convenient pair of opinions , of course : the moral balancing would be far trickier if the C.I.A. methods were demonstrated to have been crucial in disrupting major plots .
This kid is probably the best human beatbox I ’ve ever heard , and yes , that ’s even better than James “ The AudioPoet ” Burchfield , that beatbox guy that performed at TED last year .

LOS ANGELES -- During a decade in the U.S. , Mexican immigrant Linex Rivera gave birth to three daughters , whose American citizenship offered her hope of staying in the land of opportunity .
But with job prospects drying up for her husband , Ms. Rivera last week joined a phalanx of compatriots at the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles inquiring about obtaining Mexican citizenship for their children .
" We are thinking of returning to Mexico and want our daughters to have all the rights of Mexican nationals , " says Ms. Rivera , whose ...
One day suspension for Memphis cop that caused deadly delay David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster

This A Tennessee police officer has been suspended without pay for a single day over delaying a motorist whose mother was dying in the back seat , according to published reports .
Deputy Micah McNinch pulled over Wayne Ables on March 12 after 2 a.m. as he raced his infirmed mother to a hospital just a mile from the site of the stop .
McNinch pulled Ables over for expired tags and , as evidenced in new video released to news agencies , kept the pair there while an ambulance and fire truck were en route .
After 11 minutes , the emergency vehicles arrived .
The driver had pleaded with the officer to escort them to the hospital a mere five minutes away .
" Ables says he told McNinch his mother was in the back seat , suffering from severe breathing problems , " reported My Eyewitness News .
" According to audio taken from the dash camera the deputy didnt want to give Ables his ticket until the ambulance arrived to the scene .
' I do n't want to give him this copy to sign until the ambulance gets here .
Otherwise he will leave and weve got an ambulance and a fire truck coming up her for no reason . ' "
" According to the Shelby County Sheriffs Office , deputies are instructed not to escort vehicles during traffic stops , but Sheriff Mark Luttrell says there are times when the policy needs to be worked around , " the publication noted in a separate report .
" Luttrell and Ables both say this shouldve been one of those times .
Ables says his mother died in the back seat , just 8/10 of a mile from the hospital .
' The last word I heard my mom say is I can't breathe son , I can't breathe , I need some air .
That 's what I 'm going to have to live with for the rest of my life .
When he sees his mom , give her a big hug , tell her he loves her , cause I cant do that with my mom anymore . ' "
" While paramedics were in route , Mr. Ables never alerted Deputy McNinch his mothers condition had worsened , " they reported .
" There were some judgemental errors made , and he needed to be held accountable for that , " said Shelby County Sheriff Mark Luttrell told Memphis CBS affiliate WREG .
" But for the most part , he says McNinch followed policy .
His file is clean , it includes two good performance reviews .
So rather than severely punish him , he was suspended for one day without pay .
" ' I forgive him , because it's what my mom would want , because my mom would , she 'd do it for me , ' said Ables .
" 'As long as there 's lessons learned here and they can put it in policy , ' he added . "
Oddly enough , the Shelby County Sheriffs Department is the same which once appointed Elvis Presley to Deputy Sheriff [ PDF link ] in a PR stunt .
" Elvis had an infatuation with law enforcement , and he worked his way up to the ranks at the Shelby County Sheriff 's Office in his hometown of Memphis , " noted Heritage Auction Galleries .
" He first received an honorary sheriff 's badge from Sheriff Bill Morris in 1970 , and ultimately acquired several authentic badges ( as well as actual law enforcement authority ) from subsequent sheriffs in Shelby County . "

As the eldest son and heir of 17th baronet , Sir Peter Osborne , George Osborne has clearly had a very privileged upbringing .
Clearly out of touch with reality , he tried to deflect attention away from his friends in the City , the bankers and greedy speculators who have dragged this country into the financial crisis , by pounding public sector workers .
It was interesting to see the subsequent back - tracking as this outburst backfired on the Tory Party .
However , it gives us a clear insight into Tory thinking and what would be in store should they succeed at the next general election .
His remark that “ the age of excess is over ” will outrage nurses , paramedics , occupational therapists , midwives , hospital cleaners and cooks – all my members working in the NHS , who have certainly never had an age of excess to get over .
They do not need to be told by the Tories that “ we need an age of restraint and responsibility ’ it goes with their jobs .
Just because they signed up to a three year pay deal , in good faith , it does not make them part of the “ debt problem ” .
In fact many low paid health workers face long - term debt problems of their own .
Last year NHS staff accepted a three - year pay deal , which is worth 2.54 per cent from 1 April this year .
Hardly excessive , it wo n’t cover the extra cost of everyday essentials such as food , fuel , transport gas and electricity .
A nurse on £ 22,000 a year or a hospital porter on £ 14,000 might be forgiven for wondering how this “ age of excess ” passed them by .
The deal covers more than one million health workers and was agreed through the NHS pay review body .
Only recently MPs were awarded 2.33 per cent by their review body , which makes the two awards very similar .
This suggests that the deal is not out of kilter with prevailing economic conditions .
The Tories cannot lay the blame for the economic crisis at the door of public sector workers , with or without three - year pay deals .
Local Government workers in England , Wales and Northern Ireland have just been offered 0.5 per cent - just 3 p an hour for hundreds of thousands of workers .
Instead of piling pressure on public sector workers , the Tories would do well to remember the vital role that local services play during an economic downturn .
In times of recession governments have traditionally turned to public services as their first line of defence .
Our government is right to look at preserving jobs and boosting the economy by bringing forward a planned programme of public works – building roads , schools and hospitals .
George Osborne ’s plans to make cuts in public spending take the “ bulk of the strain ” in order to balance the fiscal books is unfair and unworkable .
Public services are essential to the health and wellbeing of people and the quality and stability of local communities .
We are already seeing cuts across the public sector as a result of the recession but Tory plans go much further and would have a devastating impact .
They would widen the gap between the rich and poor and create more long - term social instability for all .
Public sector workers were never invited to party on excess - it ’s time the Tories told their friends in the City - their party is over .
Dave Prentis is General Secretary of UNISON , the UK ’s largest public sector union with 1.3 m members
Traffic pollution was identified as a significant problem Exposure to traffic pollution could affect the development of babies in the womb , US researchers have warned .
They found the higher a mother 's level of exposure in early and late pregnancy , the more likely it was that the baby would not grow properly .
The study , published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health , looked at 336,000 babies born in New Jersey between 1999 and 2003 UK experts said much more detailed research into a link was needed .
Exposure
The researchers , from the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey , used information from birth certificates and hospital discharge records .
They recorded details including each mother 's ethnicity , marital status , education , whether or not she was a smoker - as well as where she lived when her baby was born .
Daily readings of air pollution from monitoring points around the state of New Jersey were taken from the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Residence near a roadway during pregnancy , may affect foetal growth
Professor David Rich , University of Medicine and Dentistry , New Jersey
The scientists then took data from the monitoring point which was within six miles ( 10 km ) of the mothers ' homes to work out what their exposure to air pollution had been during each of the three trimesters of pregnancy .
It was found that mothers of small , and very small , birth weight babies were more likely to be younger , less well educated , of African - American ethnicity , smokers , poorer , and single parents than mothers with normal birth weight babies .
But , even after these factors had been taken into account , higher levels of air pollutants were linked to restricted foetal growth .
Two kinds of pollution produced by cars - tiny sooty particles and nitrogen dioxide - were found to have an impact .
Particulate matter is produced from vehicle exhausts and can lodge in the lungs .
Fine particles , such as PM 2.5s , which penetrate deep into the lungs , have been linked to deaths from heart and respiratory diseases .
Nutrients
The risk of a small birth weight baby rose significantly with each increase in particulate matter of four micrograms per metres squared , during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy .
Similarly , the risk of a very small birth weight baby rose significantly with each 10 parts per billion increase in nitrogen dioxide .
Writing in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health , the team led by Professor David Rich , said : " Our findings suggest that air pollution , perhaps specifically traffic emissions during early and late pregnancy and / or factors associated with residence near a roadway during pregnancy , may affect foetal growth . "
They say it is not clear exactly how air pollution might restrict foetal growth .
But they add previous research suggests that air pollution might alter cell activity , or cut the amount of oxygen and nutrients a baby receives while in the womb .
Professor Patrick O'Brien , of the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , said : " This is an interesting study because it flags up a possibility of a link .
" But I think it needs to be looked at again in more detail because of the probability of confounding factors .
" The researchers ruled out smoking and social - economic background - other factors which are linked to small babies - but there are many other factors , such as diet , which could have an effect . "
Professor O'Brien added that future research into the effects of pollution should be careful to check if babies are born small because their parents are small , and to ensure pregnancies are dated from scans , where this study did neither .

NYC Teens Chide Palin's Abstinence Call New York City teens consider abstinence but think young Palin is a " hypocrite . "
May 7 , 2009  -- New York City students who heard Bristol Palin 's warnings against teen pregnancy say they might consider abstinence , but they would n't take advice on it from the young unwed mother .
Palin , the 18 - year - old daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , recently was selected as an ambassador to The Candie 's Foundation to help create awareness about the pitfalls of teen pregnancy .
On Wednesday , she carried her message to about 150 teens at a town meeting forum at The Times Center that included " Heroes " actress Hayden Panettiere and Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza , who was a teen father .
" It 's a big flop , " said Jerry Kowal , a senior at Solomon Schecter High School in Hartsdale , N.Y. , referring to Palin 's campaign to get teens to abstain from sex .
" I do n't think it 's her real opinion , " the 17 - year - old told ABCNews.com .
" She 's just trying to help her mother .
She said it herself that abstinence education does n't work .
I looked it up . "
In a February interview with Fox News ' Greta Susteren , Palin talked about how much her life had changed since the birth of then - two month old Trig and how teenage abstinence was " unrealistic . "
Palin Says Remarks ' Out of Context '
Palin , who gave birth last December , has said earlier remarks were " taken out of context . "
Her pregnancy came on the heels of her mother Sarah Palin 's bid for the Republican vice - presidential spot .
Now , the teen mother 's own son is only months away in age from her youngest brother Trig , whom she cradled in front of television audiences on the campaign trail .
After the spotlight of the presidential campaign , Tripp 's father , Levi Johnson , broke off his engagement to Palin .
In an interview Wednesday with ABC News ' " Good Morning America , " Palin said , " I 'm relatable .
And I 'm a teen myself .
Regardless of what I did personally , I just think that abstinence is the only way that you can effectively , 100 percent , foolproof way to prevent pregnancy . "
But some in her teenage audience disagreed .
" I do n't get it , " said Raina Brot , 15 , from the Beacon School in Manhattan .
" She 's being kind of a hypocrite . "
The Candie 's Foundation 's mission to educate teenagers about the consequences of teen pregnancy was evident in the posters that draped the stage .
They read , " You think your parents gave you a lot of crap ? " or , " You think being in school stinks ? "
One with a photo of a baby crib read , " Not really what you pictured your first crib , huh ? "
Teen Births on Rise
A report published in January by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) indicates that teen birth rates are rising in 26 states , ending a 15 - year decline .
The highest increases are in four states , including Palin 's home , Alaska , as well as Mississippi , Montana , Hawaii and Nevada .
Regionally , the Northeast has the lowest and the Southwest has the highest rates .
According The Candie 's Foundation , the United States has the highest rate of teen pregnancies in the industrialized world .
Each year , some 750,000 American teens get pregnant , and , like Palin , 8 out of 10 do not marry the father .
Palin told students that although she was " blessed " by having a large family to help her , the baby thwarted her plans to go to college outside of Alaska and put her " life on the fast track . "
" You have so much responsibility and hard work , " she told the teens .
" It 's a 24 - hour - a - day job .
You do n't have friends and you can't just go out to the movies or go get your hair done .
It 's baby first . "
Experts blame the increase of teen births on a number of factors , including a rise in highly publicized teen pregnancies ( including Palin's ) , abstinence - only programs and a disproportionate number of pregnancies among minority teenagers .
According to Brenna Owens , a social worker at CIS , a middle school in the South Bronx , whose students attended the Candie 's forum , teens can be receptive to abstinence messages .
" But it depends on what a child is ready to hear in the moment , " she told ABCNews.com .
" They are already exposed to sex in music and on television , " said her colleague , literacy teacher Sonia Hameed .
" It 's pumped at them all the time .
It looks glamorous , but they do n't see the impact . "
The Candie 's Foundation is hoping Palin 's voice will be just one of many that helps reverse the growing teen birth rate .
They advocate both abstince and information on contraception .
" We know having a baby as a teen is really tough on the teen mother and very challenging for the children , " said panelist Sarah Brown , CEO of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy .
" And the economy is so tough that most teens can't finish high school .
The teen years should be used for fun . "
A survey by Seventeen magazine showed that most teens cited three " emotional reasons " for having sex .
" When teens have sex , they say it just happens , " said editor and panelist Ann Shoket .
" They feel swept away , they are not using birth control properly and they are afraid to insist on condoms . "
Palin : ' Think First '
One bright spot in the study revealed that 70 percent of teens surveyed said they might hesitate on having sex " if they had plans for the future . "
" Feeding your dreams gives you something to plan , " Shoket said .
Palin agreed .
" I was n't thinking about the future , " she said .
" Think before you act . "
" I do n't believe in abstinence , but I think Bristol Palin could have some influence , " said Delwara Begum , a 16 - year - old from Beacon High School in Manhattan .
" I do n't believe it 's realistic , but she is speaking out and giving some kind of caution . "
Still , her classmate disagreed .
" When you say , ' Do n't have sex , ' teens will rebel , " Ajanay Squire , 16 , told ABCNews.com .
Many studies have shown that abstinence - only programs , like those funded by the federal government , are ineffective , according to David Landry , senior research associate at the Guttmacher Institute , which advances sexual and reproductive health worldwide .
" Good comprehensive sex education does an excellent job in promoting abstinence , " he told ABCNews.com .
" It is the most effective way of avoiding pregnancy .
" But the problem with abstinence alone , it 's terribly ineffective and young people like Bristol Palin do not adhere to it .
And when they do n't have the proper information and when they are sexually active , they often have unprotected sex . "
Palin Propelled by ' Circumstances '
" I just feel for [ Bristol Palin ] , " said Landry .
" She seems to be caught in the middle of a political firestorm , and I 'm not sure how much of it is by her own free well .
Circumstances propelled her . "
Some teens wondered if a high - profile teen like Palin could understand their own situation .
" It 's about peer pressure , " said Joy Ocean , 16 , from Brooklyn 's John Dewey High School .
" It 's a little overwhelming , and she has n't been in our shoes . "
" I saw [ Bristol Palin ] on TV and how hard it was on her with her mother in the spotlight , " said Mignonette Brathwaite , Ocean 's 15 - year - old classmate .
" She knows her mother is worried about her political campaign .
She would n't want her to mess up her image . "
Their classmate , Rose Acevado , 16 , knows the pain of a teen pregnancy .
Her sister suffered a miscarriage after hiding a pregnancy for nine months .
Today , her sister is pregnant again .
" This is a good thing , " she said of the message of abstinence , but not from Bristol Palin .
" We 'd take it from someone true and honest , not a celebrity . "
The pay gap between government workers and lower - compensated private employees is growing as public employees enjoy sizable benefit growth even in a distressed economy , federal figures show .
Public employees earned benefits worth an average of $ 13.38 an hour in December 2008 , the latest available data , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) says .
Private - sector workers got $ 7.98 an hour .
Overall , total compensation for state and local workers was $ 39.25 an hour — $ 11.90 more than in private business .
In 2007 , the gap in wages and benefits was $ 11.31 .
The gap has been expanding because of the increasing value of public employee benefits .
Last year , government benefits rose three times more than those in the private sector : up 69 cents an hour for civil servants , 23 cents for private workers .
Labor costs account for about half of state and local spending , according to BLS and Census data .
Benefits consume a growing share of that , now 34 % .
Illinois state Sen. Chris Lauzen , a Republican , says government benefits are unsustainable and unfair to taxpayers who earn less than civil servants .
" People will become angrier and angrier when they learn the difference between their pay and benefits and what we give to public employees , " he says .
Jennifer Porcari of the American Federation of Teachers , a union representing 1.4 million educators and state employees , says BLS figures that show government employees earn higher wages are misleading because jobs are n't comparable .
Government jobs , such as teaching , often require more education .
Some states are asking unions for help with budget problems .
New Mexico employees will pay an extra 1.5 % of salary toward pensions for two years , cutting the state 's share .
Ohio 's unions will take unpaid furlough days to save the state $ 440 million over two years .
In the third year , workers will get most of the money back .
The wage gap between government and private workers has stayed roughly the same since 2002 .
Benefits are a different story .
For every $ 1 - an - hour pay increase , public employees have gotten $ 1.17 in new benefits .
Private workers have gotten just 58 cents in benefits for every $ 1 raise .
The difference : Companies have ended most traditional pension plans and increased workers ' share of health care costs .
Government paid an average of $ 8,800 annually toward employee medical insurance .
Private companies paid $ 4,100 .
A full - time government worker receives benefits worth an average of $ 27,830 per year .
A private worker 's benefits are worth $ 16,598 .

Social media is great .
Social media brings people together .
Social media opens the conversation .
Social media puts you in the eyes of the world .
Social media gives you a voice .
All true .
All valid .
All beneficial .
But what happens when the eyes that social media puts you in front of are n’t the friendly kind ?
What happens when being transparent in social media opens you up to harassment , abuse and virtual stalking ?
Sadly it ’s a very real problem .
Even sadder , some of the social networks seem very slow to react to this problem .
Does this mean they ’re not taking it seriously , and if so , will virtual stalking be the straw that potentially breaks the social media camel ’s back ?
Online Friend ?
Case Study
People are friendly by nature .
We want to connect and meet others – it ’s in our genetic make - up .
The last few years have made this easier than ever .
Sites like Facebook , Twitter , Ning , MySpace , Friendfeed and more open up the world to us .
Our blogs are our own private community in a public setting .
Online forums and chat rooms mean there ’s no such thing as physical walls or barriers .
Which makes targeting someone easier .
Karen * is a blogger who owns her own business and also runs a Moms community online .
It allows other bloggers to take part in community discussions , write , sell and buy products and generally acts just as an offline community would .
Last year , she invited a new girl to join the community .
For Karen , this is what happened next :
Her business was reported as unethical and fraudulent on Ripoff Report
as unethical and fraudulent on Ripoff Report
The girl set up fake social network accounts to spread lies about Karen ’s business
to spread lies about Karen ’s business Karen is followed on every network and forum by the girl , who publishes false information on Karen and her business
These are just some of the ways Karen has been targeted .
Why does n’t she have the lies taken down from Ripoff Report or contact the police ?
Unfortunately , the owner of Ripoff Report Ed Magedson seems more interested in traffic to his site than actual facts being reported .
I ’ve written about why Ripoff Report is just as big a ripoff before , and the fact that the site wo n’t take down old reports says it all about their integrity .
As far as Karen reporting her stalker to the police , she ’s more afraid for her little girl ’s safety as well as the continued anguish cross - state law cases would cause .
The cost is prohibitive as well .
Karen is n’t the only example .
On Twitter , I ’ve seen first - hand examples of guys throwing sexual abuse at female users , with graphic descriptions of what they ’d like to do to the user .
I ’ve seen other users bombard accounts with profanity , racial slurs and more .
I know that these cases have been reported to Twitter ’s support team and nothing ’s been done about the abuser , who instead continues to add new people to their account to abuse further .
This says a ?
lot about the customer service support that sites like Twitter has .
Or does n’t , as is abundantly clear .
We ’ve also read the stories about suicides from MySpace bullying and Facebook groups spreading malicious and hurtful lies .
So what ’s the answer ?
Some people have suggested that the very transparency that is advocated on social media is part of the problem .
By offering too much information , we ’re feeding the abusers and the harassers and the stalkers .
Is this true ?
Can our openness be used as an excuse for virtual abuse ?
Personally I do n’t buy into that argument .
I can see why it ’s suggested but no excuse can make up for the type of mental anguish people are put through for being honest .
I do n’t have the solution .
But there are questions that can be asked to work toward a solution .
Do we make it more difficult than just signing up with a false email account ?
Should social networks be more pro-active at responding to reports of abuse ?
Can we as a community highlight and name and shame abusers ?
Websites like Jodi’s Voice help raise awareness but they ’re currently the few among the many abusers .
Like I said , I do n’t have the solution .
It ’s clear that one is needed though , before the likes of Karen and others like her become another real - life statistic from a virtual hate campaign .
Ideas ?
* Karen is a pseudonym to protect the real identity of the person behind her .
Her stalker has admitted to Karen that it ’s jealousy behind her hate campaign .
It ’s still continuing today .
Bush Administration authorized use of insects in interrogations John Byrne
Published : Thursday April 16 , 2009
Print This Email This The Bush Administration Office of Legal Counsel authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to put insects inside a confinement box as part of the Administration 's " harsh interrogation " practice , as well as throwing detainees into walls , according to memos released by President Barack Obama on Thursday .
Read the full memos here .
" You would like to place Zubadayah in a cramped confinement box with an insect .
You have informed us he has a fear of insects , " the Bush White House said .
" As we understand it , no actually harmful insect will be placed in the box .
Thus , though the introduction of an insect may produce trepidation in Zubaydah ( which we discuss below ) , it certainly does not cause physical pain . "
But , the memo cautioned , to comply with the law , the CIA " must inform him that the insects will not have a sting that would produce death or severe pain . "
Part of the text beneath a description of the insect torture was redacted .
Time 's Michael Scherer notes , " The insect interrogation technique , as it turned out , was never used by the CIA , according to a second declassified memo released Thursday .
' We understand that  for reasons unrelated to any concerns that it might violate the [ criminal ] statute  the CIA never used the technique and has removed it from the list of authorized interrogation techniques , ' wrote Steven Bradbury , a principal deputy assistant attorney general , in the footnote to a on May 10 , 2005 document . "
Detailed description of ' walling ' detainees
It also provides a detailed description of " walling , " a practice in which detainees were thrown against walls as part of the interrogation process ( one detainee said his neck was tied with a towel and thrown against a plywood wall in a recently leaked Red Cross report ) .
" For walling , a flexible false wall will be constructed .
The individual is placed with his heels touching the wall .
The interrogator pulls the individual forward and then quickly and firmly pushes the individual into the wall .
It is the individual 's shoulder blades that hit the wall .
" During this motion , the head and neck are supported with a rolled hood or towel that provides a c-collar effect to help prevent whiplash .
To further reduce the probability of injury , the individual is allowed to rebound from the flexible wall .
You have orally informed us that the false wall is in part constructed to create a loud sound when the individual hits it , which will further shock or surprise in the individual .
In part , the idea is to create a sound that will make the impact seem far worse than it is and that will be far worse than any injury that might result from the action . "
The White House lawyers characterized this practice as " rough handling . "
" While walling involves what might be characterized as rough handling , it does not involve the threat of imminent death or , as discussed above , the infliction of severe physical pain .
Moreover , once again we understand that use of this technique will not be accompanied by any specific verbal threat that violence will ensue absent cooperation .
Thus , like the facial slap , walling can only constitute a threat of severe physical pain if a reasonable person would infer such a threat from the use of the technique itself .
Walling does not in and of itself inflict severe pain or suffering . "
As part of the release of the memos Thursday , the Justice Department said they would provide attorneys to any CIA interrogator who engaged in the practice thinking it was lawful under the aegis of the memo .
According to Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff , writing earlier this year , former Bush officials may find themselves in hot water over one of the memos released Thursday .
" An internal Justice Department report on the conduct of senior lawyers who approved waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics is causing anxiety among former Bush administration officials , " Isikoff wrote .
" H. Marshall Jarrett , chief of the department 's ethics watchdog unit , the Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) , confirmed last year he was investigating whether the legal advice in crucial interrogation memos ' was consistent with the professional standards that apply to Department of Justice attorneys . '
According to two knowledgeable sources who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters , a draft of the report was submitted in the final weeks of the Bush administration .
It sharply criticized the legal work of two former top officials Jay Bybee and John Yooas well as that of Steven Bradbury , who was chief of the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) at the time the report was submitted , the sources said .
( Bybee , Yoo and Bradbury did not respond to multiple requests for comment . ) "
" The matter is under review , " Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller is quoted as saying .

HOT sleeping beauty , would love to wake up to that every morning .
For a while , one of the principal criticisms from President Obama ’s detractors was that he ’s trying to take on too many policy challenges at once .
…
The argument has , apparently , evolved into a new - but - related criticism :
The chief spokesperson for GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell just said in an interview that leading Republicans are going to ratchet up their criticism of the Obama administration for releasing too many big plans on the economy — with too little sense of how they mesh with or impact each other .
The comments from McConnell spokesperson Don Stewart amount to a preview of what we ’ll likely be hearing from Senate Republicans and other Republican leaders in the days ahead .
“ We ca n’t help but notice the numerous and sundry plans that seem to come out at a rate of one a week without any clear picture of how they interact and whether they interact well or not , ” Stewart told me .
“ That ’s a very real concern among Senate Republicans . ”
President Obama made the point that Republicans have no ideas to help try and fix the country which they so willingly broke , but Britney Cantor from the just - say - no / Rush Limbaugh party does have a new , very super - duper - super - secret Gingrich - like plan that he feels will turn back the tide of resentment the country has for Republicans .
Looking at the new polling , the GOP does have very big problems with the American people .
Anyway , his plan is to try and sandbag the most inexperienced members of the Democratic Party and then put it on YouTube .
Foxx is part of a team of Republican members that House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) has put together to create embarrassing , YouTube - worthy moments for vulnerable Democratic freshmen .
Cantor ’s floor staff has created a photo album to help identify the 42 most vulnerable Democrats .
The aides send daily e-mails to the members of the attack team and alert lawmakers when these targeted members are speaking on the floor .
They even draft quick scripts to help focus the questioning .
Democrats are now hip to the scam and rarely take the bait .
A top aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) quickly ushers most junior members out of the chamber whenever Republicans launch an attack — even if the member is controlling debate .
But the guerrilla tactics — which are just about all the Republicans have — are sure to continue as long as Democratic leaders , in a time - honored bid to help junior members look productive , keep encouraging them to offer amendments and bills .
He 's going with the Macaca Effect .
Keith Olbermann does a good job exposing the Cantor Scripts .
I mean , these fools need someone to write their lines for them .
My God , check out the side - by - side Republican fools named Paul Brown and Jason Chaffetz as they recite their lines perfectly , but they forgot to memorize their lines .
Or maybe they do n't have the brain power to do that much .
It will take time for these newbies to learn how to debate on the floor , but how pathetic do the Republicans look when all they can do is use their membership to imitate Jesse Watters ?
Down With Tyranny has much more .
A recent surge in arrests and cocaine seizures in Peru points to an increased presence of Mexican drug cartels , counter - narcotics officials say .
The cartels have also contributed to more drug - related violence in Peruvian cities , ports and in remote valleys in this Andean country where coca , cocaine ’s base material , is grown , the officials say .
Peruvian claims of Mexican cartels expanding echo those by officials in other Latin American countries , from Honduras to Argentina , where Mexican gangs have supplanted once - powerful Colombian cartels as kings of the illicit - drug underworld .
In an interview last week , Peru ’s top anti-narcotics official , Gen. Miguel Hidalgo , said 32 suspected Mexican cartel members had been arrested in Peru in the last two years , compared with “ almost no one ” during the previous comparable period .

Four of the arrests occurred in September , when police seized 2.5 tons of cocaine hidden in rubber ship bumpers that were about to be sent to Mexico from Lima ’s port district .
Mexican cartels have also established themselves in other Peruvian ports to facilitate the shipment of cocaine , said top anti-drug prosecutor Sonia Medina .
The northern port city of Paita , near Piura , is considered by authorities to be especially corrupt .
Several Mexicans were arrested and tried along with 20 others in connection with the 2006 assassination of Judge Hernan Saturno , who was bringing a case against members of the Juarez cartel .
Saturno ’s killing is one of 16 cases since 2006 in which Mexican sicarios , or assassins , are thought to have been involved .
Medina said paid Mexican killers are operating in Peru as enforcers for their bosses back home .
That Mexican drug lords are sending emissaries here is no surprise to Hidalgo in light of Peruvian and U.S. estimates that 80 % of all Peruvian cocaine -- which accounts for roughly one - third of world production -- is shipped to Mexico .
Advertisement
The final destination could include European as well as U.S. drug users , he said .
Authorities say cocaine production in 2007 , the last year for which figures are available , was estimated at 290 tons , double the United Nations estimate for 1999 .
About 135,000 acres were devoted to coca growing in Peru last year , said drug expert Jaime Antezana , up 40 % from 1999 .
Hidalgo said Peruvian armed forces seized 30.6 tons of cocaine in 2008 .
Most of Peru ’s coca is grown and processed in the remote Huallaga and Apurimac - Ene valleys .
Those areas have seen a resurgence in recent years of the left - wing rebel group Shining Path , which was largely vanquished by the Peruvian government ’s anti-terrorism campaign of the 1990s .
Advertisement
Now , Antezana says , the Shining Path has resurfaced in two factions -- each small , but growing , cocaine - trafficking groups .
He called the factions mini-FARCs , a reference to Colombia ’s largest rebel army , which also finances its armed campaign with drug profits .
The rebels remain minor players , with no more than 1,000 fighters , intelligence officials say .
But Antezana and others fear that drug profits could fuel their growth .
To make matters worse , said Medina , a Korean Chinese gang known as Red Dragon has also landed in Peru , allegedly trafficking in drugs as well as humans trying to reach the United States .

“ Sadly , ” Medina said , “ I must recognize that narco - trafficking is on the rise in Peru . ”

Ty Lawson to enter NBA Draft ; Ellington too
It ’s official : Ty Lawson and Wayne Ellington are forgoing their remaining college eligibility and declaring for the 2009 NBA Draft .
Lawson was arguably the best point guard in the country this season and was named ACC Player of the Year .
He gutted through a swollen toe in the NCAA tournament , guiding the Tar Heels to a national championship ( and f — — g my bracket in the process ) .
NBADraft.net has Lawson going # 15 ( to Detroit , which seems odd considering Joe Dumars has hitched his wagon to Rodney Stuckey ) , while DraftExpress has him slated for the 11th pick ( New Jersey — another odd pairing , considering Devin Harris ’ stellar play this season ) .
Both mocks have Lawson behind Ricky Rubio and Brandon Jennings amongst point guards .
Jonny Flynn , Tyreke Evans , Eric Maynor and Stephen Curry are ranked ahead of Lawson in one mock or the other .
I have n’t seen much of Jennings , but I think I ’d favor Lawson over the other five right now .
He has everything you want in a point guard — good vision , quickness , speed , strength , shooting — except for size , and Chris Paul ( and others ) have proved that you do n’t need to be tall to succeed in today ’s NBA .
As for Ellington , I ’m surprised to see that NBADraft . net has him going 11th to New Jersey .
Draft Express projects him to go with the 30th pick to the Cavs .
When I first heard the news that he was going pro , my assumption was that he’d be a second round pick that might sneak into the first round with a series of good workouts .
He shot the ball brilliantly in the NCAA tournament and that kind of clutch performance can really boost a player ’s stock , but I ’d be shocked if he becomes a lottery pick .
Wings that can score are a dime a dozen in the NBA , so unless a player has a quality that really makes him stand out — i.e. Gerald Henderson ’s athletic ability — they usually end up being late - first round or second round picks .
We ’ll see .

ICRC Report on the Treatment of Fourteen " High Value Detainees " in CIA Custody by the International Committee of the Red Cross 43 pp. , February 2007
When we get people who are more concerned about reading the rights to an Al Qaeda terrorist than they are with protecting the United States against people who are absolutely committed to do anything they can to kill Americans , then I worry … .
These are evil people .
And we ’re not going to win this fight by turning the other cheek .
If it had n’t been for what we did — with respect to the …enhanced interrogation techniques for high - value detainees … — then we would have been attacked again .
Those policies we put in place , in my opinion , were absolutely crucial to getting us through the last seven - plus years without a major - casualty attack on the US … .
— Former Vice President Dick Cheney , February 4 , 20091
1 .
When it comes to torture , it is not what we did but what we are doing .
It is not what happened but what is happening and what will happen .
In our politics , torture is not about whether or not our polity can “ let the past be past ” — whether or not we can “ get beyond it and look forward . ”
Torture , for Dick Cheney and for President Bush and a significant portion of the American people , is more than a repugnant series of “ procedures ” applied to a few hundred prisoners in American custody during the last half - dozen or so years — procedures that are described with chilling and patient particularity in this authoritative report by the International Committee of the Red Cross .
2
Torture is more than the specific techniques — the forced nudity , sleep deprivation , long - term standing , and suffocation by water , ” among others — that were applied to those fourteen “ high - value detainees ” and likely many more at the “ black site ” prisons secretly maintained by the CIA on three continents .
Torture , as the former vice - president ’s words suggest , is a critical issue in the present of our politics — and not only because of ongoing investigations by Senate committees , or because of calls for an independent inquiry by congressional leaders , or for a “ truth commission ” by a leading Senate Democrat , or because of demands for a criminal investigation by the ACLU and other human rights organizations , and now undertaken in Spain , the United Kingdom , and Poland . 3
For many in the United States , torture still stands as a marker of political commitment — of a willingness to “ do anything to protect the American people , ” a manly readiness to know when to abstain from “ coddling terrorists ” and do what needs to be done .
Torture ’s powerful symbolic role , like many ugly , shameful facts , is left unacknowledged and undiscussed .
But that does n’t make it any less real .
On the contrary .
Torture is at the heart of the deadly politics of national security .
The former vice - president , as able and ruthless a…
The reigning champ of most Earth - sized planets yet is a world called Gliese 581 e , which circles a star that has four planets total .
It is called the smallest because of its mass , which is just 1.9 times the mass of Earth , making it the lightest known alien planet to date .
The other planets range in mass from 5 to 16 times the mass of Earth .
Thediscovery of the lightest exoplanet ever found , less than twice the mass of the Earth , has electrified a week - long meeting on astronomy and space science inEurope .
Thestunning finding was made by a team headed by Michel Mayor of the GenevaObservatory .
The icing on the cake is a related discovery that a previously discovered ?
super - Earth ?
orbiting the same star appears to reside in thehabitable zone .
The findingportends the discovery of a true Earth - mass planet , which could come in abouttwo years , Mayor said .
Mayor madethe very first discovery of an exoplanet , a Jupiter - sized world that orbits thestar 51 Pegasi , in 1994 .
Among his many planet discoveries since then atESO ?s La Silla Observatory in Chile , Mayor has made a specialty of observing the star Gliese 581 .
Located 20.5 light - years away in theconstellation Libra (? the Scales ? ) , Gliese 581 is a red dwarf star with onlyone - third of the mass of our sun .
Two yearsago , Mayor discovered a planet the size of Neptune and two super - Earthsorbiting this star .
The newly discovered planet , named Gliese 581 e , isnow the fourth known planet in this solar system and the lightest , weighing inat only 1.94 Earth masses .
It fliesround the star at dizzying speed , taking just 3.15 days to complete anorbit .
?
The surprise for me was to discover a planet with by far the lowestmass seen to date , ? says Mayor .
This newplanet orbits so close to the star that its water would have boiled away longago .
It is therefore not inthe habitable zone ?
the region of a solar system where water can stayliquid on the surface of a rocky planet , and , consequently , where scientistsexpect life can occur .
In our solar system , the habitable zone is roughlybetween the orbits of Venus and Mars ( with Earth sitting not quite in themiddle ) .
In finding thenew planet , Mayor has been able to more accurately determine the orbit for theoutermost planet , Gliese 581 d. One of the super - Earths in the solarsystem , this planet is closer to the host star than was thought when it wasdiscovered in 2007 .
And that provided the second great surprise .
?
It isthe only ( Earth - like ) exoplanet found inside the habitable water zone of theparent star , ? says Mayor .
Gliese 581d is 7 Earth - masses , and team member Stephane Udry says the planet is probably toomassive to be made only of rocky material .
?
We can speculate that it isan icy planet that has migrated closer to the star , ?
he says .
At the Europeanmeeting , Mayor added the latest news indicated , ?
No icebergs , but there may bean ocean at the surface , meaning this is a new class of ocean planet .?
To detectexoplanets , Mayor ?s team studies a star ?s radial velocity , in which the tinytugs exerted by orbiting exoplanets produce a complex wobble in the star .
Thiswobble can be analyzed to learn about properties of the planets in the solarsystem .
The velocity of a star with multiple planets has to be followedfor several years to discover the different properties of its orbiting planets , and this requires instrumentation that is extremely stable from year to year -- one of the big challenges in detecting exoplanets through the radial velocitytechnique .
The team ? sobserving program began back in 2004 with a sample of 400 sun - like stars .
Mayor isnow scooping up small exoplanets that have been missed by a rival searchtechnique ( called transit photometry ) which involves measuring the tiny fall ina star ?s magnitude when an exoplanet passes between the star and the Earth .
Both techniques , transit photometry and radial velocity , are strongly biased tocatch giant planets with the mass of Jupiter or more , as well as smallerplanets that orbit very close to their star .
But to find small planets orbitingwithin a star ?s habitable zone , Mayor ? s approach now seems to have the edge .
The teamhas found that one - third ( 30 % ) of exoplanet systems discovered to date includesmall bodies .
?
We have discovered a new category of small exoplanets , ?
saysMayor . ?
Within a couple of years we will drive down our lower limit ofdetection to the mass of the Earth .
The next challenge after that is to detect a twin of the Earth in the habitable zone of a solar - type star .?
The nextstage for Mayor ?s team is to migrate the detection technology from the current3.6 - meter telescope to ESO?s 8 - meter Very Large Telescope in order to improvethe precision of observations .
After that , Mayor looks forward to using the European Extremely Large Telescope ( E - ELT ) , a 42 - meter eye - on - the - sky that isplanned to be operating by 2018 .
Currentlyin the later stages of design , this facility will be capable of directlyimaging larger exoplanets , and possibly will be able to search theiratmospheres for biosignatures .
E-ELT will answer fundamental questions on theformation and evolution of exoplanets , bringing us one step closer to answering the question : are we alone ?
Her aim is for Washington to become , in just six years , one of the best - performing urban school districts in the country , while drastically reducing the black - white achievement gap .
“ A byproduct of that , ” she added , “ will be that we will take away from all the other school districts and schools across the country the excuse that because the kids are poor , minority , whatever it might be , that they ca n’t achieve at the same high levels . ”

Ms. Rhee ’s weakness is her bedside manner .
Her transition from rebel to chancellor has been a little rough , and she is often perceived as trying to mount a cultural revolution in a way that antagonizes teachers and itself can undermine education .
Surveys show that when teachers leave their jobs , it ’s not just because of low pay but also because of unhappiness with their bosses or work environment .
Perhaps recognizing the problem , Ms. Rhee lately has reached out to teachers to try to explain her ideas .
The reform camp is driven partly by research suggesting that great teachers are far more important to student learning than class size , school resources or anything else .
One study suggests that if black kids could get teachers from the profession ’s most effective quartile for four years in a row , the achievement gap would disappear .
As a result , Ms. Rhee has proposed that teachers surrender some job protections in exchange for the chance to earn more money  up to $ 131,000 annually , more than double the average salary for an American public school teacher .
But teachers worry , not unreasonably , that their performance is difficult to measure , that they will be judged by incompetent principals , and that promised bonuses may later dry up .
For now the two sides seem stalemated .
“ If we come to an impasse , we ’re going to move forward with our reforms anyway , ” Ms. Rhee said .
“ Then it potentially gets uglier . ”
She ’s right on both counts  it could get very ugly , and Washington ’s children should n’t suffer indefinitely in broken schools just because of a collective - bargaining stalemate .
It would help if President Obama firmly backed Ms. Rhee .
Education reform could be the most potent antipoverty program in the country , and Ms. Rhee represents the vanguard in this struggle to try new tools to revive American schools .
Unless we succeed in that effort and get more students through high school and into college , no bank bailout or stimulus package will be enough to preserve America ’s global leadership in the long run .
MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
Prosecutors will recommend that a Spanish court drop its investigation of six former officials in the administration of U.S. George W. Bush for alleged torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , Spain 's attorney general said Thursday .
Investigating judge Baltasar Garzon has the final say on whether to proceed or shelve the case .
The claim against the former officials , presented by a human rights group and provisionally accepted last month at the court -- pending an opinion from the prosecutors - threatens to turn the court " into a toy in the hands of people who are trying to do a political action , " Attorney General Candido Conde - Pumpido said at a meeting at a downtown Madrid hotel .
" We undoubtedly cannot support that action , " Conde - Pumpido said .
If alleged torture at Guantanamo is going to be investigated at all , that should be done first in the United States , so that the former American officials would have a chance to defend themselves there , Conde - Pumpido added , according to his press chief , Fernando Noya .
The prosecutors will inform the investigating judge , Baltasar Garzon , of their decision , and the judge would then have to decide whether to proceed or shelve the case , Noya said .
Former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and five other ex-Bush administration officials are accused in the human rights group complaint of allegedly sanctioning torture at the Guantanamo Bay detention center .
The complaint alleges the six former officials were the legal architects of a system that allowed torture of prisoners at Guantanamo , in violation of international law .
The case might still go forward at the court , despite the prosecution opposition , said Gonzalo Boye , a lawyer who filed the complaint for the human rights group .
Boye told CNN that prosecutors earlier opposed the court 's human rights investigations of ex-Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and , separately , the former military regime in Guatemala , but that those cases went ahead anyway .
" It 's up to the resolution of a court as it has always been , " Boye told CNN .
" Garzon has to decide .
This is a jurisdiction decision for a judge , not for the prosecution . "
Boye predicted that once Garzon officially receives notification of the prosecution opposition , it could take the judge a few weeks to decide whether to proceed with the case .
Boye conceded that it makes the case harder without prosecution support .
" It 's a shame the prosecutor is taking this position , but not a surprise , " Boye said .
" They always obey political orders .
They do n't want to be in a bad position in front of the Obama administration . "
Some analysts and bloggers have suggested in recent days that the case could damage relations between Spain 's Socialist government and President Barack Obama 's administration .
But a U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told CNN on Wednesday that a German court once had an investigation of then U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , but that did not hurt U.S. - German bilateral relations .
Garzon accepted the complaint from the human rights group because there were at least four Spaniards at Guantanamo who allegedly suffered torture .
Garzon then sent the matter to prosecutors at Spain 's anti-terrorism National Court , requesting their opinion on whether a crime had been committed .
The 98 - page complaint , filed in March 2008 by Boye on behalf of the Association for the Rights of Prisoners , names Gonzales , who was Bush 's legal counsel when the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba was established as part of the administration 's " war on terror . "
Gonzales later became attorney general .
The complaint also names five other top Bush administration officials : former assistant attorney general Jay Bybee ; former deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo ; former Defense Department general counsel William J. Haynes II , former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith and Vice President Dick Cheney 's former legal counsel , David S. Addington .
Lawrence Wilkerson , a former top aide to Colin Powell , who was secretary of state in the early years of the Bush administration , testified before a House of Representatives subcommittee in June 2008 that the six officials " had a collusion " to develop a legal rationale for the administration 's interrogation policy of detainees .
Yoo , the author of a memo which critics say authorized torture , testified before the same subcommittee soon after in June 2008 , saying that his role in the administration had simply been to provide legal advice .
" We were functioning as lawyers .
We do n't make policy .
Policy choices in these matters were up to the National Security Council or the White House or the Department of Defense , " Yoo testified , according to a Congressional transcript .
Addington proved difficult to pin down when he testified before the same subcommittee on the same day as Yoo last June .
Addington , who by then was Cheney 's chief of staff , delivered a flat " no " in response to a question from New York Democrat Rep. Jerrold Nadler about whether Addington " contributed to the analysis or assisted in the drafting of the August 1 , 2002 interrogation memo . "
But when Nadler followed up with : " You had nothing to do with that ? "
Addington replied , " No . I did n't say I had nothing to do with it . "
Addington never seemed to clarify what , if any , role he had .
Garzon is Spain 's best - known investigating magistrate who issued the precedent - setting arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998 while he was in a London hospital .
Garzon has investigated human rights abuses of former military governments in Chile and Argentina , Islamic terrorists operating in Spain , the armed Basque separatist group ETA , as well as major drug traffickers .
All About Donald H. Rumsfeld • Guantanamo Bay • Alberto Gonzales • George W. Bush
She is Russia 's richest woman , and one of its most despised .
Now Yelena Baturina , who rose from life as a factory worker to become a construction magnate and wife of Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov , is seeking a state bailout – to the joy and consternation of many .
Some are happy to see her suffer .
Since Ms Baturina built her firm , Inteko , into a construction and real estate powerhouse , Moscow 's landscape has been transformed .
Cranes and gaudy buildings line streets that used to house centuries - old buildings and relics of Soviet architecture .
" Anything that slows down the construction that has destroyed much of old Moscow is welcome , " said Kevin O'Flynn , co-founder of the Moscow Architectural Preservation Society .
" Baturina has undoubtedly been a part of that . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But many are up in arms that Ms Baturina , who has fallen off the Forbes list of billionaires after two years as Russia 's first and only female billionaire , could be saved by the state as average Russians continue to see their quality of life deteriorate .
Her latest plan was the erection of Project Orange , a building designed by Lord Foster , on the banks of the Moskva River .
The building , in the shape of a massive peeled orange , would replace the Soviet - era House of Artists , an ugly building but one that carries the heft of history .
There is no word yet whether that project will be delayed as the financial crisis wreaks havoc on the Russian economy , turning the capital into something of a construction graveyard .
How Ms Baturina , 46 , built her fortune is a twisted tale , and one best told carefully .
She is fiercely protective of her image , and , in particular , her relationship with Mayor Luzhkov .
Ms Baturina took her first job at a Moscow factory upon graduating from high school in early 1980s , as the Soviet Union stood poised to enter a slump from which it would never recover .
She soon switched tack , taking a degree from a management university and then holding advisory positions with the Moscow government .
That is how she met her future husband , then an up - and - coming politician who would become the mayor of the capital in 1992 , swept up in a wave of popularity that faded as rumours of corruption grew during his 16 - year rule .
They married in 1991 , the same year Ms Baturina and her brother Viktor founded Inteko .
Viktor Baturin is no longer involved with the firm , after publicly falling out with his sister and suing her in 2007 for wrongful dismissal .
As Mr Luzhkov 's power grew , there were suggestions that Ms Baturina 's own corporate growth benefited .
She has denied , however , that her relationship with Moscow 's mayor has been the reason for her success – she sued ( successfully ) the Russian edition of Forbes , alleging it twisted a quote to imply that her links to power were key to her success .
As Mr Luzhkov undertook the task of remaking the Russian capital , Ms Baturina 's fortunes grew .
Her firm won contract after contract , including federal and municipal ones to build more housing as the capital 's population exploded .
By 2006 , she became the first Russian woman to enter the Forbes ranking of world billionaires , with an estimated fortune of £ 1.6bn .
That fortune rose to £ 3bn in 2008 .
In July of that year , she put down £ 50 m for a 90 - room , 18th - century mansion in Highgate , London .
She has managed to shrug off scandal .
Media reports in the late 1990s questioned how she got a contract to fill Moscow 's Luzhniki Stadium with 85,000 seats , but the deal was never investigated .
With her wealth now estimated to be hovering just below $ 1bn ( £ 710,000 ) , her fortunes have clearly changed .
Last week , Ms Baturina appealed to the government for £ 1bn in loan guarantees .
Her spokesman , Gennady Terebkov , says the guarantees will cover new loans for new projects .
No current projects , he added , would be frozen or delayed .
Analysts say that is hard to believe .
The federal raid on a high - flying firm of defense lobbyists has prompted a few brave Democrats to propose the ultimate reform  an outright ban on the practice of lawmakers ’ customizing budget goodies for contractors who requite with generous campaign donations .
This circular flow of taxpayer money is at the heart of the investigation into the PMA Group of lobbyists .
The firm was created by a former staff member and protégé of Representative John Murtha , the powerful head of the defense appropriations subcommittee .
PMA funneled tens of millions in donations to cooperative lawmakers .
Last year , 104 House members earmarked $ 300 million worth of contracts for PMA clients .
Grateful politicians deny that their gratitude has any impact on their policy decisions  that would be illegal .
Members could do away with all suspicions , and any possible temptations , by signing on now to the cold - turkey proposal of two Democrats , Paul Hodes of New Hampshire and Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona .
It would bar lawmakers from taking contributions from anyone who benefits from their budget earmarks .
As disruptive as this would be for the Capitol ’s quid pro quo as usual , it ’s a needed addition to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s ethics agenda .
Some of her members are warning the anticorruption pendulum that secured their majority may be swinging back toward the Republicans .

Hyperbaric Oxygen for Autism ?
Not so fast
Treating children with autism can be remarkably frustrating for everyone involved .
Its impact on children and their families is life - altering , its cause is unclear , and its therapies are minimally effective at best and costly , dangerous , or exploitative at worst .
It is easy to understand how studies which may show a benefit for afflicted children will rapidly draw attention and proponents , regardless of its plausibility .
One such therapy is hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO ) treatment .
There have been some reports that a minority of children with autism have abnormal blood vessels feeding various areas of their brain , potentially limiting the amount of oxygen available to that area of the brain and possibly causing dysfunction of the affected neurons .
Notice the hedge terms I use ; the evidence is quite weak at this point .
Regardless , if this is true , one might expect better functioning of the oxygen deficient neurons with more oxygen delivered .
Anecdotes exist describing such a response , but until recently no well designed studies had evaluated the claim .
Enter a recent study published in BioMed Central Pediatrics by Rossignol and colleagues " Hyperbaric treatment for children with autism : a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , controlled trial . "
( 1 ) Rossignol randomized 62 children with autism into two groups , one of which would receive two 1 - hour treatments of HBO per day , 5 days per week for 4 weeks , and a control group subjected to the same environment for the same spans of time with a very brief and minimal pressure change to blind the participants to their group .
Children 's outcomes were followed using three behavior scores generated by questionnaires completed by the parents , one of which was also independently completed by the primary care physicians of the children .
The study reports significant improvement in the autistic behaviors of children treated with HBO therapy including better eye contact , improved verbal skills , receptive language , reduced stereotypic behavior , reduced irritability , and globally improved function , among others .
The authors reported 9/30 children in the treatment group " much or very much improved , " vs 2/26 of the controls , and 24/30 in treatment group had any degree of improvement vs 10 / 26 controls .
On its face , this is a very interesting and potentially exciting finding .
A double blinded , randomized , controlled trial with a small but sufficient number of patients studied to make valid statements about the outcome .
This is , in fact , exactly what we proponents of evidence and science based medicine have been asking for , and what a relief it would be to have an effective tool to improve the functioning of autistic children .
Why then am I not overly enthusiastic about the results ?
The first serious concern is the design and execution of the study , which Dr Novella addressed in his blog ( 2 ) .
The numbers involved were not large , the blinding is questionable , there was no follow up beyond the study period , and there may be some conflict of interest for Dr Rossignol .
My second concern is that of biological plausibility .
There are a lot of claims and hand waving in the discussion of the article explaining how HBO therapy may decrease inflammation , improve oxygen delivery , prevent brain ischemia , etc .
However , most of the claims bottleneck down to one common pathway : more oxygen in the bloodstream delivered to the brain .
Instead of getting mired down in detailed discussions of studies which are tangentially topical at best , let 's examine HBO 's ability to increase blood oxygen content .
HBO can without a doubt increase the amount of oxygen in your blood , and the amount of the increase is directly related to the concentration of oxygen being breathed ( room air is 20.9 % ) , and the amount of pressure to which you are subjected .
The pressures and concentrations used in the study , 24 % and 1.3 atm , are quite low , and we can easily calculate how much extra oxygen patients received during the trial ( 3 ) .
If we make the reasonable assumption that the children had normal levels of hemoglobin in their blood and live near sea level , then the controls had ~ 20.7 ml of oxygen in each 100 ml of blood , 98.6 % of which is bound to hemoglobin , 1.4 % dissolved within the blood .
The children given HBO on the other hand would have the underwhelming increase in total blood oxygen content to 21.4 ml of oxygen per 100 ml of blood ( this assumes fully saturated hemoglobin ) .
That 's a 3 % increase in blood oxygen content over baseline that will be lost within seconds of leaving the HBO chamber .
Let me put this minimal increase into perspective .
Given the normal range of hemoglobin for humans ( ~12 - 16 gm /dl of blood ) , healthy people have a blood oxygen content ranging from 17 - 22.5 ml of oxygen per 100 ml of blood .
It 's therefore entirely normal for some healthy people to have 32 % more oxygen in their blood than others , which is an order of magnitude greater variance than the 3 % increase achieved by HBO .
You can look at this another way .
In order for a person with a resting heart rate of 80 to increase their oxygen delivery by 3 % ( all other things being equal ) , they could increase their heart rate to 82.4 beats per minute .
Contrast that to the fact most people can double and athletes can more than triple their oxygen delivery by this mechanism .
A 3 % increase is hardly a taxing demand even in critically ill people .
How about another perspective ?
Living in Denver , I can increase my blood content of oxygen ( or that of an autistic child ) by almost exactly 3 % by descending from Denver 's altitude of 5280 ft down to sea level .
Finally , I can increase an average person 's blood oxygen content by 3 % by providing them with 30 % oxygen , which is easily delivered , portable , and can even be worn 24/7 .
Given all of the compensatory mechanisms your body has in place to ensure that an adequate amount of oxygen gets to your various organs and tissues , each having wildly different and variable oxygen needs , a 3 % increase in blood oxygen content is physiologically insignificant except in the most extreme of conditions .
As the hinge upon which most of Rossignol 's mechanisms of action swing , the scant increase in blood oxygen provided by HBO is implausible at best .
My other concern with this study is the author 's poor handling of the article 's discussion .
Read without an eye to their citations the discussion flows well , however , most of the assertions made by the authors are supported with the weakest of evidence .
Rossignol asserts that children with autism have a high level of baseline inflammation and that hyperbaric oxygen therapy " possesses strong anti-inflammatory properties . "
That autistic children have inflammation as a matter of course is contentious , and I 'll not cover it here .
However , that hyperbaric oxygen therapy can reduce inflammation is a gross misinterpretation of the literature .
Of the three studies cited to support their assertion , one concerned traumatic wounds and two evaluated it as a treatment for forms of colitis .
All three of these scenarios have significant infectious and ischemic components in superficial areas which would indeed be treated by HBO therapy , and could plausibly reduce inflammation .
In the absence of infection or ischemia accessible to HBO treatment , there is no reason to suspect HBO therapy would reduce inflammation , much less that it inherently has " strong anti-inflammatory properties . "
Rossignol also ignores the copious body of literature in cellular , animal model , and human studies which establishes that hyperoxia ( high levels of oxygen ) is one of the more efficient methods of inducing inflammation and oxidative injury , not abating it .
There is therefore scant evidence to support HBO therapy 's ability to reduce inflammation , and ample evidence to be concerned about the induction of inflammation .
To support his hypothesis that HBO therapy improves cerebral blood flow , Rossignol cites just two articles .
The first article is written by Rossignol himself , and is not in fact a research article at all but in fact an opinion piece wherein Rossignol describes the use of HBO therapy in autism ( based upon what evidence ?
This was the first trial of any potential value ! ) .
The second citation was also not a peer - reviewed study but instead an author 's reply to an actual study published in the Lancet that examined the effect of HBO on children with cerebral palsy and found no effect .
Rossignol 's best supportive evidence for this hypothesis appears to be nothing more than speculation .
These criticisms ( and many others I have not expounded upon ) and the lack of physiologic plausibility aside , what if Rossignol is right ?
Well , as the saying goes , " truth will out . "
Rossignol is free to build the case for his hypothesis , others will attempt to replicate his results .
If HBO therapy actually helps autistic children , then the data from well conducted studies will validate it , and we will have gained a tool to help afflicted children and learned something new in the process .
If it does n't , then we should direct the limited resources at our disposal to more promising avenues of autism research .
At this time , HBO therapy remains an expensive , difficult to administer , implausible , and unproven treatment for children with autism .

3 ) Calculating blood oxygen content :
PaO2 ( Pressure of oxygen within arterial blood ) ) =
[( Atmospheric Pressure - H2O Vapor Pressure ) x % Oxygen in atmosphere ] - ( Arterial CO2 / Respiratory Quotient )
Sea Level : [ ( 760 mmHg - 47mmHg ) x 0.2093 ] - ( 40 / 0.8 ) = 100 mmHg PaO2
We can then translate this pressure of dissolved oxygen to the volume of dissolved oxygen by knowing that there are 0.003 mls of O2 per mmHg of O2 dissolved in 100 ml of arterial blood , so :
0.003 x 100 mmHg = 0.3 ml O2 dissolved in every 100 ml of arterial blood at sea level
Hemoglobin binds 1.39 ml of oxygen per gram fully saturated , and has a non -linear saturation curve .
For my calculations I used 95 % saturation at 5280 ft , 98 % saturation at sea level , and 15 gm hemoglobin per 100 ml of blood .
Add the ml of oxygen bound to hemoglobin to the ml dissolved in blood for the total oxygen content .

Last week it was discovered that NVIDIA was redesigning the GTX 295 by reworking things to fit on a single PCB .
While it made sense to do so in that it would lower the manufacturing costs , it made little sense due to the cost of re-engineering the card .
Now it is apparent that NVIDIA has something else up their sleeves .
The redesign seems to be a stepping stone toward the release of the GTX 390 .
The GTX 390 will pair up two of new PCB's , enabling Quad - SLI on a single card .
Yep , you read that right .
While Extra Hardware ( Czech ) received permission to give a quick glimpse of the card , it appears NVIDIA did n't want them to say anything else .
Unfortunately the only real specs they were able to give on the card were that there is a total of 3584 MB of GDDR3 total , which is still 896MB per GPU .
Each PCB has two 6 - Pin power connectors for a total of four .
Other than four GPUs in a single card , perhaps the most interesting feature is the display output on the card .
Each PCB has a single output for a total of two , however the images make it impossible to tell whether they are HDMI or DisplayPort .

Man , Time Warner Cable -- you are some shady players .
Hot on the heels of the ISP 's decision to withdraw DOCSIS 3.0 trials from areas that have rejected its tiered billing plan , we 're hearing that TWC 's teamed up with Embarq to persuade the North Carolina state government into banning community - owned broadband services .
Why ?
Well , turns out the 47,000 residents of Wilson , NC got tired of paying for slow broadband , so the city government launched its own fiber ISP called Greenlight that offers some pretty solid packages ranging from $ 99 for 81 cable channels , unlimited phone service , and 10 Mbps ( down and up ) internet to $ 170 for every single channel including premiums and 20 M bps up / down internet .
( There 's even a " secret " 100 M bps up / down internet plan . )
Of course , these prices blow TWC and Embarq out of the water -- the comparable basic Time Warner plan has fewer channels and less bandwidth for an " introductory rate " of $ 137 -- and rather than compete , the two giants decided to lobby the North Carolina legislature into proposing bills that outlaw community services like Greenlight .
The argument is that the big companies can't turn a profit and compete against a community - owned enterprise that essentially sells service for cost , but we 're not buying it -- if anything , TWC and Embarq can invest the extra profits they 've been earning in other areas into building services that would blow Greenlight out of the water .
Yep , it 's definitely some dirty pool -- does anyone have any positive feelings left for these behemoths ?

U.S. actor Tom Hanks , Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer and U.S. director Ron Howard ( L - R ) attend a photocall to promote the movie " Angels & Demons " , premiering May 15 , at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) in Meyrin near Geneva February 12 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Valentin Flauraud
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Director Ron Howard on Tuesday defended his film adaptation of “ The Da Vinci Code ” author Dan Brown ’s “ Angels & Demons ” from criticism that it smears the Roman Catholic Church , heightening an ongoing battle over fictional depictions of the Vatican .
Howard , who also directed the 2006 movie adaptation of “ The Da Vinci Code , ” posted a blog at The Huffington Post website saying that neither he nor his new movie “ Angels & Demons , ” which debuts in May and stars Tom Hanks , are anti-Catholic .
“ And let me be a little controversial : I believe Catholics , including most in the hierarchy of the Church , will enjoy the movie for what it is : an exciting mystery , set in the awe - inspiring beauty of Rome , ” Howard wrote .
Howard ’s post came in response to an opinion piece in the New York Daily News by Bill Donahue , president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights , last week .
Donahue accused Brown and Howard of “ smearing the Catholic Church with fabulously bogus tales . ”
Last year , the Catholic Church refused to let “ Angels & Demons ” be filmed in churches in Rome because of the Vatican ’s outrage over “ The Da Vinci Code . ”
Howard ’s drama “ Frost / Nixon ” was nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards this year , but lost to “ Slumdog Millionaire . ”
His other films include “ A Beautiful Mind , ” which won the best picture Oscar and best directing Oscar for 2001 , as well as 1995 ’s “ Apollo 13 . ”
Brown this week announced that his follow - up novel to “ The Da Vinci Code ” will be released in September and is titled “ The Lost Symbol . ”
The Swedish duo are set to premiere their new opera in September .
Synth - pop duo
The Knife have revealed further details surrounding their Darwin - inspired opera , After it was announced late last year the group were set to collaborate with Danish theater group Hotel Pro Forma , the fruits of their labour have now been realized : , will open at Copenhagen 's Royal Danish Theatre on September 2nd with additional performances at the venue , and a tour throughout Europe said to be planned .
The show was reportedly inspired by British biologist Charles Darwin 's seminal evolutionary text , which reaches its 150th anniversary this November .
In addition to the literary influence , the opera 's website cites contributions from Planningtorock and Mount Sims as musical collaborators .
The amount of RAM a Computer has critically affects system performance .
The RAM needs are also changing with the new Windows and programs , and applications these days are taking more and more RAM space .
With less RAM , the computers starts using the Hard Drive for temporary data , and thus , the system performance significantly decreases , and it takes more and more time to load programs .
The RAM should also not be too much more than your needs as the extra memory will be useless for your computer .
Thus , to maintain a balance between selecting the RAM amount is of key importance .
The largest problem is that memory needs vary greatly from person to person .
For running casual programs , upto 1 GB of RAM is enough for most .
But for some applications , RAM sizes as much as 8 GB to 16GB are needed .
The amount of RAM needed also vary with the Operating System used .
Here are some recommended sizes of memory for common Windows Operating Systems .
Especially after Windows Vista , the RAM requirements have taken a huge jump .
Here are some recommendations for RAM requirements for Windows Operating Systems .
For detailed requirements for Windows , Click Here .
The base requirements for each Windows is enough to run it properly , but to get a smooth experience , the recommended configurations are the best .
The Maximum RAM is the amount which after which there will be nearly no change in the performance on the system , and are best recommended for high end gaming systems and servers .
You can check yourself if your Computer or Laptop is overworking , if the hard drive LED is constantly flickering it means that all of the resources are being used and you need more space .
This is also reflected by Windows Vista ’s Experience Index for differenct RAM sizes .
As seen , above 2 GB , Windows scale the RAM as equal .
Also , increasing the RAM above 2 GB has nearly no effect in te performance of the system , especially for a casual user .
The increased RAM however is useful for using professional applications .
The area where the most RAM is needed is Computer gaming .
Games these days have increased hardware requirements , and there seem to be improvement in performance no matter how much RAM is added .
Thus , for extreme gaming , RAM sizes between 2 GB to 4 GB are recommended .
Above this size , the effect of increased memory are minimal .
Most of the PCs are used for business applications .
Some business applications are really RAM hungry , and eats up free RAM in instants .
So , professional software usually need bigger RAMs to handle large amounts of data .
A particular case is with Servers which benefits the most .
Here are some professional software benchmarks for easy comparing the RAM system performance .
Another area where a lot of RAM is needed is File Compression .
A large amount of data has to be temporarily stored to be sorted , and then compressed into a single file .
It also benefits from total data bandwidth .
In this case , a combination of RAM is installed running at same speed in Dual Channel configuration .
The results however shows that there is not much disparity in speed with RAM sizes .
Verdict :
The requirements have changed , games and software ’s have become more demanding .
Typically if you are a modest user a 1 GB DDR 2 ram would be sufficient for you , but it his highly recommended to use at least 2 GB of RAM .
As far as gamers are concerned , they should look into the next frontier i.e. DDR 3 RAM .
We say that because DDR 3 RAM operates at a higher frequencies which start at 800 MHz to 1600 MHz while DDR 2 has a range of 400 - 800 MHz .
A computer professional using heavy tools and who has at least 10 - 15 tabs opened at a time or a person who plays games a lot a minimum of 4 GB and 8 GB recommended DDR 3 RAM would do the job .

Human sperm can remain fresh up to 36 hours after a man 's death A New York woman has won a race - against - the - clock legal bid to harvest her dead fiance 's sperm .
Gisela Marrero told a Bronx court her partner had spoken about having another child with her only the day before his death from a suspected heart attack .
She had only 36 hours to collect 31 - year - old Johnny Quintana 's semen before it would have become unusable .
As the couple were unmarried she needed a court order , which was granted just four hours before the deadline .
After the Bronx State Supreme Court approved her request , sperm bank employees raced to a local medical centre , where the body of the dead mechanic , who died on Thursday , was stored .
' Last wish '
Ms Marrero , who has a two - year - old son by Mr Quintana , said : " The day before he passed away , we talked about planning for our future , buying an apartment and having another child , " reported the New York Daily News .
" This was his wish .
It 's the last thing I can do for him . "
There were emotional scenes in the court as Ms Marrero and her dead fiance 's family celebrated Friday afternoon 's decision .
Earlier this month , a mother in Texas won a legal bid to have her dead son's sperm harvested after he died in a fight outside a bar , so she could have the option of carrying out his wish to have children .

On Sunday , the Department of Homeland Security held a press conference to announce that the swine flu outbreak that has spread from Mexico to the US and other countries was being declared an official public health emergency .
Also over the weekend , the World Health Organization convened a meeting of its Emergency Committee to evaluate the situation .
Said Committee has determined that " the current situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern . "
If this language sounds like dispensation to panic , it 's worth stepping back and looking at what led to these declarations and what they mean in practical terms , as the implications of these decisions are far more mild than the language would suggest .
We 'll start where the current version of the swine flu virus apparently did , in Mexico , where dozens have apparently died due to influenza .
That may sound disturbing , but it 's important to remember that most people with the flu evade any sort of public health surveillance — they feel awful for a few days , and then get on with their lives .
As such , it 's impossible to tell what the actual mortality rate among those infected with the virus is .
Complicating this situation further is the fact that not all cases of flu - like symptoms are caused by the flu , and there may be other flu viruses circulating at the same time .
These factors probably explain a number of the suspected cases in other countries that have turned out not to be cases of the swine flu .
By the time a sufficient number of serious cases had occurred in Mexico to alert the public health authorities , the virus was already in the process of spreading beyond its borders .
Fortunately , the US Centers for Disease Control has a good relationship with its Mexican counterpart , and an extensive monitoring system is in place for the flu virus .
The CDC , with the help of some alert medical professionals like a school nurse in New York City , has helped track this specific strain of swine flu as cases appeared in the US .
Others have now been spotted elsewhere in North America and Europe , and there are suspected cases in Australia .
The tracking of the ( now global ) spread of this form of the flu is moving rapidly , so any numbers are likely to be out of date by the time they appear in the press .
So far , most of these cases have occurred in people who have recently traveled to Mexico , but at this point , it 's clear that the infected individuals have had enough contact with others that the virus is likely to have moved beyond that population unless it spreads poorly — and events in Mexico suggest that 's not the case .
The CDC 's monitoring has allowed a number of cases to be identified that might not have otherwise come to light , as very few of the US cases have wound up putting people in the hospital ; so far , all have recovered .
As the CDC's Acting Director Dr. Richard Besser put it , " In terms of detection , what we 're seeing in this country is mild disease — things that would never have been detected if we were n't ramping up our surveillance . "
It 's not clear whether this represents the typical course of the infection or whether some environmental or genetic factor enhanced the severity of some of the cases in Mexico .
Scary language masks practical steps
If none of that quite sounds like a " public health emergency " to you , you 're not alone .
Even the head of the Department of Homeland Security , Janet Napolitano , felt as much .
" That sounds more severe than really it is , " she said when announcing the emergency .
" This is standard operating procedure and allows us to free up federal , state , and local agencies and their resources for prevention and mitigation . "
She pointed out that DHS had declared Obama 's inauguration an emergency of similar severity , as it was the best way under department rules to provide the necessary security for the event .
Clearly , the number of direct parallels between the swine flu and the inauguration is pretty small , but Napolitano and Besser detailed a number of concrete steps that the emergency declaration would produce .
Napolitano pointed out , for example , that the US has a strategic supply of modern antiviral drugs , primarily Tamiflu and Relenza , in a strategic national stockpile .
A quarter of the full treatment courses , or over 10 million of them , were now being released for distribution , meaning that local hospitals should be assured of a basic supply even if there was a public run on the drugs .
Meanwhile , the CDC is taking a variety of practical steps .
These include creating a seed stock of this specific virus so that work could progress rapidly on an immunization should the decision be made that one is needed .
They 're also working with Mexican public health authorities to expand the country 's in - house testing capacity , allowing it to better track the dynamics of the outbreak .
Finally , it 's giving the CDC to chance to highlight its basic information on the swine flu — you 're very unlikely to get it from pork products , for example — and provide some basic ( if obvious ) public health advice : wash your hands often , and stay at home if you 're not feeling well .
The detailed information prepared by the CDC was posted online on Sunday .
Similarly , the World Health Organization 's declaration led the organization to identify a number of areas where further research was needed regarding the behavior and spread of the virus .
It has also called on national health organizations to increase monitoring and reporting so that it can be more carefully tracked .
So , the worrisome language is primarily due to standing rules that make these declarations necessary in order to fully mobilize the needed resources .
Those resources will go to monitoring the dynamics of the spread of this virus , and putting the pieces in place to combat it if it develops into a serious public health concern .
So far , indications are that it wo n't , as the cases outside of Mexico have been mild , and it's not clear that the Mexican fatalities are representative .
In trying to stay on top of the latest news , however , it 's worthwhile noting something mentioned by the CDC's Besser , who said in reference to his group 's website , " because of this speed in which things are progressing , you will at times find inconsistent information , and we 're going to work really hard to make sure that that does n't stay up for long . "
The same can almost certainly said for other media outlets , which are probably getting significant portions of their own information from the CDC in the first place .
Check back later this afternoon when we dive into a bit of the biology behind the flu virus .

You ’ve given your blood , sweat and tears to pay off those credit card bills — but what about your sperm and eggs ?
In a difficult economy , some cardholders are choosing to pay off debt using something they still own outright : their bodies .
These consumers see the cash offered by participation in medical experiments , and sperm and egg donations as a viable way to attack credit card or other debt .
And while an economic downturn may be prompting interest on the part of consumers , that is n’t necessarily viewed as entirely positive by the industries in search of qualified candidates .
Medical test subject
Although there is scant national data on the use of earnings from medical study participation , some consumers say it ’s a solid option for paying off credit card debt .
“ There ’s nothing legal I could do to make as much money as doing a medical experiment , ” says Corinne , a 29 - year - old cardholder from Austin , Texas , who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy .
“ It ’s a good way to pay down debt . ”
Corinne says she participated in about 10 medical studies between 1999 and 2007 for contract research organization PPD , which conducts studies at its Austin clinic to “ determine how new medicines act in the bodies of healthy volunteers . ”
After running up credit card debt by what she describes as living beyond her means — “ making low wages and doing the stuff that young people do , traveling and visiting family ” —
Corinne initially considered medical studies after hearing about the option from co-workers and seeing ads in the newspaper .
The studies she took part in generally required healthy people , who were screened via a complete physical exam .
More people are qualified than accepted for participation , she says , making the process quite competitive .
After making the final cut for studies she participated in , Corinne checked into the testing facility , where she spent 20 days in her longest study and earned $ 6,000 for testing an antibiotic .
There ’s nothing legal I could do to make as much money as doing a medical experiment .

Medical experiment participant
Although the pay is good , participants are hardly going on vacation .
Corinne describes entering a “ militaristic environment ” where participants are told when they can eat and drink and are barred from having coffee , cigarettes or any other medication .
A close eye was kept on participants .
“ Otherwise , you could be drinking coffee or shooting up heroin , ” she says .
Despite the difficulty of being in such a clinical climate , it was n’t all bad .
“ I never had anything that gave me side effects or had any bad reaction , ” Corinne says .
In the end , according to Corinne , cardholders can do pretty well for themselves by taking part .
“ You get a huge chunk of money all at once for not that much time , and you can throw it at debt , ” she says .
As to whether she would do it again , in this economy , her answer is yes .
“ If I get laid off or fired , that will be the first place I go , ” she says .
Sperm donation
Meanwhile , young men may opt for sperm donation as a way to pay off credit card or other debt .
Xytex International , based in Augusta , Ga. , provides human semen to health care professionals and their patients .
Xytex says its donors fall into two categories : college students seeking money for books , tuition and loans ; and young professionals in search of a second source of income .
For those new members of the workforce , “ it ’s possible to imagine that they might be using some of the money to pay down other debt that they might have , ” says Christopher Karow , Xytex ’s chief communications officer .
Although donors are n’t required to share what they intend to do with their earnings , “ donors feel like they are part of the family and share things with the customer service team , ” Karow says
Despite the difficult economy , sperm donation apparently has n’t increased substantially .
“ Even though we ’re seeing people come in to join the program , the number of donors has n’t gone up that much , ” Karow says , noting that becoming a sperm donor can actually be a tough process , requiring both medical testing and a waiting period of a few months before donations begin .
Age or certain other problems could make a potential donor not suitable for Xytex ’s program .
According to Alice Ruby , executive director of The Sperm Bank of California , sperm donation requires a “ complex analysis ” that includes screening the donor for sexually transmitted diseases and a consideration of both the donor ’s personal health and that of his family members , such as any genetic diseases .
Ruby adds that donation also requires an exceptionally high sperm count — something men are often unaware of about themselves before becoming donors — since many sperm die in freezing process using for storage .
You do n’t want to take somebody who ’s desperate because , in the end , it ’s not going to be good for them .

For accepted applicants , payment varies by degree of anonymity .
Donors wishing to remain anonymous are issued a donor number and earn $ 60 per visit , Karow says .
Those who take part in Xytex ’s open donor program receive $ 100 per visit after providing a “ photo span ” that includes pictures of themselves from birth to adulthood .
Those images are then made available exclusively to enrolled patients to aid their quest for the ideal donor .
Egg donation
The earnings from sperm donation are a drop in the bucket compared to what women stand to earn from donating their eggs to hopeful parents - to - be .
Although women who donate their eggs can earn as much as $ 10,000 or more , it is n’t an ideal option for those cardholders solely out to earn some money .
Egg donation requires a commitment involving much more than simply “ going to just drop off your eggs , ” says Patricia Mendell , a licensed clinical social worker and co-chair of the nonprofit American Fertility Association .
Still , the economic downturn seems to be encouraging an interest in egg donation .
“ All agencies report an increase in the number of people applying , ” Mendell says .
Service provider Egg Donation Inc. of Encino , Calif. , has seen applications to become a donor rise from 17 per day in October 2008 to 43 per day currently , according to Chief Executive Officer Andrew Vorzimer .
What do the young women do with their substantial earnings ?
Most commonly , “ they will use these funds to pay down credit card debt , to pay down student loans and just to pay for day - to - day necessities , ” Vorzimer says .
Potential donors are screened medically and psychologically , and the odds of becoming a donor are just one in 10 .
Some women ultimately decide they are not comfortable with donation , Mendell says .
Regardless of the economy , she notes that screening remains key .
“ It still means you have to evaluate the donors , so you ’re not going to be taking donors who are inappropriate , ” she says .
According to donor Carrie Bloedorn , attractive and intelligent donors are especially in demand , with a good match often also relying on genetic traits that are similar with the future child ’s family .
You do n’t just go into this to make a quick buck ; you need to understand the ramifications .
— Carrie Bloedorn
Seven - time egg donor
For the specialists involved in working with potential donors , “ you have to understand the balance between a financial need that they have and understanding the commitment that they have , ” Mendell says .
“ You do n’t want to take somebody who ’s desperate because , in the end , it ’s not going to be good for them , ” she says .
Donors agree .
“ You do n’t just go into this to make a quick buck ; you need to understand the ramifications , ” says Bloedorn , who has donated an impressive seven times in four years thanks to a combination of her robust reproductive system and in - demand genetic characteristics .
Bloedorn became an egg donor back in 2004 after a family member who worked at a fertility clinic indicated her pregnancy with twins marked her as an ideally fertile candidate .
“ Having baby twins is expensive , ” Bloedorn says , adding that the money she earned allowed her to stay at home with her young children .
Now 31 years old and living in Atlanta , Bloedorn is “ coming out of retirement , ” with plans to return to egg donation in order to pay off credit card debt incurred to get her own full - service egg donation agency , Eggspecting Inc. , off the ground .
Bloedorn has $ 15,000 in business - related credit card debt after Chase raised the interest rate on her plastic from 7.9 percent to 12.9 percent despite no financial missteps on her part .
“ If I did n’t start this business , I would n’t need to donate again , ” she says .
Bloedorn is a unique case , however .
AFA ’s Mendell says that donation guidelines indicate that such a large number of donations by one woman are beyond what is medically best .
Acting as a donor requires serious commitment .
Mendell outlines a process involving a two - to three - month time frame for each donation that requires two to three extensive appointments , hormone injections with potential side effects , frequent returns to a clinic for monitoring , an injection to release the eggs and a nonsurgical procedure to retrieve the eggs — which despite being nonsurgical , still requires anesthesia .
Add in potential discomfort after the procedure , and “ there ’s a lot more of a commitment than people sometimes even realize , ” Mendell says .
In the end though , egg and sperm donation provides some wonderful benefits , industry experts say — and not just to the donor ’s bottom line .
“ It really is a win - win situation , ” Mendell says .
“ You ’re getting compensation and helping a couple start a family . ”

It has quietly become something of a green gold rush .
In woods and forests across Britain , wild garlic is being harvested for soup makers , wood sorrel gathered for Michelin - starred chefs , and spruce needles picked to infuse hand - made chocolates .
Harvesting " wild food " , the seasonal salad leaves , nuts , fruit and fungi that grow abundantly across the UK , has led to a new industry in professional foraging for restaurants and a sharp surge in public interest .
They are harvesting - for free - nearly 200 ingredients throughout the year : from common crops such as hazelnuts , brambles and wild strawberries , to dozens of different fungi , through to specialist crops such as elm and lime leaves , or sweet cicely .
Chefs are now paying up to £ 50 a kilo for wood sorrel , with its sharp lemony tang , and £ 40 a kilo for elusive morel mushrooms , handpicked from the forest floor .
In Scotland alone , where the wild food movement is thought to be strongest , the Forestry Commission estimates that wild harvesting , including harvesting lichens and mosses for natural remedies and horticulture , is worth as much as £ 21 m a year .
Its rapid growth - by as much as 38 % since 2001 - has led the commission to launch a campaign this month to promote wild foods with a code of good practice , to ensure the increasing number of foragers harvest carefully and , where needed , with the landowner 's permission .
It is no longer a niche , cottage industry .
The fruit and vegetables wholesaler Fresh Direct , which supplies Harrods , high street cafes , and Michelin - starred chefs , has begun extending its wild harvesting operations from Scotland into England .
The search for wild food mirrors the surge in popularity for home - grown produce , allotments and " guerrilla gardening " - where patches of vacant and under -used inner-city land are converted into al fresco fruit and vegetable patches - championed by chefs such as Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall .
The Dorset - based food writer has promoted the marine equivalent of foraging in forests in his latest River Cottage handbook , Edible Seashore , harvesting wild foods such as cockles , sea beet and marsh samphire from the seaside and coastline .
The survival expert Ray Mears has devoted television series to wild foods on land , and the small Kent - based firm Forager is about to publish a dedicated guide and recipe book on edible plants , The Forager Handbook .
To cope with the surge in demand , the charity Reforesting Scotland has set up a " wild harvesting " trade association supported by the commission and the Scottish government .
" We 've had a huge response from the general public on foraging , " said Emma Chapman , the charity 's project coordinator .
" It ties into environmental concerns : you 're getting a little bit of your food in a low - impact way .
A lot of the salads you get at this time of year have a huge amount of energy associated with them , with refrigeration , transport , being grown abroad and under artificial conditions , and they just do n't taste so good . "
Roger Coppock , the Forestry Commission 's head of business policy development , said one recent survey suggested that well over a million people in Scotland alone had foraged at least once in the past two years .
" That started to reveal that it was n't just a case of cranks and back - to - the - earth type people collecting .
It went right across the spectrum from the unemployed to lords , " he said .
Coppock believes that much more could be taken sustainably from the commission 's land .
" It is nowhere near being over - harvested , " he said .
" There 's an awful lot of potential there . "
Andy Fraser , who runs Fresh Direct Local Scotland , one of the country 's largest wild food suppliers and a subsidiary of Fresh Direct UK , said amateur foragers needed to be very careful about what they picked - some plants and mushrooms could be lethal .
The bestselling author of The Horse Whisperer , Nicholas Evans , was hospitalised after eating poisonous mushrooms picked on a woodland walk near Forres in Aberdeenshire last September .
Fraser believes the Forestry Commission could increase the availability of wild foods by actively sowing its plantations with mushrooms , berry bushes and wild salads .

Hey people - just because Sarah wants to change the sex of the dog to please her daughter does n't necessarily mean that the daughter is a brat .
If you 're going to call anyone anything , direct your insults towards the enabler .
Sarah - if you continue to spoil your daughter in this manner , she will most certainly turn out to be a brat .
I suggest that this may be the time to give her the ' you can't always get what you want ' speech .
If you love your daughter , you will teach her something about virtue , rather than indulge her desire to alter the sexual organs of her pet .
Why we should show some compassion for Ted Haggard
I just watched the HBO documentary film , The Trials of Ted Haggard , produced by Alexandra Pelosi ( which the media seem curiously intent on identifying not as a filmmaker but as the daughter of Nancy Pelosi , the Speaker of the House ) .
The film is a follow - up to her 2007 film Friends of God , in which Haggard was prominently featured just before his downfall from revelations that he had homosexual relations with a male prostitute , with whom he also did methamphetamine .
And all this happened right in the middle of the political debate about gay marriage , in which Haggard condemned homosexuality as an abomination and gay marriage as a sin that should never be legalized .
Now , I enjoy roasting a hypocrite as much as the next person , and I sat down to watch Pelosi ’s film sharpening my typing fingers in preparation for slicing this evangelical hypocrite to pieces , especially after just watching him on Larry King Live , in which he failed to apologize to gays for condemning the very “ lifestyle choice ” he also presumably made .
( In his Christian worldview homosexuality is a choice — a bad choice , a sinful choice , but a choice nonetheless ) .
But I came away feeling some compassion for Ted Haggard , sympathy for the devil as it were .
I do n’t know if Pelosi intended her film to have this effect — I suspect not from her off - camera comments in the film as she follows the fallen preacher around Phoenix selling insurance door - to - door and bumming rooms off friends at which his family can live .
But given what we know about the power of belief , and the fact that this man devoted his entire life and essence to being an Evangelical Christian and all that stands for — which is a lot when you are the titular head of the 30 million - strong National Association of Evangelicals — what a striking conflict his life has been ( and by all accounts still is ) .
By now , most of us know that homosexuality is not a “ choice , ” any more than heterosexuality is a choice .
Asking a gay person “ When did you choose to become gay ? ” makes about as much sense as asking a straight person “ When did you choose to become straight ? ”
The answer is the same : “ Uh ? I did n’t choose .
I ’ve always felt this way . ”
Right , and all the evidence from biology , psychology , and behavior genetics ( twin studies ) points to the fact that most people are born straight , some people are born gay , and some are even born bisexual , and that ’s just the way it is .
In a large population ( and six billion members of a large mammalian species certainly counts ) with considerable variation in most characteristics , it is inevitable that even something as seemingly straightforward ( if you ’ll pardon the pun ) as sexuality will likely show variations on that central theme .
To find peace and happiness in life you have to be true to yourself , and herein lies Pastor Ted ’s conflict :
Being true to himself meant being in absolute conflict with his religion , which was , at the time , not just his faith but his livelihood and the only means he had of supporting his family .
As Upton Sinclair observed : “ It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends on not understanding it . ”
The only resolution for Haggard was to live a secret life , and when that secret was revealed there was no way for him to peacefully resolve his conflict .
And from what was shown in the film and in his public interviews of late , that conflict is still not resolved for the simple reason that if you are gay or bi you cannot simply choose to feel differently , even if you are given such bizarre diagnoses as these suggested by his Christian counselors : “ heterosexual with homosexual attachments ” and “ heterosexual with complications . ”
Haggard ’s response was refreshingly honest : “ I was n’t sure what that meant . ”
Me neither Ted , because it ’s a bullshit diagnosis by people who do n’t understand the psychology of sexuality because their religion is driving the science , and that ’s a recipe for quackery .
Yes , you can choose ( or at least try to choose ) not to act on your feelings ( do n’t go to gay bars , do n’t watch gay porn , etc. ) , but short of a Clockwork Orange scenario of extreme behavior modification protocols ( and even this is unlikely to do the trick ) , Ted Haggard cannot and never will be able to square the circle of his sexual essence with his religion .
Something has to go , and that something is his religion , or at least his religion ’s attitudes about homosexuality .
Christianity needs to change its beliefs about homosexuality and to quit condemning those — even those in its own flock — to a life of guilt , self - loathing , and conflict .
Not only does Ted Haggard need to publicly apologize to the gay and lesbian community for condemning them , his Colorado Springs New Life Church — and Christianity in general — needs to apologize to Ted Haggard for ruining his life , not only by exiling him from his home , community and friends , but by forcing him to live a lie .
The data are in : homosexuality is not a choice .
Christianity needs to follow the data instead of forcing the data to fit its religious dogmas .
In the film you can hear the guilt in Ted Haggard ’s voice and see the self - loathing in his face .
Ted Haggard is a broken man , broken not by his biology but by his religion .
You cannot “ fix ” people ’s biology , but you can change their religion , and it ’s time for Ted Haggard to give up on his religion — and perhaps religion altogether .
Short of that , perhaps one of the most charismatic religious movers and shakers of our time can change his religion from within by standing up to his fellow Evangelical leaders and saying to them ( and to everyone else ) something like this :
I was away in Berlin for a few days , delivering a DOM Scripting workshop to the good people at .
I had a good time , made even better by some excellent Spring weather and the opportunity to meet up with and while I was there .
I came home to find that , in my absence , rev=" canonical " usage has gone stratospheric .
First off , there are the personal sites like and .
Then there are the bigger fish :
Excellent !
I ’d just like to add one piece of advice to anyone implementing or thinking of implementing rev=" canonical " : if you are visibly linking to the short url of the current page , please remember to use rev=" canonical " on that A element as well as on any LINK element you ’ve put in the HEAD of your document .
Likewise , for the coders out there , if you are thinking of implementing a rev=" canonical " parser — and let ’s face it , that ’s a nice piece of low - hanging fruit to hack together — please remember to also check for rev attributes on A elements as well as on LINK elements .
If anything , I would prioritise human - visible claims of canonicity over invisible metacrap .
Actually , there ’s a whole bunch of nice metacrapital things you can do with your visible hyperlinks .
If you link to an RSS feed in the BODY of your document , use the same rel values that you would use if you linked to the feed from a LINK element in the HEAD .
If you link to an MP3 file , use the type attribute to specify the right mime - type ( audio / mpeg ) .
The same goes for linking to Word documents , PDF s and any other documents that are n’t served up with a mime - type of text / html .
So , for example , here on my site , when I link to the RSS feed from the sidebar , I ’m using type and rel attributes : href= " / journal/rss " rel= " alternate " type=" application / rss+xml " .
I ’m also quite partial to the hreflang attribute but I do n’t get the chance to use that very often — this post being an exception .
The rev=" canonical " convention makes a nice addition to the stable of nice semantic richness that can be added to particular flavours of hyperlinks .
But it is n’t without its critics .
The main thrust of the argument against this usage is that the rev attribute currently does n’t appear in the HTML5 spec .
I ’ve even seen people use the past tense to refer to an as - yet unfinished specification : the rev attribute was taken out of the HTML5 spec .
As is so often the case with HTML5 , the entire justification for dropping rev seems to be based on a decision made by one person .
To be fair , the decision was based on available data from 2005 .
In light of recent activity and the sheer number of documents that are now using rev=" canonical " — Flickr alone accounts for millions — I would hope that the HTML5 community will have the good sense to re-evaluate that decision .
The document outlining the design principles of HTML5 states :
When a practice is already widespread among authors , consider adopting it rather than forbidding it or inventing something new .
The unbelievable speed of adoption of rev=" canonical " shows that it fulfils a real need .
If the HTML5 community ignore this development , not only would they not be paving a cowpath , they would be refusing to even acknowledge that a well - trodden cowpath even exists .
The argument against rev seems to be that it can be confusing and could result in people using it incorrectly .
By that argument , new elements like header and footer should be kept out of any future specification for the same reason .
I ’ve already come across confusion on the part of authors who thought that these new elements could only be used once per document .
Fortunately , the spec explains their meaning .
The whole point of having a spec is to explain the meaning of elements and attributes , be it for authors or user - agents .
Without a spec to explain what they mean , elements like P and A do n’t make any intuitive sense .
It ’s no different for attributes like href or rev .
To say that rev is n’t a good attribute because it requires you to read the spec is like saying that in order to write English , you need to understand the language .
It ’s neither a good nor bad thing , it ’s just a statement of the bleedin ’ obvious .
Now go grab yourself the very handy bookmarklet that has written for auto - discovering short urls .

Please welcome Reactor , a reactor library with the very original name of " Reactor " .
What is a reactor any way ?
A reactor library is one that provides an asynchronus event handling mechanism .
Ruby already has a couple of those .
The most prominent are EventMachine and Rev .
Many high performing Ruby applications like Thin and Evented Mongrel are utilizing EventMachine for event handling .
Both Rev and EventMachine build atop native reactor implementations written in C or C ++.
While this ensures high performance it makes some integration aspects with Ruby a bit quirky .
Sometimes
even at a noticable performance cost .
This is why I thought of building Reactor .
A much simpler reactor library in pure Ruby that attempts to use as much of the Ruby built in classes and standard libraries as possible .
It only provides a minimal API that does not attempt to be so smart .
It differs from EventMachine and Rev in the following aspects .
Pure Ruby , no C or C++ code involved Very small ( ~100 lines of code )
Uses the vanilla Ruby socket and server implementations
Decent ( high ) performance on Ruby 1.9.1
Ruby threading friendly ( naturally )
You can have multiple reactors running ( like Rev and unlike EventMachine )
require ' reactor '
require ' socket '
reactor = Reactor :: Base.new
server = TCPServer.new ( " 0.0.0.0 " ,8080 )
reactor.attach ( : read , server ) do |server |
conn = server.
accept
conn.write(conn.gets )
conn.close
end
reactor.run # blocking call , will run for ever
Usage is simple , here 's a simple Echo server that uses Reactor
The server is a normal Ruby TCPServer .
It attaches itself to the reactor and asks to be notified if there is data to be read on the wire .
A block is provided that will handle those notifications .
Alternatively , the server can implement a notify_readable method that will be fired instead .
Any IO object can be attached to the reactor but it does n't make much sense to attach actual files since they will block upon reading or writing anyway .
Sockets and pipes will work in a non-blocking manner though .
Reactor is using Ruby 's IO. select behind the scenes .
This limits its ability to scale in comparison to something like EventMachine or Rev which are able to utilize Epoll and Kqueue which scale much better .
This is not a major concern though .
Most servers listen to a few fds most of the time , which is a bit faster when using select .
Besides one can hope that Ruby will be able to use Epoll and Kqueue some day which will translate to direct benefit to Reactor .
Thanks to a freedom of information request by justice spokesman David Howarth , police have revealed a list of 2,000 items confiscated from protesters at the Climate Camp protest at England ’s Kingsnorth coal plant last August .
[ social_buttons ]
A clown outfit , children ’s crayons , soap , books , tents , bicycle helmets , and other seemingly random items were deemed “ potentially harmful ” by police at the scene .
Howarth issued this statement calling the police ’s actions unnecessary and cruel :
It is not the police ’s job to confiscate protesters ’ banners , pensioners ’ walking sticks and children ’s crayons .
The police admit that almost all the items seized had a legitimate purpose .
The idea that it is appropriate to seize ordinary people ’s property on the off - chance that it might be used to commit a crime is a dangerous precedent .
Almost anything can be invested with sinister intent with enough imagination .
I even heard of one case where police confiscated a camper ’s soap on the basis that it could be used to make them slippery and evade capture by police .
This is simply farcical .
This kind of pre-emptive policing is out of all proportion to the threat posed by environmental direct action and should not be acceptable in a democratic society .

No more freezing hikes in Appenzell Innerrhoden
The tiny Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden has voted to prohibit the phenomenon of naked hiking .
Anyone found wandering the Alps wearing nothing but a sturdy pair of hiking boots will now be fined .
Appenzell is considered one of the most conservative regions of Switzerland ; it gave women the vote only in 1990 .
Locals have been outraged by an apparent upsurge in hikers who think the best way to appreciate the mountains is with their clothes off .
The vote was taken with a show of hands at Appenzell 's annual Landsgemeinde , an open - air meeting of all registered voters held in the town square .
Appenzell is one of only two Swiss cantons that still decide local government policy in this way .
There was a big majority in favour of prohibiting naked hiking , and introducing fines of Sfr 200 ( $ 175 ) .
Inappropriate Among local people , it is hard to find anyone who has a good word to say for the hikers .
I meet people from time to time , but they always say hello , sometimes they ask are n't you cold
Naked rambler " I think it 's disgraceful , " said one elderly gentleman .
" God may have created us naked , but he gave us clothes to walk around in . "
" It 's just not right , " said a woman .
" Not at all appropriate for our country . "
Interestingly , however , no - one actually seems to have seen a naked hiker .
" No , I 've never seen one , " said a local farmer .
" Thank goodness , because if I had they would certainly have got a piece of my mind . "
Hiker disappointment Among naked hikers themselves , there is disappointment at what they see as an over - reaction to an innocent hobby which disturbs no - one .
" I 'm not out to annoy anyone , " insists one of them , who goes by the colourful pseudonym of Puistola Grottenpösch .
Not everone in Appenzeller wants to go nude in public Puistola and many other naked hikers may be comfortable baring their all up in the mountains , but the controversy in Appenzell has made them very shy about revealing their real names .
" For me hiking naked is all about getting out into natural surroundings , peaceful surroundings , and challenging myself a little bit , " says Puistola .
" Of course I meet people from time to time , but they always say hello , sometimes they ask are n't you cold .
But they 're just as friendly as if I was wearing clothes . "
Nevertheless , as Puistola strides along a snowy hiking trail wearing nothing but a hat , gloves , and hiking boots , it 's hard to see what the attraction of naked hiking really is .
" Of course the human body needs protection , " he concedes .
" So right now I 'm wearing hiking boots and gloves and a hat , because it 's a little bit chilly .
And if it 's really cold , or windy , or wet , then of course going naked just does n't work , and I wear clothes just like everyone else .
" But right now it 's nice , there is a gentle breeze , and I can feel the Sun on my body ; you can't because you 're dressed . "
Legal doubts
Meanwhile some Swiss lawyers are describing Appenzell 's decision to prohibit naked hiking as akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
" I estimate there are only around 20 to 25 naked hikers in the whole of Switzerland , " says lawyer Daniel Kettiger .
" So really arresting them and fining them is a bit silly .
And our courts do have better things to do . "
What 's more , Mr Kettiger points out , Appenzell may have over - reached itself legally in deciding to introduce a prohibition .
" The Swiss parliament voted to remove public nudity from the penal code in 1991 , " he explains .
" So at a federal level , naked hiking is not punishable , and Appenzell 's laws are not higher than the federal ones . "
Image damage But Appenzell is determined to go ahead .
The canton has some of the most stunning mountain scenery in Switzerland , and its tourist board has been running a high - profile international marketing campaign , highlighting the beauty of Appenzell 's hiking trails .
Tourist officers were concerned to discover that Appenzell was regularly appearing in the internet chatrooms of German nudist groups , describing it as the best place for naked hiking .
The canton was keen to stamp out nude hiking before the summer
This was not the image they were hoping for , and , Daniel Kettiger suggests , it might be the real reason behind Appenzell 's ban on naked hiking .
" They really did a great job building up the hiking tourism , " he explains .
" And I think they fear naked hikers could harm their image .
They want to be a Mecca for hikers - but not a Mecca for nude hikers . "
Appenzell Innerrhoden 's decision is being watched closely by other alpine regions of Switzerland , and the political climate for naked hikers does seem to be turning decidedly chilly .
Neighbouring Appenzell Outerrhoden is also proposing a ban on what local politicians call " shameless behaviour " .
And just over the mountains in canton Glarus , there is nervousness that if naked hikers are driven out of Appenzell , they may choose Glarus as their next favourite spot .
But Puistola Grottenpösch and his fellow hikers are defiant , believing they have Swiss federal law on their side .
" We naked hikers have never broken any law with our hobby , " he insists .
" And we will fight up to the highest federal court for our right to be naked in public , even in Appenzell . "

The US Arms Both Sides of Mexico's Drug War By Lora Lumpe Covert Action Quarterly , Summer 1997 , Number 61 , pp. 39 - 46 .
Mexican narcotraffickers and other criminals easily obtain their firepower north of the border .
Effectively reducing the flow of illegal arms would mean tightening laws on gun sales and ownership in the US .
Instead , the Clinton administration increasingly militarizes Mexico 's drug war , by providing more weapons aid and encouraging the military to become more involved .
On March 14 , when federal agents opened two crates in a " left cargo " hold at the Otay Mesa border crossing near San Diego , California , they uncovered the largest illegal shipment of arms ever intercepted in the United States en route to Mexico .
The weapons - thousands of unassembled grenade launchers and parts for M2 automatic rifles - had been sitting unclaimed for two months .
The discovery was a PR godsend for the Mexican government , following as it did on the heels of an embarrassing disclosure in February that Mexico 's top drug enforcement official was on the take from narcos , and a messy skirmish between the White House and Congress about whether to " certify " Mexico as acting in good faith to counter drug trafficking .
Mexico
City quickly used news of the weapons cache to turn the spotlight away from its drug scandals and focus it on America 's gun problem .
No doubt stung by daily criticism from Washington , Mexican officials were less than diplomatic :
We 're simply not satisfied " with US efforts to stem the flow of arms into Mexico , said Marco Provencio , assistant undersecretary of foreign relations .
1 The Mexican ambassador to Washington , Jesus Silva - Herzog , complained , When we talk about drugs they say it [ the problem ] is supply , and when we bring up alms they respond that it 's the demand .
In other words , we can never win .
" 2 Let 's Outlaw Illegal Guns
It was not the first time Mexico had protested the flow of weapons .
For several years now , that government has pointed out that Mexican drug cartels ( and other criminals ) are getting their arms north of the border ; for several years , Mexico City has asked that Washington take effective steps to address this issue .
Washington has responded in several ways .
First , successive administrations have downplayed Mexican concerns or labeled them as disingenuous -- simply an effort to deflect attention from Mexico 's official corruption and inept war on drugs .
More recently , the Clinton administration has seemingly acknowledged the link between the gray and black arms markets and narcotrafficking , at least rhetorically .
In his keynote speech before the 50th UN General Assembly , for example , President Clinton focused on the global threat posed by terrorism , organized crime , and drug trafficking .
4 Noone is immune , not the people of Latin America or Southeast Asia , where drug traffickers wielding imported weapons have murdered judges , journalists , police officers and innocent passersby , " said the president .
Citing the facility with which these groups obtain the weapons needed for their operations , Clinton urged states to work with Washington " to shut down the gray markets that outfit terrorists and criminals with firearms .
In addition , over the last year , Mexican police and US agents have stepped up cooperation , communication and intelligence - sharing on gunrunning and on tracing weapons used in crime .
And , at their summit in early May , Presidents Clinton and Zedillo redundantly agreed to Outlaw the trafficking in illegal arms . " 3 Fighting Fire with Firepower
It 's easy for the Clinton administration to oppose illicit arms trafficking in principle ; it 's a motherhood issue .
But missing from the speechifying is any mention of the US role as a one - stop shop for drug runners ' guns -- or concrete steps likely to staunch the flow of arms .
Given that America 's loose gun sale and gun ownership laws facilitate the vast majority of weapons smuggled across the border , the willingness of the administration to take effective action is far from clear .
Domestic gun control - considered too politically sensitive , even in the context of the alleged threat to national security posed by drug trafficking -- is not part of the discussion .
4
Instead , the administration has concentrated on providing the Mexican military with firepower sufficient to counter that of the drug bandits .
The relationship between the two militaries has warmed dramatically in the past year , following a visit by Gen. Barry McCaffrey , the White House drug policy director , to Mexico in March 1996 .
His meeting smoothed the way for an agreement between the two governments which has resulted in Mexican soldier straining at Fort Bragg and other US bases , and in the gift of 73 Surplus " helicopters , night vision goggles , radios and other military equipment .
In addition , the White House has requested $ 9 million in military aid for Mexico for fiscal year 1998 ( up from $ 3 million in fiscal year 1996 ) for the purchase of new weapons from US arms manufacturers .
5 More Firepower
The links between arms and drug trafficking make the problem worse .
Drug authorities estimate that up to three - quarters of the cocaine entering the United States now comes through Mexico , as do tons of marijuana annually .
Mexican narcotraffickers are believed to take in as much as $ 30 billion per year for their role in this traded In March1996 , Thomas Constantine , the chief of the US Drug Enforcement Administration testified that the Mexican drug cartels were so wealthy and powerful that they now rival the government for influence and control in many regions .
Increasingly , the narcos are outgunning Mexican drug agents .
Drug traffickers killed more than 200 police last year alone .
7
The Border Patrol reported 24armed encounters and assaults on agents in its Del Rio sector during the first eight months of 1996 , including a January shootout with a Mexican drug trafficker near Eagle 's Pass , Texas in which a Border Patrol agent was killed .
There were eight armed encounters during the same time period in1995.8
According to a Mexican official ,
The firepower of the narco - traffickers so superior to that of the federal agents that they [ the narcos ] have become increasingly brazen .
These people are getting their weapons from the US .
That does n't mean necessarily that they are American weapons , but ... one issue that can help is lowering the access to these weapons . " 9
Not just the police are coming under fire .
Thousands of Mexican citizens are getting caught in the crossfire .
According to the US Centers for Disease Control , Mexico has one of the highest firearm homicide rates in the world , about 10 for every 100,000 people .
( The rate for the United States is 7 per100,000 people . ) 10
In addition , there has been a spate of recent high - profile political and narco - assassinations , many of them carried out with guns purchased illegally in the US .
In 1993 , the Cardinal of Guadalajara , Jose Posadas Ocampo , was gunned down in a drug - gang shootout with a weapon smuggled across the US border .
A year later , PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated in Tijuana with a .38 - caliber Taurus pistol also purchased illegally north of the border .
Just months after Colosio 's murder , Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the secretary general of the ruling PRI , was shot and killed .
This past January , Hodin Armando Gutierrez Rico , a former special prosecutor on the Colosio case for the Attorney General 's office , was cut down in a hail of bullets in front of his Tijuana home .
Police found more than 130 AK - 47 assault rifle shells and 9 mm bullet casings .
Five officials linked to the Colosio investigation have now been assassinated .
Gun seizures by Mexican officials have increased dramatically in recent years , but it is difficult to know whether this is because of absolute increases in numbers of weapons in Mexico , or to improved efficiency on the part of the authorities .
Road checkpoints have turned up large quantities of drugs , arms , and other smuggled goods .
11 Mexican police seized 16,000 pistols and 6,000 shotguns , mostly from drug gangs in 1994 - 95 , and more than 7,200 illegal weapons in 1995 in non-drug related crimes ( up from 28 in 1992 ) .
12 Last October , Mexican officials asked The White House has requested $9 million in military aid for Mexico for the purchase of new weapons from US arms manufacturers .
the US Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( BATF ) to trace the origin of nearly 4,300 side arms and semiautomatic and automatic rifles confiscated from drug - related crime scenes .
13
Since then , Mexico has submitted 1,500 additional trace requests .
14
In August 1994 , just months before his brother fell to an assassin 's bullet , Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu ( now in jail in the US , awaiting trial on drug - related charges ) , said , " We track the dealer and determine from where the shipment originates .
[ The guns ] generally originate from US citizens and end up most of the time in the hands of gangsters , thieves , and other criminals , rather than organizations such as the Zapatista National Liberation Army . "
Situated in the southern part of the country , Mexico 's leftist rebel armies appear to be getting their arms principally from enormous stores left over from the Central American wars of the 1980s .
Many of those arms were , of course , supplied by Washington , too , either through massive military aid programs or as part of covert government operations .
According to a report by the attorney general 's office last fall , arms from north of the border are mainly being used in street crimes , such as holdups , kidnappings , and murders .
15 The Profit Motive Proximity , liberal gun sales laws , and inadequate law enforcement have made the US Mexico 's leading source of black market arms - despite Mexico 's own strict gun control policy .
Mexican law bars civilian ownership of any gun larger than .22 - caliber ; requires a permit before purchase ; mandates the registration of firearms with the Ministry of Defense ; and bans carrying weapons in public .
Although Mexico has produced military - style assault rifles under license from European gun manufacturers , it does not make or sell weapons approved for the general population .
Just over the border , however , regulation is loose and manufacture of guns is big business .
In 1990 alone , civilian firearms sales amounted to a staggering $ 2.1 billion , with wholesale ammunition sales of $ 491 million in 1992.16
There are an estimated 250 million firearms circulating , and over 245,000 federally licensed firearms dealers selling guns to the general public .
Ten percent of these ( 24,567 ) licensed gun sellers are in the four states bordering Mexico , and more than 6,000 sit along the border between the two countries .
17
While it is illegal in the US for any person or company to export or conspire to export a weapon without obtaining a license from the government ( either the Commerce or State Department , depending on the type of weapon ) , the US is a major source of small arms and light weapons for illicit buyers around the world .
Of the five or six million firearms purchased annually in the US by private buyers , a certain percentage is acquired by middlemen working on behalf of arms traffickers who smuggle them across the US - Mexican border in violation of both countries ' laws and regulations .
Many of the arms used by Mexico 's insurgencies were supplied by Washington either through massive military aid programs or as part of US covert operations that left enormous arsenals behind .
Gun trafficking entails significant risk of punishment for those caught , but rewards those who succeed with big , or at least relatively easy , money .
The going rate to smuggle one gun into Mexico is reportedly about $ 10018 , and annual reports by the BATF 'S International Traffic in Arms program indicate that the task is not overly difficult .
In 1994 , foreign governments reported 6,238 unlawfully acquired US - origin firearms to the BATF .
Over half - - 3 , 376 - - were discovered in Mexico.l9
The chances of being prosecuted for arms trafficking on the north side of the border appear pretty low .
Despite the enormous quantities of US - origin guns illegally circulating in Mexico , a US Department of Justice ( DoJ ) document listing " Significant Export Control Cases " from January 1981 to June 1995 shows that , in this 15 - year span , the DoJ prosecuted only two cases .
One , in 1989 , involved a conspiracy to export 190 AK - 47 assault weapons and a large quantity of ammunition , and the other concerned a conspiracy to purchase and export a large quantity of weapons , including M - 16 rifles , grenades , and antitank rockets , for use by drug traffickers in Mexico in 1990.20 Mexico 's Firearms and Explosives
Act stipulates harsh penalties for crimes connected with the possession and use of all types of weapons , as well as their illicit trade .
Shipping Through Customs Gunrunners , like their product , come in all calibers .
Some are free - lance petty criminals looking for a quick buck .
But much of the traffic is just one part of large - scale organized criminal operations .
According to a report last fall by the Office of the Attorney General of Mexico , gunrunning is the third richest source of profit for organized crime in Mexico , after drug trafficking and robbery / extortion .
The report states that no criminal group has been found to be " strictly and exclusively dedicated to arms trafficking " but , rather , that drug trafficking organizations are running guns through the routes to / from the US under their control .
It cites flourishing gun / drug routes along the Pacific coast , the Gulf coast , and Central Baja and adds that a " significant " amount of arms trafficking originates out of central Florida , crossing through the Caribbean and entering Mexico through the Yucatan Peninsula .
The narcos generally traffic in AK - 47 , AR - 15 , and M - 1assault rifles .21
Large and well - organized arms shipments like that uncovered near San Diego in March are thought to be unusual , but no one really knows , since understanding of black market gunrunning is based largely on transactions that have failed .
In this cases several months before their Otay Mesa discovery , the weapons had entered the US through the port of Long Beach , California , in two large , sealed containers .
The shipment originated in Vietnam , where America , as part of its war legacy , had left behind large quantities of weapons , including M - 2 automatic rifles .
22
Before the arms returned home , they were well - traveled , having gone from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore to Bremerhaven , Germany , through the Panama Canal and up to Long Beach .23
The contents of the containers were falsely represented as hand tools and strap hangers .
US Customs at Long Beach did not inspect the , cargo since the shipment was " in - bond " -- that is , the items were simply transiting the US enroute to another country , in this instance Mexico .
In such cases , cargo containers typically remain sealed as they moved from ship to truck to border .
According to a Customs source , " in the normal course of business , no one Canal and up to Long Bach .
would have ever opened them .
[ The arms ] were discovered through a fluke . " 24 ( The shipment was held up at the border because the Mexican freight forwarder commissioned to get the crates to Mexico City did not have an address for the purchaser . )
The in - bond system is built on trust , and on the Customs Service 's lack of resources .
Customs has fewer than 135 inspectors at the port of Long Beach , the nation 's busiest port , to sift daily through the equivalent of 8,400 20 - footcargo containers .
25 The Trail of Ants
The most routine way of smuggling arms , however , is the hormiga ( ant ) run : repeated trips across the border with one or a few guns .
A legally eligible or " straw " purchaser buys a few weapons ( often cheap .
22 - and . 25 - caliber pistols , " 38 specials , " and 9 mm pistols ) from gun stores in El Paso and other US border towns and hands the mover to the trafficker , who sneaks them across the border , generally either on foot or in the trunk of a car .
A smuggler can repeat this process hundreds of times a year , making multiple trips to gun stores in Florida , Texas , and California , in particular .
Some legal constraints are now in place , but lack of investigative and regulatory resources reduces their efficacy .
The Brady Bill " mandates a five - day waiting period , and a recently enacted rule requires purchasers to show that they have lived for at least three months in the state where they are buying a gun .
In addition , the Firearms Owners Protection Act of1986 ( sponsored by the NRA ) requires that multiple sales be reported to the BATF and local law enforcement agencies , so that they can monitor multiple gun purchases and investigate if they suspect criminal intent .
But currently only three states -- Virginia , Maryland , and South Carolina - - have laws that prevent people from buying more than one gun a month .
In all other states , straw purchasers can buy significant quantities of guns and ammunition from gun dealers at one time and pass them on to smugglers for clandestine shipment .
A 1991 BATF report describes a number of such transactions , including a 1989 case in which three Arizona residents purchased 93 assault rifles and 22 handguns for a well - known Mexican narcotics trafficker , who then transported them into Mexico .26 44 CAQ SUMMER 1997
And once the guns are acquired in the US , there is little to keep them from crossing the 2,000 - mile - long border .
Because Mexican border officials have a general policy of not checking people who enter on foot , many Mexican smugglers hide guns in suitcases , backpacks , or Ruffle .
Gunrunners who drive across conceal weapons under seats or inside false compartments .
Although border police run random spot checks of cars coming south , these traffickers run relatively little risk .
Firearms are also smuggled on commercial flights .
According to a US Customs survey conducted at the Los Angeles International Airport ( LAX ) , gunrunners often wrap the firearms in foil and then put the min their checked baggage .
Smugglers also hide weapons in television sets or other electronic components and ship them either as air freight or as personal luggage .
In 1989 , US Customs officers recovered 463 firearms at LAX.27
It can probably be assumed that many more guns escaped detection there and at other US airports .
Where the Guns Are Willie Sutton explained , when asked why he robbed banks , " because that 's where the money is . "
In that spirit , many gunrunners go to military and police facilities on both sides of the border to get arms .
In 1993 , the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) found that small arms parts were routinely stolen from a number of military repair shops and warehouses .
The hot parts were then sold to gun dealers or to walk - in customers at gun shows around the US .
GAO investigators were able to purchase military small arms parts at 13 of 15 gun shows they visited .
They were able to buy everything needed to convert a semiautomatic AR - 15 rifle into a fully automatic M - 16 , as well as 30 round M - 16 magazine clips still in their original packages .
28 Some of these arms undoubtedly end up south of the border .
In Mexico , narcotraffickers and other criminals probably also get a substantial amount of US arms from Mexican police and military depots , either through theft or purchases from corrupt state servants .
In 1991 , the Pentagon gave Mexico nearly 50,000 M - 1 rifle carbines , 29 and during 1989 - 93 , the State Department approved 108 licenses for the export of more than $ 34 million of small arms to Mexico .
The Department performed only three follow - up inspections to ensure non-diversion of these arms .30 During 1991 - 93 , the Commerce Department approved an additional 34 licenses for the export of over $ 3 million of shotguns andshells .
31
End use checks are even rarer on Commerce - licensed arms .
Supply and Demand , American Style Shutting down an illicit market is , of course , difficult : Reducing supply , with out also reducing demand , might simply make the market more lucrative and encourage more people to enter it .
Nevertheless , there is much that the US could do to make it more difficult for Mexican and other criminals to obtain firearms in America .
The Brady Bills ( requiring a five - day waiting period and criminal check prior to gun sales ) and the current ban on sales of assault rifles have complicated business for gunrunners .
A national law limiting customers to one handgun purchase per month would , according to BATF findings , help curb the multiple - gun straw purchases that often end up on the black market .
There is also a need to increase resources for Customs intelligence and inspections , and for the State Department and Customs Service to undertake more frequent " end use " inspections to ensure that legally transferred small and light arms are not diverted .
All of these steps address supply , but ignore the root causes of the tremendous demand for lethal firepower .
Crime , and related gun use , among small - time criminals is often fueled by desperate social conditions - lack of jobs , hopelessness , and poverty .
In Mexico , every year 158,000 babies die before 5 years of age because of nutritionally related disease .
With the country gripped in its worst recession since 1932 , as many as 40 percent of all Mexicans suffer from some degree of under nutrition .
A report by the nation 's top private bank , Banamex , found that as a result of the economic crisis , half of Mexico 's 92 million people get less than the 1,300 minimum daily requirement of calories .
32
Not unexpectedly , the crime rate in Mexico has soared since the collapse of the national economy in 1995 , with an average of 543 crimes per day reported in Mexico City .33
And organized crime , the biggest traffickers and consumers of illicit weapons , thrives on the drug trade .
Meanwhile , gathering information on gun violence and gun ownership laws within the hemisphere is an important step ( see p. 43 ) , as are devising common export guidelines and enhancing Customs surveillance and cooperation .
But as long as the United States has by far the most permissive gun sales policies in the hemisphere , it will continue to supply drug - runners and criminals of all stripes .

Global Gun Glut
The problem of the proliferation of illicit arms is drawing fire from numerous international regulatory bodies .
International police and customs entities ( Interpol , the World Customs Organization , Inter - American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States ) have recently undertaken useful initiatives to gather data , educate policymakers and find consensus on steps that can be taken to regulate firearms and curb illicit trafficking .
The US has been participating in all of these efforts , and apparently welcomes them .
The United Nations has also become concerned with the impact of small arms and light weapons on the maintenance of peace .
In September 1995 , the secretary - general called for direct action
To deal with the flourishing illicit traffic in light weapons , which is destabilizing the security of a number of countries . "
In December of that year , the General Assembly established a panel of experts to study the matter ( the UN's idea of direct action ) .
The panel will make its final report in June and is expected to call for greater self - restraint and information - sharing in exports of such weapons .
Also in 1995 , the UN Economic and Social Council( ECOSOC ) undertook a study of Firearms regulation for the purposes of crime prevention and public safety . "
In March1997 , the secretary - general issued a report with the phrase " measures to regulate firearms '' in the title .
Needless to say , the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) is sweating .
In fact , in late 1996 the gun association applied for and was accredited as an officially recognized " non-governmental organization " with the UN , precisely so that it could keep closer tabs on and influence the UN 's efforts .
In a statement prepared for a May ECOSOC commission on crime prevention , the NRA complained that the " current orientation of these [ UN ] efforts regarding firearms regulation is dissipating energy and effort from more pressing and relevant problems , i.e. , illegal arms smuggling as it relates to criminal activity and terrorism . "
When asked specifically what the NRA proposes to do about gun-smuggling , a spokesman said he did n't know what legislation could be passed to curb the problem , given that criminals break the law .
" That 's what criminals do .
" 1 The Organization of American States ( OAS ) is involved in two efforts to tackle the illicit arms traffic in the hemisphere .
The Inter - American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( CICIAD ) provides assistance to OAS member states on supply and demand reduction , legal development , institution - building , and information exchange .
As part of its legal development program , CICAD is drafting model regulations to standardize and Then appropriate , periodically revise laws , regulations , administrative procedures and the means of applying them in order to eliminate the illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms , ammunition , explosives and other related material . "
2
The model regulations should be completed this summer .
In a second and more recent initiative , the OAS is drafting a convention against the illicit manufacturing and trafficking of firearms , ammunition , explosives , and other related material .
The proposed treaty originated with the Mexican government , and the current draft calls on states to adopt legal or other measures necessary to " prevent , combat or eradicate " the illicit production and transfer of firearms and ammunition .
According to Carlos Rico Ferr at of the Mexican Foreign Relations Secretariat , the OAS draft convention will develop a consensus about what kinds of arms are to be considered illegal for international trade , and set rules for notification of arms shipments for both sending and receiving countries , including an annual assessment of efforts by each state party on progress in curtailing illicit arms trafficking .
According to another official , " At this point the exercise is about enhancing the capability of countries to track the issue .
More stringent gun control laws in the US are not on the table right now . "

Obama Launches Review of Secrecy Policy
By Carrie Johnson
President Obama this afternoon directed his national security adviser and senior Cabinet officials to examine whether the government keeps too much information secret .
In a memo , Obama acknowledged problems with excessive classification of documents kept from the public eye for years and affirmed that he remains " committed to operating with an unprecedented level of openness . "
Obama tasked national security adviser Gen. James Jones to canvas executive branch officials about their procedures for handling classified information and to make recommendations about better information sharing .
The president also said that turf battles and technology continued to pose obstacles to dissemination of sensitive but unclassified national security information among federal agencies with their partners in states and the private sector .
To help clear the path , Obama yesterday created a task force to study that and related issues for 90 days , putting at the helm Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
Government officials representing a broad swath of agencies will review procedures for labeling and sharing sensitive information to make sure that the needs of law enforcement , privacy and civil liberties " strike the proper balance , " the memo said .
Obama also proposed the creation of a National Declassification Center to streamline procedures for releasing classified information , when appropriate , under the guidance of the Archivist of the United States .
The broad initiative is in line with an executive order issued by Obama Jan. 21 , when he promised to move forward with " a presumption in favor of openness . "
Steven Aftergood , director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists , praised the move as a way to " set the wheels in motion . "
" This is music to the ears of many of us , " Aftergood said , " but the hard work remains to be done -- how to translate these goals into policies . "

We all know that Kaspersky is a security firm and they make a very nice product , you can see a list of their products here : http://www.kaspersky.com/
What I found out today on twitter is that their site got hacked by a SQL Injection attack .
The tool that was used was the Acunetix Web Security Scanner .
Tools are used by admins to protect their sites but the same tools are also used by hackers to attack your site .
I have written about another such tool Metasploit before here :
Do you use Metasploit to check if your servers are vulnerable ?
People should really take advantage of these tools to check their own site before the hackers do .
I will create a post one of these days with all the tools you can use to check for SQL attacks .
So what actually happened with Kaspersky ?
Here is what ChannelWeb had to say about this
A security vulnerability in Moscow - based Kaspersky Lab’s U.S.
Web site was made public after a hacker launched a SQL attack and posted listings of tables contained on the security company ’s site .
The hacker , known as Unu , posted screen shots as well as a list of tables Feb. 7 to a blog after hacking into the security company ’s Web site via a simple SQL injection attack that allowed information to be exposed by entering secret username and password information .
“ Kaspersky is one of the leading companies in the security and antivirus market .
It seems as though they are not able to secure their own databases , ” the hacker said on a hackerblog.org posting .
“ Alter one of the parameters and you have access to EVERYTHING : users , activation codes , lists of bugs , admins , shop , etc . ”

If you 're a heterosexual man in a long - term relationship but would rather not hear the patter of tiny feet just yet , would you willingly submit to a monthly contraceptive jab in the buttocks ?
The front page of yesterday 's Daily Express trumpeted the development of a " male pill " – a hormone injection that renders men temporarily infertile and is " as effective as the female pill in preventing pregnancy " .
The story reported a phase III clinical trial in China of a testosterone jab involving 1,045 fertile men which found that the treatment caused no significant side effects ( apart from increased libido ) and almost completely suppressed sperm production .
Better still , the men got their fertility back when the injections were stopped .
What the story failed to mention was that out of 1,045 men recruited into the trial , only 733 completed the 30 monthly injections and follow - up .
That 's quite a high drop - out rate , but perhaps not all that surprising given that the men had to present themselves at a clinic every month and drop their trousers to receive the jab .
It probably stung , just a bit .
On top of that , it took several months after the injections began before the men could safely be considered infertile .
To monitor their declining sperm counts the men would also have had to submit regular semen samples .
Around 5 % of the volunteers who made it to the end of the trial never achieved " azoospermia " .
In other words their partners continued to risk unwanted pregnancy , in the absence of another form of contraception .
For them , it had all been a complete waste of time .
All those indignities for nothing .
Two of the men failed to regain their full fertility when the injections were stopped .
The injections may not have been to blame , but it might give a man pause for thought before embarking on such a course of contraception .
The development of a male version of the contraceptive pill is a noble goal , but hormone injections have severe practical and psychological drawbacks for men .
In 2004 I wrote an article for New Scientist magazine detailing some of the alternatives to hormone injections .
Some of them looked very promising .
One of the principal advantages over using testosterone was that they targeted the later stages of sperm production , so their effect kicked in much more quickly .
Unfortunately they were all a long way from reaching the shelves of your local pharmacy , partly because major pharmaceutical companies – whose financial muscle would be essential to take them through hugely expensive clinical trials , without any guarantee of success – would n't touch them with a barge pole .
Very little has changed in the past five years .
What 's a guy to do ?
Amazingly , there did seem to be a highly effective , reversible form of male contraception on the brink of worldwide adoption .
It was a type of vasectomy called RISUG ( Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance ) involving the injection of a gel into the vas deferens .
The gel sets to form a loose polymer that allows the passage of seminal fluid but knocks out sperm .
The procedure is fast , does n't require general anaesthetic and apparently prevents conception for at least 10 years without further maintenance .
The only reported side effect is a slight scrotal swelling and tenderness that resolves after a few weeks .
Flushing the polymer out with sodium bicarbonate immediately restores fertility .
RISUG was invented by an Indian biomedical engineer , Sujoy Guha , and is undergoing phase III clinical trials in India .
Its progress to market was delayed by years when the reliability of earlier toxicology tests in animals was called into question , but it looks as though it 's back on track .
The development of a popular form of male contraception that rivals condoms for effectiveness would be a triumph for sexual equality .
Whether it would match the effectiveness of condoms in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted infections like HIV is another question entirely .

Houses • Sao Paulo , Brazil Architects : Bernardes Jacobsen Architecture
Year Completion year of this architecture project Year : 2007
Text description provided by the architects .
The whole idea of the project was created when Thiago was visiting the site .
There , in front of the client , he sketched what later would be the transverse section of what was being proposed : a vacation house , for a couple and their two kids .
A place where they could invite friends over frequently .
Designed to be a pavilion supported by only five pillars , with en-suites bedrooms , living room (s ) / sitting room (s ) / dining room(s ) , balconies and a pool facing the beautiful sight of Guarujá beach .
Preserved terrain and vegetation .
Facing the street , a low and discrete horizontal façade .
The sea is the main focus of the building 's greatest view , but this did n't follow the best sun orientation .
Willing to take advantage of the great view , the decision to place the pool away from the building was taken , having then the house east facing and the hillside throwing a shadow over the pool .
Due to the terrain 's inclination , a structural deck 18 m above the ground was used as a foundation to the development of a new area .
Also , this deck had to be supported by only five tree - shaped concrete pillars because of the difficulties found on making the structural foundation .
Above this deck the whole structure is metallic , which makes the building process simpler , since it 's all made in loco .
Since the house is detached from the ground , it acts as a big tree shading the smaller ones , keeping the natural process of the forest and preserving it .
This platform consists of the whole social area of the house and a great external deck with the swimming pool lane in its extremity .
The trees where planted in this level , giving a sensation of the house being in the canopy of the trees .
Apparently the house is limited to the two floors above this deck , but actually , most of the plan is placed below it .
The house is accessed from the second floor , where there are two en-suites bedrooms and also the entry hall .
In the bottom floor we have the housekeeper 's house , kitchen , service - area , steam bath , gym and four bedrooms .
The whole house was structured on steel and the doors and windows were made of wood and glass .
The floor surface is covered of wood , giving the sensation of softness , and also making the deck look like floating .
In the areas where their are n't any eaves , the walls are covered with copper and due to the rain exposure , the material will change naturally , making it look even more beautiful .
Inside , wood is the main material , used , for example , on the balcony linings .
Accomplishing such a project was very gratifying for the architects .
A big , large planned house witch disappears in the forest .
A great house almost unnoticed among the trees .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Senior French politicians of all colors roundly criticized Pope Benedict Wednesday for saying the use of condoms was complicating the fight against AIDS .
Benedict made the comment Tuesday as he was traveling to Africa , re-affirming the Roman Catholic Church ’s opposition to condoms .
But French leaders said he had gone too far .
“ I am very worried by what has happened .
I think this is opposite of tolerance and understanding and I am very sorry about it , ” French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said .
Human Rights Minister Rama
Yade said she was “ dumbfounded ” by the Pope ’s comments , saying it risked undermining the fight against AIDS .
Other politicians went further , questioning whether the Pope ’s ability to run the Church .
“ This Pope is beginning to pose a real problem , ” former Prime Minister Alain Juppe was quoted as saying by French television .
Pope Benedict seemed to be “ living in a situation of total autism , ” Juppe said .
Veteran Greens politician Daniel Cohn - Bendit told France Info radio : “ I ’ve had enough of this Pope now . ”
More than 25 million people have died from AIDS since the early 1980 ’s , mostly in sub-Saharan Africa , and some 22.5 million Africans are living with HIV , the virus that causes
AIDS .
The Pope ’s statement when he arrived on a visit to the Cameroon capital Yaounde Tuesday was one of his most explicit on the issue of condom distribution since his election in 2005 .
“ It ( AIDS ) cannot be overcome by the distribution of condoms .
On the contrary , they increase the problem , ” he said .
The comment caused a storm of criticism around the world .
Papal officials said the Pope was reiterating established Church policy .
The Church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage , chastity and abstinence are the best ways to stop AIDS and does not approve condoms .
However , French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Eric Chevallier said condoms played a vital role in AIDS prevention .
“ Along with education and screening , condoms are a fundamental part of actions to prevent the transmission of the AIDS virus , ” he said .
France is traditionally a Catholic country , although less than 10 percent of the population still attend Sunday mass .
However , about 200,000 people turned out for an open - air service in Paris last year when the Pope visited the country and an opinion poll at the time showed a majority of French people had a positive view of the German - born Pontiff .
Christopher A. Curry , 20 , was already in trouble with police when they took him into custody early this morning following a disturbance at Dickinson College .
Curry , 20 , a Dickinson student from Wall , N.J. , was picked up by Carlisle , Pa. , police after he had been detained by Dickinson College public safety officers following a report of an unwanted guest in the first block of South West Street in Carlisle .
According to court documents , police found Curry so intoxicated they determined he was a danger .
He also yelled at officers , court documents state .
Things got worse for Curry , though , when he was taken to the Carlisle police station and placed in a holding cell .
That 's when he broke off the head of a fire suppression sprinkler , damaging the sprinkler head and flooding the entire cell block area , the court documents state .
Currey was charged with institutional vandalism , carrying a false ID , purchasing alcoholic beverages for a minor , public drunkenness and disorderly conduct - unreasonable noise .
He was arraigned in front of District Judge Mark Martin in night court before being released on $ 1,000 unsecured bail .
Curry will have a preliminary hearing at 8:30 a.m. May 13 in front of District Judge Jessica Brewbaker in Carlisle .

One area that has been quite shaky is a good tool that can be used for merging different pdf files into one .
There is a tool called pdftk but its command - line and while i do n’t have a problem using it , its hardly the tool i want to recommend for our staffs and students , so when this morning i saw a dent on identi.ca about a tool called PDF - Shuffler which among other things provide an easy way to merge PDF files i decided to to Investigate .
PDF - Shuffler is a small python - gtk application , which helps the user to merge or split PDF documents .
You can also rotate , crop and rearrange their pages using an interactive and intuitive graphical interface .
Source : Softpedia
I tested it and found pdfshuffler so easy to use that it might amount to waste of space writing about how to use it .
Once you import pdf(s ) its splits it into pages which can be rearrange by dragging them with your mouse , you can also delete any page you do n’t want .
Here is a Screencast
Installation
Debian / Ubuntu users can download a Deb here which can be installed by double clicking on it ( the installer might download other dependencies from the Debian / Ubuntu repositories which the application needs to install but it does this automatically )
Edit : I tried installing this on Ubuntu 8.04 ( hardy heron ) but its threw up some dependencies errors .
which i got round by installing the following packages from the ubuntu 9.04 repositories
http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/python-pypdf/python-pypdf_1.12-1_all.deb
http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/python-pdftools/python-pdftools_0.37-1_all.deb
Everything went fine from then on .
Once installed you can launch it from Application / Graphic / Pdf- Shuffler
Other Linux Distributions
I can either download the source package and compile it from source , or search Google for a package compiled for their distribution for their distribution
Thanks to pete who pointed out that
Since it is a python application people do not need a distribution specific package .
They can just download the source package , unpackage it and run the file “ pdfshuffler ” ( $ python pdfshuffler ) assuming that all required additional packages ( http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/) are installed on the system .
Maybe it ’s worth to tell a little about that .
Advantage is here that even a user without root privileges can run it .
here are the dependencies that pdf - shuffler needs to run
· pyPdf 1.10 or later
· Python
· PyGTK
( I found an rpm for fedora 11 here and one for suse 11 here )
Hope this helps somebody

Roger Friedman loses his job for ‘ promoting ’ piracy
Entertainment writer Roger Friedman is out at FoxNews.com after posting a review of an illegally downloaded version of X - Men Origins : Wolverine last week .
On his column , Friedman seemed to endorse watching pirated DVDs .
According to him , watching pirated movies on a computer is “ so much easier than going out in the rain , ” and that Wolverine “ exceeds expectations at every turn . ”
The article was quickly removed from the site but a copy can be found here .
Fox News is the sister company of 20th Century Fox , the maker of the multimillion - dollar X - Men movie set to debut May 1 .
This afternoon , the company issued the following statement , “ Roger Friedman ’s views in no way reflect the views of News Corporation .
We , along with 20th Century Fox Film Corporation , have been a consistent leader in the fight against piracy and have zero tolerance for any action that encourages and promotes piracy .
When we advised Fox News of the facts they took immediate action , removed the post , and promptly terminated Mr. Friedman . ”
SEOUL —
An economic commentator on the Internet who criticized and angered the South Korean government but commanded a huge following was freed from jail Monday after a court acquitted him of charges of using the Web to maliciously spread false information .
The arrest of Park Dae-sung in January and his trial on charges of spreading false data in public with a harmful intent — a crime punishable by as much as five years in prison — prompted debate about how much freedom of expression should be tolerated in cyberspace in this extensively wired country .
Mr. Park , an unemployed 31 - year - old , gained an almost prophet - like status among many South Koreans after he correctly predicted the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers , the crash of the South Korean currency — the won — and the effects on South Korea of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis .
In some of the hundreds of online commentaries he posted under his pen name , Minerva , Mr. Park also unleashed scathing attacks on the government ’s response to the global financial crisis .
Some of his postings contained factual errors .
The government accused him of undermining the financial markets .

This design , which was etched on a plaque attached to each of the two Pioneer spacecraft , was considered pornographic by some ( Illustration : NASA )
Click here to see images sent into space on NASA ’s twin Voyager probes
For nearly 50 years , the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) has scanned the heavens with radio telescopes for signs of alien technology .
At the same time , scientists have painstakingly crafted messages to send in reply .
When NASA launched its Voyager missions in 1977 , for example , both spacecraft carried audio recordings depicting the diversity of life and culture on Earth ( see gallery ) .
But never have those messages truly represented all of humanity .
On 15 May that will change as the SETI Institute launches a project to collect messages from people around the world .
Though there are currently no plans to transmit these messages into space , the project aims to foster a global discussion about whether we should send more than symbolic messages to the stars , and if so , what we should say .
The standard wisdom in interstellar diplomacy is to avoid controversy – a sometimes elusive goal .
In the early 1970s , NASA attached plaques to two Pioneer spacecraft etched with basic mathematics , science and line drawings of a man and woman ( see image at right ) .
Some complained the space agency was sending “ smut into space ” , with the naked figures revealing more than they deemed proper for a first encounter .

Other messages have escaped such criticism .
One from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico depicts the human form in so few pixels that its sex is not clear .
The Voyager recordings excluded war , poverty and disease .
However , a comprehensive message to the stars should not shrink from the details .
Might not an advanced extraterrestrial species , savvy in the ways of intelligent being , notice that something was missing from our description of ourselves ?
An acknowledgment of our flaws and frailties seems a more honest approach than sending a sanitised , one - sided story .
Honesty is a good starting point for a conversation that could last for generations .
If we continue to dodge controversy , we risk sending messages that are both brief and boring .
We sometimes clash in our beliefs and customs ; we disagree over matters of taste and morality .
In no small part this diversity of perspectives is what characterises us as a species .
And it may just make us intriguing enough to the inhabitants of other worlds to elicit a reply .

This release is available in French .
An NSERC - funded lab at the University Of Waterloo has laid the groundwork for a lithium battery that can store and deliver more than three times the power of conventional lithium ion batteries .
The research team of professor Linda Nazar , graduate student David Xiulei Ji and postdoctoral fellow Kyu Tae Lee are one of the first to demonstrate robust electrochemical performance for a lithium - sulphur battery .
The finding is reported today in the on - line issue of Nature Materials .
The prospect of lithium - sulphur batteries has tantalized chemists for two decades , and not just because successfully combining the two chemistries delivers much higher energy densities .
Sulphur is cheaper than many other materials currently used in lithium batteries .
It has always showed great promise as the ideal partner for a safe , low cost , long lasting rechargeable battery , exactly the kind of battery needed for energy storage and transportation in a low carbon emission energy economy .
" The difficult challenge was always the cathode , the part of the battery that stores and releases electrons in the charge and recharge cycles , " said Dr. Nazar .
" To enable a reversible electrochemical reaction at high current rates , the electrically - active sulphur needs to remain in the most intimate contact with a conductor , such as carbon . "
The Canadian research team leap - frogged the performance of other carbon - sulphur combinations by tackling the contact issue at the nanoscale level .
Although they say the same approach could be used with other materials , for their proof of concept study they chose a member of a highly structured and porous carbon family called mesoporous carbon .
At the nanoscale level , this type of carbon has a very uniform pore diameter and pore volume .
Using a nanocasting method , the team assembled a structure of 6.5 nanometre thick carbon rods separated by empty three to four nanometre wide channels .
Carbon microfibres spanning the empty channels kept the voids open and prevented collapse of the architecture .
Filling the tiny voids proved simple .
Sulphur was heated and melted .
Once in contact with the carbon , it was drawn or imbibed into the channels by capillary forces , where it solidified and shrunk to form sulphur nanofibres .
Scanning electron microscope sections revealed that all the spaces were uniformly filled with sulphur , exposing an enormous surface area of the active element to carbon and driving the exceptional test results of the new battery .
" This composite material can supply up to nearly 80 percent of the theoretical capacity of sulphur , which is three times the energy density of lithium transition metal oxide cathodes , at reasonable rates with good cycling stability , " said Dr. Nazar .
What is more , the researchers say , the high capacity of the carbon to incorporate active material opens the door for similar " imbibed " composites that could have applications in many areas of materials science .
The research team continues to study the material to work out remaining challenges and refine the cathode 's architecture and performance .
Dr. Nazar said a patent has been filed , and she is reviewing options for commercialization and practical applications .

Leaders of the world 's largest economies will shortly announce an agreement worth around $ 1.1 trillion to tackle the global financial crisis .
To help countries with severe problems , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) will get extra resources worth up to $ 750 bn ( £ 510bn ) .
In addition , there will be a deal at the G20 summit to " name and shame " countries that breach free - trade rules .
There will also be sanctions against secretive tax havens .
A member of the German delegation told the BBC 's reporter Joe Lynam that the G20 will pledge $ 1.1tn for multilateral organisations such as the IMF .
Key measures
An official announcement will be made soon , but leaders are expected to announce measures in the following key areas : SUMMIT SCHEDULE 0730 G20 leaders arrived at the Excel Centre , East London 0830 Summit began with working breakfast 1530 Closing statement by Brown ( this has been delayed ) 1745 Obama closing press conference All times BST
Read Robert Peston 's blog G20 summit in pictures :
Day two G20 ushers in historic IMF changes • IMF boost :
The resources of the International Monetary Fund , the emergency lender for countries in financial trouble , will be expanded by $ 750 bn .
Its coffers have been depleted in recent months by having to help a number of Eastern European nations
The G20 nations are expected to agree to lend it an extra $ 500 bn .
In addition , leaders will also agree significant changes that will in effect create an overdraft facility worth $ 250bn ( in the IMF 's currency , so - called Special Drawing Rights ) that the world 's poorest countries can call on •
Tax havens :
Treasury minister Stephen Timms says the G20 have agreed to impose sanctions on tax havens that refuse to sign up to OECD rules to fight money laundering and tax evasion , although discussions are continuing over whether unco-operative havens will be named and shamed • Global trade :
There will be about $ 250 bn committed to boost international trade , UK Chancellor Alistair Darling confirmed .
The figure will include national efforts already announced • Fiscal stimulus :
No new money will be pledged .
However , leaders are expected to pledge to do whatever it takes to boost their own economies and emphasise that - globally - $ 2 trillion is already being spent to tackle the global recession • Protectionism :
There will be a commitment to naming and shaming countries that breach free trade rules • Financial regulation :
Tighter limits on the financial system are expected , including the activities of hedge funds , which are currently unregulated investment funds •
Bankers :
There may also be measures to clamp down on bankers ' pay .
According to the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins , the agreement will mark a very substantial shift towards control and regulation of capitalism .
It does imply that business will be done in a very significantly different way in the future , he says .
Disagreements Earlier , UK Business Secretary Lord Mandelson told the BBC that despite all the preparatory work before the summit , there were still some issues to iron out .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" [ Disagreements ] persisted overnight , " Lord Mandelson told the BBC News channel , particularly over levels of funding for the IMF , regulation of tax havens and measures to boost global trade .
It is understood that Gordon Brown wants to go further than some other leaders on these matters .
" Our Prime Minister is excessively ambitious in what he wants out of this summit , " UK Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said .
" A good thing too , because there 's absolutely no point in people just coming here and rehearsing old arguments restating old commitments . "
Leaders started the crucial day of talks with a working breakfast , and before beginning what one minister described as " lively discussions " , posed for a team photo .
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper missed it when he was pulled aside by an aide .
When the photo was re-taken , however , the Italian Prime Minister , Silvio Berlusconi , was absent .
Protests Protesters gathered outside the summit , but in smaller numbers than Wednesday 's demonstrations in London 's financial district where one man died and 86 people were arrested .
By mid-afternoon on Thursday , that total had risen to 111 , the Metropolitan police said .
Several hundred staged " noisy but calm " protests near the Excel centre representing groups including the Stop the War Coalition and CND , the BBC's Ben Brown said .
A small group of protesters gathered earlier at the London Stock Exchange , but have since dispersed .
Further protests at G20 summit ' Balancing act ' Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The final agreement will not be the end of the process , BBC chief economics correspondent Hugh Pym warns .
" The G20 will need to meet again . "
He says the leaders will have a difficult balancing act in presenting the final agreements later on Thursday .
There will have to be a bit of pragmatism over what can and cannot be achieved , our correspondent says , but they must also convey a sense that they really have a vision as to how they can bring economies through this recession .
The recession has worsened since G20 leaders met last November in Washington .
Both the IMF and the World Bank expect the world economy to shrink for the first time in decades this year .
Reporting from from the Excel centre , BBC business correspondent John Moylan said the summit would be judged a success if the global recession became a short , sharp shock , rather than a very long downturn .
The G20 group of nations is made up of the world 's most powerful economies , accounting for 90 % of the world 's economic output , 80 % of world trade and two - thirds of the world 's population .

Award - winning website from the Center for Responsive Politics now provides 20 years of downloadable money - in - politics data–for free
WASHINGTON — Politicians , prepare yourselves .
Lobbyists , look out .
Today the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics is putting 200 million data records from the watchdog group ’s archive directly into the hands of citizens , activists , journalists and anyone else interested in following the money in U.S. politics .
For the first time in CRP ’s 26 - year history , the nonprofit research group ’s most popular data archives are fully and freely downloadable for non-commercial purposes from the Center ’s website , OpenSecrets.org–a four - time Webby winner for best politics site online .
OpenSecrets.org will remain the go - to independent source for most users interested in tracking money ’s political influence and , in fact , the site has some new general - interest features as of today .
( More on those below . )
With today ’s announcement , skilled data - divers can explore the information that ’s already aggregated on OpenSecrets.org to its full depth .
Web developers and database experts can grab federal money - in - politics data that CRP ’s researchers have standardized and coded , and mash it up with other data sets .
Timelines , charts , maps , other graphics and mobile applications are just some of the projects that could result–all powered by CRP ’s unparalleled data .
“ Putting our data into more hands will put more eyes on Washington and , we hope , engage more Americans in their government , ” CRP Executive Director Sheila Krumholz said .
“ We hope that more people counting cash will lead to more people making change . ”
The OpenSecrets OpenData initiative is being generously underwritten by a three - year $ 1.2 million grant from Sunlight Foundation , which supports uses of the Internet to promote greater transparency of government and the interplay in Washington between money and public policy .
“ Building on its outstanding and long - earned reputation for accuracy and integrity , CRP is giving the public the keys to take government transparency to the next level , ” said Ellen Miller , Sunlight Foundation ’s executive director and co-founder .
“ This will have a long - term impact , undoubtedly inspiring many effective and creative uses of the data by civic hackers , journalists and bloggers . ”

More than 300 members of Congress are also linked to a political action committee , ostensibly to raise money to support other members of their party .
“ Campaign committees and leadership PACs are two of the deepest pockets in a politician ’s coat , ” Krumholz said , “ so it ’s important to watch them together to see who ’s potentially building the most influence with a lawmaker . ”
OpenSecrets.org ’s enhanced profiles for members of Congress also now allow users to download deeper tables of data - aggregated data and “ top ” rankings , but not individual records , in a variety of formats with one easy click .
This feature will be integrated into other sections of OpenSecrets.org in the future .
Krumholz said , “ All these enhancements to OpenSecrets.org are about one thing : showing more people how money ’s influence on politics affects their lives–and empowering them to do something about it . ”

How To Avoid Internet Scams
Do some research on the company you are thinking about dealing with .
Find out if they are going to employ you themselves or if they just want to sell you training materials .
Do not think that you can make easy money .
Working at home is just like running a business anywhere else .
You will have to work hard and be patient to see results .
You will also need to be skilled and offer good products or services .
Be wary of unsolicited emails offering work at home jobs .
Many of these emails are scams .
Learn all of the details before you pay for anything .
A real company will be glad to give you all of the information that you need such as what you will be doing and who you will be working for .
Discover if there is a market for your type of work .
You have to be careful about companies that say that they already have customers lined up for you in fields like craft design or medical billing .
You will want to contact the so called customers to see if they are real .
Check out your state 's legal requirements .
You may need a license for work like medical billing .
Take your time and make sure that you have all of the qualifications that are needed for the type of work that you are interested in trying from home .
Learn their refund policy .
If you buy supplies from them , then find out if you can return them for return within some days .
Be careful about the envelope stuffing scam .
You do not really get materials to work for the company .
You instead get told to place an ad like the one that you answered , asking people to send you money for information about working from home .
This is a pyramid scheme and you could get charged with fraud , since you are not offering a real service or product .
Watch out for companies that are offering to send you a pay advance .
Some scam artist know how to use these cyber scams to build trust and get your money .
They send you a check , and then you deposit it into your bank account .
The crook then tells you that you were overpaid or something similar .
You return the money that you think you owe them , and then you find out the check you deposited has actually bounced .
Now the scam artist has your payment and you owe your bank money .
Study all of the work at home jobs that you find very carefully .
Take your time and choose the ones that you know are legitimate .
Look online for a ripoff report or reviews of the company that you are considering .
You might discover that some of these companies hire locally , so there may not be that many job locations in your area .
Do not give up though .
Keep looking for a work at home job that suits your wants and needs .

On this article you can read the pros and cons of the most manipulated work at home jobs scams and legit programs .
John Schnatter , founder of the pizza chain Papa John's , recently made a statement on BBC 's popular Radio Four program that would have been a tremendous example of social responsibility from a corporate leader .
Instead , careless journalism made his comments seem less like responsible behavior and more like poor business strategy during a time of economic turmoil .
In response to BBC presenter Adam Shaw 's question regarding the UK government 's £ 275 m anti-obesity drive and whether it would effect the prosperity of his business in the EU , Schnatter replied : " No . Pizza 's actually healthy for you if you do n't eat too much of it .
You can't eat five or six slices but if you eat one or two slices it 's very nutritious . "
Shaw jokingly replied , " I 'm not sure your investors would want to hear you tell people do n't eat too much of our pizzas , " and ended the interview with a laugh .
This exchange between Schnatter and Shaw became a major story , earning a top spot in the " Latest News " column on CNN 's homepage amongst the daily panic - inducing headlines about massive job cuts and bankruptcies .
As it is highly unusual for a company 's founder to advise the public to consume less of his own company 's product , Schnatter 's statement was newsworthy , economic crisis or not .
But , given the current global panic , was it necessary for Shaw to draw attention to Schnatter 's comment in this way ?
Journalistically , was it really " benefiting the public ' good " in this frantic climate , to bring negativity to some common sense that was only intended to help the world 's pizza - eating population ?
Absolutely not .
Publicly held Papa John 's ( NASDAQ : PZZA.O ) is the world 's third largest international pizza chain and was recently ranked the number 10 global franchise for 2009 in Entrepreneur magazine 's Franchise 500 .
In an environment where chain stores are shutting down at hundreds of locations , Papa John 's has experienced relative stability and recently added to its 3000 locations by opening it's doors in the Dominican Republic and adding a hundred new restaurants in Malaysia .
What 's more , the Schnatter interview had plenty of potential for positive PR .
In a broad sense , Schnatter 's comments should have underscored progress toward a notion of social responsibility .
His message of caution could have been posed as a hope - inspiring example of a fast - food executive putting his customers ' health over money - making potential by recommending to eat in moderation .
Moreover , it could have been a step in the right direction toward a top - down approach to healthier living , helping to raise awareness of the growing obesity epidemic .
Or it could even have been a simple example of an American businessman going abroad and helping to disprove the unfortunate stereotypes surrounding American consumerism and gluttony .
Instead , this story seemed to join the daily doom and gloom of economic news all because John Schnatter essentially said , " Look , pizza tastes awesome , but if we eat six slices at a time we may turn into the amorphous race of people from Wall - E . "
In fairness , Shaw 's words were said jokingly as he ended the interview and most likely were not made with an ulterior motive in mind .
But he should have realized that , given the times , his offhand comment was careless at best and sensational at worst .
If he needed some sort of filler talk to close the discussion he could have shed a positive light on Schnatter 's advice by saying something along the lines of , " It 's not every day you hear a company founder caring about its consumers enough to say consume less . "
There was simply no need to make already nervous investors wary of a successful and financially sound company during a global economic crisis .
The MSM is constantly blasting executives these days for fiscal irresponsibility , and often correctly , but the one time a corporate bigwig makes a socially responsible comment , insensitive news reporting presents him in a negative way .
If the world is expected to realize " era of social responsibility " as part of economic recovery , it will require more sensitive and responsible journalists , not just corporate leaders .

This article examines the biographical evidence for a plausible connection between the philosopher Pythagoras and Sparta .
It takes into consideration the sources that we have on the subject as well as their probable motivations .
A variety of sources are employed to this end and they range from philosophical treatises to archaeological artefacts .
It also considers other potential reasons as to why Pythagoras or Pythagorean philosophers might be interested in Sparta .
These include , but are not limited to , issues of Spartan social organisation , ( near ) sexual equality and music .
Article
Pythagoras is a figure who is shrouded in obscurity and whose life is typically retold in mythic terms .
Burkert begins his treatise on this enigmatic philosopher writing that ‘ Over the origins of Greek philosophy and science lies the shadow of a great traditional name ’ , [ 1 ] that is : Pythagoras of Samos ( c. 569 - c. 475 BCE ) .
Significantly , his very name means something like ‘ mouthpiece of Delphi ’ .
[ 2 ]
This fact by itself would have aroused the interest of the Spartans ( who were very keen on the Oracle at Delphi , even fighting a series of ‘ sacred wars ’ over the control of it ) and , so the accounts tell us , this interest was reciprocated .
Accounts report that Pythagoras made one or more visits there and to Krete in order to study their laws before journeying to southern Italy , where he settled in Kroton around 530 BCE , and later in the Lakonian colony of Taras . [ 3 ]
Did he really go to all of these places in person or did the Pythagorean movement make such claims in order to bolster their own credibility ?
Did others make similar claims for political and / or propagandistic reasons ?
Let us consider the sources as we have them .
The most detailed accounts of Pythagoras ’ life date from the third century CE , some 800 years after his death .
Diogenes Laertius ( c. 200-250 CE ) and Porphyry ( c. 234-305 CE ) each wrote a Life of Pythagoras .
Iamblichus ’ ( c. 245-325 CE ) work is titled
On the Pythagorean Life , which includes some limited biography but focuses more on the way of life supposedly established by Pythagoras for his followers .
All of these works were written at a time when Pythagoras ’ achievements appear to have been heavily revised in order to serve various ideological ends .
Diogenes is potentially the more objective , but both Iamblichus and Porphyry had agendas that were not particularly concerned with historical accuracy .
Iamblichus [ 4 ] reported that Pythagoras had political dealings in Sicily , Lampaskos and Kroton ( to name a few such places ) , and appears to have held a particular interest in the constitutional formulations of Krete and Sparta .
[ 5 ]
Sparta did enjoy cultural ties with Samos in Classical and pre-Classical antiquity ; but , this alone does not prove that Pythagoras actually went there .
[ 6 ]
It does perhaps enhance the credibility of the claim , if only in a minor sense .
Even so , one would not be remiss in questioning Iamblichus ’ intentions , with a programme of his own and so far removed from Pythagoras ’ own time .
Who were his sources and are they reliable ?
Iamblichus has left us relatively little by way of a bibliography . [ 7 ]
Some are known and others may be deduced .
Iamblichus describes Pythagoras as a soul sent from the gods to enlighten humanity and then proceeds to embed Neopythagorean values in his narrative on Pythagoras ’ reputed ideas .
[ 8 ]
In effect , his goal was to produce the Neopythagoreanization of Neoplatonism .
Iamblichus strove to get across the view that Pythagoras was particularly concerned with the mystical qualities of mathematics , a key feature of Neopythagoreanism .
It is not an accurate account of the original Pythagoreanism based on the earliest evidence .
Porphyry , with a comparable agenda , also emphasized Pythagoras ’ divine aspects and may have intended to use this image of him as a rival for that of Jesus . [ 9 ]
Apart from their historical revisions and ideological emplacements , these third - century CE accounts were based on earlier sources which are now lost .
Some were clearly contaminated by the Neopythagorean view of Pythagoras as the source of all true philosophy .
They maintained that his ideas were plaigiarised by Plato , Aristotle and all later Greek philosophers .
Iamblichus cites both Nicomachus of Gerasa ’s and Apollonius of Tyana ’s biographies of Pythagoras and appears to have used them extensively even where they are not cited .
[ 10 ] Nicomachus ( c. 50 - c. 150 CE ) gives Pythagoras a patently Platonic and Aristotelian metaphysics in distinctively Platonic and Aristotelian terminology . [ 11 ]
Apollonius ( first century CE ) venerated Pythagoras as the model for his own ascetic life , perhaps idolising him beyond all objectivity .
Porphyry explicitly cites Moderatus of Gades as one of his sources . [ 12 ]
Moderatus also had an agenda .
He was a particularly zealous Neopythagorean of the first century CE , who asserted that Plato , Aristotle , and their pupils Speusippus , Aristoxenos and Xenocrates took for their own the fruits of Pythagoreanism , re-writing history so as to leave only superficial and trivial aspects to be associated with the original Pythagorean school . [ 13 ]
The difficulty of fully trusting such claims from these sources is clear .
Diogenes Laertius himself ( third century CE ) possibly had less personal motivation for revising the Pythagorean history .
However , he has based much of his account of Pythagoras ’ philosophy on the Pythagorean Memoirs excerpted from Alexander Polyhistor . [ 14 ]
These are regarded as a forgery dating from around 200 BCE , which attributes certain essential ideas of the Platonic and Stoic schools to Pythagoras . [ 15 ]
Diogenes Laertius was not dependant on Alexander alone .
In the biographical section of his Life of Pythagoras , he is drawing on the chronologies of the Alexandrian scholars Eratosthenes ( c. 276-194 BCE ) and Apollodorus ( c. 180 BCE ) amongst others .
Eratosthenes of Cyrene was the third librarian of Alexandria and measured the circumference of the earth with greater accuracy than Aristotle .
He is credited with having invented a scientific chronology that was carried on by Apollodorus .
One of the surviving fragments of Eratosthenes ’ chronology potentially connects Pythagoras with Sparta via an alleged Olympic victory and may be read alongside the iconography of a Spartan wall relief from the fourth century BCE , to which this article shall presently return . [ 16 ]
In Diogenes ’ Life of Pythagoras , he makes no direct mention of the latter going to Sparta at all and only alludes in passing references to the time that he spent on Krete . [ 17 ]
He mentions a book by Pythagoras on politics which was supposedly concerned with the inner workings of the Pythagorean society . [ 18 ]
Even Diogenes acknowledges that there is contention as to whether or not this Politikon actually existed .
The fact that there is a tradition that it did exist and was supposedly based on ideas for communal living picked up during his time at Krete and Sparta ( along with the fashion for long hair ) resonates with the Neo - Pythagorean agendas mentioned above .
The perception that such a book existed and paid tribute to Spartan customs was perhaps more significant than the book itself .
Diogenes reports that Pythagoras made a bloodless sacrifice to the altar of Apollo at Delos which , as we shall see , does relate to the Spartans if indirectly . [ 19 ]
However , he alludes to a potentially more significant Spartan connection in the Life of Pherekydes of Syros ( born c. 600/597 , acme c. 544 ) , [ 20 ] who was reputedly an immediate teacher of Pythagoras .
He writes :
…he is said to have told the Lakedaimonians to honour neither gold nor silver , as Theopompus says in his Marvels ; and it is reported that Herakles laid this injunction on him in a dream , and that the same night he appeared also to the kings of Sparta , and enjoined them to be guided by Pherekydes ; but some attribute these stories to Pythagoras . [ 21 ]
A tangible link between Sparta and Pherekydes is implied here , even if fictional , and , by extension , with Pythagoras as well .
Interestingly , Diogenes Laertius suggests that there is a tradition which claims Pythagoras himself was actively involved in Spartan politics , rather than just studying them , but he does not tell us whom the ominous ‘ some ’ that say so happen to be .
Certainly it is plausible that Pythagoras might have followed in the footsteps of his teacher , if Pherekydes was in fact his teacher . [ 22 ]
It is possible to correlate some of the material on Pherekydes with recourse to Diogenes ’ source , Theopompus of Chios ( c. 380 BCE ) . [ 23 ]
Theopompos ’ father was a member of the pro-Spartan faction on Chios .
Like Xenophon , he was a Lakonophile and a supporter of Aristocracy .
Nothing of his original Marvels remains , if it ever existed as a single text , but there are surviving fragments from his voluminous Phillipika ( of which book VIII is sometimes referred to as On Marvels ) .
This is meant to be a history of Macedonia but engages in a series of digressions on numerous historical and ethnographic subjects .
In it he mentions the prophetic powers of Pherekydes and makes some derogatory statements about Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism , accusing that they taught and encouraged tyranny in the governance of city - states . [ 24 ]
In another passage from Diogenes Laertius , just prior to that cited above and likewise attributed to Theopompus , Pherekydes is said to have forewarned his host in Messene to emigrate just prior to that city ’s conquest and enslavement by the Spartans in the Second Messenian War .
This seems to be some inspired mythologising on his ‘ prophetic powers ’ and it also raises the question as to how he could have known so much about Spartan foreign policy .
The same account also indicates that Pherekydes was involved in the wars between Ephesos and Magnesia / Sparta and that he revealed similarly mantic powers there .
But both of these can be dismissed for chronological reasons .
The latter are alluded to by the seventh - century poets Kallinos and Archilochos and , as Schibli indicates , ‘ like the Second Messenian War , the conflicts between Ephesos and Magnesia predate Pherekydes ’ . [ 25 ]
It was apparently pleasing to some that Pherekydes , and maybe Pythagoras as well , should be seen as having been involved in several of the more celebrated moments of Spartan history and notably from its ‘ glory days ’ prior to Leuktra .
When Diogenes Laertius mentioned that ‘ some ’ have alleged that Pherekydes ’ prophetic powers actually belonged to Pythagoras , he is probably referring to the fourth - century BCE author Andron of Ephesos as well as to Porphyry ( 232-305 CE ) , the anti-Christian follower of the Neo - Platonist philosopher Plotinus ( 205-270 CE ) .
Porphyry maintained the same view as that of Andron of Ephesus to the effect that these purportedly mantic qualities should be properly attributed to Pythagoras .
He also blamed Theopompus for plagiarising the stories of Andron , changing the names and locations in what he concluded to have been a rather pathetic attempt to hide his theft . [ 26 ]
However , Porphyry seems to have misplaced his blame since Andron ’s version of Pythagoras ’ life appears to have been largely a fabrication . [ 27 ]
If this is the case , then it does not necessarily lend any greater degree of verisimilitude to Theopompus ’ account of Pherekydes ’ life .
The former evidently agreed with sources that made the latter Pythagoras ’ teacher but seems to have thought little of Pythagoras as an individual , for whatever reasons of his own .
His attribution of prophetic powers , often associated in other sources with Pythagoras , to Pherekydes , suggests a potential dislike for the former that is underscored by the above mentioned reference to Pythagoreanism as teaching tyranny . [ 28 ]
Since Theopompus ’ agenda is clearly the defamation of this school and its founder , his version of events must also be suspect .
It is reasonable to consider that these mystical attributes , originally Pherekydes ’ , became later associated with Pythagoras on account of the inclinations of ancient biographers to embellish their tales of famous individuals with mythical attributes .
Andron ’s fabrication , possibly based on an earlier or contemporaneous life of Pherekydes ( potentially one of Theopompus ’ sources ) , no doubt encouraged it .
Unless , of course , Theopompus was actually using Andron , or Andron ’s source , as one of his sources and chose to associate the said qualities with Pherekydes on account of his personal disapproval for Pythagoras .
The second - century BCE writer Apollonius seamlessly smoothes over this tricky issue by indicating that , later in his life , Pythagoras did not refrain from the same sort of ‘ miracle working ’ as that undertaken by his teacher . [ 29 ]
Pherekydes composed a prose text ( called variously Heptamychos , Theokrasia or Theoginia ) that is no longer extant . [ 30 ]
Based on the fragments that survive , it was a philosophical treatise mostly on divine matters , morality and social customs .
He taught through the medium of mythic representations .
Aristotle characterised his method as a mixture of myth and philosophy .
Pherekydes is sometimes considered the first philosopher to declare the immortality of the soul . [ 31 ]
This would seem to connect with Pythagoreanism if it is the case that the early Pythagoreans also maintained the same belief , which is debatable .
It remains contested as to whether this was the case or the desire of later scholars to reconcile philosophical traditions .
Sources that might have offered greater evidence that Pherekydes was the immediate teacher of Pythagoras are in disagreement even about occasions when the two could have met . [ 32 ]
One that does maintain the student / teacher relationship between them is Ion of Chios ( c. 490 - 421 BCE ) , the dramatist - polymath - philosopher cum lyric poet who was a friend of Sokrates and a dramatic rival of Euripides .
An epigram of his survives in Diogenes Laertius implying a connection with Pythagoras :
Ion of Chios says this about him [ sc. Pherekydes ] :
Thus adorned with courageous pride and reverence , he has a pleasant life for his soul though he be dead , if indeed Pythagoras was truly wise , who beyond all knew and searched out the thoughts of men . [ 33 ]
Another survives in Diogenes Laertius from Douris the tyrant and Samos ( fourth century BCE ) , who was also a philosopher and historian :
Douris says in the second book of his Horai that the following epigram was written about him [ sc. Pherekydes ] :
The end of all wisdom is in me ; if there is anything more [ of wisdom ] , tell my Pythagoras that he is the first of all throughout the land of Hellas .
In saying this , I do not lie . [ 34 ]
We should probably remain as sceptical of these literary connections as much as the association between Pherekydes and Pythagoras implicit in the doxographers . [ 35 ]
The two men may never have met .
The latter may have refined the doctrine on the immortality of the soul from the former ’s treatise on the subject without actual contact with its author .
There is nonetheless the tantalising suggestion of a possible connection between these two men as teacher and student .
If correct , then there is some indication , often ignored in the mainstream scholarship on this subject , that Pythagoras also may have been inspired to some extent for his own theory of reincarnation by that of his alleged teacher . [ 36 ]
There are a number of other sources that maintain Pherekydes also professed and taught metempsychosis . [ 37 ]
This is not verifiable . [ 38 ]
The origin of this notion is variously attributed to Pherekydes as well as to Thales . [ 39 ]
However , there is a tendency in ancient scholarship ( especially in Diogenes Laertius ) to despise a vacuum left by the textual sources and to fill it by attributing ‘ the origin of ’ this or that doctrine to a particular individual who may have happened to espouse it when no one else can be found previously who held the same beliefs .
[ 40 ]
Pherekydes ’ and Pythagoras ’ relationship still remains to be proven as does their alleged association with the Spartans .
The proposition that Pherekydes made pronouncements on Spartan legal matters with recourse to divine authority , as indicated by Diogenes Laertius ( via Theopompus ) , is not prima facie unreasonable .
The approximate dates of his life , as with Pythagoras , do potentially match those indicated by the archaeological evidence for Sparta ’s adoption of their characteristic monetary policies , if interpreted with a modicum of liberality . [ 41 ]
However , as Flower indicates , ‘ Theopompus seems to have been alone in attributing this warning to Pherecydes ’ . [ 42 ]
Aristotle , Diodorus and Plutarch all agreed that the prophecy against the use of money was given by the Oracle at Delphi , indicating : ‘ the love of money and nothing else shall destroy Sparta ’ . [ 43 ]
All but Aristotle , and even he to some extent , are heavily dependent on Xenophon who was not unbiased in his reports on Sparta and neither , as we have seen , were the Spartans themselves . [ 44 ]
Did Pherekydes go to Sparta setting a precedent for his student ?
He is described as being well - travelled , much as with Pythagoras and others .
However , as Schibli writes , ‘ whether Pherekydes actually journeyed … to the Peloponnese , Delphi , and Ephesos , simply cannot be verified from the biographical legends ’ . [ 45 ]
The tradition of ancient wise men travelling extensively is well documented in later antiquity , almost to the point of being a literary cliché , except that some of them really did travel far in their pursuit of wisdom . [ 46 ]
Over Pherekydes ’ life and reported journeys hangs doubt and uncertainty as well as whether he may have been Pythagoras ’ teacher and that he may have either had an interest in Sparta and / or went there .
Certainly from Plato ’s era onwards there was a perceived association between Pythagoras and Sparta . [ 47 ]
There are other factors that might yet shed some light on this alleged association .
After the Pythagorean supported oligarchy at Kroton was overthrown around 450 BCE , Taras ( Tarentum ) became the centre of Pythagoreanism . [ 48 ]
Sparta ’s only colonial holding outside of Arcadia , Taras was founded around 706 in the wake of the Messenian conflicts and may have come about as a consequence of exacerbated social unrest resulting from those conflicts . [ 49 ]
This is where Plato ’s friend Archytas was situated and where the former was known to have visited and associated with several Pythagoreans in his own era . [ 50 ]
It is plausible to suggest that they had already established a foothold there before the civil strife in Kroton .
‘ It is a question , however ’ , as Burkert writes , ‘ what Pythagoras had to do with these events ’ . [ 51 ]
The dates do not quite square , although a liberal interpretation might compel them to do so .
There is also a tendency in the literature to refer to the Pythagoreans of this era as ‘ Pythagoras ’ in the singular . [ 52 ]
Whatever their loyalties to the kings and customs of Sparta , the colonial government of Taras was also more amenable to commerce in coinage .
This resulted in a migration of skilled labour from Lakonia to Taras in the sixth century when Sparta introduced its more rigid reforms . [ 53 ]
By the end of the Peloponnesian Wars , Sparta was ‘ undoubtedly a non-monetary economy ’ , but the possession of precious metals seems to have occurred even if officially decried . [ 54 ]
Taras ’ difference in this respect provides further evidence to suggest that it was unlikely that Pythagoras advised the Spartans to avoid coinage ( perhaps it really was Pherekydes ) , since he and his followers were so closely associated with a Spartan colony that embraced money and trade with something of a zeal .
The same can be said of Kroton which , when under Pythagorean direction , became the dominant and wealthiest city in the region . [ 55 ]
There is one piece of hard evidence that may support some of the literary sources in terms of a real Pythagorean connection with Lakonia , to a point .
A Spartan wall relief , dated to the late fourth century BCE , depicts Pythagoras engaged in some kind of musical dialogue with Orpheus . [ 56 ]
The latter is seated with a lyre and Pythagoras seems to be handing him a scroll ; or , potentially , he has just received it from him .
There are various animals in the background but over Pythagoras ’ head is an eagle which imparts to his character a mystical significance , being a symbol of Zeus and Apollo , and is both a reference to his reputed victory at Olympia along with his alleged abilities as a diviner of auguries based on the flights of birds . [ 57 ]
The association with Orpheus in the wall relief should be considered in the light of evidence that Orphism originated with the Pythagorean movement and the Orphic texts themselves may have actually been composed by Pythagoras . [ 58 ]
The image is clearly replete with mythic and shamanistic symbolism .
However , one is inclined to wonder whether it is merely a case of Spartan spin .
A variation of the Lakonian type of communism appears to have worked well on the small scale amongst the Pythagorean communities .
They were bound together by their intimacy along with what might be termed ‘ ritual practices ’ that reinforced their mutual identity . [ 59 ]
They gathered in the homakoeion , a place for ‘ hearing together ’ and received their akousma ( hearing ) and symbolon ( password ) .
‘ We are told ’ , as Kahn indicates , ‘ of a five - year trial period during which initiates , who had put their property in common , were to listen in silence to the voice of Pythagoras ’ who was concealed behind a linen curtain . [ 60 ]
They were tested in some way and , if successful , they became ‘ esoterics ’ and were allowed to meet and converse with the master .
If they failed , they were supposedly given back double their surety but were then treated ‘ as dead ’ by the other initiates . [ 61 ]
However , all of our sources on this come from late antiquity and the term homakoeion is only found in Imperial era sources .
Sexual equality ( or near - equality ) of the sort later imagined by Plato was allegedly a feature of the first Pythagorean community . [ 62 ]
A significant number of women were purportedly involved in the homakoeion , including Pythagoras ’ own wife and daughter who were both famous for their wisdom , according to Porphyry . [ 63 ]
Iamblichus mentions several Spartans , some of whom were women , who were Pythagoreans . [ 64 ]
Of his original following of 235 , seventeen are asserted to have been women .
Five of these were Spartans and two were from Taras ( only three Spartan men are named ) . [ 65 ]
Many of the original Pythagoreans were colonial Spartiates from Taras ; Kroton supplied much of the remainder .
Amongst the Spartan women were said to have been Kleaichma , the sister of Autocharidas , [ 66 ] along with Chilonis , the daughter of the sage Chilon . [ 67 ]
The tradition of Spartan women being educated comparably to Spartan men seems to be a factor in the purported Pythagorean choices . [ 68 ]
There may also be a double meaning to the assertion , mentioned above , that Pythagoras went there to study Lakedaimonian ‘ laws ’ .
The word nomos held multiple connotations and a fluid range of meanings for the ancient Greeks over time and dependent on context .
It may have originally signified ‘ assigned pastures ’ and ‘ appropriate dwelling places ’ but later came to mean something more like ‘ common usage ’ or ‘ custom ’ as well as ‘ law ’ . [ 69 ]
Nomos also denotes a ‘ tune ’ or ‘ melody ’ and this twist of meaning becomes a favourite source of puns in Plato ’s final opus , the Nomoi . [ 70 ]
The Aristotelian Problemata provides a ready summary of this play on words . [ 71 ]
The Pythagoreans were certainly interested in music .
They , along with Platonist and Aristotelian musical theorists , measured melody and rhythm mathematically and , thus , developed a fairly precise system of notation for both . [ 72 ]
Aristoxenos of Taras ( fourth century BCE ) , a student of Aristotle and later the Pythagorean philosophers Lamprus of Erythrae and Xenophilus , held that the notes of the scale are to be judged , not exclusively by mathematical ratios , but by the ear . [ 73 ]
This essential differentiation separates the science of acoustics from musical praxis – a distinction that is at the heart of modern musical theory .
Aristoxenos is credited with having initiated the nascence of musicology . [ 74 ]
Music also entailed ethical and metaphysical qualities in the minds of the ancients .
Different modes were thought to promote certain character types , behaviours and feelings .
This theory of musical influence was largely developed by the Pythagoreans . [ 75 ]
As West indicates , they ‘ are reported to have classified ( and made systematic practical use of ) types of music producing different effects , rousing or calming ’ . [ 76 ]
Some varieties of the Lydian style were seen as mournful , the Ionian relaxing and , more importantly here , the Dorian ( Spartan ) and Phrygian are considered to promote self - control and courage . [ 77 ]
Musical acumen was a pan-Hellenic phenomenon but one that found its home , for a time , in Sparta .
In terms of their poetical and artistic achievements , as with their mode of governance , they were extraordinary even prior to their later , martial reforms .
In the seventh century , Sparta was the most important musical centre of Greece . [ 78 ]
It could even be accurately described as an ancient ‘ centre of musical excellence ’ . [ 79 ]
This could have made Sparta an ideal place for a philosopher interested in musical theory .
The Spartans were geographically closest of the mainland Greeks to the Egyptians and perhaps the first to imitate their musical systems .
They appear to have replicated another Egyptian custom as well , namely that of artistic ossification .
In the fourth century , Plato wrote that the Spartans and Kretans , like the Egyptians , refused to allow innovation in their fixed canon of dances and songs . [ 80 ]
In fifth - century Sparta , as Marrou indicates , ‘ Tyrtaeus ’ elegies were still the most popular songs in the repertoire , but ’ , he adds , ‘ that was because of their moral tone and because they made good marching songs ’ . [ 81 ]
It was recognized that music could be designed to leave a powerful and specific impression on the listener . [ 82 ]
We are told that Pythagoras was very interested in music on both a technical and a philosophical level .
He was said to have rejected the practice of judging music by means of sensual perception alone , ‘ saying that its excellence was to be grasped by the mind ’ and so introduced a sophisticated system of measuring tonal quality utilising mathematics . [ 83 ]
This may have been one of the first scientific experiments .
Pythagoras is also credited with having invented the octave , in part , by adding an eighth string to the archaic 7 - string lyre at a mathematically determined interval . [ 84 ]
Music was also perceived by the Pythagoreans to have an association with metaphysical phenomena including metempsychosis and cosmology in general – ergo the doctrine of the Harmony of the Spheres . [ 85 ]
The Spartan construction of musical experience for social control also seems to have been a subject of interest to the Pythagoreans , even if it cannot be attributed directly to Pythagoras himself .
The magical powers ascribed to Orpheus , Pythagoras , and other pre-Sokratic sages ( even Sokrates ) were recognisably shamanic and this included the art of healing through music . [ 86 ]
Recall the Spartan wall relief mentioned above and its overtly Orphic connotations .
Pythagoras , Solon and Empedokles of Akragas all harnessed the artistic medium of poetry , for manifestly didactic ends , in order to convey their ideas and to persuade .
Their verses were accompanied by music and , as we have seen , with no small degree of calculation . [ 87 ]
There can be little doubt about the Pythagoreans themselves and their philosophical heirs , after Pythagoras ’ time , being interested in Sparta .
The sources on Pythagoras ’ life until Kroton leave much to be desired but , thereafter , there is somewhat more consistency if not always clarity .
There appear to have been Spartiates actively involved in the early Pythagorean movement .
It is again necessary to add the caveat that we may never know if that picture is accurate , and to what degree , or purely one that Iamblichus and others wanted us to receive .
There are other reasons as to why Pythagoras may have studied Sparta , as we have seen , and travelled there .
A possible link exists via his alleged teacher Pherekydes .
There is the case of Taras and its involvement with the Pythagoreans .
The number of Spartans and Tarentines affiliated directly with Pythagoreanism seems above average .
The Spartan communal system , their legal code and its ‘ divine ’ origins , their command of poetry and music , their views on the nature of the soul after death along with other cultural attributes all lend some credibility to the later reports that Pythagoras was active there but could easily be revisionist history .
The Spartans of the fifth and fourth centuries onwards might have desired to promote their Pythagorean connections for propagandistic reasons .
All that can be said with confidence is that the Pythagoreans and Neopythagoreans were interested in Sparta and did have actual contact with the region – and , that there was a concerted effort by the Spartans to advance their alleged association with the famous philosopher .
More may yet be discovered ; however , for now it is necessary to be content with a Pythagoras who is still more than otherwise shrouded in mystery .

Award - winning investigative reporter Seymour Hersh dropped another bombshell this week when he revealed that former Vice - President Dick Cheney had his own SS - style political assassination unit that reported directly to him .
Hersh told a University of Minnesota audience on Tuesday , “ After 9/11 , I have n’t written about this yet , but the Central Intelligence Agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities against people they thought to be enemies of the state .
Without any legal authority for it .
They have n’t been called on it yet . ”
Hersh then went on to describe how the Joint Special Operations Command was an executive assassination unit that carried out political `assassinations abroad . .
“ It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently , ” he explained .
“ They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office .
…
Congress has no oversight of it . ”
[ efoods ]
The revelation that Cheney had his own private assassination unit is not too far removed from Hitler ’s notorious SA ( Sturmabteilung ) , the much feared para- military wing of the Nazi party who were used to beat , torture and kill political opponents of the Nazi party in 1930 ’s Germany and the Waffen SS , who were later used in the war to carry out executions and war crimes .
The SA were later targeted by Hitler during the Night of the Long Knives , a brutal purge to eliminate political adversaries both inside and outside of the Nazi party .
Hundreds of people were executed in cold blood by the Gestapo and the SS .
Tellingly , German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extra-judicial killings to demonstrate their loyalty to Hitler .
The Waffen SS was deemed beyond prosecution despite it blatantly being involved in egregious and ongoing war crimes , as well as domestic assassinations .
The Joint Special Operations Command , Cheney ’s assassination unit , is also described as an area of ‘ extra - legal ’ operations .
“ It ’s an executive assassination ring essentially , and it ’s been going on and on and on , ” Hersh stated .
“ Under President Bush ’s authority , they ’ve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving .
That ’s been going on , in the name of all of us . ”
And it ’s still going on .
None of Obama ’s reversals of Bush executive orders say anything about abolishing the Joint Special Operations Command .
Indeed , the specialist unit is an integral part of Obama ’s vastly expanded bombing raids and other incursions in Pakistan .

Apple this week quietly announced plans to begin selling an aluminum 20 - inch iMac configuration to qualified educational institutions for just $ 899 , effectively closing the book on the white 17 - inch legacy model that had previously assumed a similar role .
Buyers authorized to make purchases for their educational institution can begin pre-ordering the new aluminum systems today for delivery in about a month .
Each $ 899 20 - inch iMac includes a 2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo , 1GB of memory , 160GB hard drive , 8 x double - layer SuperDrive , and a NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M graphics subsystem .
The new offering replaces a $ 899 version of Apple 's white 17 - inch iMac that the company had held over since 2006 in an effort to allow institutions hit hard by tax revenues declines to continue to factor Macs into their refined budgets .
Interestingly , the move comes less than a month after the Mac maker issued an eNews letter promoting updates to the legacy 17 - inch systems , suggesting something in the last three weeks prompted the company to upgrade the specialized $ 899 offering to the latest aluminum designs , which feature a display with a 3 - inch wider viewing area .
The news also means that the white iMac casing , introduced in August of 2004 as the enclosure for the then cutting - edge iMac G5 , has now officially been put to rest .
All iMacs , both education and consumer , now use the Aluminum design introduced alongside updated iMacs in August of 2007 .
Apple 's new iMac lineup for educational institutions .

The EPA has awarded the single largest grant in their history to New York State for wastewater infrastructure projects : $ 430 million .
The funding comes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , and will finance municipal and county governments and wastewater utilities for projects to protect ponds , lakes , and streams in New York communities .
“ EPA is committed to being part of the solution in this economic downturn .
By keeping the waterways clean and healthy , weâ€ ™re bringing new jobs and new opportunities to local communities .
Protecting human health and the environment is a great way to put people to work and stimulate our economy . ”
– EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provides for $ 4 billion dollars to be awarded to fund wastewater infrastructure projects across the country , creating thousands of jobs and protecting the health and environment of millions of U.S. citizens .
“ Water and wastewater infrastructure are economic engines for communities .
Without these services communities cannot attract businesses .
Drinking and wastewater systems generate jobs long after the projects are complete .
The Recovery Act will help transform and modernize our aging wastewater and drinking water infrastructure .
It will help communities construct new facilities and modernize existing systems to be more effective in providing wastewater treatment and safe drinking water . ”
– EPA
At least 20 % of the Recovery Act funds must to green projects , projects involving green infrastructure and those that improve energy or water efficiency .
New Yorkâ€™s program will also provide funding for communities that are facing financial hardships .
“ New York State is committed to innovative approaches to building environmentally sustainable and energy efficient wastewater treatment technologies .
This funding will help protect our environment and will support thousands of jobs across the State at a time when we need it most . ”
– NY Governor Paterson
The EPA grant money will be awarded to the NY State Dept. of Environmental Conservation and implemented by the NY State Environmental Facilities Corporation .
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will also fund a $ 2 billion program to improve drinking water systems nationwide .
It 's rare to need a break from a game after only fifteen minutes of play time , but that 's exactly what happened when I sat down to review MadWorld on the Nintendo Wii .
The game can be incredibly numbing — the blood and the f-bombs , the killing and the maiming , and the unrelenting negativity of the game do n't offer much in the way subtlety .
The game takes place in a black - and - white world , where red splashes of blood are the only color .
It can sometimes be hard to see what 's going on , but you 'll always know what to do : kill .
You play Jack , a swaggering killer who is sponsored by an unnamed company , represented in a voice over by a sinister character called XIII .
Your job is to kill people in the most entertaining ways possible , for the viewers of the show you 're participating in .
This little bit of metagaming gives the ideas behind MadWorld a crazy sort of logic .
You get points for your kills because your viewers are grading you .
Rending someone with your chainsaw is good for a few points , but why not shove a signpost through them , and then throw them into a bed of spikes ?
Each level is filled with weapons and environmental threats ; finding the best ways to slice and dice your way to big points is half the fun .
Title MadWorld Developer Platinum Games Publisher Sega Price $ 49.99 Platform Nintendo Wii
A few special interest groups — whose names I wo n't give publicity to by printing them here — are aghast at the very idea of MadWorld , claiming it hurts Nintendo 's family - friendly image .
That 's absurd , because gaming consoles should n't have " images " any more than DVD players , but the hyper-violence and dark humor of MadWorld does seem rather out of place on the Wii .
Luckily , the Wiimote and nunchuk are used very well , with a combination of slashes , movements , and button - presses controlling your attacks .
The controls may be hard to master initially , but soon enough you 'll be delivering some epically violent kills .
There are a number of surprises for fans who have been following the game since its announcement , none of which I 'll divulge .
Let 's just say that you wo n't just be killing people , and some of the bosses are massive in size and detail .
There is something so compelling about the heavy black lines and lack of color that brings these characters to life ; there is nothing out there right now that looks like MadWorld .
People complain about the Wii's graphical power , and it can be hard to go back to Nintendo 's console after you 're used to your PS3 and 360 , but this looks just as good as anything on the more powerful systems .
This game proves that artistic vision is perfectly capable of making up for hardware shortcomings .
MadWorld is n't purely a brawler , as each level is filled with minigames that test your skills .
You 'll be hitting baddies with a baseball bat at a giant dartboard , or throwing enemies into the path of a passing train .
You 'll be knocking your opponents into a giant aircraft engine , red and dripping with their entrails .
You do n't have to play these diversions if you do n't want to — each one is unlocked when you hit certain point milestones in each level — but you 're missing a good bit of humor and nihilistic joy if you pass them by .
Each one is introduced by the Black Baron , a charming pimp who speaks about his ladies in less than flattering terms , only to be killed in each minigame by a dominatrix , who then bows .
Do n't worry about the Baron though , he 'll be back for the next one .
Touches like this may not make sense , but all add to the flavor of the game .
The game is over in short order ; dedicated players can run through it in one or two sittings .
You can take on your friends in the minigames , and playing through the game at a higher difficulty level gives you reason to go back to the game .
You 'll likely miss things in your first play - through , giving you a reason to return .
Besides , you 'll miss the play - by - play announcers once you turn the game off .
Sprinkled with four letter words and profane anecdotes , you 'll want to make sure there are no kids in the room while playing .
One story you 'll hear while fighting a boss ?
Let 's just say it involves a torn scrotum and a part of the anatomy " unraveling like a ball of yarn . "
I frequently could n't believe what I was hearing or seeing , and there were more than a few jaw - dropping moments of violence or surprise while playing the game .
This was a tough game to grind for a review — you 'll do much better to play it in smaller chunks — but it 's a title that will stay with me for a long time .
Getting a game like this made at all , much less on the Wii , seems almost like a cosmic joke .
MadWorld looks and feels like something fresh and new , even if it appeals to our basest feelings .
This is the reason that Sega is such an inconsistent publisher : it 's lazy enough to release something as misguided as Sonic Unleashed , but brave enough to bring MadWorld to the Nintendo Wii .
Gaming is better for it , although you 'll likely be hearing about the game on the local news soon enough .

Many carry an image of BDSM that leads them to believe it is all about whips and spankings .
The portrayal of this lifestyle online concentrates on just a small portion of the lifestyle .
For those who live this way of life daily , there is so much more than just a scene .
Thus , the rewards are far greater than just sexual .
Today , I would like to focus upon the spiritual aspect of BDSM .
This might seem contrary at first glance .
However , anyone who has come across someone new will know the truth .
New people , when first joining this way of life , often get in touch with something very deep within them .
It is like they access the ' inner core ' of their being .
I feel this is a form of a spiritual experience .
To be fair , I will tell you I am not going to go all " woo woo " on you .
This is not an esoteric blog focusing on spiritual disciplines .
Nevertheless , studies show that in the United States over 90 % of the people believe in God .
Worldwide , billions of people have different particular faiths they practice .
Regardless of the belief , BDSM helps us get into that flow .
Paul Lowe , the self help teacher , talks about how ' most of our neuroses are tied to our sexuality ' .
The majority of the population is hung up about their own sexuality .
It is no wonder they look at those of us in BDSM with distain .
They have bought into the sexual ideals that others chose for them .
Lowe goes on to explain that ' once we are totally comfortable with our sexuality , that is when our neuroses disappear and we start connecting properly with our spiritual flow ' .
I know this sounds a bit hocky until you sit and ponder it a while .
Many people who find this lifestyle often get the feeling ' of being home ' .
It is something they searched for over the years .
It is only after discovering this way of life that their life seemed contented .
I believe this is where people are getting in touch with that ' thing that is bigger than them ' .
We are all created from something .
The allure of BDSM is the freeing of ourselves from socially defined norms .
This is not done in a rebellious manner .
Rather , it is an individual finding what works for them .
Being true to oneself is the hardest thing to do with all the influences that exist in the world .
Those who connect with the BDSM way of life have found a spiritual connection .
Obviously this can occur on many different levels .
The point I am making is that there is so much deeper than just whips and cuffs .
Those taking the time can realize a much bigger purpose to their sexual / relationship choices .
BDSM is all of that .
Disturbed not just by the reports of crime in Wallingford , but by the police department ’s seeming indifference to it ( Car Prowl , Block Watch ? ) , Wallyhood took it on the road yesterday and paid a visit to Capt .
Mike Washburn of the Seattle Police Department North Precinct and his second - in - command , Lt. Robin Clark .
As a bit of background , Seattle ’s North Precinct stretches from the Ship Canal to the Seattle City Limit at 145th St N and water - to - water , Ballard to Sand Point , and it ’s the single largest precinct in the state , as large as the entire Tacoma police department .
There are , we learned , about 230 personnel charged with serving and protecting that area , and they ’ve divvied it up into five sectors : Boy , John , Lincoln , Nora and Union , corresponding roughly to Ballard , Wallingford , Laurelhurst / Sand Point , Phinney / Greenwood and the University District respectively ( the names originally had a first - letter correspondence , but that has become mixed up over various reorganizations ) .
In the map below , you ’ll see that each sector is divided into three sub-sectors .
The idea is that each sector has roughly the same workload , as does each subsector .
Thus , the area encompassing the Ave in the U - District is a sub-sector unto itself ( U3 ) , on par with Laurelhurst , View Ridge , Sand Point and Windermere combined ( L3 ) .
At any given time , there might be six police officers actively patrolling a given sector ( and Capt .
Washburn says he likes to maintain an empty precinct house , preferring to direct and deploy officers from the field ) .
We went in hoping to get some specific questions answered .
We did n’t always like the answers we got , but we did have the feeling that they were being given by honest people making a good faith effort to do the right thing .
Car Prowl
We went in armed with stories our readers had told about repeated thefts and of the police ignoring what we considered strong leads ( e.g. , stolen item found on Craigslist ) .
We were surprised to hear that even if they did find a stolen item on Craigslist , they confirmed that they probably would not bother to arrest the seller .
Why ?
Because without proof that the seller was the actual thief , the arrest would n’t hold up in court .
In the past , we were told , sellers have simply made up stories about how they came into possession of the stolen items and , given the legal requirements for proof , the seller goes free .
But surely they could use the single item to get a warrant to search the seller ’s house , where they would certainly find hundreds of stolen GPS ’s , iPods and three of our car stereos , right ?
Apparently , not .
They asserted that a judge would n’t issue a search warrant unless there was probably cause to believe that there was additional stolen merchandise in the seller ’s home .
What ’s the point of reporting the item if the police are n’t going to make an effort to recover it and arrest the perpetrator ?
Two reasons , we were told :
They do catch people , sometimes with carloads of obviously stolen goods , but if the items have n’t been reported stolen , the perpetrators have to be released .
“ It pains us when we pull someone over with a crapload of things we know are stolen , and nobody reported them , ” Capt Washburn said , using the only bit of colorful language elicited during the hour long conversation .
They use the counts of crimes to determine how , when and where to deploy their units .
If there ’s a rash of car prowls reported in an area , presumably that area will see increased police surveillance .
This second point rang a bit hollow on further digging .
The reporting and crime analysis system the department has is painfully antiquated .
We were already made aware of this by the instructions we were given to pull police reports for our area : go to the precinct office in person where they will give you a DVD that you can use in their lobby to review a database of reports spanning the past 72 hours .
Oh , and bring your own paper if you want to print anything out .
Still , we had assumed that this cumbersome process was intentionally difficult , to discourage citizens from actually examining the details of police activity .
Not so , we were told .
In fact , the police department itself does n’t have much more efficient access to records .
A request for a report on a particular incident requires submitting a request and waiting sometimes days or weeks for the appropriate records to be pulled .
There is apparently only one “ analyst ” for the North Precinct .
In this age of Google and Web 2.0 , we find this Gilliamesque system mind - boggling .
Capt .
Washburn said , with some regret , that a more high - tech solution had been offered , free of charge ( in exchange for guineau pig- hood ) , by Microsoft some years ago , but that the offer had been rejected .
He regretted that decision was made .
Having had more than our fair share of experience living with Microsoft beta products , we ’re not so sure .
That said , there is some hope on the horizon : in the next several months a new system , Versadex , will go into effect , that will automate many parts of the dispatching and reporting system , including creating a single flow of data from initial contact through dispatch to incident report to follow - up .
In a move that brings the police department squarely into the future realized by car rental companies 10 years ago , they will also be using GPS to identify the location of all squad cars at any given time , allowing for more efficient deployment .
More regular crime reports , though , so we can learn , for example , whether some particular type of crime is up or down over the last several months in some area , or whether there is in fact a pattern of crime emerging , is still years away .
Sad .
Policing the Police
We have heard a number of complaints regarding police response when an incident was reported .
In addition to the notorious “ go confront the perp yourself ” advice , another commenter reported being mocked by a detective caring that someone had camped out in her back yard ( “ so they had a picnic ? ” ) .
For this , we were told that they would appreciate it if when such incidents occurred , the citizen report it to the police supervisor so the issue can be addressed .
If you are unhappy with the way a police officer has responded to you , call the precinct office , 206 684 0850 and ask to speak to the desk officer , the sergeant in charge or , if you prefer , give the officer ’s name that you spoke with and ask to speak to his or her commanding officer .
We know , it sounds like a hassle , but if we do n’t report it and give the police commanders the feedback about who ’s doing a good job and who needs additional direction , we really can’t complain that they ’re not improving .
Now , if you report an incident , and do n’t get a satisfying response , please let Wallyhood know , and we ’ll be happy to use this forum to get attention paid to your issue .
We hope this has been helpful .
Sorry fo the longish post .

( CNN ) --
One day recently , Cynthia Newton 's 12 - year - old daughter asked her for help with homework , but Newton did n't want to help her , because she was too busy on Facebook .
So her daughter went upstairs to her room and sent an e-mail asking her for help , but Newton did n't see the e-mail , because , well , she was too busy on Facebook .
The problem exists when a Facebook user crosses the line from social networking into social dysfunction .
" I 'm an addict .
I just get lost in Facebook , " Newton said .
" My daughter gets so PO'd at me , and really it is kind of pathetic .
It 's not something I 'm particularly proud of .
I just get so sucked in . "
Newton ( that 's not her real name ; she 's embarrassed by her Facebook use and requested anonymity ) says she spends about 20 hours a week on the social networking site , half the time for work -- she runs an online business -- and half just for fun .
She 's tried to cut down on her Facebook use but failed .
" I can go a whole day without Facebook , " she said .
" But I 've never made it through an entire weekend . "
Although there are no statistics on " Facebook addiction " -- it is n't an actual medical diagnosis -- therapists say they 're seeing more and more people like Newton who 've crossed the line from social networking to social dysfunction .
" Last Friday , I had three clients in my office with Facebook problems , " said Paula Pile , a marriage and family therapist in Greensboro , North Carolina .
" It 's turned into a compulsion -- a compulsion to dissociate from your real world and go live in the Facebook world . "
Watch more on Facebook addiction »
So how do you know when your Facebook use has turned into a compulsion ?
You can take Pile 's " Facebook Compulsion Inventory " to find out .
Pile and the other therapists interviewed for this article were quick to say that Facebook itself is n't the problem and that the vast majority of its 200 million users probably function just fine .
" I 'm on it myself , " Pile said .
" My daughter just got married , and I got great happiness posting her wedding pictures for all my friends to see . "
She says problems arise when users ignore family and work obligations because they find the Facebook world a more enjoyable place to spend time than the real world .
Newton says she checks Facebook first thing when she wakes up , and then she checks her Facebook page as many as seven times while at work , and then she 'll check Facebook again when she gets home and one more time before she goes to sleep .
If you 've been keeping count , that 's about 10 times a day .
A single parent , Newton includes " Facebook flirting " with men and meeting up with old schoolmates among her favorite activities .
" One old friend told me he had a huge crush on me in kindergarten , and it tore him apart when we were n't put in the same class in first grade , " she said .
" When I read that , it was like , wow .
I blushed at my computer .
I had no idea I was so important to him .
It felt very real and warm and dear . "
The problem is that it 's not real , says Joanna Lipari , a clinical psychologist at the University of California , Los Angeles .
She compares Facebook to " The Truman Show , " the 1998 Jim Carrey movie about a fabricated world where nothing ever goes wrong .
" Facebook is a fun , pleasant , happy , beautiful world .
People only present the crème de la crème of their lives on Facebook .
And these people want to be your friends !
It 's very seductive . "
It 's especially seductive when real life is n't going so well , Pile adds .
" In real life , people have morning breath , and you have to pay bills with them , and you argue about who 's going to change the baby 's diaper , " she said .
" But Facebook is happyland .
You do n't have to deal with any of that . "
Newton says she knows all this and is frustrated at how much time she spends on Facebook , given that she has a job and a child .
" I 've thought about going cold turkey , but that would make me so uncomfortable .
I know I could n't do it . "
You know you 're a Facebook addict when ...
1 . You lose sleep over Facebook
" If you 're staying up late at night because you 're on Facebook , and you 're tired the next day , Facebook may be a compulsion for you , " Lipari said .
" You should n't be neglecting yourself because of Facebook . "
2 . You spend more than an hour a day on Facebook
Pile says it 's hard to pinpoint exactly how much is too much time to be spending on social networking .
" I can't imagine that anyone would need more than an hour a day on Facebook , and probably no one needs more than 30 minutes , " she said .
3 . You become obsessed with old loves
Reconnecting with old friends is one of the great attractions of Facebook , and there 's nothing necessarily wrong with " friending " an old boyfriend or girlfriend .
But Pile warns that it can get out of hand very quickly .
" One of my clients met up with an old boyfriend on Facebook .
They started spending hours and hours into the night talking to each other on Facebook .
She made some really inappropriate comments about how unhappy she was in her marriage , " Pile said .
" Her cousin saw the comments and told her parents , and the parents told the husband , and now they 're in the process of getting divorced . "

4 . You ignore work in favor of Facebook
" If you 're not doing your job in order to sneak time on Facebook , you could have a real problem , " Lipari said .
5 . The thought of getting off Facebook leaves you in a cold sweat
Sarah Browne , who writes the Guru of New blog , gave up Facebook for Lent last month when she realized that she had a " mild " addiction to the site .
She 's come up with " Seven Signs You May Be Ready for a Social Media Detox . "
Pile has her own quick test : " Try going a day without Facebook .
If you find it causes you a lot of stress and anxiety , you really need to get some help . "

She had returned to get belongings .
Police say she wanted to get a Pop Tart and he said she could n't have anything .
Police say Andrews pushed and hit Colon , and she stabbed him in the chest , causing a severe wound .
Andrews was taken to a hospital .
His condition was n't immediately known .
She was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and tampering with evidence .
WASHINGTON , Feb 5 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama 's choice to head the CIA said on Thursday he would support " limited " prosecution of any agents who deliberately violated the law in interrogating terrorism suspects .
Former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta , in Senate confirmation hearings on his nomination , broke with outgoing CIA Director Michael Hayden to support a congressional inquiry into the agency 's detention and interrogation program launched after the Sept. 11 attacks .
He said the Senate Intelligence Committee would be an appropriate place for an inquiry " to learn lessons from what happened " in the program , and said he would do everything he could to cooperate .
Terrorism suspects were subjected to harsh interrogation techniques denounced as illegal torture , including , in three cases , simulated drowning or " waterboarding . "
Panetta said he considered " waterboarding " to be torture , but did not support prosecuting agents who relied on high - level legal guidance allowing such techniques .
However , " if there were those who deliberately violated the law , and deliberately took actions which were above and beyond the standards presented to them , then obviously in those limited cases there should be prosecution , " he said .
He said he also suspected the United States had sent some terrorism suspects to other countries for interrogation using harsher techniques that violated U.S. standards .
Hayden has opposed any inquiry into the interrogation program , saying that if agents were to feel legally vulnerable , they would be intimidated in their future work .
Panetta said he would if necessary ask Obama to allow harsher interrogations than those covered by the Army Field Manual , which the president last month set as the government standard .
The manual bans techniques such as waterboarding .
" I would not hesitate , " to seek broader interrogation authority , Panetta said , adding " I think that this president would do nothing that would violate the laws that are in place . "
He promised to tell Congress if Obama were to authorize a departure from standards the president imposed last month .
Panetta is a former U.S. congressman and White House chief of staff under former President Bill Clinton .
He is expected to win easy confirmation , despite his lack of professional experience and some questions from Republicans concerned over his denunciations of torture .
Panetta also said as CIA director he would seek to identify risks related to the global economic crisis .
" What are the consequences of that in terms of stability in the world ? " he said .

Apple 's shutdown demand to a noncommercial , public Internet wiki discussion on making iPods and iPhones compatible with media management software such as WinAmp and Songbird was a violation of the users '
First Amendment rights , according to an April 27 lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The EFF is representing OdioWorks , which publishes and operates a wiki platform known as BluWiki for collaborative authoring and editing on any subject .
Last November , Apple threatened legal action against OdioWorks if the company did not remove certain pages from BluWiki carrying a discussion on how to reverse - engineer iPods and iPhones so they can interoperate with software other than Apple 's own iTunes software .
Apple claimed the BluWiki discussions constituted copyright infringement and a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 's prohibition on circumventing copy protection measures .
OdioWorks , fearing Apple 's legal liability threats , took down the discussions from the BluWiki site .
" I take the free speech rights of BluWiki users seriously , " Sam Odio , owner of OdioWorks , said in a statement .
" Companies like Apple should not be able to censor online discussions by making baseless legal threats against services like BluWiki that host the discussions . "
OdioWorks ' lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that the discussions do not violate any of the DMCA 's anti-circumvention provisions and do not infringe any copyrights owned by Apple .
" Apple 's legal threats against BluWiki are about censorship , not about protecting their legitimate copyright interests , " EFF Senior Staff Attorney Fred von Lohmann said in a statement .
" Wikis and other community sites are home to many vibrant discussions among hobbyists and tinkerers .
It 's legal to engage in reverse engineering in order to create a competing product , it 's legal to talk about reverse engineering and it's legal for a public wiki to host those discussions . "
BABloggee Greg Smith told me about this video , which is actually quite beautiful to watch .
Nice choice of music , too .
Timescapes Timelapse : Learning to Fly from Tom @ Timescapes on Vimeo I used to take a lot of astrophotos when I was younger , and when I took long exposures and there was scattered light -- from the Moon , say , or a street light -- the sky would be blue , you could see trees , yet there would still be visible stars in the sky .
It was eerie , and this video catches that well .
See if you can spot Orion and the Andromeda galaxy in the video !
In this series I 've explained why Perl roles exist , and discussed Perl roles versus inheritance and Perl roles versus duck typing .
Comments on the latter posting have raised several good questions that I 'll address in another posting .
In particular , some people see the relative informalism of duck typing as a major benefit and rarely see value in other possibilities for abstraction and safety that roles provide .
( Sometimes that 's the right choice , too . )
Today 's topic takes the opposite approach .
Subclassing Inheritance
Many people who learned object orientation through languages such as Java and C++ see inheritance as a vital component to managing large programs .
I 've argued before that this type of inheritance ( by which I mean " a subclass extends a superclass " ) provides two features .
First , the language 's type system understands that a subclass / superclass relationship means that it 's safe to substitute an instance of a subclass in any code which expects an instance of a superclass .
Second , the subclass may ( mostly ) transparently reuse code defined in the superclass with little or no syntax required .
In other words , subclassing inheritance provides a mechanism of code reuse and a mechanism of identifying safe substitutability .
This works great when you can model all of the entities in your program in a singly - rooted hierarchy .
Many simple programs do this effectively .
As the difficulty for creating sane biological taxonomies indicates , the real world does not lend itself to such artificial simplicity .
( Extinction of the duck - billed platypus might have helped Linnaeus -- thanks to educated foo 's suggestion for correcting this analogy -- but I 'd miss the little guys .
Besides that , I can't give birth to live young myself , so I 'm obviously not a mammal . )
This is miles from the interesting question , however .
I assert that the real and proper question for any API which wants to assert a property about the objects it affects is " Do you behave in a way consistent with my expectations ? "
In other words , it 's much less interesting and much less general to say " My log_message ( ) function requires an instance of a String as its argument " than to say " My log_message ( ) function requires an instance of something which Stringifies . "
If an object of one type can stand in for an object of another type , does it matter how that object does so ?
Hold onto that thought .
Abstract Base Classes
If you 're arguing in your head right now saying " Program to an interface , not an implementation ! " you 're absolutely right .
Well - encapsulated programs define well - understood APIs and let the internals of those APIs worry about themselves .
As long as you know that an object ( whatever its type ) implements the proper interface , surely you can get on with your programming and let it go its own way .
One mechanism of ensuring that all object instances of a class a hierarchy implement the proper interface is to specify that interface in an abstract base class from which all classes in that hierarchy inherit .
If you 've programmed in C , you might recognize this as a somewhat more modern descendent of a separate header file ( unless you put executable code in your public header files , in which case no advice I give will help you ) .
Depending on the strictness and dynamicism of your language and compiler and runtime environment , you might get a compile - time warning that any subclass of this ABC implements all of the required methods rather than inheriting them .
In other words , you do get the enforcement of this contract without all of that pesky code reuse .
If you believe that Don't Repeat Yourself is important in software -- and it is -- you may have the unenviable task of rooting around in a singly - rooted inheritance hierarchy to push concrete method implementations to the root of the tree where you have to maintain less duplicate code .
This is why concrete base classes often contain a lot of methods that may or may not apply to all of their subclasses .
Copy and paste seems wronger than overinheritance from god classes .
Some languages suggest that a singly - rooted inheritance hierarchy creates more problems than it solves , and they allow any class to inherit from multiple parents .
This solves the code reuse problem to an extent , but it creates other problems related to the structural layout of objects of multiple classes , potential conflicts in attribute names , method resolution and visibility ordering , and circular parent relationships .
These can present debugging difficulty .
Interfaces
Java ( probably wisely ) eschewed multiple inheritance , but recognized that an instance of any given class may conform to multiple interfaces properly .
Thus it provides Java interfaces .
( I 've glossed over the history of this feature by speculating only on its motivation .
Students of programming languages should look at C++ , Eiffel , Objective C , and Sather for a better view of design influences . )
A Java interface is , effectively , an abstract base class from which you do not inherit .
Thus , your Java class can inherit from a parent class and implement as many interfaces as you like .
One benefit of a Java interface is that you can use the name of an interface anywhere you could use the name of a class , and then you can use any object which implements that interface in any API that expects an object which implements that interface , no matter how it implements that interface .
One drawback of the Java interface is that offers no code reuse either .
Think of Java interfaces as slightly safer multiple inheritance without the possibility of code reuse and a slightly worse syntax , and you have them .
Are they really that bad ?
If you use them correctly , no .
Does anyone ?
Concrete Problems
Imagine you have an API written by someone else .
You do n't have the right ( or access or source code ) to change it .
You have to live with it .
You have a method called on a Logger object called log_message ( ) .
It takes a single argument -- a String .
Any String you pass to the logger gets logged to the appropriate place .
Suppose you have an object which represents a Customer -- a name , an address , some notes .
Suppose you want to log the relevant customer information .
Easy , right ?
Just produce a String from the Customer and send that String to the log_message ( ) method .
Except suppose that the library 's version of String supports onoe encoding and the String produced by the Customer object is an incompatible encoding ... or this or that or you just object to the two - step boilerplate code that makes you manually stringify your Customer objects when they already know how to stringify themselves .
A better approach is to change the log_message ( ) signature to decouple it from the concrete String class to an interface which means " Anything which implements this interface produces a String when I call its stringify ( ) method . "
Of course , that means changing the library .
You may not have access to do this .
Suppose you did , however .
You could create an abstract base class from which String could inherit -- if you have permission to modify that library , and if it does n't already inherit from a concrete base class .
You could create an interface which String implements , if you have permission to modify that library .
Perhaps that 's a silly example .
It 's a deliberately simple example .
Imagine that the necessary interface has two methods , or ten .
Imagine that you want to pass in an object which performs its own logging , or diagnostic testing , or remote proxying .
You will likely find that everywhere you want genericity and code reuse decoupled from a singly - rooted inheritance hierarchy you need to program to interfaces , not instantiable classes -- and you use interface types , not classes , in all of your signatures , because you do n't want to prohibit people from doing useful things even if their singly - rooted inheritance hierarchy does n't match yours .
If I 'm right -- if the real question is " Do you understand these methods the same way I understand them in this context ? " -- this is busywork because there 's one glaring flaw in the interface and abstract base class concept : there 's no way of saying " Instances of this class are semantically equivalent and substitutable for instances of that class " unless you manually extract interfaces from every class defined in your system .
Every Class Implies a Role
Here 's one subtle trait of roles : every class declaration also declares a role .
If you define a class :
class MyAwesomeClass { method foo { ... } method bar { ... } method be_very_awesome { ... } }
You can write :
class MyCompletelyUnrelatedClass does MyAwesomeClass { method foo { ... } method bar { ... } method be_very_awesome { ... } }
... and even if there 's no inheritance relationship between these classes ( as you can see , there is n't ) and no formal declaration of the MyAwesomeClass role ( and there is n't ) , you get all of the benefits of roles ( method composition , compile - time API verification , genericity , substitutability ) without having to modify the declaration of MyAwesomeClass , or rejigger its inheritance hierarchy , or extract a role manually .
Any API you 've already written which operates on an instance of MyAwesomeClass will operate safely and correctly on an instance of MyCompletely UnrelatedClass without modification .
You get code reuse too , if you want it .

The big news about Boris Johnson 's first anniversary is that his first anniversary is big news .
Such accolades are normally reserved for presidents .
Nothing in the campaign for direct election in Britain vindicates the cause as much as this fact .
There is no democratic ­accountability without turnout , no ­turnout without publicity , and no publicity without personality .
Direct election boosts them all .
In 2008 Johnson 's election added 10 % to London 's vote .
How many in Britain ever discussed the first years of Mike Whitby , Warren Bradley , Andrew Carter or Richard Leese ?
Who has heard of them , even if they live in Birmingham , Liverpool , Leeds or Manchester , which they happen to rule ?
Denying British cities the elixir of a democracy permitted to German , French or American ones is the establishment 's way of suppressing innovation and dissent .
It keeps power within the club .
It is rubbish .
Johnson 's first year in charge of the capital has refuted the ­malicious forecasts of his foes and ­tentatively confirmed those of his fans .
London has not collapsed into a Billy Bunter comedy routine .
The most incompetent central government of recent times , lauded by Johnson 's enemies , has visited on ­London its most severe postwar crisis .
The mayor has not panicked .
Johnson has had to remove a police chief who lost the confidence of his force and whom the home secretary lacked the guts to sack .
He has honoured his pledges to end bendy buses , put more police into public transport and ban alcohol on the tube .
He cycles every­where , while wrestling with a tube system brought to the brink of bankruptcy by Gordon Brown 's privatisation .
He must now face an economic storm by rebuilding the capital 's economy on something other than speculative froth .
Given the collapse of London 's biggest industry – finance – Johnson has promoted other industries , notably higher education , health and tourism .
He has been less than courageous in trying to curb the lunatic extravagance of Tessa Jowell 's super - Olympics .
Her vast budget simply swamped him .
He also failed , on day one , to kill off Crossrail and divert its resources to ­restore the tube 's physical and emotional health , now approaching financial meltdown .
The mayor 's early U - turn on tall buildings showed a man susceptible to the power of money , proving that Tories capitulate to rich architects / developers as easily as socialists .
The threatened skyscrapers over the South Bank and Waterloo , like those over Ealing and Battersea , should be dubbed , if built , Boris 's babes .
They will be his symbols long after he has gone .
These are the sort of big government decisions that Johnson has yet to show he can grasp .
Yet Johnson has done much to surprise the sceptics .
His forthcoming conference on " a new London vernacular architecture " indicates sensitivity to the city 's environment rare in a city politician .
Perhaps the eye of a cyclist makes him alert to the quality of London streetscape , in contrast to Livingstone 's infatuation with the Foster / Rogers cosmopolitan school of " icons in deserts " .
There is also a real possibility of London getting some version of the Monderman " shared streets " policy – everywhere on the continent but unknown in the overengineered streets of Britain .
Already Johnson is planning to reduce the number of lights , signs , furniture and general clutter , and to end many unnecessary one - way streets .
He claims that pedestrians and cyclists should ­dictate the movement of motor ­vehicles , not the other way round , and that this actually aids traffic flow .
Nor has Johnson ignored the city 's political dynamic .
In a remarkable deal negotiated this week , he declared an intention to tear up the existing relationship between tiers of government in the capital .
He wants the 32 boroughs to appoint their own police commanders and assume control over doctors ' surgeries and primary care budgets .
He is also handing over local bus routing and the regulation of trunk roads .
This could be bloody in the short term .
But nothing is more likely to ­galvanise borough government , ­possibly at the expense of mayoral power .
Since much of it will require central ­government approval , it will also need Johnson to mobilise the full force of his direct mandate .
Devolving democratic accountability for the frontline health service and for neighbourhood policing will take courage and a readiness to risk mistakes .
It is hardly new .
Most of Europe practises it , to general consumer satisfaction .
But in Britain it is a true democratic breakthrough , a decentralisation that has eluded both Labour 's pseudo - localists and David Cameron 's lukewarm devolution .
Since the mayor may need Cameron 's permission , he is putting his former boss firmly on the spot .
Johnson has changed the style and language of politics .
His tendency to make every topic a joke , often at his own expense , was regarded as an engaging liability .
It had appeal outside the charmed circle of political literates , but was predicted to have a short lifespan .
How could you have a mayor who said gosh , crumbs and crikey ; who claimed to have " played God at 10 " ; who wants a " grand smashing of PlayStations " ; and who professed to identify with the Incredible Hulk , since " the madder Hulk gets the stronger Hulk gets " ?
The novelty has endured .
As last year 's campaign showed , the public likes leaders who speak their minds .
However distant from ordinary Londoners Johnson 's patrician personality might seem , it has come across as genuine , unchained by spin and correctness .
What makes him a celebrity , particularly among the young , was not what he says but how he says it .
His artless gaffes have the freshness of sincerity , with none of the humourless artifice of the Westminster village .
Johnson can get away with littering his language with Athens , Pericles , Thucydides and Cicero , because it is done naturally .
Authenticity of any sort is rare today .
A poll this week in the London Evening Standard indicated that Johnson would now trounce his former opponent , Ken Livingstone , winning a remarkable 49 % of those polled .
This is testament enough to his popularity .
Almost all leaders lose traction in their first year .
Yet an intriguing finding is that Alan Sugar , the newly touted ­television tycoon , might beat Johnson by 40 points to 32 .
The implication is that , in civic politics , to be " outside the tent " is a real asset , the further the better .
Both Livingstone and Johnson traded on this factor to win their first elections .
But Johnson still suffers in the poll as a card - carrying Tory .
Sugar combines recognisability and independence with an image of not suffering fools gladly .
Like Johnson he speaks his mind and does not care whom he offends .
He is ambitious and has the party credentials to be well placed as the next , possibly Labour , ­candidate for mayor .
This does not mean Sugar will stay the course .
That he is even in consideration shows how far London politics has moved since direct election transformed darkness into light , how far it has come since leftwing militants could seize power in County Hall in their 1981 corridor coup .
Any Londoner can now think himself Dick Whittington without needing to belong to a political club .

Having kids believe there 's a jolly man in a red suit who visits on Christmas Eve does n't turn out to be very detrimental , according to a new analysis by Serge Larivée , although some parents can feel they 're outright lying to their children and a small percentage of kids feel that way toward their parents .
" When they learn the truth , children accept the rules of the game and even go along with their parents in having younger children believe in Santa , " says Larivée , a psycho-education professor at the Université de Montréal .
" It becomes a rite of passage in that they know they are no longer babies .
" Larivée , along with colleague Carole Sénéchal from the Univerity of Ottawa , examined a study from 1896 involving 1,500 children aged 7 to 13 , which was repeated in 1979 .
More than 46 percent of children in 1896 and 44 percent in 1979 gradually found out on their own that Santa did n't exist .
The studies also analyzed the reaction of the children once they discovered the jolly old elf was n't real .
More than 22 percent in the 1896 study admitted to being disappointed compared with 39 percent in the 1979 study .
But only 2 percent and 6 percent , respectively , felt betrayed .
Is there a benefit to perpetuating Santa Claus ?
Worse , is there harm ?
"
The constant outcome of the two studies was that children generally discovered through their own observations and experiences that Santa does n't exist , " Larivée noted .
" And their parents confirmed their discovery .
" Children ask their parents , for example , how Santa gets in the house if there 's no chimney , " he says .
" And even if the parents say they leave the door unlocked , the child will figure out that Santa can't be everywhere at the same time and that reindeer can't be that fast .
" Close to 25 percent of children in the 1896 study learned the truth about Santa from their parents , compared with 40 per cent in 1979 .
Those who did n't find out from their parents learned the truth from other children .
Larivée says belief in Santa diminishes as children approach the age of reason .
" But cognitive maturity and level of thought that would allow a 7 - year - old to differentiate between the imaginary and reality are insufficient to let go of the myth , " he adds , pointing out that half of children of that age in a 1980 study still believed .
In 1896 , 54 percent of parents said they perpetuated the myth of Santa since it made their children happy ; compared with 73 percent in 1979 and 80 percent in 2000 .
Larivée and Sénéchal now want to explore a deeper question :
If children attribute the same supernatural powers to Santa as they do to God , why do they stop believing in Santa , but continue their belief in God ?
( CNN ) --
When Santiago Martinez wants to give his friends birthday presents , he buys a cake or flowers or sometimes a teddy bear .
' Virtual currencies , ' like the hi5 Coin , shown here , are becoming more important on the Internet .
But the 41 - year - old , who lives on Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula , does n't spend pesos or dollars .
He buys the gifts with an online - only currency called hi5 Coins .
He also does n't deliver the gifts in the physical world .
They appear digitally on his friends ' online profiles on a site called hi5 , which is a social network like Facebook or MySpace .
" They can't eat the cake .
It is an image -- the thing that it represents , " said Martinez , an accountant with a wife and two kids .
" You can send the feeling of that [ cake ] that you want to send . "
In any given month , he spends the equivalent of $ 40 in this manner .
But Martinez is hardly alone .
As our identities migrate further onto the Internet , currencies that exist only online are becoming a more significant part of commerce on the Web and in the real world .
Some , like the hi5 Coin , operate almost like tokens in an arcade or tickets at a fair :
They 're a stand - in for real - world currency .
Other " virtual currencies , " like Second Life 's Linden Dollars , however , are traded on markets .
The currencies also fuel online gaming communities and are becoming an important part of social networks .
Several online currencies are competing to be the economic engines for MySpace and Facebook , which do n't have their own unified currencies .
Other social networking sites , like hi5 and myYearbook , have created their own units of money for their users to spend .
All of this movement leads some experts to see a future in which virtual currencies enter the same trading space as their real - world counterparts .
The online monies are not robust enough to trade competitively against real - world currencies , but people underestimate the large amount of cash that is transferred from the real world into virtual currencies , said Edward Castronova , a professor of telecommunications at Indiana University .
Castronova says people transfer at least $ 1 billion into the virtual currencies each year , with most of that money going into online games .
The actual amount could be much higher , he said , but the market is hard to quantify .
" The question is really one of scale , " he said .
" Is this big enough for someone to take their 401 ( k ) [ out of real - world currency ] and start looking into this ?
No , absolutely not . "
Sometimes , people collect online money simply by purchasing it .
In " World of Warcraft , " players earn WoW Gold as they advance through the game .
The currency has become so sought - after that it is bought and sold on a black market , experts said .
Low - wage workers in China are known to play the game for a living and then sell the virtual currency they earn to avid " World of Warcraft " players in the West .
This despite the fact that the game 's maker prohibits such activities .
As the market for online - only currency grows , problems that plague real - world economies start leaking in , said Charles Hudson , who runs the Virtual Goods Summit , an annual conference .
" Once you get a virtual economy that 's functioning , you run into all the problems that we have with the real economy : taxation , interest rates , inflation .
All of the same problems that cause headaches for the Federal Reserve come up in the virtual economy -- and the stakes are the same , " he said .
The solution has been for each social network or game that uses its own currency to appoint a money manager .
Hi5 , for instance , employs a staff economist for this purpose .
The site soon hopes to make as much money through its virtual currency exchange as it does from advertising , which is the primary revenue source for many social networks .
Mark Methenitis , a Dallas attorney who writes a blog called " Law of the Game , " said online currencies are " completely unregulated , " which will make trading them against each other dangerous .
" There is huge potential for fraud , for what would be the equivalent of insider trading , " he said .
" Also , since these economies are completely under the control of the virtual world owner , it 's pretty easy to cause massive hyperinflation . "
Social networks and virtual worlds are currently trying to find ways to manage or capitalize on their developing economies .
These networks ' successes may hinge on how they are able to manage their economies and currencies may , experts said .
Facebook is researching the idea of creating a unified currency but is " very early " in the process and has not committed to it , the site said in a statement to CNN .
Currently , applications on the site -- which allow users to play games with each other and trade gifts -- are powered by currencies made by the application 's developers , not by Facebook .
These developers are making good money on the system , and Facebook is missing out on profits in that area , said Hudson , of the Virtual Goods Summit .
Joey Seiler , who writes about virtual worlds , said virtual goods are becoming more popular because people are taking their online identities more seriously .
At first , it may seem ridiculous that someone would pay for virtual currency in order to buy a T - shirt icon to put on a social - network profile .
But Seiler said more or his friends see the virtual T - shirts on his Facebook page than see any T - shirt he wears in real life .
So being able to spice up his online identity has real value , he said .

HOLLYWOOD star Patrick Stewart launched a foul - mouthed tirade at a fan who took a picture of him onstage .
He called the man an " a*** hole " as he queued to get the actor 's autograph following a stage performance .
The 68 - year - old X - Men star is touring with acting legend Sir Ian McKellan in Samuel Becket 's classic play Waiting For Godot .
As the fan waited outside the King 's Theatre in Edinburgh afterwards , Stewart pointed his fingers and shouted : " Can you sleep at night ? "
His co-star Sir Ian looked shocked by the outburst which Stewart continued as he signed other autographs .
A witness said : " There were at least 40 people waiting for autographs and this guy had a big camera and was waiting with a woman at the front of the queue .
Rude
" One of the backstage people came out and said the actors would n't pose for pictures or sign anything other than show material in a rather pompous tone . "
Actor Ronald Pickup was first out followed by Stewart and then McKellan .
The witness added : " The woman the guy was with was getting her programme signed .
" Stewart suddenly looked up and said , ' Are you the a *** hole who was sitting at the front tonight ?
You know , what I really want to know is how you can sleep at night ?
I really hope you 're pleased with yourself ' .
" The woman was horrified and clearly upset and walked off but the guy brassed it out .
" Someone said he tried to take a sneaky picture of McKellan and Stewart taking their encore at the end of the show and was caught by one of the stewards . "
Another witness said : " I think they thought he was paparazzi or something because he had such a big camera but he did n't do anybody harm . "
A spokeswoman for the theatre said : " It is generally regarded as rude and inconsiderate to take photographs during a live performance of this kind .
" The theatre displays signs throughout the building that photography and filming on any recording device is strictly prohibited .
" We have received a number of complaints from performers and audience .
It is very disappointing that these people are willing to risk ruining the evening for everyone else . "
Stewart is best known for his roles as Captain Jean - Luc Picard in Star Trek : TNG and Professor Xavier in the X - Men films .

The new discovery is believed to be part of a torso A new body part has been found by police investigating the discovery of human remains in two counties .
Police were called to Gore Lane in Ware , Hertfordshire on Saturday , and have sealed - off the road .
A spokesman said part of a torso had been found , close to the A10 road , which had been there " for some time " .
It was likely to be from the same man whose left leg , head and arms have been found in Leicestershire and Hertfordshire , he confirmed .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The major crime unit for Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire is on the scene , and the Leicestershire force has been notified .
The latest find comes after a member of the public found a right leg - also thought , police said , " highly likely " to be from the same man - near a lay - by , also on the A10 Puckeridge bypass , last Tuesday .
The man 's head was earlier found in a Leicestershire field and a forearm and left leg from the same body were found in Hertfordshire .
MAP OF BODY PART FINDS 1 : 22 March : left leg found at Cottered 2 : 29 March : forearm found at Wheathampstead 3 : 31 March : head found at Asfordby 4 : 7 April : right leg found at Puckeridge 5 : 11 April : torso found at Gore Lane , Ware
The left leg was found in a field near the A507 at Cottered on 22 March and the forearm was discovered in nearby Wheathampstead a week later .
The head was found on 31 March near a cemetery in Hoby Road Asfordby .
Tests " forensically linked " the head with the forearm and legs .
Det Ch Insp Michael Hanlon , of Hertfordshire Police , has previously given details about the victim 's appearance .
He said the man is believed to have suffered from a form of fungal infection to his toenails , with his small toenails " discoloured and thickened " and curled under .
" The victim had two front teeth missing , " he said .
" They are the front right tooth and the tooth to the immediate right of that .
" They are believed to have been missing for several years . "

Greater WIngnuttia is all alarums and excursions because Obama " bowed down " before KIng Abdullah of Saudi Arabia ; they 've even done the hard research and checked Miss Manners to prove that this portends the immediate imposition of sharia law all throughout the American Heartland .
Of course , when you watch the video that Malkin claims proves Obama was kowtowing to the Muslim Monarch , you note that Obama is about a foot taller than Abdullah , and so had to kind of contort himself to get into any sort of position to shake the sheikh 's hand .
( Ha ha that is a joke , shake the sheikh 's hand . )
Of course , interpretations will differ ; personally I think the Saudi King was deliberately positioning himself in the video so as to show off his tits to the lascivious American chief executive .
So much is clear .
But watch it yourself .
( warning , the language in the clip is not American , so you 'll probably want to clamp your hands over your ears so as to keep them properly patriotic . )
The other thing to note is that this is not a state meeting between just the two leaders , it 's a freaking informal situation , people milling about confusedly before a group photo is taken .
" Protocol " is usually invoked in formal situations , because , like , that 's what makes formal situations formal .
You know , formal as in the setting of this particular picture :
MORE FUN .
In an attempt to prove that Obama is a " tool " because he gave the Queen an iPod , obvious Miss Manners devotee and Fastidious Sniffer of Protocol Curt from Flopping Nutsacks informs us that we were all much better off when the suave , debonaire man of the world George W. Bush was in charge , because his gliffs were just so delightfully classy :
President and Mrs. Bush gave Her Majesty a bronze statuette “ High Desert Princess ” with a personal inscription on the bottom of the base .
It is a replica of the original life size statue that is located in front of the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Ft. Worth , Texas .
And , if you unscrew the head off that statuette , it contains gen - u- wine Texas American sippin ' whiskey !
AND MORE !
Via Steve M. Here is Dick Cheney and the Saudi King .
This notion that ' I was just obeying orders ' -- I do n't want to compare this to Nazi Germany , but we 've come to almost ridicule the notion that when horrific acts have been committed that people can use the excuse that , ' Well , I was just following orders ' ...
In general , I think that contractors need to be held accountable for what they do , but particularly the inventors of the program .
The president has stated that it is not his administration 's intention to prosecute those who acted reasonably and relied in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice .
As I understand it , his decision does not mean that anyone who engaged in activities that the Department had not approved , those who gave improper legal advice or those who authorized the program could not be prosecuted .
The details made public in these memos paint a horrifying picture and reveal how the Bush administration 's lawyers and top officials were complicit in torture .
The so - called enhanced interrogation program was a violation of our core principles as a nation and those responsible should be held accountable .
The Americans Civil Liberties Union deserves credit for suing for the memos ’ release .
And President Obama deserves credit for overruling his own C.I.A. director and ordering that the memos be made public .
It is hard to think of another case in which documents stamped “ Top Secret ” were released with hardly any deletions .
But this cannot be the end of the scrutiny for these and other decisions by the Bush administration .
Until Americans and their leaders fully understand the rules the Bush administration concocted to justify such abuses -- and who set the rules and who approved them -- there is no hope of fixing a profoundly broken system of justice and ensuring that that these acts are never repeated ... [ A ] as far as Mr. Bush ’s lawyers were concerned , it was not really torture unless it involved breaking bones , burning flesh or pulling teeth .
That , Mr. Bybee kept noting , was what the Libyan secret police did to one prisoner .
The standard for American behavior should be a lot higher than that of the Libyan secret police .
At least Mr. Obama is not following Mr. Bush ’s example of showy trials for the small fry -- like Lynndie England of Abu Ghraib notoriety .
But he has an obligation to pursue what is clear evidence of a government policy sanctioning the torture and abuse of prisoners -- in violation of international law and the Constitution .
That investigation should start with the lawyers who wrote these sickening memos , including John Yoo , who now teaches law in California ; Steven Bradbury , who was job - hunting when we last heard ; and Mr. Bybee , who holds the lifetime seat on the federal appeals court that Mr. Bush rewarded him with .
These memos make it clear that Mr. Bybee is unfit for a job that requires legal judgment and a respect for the Constitution .
Congress should impeach him .
And if the administration will not conduct a thorough investigation of these issues , then Congress has a constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable .
If that means putting Donald Rumsfeld and Alberto Gonzales on the stand , even Dick Cheney , we are sure Americans can handle it .
After eight years without transparency or accountability , Mr. Obama promised the American people both .
His decision to release these memos was another sign of his commitment to transparency .
We are waiting to see an equal commitment to accountability .
Sometimes when really difficult , nuanced issues come up that require an especially great depth of understanding I wake up in the morning hoping that Ken tackled it on East Coast time .
But so farhas n't really looked into the moral imperatives enmeshed in the release of the Bush Regime torture documents .
I think about it everyday and I read as much of Digby 's reporting as I can before making myself sick .
And then I invariably wind up turning to Glenn Greenwald 's seering analysis as quickly as he gets it online at Salon , just in case there 's any chance I could sleep at night .
Yesterday , almost in passing , we decried the lack of real leadership from our political class , with just a few exceptions .
The one we pointed out this time -- rather than the usual Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) or Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) -- was Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) , one of the few brave souls in elective office willing to go on record denouncing this week 's teabaggery for what it was : " It ’s despicable that right - wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant , honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt .
Not a single American household or business will be taxed at a higher rate this year .
Made to look like a grassroots uprising , this is an Obama bashing party promoted by corporate interests , as well as Republican lobbyists and politicians .
” Schakowsky 's leadership instincts hardly ended there .
Maybe she 's reading Greenwald and Digby too-- or maybe just the reports that come to the House Intelligence Committee -- but she puts the rest of her political party -- from top to bottom -- to shame for their complicity after the fact in the Bush Regime torture scandal .
There is no acceptable defense for torture and the fact that some disgraceful hack lawyers hired by the rogue regime to give torture a patina of legality cannot be allowed to pass as an excuse .
" Just following orders " is what Nazi concentration camp guards claimed ; we did n't let them get away with it .
But it was the top dogs in the Nazi and Tojoist regimes , or a few of them , who hung .
Am I making a case that Bush and Cheney and Gonzales and their top cronies be hung ?
If you have to ask , you 're probably new atAnd from the highest trees or in the biggest town squares .
The Obama administration did the right thing in releasing the torture memos , but they very much did the wrong thing in declaring that the torturers who were following orders from the White House would n't be prosecuted .
Prosecutions should begin at the top , with Bush and Cheney .
Schakowsky is the chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and she was interviewed by Ryan Grim at HuffPo this week .
If Obama plans to let the CIA and " contractors " skip out free and clear , will he at least appoint a special prosecutor for the criminals who gave the orders and gussied up the process ?
Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) implies he may .
Feingold : Who is Jay Bybee ?
And why impeached ?
Tomorrow ' sexplains all that in an editorial , The Torturers ' Manifesto that starts from the premise that the Bush DoJ memos on torture are a " journey into depravity . "
Jay Bybee was an assistant attorney general and waterboarding advocate and admirer .
Today he 's a federal judge .
Bybee 's aim in writing the memos was to provide " legal immunity for acts that are clearly illegal , immoral and a violation of this country ’s most basic values . "
It appears like Obama is playing along too .
Not pot heads rotting in prisons , of course , but anyone and everyone involved with torture related war crimes should be free to go about life as though nothing had happened .
I knew it was a bad sign when Obama picked Emanuel as Chief of Staff .
Labels : accountability , Jan Schakowsky , Rahm Emanuel , Russ Feingold , torture

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers have found the first common genetic link to autism and said on Tuesday it could potentially account for 15 percent of the disease ’s cases .

Three studies , two in the journal Nature and one in Molecular Psychiatry , suggest changes in brain connections could underlie some cases .
While the findings do not immediately offer hope for a treatment , they do help explain the underlying causes of the condition , which affects as many as one in 150 children , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
“ These findings establish that genetic factors play a strong role in autism spectrum disorder , ” National Institutes of Health acting director Dr. Raynard Kington said in a statement .
“ Detailed analysis of the genes and how they affect brain development is likely to yield better strategies for diagnosing and treating children with autism . ”
Autism refers to a spectrum of diseases , from severe and profound inability to communicate and mental retardation , to relatively mild symptoms called Asperger ’s syndrome .
Doctors have been at a loss to explain it , although it has been clear autism can often run in families , suggesting a genetic cause .
“ Previous studies have suggested that autism is a developmental disorder resulting from abnormal connections in the brain .
These three studies suggest some of the genetic factors which might lead to abnormal connectivity , ” Dr. Thomas Insel , director of NIH ’s National Institute of Mental Health , said in a statement .
INTERNATIONAL SEARCH
The international team of researchers looked at DNA from more than 12,000 people , some from families affected by autism , and unaffected volunteers .
“ We estimate that the variants we discovered may contribute to as many as 15 percent of autism spectrum disorder cases in a population , ” Dr. Hakon Hakonarson of Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia , who worked on the study , said in a statement .
“ Most of the genes that have been identified in these studies are involved in the connections between neurons called synapses , ’ said Tony Monaco of the Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics at Britain ’s University of Oxford , who worked on the study , said in a statement .
“ This does seem to fit with what we know from brain scans -- that people with autism may show different or reduced connectivity between different parts of the brain . ”
The mutations are not unique to people with autism .
“ While this gene variant is common in the general population , we discovered that it occurs about 20 percent more often in children with autism , ” said Dr. Daniel Geschwind of the University of California Los Angeles , who worked on the study .
“ Until now , no common genetic variant has been identified with such overwhelming evidence to support its role in autism spectrum disorders , ” added Dr. Margaret Pericak - Vance of the University of Miami .
This figure shows levels of nonlocality as measured by the CHSH Bell inequality .
Classical nonlocal correlations ( green ) are at 2 and below ; quantum nonlocal correlations ( red ) are above 2 but below Tsirelson ’s bound ( B Q ) ; and post - quantum nonlocal correlations ( light blue ) are above and , in some cases , below Tsirelson ’s bound .
BCC marks the “ bound of triviality , ” above which correlations are unlikely to exist .
In the current study , scientists found that post - quantum correlated nonlocal boxes ( dark blue line ) are also unlikely to exist , despite some boxes being arbitrarily close to being classical .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
When it comes to nonlocal correlations , some correlations are more nonlocal than others .
As the subject of study for several decades , nonlocal correlations ( for example , quantum entanglement ) exist between two objects when they can somehow directly influence each other even when separated by a large distance .
Because these correlations require “ passion - at - a- distance ” ( a term coined by physicist Abner Shimony ) , they violate the principle of locality , which states that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light ( even though quantum correlations cannot be used to communicate faster than the speed of light ) .
Besides being a fascinating phenomenon , nonlocality can also lead to powerful techniques in computing , cryptography , and information processing .
Quantum Limits
Despite advances in quantum research , physicists still do n’t fully understand the fundamental nature of nonlocality .
In 1980 , mathematician Boris Tsirelson found that quantum correlations are bounded by an upper limit ; quantum nonlocality is only so strong .
Later , in 1994 , physicists Sandu Popescu and Daniel Rohrlich made another surprising discovery : a particular kind of correlation might exist above the “ Tsirelson bound , ” as well as below the bound , in a certain range ( see image ) .
These so - called post - quantum correlations are therefore “ more nonlocal ” than quantum correlations .
“ Tsirelson 's bound represents the most nonlocal ‘ boxes ’ that can be created with quantum mechanics , ” Nicolas Brunner , a physicist at the University of Bristol , told PhysOrg.com .
“ Nonlocality here is measured by the degree of violation of a Bell inequality .
So , quantum non-locality appears to be limited .
The big question is why .
That is , is there a good physical reason why post - quantum correlations do n’t seem to exist in nature ? ”
In a recent study , Brunner and coauthor Paul Skrzypczyk , also of the University of Bristol , propose an explanation for why post - quantum correlations are unlikely to exist , which may reveal insight into why quantum nonlocality is bounded , as well as into the underlying difference between quantum and post - quantum correlations .
In their study , Brunner and Skrzypczyk have shown that a certain class of post - quantum correlations is unlikely to exist due to the fact that it makes communication complexity trivial .
This triviality occurs due to the fact that the nonlocality of these correlations can be enhanced beyond a critical limit , and - surprisingly - in spite of the fact that some of these correlations are arbitrarily close to classical correlations ( they give an arbitrarily small violation of Bell ’s inequality ) .
As previous research has suggested , any theory in which communication complexity is trivial is very unlikely to exist .
Beyond Quantum
“ ’ Post - quantum ’ means beyond quantum , ” Brunner explained .
“ This term applies to correlations , which are conveniently - and probably most simply - described by ‘ black boxes . ’
The basic idea is the following : imagine a black box shared by two distant parties Alice and Bob ; each party is allowed to ask a question to the box ( or make a measurement on the box , if you prefer ) and then gets an answer ( a measurement outcome ) .
By repeating this procedure many times , and at the end comparing their respective results , Alice and Bob can identify what their box is doing .
For instance , it could be that the outcomes are always the same whenever Alice and Bob choose the same questions .
This kind of behavior is a correlation ; knowing one outcome , it is possible to deduce the other one , since both outcomes are correlated .
“ Now , it happens that there exist different types of correlations ; basically those that can be understood with classical physics ( where correlations originate from a common cause ) , and those that cannot .
This second type of correlation is called nonlocal , in the sense that it cannot be explained by a common cause .
A priori it is not obvious to tell whether some correlations are local or not .
The way physicists can tell this is by testing a Bell inequality ; when a Bell inequality is violated , then the correlations cannot be local ; that is , there cannot exist a common cause to these correlations .
“ Now , an amazing thing about quantum mechanics is that it allows one to construct boxes that are non-local .
This is quantum nonlocality .
Now , it happens that not all nonlocal boxes can be constructed in quantum mechanics .
Thus there exist correlations which are unobtainable in quantum mechanics .
These are called post - quantum correlations .
In general , post - quantum correlations can be above Tsirelson ’s bound , but in some very specific cases , they can also be below . ”
‘ Distilling ’ Post - Quantum Nonlocality
To demonstrate that post - quantum correlations cannot exist in nature , Brunner and Skrzypczyk developed a protocol for deterministically distilling nonlocality in post - quantum states .
That is , the technique refines weakly nonlocal states into states with greater nonlocality .
In this context , “ distillation ” can also be thought of as “ purifying , ” “ amplifying , ” or “ maximizing ” the nonlocality of post - quantum correlations .
Since nonlocal correlations are more useful if they are stronger , maximizing nonlocality has significant implications for quantum information protocols .
The physicists ’ protocol works specifically with “ correlated nonlocal boxes , ” which are a particular class of post - quantum boxes .
Brunner and Skrzypczyk ’s distillation protocol builds on a recent breakthrough by another team ( Forster et al. ) , who presented the first nonlocality distillation protocol just a few months ago .
However , the Forster protocol can distill correlated nonlocal boxes only up to a certain point , violating a Bell inequality called the Clauser - Horne - Shimony - Holt ( CHSH ) inequality only up to CHSH = 3 .
While this value is greater than Tsirelson ’s bound of 2.82 , it does not reach the bound of 3.26 , which marks the point at which communication complexity becomes trivial .
Taking a step forward , Brunner and Skrzypczyk ’s protocol can distill nonlocality all the way up to the maximum nonlocality of the Popescu - Rohrlich box , which is 4 .
In passing the 3.26 bound of triviality , they show that these post - quantum correlated nonlocal boxes do indeed collapse communication complexity .
The distillation protocol is executed by two distant parties that share two weakly correlated nonlocal boxes .
Each party can input one bit into a box to receive one output bit , simulating a binary input / binary output system with local operations .
As the scientists explain , a distillation protocol can be viewed as a way of classically wiring the two boxes together .
The protocol is a choice of four wirings , one for each input of Alice and Bob .
The wiring ( algorithm ) that determines the outbit bits of the boxes will transform the two nonlocal boxes into a single correlated nonlocal box , which has stronger nonlocality than the two individual boxes .
Importantly , this protocol can distill any correlated nonlocal box that violates the CHSH inequality by less than a limit of 3.26 to more than 3.26 .
In other words , any correlated nonlocal box that has not previously made communication complexity trivial can be made to do so .
Surprisingly , some of these boxes can even be arbitrarily close to being classical ( below or equal to 2 ) , and yet , since they can be distilled beyond the “ bound of triviality , ” they still collapse communication complexity .
According to previous studies of triviality , such boxes are very unlikely to exist - even those below Tsirelson ’s bound .
Trivial Complexity
Theoretically , when communication complexity is trivial , even the most complex problems can be solved with a minimum amount of communication .
In the following example , Brunner explains what would happen in real life if a single bit of information could solve any problem .
“ Communication complexity is an information processing task , ” Brunner said .
“ Here is an example .
Suppose you and I would like to meet during the next year ; so given our respective agendas , we would like to know whether there is a day where both of us are free or whether there is not ; does n’t matter what that day is , we just want to know whether there is such a day or not .
Since we are in distant locations , we must send each other some information to solve the problem .
For instance , if I send you the whole information about my agenda , then you could find out whether a meeting is possible or not ( and so solve the problem ) .
But indeed that implies that I should send you a significant quantity of information ( many bits ) .
It turns out that in classical physics ( or , if you prefer , in everyday life ) , there is no better strategy ; I really have to send you all that information .
In quantum physics , though there exist stronger correlations than in classical physics ( quantum nonlocal correlations ) , I would still have to send you an enormous amount of communication .
“ Now , the really astonishing thing is that , if you have access to certain post - quantum correlations ( post - quantum boxes ) , a single bit of communication is enough to solve this problem !
In other words , communication complexity becomes trivial in these theories , since one bit of communication is enough to solve any problem like this one .
Importantly , in classical or quantum physics , communication complexity is not trivial .
More generally , for computer scientists , a world in which communication complexity becomes trivial is highly unlikely to exist .
Previously , it was known that post - quantum boxes with a very high degree of violation of a Bell inequality make communication complexity trivial ; now , the astonishing thing about our result is that we show that some correlations with a very small degree of violation of a Bell inequality - but indeed not accessible with quantum mechanics - can also make communication complexity trivial . ”
Post - Quantum Future
In the future , Brunner and Skrzypczyk hope to find improved distillation protocols that might work for a wider variety of post - quantum nonlocal boxes , not only correlated nonlocal boxes .
More research is also needed to explain why quantum correlations cannot exist in the gap between Tsirelson ’s bound and the bound of triviality .
Ultimately , this line of research could help make a distinction between quantum and post - quantum correlations , with important theoretic implications .
“ The greatest implications of our results are the following , ” Brunner said .
“ First , they give new evidence that certain post - quantum theories allow for a dramatic increase in communication power compared to quantum mechanics , and therefore appear very unlikely to exist in nature .
The nice thing , in particular , is that some of these theories allow only for little nonlocality ( as measured by the degree of violation of a Bell inequality ) .
Thus our result is a striking demonstration that we still have no clue on how to correctly measure nonlocality .
Finally , it is one step further towards an information - theoretic axiom for quantum mechanics . ”

As it seems advanced dispatch schemes are discussed right now under the pattern matching label .
In this article I want to discuss another solution using a data - structure called the TupleTree ( also known as prefix tree or trie ) .
The tuple tree solution comes closer to PEAK rules than to Marius Eriksens pattern matching engine .
I find it more elegant than the PEAK rules solution and there is less boilerplate .
I ca n’t say much about the generality of PEAK rules though and they might cover a lot more .
A TupleTree is an efficient way to store tuples by factoring out common prefixes .
Suppose you have a set of tuples :
{ ( a , b , c ) , ( a , b , d ) , ( a , c , d ) , ( b , d , d ) } then you can store the same information using a tree structure
{ ( a , ( b , ( ( c , ) ( d , ) ) ) , ( c , d ) ) , ( b , d , d ) }
Searching in the tuple tree is of complexity O ( log (n ) ) and can degenerate to O( n ) if there is is n’t much to factorize .
This is n’t too interesting in the discussion of pattern matching schemes if we would n’t introduce two different kinds of wildcards or symbolic pattern called ANY and ALL .
ANY – a pattern that matches any symbol but with the lowest priority : if there is a tuple ( ANY , Y , … ) in the tuple tree then ( X , Y , … ) is matched by ( ANY , Y , … ) iff there is n’t a more specific matching tuple ( X , Y , … ) in the tree .
ALL – a pattern that matches any symbol but with the same priority as a more specific symbol .
If there is a tuple ( ALL , Y , … ) in the tuple tree then ( X , Y , … ) is matched by ( ALL , Y , … ) and by a more specific tuple ( X , Y , … ) if present .
This means ALL creates an ambiguity .
We can consider ALL as a variable and we eliminate the ambiguity using value substitution .
Let ’s say we have a set of tuples { ( ANY , Y ) , ( X , Y ) , ( ALL , Z ) } then elimination of ALL leads to { ( ANY , Y ) , ( ANY , Z ) , ( X , Y ) , ( X , Z ) } and the tuple tree {( ANY , ( Y , ) , ( Z , ) ) , ( X , ( Y , ) , ( Z , ) ) } .
TupleTree implementation
First we define the mentioned pattern ANY and ALL
class Pattern : def __init__ ( self , name ) : self .
name = name def __repr__ ( self ) : return " < P : %s > " % self .
name ANY = Pattern ( " ANY " ) ALL = Pattern ( " ALL " )
Now we create the TupleTree object .
The TupleTree implements two methods insert and find .
The insert method takes a tuple and a key as parameters .
It inserts the tuple and stores a key at the location of the tuple .
The find method takes a tuple and returns a key if it was inserted at the location of the tuple .
class TupleTree ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
branches = { } self .
key =
None self .
all =
None def insert ( self , args , value ) : if len ( args ) == 0 : self .
key = value return first = args [ 0 ] if first == ALL : for node in self .
branches .
values ( ) : node . insert ( args [ 1 : ] , value ) self .
all = ( args [ 1 : ] , value ) elif first in self .
branches : node = self .
branches [ first ] node .
insert ( args [ 1 : ] , value ) if self .
all : node .
insert ( * self . all ) else : tree = TupleTree ( ) self .
branches [ first ] = tree tree .
insert ( args [ 1 : ] , value ) if self .
all : node .
insert ( * self .
all ) def find ( self , args ) : first = args [ 0 ] if first in self .
branches : node = self .
branches [ first ] elif ANY in self .
branches : node = self .
branches [ ANY ] if len ( args ) == 1 : return node .
key else : return node .
find ( args [ 1 : ] )
The Dispatcher
It is easy to define a dispatcher that matches argument tuples against a tuple in a TupleTree .
Handler functions which are decorated by a Dispatcher object are stored as tuple tree keys .
Those handler functions are retrieved from the TupleTree when the apply method is called with concrete arguments .
class Dispatcher ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
ttree = TupleTree ( ) def __call__ ( self , * args ) : def handler ( f ) : self .
ttree .
insert ( args , f ) return f return handler def apply ( self , * args ) : handler = self .
ttree .
find ( args ) if not handler : raise ValueError ( " Failed to find handler that matches arguments " ) else : return handler ( * args )
Example
As an example we create a new Dispatcher object and decorate handler functions using it .
alt = Dispatcher ( ) @ alt ( " / " , ANY ) def not_a_resource ( path , method ) : print " not a resource " @ alt ( ANY , " GET " ) def retrieve_resource ( path , method ) : print " retrieve resource " @ alt ( ANY , " POST " ) def update_resource ( path , method ) : print " update resource " , path @ alt ( ALL , " PUT " ) def create_new_resource ( path , method ) : print " create new resource " , path @ alt ( ANY , ANY ) def invalid_request ( path , method ) : print " invalid request " , path
Notice that the create_new_resource handler is called when the HTTP command is PUT is passed even when the path is the root path “ / ” .
This is caused by the ALL pattern in the first argument .
For all other commands a “ not a resource ” message is printed .
>>> alt.apply ( " / home " , " PUT " ) create new resource / home >>> alt.apply ( " / " , " PUT " ) create new resource / >>> alt.apply ( " / " , " GET " ) not a resource >>> alt.apply ( " / home " , " GET " ) retrieve resource / home >>> alt.apply ( " / home " , " PAUSE " ) invalid request PAUSE

Der Chaos Computer Club ( CCC ) will in der Debatte über Webseiten - Sperrungen unter dem Aufhänger der Bekämpfung von Kinderpornographie die Flinte noch nicht ins Korn werfen .
Parallel zum Ausarbeiten technischer Gegenstrategien soll den Bundestagsabgeordneten ein Ausweg aus dem Gesetzesvorhaben geboten werden , mit dem die Politiker " ihr Gesicht wahren können " , erklärte CCC - Sprecher Andy Müller - Maguhn zum Abschluss der dreitägigen Hackerkonferenz SIGINT in Köln am gestrigen Sonntagabend gegenüber heise online .
Die Volksvertreter sollen demnach ein verschärftes Vorgehen gegen die Betreiber kinderpornographischer Seiten und die strengere Strafverfolgung der eigentlichen Täter beschließen und im Gegenzug den heftig umkämpften Gesetzesentwurf beerdigen .
" Es hilft nichts , Sichtblockaden gegen Kinderpornographie im Internet aufzustellen " , fasste Müller - Maguhn den Tenor der vorausgegangenen Diskussionen zusammen .
Stattdessen müsse das Problem direkt an der Wurzel bekämpft werden .
Um die gefürchtete unheilvolle " Einmischung der Politik in das Internet " durch das Aufsetzen einer beliebig verwendbaren Zensurinfrastruktur noch zu verhindern , habe der CCC daher seine " Hemmschwelle " überwunden und werde nun das Gespräch mit den Parteien im Umfeld der parlamentarischen Beratung des entsprechenden Regierungsentwurfs suchen .
Die Abgeordneten müssten sich schließlich an der Lösung von Sachfragen messen lassen , nicht an der Beförderung symbolischer Politik .
Auf der SIGINT selbst trugen viele der 555 Besucher als sichtbares Zeichen des Protests schwarze T - Shirts mit dem Abbild von Bundesfamilienministerin Ursula von der Leyen und der Überschrift " Zensursula " , da die CDU - Politikerin den Stein der Web - Blockaden unter enormen Kraftanstrengungen ins Rollen gebracht hatte .
Ziel des kleinen Ablegers des jährlich zwischen den Jahren in Berlin stattfindenden Chaos Communication Congress war es gewesen , " dass Techniker mit Kulturschaffenden reden und mit Politikern " , wie Mario Manno vom CCC bei der Abschlussveranstaltung sagte .
Es sei darum gegangen , Meinungen zu verbreiten oder zumindest eine gemeinsame Wahrnehmung der
Welt zu entwickeln einschließlich von Punkten , " wo es brennt " .
Von Politikern selbst hatten sich die Hacker etwa für ein Podium über Computerspiele aber Absagen eingehandelt und auch das Publikum konnte letztlich zur abgeordnetenfreien Zone erklärt werden .
Zugesagt hatte aus der Konzernwelt dagegen ein Vertreter Googles für ein Datenschutz - Panel , erschien dann aber doch nicht .
Insgesamt wartete die erstmals vom CCC veranstaltete Tagung mit 90 Stunden Programm auf .
Manno sprach daher vom " größten Hacker - Event in NRW " , bei dem drei Paletten der bei den Freunden der schöpferisch - kritischen Auseinandersetzung mit der Technik besonders beliebten koffeinreichen Brause Club Mate sowie 450 der mit eben diesem Gebräu angereicherten Cocktails in Form von " Tschunks " bis sechs
Uhr morgens getrunken worden seien .
Darüber hinaus hätten die Hacker einen Aufzug in den Defekt getrieben , einen Beinahe - Brand verursacht und eine GSM - Empfangsbasis von Siemens " zerlegt " .
Trotz einer gut und weitgehend symmetrisch genutzten 155 MBit / s - Anbindung gab es zugleich im Unterschied zu den Berliner Chaos - Kongressen keine einzige verunstaltete oder verschönerte Webseite zu vermelden .
Für Manno ist so insgesamt klar , dass " wir mit der Hackerbewegung ein bisschen im Mainstream angekommen sind " .
Dabei zog er sogar eine Parallele zu der sonst von den Datenreisenden wenig geliebten Musikindustrie , da auch dahinter letztlich " Jugendliche mit der Gitarre " stünden , die " Werte und Ziele haben " .
Bei einer Umfrage im Publikum zu alternativen Vergütungsmodellen für Kreative hatten sich rund 99 Prozent der Anwesenden bereit erklärt , für eine " Kulturflatrate " zur rechtlichen Freigabe von Downloads aus Tauschbörsen eine Pauschale von fünf Euro pro Monat zu zahlen .
Musiker und die Macher von Indie - Labels hatten dagegen Bedenken vor allem wegen der ihrer Ansicht nach kaum gerecht hinzubekommenden Verteilung der Einnahmen und plädierten eher für die Vorfinanzierung von Werken über die Nutzer etwa durch die Ausgabe von " Aktien " , wie es die Kölner Band Angelika Express vorexerziert hat .

Stopping the pirates of Somalia has n't been easy .
But when the navies of the world have repelled or killed the hijackers , it 's often involved three elements : helicopters , drones and trained snipers .
The U.S. Army is working on a weapon which combines all three .
It 's called the Autonomous Rotorcraft Sniper System .
It mounts a powerful rifle onto highly stabilized turret , and fixes the package on board a Vigilante unmanned helicopter .
I describe the system in this month 's Popular Mechanics .
The system is intended for the urban battlefield — an eye in the sky that can stare down concrete canyons , and blink out targets with extreme precision .
Attempting to return fire against the ARSS is liable to be a near - suicidal act : ARSS is described as being able to fire seven to 10 aimed shots per minute , and it 's unlikely to miss .
Recent events off Somalia , however , may have suggested other uses for this technology .
Last week 's standoff between pirates and the
U.S. Navy in the Indian Ocean ended famously with three sniper shots , as a drone watched overhead .
In 2008 , French special forces captured six pirates on land after ransom had been paid .
" There were four helicopters involved , " The Independent
reported at the time .
" A sniper [ in a Puma helicopter ] shot out the motor of the pirates ' four - wheel drive vehicle .
A second helicopter [ a
Gazelle ] then landed nearby , allowing the six pirates to be arrested " — without any casualties .
The U.S. Coast Guard 's Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron ( HITRON ) uses helicopter - borne snipersto take out drug - running boats .
They are accurate enough to knock out engines without harming the crew or damaging fuel tanks .
" The driver just threw his hands up , " concludes the description of one such actionin * Men 's Vogue , * after all three engines were disabled with three shots .
And because the Vigilante is smaller , lighter and cheaper than a manned combat helicopter , it can be supplied in greater numbers , and without the need for those elite , highly - trained snipers .
Sniping from a chopper currently takes tons of skill and training .
But ARSS is literally point - and - shoot for the operator on the ground , using a videogame - type controller .
The software makes all the necessary corrections , and the system should ensure first - round kills at several hundred yards .
The secret is in the control system and stabilized turret ( on the right in the picture above ) , which is currently fitted with a powerful RND Manufacturing Edge 2000 rifle specifically designed for sniping work , using the heavyweight .338 Lapua Magnumcartridge .
The stabilized turret could be fitted to a variety of other vehicles — including a a small blimp , or a fixed - wing unmanned plane , like the Predator .
Compared to the
Predator 's array of Hellfire missiles , the ARSS ' lone gun would be much less likely to hit civilians .
It would also give a far deeper magazine :
dozens of shots instead of a handful of missiles , and at a cost of around $ 4 per trigger pull rather than about $ 100,000 for a Hellfire .
But the turret does n't need such a big craft to carry it , as the complete turret assembly weighs less than a single Hellfire .
The name needs changing .
But the Autonomous Rotorcraft Sniper System looks like it may have a big future — maybe on land , or maybe at sea .

It 's odd enough that a Bedford father would actually call police after arguing with his son about cleaning his room .
Stranger still , the sloppy son is 28 years old and serves on the Bedford school board .
" I know this looks bad , " said school board member Andrew Mizsak , who lives with his parents and works as a political consultant .
His mother , Paula , is a Bedford councilwoman .
Mizsak 's dad , also named Andrew , called 9 - 1 - 1 on Thursday after his son threw a plate of food across the kitchen table and balled his fist up at his dad when told to clean his room .
The senior Mizsak would n't press charges and told police , " I do n't want to ruin his political career . "
According to the report , he said : " Andrew is 270 pounds and he can't fight him , that they do everything for Andrew and he does n't even pay rent . "
The elder Mizsak said Saturday , " I overreacted .
No big deal . "
According to the report , " Andrew was sent to his room to clean it .
He was crying uncontrollably and stated he would comply . "
Mizsak said he was embarrassed to take police away from more important work .
" My dad and I love each other very much , " he said , promising to keep his basement room clean .
" I 'm lucky to be living in their house .
" Still waiting for her key
Elizabeth Warner Thomas , everybody just calls her Betsy , earned admittance to Phi Betta Kappa , the nation 's oldest academic honor society , at the College of Wooster in 1945 .
But she never got the key that students receive upon membership because the shipment did n't arrive as expected .
" They said they would mail it to us in the near future , " said Thomas .
She 's 87 and still does n't have the key .
So much for " near future . "
Thomas , who now lives in Oberlin after spending many years in Grafton , finally got recognition last week for her achievement when she was the keynote speaker at the induction of this year 's Phi Beta Kappa class at Wooster .
Her son , Dr. Roy Thomas , an ophthalmologist in Elyria ( one of three doctor sons of Betsy and her physician husband , Robert Thomas ) , called the school to alert them to the decades - long oversight .
When they confirmed it , she was invited to campus .
She told the kids in her speech not to lose their sense of humor .
Like her energy ( she walks a mile a day ) and her smarts , she still has hers .
" The kicker is , I got down there and they still did n't have my key , " she said .
" They had a form to fill out and send away and you could get it as a ring or on a chain .
And you get to pay for it ! "
She chose a $ 25 key on a chain she 'll wear around her neck .
She jokes about checking the mailbox daily and about how she 's so lucky to have her health and her wits .
Really , that 's the key .
Catch and eat
The Cleveland Metroparks
Zoo gave us a chuckle when it used an unusual twist on a common phrase to advertise the return of its Dinosaur exhibit this summer : " Lions and Tigers and Bears .
Yum . Yum . "
Meat and greet
Michael Symon 's celebrity was the sizzle as he served as official greeter in the VIP Martini Lounge Thursday for a big Arthritis Foundation fundraiser .
But Symon was as interested in the steak as the sizzle .
Or , rather , the beef cheek pierogi .
Symon frequently excused himself from greeting duties to join his crew preparing the signature , gourmet pierogi dish , one of many served by the 30 restaurants participating in Cleveland Magazine 's Silver Spoon Awards Party .
Cooking , plating and greeting the VIPs ?
That 's easy for an Iron Chef .
The event raised nearly $ 134,000 for the Northeast Ohio chapter of the Arthritis Foundation .
Enjoy the beans
Sometimes , a sponsor provides the perfect name for an event .
As planning continues for the annual " Taste of Cleveland " event in September , please allow Tipoff to thank the sponsor for the spontaneous smile and chuckle : " The Ohio Natural Gas Taste of Cleveland . "
With a name like that , do any of the food vendors stand a chance against the chili ?
Fond rememberance
Ohio State University researchers have concluded that Americans , particularly women , have become more biased toward youthful appearance .
They gleaned this by reading the obituary pages of The Plain Dealer , which showed that the photos appearing with 36 percent of people who died were taken at least 15 years before the person died .
In 1967 , it was only 16 percent .
And women were more than twice as likely as men to have an obituary photo from when they were much younger , according to the report , which appears in the current issue of Omega - Journal of Death and Dying .
" Our findings suggest that we were less accepting of aging in the 1990s than we were back in the 60s , " concluded researchers , who noted family members prefer photos showing their loved ones at their best , which usually meant younger .
" Ageism seems to be increasing over time , despite our growing awareness of the issue . "
Then again , were n't there simply fewer cameras around before 1952 , the cutoff for " young " photos for the 1967 obituaries .
A fine apology
The Washington Post ran a story Monday about a woman who returned a book 31 years overdue to the Arlington Public Library .
At Washington and Lee University recently , a book checked out by a Union soldier in 1864 - yes , that 's 1864 - was returned to its library .
After being passed down through generations , the first volume of W.F.P.
Napier 's four - volume set , History of the War in the Peninsula and in the South of France , was returned to the library , the school said , after an absence of 52,858 days .
( Which makes Tipoff feel far less guilty about the book we 've held hostage for a month or so . )
The guy who gave it back did so only if they waived the customary dollar - a - day fine .
The folks at the Cleveland Public Library got a kick out of the stories and posted a couple of unusual tidbits on itsWeb site .
In 1995 , someone mailed in a picture of Greta Garbo , torn from a library copy of a magazine eight years previous , with an apology note saying it had been stolen " when I was young and stupid . "
Then there was another note apologizing for having misplaced a book for more than a decade .
Not wanting to be slapped with a fine , the note read : P.S. The return address is fictitious .
Sarah Crump , John Luttermoser and Grant Segall contributed .

Marriage equality is gaining momentum across America .
On Friday , the Iowa Supreme Court -- by a unanimous ruling -- made marriage equality the law of the land .
Then the Vermont legislature overturned their Governor 's veto of a marriage equality bill by a two - thirds margin on Tuesday .
And now the religious right is responding with a national TV ad filled with fear about a same - sex marriage " storm " gathering across the country .
This morning , the " National Organization for Marriage " launched a disturbing ad using actors to push lies claiming that marriage equality threatens personal freedoms .
The ad is going up on the airwaves across America as NOM seeks to build what they are calling a " rainbow coalition " against equality .
We need your help to fight back right now against this deplorable ad .
With many legal experts expecting the California Supreme Court to uphold Prop 8 , our only option will be to place an initiative on the ballot to restore marriage equality .
To repeal Prop 8 , we will need to build a grassroots army for change in every county of California .
In response , the Dolby Family is challenging the Courage Campaign to raise $ 25,000 as a matching grant to fund Camp Courage trainings for marriage equality activists .
While NOM 's TV ad uses actors to portray false victims , Camp Courage is mobilizing real people to speak from their heart , door - to - door across California .
Modeled on the " Camp Obama " training events that helped propel President Obama into the White House , Camp Courage uses the " Story of Self " to transform personal experiences -- each participant 's unique inspiration for supporting marriage equality -- into compelling and authentic narratives that can persuade undecided voters .
Can you help us respond to these lies and distortions by turning fear into hope ?
Watch this despicable TV ad now and then contribute to support more Camp Courage trainings by helping us meet this generous $ 25,000 matching grant from the Dolby Family -- thus doubling their amazing donation .
( full - disclosure : I work for the Courage Campaign )
I ’ll take money from anyone .
For years , I wrote articles for a magazine put out by Marlboro that was so insidious it was about healthy outdoor living and did n’t allow me to mention smoking .
I ’ve written for Playboy .
For all of college , I even took money from my parents .
And I ’ve heard that this newspaper is largely owned by Sam Zell .
But when the Anti-Defamation League , a Jewish charity , offered me $ 500 to speak at a fundraiser in Las Vegas , I did not take their money .
First of all , as anyone who has read my columns knows , I am clearly pro-defamation .
Also , although I do n’t think Jews believe in hell , I think they would create one for someone who took money from a charity to speak at a fundraiser .
So , although I did not take the cash , I ’m pretty sure I cost them far more than $ 500 when I mentioned in my speech that I had just had Al Jazeera come to my house to interview me .
Once you do enough E ! shows , you really can’t justify turning anyone down .
I ca n’t wait to see “ The 101 Hottest Jews Who Control the Media . ”

When I talked to the people who ran the Vegas charity , they informed me that almost everyone accepts the money .
In fact , sometimes people who host events in their home charge the charity for their costs .
I was expecting them to tell me that the people who receive charity charge to deposit the checks .
At first I feared this was another bad Madoff - type moment for the Jews .
Then I made some calls and found out that nearly every charity pays celebrities to host their events .
A church in my wife ’s tiny hometown of Hoosick Falls , N.Y. , has paid several older actresses to show up at fundraisers .
I was shocked , partly because famous people got paid to help others , and partly because people give more to their church if people who were in “ Dynasty ” were there .
Thanks to a 2003 scandal involving an events promoter , we found out that Ray Charles , Gerald Ford , Bill Cosby , Natalie Cole and Paul Anka received tens of thousands of dollars for appearing at charity events .
And it has n’t slowed down .
I called a few charities and quickly got a dozen names of celebrities , some of whom had recently scored $ 10,000 or more for showing up at fundraisers .
At least one even demanded that his introduction make it sound like he was doing it for free .
I briefly considered having my intro say I was paid $ 100,000 , to make me look a lot more important .
I may listen to too much rap music .
When I called the celebrities ’ publicists , most did n’t call me back .
Others said they had no record of the events .
Except Joan Rivers .

Rivers , who gives a lot of her money and time to her personal charities -- God ’s Love We Deliver , Guide Dogs for the Blind , and Melissa Rivers -- thought I was an idiot for not knowing that this is how the fundraising circuit works .
“ It ’s all very nice to do it for free , and then my accountant calls me and says , ‘ You ca n’t go to Connecticut this year , you have to rent it , ’ ” she said .
“ I always give a ‘ charity deduction , ’ because you feel so guilty .
But you have to say , ‘ If they did n’t have me , they would n’t have filled the room . ’ ” She also told me that if you write a bestseller , you can get in on this action straight away .
Rivers is not wrong .
I understand that paying stars can be a net gain for a charity .
And I understand that lots of celebrities have their own causes they work for , for free .
And I understand that the whole point of this column is to subtly lump me in with celebrities .
But I still think it ’s not fair for speakers to get both money and the goodwill of people who assume they showed up for free .
It ’s wrong to advocate a cause and then suck money out of it .
In fact , any of those words in any order is wrong .

So more charities are going to have to shame celebrities who ask for money .
Copy the canceled checks .
Post ‘em on smokinggun.com .
Give them to a reporter so he or she can write about it .
Although , by now , we ’re desperate enough to try to cash them instead .
Doing this might mean fewer celebrities will show up , but I bet most of them will still do the events , and maybe for free , or at least with a hefty discount .
Like Rivers , for instance , who is doing an event for the United Jewish Appeal this week .
And she donates her paintings and items from her jewelry line to silent auctions .
“ I do n’t know how many poor people have a Joan Rivers painting from a silent auction , ” she told me .
The problem is n’t greed , it ’s what we ’ve all decided is acceptable .
Though I sure am glad the ADL did n’t offer me $ 5,000 .

Dhani Harrison talks up the Beatles ’ “ Rock Band ”
Dhani Harrison…yes , you may know him as George ’s son…has been making the press rounds , talking up You Are Here , the album by his band , thenewno2 .
While doing so , however , it has n’t exactly required a great deal of arm - twisting to get him to chat about how he had more than a little bit to do with the folks at Apple Corps agreeing to license the Beatles ’ music for their very own volume of “ Rock Band . ”
But that ’s fair enough , since “ Yomp , ” a song by thenewno2 , was released as downloadable content for “ Rock Band ” on July 29 , 2008 , and another track , “ Crazy Tuesday , ” was released as one of 20 free songs for “ Rock Band 2 . ”
“ I basically did that for Apple , ” admitted Harrison , “ so that they could see it and say , ‘ Oh , look , there ’s Dhani , he ’s a new media kind of person , and this is how he ’s selling his stuff .
Maybe we should consider doing that with the Beatles , seeing as we do n’t have any digital deal or anything . ' ”
The Beatles ’ “ Rock Band ” evolved out of several meetings Harrison had with Alex Rigopulos , co-founder of Harmonix Music Systems , the developers of “ Rock Band . ”
“ He ’s a genius , ” said Harrison , “ just the loveliest , loveliest guy .
We were sitting around one day , and he just said to me , ‘ Do you think they would ever go for a Beatle game ? ’
And I was thinking the same thing to talk to him about !
‘ It would be amazing , would n’t it ? ’
I said to him .
Actually , I think I said , ‘ It would be amazing because I could kick your ass at ‘ I Am the Walrus ’ while dressed as a wizard in Shea Stadium . ’
“ Do you know what I mean ?
Or I could put on the ice skating outfit from ‘ Help ! ’ and then beat you at ‘ Tomorrow Never Knows ’ in the universe somewhere .
I do n’t know .
Just make up whatever you can ; ‘ I Am the Walrus ’ at the Cavern Club , even .
Would n’t that be fun ?
And we both just started riffing on that kind of stuff until we both just were in hysterics , and it was obviously a brilliant idea , but I said , ‘ Well , that ’s never going to happen , is it ? ’
And he said , ‘ No , it ’s never going to happen . ’
I said , ‘ But I should talk to the guys from Apple , anyway .
Because it is actually a no - brainer .
It is the biggest no - brainer that I ’ve ever , ever thought about , and if Apple do n’t go for it , then they are shooting themselves in the foot , because someone else is going to do it .
Someone else is going to get their own game .
“ In the way the media works these days , in the way that music delivery systems work these days , I find it quite often best to be first , ” Harrison explained .
“ If you were the first person ever to design an application for the iPhone and you patented it , you would be very , very better off than we are right now , you know ?
But you ’ve got to be the first one to do it .
So I figured that Led Zeppelin or The Stones were going to do it unless we just got on to it .
So I got cracking with the guys from Apple .
I kind of almost bullied them into believing how amazing it was .
They really did n’t need much convincing if you looked to the fourth quarter , the month of December 2007 , I think they sold something like 10,000,000 units of ‘ Guitar Hero 2 ’ in just one month , and they are $ 50.00 each .
I said , ‘ If you do the math , if you go 50/50 with ‘ Rock Band ’ and you sell a Beatles ‘ Rock Band ’ game , that ’s a big deal ’ you know .
And not to mention that , once the game is made , you can just keep adding songs to it .
You could do the Bangladesh pack , you could do the ‘ Live and Let Die ’ pack , you could do the ‘ Imagine ’ pack … ”
Are you salivating yet ?
Better clean yourself up .
You ’ve got ’ til September 9th until the Beatles ’ “ Rock Band ” hits stores .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists said on Thursday they had shown the human body regenerates heart cells at a rate of about one percent a year , a discovery that could one day reduce the need for transplants .

The study of 50 volunteers , using a dating method that detects traces of a carbon isotope left by Cold War nuclear bomb tests , raises the prospect of artificially stimulating the renewal process some day , they reported in the journal Science .
“ It would be a way to try and help the heart to some self - help rather than transplanting new cells , ” Jonas Frisen of Sweden ’s Karolinska Institute said in a telephone interview .
“ Taking advantage of the heart ’s own capacity to generate new cells either using pharmaceutical compounds or , if it is possible , by exercise or any other environmental factor . ”
Heart cells are unusual in that they stop dividing early in life .
Doctors knew there were master cells called stem cells in the heart , but heart muscle usually simply forms scar tissue after damage and never fully regenerates .
In their four - year study , Frisen and colleagues employed an ingenious method to find out whether there is any regeneration at all .
“ The DNA of all plant and animal cells incorporated high concentrations of carbon - 14 released into the atmosphere by above - ground nuclear testing during the Cold War , and this unfortunate episode provides a unique opportunity to test cell population dynamics in human tissues , ” Charles Murry of the University of Washington and Richard Lee of Harvard Medical School wrote in a commentary .
Carbon - 14 dating showed that overall , the hearts of their 50 volunteers were “ younger ” than the patients ’ ages .
Frisen said the rate at which the new cells are produced slows as we get older , with a young adult in their twenties renewing cells at a rate of about 1 percent a year , falling to half a percent a year by the age of 75 .
“ If you exchange cells at this rate it means that even if you live a very long life you will not have exchanged more than 50 percent of your cells , ” said Frisen .
“ So at any given time your heart is a mosaic of cells you carry with you from birth and cells that that have been added later to replace cells that have been lost during life . ”
The finding could also help scientists determine whether some people are predisposed to heart disease , by looking at the heart ’s ability to renew cells .
“ We are interested in studying whether some heart diseases could potentially be caused by too low an ability to replace heart cells , ” Frisen added .
Secretive U.S. Prison Units Used to House Muslim , Animal Rights and Environmental Activists
Welcome to everyone visiting from Democracy Now , Digg , BoingBoing , Reddit and elsewhere !
After you read this article , you can learn more about the Green Scare , and other attacks on civil liberties in the name of fighting “ terrorism . ”
Thank you !
The government is using secretive prison facilities on U.S. soil , called Communication Management Units , to house inmates accused of being tied to â€œterrorismâ€ groups .
They overwhelmingly include Muslim inmates , along with at least two animal rights and environmental activists .
Little information is available about the secretive facilities and the prisoners housed there .
However , through interviews with attorneys , family members , and a current prisoner , it is clear that these units have been created not for violent and dangerous â€œterrorists , â€  but for political cases that the government would like to keep out of the public spotlight and out of the press .
OPENED QUIETLY AND PERHAPS ILLEGALLY
In April of 2006 , the Department of Justice proposed a new set of rules to restrict the communication of â€œterroristâ€ inmates .
The proposal did not make it far , though : during the required public comment period , the ACLU and other civil rights groups raised Constitutional concerns .
The program was too sweeping , they said , and it could wrap up non-terrorists and those not even convicted of a crime .
The Bureau of Prisons dropped the proposal .
Or so it seemed .
Just a few months later , a similar program ( now called the Communication Management Unit , or CMU ) , was quietly opened by the Justice Department at Terre Haute , Ind .
Then , in May of 2008 , a handful of inmates were moved , without warning , to what is believed to be the second CMU in the country , at Marion , Il .
Both CMUs are â€œself - containedâ€  housing units , according to prison documents , for prisoners who â€œrequire increased monitoring of communicationâ€ in order to â€œprotect the public.â€ 
WHO IS HOUSED AT CMUs ?
The CMUs are distinct from other ultra-restrictive prisons like ADX Florence , the notorious supermax prison for the most dangerous inmates .
The supermax holds al - Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui and Unabomber Theodore J. Kaczynski .
CMU inmates stand in sharp contrast to the Moussaouis and Kaczynskis of the world , though .
They include Rafil A. Dhafir , an Iraqi - born physician who created a charity called Help the Needy to provide food and medicine to the people of Iraq suffering under the U.S. - imposed economic sanctions .
He was sentenced to 22 years in prison for violating the sanctions .

He was sentenced to 22 years in prison for violating the sanctions .
They include Daniel McGowan , an environmental activist sentenced to seven years in prison for a string of property crimes in the name of defending the environment .
He was previously at FCI - Sandstone , a low - security facility , and was transferred without notice to the CMU , and told it was not for any disciplinary reason .

He was previously at FCI - Sandstone , a low - security facility , and was transferred without notice to the CMU , and told it was not for any disciplinary reason .
And , until recently , they included Andrew Stepanian .
Stepanian was convicted of conspiring to commit â€œanimal enterprise terrorismâ€ and shut down the notorious animal testing laboratory Huntingdon Life Sciences , in a landmark First Amendment case pending appeal .
The government ’s case focused on a controversial website run by an activist group that published news of both legal and illegal actions against the laboratory .
He was sentenced to three years in prison , and is currently on house arrest in New York City .
Stepanian is believed to be the first prisoner ever released from a CMU .
VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS RIGHTS
Attorneys and prisoners have said that inmates are transferred to the CMUs without notice and without opportunity to challenge their new designation , in what seems to be a clear violation of their due process rights .
“ No one got a hearing to determine whether we should or should not be transferred here , ” said Daniel McGowan in a letter from the CMU in Marion , Ill .
Similarly , Rafil A. Dhafir said in a letter to his family from the CMU in Terre Haute , Ind. , that he was put in isolation for two days before the move .
“ No one seems to know about this top - secret operation until now , ” he wrote .
“ It is still not fully understood …
The staff here is struggling to make sense of the whole situation . ”
â€ œWe are told this is an experiment , â€  Dhafir says .
â€
œSo the whole concept is evolving on a daily basis.â€ 
OUT OF SIGHT , OUT OF MIND
The CMU â€ œexperimentâ€ limits prisoner contact with the outside world through a list of restrictive policies .
According to prison documents giving a skeleton of CMU policies , called institution supplements , they include :
Phone calls :
Only one phone call per week , limited to 15 minutes , live - monitored by staff and law enforcement ( according to attorneys , this includes the NSA ) and scheduled one and half weeks in advance .
It must be conducted in English .
Other prisoners get about 300 minutes a month .

Mail :
All mail must be reviewed by staff prior to delivery to the inmate or processing at the post office .
This means significant delays in communications ( and , in my personal experience , letters frequently not being received by inmates ) .

This means significant delays in communications ( and , in my personal experience , letters frequently not being received by inmates ) .
Visits :
Four hours of personal visits per month , non-contact , behind glass , and live - monitored by staff and law enforcement .
It must be conducted in English .
By comparison , at FCI Sandstone ( where McGowan was previously housed ) prisoners can receive 56 potential visiting hours per month .
I have learned from attorneys and prisoners that when a CMU inmate is transferred to the visiting room , the entire facility goes on lock - down .
For many inmates in federal prisons , phone calls , mail and visits are flecks of light in the darkness .
Virtually eliminating all contact with family , friends and the outside world can have a devastating psychological impact on prisoners , and raises serious concerns about basic human rights .
WHY ARE THEY THERE ?
It is difficult to discern the rationale behind why some inmates are transferred to the CMU and others are not .
For instance , John Walker Lindh , the â€œAmerican Taliban , â€ is housed at the CMU in Terre Haute .
He pleaded guilty to supporting the Taliban and carrying a rifle and grenades on the battlefield in Afghanistan .
However , the government announced last month it is actually easing restrictions on his communication .
In the case of Andy Stepanian , he was one of six codefendants , and by the admission of prosecutors he was one of the minor players in the case .
He is not accused of any violent crime or any property destruction , and had no disciplinary problems while incarcerated .
Stepanian received the second - lowest sentence of the group , and his codefendants are not in CMUs .
Daniel McGowanâ€™s notice of transfer to the CMU gives some indication of the governmentâ€™s reasoning .
It says that he has been identified â€œas a member and leader in the Earth Liberation Front ( ELF ) and Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) , groups considered domestic terrorist organizations.â€ 
But in a letter from the CMU , McGowan wrote : “ It ’s funny – I have like 13 codefs [ codefendants ] + there are 11 other eco prisoners and I end up here . ”
Part of the explanation for his transfer to the CMU , it seems , is that he is a vocal , prominent activist with a large group of active supporters .
For McGowan , his near celebrity status within the environmental movement , along with his continued activism , has become a liability .
When I attended his sentencing hearing in Eugene , Ore. , in 2006 , the judge made a point of criticizing his media appearances and his website , SupportDaniel.org .
Attorneys , prisoners and their supporters speculate there may be legal calculations involved as well .
The CMUs have been overwhelmingly comprised of people of color since their inception , and lawsuits have been filed alleging discrimination and racial profiling .
â€ œThrowing a few white kids into the mix makes it appear less like an American Guantanamo , â€ said one attorney who did not want to be identified .
â€ œAnd it also sends the message to the prisoners and to the movements that supporter them .
Itâ€™s meant to have a chilling effect.â€ 
CONTINUING A TREND
The creation of secret facilities to primarily house Muslim inmates accused of non-violent charges , along with a couple animal rights and environmental activists , marks both a continuation and a radical expansion of the â€œWar on Terrorism.â€ 
First , it is a continuation of the â€œterrorismâ€ crackdown that Arab and Muslim communities have intensely experienced since September 11th .
Guantanamo Bay may be closing .
But as Jeanne Theoharis beautifully wrote recently : “ GuantÃ¡namo is not simply an aberration ; its closure will not return America to the rule of law or to its former standing among nations .
GuantÃ¡namo is a particular way of seeing the Constitution , of constructing the landscape as a murky terrain of lurking enemies where the courts become part of the bulwark against such dangers , where rights have limits and where international standards must be weighed against national security .â€ 
Second , it is an expansion of the lesser - known â€œterrorismâ€ crackdown against animal rights and environmental activists by corporations and the politicians who represent them .
This coordination campaign to label activists as â€œterroristsâ€ and push a political agendaâ € ” the â€ œGreen Scareâ€â € ” has involved terrorism enhancement penalties , FBI agents infiltrating vegan potlucks , and new terrorism legislation like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act , and it all has proceeded unobstructed and unseen .
There has been a near - complete media blackout on the Green Scare , and transferring vocal , public Green Scare prisoners to CMUs sends a clear message that the government hopes to keep it that way .
â€ œSECOND-TIER TERRORISTSâ€
When the CMU at Terre Haute was created , Dan Eggen at The Washington Post described it as a facility for â€œsecond - tier terrorism inmates.â€ 
What Eggen was clearly getting at is that the CMU overwhelmingly held Arab Muslim inmates rounded up and smeared by the government as â€œterrorists , â€ even though they had not done anything violent or “ terrorist . ”
But the CMUs are not â€œsecond - tier terrorismâ€ prisons .
They are political prisons .
All of the defendantsâ€ ” Muslim , environmentalist , animal rights activistâ€ ” are housed there because of their ethnicity , their religion , their ideology , or all of the above .
The mere existence of the CMUs should be yet another warning call to all Americans concerned about the future of this country .
If we allow the government to continue widening the net of who is a â€œterrorist , â€ and expanding the scope of what punishments are applicable ( and what rights are inapplicable ) when that word comes into play , it places us all at risk .
The reckless expansion of the War on Terrorism didnâ€™t stop with Arabs and Muslims , and it wonâ€™t stop with environmentalists or animal rights activists .
The power to create and maintain secretive prison facilities for political prisoners is antithetical to a healthy democracy .
If there is one thing that we should learn from history , from governments that have gone down this path , it is this :
If there is a secretive prison for â€œsecond - tierâ€ terrorists , it will only be followed by a secretive prison â€œthird - tier terrorists , â€ and “ fourth - tier terrorists , ” until one by one , brick by brick , the legal wall separating “ terrorist ” from “ dissident ” or “ undesirable ” has crumbled .

In a recent update for L4D on the PC , we provided the option for players to choose between starting a game on an Official server or the Best Available .
This is just the first step in giving players control over what servers they play on and the type of experience they have .
This is part of the L4D SDK rollout , which is currently in a closed beta and will be released shortly after the launch of the L4D Survival Pack .
To support the SDK , we are extending the matchmaking system to allow for third party campaigns .
We will be adding extra features so players will be able to find dedicated servers running the campaigns they have installed .
They will also be able to see friends playing third party campaigns , and be directed to download them as necessary .
Another major feature we are planning to add to the matchmaking system at a future date is team - based Versus matching .
This will allow two teams of four to locate each other and compete in a Versus match .
We are also revamping our player matching based on skill level .
Currently the system tries to match people with the same skill level and best pings together .
We will be revisiting this system to tweak it based on data we have collected .

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- " Slumdog Millionaire " leaves audiences uplifted .
But that is hardly how one of its child stars felt on Thursday .
Indian authorities demolished the home of " Slumdog Millionaire " child actor Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail .
Despite the hit movie 's mega-millions in box - office receipts , Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail 's life changed little after he returned home to Mumbai , India 's , Garib Nagar , or city of the poor .
On Thursday , even the roof over the real - life slum dweller 's head was taken away as Indian authorities tore down the shanty where Ismail 's family lived .
Authorities said the home and about 20 others around it were illegally built .
Senior Inspector Rahim Sheikh told CNN that the shanties were brought down as part of a municipal drive to clear encroachments on public land .
Bulldozers leveled the slum built on a municipal garden , said Sheikh , who is in charge of the locality in Mumbai where Ismail lived .
The little boy sat among twisted corrugated metal and other debris , surrounded by filth and squalor .
Memories of Hollywood 's glitz and glitter were distant as tears streamed down his face .
He said his family was given no notice of the demolition and did not have time to remove their belongings .
But , they said , they plan to return and rebuild .
Watch ' Slumdog ' actor 's home razed . »
" Slumdog Millionaire " is the story of Jamal , an impoverished , uneducated teen who competes on an Indian game show .
Ismail , who played a young Jamal 's brother , Salim , traveled to Los Angeles , California , in February for this year 's Academy Awards , where the movie won eight Oscars , including best picture .
CNN 's Sara Sidner contributed to this story .

SINGAPORE —
It is Singapore ’s secret Eden , a miniature village called Kampong Buangkok that is hidden in trees among the massed apartment blocks , where a fresh breeze rustles the coconut palms and tropical birds whoop and whistle .
With just 28 houses in an area the size of three football fields , it is Singapore ’s last rural hamlet , a forgotten straggler in the rush to modernize this high - rise , high - tech city - state .
But apparently not for much longer .
Kampong Buangkok is designated by the government for demolition and redevelopment , possibly in the near future .
When it is gone , one of the world ’s most extreme national makeovers will be complete .
Kampong is a local word for village and also defines a traditional rural way of life that Singapore has left behind .
“ The big overhaul began in the early 1960s , ” said Rodolph de Koninck , a professor of geography at the University of Montreal and one of the authors of “ Singapore : An Atlas of Perpetual Territorial Transformation , ” which graphically charts a half - century of change .
Claim :
The larva of a human botfly was removed from a child ’s eye .

Subject : Fw : Careful with dust !!!
Its just like from an alien movie be very careful when u get caught with dust … as following pics will show effects of bad dust to a person .
While he was walking he felt an eye irritation , thinking that it was just regualr dust , he started to rub his eye , in an effort to remove the dust ….
then his eyes got really red , and he went and bought some eye drops from a pharmacy …. few days passed n his eyes were still red and seems a little swollen .
Again he dismissed it as the constant rubbing and that it will go away .
The days go by the swelling of his eye got worse , redder and bigger ….
till he decided to go and see a doctor for a check up .
The doctor immediately wanted an operation , being afraid of a tumor growth or cyst .
At the operation , what was thought to be a growth or cyst , actually turned out to be a live worm ….. what was thought initially to be just mere dust actually was an insect ’s egg … … because of that , my friends , if u do get caught in dust , and the pain persists , pls go see a doctor immediately …… thank you ….
Origins : Tales of insects ; living and growing and nesting inside the human body prompt some of the most visceral responses of all the types of horror legends .
We can read about people being killed in all sorts of gruesome ways almost with equanimity , it seems , but the thought of creepy - crawlies inside our bodies sends shivers up and down our spines .
( Just think how repulsed most people are by the sight of maggots , even when they ’re feeding on flesh that ’s already
dead . )
And if bugs are going to turn our own corporeal residences into homes for themselves , they could scarcely choose a more revulsion - inducing site than an eyeball — the location of the most important and vulnerable of our senses .
Chilling as they are , the photos accompanying this item , at least , are real .
They were taken from a July 2000 article appearing in the Archives of Ophthalmology ( a journal published the American Medical Association ) that describes and illustrates the removal of a human botfly larva from the eye of a 5 - year - old by in Honduras by an Air Force mobile ophthalmic surgical team .
As summarized by the article :
A 5 - year - old boy with inferior orbital swelling and an erythematous mass arising from the inferior cul - de-sac of his right eye was seen by an Air Force Mobile Ophthalmic Surgical Team working in a rural area of the Republic of Honduras .
The respiratory pore of a late - stage larva of the human botfly ( Dermatobia hominis ) was located in the anterior orbit .
The larva was gently removed under general anesthesia through a small incision in the conjunctiva
Botflies ( such as the one featured in these photos , the human botfly , or Dermatobia hominis , commonly found from central Mexico through to Central America and South America ) are one of a number of insect species that lay their eggs on the exterior of other living creatures ( usually mosquitoes or flies ) ; when the eggs hatch , the larvae burrow into their “ hosts ” to feed ( breathing through the small burrow holes ) until they emerge to pupate into mature adult botflies .
Generally , a female botfly ’s choosing a human host for her young poses no great threat to the human , and the infestation can be eliminated via a simple surgical procedure , as the cited article notes :
Covering a larva ’s burrow hole with some type of ointment or fatty substance will generally remedy the problem ; if not , a simple surgical procedure
Also , as noted in the article , a botfly in the eye is far from a common occurrence , “ no previous case to our knowledge of orbital invasion hav[ing ] been reported . ”
Although the implication that some have taken from the Internet text accompanying this message — that getting “ bad dust ” in one ’s eye and rubbing the eye might somehow cause the type of problem shown here — is wrong , the gist of the message is correct : one should not dismiss a persistent swelling and itching of the eye as merely “ I ’ve got something in the eye ” ; it should be checked by a doctor as soon as possible .

Microsoft Bob
Version 1.00
You may have heard jokes about some old failed Microsoft product called " Bob " or seen that big yellow smily face wearing nerdy glasses , and wondered " what the heck was that all about ? " .
Well , in early 1995 Microsoft released a software program called " Bob " designed to replace the desktop of Windows 3.1 and 95 with an interface designed mainly for novice users .
Microsoft held a big advertising campaign and loaded up stores with copies of Bob expecting huge sales .
It totally flopped .
A few possible reasons that Bob flopped : Bob required a minimum of a 486 with 8 megs of ram , 30 megs of free disk space , and 256 color VGA .
Many computers of the day did not meet these minimum requirements .
It was too " cute " for the average PC users of the day .
Most people at the time who wanted ease of use would just get a Macintosh .
Bob was not useful enough to justify its initial sale price of almost $ 100 .
Windows 95 , which was released later that year , had the new Windows Explorer user interface which wiped the floor with Bob .
And so Microsoft Bob disappeared in to obscurity .
The Microsoft Bob splash screen .
There appear to be two releases of Bob .
These screen shots are of version 1.00 which has a time stamp of 1/30/1995 .
Then there is a second release , version " 1.00a " dated 8/14/95 , which included some additional guides , rooms , and objects .
Microsoft Bob can be run as a regular application or it can be set to start up automatically when the computer starts .
Before you can use Bob you must identify yourself .
Use the knocker and select from a list of Bob users .
If you are not in the list of users you must fill in some information to identify yourself .
( This information is used later by the Bob programs ) .
While users can can have " private " areas in Bob , there is no real security .
This is the " Public Family Room " that you start off in .
An interesting thing about Bob is that just about everything on the screen is drawn using vector graphics ( Windows meta files ) .
All objects can be resized to any size or stretched .
This allows rooms to render smoothly at any screen resolution .
One odd thing about the rendering , perhaps there is some reason , even on a display with millions of colors all graphics seem to be dithered to a 256 color palette .
Many of the objects in the room are just decoration , but some of them launch special applications that only work inside Bob .
The critter in the corner is " Rover " , your guide .
Ummmm .... " scrumptious " ?
Perhaps they should have named him " Fruit Loop " instead .
On a more technical note , the different guides insert different descriptive words in to many of the common dialogs .
This customizes the text to the " personality " of the selected guide .
" scrumptious " is one of Rover 's words .
You can select other guides , but Rover comes back at various times .

Planck mated with the Ariane 5 ECA launcher
29 April 2009
Move to the final assembly building
The BAF building is dedicated to final preparation of the launcher on the launch table , integration of the upper composite ( SYLDA 5 support structure and fairing ) , and assembly of the upper composite on top of the launcher .
The building is located about 10 km from the S5A building where the Planck fuelling operations were performed and about 2.6 km from the Ariane launch pad .
On Wednesday 22 April , late in the evening , the Planck spacecraft arrived at the BAF airlock .
After entering the airlock and ensuring cleanroom conditions inside , on the next morning the spacecraft was rolled out of the payload transport container ( Conteneur Charge Utile 3 , or CCU3 ) that was used to maintain a cleanroom environment during the transport from the S5A building .
In parallel to the spacecraft preparation activities during the launch campaign , the lower part of the Ariane 5 ECA launcher has also been assembled and prepared .
Now standing in the 90 m - high hall of the BAF building it is comprised of the main cryogenic core stage ( EPC ) and the two solid propellant boosters on opposite sides of the EPC .
On top of the EPC are the upper stage ( ESCA ) and finally the Vehicle Equipment Bay ( VEB ) .
A 0.78 m - high adapter cone , composed of a strong carbon structure and two aluminium rings , is integrated over the VEB to interface between the launcher and the Planck spacecraft .
Planck mating with launcher
The 47 m - high BAF airlock is adjacent to the BAF 's 90 m - high hall where launchers are mated with their payload and are finalised .
The airlock and the adjacent hall are connected by a wide shaft in the hall that at its base opens into the airlock .
In the morning on 23 April the Planck spacecraft was hoisted up inside the BAF airlock and through the shaft into the hall .
With the launcher adapter ring ( Adaptateur Charge Utile , or ACU ) already integrated at the base of Planck 's service module the spacecraft was lifted from the CCU3 pallet and hoisted up by an overhead crane , using the Planck vertical lifting device to handle the spacecraft .
Inside the hall the spacecraft was manoeuvred over the Ariane launcher .
It was then lowered in place and integrated with the launcher by personnel on the payload access platform ( Plate - Forme Charge Utile , or PFCU ) , which surrounds the launcher at the height of the VEB .
The ACU was bolted to the launcher 's adapter cone that is secured on the VEB .
The electrical connections between the launcher and the ACU were also set up and tested .
Final preparations were then performed on the Planck spacecraft before its encapsulation with the SYLDA 5 support structure that will carry the Herschel spacecraft during the joint launch .
These preparations included the last finalisation of the multi-layer insulation , the removal of all non-flight items such as protective covers , and a final visual inspection of the spacecraft .
The Planck spacecraft was also switched on for a final functional check after the mating with the launcher .
SYLDA 5 integration on launcher
The SYLDA 5 ( Système de Lancement Double Ariane ) is a support structure that can be used during joint launches on an Ariane 5 launcher to carry the upper part of the launcher 's payload , the second spacecraft .
It consists of a load bearing carbon structure that is comprised of a conical base fixed to the Vehicle Equipment Bay , a high cylindrical shell and an upper truncated conical shell .
On Monday 27 April the SYLDA 5 was hoisted up inside the BAF airlock and up into the 90 m - high hall by a crane that subsequently lowered it into place over the Planck spacecraft at the top of the launcher .
At its base the SYLDA 5 is almost as wide as the launcher , which has a diameter of 5.4 m , and it now encloses both the Planck spacecraft and the launcher adapter cone ( between the launcher and the spacecraft ) that is only 3.9 metres in diameter .
The base of the SYLDA 5 is bolted to the VEB .
After launch , at the required time , a pyrotechnical device running around the SYLDA 5 at the level of the conical / cylindrical lower interface will cut it in a horizontal plane .
Immediately after , springs will impart an impulse to jettison the SYLDA 5 away from the spacecraft .
After its installation on the Ariane 5 ECA launcher the SYLDA 5's electrical connections with the launcher were set up and verified .
To maintain the Planck spacecraft 's environment under the enclosing support structure a nitrogen flushing system has been connected to the SYLDA 5 , providing dry nitrogen atmosphere to Planck .
The next major milestone in the launch campaign will be the mating of the Herschel spacecraft on top of the SYLDA 5 .

CDC covered up high lead levels in D.C. Joe Byrne
Published : Saturday April 11 , 2009
Print This Email This Eight years ago , engineers and officials in Washington , D.C. decided to give the go - ahead for a program that would eliminate the " potentially carcinogenic by - products " of chlorine in tap water .
The program replaced chlorination with chloramination , and it worked .
However , in the next three years , hundreds of families with homes fitted with lead pipes in the District of Columbia were exposed to dangerously high lead levels .
Unknown to scientists at the time , the chlorine in tap water served as a ' binder ' for the lead pipes , keeping a certain amount of lead from dissolving in the water .
In 2004 , the chlorination method was restored .
Still , in the first half of that year , 74 out of 108 household taps sampled had lead concentrations above the " EPA action level , " some astronomically so .
Numerous studies confirm that very low levels of lead in blood are linked to short attention spans and reading problems in children .
In adults , low levels are linked to high blood pressure and an increased risk of death from heart disease and stroke .
If not detected early , children with high levels of lead in their bodies can suffer from brain and nervous system damage , stunted growth , and hearing problems .
An investigation by Rebecca Renner of Salon has revealed that the Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) had withheld evidence of dangerously high levels .
An influential CDC report released in 2004 ( and since cited by officials in Seattle to calm nervous parents ) downplayed the role that chloramination played in the D.C. lead crisis , saying that it " might have contributed a small increase in blood lead levels . "
However , according to Renner , " the results of thousands of blood tests that measured lead contamination in children were missing from the report , potentially skewing the findings and undermining public health .
Further , the CDC discovered in 2007 that many young children living in D.C. homes with lead pipes were poisoned by drinking water and suffered ill effects .
Parents wondered whether the water could have caused speech and balance problems , difficulty with learning , and hyperactivity .
Yet the health agency did not publicize the new findings or alert public health authorities in D.C. or other federal agencies that regulate lead , such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or Housing and Urban Development . "
The principle author of the 2004 CDC lead report , Mary Jean Brown , stands by her conclusion that exposure to lead was minor , on the grounds that only tests that revealed low lead levels were lost .
A government scientist spoke to Renner about Brown 's justification for excusing the ' lost data . '
" When CDC learned the data was missing , someone could have called the lab and asked for it .
If it was the lab 's mistake , they would have sent the data . "
Environmental engineer Marc Edwards of Virginia
Tech is conducting his own investigation , and found that numerous high results were also omitted .
Edwards was disturbed by what he found in his re-examination of drinking - water and lead blood - level data .
In 2007 , Edwards filed a complaint of scientific misconduct with the CDC , alleging that Brown knew about serious flaws in the data but refused to acknowledge them when writing the 2004 CDC report .
CDC is not the only authority implicated in the cover - up of D.C. 's lead problem .
Also under fire for their handling of the crisis is the city 's Water and Sewer Authority and Health Department ( WASA ) .
WASA sent inspectors to the homes of children with elevated blood lead to look for the source .
A congressional hearing forced officials to testify that in every case the assessments showed that water was not the source of the child 's lead exposure .
But a recent re-assessment , conducted by Edwards , revealed that water was the sole source of the blood poisoning in some homes .
Even though hundreds of test showed blood - lead levels that were much higher than so - called " EPA action levels " for three years , the EPA admitted to knowing about the " massive " lead problem " a few months " before the public knew , according to Salon News .
" At first we did n't think it was a big problem and WASA for the most part complied with the rules , " Rick Rogers , who supervised EPA 's work on the lead crisis in Washington , told Salon .
The parents of young twins , who believe lead exposure caused developmental problems with their children , filed a $ 200 m lawsuit in February .

People have long known that music can trigger powerful recollections , but now a brain - scan study has revealed where this happens in our noggins .
The part of the brain known as the medial pre-frontal cortex sits just behind the forehead , acting like recent Oscar host Hugh Jackman singing and dancing down Hollywood 's memory lane .
" What seems to happen is that a piece of familiar music serves as a soundtrack for a mental movie that starts playing in our head . " said Petr Janata , a cognitive neuroscientist at University of California , Davis .
" It calls back memories of a particular person or place , and you might all of a sudden see that person 's face in your mind 's eye . "
Janata began suspecting the medial pre-frontal cortex as a music - processing and music - memories region when he saw that part of the brain actively tracking chord and key changes in music .
He had also seen studies which showed the same region lighting up in response to self - reflection and recall of autobiographical details , and so he decided to examine the possible music - memory link by recruiting 13 UC - Davis students .
Test subjects went under an fMRI brain scanner and listened to 30 different songs randomly chosen from the Billboard " Top 100 " music charts from years when the subjects would have been 8 to 18 years old .
They signaled researchers when a certain 30 - second music sample triggered any autobiographical memory , as opposed to just being a familiar or unfamiliar song .
" This is the first study using music to look at [ the neural correlates of ] autobiographical memory , " Janata told LiveScience .
His full study is detailed online this week in the journal Cerebral Cortex .
The students also filled out the details of their memories in a survey immediately following the MRI session , explaining the content and clarity of their recollections .
Most recognized about 17 out of 30 music samples on average , with about 13 having moderate or strong links with a memory from their lives .
Janata saw that tunes linked to the strongest self - reported memories triggered the most vivid and emotion - filled responses – findings corroborated by the brain scan showing spikes in mental activity within the medial prefrontal cortex .
The brain region responded quickly to music signature and timescale , but also reacted overall when a tune was autobiographically relevant .
Furthermore , music tracking activity in the brain was stronger during more powerful autobiographical memories .
This latest research could explain why even Alzheimer 's patients who endure increasing memory loss can still recall songs from their distant past .
" What 's striking is that the prefrontal cortex is among the last [ brain regions ] to atrophy , " Janata noted .
He pointed to behavioral observations of Alzheimer 's patients singing along or brightening up when familiar songs came on .
Janata said that his research merely tried to establish a neuroscience basis for why music can tickle memory .
He voiced the hope that his and other studies could encourage practices such as giving iPods to Alzheimer 's patients – perhaps providing real - life testament to the power of music .
" It 's not going to reverse the disease , " Janata said .
" But if you can make quality of life better , why not ? "
I first thought there might be something wrong with my therapist when I arrived for my 8 am appointment to find a hipster mixed - race couple sitting in his waiting room .
Dr. Sandy ( yes , he goes by that – another sign that there ’s something wrong with him ) apologized , muttering something about his voicemail service being screwy .
At my make - up session , he asked how I was feeling about my relationship with my girlfriend .
I told him that sometimes I felt like breaking up with her .
“ Good , you should . ” “ Feel that way ? ” “ No . Break up with her . ”
I ’ve been in therapy since I was sixteen and I ’ve never had a therapist give me explicit advice unless it was something blatantly obvious like “ Do n’t kill yourself . ”
But here Dr. Sandy was just laying his opinion on the line .
It was almost like he took his cock and balls out and slapped ‘em on the table .
“ Here – take a look at these ! ” I was supposed to meet my girlfriend in Pittsburgh for a wedding she was taking part in .
Dr. Sandy told me to call her and tell her I was n’t coming .
I said I thought that was kind of a dick move ; that if I was going to break up with her , I ’d rather do it in person and not ruin her weekend while she was out of town .
He said he ’d have to think that one over .
The final straw came when I showed for another early morning appointment and he was n’t there .
He returned my call and said he had a meeting at his son ’s school and did n’t have my number handy .
If I cancel on this asshole , I have to pay his entire rate – before insurance kicks in .
But he does n’t even need to call me and tell me not to show up .
I ’ve got better things to do than sit in his waiting room reading old issues of Westways ( caveat – I did find a great recipe for souvlaki ) .
Like any relationship , I got something positive from my time with Dr. Sandy .
Instead of yelling at my girlfriend or family , I channel my rage into a journal like a twelve - year - old girl .
And handjobs .
That man was the Picasso of cock - stroking .
Sperrlisten für Kinderpornografie BKA filtert das Web
Ein Sieg im Kampf gegen Kinderpornografie ?

This could well be the mother of all Zooms !
Weighing 16kg and measuring 880 mm in an overall length and there is just no comparing optic to match this lense in its basic spec - t hat is not exaggerating to replicate a famous slogan from Saddam Hussein to quote here , huh ?
Since most of us have not and rarely will have any chance to see this lense in its physical form ( guarantee will make your eye - brows raised straight up ! ) , so let us do n't waste time talk about how well it can perform optically or how smooth the zooming action is blah blah blah etc. .. but rather , simply based on its spec sheet , we will confine the discussion on other aspects relating to its viability , possibilities , development history and future expectation .
If you have nothing to do and have all the time in the world to do something out of nothing or if you have a high speed Internet access which you think is under utilized , by all means click on the image to see an enlarged blowup view ( 93 k ) Jpeg .
Credit :
All images appeared in this page was originally scanned from a 1998 's Nikkor Sales Guide .
The image at the top of the page has been retouched slightly to restore to colours where I think it is supposed to be after examining the scan .
Similarly , the blowup view has also being retouched in its colour appearance .
Showcased in 1990 , this lense could also well be the most expensive optic for 35 mm SLR photography that money can buy offers by any lens / camera manufacturers .
To get a rough idea how big is this amazing super telephoto zoom lense is , probably we will need a scale to compare its dimension .
As you know prior to availability of this zoom , the longest optic ( in terms of length , not focal length ) in the Nikkor lens family was used to be the Zoom - Nikkor 360 - 1200 mm f/11 ED which has a 704 mm physical extension .
While the 360 - 1200 mm zoom has not had an IF ( Internal Focus ) design , the IF - equipped 1200 - 1700 mm 's length of 880 mm can well be considered as quite an " achievement " purely from a perspective of lens designing .
Well , while that is only referring to its length , but actually it is the diameter of the lense that separates the two super - zooms into different league .
The 360 - 1200 mm has a lens diameter of 125 mm but the 1200 - 1700 mm lens is 237 mm !
The main factor contributes to such vast difference in their respective dimension are their varying light gathering power .
The 360 - 1200 mm zoom 's f/11 could have been designed to provide an optimum balance between lens handling and performance so as to keep the it physically viable to be carry around and use .
But portability is perhaps not a top priority with the 1200 - 1700 mm lens , but rather , it was designed specifically for performance ( and / or the status to showcase Nikon 's designing capability )
It has a very fast aperture of f /5.6 ( 1200 mm ) and graduates as it zooms and reaches one f- stop slower at f/8.0 when reaching another end of its zoom range at 1700 mm .
This Nikkor zoom is / was the current ^ fastest lense ( as at 2005 ) in its class ( only comparable by Canon 's FDn 800 mm f/5.6 L or 3rd party optic such as Sigmas ' 350- 1200 mm f/11 APO
Tele - Zoom as their respective " corporate status product icon ) ) & it will be a long time before it will be excelled by others ( even by Nikon themselves ) obviously , you do n't expect it can sell very well in numbers except for big budget scientific / military / surveillance expenditure of governmental agencies - I would n't entirely write off affordable individuals too )
The variable lens speed design could have aimed to make the lens slightly more " compact " rather than adopting a design that offers a constant aperture of f /5.6 across its entire zoom range which would have enlarging its overall dimension .
This is NOT an AF lense .
Despite it was introduced in the beginning of the '90 where other than the Non - AF Nikon FM2n ( Nikon FE10 and Nikon FM10 ) , virtually everything produced by Nikon amidst this period were using autofocus as the platform for their products because that is where the users ' focus , attention and revenue is .
So , why not an AF lense being produced ?
Instead , Nikon has only designed a CPU chip set that enables the lense integrates for Matrix Metering ( and other workable auto - exposure control modes ) with applicable Nikon SLRs .
That essentially explained why the lens designation " Zoom - Nikkor 1200 - 1700 mm f/5.6~f/8.0s P ED IF " has a " P " which signifies this unique feature .
Along with the MF Nikkor 500 mm f/4.0s P ED IF super telephoto , this Nikkor zoom was one of the two manual focus Nikkor lenses that bear such identification and feature / function .
Coming back to the question of why not an AF version being produced ?
Well , probably the only logical explanation for this decision was laid with the prevailing AF technology at the time during designing the lense ( not referring to date of introduction , as designing and manufacturing such a lens type may well be pushing the lens design stage a few years backward to around 1987 / 8 ) does not permit a camera 's servo motor to drive such a long extension in its focus rotation efficiently , even if it incorporate an ingenious IF design .
Well , mind me to remind you the first AF - I Nikkor lense , 300 mm f/2.8s ED -IF with a coreless DC micro-motor built into the lens to aid camera 's autofocusing was only being introduced in 1992 .
Will an AF equivalent be introduced in the future ?
A high possibility .
Because the only significant feature missing in this lense is a AF - S type of lens design to enable it to be more practical , efficient and viable to be used responsively for shooting fast pace action type of photography .
Imagine how can all the amazingly - spec Nikon bodies of F5 , F100 , D1X ( H ) be not using AF focus tracking and has to resort to operate manually in a lense with only less than a 2° angle of view ?
Similarly , neither any user would be seriously considering a potential investment into such an expensive optic without an AF function right ?
Okay , since we have mentioned the " view " of the lense , we may have a good topic for discussion here , the extreme narrow picture angle of 2° - 1°30 the lense provides , along with its massive weight and dimension which often restrict mobility for photographers do demand some wistful thinking here - it is not a question of whether you can afford it or not but rather can you find some rightful subject topic to put the lense into good use .
And it follows by another question , can you handle such a super long reaching Manual Focus zoom lense efficiently or not .
If you still do n't understand what I have meant here - try using a simpler Reflex - Nikkor 500 mm f/8.0s to shoot a Formula 1 event , as race cars that can speed up to 300 kph within few seconds , the main handing problem for such kind of photography is actually the narrow angle of view that make it so difficult to follow the action , unless you are contented just shooting stationary scenes such as tires changing during pit-stops or at best , anticipating those speed - demos that may reach a specific pre-focus cornering near the track etc .... )

Subject : about the Nikkor 1200 mm - 1700 mm
Hello , first of all I hope you are fine and enjoying life !!
I wanted to thank you for the Nikkor and nikon information sanctuary you have built it has been very useful :)
In Reuter´s blog there is a great article talking about how a photographer used the Nikkor 1200 - 1700 mm to take some photos of the president of France during Bastilla Day Parade check it out http://blogs.reuters.com/2007/07/18/unleashing-the-beast
Kind regards , Eduar

This lens is not for the ordinary .
Not even professionals in their own capacity because pros usually have the ability to adjust themselves and reverting any unfavorable photographic situations ( added the fact , most successful pros with conventional wisdom in the profession are usually also smart in financial management ) .
So , only large and established media / press houses and / or governmental agencies can afford such kind of investment ( I do n't entirely write off people who has nothing to do such as those superrich individual (s ) who may be curiously want to record on film on board his private yacht who is with his recent " identified target (s ) " on another yacht a mile away from his etc ... ) .
Joke aside , some proper applications of this spectacular super - tele zoom could be on scientific research , wildlife observations , solar or lunar photography , surveillance , headlined political events , major international sport meets and other kinds of situation where they are inaccessible for photographers to close in during shooting such as reporting for rocket launching , rioting , air strike bombing in a possible war ( again ? ) etc .
A little off - the - topic : Err ... come to think of it , other than NASA , I think some selective privileged agencies like the CIA and MI - 5 might be the biggest fans of Nikon and probably may have a few dozen of these in their possession , the KGB might not have any because budget for the agency is probably being deferred ; as for the rich individual pros who wants to bring the lense on the field , he might need a jeep but it is advisable confine to shoot wildlife such as rhinos , lions , endangered species of birds , yaks or the kangaroos ... well , do n't even think of bringing the camouflaged jeep near a war zone , because the mobile - rocket launcher - look appearance of the lense and the focusing action of the photographer may invite some hostile return artillery fire from nowhere , hehe ...
Well , this the the last section on the featured Nikkor zooms series - can afford to exhale a little of my dampened and compressed spirit within while ready to inhale some O 2 to stay awake before switching to the PC - Nikkor sections next ... - leofoo ® - 23/02/2003
The shortest distance the lense can focus close - in is 10 m ( 35 ft . ) .
Although not entirely impressive in figures but neither this lense is designed to taking close - up facial expression pictures ( you might as well buy a telephoto or a Reflex - Nikkor 2000 mm f/11s lense and save yourself a couple of ten thousand ) .
Although in theory , the use of a Tele - Extender (s ) may able to shorten its minimum focusing distance , but Nikon has not specified any compatible TC devices for such purpose .
So do n't be a hero to play around with this expensive optic even if you can afford to do so .
The rear lens mount of the lense is equipped with a series of pins / contacts which almost looks like AF contacts ( primarily for relaying data via chipset on lense section with the circuitry on camera section ) .
This native Ai - S lense has also provided with ADR scales for direct viewing of picture taking aperture and full aperture metering / viewing / composing of pictures is possible with any applicable Nikon bodies .
Naturally , although it is a high speed super telephoto zoom but logically other photographic operational measures such as choice of the right focusing screens and selection of high speed film types and more importantly , an ultra-steady tripod setup during shooting is a MUST to accommodate its Extra - ordinary weight , these may be able help in ensuring minimize any changes of spoilt images arising from possible shaky movement on camera / lens / slow - shutter - speeds during shooting .
The technical highlights of this incredibly unique and powerful Nikkor tele - zoom can be summarized as follows ( Note : This optic is on a special order - to - produce basis ) :
The optical design is comprised of a 18 elements in 13 groups ( 3 x EDs ) optical formulation with an Internal focus design .
Extremely narrow angle of view from 2° - 1°30 ; it focuses down to 10 m ( 35 ft. ) and two focusing / distance indexes are provided , orange ( 1700 mm ) and green ( 1200 mm ) .
Full aperture viewing and metering is possible but meter coupling ridge is NOT provided on the lense .
Its CPU design to integrate for Matrix Metering and various auto - exposure modes with all applicable Nikon SLRs .
It uses 52 mm slide - in filters ( L37C supplied ) via a filter holder at mid section .
Lens hood is a built - in type .
It weighs a massive 16,000g ( approx . 36 Ibs ) and measures 237 mm in dia .
and a length of 880 mm ( overall ) without lens hood extension .
Tripod mounting is via socket in a fixed tripod mounting collar , carrying by a fixed rigid handle built - in on top of the lense .
With the inclusion of this powerful zoom in the Nikkor lens family , Nikon can safely claim its system now has the most comprehensive selection of lenses in the widest of picture angle ( MF Nikkor 6 mm f/2.8s ) , longest reach in focal length with the MF Reflex - Nikkor 2000 mm and now , the most powerful zoom lense for 35 mm photography .

Deism , the simple belief in God based on the application of our reason on the designs in Nature , the study of which is science , and which Deists see as evidence of the Designer , seems to be growing in America .
One of the most authoritative surveys on religion in America , the American Religious Identification Survey , shows that for the first time the number of Americans who fit the traditional dictionary definition of a Deist , belief in a higher power but not in a personal God , is at 12 percent .
This definition of a Deist is not completely accurate .
Many Deists do not believe in a personal God while others do .
Since there is no dogma in Deism , people are free to believe what they want .
The only two requirements for being a Deist is belief in God as mentioned above and rejection of all the claims of the ' revealed ' religions to having received a special divine revelation , to having special powers of healing , etc .
If this more broad definition was included in the classification of Deistic belief in the survey , the number of people holding a Deistic belief would be much greater .
Deism is very libertarian in nature .
There are no priests , rabbis or any clergymen to tell people what to do , what not to do and what to believe .
There are no holy books to follow .
From the ARIS report , it seems that a growing number of Americans are turned off by the bureaucracy of organized ' revealed ' religions .
For example , the survey shows the percentage of Christians in the U.S. fell from 86 percent in 1990 to 76 percent in 2008 .
The main reason given for this decline is rejection by people of organized religion .
Deism is much more in line with the libertarian point made by Bill Maher when he said , ' Religion , to me , is a bureaucracy between man and God that I do n't need . '
In addition to people rethinking their religious beliefs and moving towards Deism , many people who are still remaining within Christianity are nevertheless rethinking their beliefs and moving away from the more traditional , inflexible , bureaucratic , government - like sects .
Most of them are embracing non-denominational Christianity .
Mark Silk , the director of the Public Values Program which conducted the survey , said , ' It looks like the two - party system of American Protestantism ' mainline versus evangelical ' is collapsing . '
As people get into Deism more , they eventually become aware of the Biblical teachings in Romans 13 : 1 - 7 which teaches people to be obedient to and fearful of ' the powers that be '/ government officials .
They also learn of Thomas Jefferson 's Deistic / libertarian ideas on this twisted Biblical teaching that he expressed in a letter he wrote on June 24 , 1826 , just two weeks before his death on July 4 .
Jefferson wrote , ' May it ' ( the Fourth of July ) 'be to the world , what I believe it will be , ( to some parts sooner , to others later , but finally to all , ) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves , and to assume the blessings and security of self - government .
. . .
The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth , that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs , nor a favored few booted and spurred , ready to ride them legitimately , by the grace of God . '
Hopefully , as people express their libertarian nature in religion by moving away from the formal ' revealed ' religions and towards the natural religion / philosophy of Deism and to other less traditional belief systems , they will carry this over into politics .
With being freshly burned by the ' change we can believe in ' meaningless and empty mantra of Obama and the Democrats , perhaps they will in greater numbers begin to realize that politicians , regardless of what they say and which party they belong to , are nothing but politicians .
Their words have no meaning because their driving force is self - promotion .
When this happens , the plutocratic con-game will be over !
c4 " >Robert Johnson is a paralegal and a freelance writer in Florida .
He was raised Roman Catholic , but after reading Thomas Paine 's The Age of Reason , he became a Deist .
In 1993 he founded the World Union of Deists and in 1996 he launched the first web site devoted to Deism , www.deism.com.
He is listed in Who 's Who in Hell and is the author of Deism : A Revolution in Religion , A Revolution in You .

Will America 's Deistic Shift Lead to a Libertarian Shift ?
by Robert L. Johnson
San Francisco
CHILLING testimony by Israeli soldiers substantiates charges that Israel ’s Gaza Strip assault entailed grave violations of international law .
The emergence of a predominantly right - wing , nationalist government in Israel suggests that there may be more violations to come .
Hamas ’s indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians also constituted war crimes , but do not excuse Israel ’s transgressions .
While Israel disputes some of the soldiers ’ accounts , the evidence suggests that Israel committed the following six offenses :
 Violating its duty to protect the civilian population of the Gaza Strip .
Despite Israel ’s 2005 “ disengagement ” from Gaza , the territory remains occupied .
Israel unleashed military firepower against a people it is legally bound to protect .
 Imposing collective punishment in the form of a blockade , in violation of Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention .
In June 2007 , after Hamas took power in the Gaza Strip , Israel imposed suffocating restrictions on trade and movement .
The blockade  an act of war in customary international law  has helped plunge families into poverty , children into malnutrition , and patients denied access to medical treatment into their graves .
People in Gaza thus faced Israel ’s winter onslaught in particularly weakened conditions .
 Deliberately attacking civilian targets .
The laws of war permit attacking a civilian object only when it is making an effective contribution to military action and a definite military advantage is gained by its destruction .
Yet an Israeli general , Dan Harel , said , “ We are hitting not only terrorists and launchers , but also the whole Hamas government and all its wings . ”
An Israeli military spokeswoman , Maj . Avital Leibovich , avowed that “ anything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target . ”
Israeli fire destroyed or damaged mosques , hospitals , factories , schools , a key sewage plant , institutions like the parliament , the main ministries , the central prison and police stations , and thousands of houses .
This year I had the pleasure to be one of the official bloggers for the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) , which is winding down as I write .
But rather than writing an action report with a long “ to - do ” list for fellow conservatives , I feel like writing an obituary for the conservative movement would be more appropriate .
On the positive side of the ledger , this was a rare opportunity to meet many top conservative bloggers and put faces with the names .
Without an exception , these are all wonderful , truly dedicated people .
If there is hope for conservatives in the future — an issue in doubt if CPAC really is representative of the movement — the spirit that animates the conservative blogger community will be critical to helping emerge from the political wilderness .
That said , however , those of us inhabiting the official bloggers row , sponsored this year by Pajamas Media , are clearly considered the red - headed stepchildren by CPAC ’s organizers .
The best evidence for this was that bloggers row was situated at the back corner of the exhibit hall ( which doubles as the first floor of the hotel ’s parking garage ) .
The organizers could not have positioned us any farther from the events here at CPAC without setting us up outside the building .
In contrast to political left , where bloggers and new media have propelled Democrats to stunning victory and are courted by their politicians at the annual Daily Kos convention , the conservative establishment still has no idea what to do with new media .
This year ’s CPAC was the largest on record .
It was encouraging to see the large herds of students moving throughout the hotel .
Unfortunately , the constant theme those students heard during this year ’s CPAC was that the proper role of the conservative movement is as cheerleader for the GOP .
I must strongly dissent .
Ever since George H.W. Bush violated his no new taxes pledge and announced the appointment of David Souter to the Supreme Court , the conservative movement has been the victim of nearly two decades of serial gang rape by the Republican Party and its leadership ( George H.W. Bush , Trent Lott , Bob Dole , John McCain , Newt Gingrich , Denny Hastert , George W. Bush , et al . ) .
Tying our fortunes to the Republican Party is the worst mistake that conservatives have made during the past half - century .
Our salvation does not reside with the GOP , but by distancing ourselves from it .
Many of this year ’s CPAC speakers are the very architects of our political exile .
Rather than coming to us in sackcloth and ashes for their total failure of leadership , they came with red meat one - liners intended to distract the crowd .
The fact of the matter is that before the 2006 elections , just a little over two years ago , Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress .
It is n’t entirely clear that the GOP leadership is even aware that the situation has changed , let alone that they are personally responsible for it .
It is interesting that Ronald Reagan ’s name was constantly being invoked by CPAC speakers .
I ’m old enough to remember the 1976 and 1980 elections , and Ronald Reagan was the conservative outsider , not a GOP insider .
His strength came from the power of his ideas , which frequently were at odds with the dominant Gerald R. Ford / Nelson Rockefeller wing of the GOP .
That the conservative movement has slid into complete irrelevancy was demonstrated by the absence of any ideas — nay , any discussion whatsoever — of several of the most pressing political issues of our day .
As fellow blogger Pamela Geller of Atlas Shrugged observed , there was not a single panel on the War on Terror , the growing threats to free speech , or the cultural jihad underway in the West .
What should have been one of the most important events of this year ’s CPAC , the appearance by Dutch parliamentarian and anti-jihad activist Geert Wilders , was relegated to the opposite side of the hotel , divorced from all of the other conference proceedings .
There were no official announcements that this event would even be taking place ( none that I heard at least ) , and when trying to locate the room in which it would be held , not a single CPAC staffer could tell me where .
And this event only happened because David Horowitz , Pamela Geller , Robert Spencer , and Andy Bostom personally shelled out the money to make it happen .
Now CPAC organizers would no doubt respond that they could not fit Wilders into the schedule on such short notice .
But I have no doubt that if Bristol Palin had suddenly come available to address CPAC on the virtues of teen pregnancy , David Keene and the American Conservative Union would no doubt have moved heaven and earth to make room in the schedule for her .
But they could not accommodate a man who lives under constant death threats by a long list of Islamic terrorist organizations .
Honestly , I do n’t know much about Geert Wilders ’ politics .
I only met the man briefly , and I heard his stump speech twice on Friday .
But anyone who has a stack of fatwas calling for his death because of his willingness to speak out against the global jihad is going to receive my support , regardless of any politically incorrect view he may or may not hold .
From my limited perspective , all Geert Wilders has done is hold a mirror up to reflect back the ugly racism and advocacy of violence that are the staple of the most prominent and authoritative officials in Islam .
For that he has earned nothing but enmity from the avowed enemies of the West .
But it was n’t enough to earn him a speaking spot on this year ’s CPAC schedule .
Meanwhile , GOP operative and Karl Rove confidante Grover Norquist , who is single - handedly responsible for opening the doors of political power for convicted al - Qaeda fundraiser Abdurahman Alamoudi and Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Sami Al - Arian , was given the honor of introducing House Minority Leader John Boehner on Friday morning .
The contrast between the cold reception of Wilders and the warm embrace of Norquist by CPAC could not be any starker .
If this year ’s CPAC is an accurate indicator , conservatives have many lonely years ahead in political exile .
Bereft of ideas and locked in an abusive relationship with a political party that has shown nothing but contempt for conservatives , CPAC represents what is wrong with the conservative movement .
In terms of representing the way forward for conservatives , CPAC is an epic fail .
But I am of the opinion that the real situation is not quite as dire .
There is a growing discontent among the grassroots as seen in the recent Tea Party events popping up around the country .
And as President Obama , Senate Leader Harry Reid , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi impose their massive New Squeal program , that grassroots discontent might lead to the overthrow of the “ official ” leadership of the conservative movement , including CPAC .
In my humble opinion , that change could n’t come quickly enough .
DEARBORN , Mich. , April 22 ( UPI ) -- General Motors Corp. Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said Wednesday the U.S. automaker would not meet a $ 1 billion debt payment due June 1 .
The struggling company , which has a month and eight days to come up with a restructuring plan to secure additional emergency loans from the government , would either have a new deal with creditors lined up or would file for bankruptcy protection by the time the deadline comes around , he said , speaking to reporters in Dearborn , Mich. , the Detroit Free Press reported .

" We 're not going to make that payment , " Young said .
" That 's part of the reason why we 're going to get this thing done one way or another in 60 days . "
" That 's the deadline , " he said .
Without a deal in place with creditors , GM has warned , it would face the possibility of default .
A week ago , interim Chief Executive Officer Fritz Henderson said a bankruptcy filing was " probable . "
Young backed up Henderson 's assessment , but said , " my energies are focused upon making sure we get a bond exchange . "
The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that , because Manny Ramirez 's drug test showed elevated testosterone levels but no human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) , some anti-doping experts feel that result indicates that some other substance may have caused the raised level .
The paper reported that the tests , plus the way Major League Baseball responded , indicated that Ramirez " used steroids . "
As ESPN reported earlier this week , Ramirez and his representatives were prepared to appeal his 50 - game ban for violating Major League Baseball 's drug policy based on the fact that test results from a World Anti-Doping Agency lab in Montreal showed that he had an elevated level of synthetic testosterone .
Ramirez 's representatives intended to argue he had taken a steroid precursor known as DHEA , according to two sources .
DHEA is n't on baseball 's banned - substance list , but is banned by WADA .
Professor Christiane Ayotte , director of the WADA - accredited lab in Montreal where Ramirez 's sample was tested , told the Los Angeles Times that her lab knew that DHEA was not on baseball 's banned list .
One source told the Times that baseball had three " powerful analytic foundations " to say the positive drug test was not caused by DHEA .
Because of that , sources told the Times , MLB would not have declared a positive drug test if DHEA was the only reason .
And therefore , the test must have shown something else .
ESPN reported earlier that testing showed Ramirez had used hCG , which is typically used by steroid users to restart their bodies ' natural testosterone production as they come off a steroid cycle .
It is similar to Clomid , the drug Barry Bonds , Jason Giambi and others used as clients of BALCO .
After the drug test showed an elevated level of synthetic testosterone , an appeal of Ramirez 's ban was scheduled for May 6 .
MLB 's legal team intended to use expert testimony to cite evidence it believed showed DHEA could not have been the cause of the synthetic testosterone .
However , in the days before the hearing , the MLB players ' union turned over Ramirez 's medical records -- and they including a prescription written for hCG .
That was enough to secure a 50 - game suspension , Ramirez dropped the appeal , and sources told ESPN that baseball then did n't test to find out what actually caused the increased levels .
Ramirez 's suspension was announced on May 7 .
In an ambitious proposal to counter global warming , an upstart power developer wants to build a coal - fired electric plant on the outskirts of New York City that would capture its emissions of carbon dioxide and pump the pollutant 70 miles offshore .
The gas would be injected into sandstone a mile beneath the ocean floor in the hope that it would stay there for eons .
Experts have thought for years that capturing the emissions from power plants will be a crucial technology for limiting climate change .
But high cost projections and scientific uncertainty have meant that progress on the technique has been limited , even as the effects of global warming are starting to be felt around the world .
Now SCS Energy , based in Concord , Mass. , contends not only that it can build the world ’s first such plant and get it to work , but also do so profitably , despite costs that could approach $ 5 billion .
If it succeeded , the plant might become a model that could be copied elsewhere .
A key to the proposal is location : an old industrial site near the shore in Linden , N.J. , just across the Arthur Kill waterway from Staten Island .
Generating power there would allow the company to sell it into one of the country ’s most expensive markets , and injecting the gas deep beneath the ocean floor , where pressure would help keep it down , would eliminate some of the uncertainty that might attend a similar project on land .
Sirius Founder : You ’re 10 Years Too Late , Karmazin
Is it too late for Sirius XM ?
CEO Mel Karmazin and John Malone , whose Liberty Media ( LINTA ) just tossed the foundering satellite radio outfit a $ 530 million lifeline , clearly do n’t believe so .
So do the company ’s long - suffering investors who continue to stand by it , though their faith has been sorely shaken .
But the same cannot be said for Martine Rothblatt , the entrepreneur who founded Sirius ( SIRI ) nearly 20 years ago .
She feels Sirius ’s chances for real success may have died years ago –dealt a mortal blow by the FCC , which delayed its launch , depriving it of the competitive advantage it might have had over MP3 players like the iPod and later free Internet radio services .
“ There has been a huge growth in terrestrial alternatives , ” Rothblatt told Fortune .
“ As we move from third - generation to fourth - generation cellular , there ’s going to be ever more bandwidth available to distribute content totally via terrestrial cellular infrastructure .
And that will leave fewer and fewer unique market attributes to satellite radio .
Technologies have their ideal times and places , and in my opinion the better time for satellite radio was 10 years ago . ”
So much for that first - mover advantage …
A grim assessment for Sirius , which had just seemed to be getting an edge on its daunting troubles .
But Rothblatt has a point .
Internet radio is gaining traction and once cellular networks evolve to the point where they can deliver it to cars and other devices , how can satellite compete ?
Howard Stern ’s going to retire sooner or later …
PREVIOUSLY :
I would love my next car to be electric .
My dream car is the Tesla .
When I tell people that they often assume I am in the habit of cuddling forestry , but in fact while the environment is of course an important factor , I actually think they are just really cool .
Problem is , everyone I speak to seems to disagree with me .
The inevitable reply is " Yeah , but ... " .
What is stopping the electric from becoming mainstream , when the technology has clearly been available for a while now ?
I decided to do an informal poll of my email and Twitter friends to find out .
Here are the main objections I got back , see how many apply to you :
10 Reasons You Would n't Buy an Electric Car ( Yet )
Economy -
Some people expressed the worry that running , insuring and maintaining an electric would be pricey , because these things are so new , the infrastructure is n't there to support it , and repairs might be complicated .
Basically , that you would be stung for being an early buyer like with so many other gadgets .
The counter - argument is that electric cars have far fewer moving parts , or parts of any kind really , so there is less to go wrong and fewer bits and pieces that wear out .
Would insurance be any different to petrol ?
Distance Per Charge -
A lot of people said they worried about how far they could go before running out of juice , and the issue that you can hardly walk to the nearest gas station for a bucket of volts .
Most of these cars though can do more than enough for most families daily mileage .
The Tesla , they claim , can do between 200 and 244 miles per charge .
Obviously this covers the majority of an average persons daily travel , but would leave some people stranded , which leads us to the next " point " ... Availability of Charging Points -
Due to the fact almost nobody has an electric car there are no recharging points .
Compare that to the number of gas stations and it looks like a problem .
While you can use a standard power socket if you are in a fix , the next issue rears its ugly head ... Charging Time -
Even the best of these systems takes hours , not minutes to top up .
In fact Tesla advise you to think of it as being an overnight habit .
Not exactly the kind of marketing that leads you to think you could recharge at the side of the road !
Reliability - Watch Top Gears controversial review on YouTube and you would be forgiven for thinking that the Tesla is a super car , but an unreliable one .
20090303-d2tyerbwubtq9wc223qyn18psx.png
It turns out that things might not have been presented entirely factually .
That said , the impression persists that Electric would not be as reliable as a gas - guzzler , just because they are so new and all the kinks and bugs have n't been ironed out .
Stigma -
While I have been lusting after an electric car for a while , I know that many people look at these machines very differently .
In fact , there are any number of stigma attached , from people who regard eco-fans as " hippies " , to others who question the machismo of anyone who would be seen in such a wimpy , " feminine " auto .
Perhaps the Tesla counters this somewhat , but the average driver is not going to have the funds to buy one , so the other brands need to work on their image !
20090303-p6261edwysg7wwmh9yue2g4r1n.png
Design - Talking of image , the Tesla looks beautiful .
20090303-t213cjq6ga9ira96f9tbk2nba6.png Watch Robert LLewellyn drive and discuss the Tesla here .
But it is hardly practical .
You are not going to be able to go shopping because every available crevice is crammed with batteries , and any family are going to have to strap down to the roof .
This is not going to be an easy sell to your spouse as a family runabout .
Taking all the above into account probably means you are going to need a second car , wiping out any " carbon footprint " considerations you had in mind .
Speed / Power - The Tesla ( as shown above ) produces up to 288 horses , but the really impressive statistic is the torque , which is where electric cars really outshine their oil burning cousins .
The humbler , more realistic cars do not break any records for power , but nor would you expect them to .
Due to better technology , the electric cars crawling at 5 mph uphill are hopefully a thing of the past .
Eco / Green Credentials -
While you would expect eco-credentials to be a factor in favor of the electric , some people were at pains to point out stories they had heard about the batteries , and point out that electricity production was not 100 % spotlessly clean .
In answer I would say first that technology is improving all the time , both in battery manufacture and energy production .
Secondly , I would rather concentrate the pollution in specific , solvable areas , rather than spread the pollution around as we do currently .
Disagree ?
Price - Now the big one , and the reason I have no video to show you of me madly grinning behind the wheel of my own Tesla .
The price is just too high for the average family to consider .
Until the price comes down , everything else will be moot .
Taking all this into account , I think the big issues are Price , followed by Convenience .
The price has to be realistic and you need to know that you are going to be able to get where you need to go and back without having to call roadside assistance .
While it is often seen as a " green " issue I think far more important in many people 's minds is economics .
What do you think ?
Have I got it wrong ?
Have you ever driven an electric car ?
What did you think ?
Would you like to try one ?
Please share your thoughts in the comments ...
Marvel Comics has dedicated the month leading up to the “ Wolverine ” movie ’s May 1 release ( which is also Wolverine ’s 35th anniversary ) to “ the best there is at what he does ” with two major events .
First up is a new series titled “ Wolverine : Weapon X ” ( shipping April 8th ) by the creative team of writer Jason Aaron and artist Ron Garney , featuring variant covers by some of the biggest talents in the industry .
And speaking of art , Marvel will unveil their line of “ fine art ” covers throughout the month as part of “ Wolverine Art Appreciation Month . ”
Throughout April , several Marvel titles will feature variant covers spotlighting Wolverine in ways never seen before — inspired by some of the most renowned names in the world of fine art .
In other words , Marvel ’s roster of A - list artists will reinterpret Wolverine in styles reminiscent of Pablo Picasso , Salvador Dali , Andy Warhol and other notables .
“ This is a huge year for Wolverine as he proves why he ’s arguably one of the most popular characters in the world , ” explained Joe Quesada , Marvel Comics Editor - in - Chief .
“ He ’s not just popular with fans but also with artists , as evidenced by how many of today ’s top comic artists jockey for a chance to draw him .
This got us thinking : what if Wolverine had been around for hundreds , if not thousands , of years ?
What great , classic artists would want a crack at drawing a Wolverine cover ? ”

Can a Website Be Prosecuted for Users ' Crimes ?
Craigslist Targeted by South Carolina AG
In the wake of the disastrous press generated for Craigslist by alleged " Craigslist Killer " Philip Markoff , it probably should come as little surprise that Craigslist is now reported to be engaging in talks with the Attorney Generals of a number of states aimed at getting rid of ads on the site for prostitution and " other suspected illegal sexual activities " .
However , for South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster , this might be too little , too late .
According to the AP , McMaster sent a letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster saying that , despite much of the " valuable service " provided the public by the site , " it appears that the management of Craigslist has knowingly allowed the site to be used for illegal and unlawful activity after warnings from law enforcement officials and after an agreement with 40 state attorneys general . "
The letter goes on to give Craigslist until May 15 to take down " sex - related postings from its South Carolina sites " or face prosecution .
Now that sounds pretty daunting , particularly coming from a state Attorney General , but does Craigslist really have anything to worry about here ?
The legal reality for web sites such as Craigslist is that federal law generally immunizes them for the postings of third - parties using the site ( e.g. , user - generated ads or posts ) .
Specifically , Section 230 of the Communications Decency
Act provides that : " No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as a publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider . "
Craigslist , for its part , has faced pressure from states ' attorney generals in the past , and actually agreed to implement certain safeguards such as user - flagging of improper postings .
So why would Craigslist even come to the table to discuss the matter with the state AG's , you might wonder ?
Well , the negative press plus the costs of a potential litigation blitz alone might make it a good business decision for Craigslist to sit down and at least discuss ways with which it can address some of the concerns being raised .
CEO Jim Buckmaster seemed to say as much via a statement , saying he " anticipates making further progress toward the common goal of eliminating illegal activity from craigslist , while preserving its full utility and benefit for tens of millions of law - abiding Americans who value and depend on craigslist 's free local community services in their everyday lives . "
The degree of immunity and freedom with which websites operate online has been under increasing scrutiny in recent months in other ways too .
One example would be that review sites such as Yelp have been sued by individuals who want to get at users who allegedly post defamatory reviews .
Although there has always existed a degree of tension between online freedoms on the one hand , and abusive ( or even illegal ) behavior online on the other , at some point lawmakers may be forced to take another look at how the equation is currently balanced .
The last time we heard from Envizions , the company was just starting to get its game plan together -- but it looks like the gears are officially in motion on its Linux - based game console .
The final specs for the box now seem to be in place , with off - the - shelf components like the Athlon 64x2 5600 CPU ( clocked to 2.4GHz ) , an ATI HD 3200 graphics chipset , 2GB of DDR2 RAM , and a 120 GB hard drive filling out what is essentially a standard PC housing .
Envizions say that the console will run a modified , quick - boot distro of Fedora called Mirrors ( which can be upgraded to a beefier build named Mirrors Evolution X ) , and will feature a " cloud " service stacked with Amiga (! ) games and an Akimbo - based video service .
Beyond that , proper titles will be sold online and on SD cards for around $ 20 .
Envizions is currently taking pre-orders for the box , and say beta units will be shipped on April 10th .
Pricing for those consoles will run between $ 280 - 350 , while the final retail version can be had for $ 380 , and should be available sometime in June .
We have just two words of advice for the fledgling company : get some killer games on there fast , and please , please update your site .

Rick Warren was on the Hugh Hewitt show today , where explained that the reason why he gave the invocation at President Obama ’s Inauguration .
Warren said that he wants to have Christ like ministry , and that Jesus hung out questionable people like prostitutes and tax collectors .
Apparently in his mind Democrats are the prostitutes and tax collectors of America .
Here is the audio courtesy of Think Progress :

Here is the exchange from the transcript of the Hugh Hewitt Show :
RW : No , because as much as I want …my number one goal in life is to have a Christ - like ministry , to treat people the way Jesus did .
And Jesus hung out with prostitutes , tax collectors and all different kinds of people .
Today , he would have hung out with Democrats …
HH : And Republicans .
RW : … and Republicans , and he would have hung out with gays and with …
HH : Illegal immigrants .
RW : … Muslims and Jews and Christians .
And today , so much of the pickiness is look who he ate with , look who he associated with .
And if you ’re going to have a Christ - like ministry , you ’re going to be criticized like Christ .
I am not sure what is more unbelievable .
Is it the fact that Rick Warren would compare himself and his ministry in any way to Jesus Christ , or is that he believes that Democrats are people who are not following the word of God ?
There are millions of religious Democrats in this country .
The only differences that I can see between the religious left and right are that the left is n’t as political and self promotional as the right .
The left also is n’t as politically well organized as the religious right .
Rick Warren was trying to project a forgiving and accepting message , but he did n’t realize that most people in this country do n’t view their religion through a partisan political prism .
Attitudes like Rick Warren ’s are why bi-partisanship is impossible to have in the United States .
When members of the right teach their followers that Democrats are not acceptable in the eyes of God , they are embedding partisanship from the pulpit .
The irony of it all is that if Jesus would come back today , he would probably be a Democrat .
I think Republicans like Rick Warren need to start living by his teachings instead of warping them in exchange for fame and financial gain .

Jiangqiao Bamboo and Wood hails from China ’s Jiangxi province , where bamboo resources are plentiful .
Though the company began as a flooring company , they are now diversifying their production to include the latest in green design : bamboo keyboards .
In recent years , bamboo – a rapidly regenerating material – has gained popularity as a sturdy , sustainable alternative to wood flooring .
Currently , China produces 200,000 cubic meters annually of bamboo plywood .
[ social_buttons ]
However , the history of bamboo ’s use as an interior and even exterior material goes back way before sustainable buildings became trendy .
Native to much of South and Southwest China , bamboo was first used to make paper , calligraphy brushes , and musical instruments thousands of years ago .
For well over a century , it has been crafted into a range of household articles including chairs , baskets , mats , cutlery , and cabinets .
Bamboo – which is actually a grass – can be harvested after only four to six years of growth , much shorter than the 30 - 60 years required for comparable wood species .
Replanting is not necessary , as bamboo regenerates on its own ; and the speed at which it does so means it offers excellent erosion control .
Jiangqiao , which began manufacturing the green keyboards last October , has already received orders for 40,000 finished units , and is China ’s sole producer of bamboo keyboards .
The company says the product is as strong as its plastic equivalent .
Proof that bamboo ’s strength surpasses what its flexibility suggests lies in the fact that modern Hong Kong developers prefer bamboo over steel reinforcing rods when constructing some of the world ’s tallest skyscrapers .
Jiangqiao faced the same difficulties typical for adapting bamboo for industrial use , including keeping the bamboo keyboard frame from cracking , preventing the bamboo bottom plate from distorting and firmly fashioning the buttons with the main board .
However , the company has successfully developed ( and patented ) its formula , and also developed a bamboo mouse and USB expected to go on the market this spring .
Though Jiangqiao is not the first company to use natural resources in computer accessories , it may be the most eco-friendly .
Much of the bamboo used in the keyboards , says the company ’s general manager , is leftover scrap from bamboo floorboard manufacturing .
Combining efficiency with aesthetically pleasing design , Jiangqiao is earning a name for itself in innovation and sustainability .

China will unveil its nuclear submarines this week at an international fleet review marking the 60th anniversary of its navy , official media reported yesterday .
The first known public appearance of the craft , off the northern port of Qingdao , will underscore the growing might of the People 's Liberation Army navy and its attempts to build goodwill by increasing transparency .
The Chinese navy has gained prominence lately thanks to participation in the fleet battling pirates off the coast of Somalia - the first active mission outside the Pacific - and a confrontation with the US in the South China Sea last month .
The Chinese navy 's commander , Admiral Wu Shengli , said the celebrations , which would include 21 ships from 14 foreign countries , would show his country as a force for " peace , harmony and co-operation " at sea , the Liberation Army Daily reported .
Wu told foreign commanders yesterday that navies needed to work together to confront transnational security threats such as piracy and terrorism .
" Suspicions about China being a ' threat ' to world security are mostly because of misunderstandings and lack of understandings about China , " Wu's deputy , Vice - Admiral Ding Yiping , told the state news agency Xinhua .
" The suspicions would disappear if foreign counterparts could visit the Chinese navy and know about the true situation . "
He added : " It is not a secret that China has nuclear submarines , which are key to safeguarding our country 's national security . "
Chinese media have speculated that the government will also use the celebrations to announce more details of its plan to build an aircraft carrier , which is seen by many as emblematic of its ambitions .
The United States and governments in the region are concerned about China 's growing naval power , sea boundary disputes and rivalry for resources .
Admiral Gary Roughead , chief of US naval operations and a guest at the fleet parade , told reporters in Beijing he would use the visit to try to improve military relations , Reuters said .
" We can all look at the types of ships and the types of airplanes and the numbers of airplanes - that 's interesting and worthy of note , " he said .
" But it is how countries elect to use those capabilities , and what the purposes are that they see , and how they will use them and how they will interact with other navies .
That 's important and that 's why this dialogue is under way . "
He said Beijing had yet to specify the role an aircraft carrier would play .
" The fleet review and Somalia are being used by China to try to show that even as it projects its power it is not a threat to anyone , " said Christian Le Miere , senior analyst for Asia at defence publication Jane 's Country Risk .
He said the PLA had sought to portray itself as transparent and a responsible partner , rebuilding military - to - military links with the US .
But he added that the US and Japan would be watching warily .
" The incident in the South China Sea was a very clear indication of the fears of both sides ...
China is increasingly concerned by US monitoring of its activities and the US is increasingly concerned that the Chinese are developing longer - range blue - water capabilities , " he said .
Last month the US accused Chinese boats , including a naval vessel , of harassing the USNS Impeccable in international waters , while China said the surveillance ship should not have been operating in its " exclusive economic zone " .
The stand - off took place 75 miles south of a major naval base .
The PLA navy has more than 225,000 personnel and is thought to have as many as 70 submarines , 10 of them nuclear - powered .
It also has about 72 combat ships .
But it is continuing to invest heavily in expanding and upgrading its fleet , with much of the PLA 's hefty budget increases in recent years going to the navy .
Le Miere said China had focused on improving naval capabilities since the early 1990s as it became more confident about its land borders because of improved relations with Russia and the US , and land and air capabilities superior to those of its neighbours .
" We have seen new nuclear submarines , amphibious landing ships , fast attack craft and major surface weapons , and under the somewhat opaque ' Project 48 ' we are likely to see an aircraft carrier as well , " he added .
• This article was amended on Friday 24 April 2009 .
Due to an editing error , the original version of this article said that Chinese nuclear submarines had gained prominence in recent battles with Somali pirates .
This has been corrected .
Just in time to celebrate the fact that the PirateBay judge may have had a conflict of interest , we present to y’all the Pirate Remote .
Nothing to do with file sharing of course ( we ’re just trying to be trendily topical ) this puppy simply switches off any adjacent television while growling ‘ ahar - har - har , matey ’ or something equally menacing .
Nope , we ’re lying about that too .
Sigh. € 14.00 .
As suspected , the pirates came up with something to counter the Ninja Remote : a remote of their own .
The battle is on !
With this remote you will be able to control most , but not all , European TVs and change channel , volume , AV / TV signal , mute and on / off .
Recognition may take up to 2 minutes and involves pressing volume change and waiting until the remote sends the correct code for the current TV so that it changes ; then you have the power .
Washington — Dick Cheney became a one - of - a - kind vice president for two reasons : he cared deeply about governance , and not a bit about his future political standing .
Those same factors , for better or worse , have turned him into a one - of - a - kind former vice president .
In a sharp break with long - standing practice , Mr. Cheney has emerged as the highest - profile critic of the new administration .
Repeatedly during Mr. Obama ’s transition and his first 100 days in office , Mr. Cheney has carried his anemic favorability rating into the ring to slug it out with a successor who enjoys considerable public support on issues from the role of the vice presidency to his trademark issue of national security .
On the economy , he complained in a Fox News interview last week , “ There does n’t appear to be any limitation whatsoever in terms of the spending commitments that this administration wants to make . ”
But if Mr. Cheney seems intent on vindicating decisions he helped shape during the two terms of the Bush presidency , some Republicans prefer that he join Mr. Bush in shunning the public spotlight .
“ Generally speaking Dick ’s voice is probably not going to move the ball forward , ” one prominent Republican , Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , said .
Nonetheless , members of both parties say Mr. Cheney , with his tenacity and his insider ’s knowledge of government and politics , continues to influence the Washington debate .

Karl and Judy were so kind to continue loving their son , they write , even after he contracted AIDS — and forced taxpayers to cough up $ 250,000 for his treatment !
Now their son Randy is dead , and they ’re using his death as a cause célèbre to champion anti-gay activism .

As a kid , I discovered at a young - ish age that my parents smoked pot .
They never did it in front of me , but curious child that I was , I snooped around and found out on my own .
I was devastated because , as an 8 - year - old kid , all the propaganda told me that pot was akin to murder ( " I learned it by watching YOU ! " ) .
It was awful for me to find out that my parents were criminals !
As I got older into my teenage years , I got into the weed a bit too ; but I still held this grudge against my parents .
My mindset was that I was SUPPOSED to do it , I was a rebellious teenager .
They should have grown out of it long ago .
Funny thing is , they were n't criminals .
They were the most loving , caring , adoring parents I ever could have asked for .
They sacrificed a lot to give me and my brother private educations through high school .
He and I never could have asked for anything more .
Now that I 'm my own fully - functional adult with a great job , a wonderful boyfriend , and a hell of a lot of stability , I look back and wish that I did n't spend my childhood thinking these things about my parents .
I 'm old enough to know now that pot ?
criminal loserdom .
I hope that one day , the stigma is lifted so it can just be " something that grownups do " and kids will accept that as a fine answer .
Another writes :
I grew up in a house where my Dad smoked pot in front of me on an almost daily basis .
When I was little I did n’t really think to question what he was smoking ( he was a cigarette smoker too , and had the occasional cigar ) .
One day when I was in sixth grade , he was going to work late and was going to drop me off at school .
Before we left he called me over and explained to me that stuff he was smoking was n’t always cigarettes , it was marijuana .
I remember being a little shocked at the time thinking , " Wow , my dad smokes pot . "
He had a talk with me about how I was getting older now and that even though I would come across this stuff sooner or later , I was n’t old enough to make a responsible decision as to whether I would choose to smoke pot ( obviously he was right ; I was only 11 at the time ) .
He just told me to wait until I got out of high school to try it ( as Chef says , “ There ’s a time and place for everything and it ’s college ” ) .
Of course I had many many opportunities growing up to smoke pot if I really wanted to .
I could have taken a some of my Dad ’s and he probably would n’t have known any better .
But I respected his wishes and waited until I got into college .
I ’ve smoked pot about a dozen times or so and to be honest I did enjoy it .
But I have n’t smoked at all since I graduated from college in 2004 .
I ’ll always appreciate that my Dad treated me as an adult when it came to the subject of pot .
He did n’t try to hide it from me .
He was n’t a hypocrite like so many today who live by the motto , " Do as I say , not as I do . "
Another :
My teenage kids understand that I have smoked grass , and that the drug was ubiquitous when I was growing up , so pretty much unavoidable .
I ’ve explained to them that early on I realized that I would not excel in school if I smoked more than once or twice a month .
I do n’t talk about current use , because I think this is something that should be kept private , especially considering the current legal situation and existing social morays .
I do n’t think this makes me a hypocrite .
For the most part , I ’m very honest with my kids , and I do n’t think there is a parent on the planet that is completely open about everything they might have done in the past .
Another :
I have n't played the game of telling my kids that drugs are bad .
Like almost everyone in my generation ( I'm 53 ) I have a certain amount of experience with drugs .
When my daughters were getting close to the age when they would come into contact with drugs , I shared my experiences honestly and told them that I hoped that they would make sensible , safe decisions .
I did n't tell them to abstain , I told them to be careful .
I also asked them to be open with me and keep me informed , which for the most part they did .
That enabled me to advise them about how to stay safe .
Whether or not you feel like you can safely come out of this particular closet , you should at least be honest with your kids .
If we can't manage that , we 'll never win this battle and our kids will end up stuck in the same closet .
Incidentally , almost all of my friends are in the closet .
I 'm not , but only because I started to have a powerful negative psychic reaction to marijuana in my 40s , sort of like the stoned paranoia thing , which ruins it for me .
I miss it .
Another :
I 'm 51 .
I smoked pot several times a week from the time I was sixteen until I was about 30 .
I quit for about 10 years when my kids were young and started smoking again about 10 years ago .
I 've never smoked a cigarette in my life and rarely drink .
My kids are now in college and I smoke more frequently now that they are not home .
I have told both of them that I 've " inhaled " and they in turn have told me they have , too .
We have not had a family inhalation .
Both of my daughters asked me if their mother , whom I am happily married to for 25 years , has also smoked .
I told them that if they really want to know they should ask her .
While I 'm increasingly out of the cannabis closet , I 'm not going to out anybody else .
It is strange for me to write this , but I 'm really a model citizen .
I work productively at the small business I started 8 years ago ( I was high when I wrote the business plan ) , pay taxes , support my children , contribute to charity , and obey the law .
I have n't had so much as a traffic ticket in 15 years .
I believe very strongly in the rule of law , but the pot laws in America are so out of touch with reality that I simply ignore them .

For all of his hopes about bipartisanship , Barack Obama has the most polarized early job approval ratings of any president in the past four decades .
The 61 - point partisan gap in opinions about Obama ’s job performance is the result of a combination of high Democratic ratings for the president — 88 % job approval among Democrats — and relatively low approval ratings among Republicans ( 27 % ) .
By comparison , there was a somewhat smaller 51 - point partisan gap in views of George W. Bush ’s job performance in April 2001 , a few months into his first term .
At that time , Republican enthusiasm for Bush was comparable to how Democrats feel about Obama today , but there was substantially less criticism from members of the opposition party .
Among Democrats , 36 % approved of Bush ’s job performance in April 2001 ; that compares with a 27 % job approval rating for Obama among Republicans today .
The partisan gap in Bill Clinton ’s early days was also substantially smaller than what Obama faces , largely because Democrats were less enthusiastic about Clinton .
In early April 1993 , 71 % of Democrats approved of Clinton ’s job performance , which is 17 points lower than Obama ’s current job approval among Democrats .
Republican ratings of Clinton at that point ( 26 % ) are comparable to their current ratings of Obama today ( 27 % ) .
The growing partisan divide in presidential approval ratings is part of a long - term trend .
Going back in time , partisanship was far less evident in the early job approval ratings for both Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon .
In fact , a majority of Republicans ( 56 % ) approved of Carter ’s job performance in late March 1977 , and a majority of Democrats ( 55 % ) approved of Nixon ’s performance at a comparable point in his first term .
Imagine a wearable device that lets you physically interact with interfaces that appear in front of you on any surface , where and when you want them .
You can watch a video on your newspaper 's front page , navigate through a map on your dining table , and flick through photos on any wall .
The " Sixth Sense " system from Patti Maes ' Fluid Interfaces Group at the MIT Media Lab does all this through a prototype built from $ 300 worth of off the shelf components .
You can even take a photograph by simply holding your hand in the air and making a framing gesture .
Though the system appears to be in a state of " frankenstein " - type assemblies of webcams , projectors , mirrors , fingertip color markers and helmets it 's not hard to imagine a streamlined device that could be easily donned .
The SixthSense prototype is comprised of a pocket projector , a mirror and a camera .
The hardware components are coupled in a pendant like mobile wearable device .
Both the projector and the camera are connected to the mobile computing device in the userâ€™s pocket .
The projector projects visual information enabling surfaces , walls and physical objects around us to be used as interfaces ; while the camera recognizes and tracks user 's hand gestures and physical objects using computer - vision based techniques .
The software program processes the video stream data captured by the camera and tracks the locations of the colored markers ( visual tracking fiducials ) at the tip of the userâ€™s fingers using simple computer - vision techniques .
The movements and arrangements of these fiducials are interpreted into gestures that act as interaction instructions for the projected application interfaces .
The maximum number of tracked fingers is only constrained by the number of unique fiducials , thus SixthSense also supports multi-touch and multi-user interaction .
Patti Maes and Pranav Mistry , Fluid Interfaces Group , MIT Media Lab :
The SixthSense prototype implements several applications that demonstrate the usefulness , viability and flexibility of the system .
The map application lets the user navigate a map displayed on a nearby surface using hand gestures , similar to gestures supported by Multi- Touch based systems , letting the user zoom in , zoom out or pan using intuitive hand movements .
The drawing application lets the user draw on any surface by tracking the fingertip movements of the userâ€™s index finger .
SixthSense also recognizes userâ€™s freehand gestures ( postures ) .
For example , the SixthSense system implements a gestural camera that takes photos of the scene the user is looking at by detecting the â€˜framingâ€™ gesture .
The user can stop by any surface or wall and flick through the photos he / she has taken .
SixthSense also lets the user draw icons or symbols in the air using the movement of the index finger and recognizes those symbols as interaction instructions .
For example , drawing a magnifying glass symbol takes the user to the map application or drawing an â€˜@â€™ symbol lets the user check his mail .
The SixthSense system also augments physical objects the user is interacting with by projecting more information about these objects projected on them .
For example , a newspaper can show live video news or dynamic information can be provided on a regular piece of paper .
The gesture of drawing a circle on the userâ€™s wrist projects an analog watch .
The current prototype system costs approximate $ 350 to build .

Thanks , Sonia !
Pakistan 's government fired an official who played a key role in crafting a peace deal that has given the Taliban control of the Swat Valley as militants partially pulled backed from a neighboring area they occupied this past week .
The Taliban retreat from the Buner district back to their camps in Swat headed off what some feared was an imminent clash with the military .
But government and Taliban officials said " local " Taliban were still in Buner , just 60 miles from Islamabad .
The situation remained volatile and a growing number of Pakistani officials , foreign diplomats and analysts are saying it is only a matter of time before the Swat peace deal collapses .
In one indication that Pakistan 's leaders are beginning to question the deal , the top administrator for Swat and the surrounding areas , Syed Mohammed Javed , was fired Saturday for maintaining close contacts with a number of wanted Taliban commanders and , officials suspect , perhaps even al Qaeda 's deputy leader , Ayman al - Zawahiri , who is also wanted by the U.S .
A senior security official said Mr. Javed could face punitive action for dealing with the wanted militants .
The official did not provide any further details .
Officials said Mr. Javed was instrumental in negotiating what now appears to be a very one - sided peace deal in Swat , a one - time Alpine vacation getaway where the army has pulled back and the Taliban have been allowed to impose a harsh brand of Islamic law , prohibiting men from shaving their beards and banning women from leaving their homes without male relatives .

In a recent New Yorker , Nick Paumgarten published a lucid , entertaining essay on the financial collapse .
Titled “ The Death of Kings , ” it focuses on the hedge - fund managers , stock gurus , and private - equity wizards who reaped billions from the credit bubble .
iStock Photo
What were those people thinking ?
Turns out , Paumgarten relates that during the flush times , many in the world of finance had a “ moment of clarity , an inkling of doom ” about what was coming .
“ The sky was full of signs , ” Paumgarten writes .
For many , the awakening came while driving through some overbuilt exurb in California or Florida , or watching a commercial for a subprime lender ( “ Mortgage consultants are standing by ! ” ) , or studying a chart depicting total debt to the gross domestic product .
Paumgarten ’s tale is essentially about high - level fecklessness : people with degrees from the nation ’s finest universities , rewarded with nine - figure annual salaries , knowingly driving the global economy right over a cliff .
Paumgarten does n’t go there , but the same analysis applies to financial policymakers and regulators ; they , too , could gawk at obviously overbuilt exurbs , or wince at debt - to - GDP charts .
The whole sorry spectacle got me thinking of the global food system , the juggernaut that feeds billions every day .
It ’s not hard to make analogies with the financial sector whose rubble now lays scattered about , ready to be cleaned up on the public ’s dime .
Like the financial sector , the food system has dramatically globalized over the past generation , even as it has become increasingly concentrated ( PDF ) .
Just as traders in New York , Tokyo , and London — often employed by the same mega - banks — can make , say , the Argentine peso plunge or soar with a few keystrokes , global food commodity markets have become tightly intertwined .
Just last year , the U.S. policy of diverting massive amounts of corn to biofuel — in concert with similar European Union policy on soybeans — sparked steep increases in food prices worldwide , pushing hundreds of millions of people into hunger .
In essence , decisions made in Washington and Brussels reduced Haiti ’s urban poor to eating mud cakes .
The analogy between food and finance also extends to the concept of leverage .
During the boom , a typical Wall Street firm held a dollar in liquid assets for every 25 it used to make speculative bets in stuff like derivatives and credit default swaps .
Execs were so confident that real - estate prices go only one way — up ! — that 25 - to - one leverage seemed like a sound business model .
Paumgarten shows that many of them had doubts ; but that only makes the situation more stunning .
Whereas Wall Street ’s leverage was financial , the food industry ’s is mostly ecological and social .
( Financial leverage does play a role , as in the case of teetering , debt - gorged Pilgrim ’s Pride , the globe ’s largest chicken producer . )
Companies like Archer Daniels Midland , Cargill , and Tyson have built globe - spanning empires by taking vast amounts of cheap , monocropped corn and soy and turning it into everything from sweetener to meat to car fuel .
Mega - processors like Kraft and fast - food chains like McDonald ’s and Wendy ’s suck in these inputs and churn out cheap , ready - made meals .
These giant entities behave as if soil is an easily renewable resource , that the climate can absorb endless amounts of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide ( a synthetic fertilizer byproduct ) , and that communities and the biosphere can endlessly bear the toxic footprint of industrial meat production .
And just as in the financial world circa 2006 , signs of imminent trouble abound , discernible by anyone who dares look .
Consider just a few of the most obvious ones :
• Industrial corn and soy are the lifeblood of the industrial food system , providing livestock feed , cooking oil , sweeteners , and a dizzying array of processed additives .
They ’re also the feedstock of choice for the biofuel industry , of which food giants like ADM and Cargill form a major part .
And , they ’re massive contributors to climate change .
Industrial corn needs heavy lashings of synthetic nitrogen to reach maximum yield — and recent studies ( PDF ) suggest nitrogen fertilizers emit four to five times more nitrous oxide into the atmosphere than previously had been assumed .
Meanwhile , the expansion of soy into Brazil ’s agricultural frontier , egged on by ADM and Cargill , has led to massive deforestation in the Amazon , perhaps the globe ’s most important carbon sink .
Under the industrial - food regime , we ’re literally warming the planet bite by bite .
• Large doses antibiotics are fundamental to the industrial livestock model .
Animals crammed together in close quarters over their own waste become immune - comprimised , requiring steady doses just to stay alive .
Meat producers also favor antibiotics because they promote fast growth .
“ An estimated 70 percent of antibiotics produced in this country — nearly 13 million pounds per year — are used in animal agriculture for these nontherapeutic purposes , ” claims the Union of Concerned Scientists .
A growing body of evidence links intensive hog production with MRSA , an antibiotic resistant staph infection that kills 20,000 Americans per year — more than AIDS .
The situation with flu viruses may be even more dire .
The current swine flu strain sweeping the globe has been traced to a hog raised by a large - scale operation in North Carolina from 1998 ; and even conventional veterinary scientists have been warning for years that hog CAFOs create ideal environments for fast - evolving , species - jumping flu strains .
• Industrial - scale vegetable and fruit production relies heavily on domesticated honey bees for pollination — and commercial beekeepers have been haunted since 2006 by large die - offs .
Scientists have yet to settle on a single explanation for “ colony collapse disorder ” — but widespread insecticide use almost certainly plays a role .
One can easily imagine a rollicking New Yorker piece about the aftermath of a food - system meltdown : quotes from wistful agribiz execs about how they saw , and ignored hints of a coming calamity .
But there ’s no need to wait fearfully for that day .
Just as signs industrial food ’s fragility abound , there ’s also evidence of robust alternatives nationwide .
For 20 years , farmers markets and CSAs have grown dramatically , providing links between consumers and farmer unmediated by transnational food corporations .
In places as diverse as Woodbury County , Iowa , and Hardwick , Vermont , citizens are organizing to use municipal policy as a tool to revitalize and support local food networks .
Across the nation , municipalities are launching “ food policy councils ” — based on the theory that just as cities develop strategies for securing sufficient water and regulating growth , they also need to think about nurturing their foodshed .
And in inner-city Chicago and Milwaukee , Growing Power and the Institute for Community Resource Development are putting the lie to the idea that low - income people tend to eat industrial food because they like it better .
These groups — along with Brooklyn ’s East New York Farms and Added Value , Oakland ’s People ’s Grocery , and others — are thriving as they bring fresh food to neighborhoods that too often only have access to ill - stocked corner stores .
All of this activity , vibrant and promising as it is , produces a small fraction of the food consumed in the United States — likely less than 3 percent .
Unlike the industrial food system , it ’s disaggregated , decentralized , and unsubsidized by the federal government .
Yet these shadow food systems represent the best hope we have as Big Food lumbers toward disaster .
Here is where the analogy to the financial system offers some hope .
Commenting on how difficult it was for most people not to get swept up in the bubble economy , Paumgarten writes : “ The sad fact is that betting against the global financial system requires more than pluck ; you need to be a participant .
Most of the mechanisms in place for the implementation of pessimism are known only to the members of the guild . ”
In other words , nearly anyone could have seen that the U.S. economy had entered a precarious bubble phase .
But you pretty much had to have been running a hedge fund to , say , make money by betting against the value of collatoralized - debt obligations .
Food is different .
There are multiple ways for individuals and communities to get involved with alternative - food efforts .
And unlike shorting securities like a Wall Street “ bear , ” betting on alternative food expresses optimism , not pessimism .
There are several stories that are driving this discussion .
This video is one of them .
Thousands of you have watched this video of a Pakistani girl being flogged for a relationship she ’s alleged to have had .
The punishment was administered in the Swat Valley which has recently come under Sharia law in a move to placate the Taliban .
2 . There ’s been fierce debate of a new law in Afghanistan which would give a husband the legal right to have sex with his wife every four days .
The law ’s now being reviewed , but it has been supported by people who have sympathy with the Taliban ’s interpretation of Islam .
3 . Two ultra-Orthodox Jewish newspapers have altered a photo of Israel ’s new cabinet and removed two female cabinet ministers .
One replaced them with men , the other left the space blank .
Printing pictures of woman is seen as a violation of female modesty .
Add to that the Catholic Church ’s stance on abortion , and any number of examples from Saudi Arabia ( women not being allowed to drive being one ) , and some of you argue that religion in its many forms places obstacle after obstacle in front of women being treated fairly .
Do you agree ?
Or is that to misunderstand how some religions view women and men as different but equal ?

Breaking the Banksy :
The first interview with the world 's most elusive artist
' I 'll be lucky to break even , ' says Banksy .
' It 's not cheap to rent a road ' ...
By Lee Coan
That ’s my mum , ’ says Banksy .
He ’s pointing at a googly - eyed stencil portrait of an old lady .
‘ Do n’t tell her I gave her funny eyes , though .
It ’s not her most flattering portrait . ’
Before I continue , I should clarify : officially this man is n’t Banksy .
But unofficially , he ’s so Banksy I want to slice off his face and put it on eBay .
From my past encounters I ’m 99 per cent sure it ’s him .
He ’s the only man in this dirty , poisonous little road beneath London ’s Waterloo Station that nobody refers to by name .
They just come up to him , ask a quick question and then scuttle off .
He ’s tall and well built with slightly shabby hair .
His voice has a slight West Country twang lurking behind an otherwise London tone .
We met before , back in 2006 , when Banksy was flogging his art to the Hollywood elite for six - figure sums at an LA show that centred on a live painted elephant .
On that night I shared a urinal with Keanu Reeves , had my G&T pilfered by Jude Law , chatted to Brad about where Angelina was going to put their new Banksy statue , and crucially helped stop the four - ton Indian elephant creating the biggest Hollywood bloodbath of all time .
Having been fed 50 bags of M&M ’s and a few litres of Red Bull , Nelly was understandably tetchy at being blocked out of his ‘ luxury elephant trailer ’ by Banksy ’s broken - down lorry .
In one of the most surreal hours of my life , I helped the artist move his stricken truck , before giving his crew a lift back to their hotel in a convertible Mustang I ’d hired .
From that point I was ‘ in ’ .
Which is why I ’m here now .
‘ It was great fun out there , ’ he laughs about our time in LA .
‘ OK , there ’s no elephant this time , but in a way this is much bigger , the biggest thing we ’ve ever done .
It ’s so vast , and every time you walk to the end you notice that something else has changed . ’
He ’s covered in paint , yet claims not to be working today .
When he speaks , everyone listens .
Point a camera near him and he runs .
Looking askance at my photographer , who ’s lurking , he politely reminds me , ‘ No photos . ’
That ’s fine .
We ’re not here to blow his cover .
A new Banksy mural ' One Nation Under CCTV ' painted next to a CCTV camera at a Post Office yard in the West End .
Described as Britain ’s Andy Warhol , undercover graffiti guerrilla Banksy is not only our most important working artist , but one of the world ’s most elusive criminals .
In January , a wall defaced by his spray can sold for £ 208,100 .
Everyone from Jude Law to Brangelina has his politically charged stencils on their walls – and I ’m spending a morning watching him create his latest masterpiece , an entire London street graffitied in secrecy and not due to be unveiled until tonight .
Despite countless attempts by the police , his fans and the media , Banksy has somehow managed to keep his identity under wraps since he first became famous around eight years ago .
The story goes that his real identity is so secret even Banksy ’s parents do n’t realise who their son is ; his agent tells me , ‘ They think he ’s a painter and decorator who ’s done very well for himself . ’
I ’m not sure if I believe that , but I do know the cat - and - mouse game he plays with those trying to find him is both perfectly executed and as tongue - in - cheek as some of his wittier artworks .
The New Yorker , the BBC , Esquire and London ’s Evening Standard have all attempted exposés on him , and all have failed .
When the LA Times tried to find out who he was , Banksy unleashed stand - up comedian Simon Munnery as his ‘ lawyer ’ to confuse matters .
This , despite the fact that Munnery had been drinking heavily all night .
His 30 - minute rant baffled them enough to make them give up on their scoop .
Proof of just how far the artist is willing to go to guard his secret .
His agent and right - hand man Steve Lazarides once told me even he is n’t 100 per cent sure of Banksy ’s identity .
CCTreeV at last month 's Cans Festival
Alarming , considering Lazarides owns the artist ’s website and gallery and controls all access to him – if you want to buy a £ 60,000 Banksy - defaced Mona Lisa , Steve is the man you call .
‘ I get a note telling me which B&Q car park he ’s going to leave his latest box of his canvases in , ’ Lazarides once told me .
‘ I collect them and leave him a cheque in their place . ’
Though he would n’t tell me who the cheque was payable to , he was deadly serious , convincingly baffled by the arrangement himself .
Considering Lazarides was previously a West Country chicken - plucker who took photos of Bristol ’s graffiti scene in his spare time , it ’s not a bad deal , and one he ’d be a fool to blow .
It was Lazarides who arranged for me to be part of this top - secret paint - bombing .
No other member of the media even knew about it , let alone got asked to attend , and my invitation was suitably mysterious : just a two - word text reading ‘ Leake Street ’ .
Having met Banksy before , I know this means I have to get to Leake Street immediately .
It ’s 5am .
I find the kind of place urban foxes go to die , filled with junkies and litter .
To be honest , I ’m a little nervous .
This , after all , is the man who unleashed 164 live rats on art critics at his 2005 show in London ’s Westbourne Grove .
On arrival , I see Banksy ’s publicist , who I met in LA , loitering in front of what looks like a building site .
A sign on a blue plywood temporary barrier reads ‘ Transport for London : road closed for vital maintenance work ’ .
It ’s a fake sign .
In truth , Banksy has rented the entire road for six months , and has created a monster behind the faux barrier .
' Space Girl and Bird ' sold at auction last year for £ 288 , 000
I ’m itching to see what it is .
As the publicist bangs on the plywood to be let in , she hands me a piece of paper
On it there ’s a note from Banksy himself .
It says , ‘ Graffiti does n’t always spoil buildings .
In fact , it ’s the only way to improve a lot of them .
In the space of a few hours with a couple of hundred cans of paint , I ’m hoping we can transform a dark , forgotten filth pit into an oasis of beautiful art – in a dark , forgotten filth pit . ’
Fantastic .
A chain rattles , a padlock is removed and a 6ft , bald security guard swings the plywood barrier open .
I ’m in .
Beyond the temporary tarpaulin doors , the entire street is rammed with dozens of the planet ’s finest stencil vandals , all busy at work .
Paint is dripping off every wall .
Stencils of rats and Boris Johnson litter the floor ; men in hoods are hanging off ladders with cans .
The fog of aerosol fumes is enough to give me an instant migraine .
Every great stencil street artist on Earth is here .
Someone tells me Banksy simply posted out first - class plane tickets and an address to 39 vandals around the world .
That was three days ago .
‘ Most people could n’t make something this amazing work in three days , but everyone came , ’ the London - based graffitist Pure Evil tells me .
Banksy artwork on Essex Road , Islington , London .
The piece shows children pledging their allegiance to supermarket giant Tesco .
If the police were to burst in , they ’d have a field day – these are some of the most prolific vandals in the world .
Notorious ‘ steampunk ’ artist Paul Insect rushes past me , Portugal ’s Vhils is autographing walls and a slightly scruffy - looking bloke in his mid-thirties is hiding his face behind a black - and - white scarf .
I walk up to the main man and thrust out my hand in a hopeful sort of way .
He smiles , shakes it and then yanks up his scarf even more .
Banksy ’s role in what he ’s calling the ‘ Cans Festival ’ is more executive than anything else , as he moves around directing various pieces .
I have interrupted him at work on a sculpture called ‘ CCTreeV ’ involving dozens of fake security cameras .
Before that , he was busy putting a Noddy car up on bricks .
When he arrived at Leake Street , Banksy ’s biggest worry was the homeless men living there .
‘ I did n’t want to just kick them out , ’ he says .
‘ Firstly it was their home , and secondly they were quite scary .
' We offered to put them up in a YMCA , but they just said , ‘ Do n’t worry about it ’ , and moved on to somewhere else .
' We ’ve got this for six months , at which point Eurostar have told us they want it returned in the exact state we got it .
So we ’ll have to go find those guys and bring them back , I guess . ’
They ’ll also have to painstakingly urinate on the walls and bring back all the used needles .
It seems a shame , to say the least .
‘ This street must be worth millions now , ’ I point out , remembering that earlier this year one of Banksy ’s quick urban paint jobs sold for £ 950,000 at Sotheby ’s , New York .
But the point of the Cans Festival is that it ’s not for profit ; this time , nothing is for sale .
‘ We ’re only flogging programmes for £ 3 , and we ’ll be very lucky to break even , ’ Banksy states proudly .
‘ It ’s been quite an expensive project – we ’ve flown artists in from 11 countries , and it ’s not cheap to rent a road !
A wall adorned with a mural by graffiti artist Banksy has sold on EBay for 208,100 pounds ( $ 407,000 )
' We could have put prints up for sale and made a fortune , but that ’s not what this is about .
We wanted people to be able to come here and have a go themselves . ’
And when they ’ve finished , they ’re invited to take away whatever they like .
‘ We did a show where we gave away free canvases to kids a couple of years ago , and this is just a progression from that .
We ’re giving away a piece of wall instead of the canvas . ’
I ask if I can have a go at stencilling .
‘ Yeah , ’ he says .
‘ Are you any good ? ’
I ’m not .
My graffiti skills were wisely retired after I sprayed ‘M Khan is bent ’ on a skateboard ramp in my youth .
But there ’s one empty patch I have my eye on .
I ask if I can have a go with one of the ‘ emulsion hydrants ’ ( fire extinguishers filled with paint , used to create giant splatters to stencil upon ) .
Sadly , that patch is being reserved for French graffiti legend Blek le Rat , who wo n’t arrive until tomorrow .
Banksy is a huge fan .
‘ Every time I think I ’ve painted something slightly original , I find out that Blek le Rat has done it , too , ’ he says , ‘ only Blek did it 20 years earlier . ’
At this point he starts to look twitchy .
My photographer is struggling to resist taking photos and is edging ever closer .
Even more worrying , the world ’s media are knocking at the door .
Time to leave …
‘ You ’re coming to our party tonight , are n’t you ? ’
Banksy asks as I shake his hand and say farewell .
I ’d only been half - invited to the grand unveiling up until this point , but now I ’m definitely coming .
‘ Great , ’ he says .
‘ I ’ll see you later . ’

He wo n’t .
As I walk out , the mass of journalists who have now descended is suffocating .
The Sky News helicopter is chopping overhead , eager hacks in suits and jaded art critics in hemp trousers are craning their necks and a CNN reporter thrusts a camera in my face .
‘ Can you go live in five minutes ? ’ asks the CNN man , as his sound lady starts feeling up my jumper for suitable spots to pin a radio mic .
Me , live to the world ?
Dear God , no .
‘ Just tell them what you ’ve been creating in there , ’ he says , and it dawns on me : this man thinks he ’s got the art - world scoop of the century .
He thinks I ’m Banksy .
Meanwhile , I see the real Banksy hugging the few hooded men who are still painting , and then he just walks out – fast , but bold as brass .
He wo n’t be returning to the scene of the crime .
By the time I come back to Banksy ’s street later that night , it ’s huge news across the planet and has turned into a private street party .
Invitation - only , of course , and we ’re still the only media in there .
Unlike past Banksy parties I ’ve attended , this one has nothing to do with flogging paintings to overly rich people .
Nothing is for sale , kids are swinging on smashed - up cars and family and friends make up most of the numbers .
But there are also a lot of ‘ London cool ’ types sneering at the pieces .
I ’m not sure how or why they got in .

You can sense the huge popularity of their former favourite is getting to them , and they ’re clearly unhappy they ca n’t buy the pieces this time around .
‘ I tell you what , ’ laughs Banksy ’s publicist , ‘ if a grenade went off in here , there ’d be a hell of a lot of dead a*******s.’
She has a point .
Ten o’clock the following morning is much more in the Banksy spirit .
The ‘a******* s’ are gone and the street genuinely comes to life .
By the end of the three - day event , 28,500 people will have entered the street ( queuing for up to an hour in the blazing heat ) , 691 of them bringing their own stencils and adding to the art , just as Banksy wanted .
Blek le
Rat is here and busy at work – spraying an image of a homeless man in a style so familiar you ’d be forgiven for thinking it ’s a Banksy .

He ’s less political than the Englishman , but just as talented , and arguably more important on the street - art scene .
I take the opportunity to buttonhole him .
‘ Banksy is a very angry man and I love that , ’ explains Blek as he sprays , in a soft Parisian accent .
‘ People say he copies me , but I do n’t think so .
I ’m the old man , he ’s the new kid , and if I ’m an inspiration to an artist that good , I love it .
I feel what he is doing in London is similar to the rock movement in the Sixties .
London is the most exciting city in the world , and it ’s because of the revolutionary artists transforming your city .
You are very lucky . ’
Ironically , Blek says he arrived late due to the huge popularity he ’s now enjoying , thanks to Banksy .
‘ People want to know me now …
I have a major book deal with the biggest publishers in the world .
I have waited 30 years for this .
It ’s only today that my street art has become big news , and that ’s thanks to people saying Banksy is inspired by me . ’
As Blek and a few dozen others concentrate on their painting , the rest of the punters seem hell - bent on destroying the place .
Pieces are kicked , moved , stolen – and security encourage it .
You certainly do n’t get that at the Tate .

A tunnel in south London has been transformed into an exhibition space by stencil graffiti artist Banksy
‘ They ’ll be here with angle grinders in the end , ’ says one of Banksy ’s people as I catch his eye near the end of the three - day extravaganza .
As I consider hiring one myself , I recall Banksy ’s words about promising Eurostar they ’d return the street in the exact state they ’d found it .
That already seems like a promise London ca n’t let Banksy keep .
Be it due to angle grinders or Banksy ’s scrubbing brush , it ’d be a tragedy if this new Leake Street vanished .
Once the dirtiest corner of central London , it has been transformed from a street nobody dared walk down into the most talked - about stretch of Tarmac in Britain .
What ’s more , it has n’t cost anyone ( apart from a petty criminal from Bristol ) a single penny .
Love or hate Banksy ’s art , you ’ve got to respect that .
I return to Leake Street a few days later , when the camera - phone - clutching hordes have vanished and the tramps have moved back in , their grubby old patch of pavement now one of the most valuable properties in the capital .
I reach into my pocket and pull out a scrunched - up piece of paper .
It ’s Banksy ’s note : ‘ I ’m hoping we can transform a dark , forgotten filth pit into an oasis of beautiful art – in a dark , forgotten filth pit . ’
For a second I think it ’s rather poignant .
But then a hugely depressing realisation hits me : if only I ’d got him to sign the thing , it ’d be worth a fortune …

A Geometric Approach to the Unification of Symbolic Structures and Neural Networks
A pair of scientists from Huddersfield University have discovered that racing games cause more agitation and aggression in players than shooters .
Rather than using their time to find a cure for cancer or an alternative source of renewable energy , Dr Simon Goodson and Sarah Pearson monitored 30 people as they played three Xbox 360 games - Project Gotham Racing , an unnamed first - person shooter and " a 3D table tennis game " .
Physical changes to the players ' heart rate , breathing and so on were monitored , along with their mental responses such as aggresssion before and after the gaming session .
The scientists found that PGR caused the greatest change in heart rate and brain activity , while the FPS caused the smallest change .
" Previous researchers have made sweeping generalisations about the nature of videogames .
This study is one of the first to use one of the latest games consoles that have a much higher level of realism , " said the boffins .
" Surprisingly the results showed that the driving game made participants more agitated and aggressive than the game with graphic violence .
Given the high levels of realism in modern games a re-evaluation of the relationship between videogames and violence is needed . "
Goodson and Pearson 's findings will be revealed at the British Psychological Society Annual Conference , which begins today at Brighton 's Holiday Inn .
Might pop down .
Check out the conference programme for the full rundown .
We 're particularly looking forward to the talk by P. Chassy of the University of Toulouse : " The purpose of the study was to quantify the mistakes that chess players of various levels of expertise make in ecological situations .
The quality of 311,722 moves made by 8,000 chess players was assessed . "

From your own feet to two wheels , and from four wheels on pavement to the shinkansen ( bullet train ) that races on rails or domestic airline flights , your transportation options in Japan run the gamut .
You ’ve got your plane reservation and are on your way to Japan and now the question becomes how to get around once you are here .
Almost everyone has heard about the vast and efficient trains systems in Japan but there are other means of transportation that you should consider when traveling from place to place .
The country has come along way since the days of rickshaws , horse drawn carriages and samurai on horseback !
( Read more about the History of transportation in Japan )
From traveling cross country to moving about in the cities you will find getting around in Japan a lot easier once you understand your various options .
Shinkansen ( Bullet Train )
Many private railways exist throughout Japan but the predominant company serving the country is Japan Railways Group , better know as JR .
From Hokkaido to Kyushu , JR offers service in all regions of Japan , with the exception of Okinawa .
If you are planning to move around the country when you visit consider a Japan Rail Pass which can only be purchased outside of Japan for seven , fourteen , or twenty - one day periods .
A Japan Rails
Pass offers travel on most lines , JR busses and ferries throughout the country .
If you are already in Japan , consider one of the regional Japan Rail Passes that can be purchased within the country .
If you are only making a a return trip from one place to another the Japan Rail Pass may not be an economical option for you and you may want to consider booking a single trip on the shinkansen .
The JR East Shinkansen Reservation system can be used to make a reservation but you will need to register as a member ( free of charge ) during the reservation process .
A credit card and e-mail address will be required for membership .
Review the map of the service areas and the timetable to plan your trip .
This reservation system is intended primary for people entering Japan via Narita Airport ( just outside of Tokyo ) as tickets can only be picked up at major JR East Stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area and the Kanto , Tohoku , and some parts of the Chubu region .
Tickets cannot be picked up in Nagoya , Kyoto , Osaka , Hiroshima , Fukuoka , or Sapporo .
One of the best resources for train travel in Japan is Hyperdia .
This system allows users to search train timetables across Japan in English and includes approximately 10,000 stations .
Highway Buses
Japan also operates a network of highway busses that are a more economical travel solution that the shinkansen but will make your journey significantly longer , often overnight .
Information of Highway Busses in Japan can be bound at Japan Bus Web along with a searchable database providing pick - up and drop off points , travel time and fare information .
For travel on JR Busses be sure search their highway bus timetable for similar information .
Another company offering long haul bus transportation in Japan is 123bus.
net .
Air Travel
Japan has a number of air carriers that offer travel within Japan .
Regular fares are often more expensive than those for train travel but discounts can be found .
Consider a Japan Airpass or consult with a travel agent to learn more about air travel options within Japan .
Public Transportation in Major Japanese Cities
The public transportation system in Japan includes a combination of subway systems , local train lines and busses .
This is often the most economical and convenient way to explore the major cities of Japan .
In most major cities the subway system or local train lines are easier to use than city buses for those with limited or no Japanese language ability .
English signage is often posted and bilingual announcements on major tourist routes are common in lager cities .
Taking the bus can be more challenging as it is often hard to find English information for bus routes and timetables .
However , since train lines criss - cross most major cities you may never have a need to take a city bus .
If you do , check for information or ask for guidance at a local tourism office or from your hotel concierge .
Use these links to assist you as you make your way around on public transportation :

Keep in mind that public transportation in Japan does not not operate on a 24 hour schedule .
Most trains and busses stop running around midnight , or earlier in some cases , so be sure to ask about this if you are planning evening outings .
Taxis
While taxis are often the most expensive transportation option , that may not always be the case and taxis should be considered especially when traveling with a group , young children or older people who may have a hard time getting around .
Most taxis accommodate up to four passengers but larger taxis are available but not common .
Taxis are readily available at most train stations and can be easily hailed on busier streets in most Japanese cities .
The base fare for most taxis is Y710 ( around USD 7 ) and that includes the first 2 kilometers .
After that time and distance charges apply at a rate of approximately Y100 for each half a kilometer .
Rates can increase late in the evening after the trains and busses have stopped running .
If you plan on taking a taxi , a red light indicates an available taxi while green indicates one that is taken .
Taxis in Japan have automatic doors that are operated by the driver and it is frowned upon to open or close the door as a passenger .
For short trips with 3 - 4 people , taking a taxi can actually be cheaper than a train or bus .
Bicycles
In every corner of Japan you will find people of bikes .
Second to walking , it is the most common form of transportation in Japan .
Bicycles can get you to your local market , the train station and beyond .
Most people in Japan own at least one bicycle and a row of parked bicycles is a common sight .
For those visiting some cities offer bicycle rentals and even tours for you to take advantage of – it ’s a fun way to move around a city and offers more flexibility that other modes of transportation .
Check out Cycle Tokyo !
for a list of bike rental locations in Tokyo or contact them about guided rides in the city .
Bicycle rentals in other areas of Japan :
Kyoto Cycling Tour Project
Mujirushi Ryohin Bicycle Rental ( Kyoto )
Kamakura Bicycle Rental ( scroll down the page )
Niigata Bicycle Rental
Suwa City ( Nagano Prefecture ) Rental Bicycle
Rental Bike Apro ( Okinwawa )
This list is not all inclusive so be sure to check for with the local tourism office or your hotel concierge to find out if there is a bike rental shop near you in Japan .
On Foot
You will do a lot of walking in Japan and commuting from one place to another will almost certainly involve stretching your legs .
Your walk may be as short as a minute from the bus stop to the shopping mall or restaurant or it could be fifteen minutes or more from the train station to a temple or other sightseeing destination .
Comfortable footwear is essential when traveling around Japan so be sure to come prepared and consider leaving your high heels at home – your feet will thank you !
Getting Around in Japan
Getting around in Japan is fun and relatively easy even if you do n’t speak the language – with good planning and knowledge of your transportation options , you will find that moving around the country is a lot less stressful than you may have thought .

Psychologists and neurologists invest considerable effort in the study of working memory .
In terms of information retention , there is a difference between long - term memory , which is affected in diseases such as Alzheimer 's , and short - term or working memory , which allows us to make immediate decisions or structure a discourse .
This more ephemeral memory is affected in diseases such as schizophrenia and depression , although a cause - effect relationship has not been established .
People with a higher working - memory capacity score higher on intelligence tests and , for this reason , it is thought that it may be intimately linked to people 's cognitive ability .
A study by IDIBAPS uses computational systems neurobiology models and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans to show that there are two parts of the cerebral cortex with highly differentiated roles implicated in this type of memory .
The results of the study were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , in an article headed by Dr. Albert Compte of the Systems Neuroscience team of the Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer ( IDIBAPS ) , and with Fredrik Edin as the first author .
This study was carried out in collaboration with two other laboratories of the Karolinska Institute , Stockholm , led by professors Torkel Klingberg and Jesper Tegnér .
Thanks to complex computer algorithms , it is possible to simulate a virtual network in which a large number of neurons interact .
These models can simulate the functioning of the structures in our brains .
According to the computer model published in PNAS , when the working memory needs to be increased , the prefrontal cortex reinforces the activation of the parietal cortex , in which the information is temporarily stored .
A brief stimulus that reaches the parietal cortex generates a reverberating activation that maintains a subpopulation active , while inhibitory interactions with neurons further away ( lateral inhibition ) prevents activation of the entire network .
This lateral inhibition is also responsible for limiting the mnemonic capacity of the parietal network .
The reinforcement of the parietal cortex by the prefrontal cortex prevents its inhibition , thereby temporarily improving working memory .
To verify this hypothesis , 25 healthy individuals carried out simple visual - memory tests while inside a functional magnetic resonance scanner .
The differences in their ability to complete the exercises were linked to the intensity of activation of the prefrontal cortex and to their interconnection with the parietal cortex .
The IDIBAPS and Karolinska researchers thus confirmed the hypothesis formulated based on the computer model .
The more the prefrontal cortex is activated , the greater the capacity of the parietal cortex for retaining short - term visual information - an indicator of working - memory capacity .
This study explains many diverse results that have been obtained in recent years in psychology and neuroimaging studies on working memory .
This is an innovative view of the neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive control and opens up new lines of research .
Clinical studies will be needed to determine whether the stimulus of the prefrontal cortex , or its training by means of memory exercises and games , can have an effect on diseases in which working memory is damaged , such as depression or schizophrenia .

I am teaching a technical course on the popular and ubiquitous version control system , Subversion , this Monday .
I thought it might be fun to give my class a little “ extra credit ” reading from the O’Reilly book , Beautiful Code .
In it , one of the original authors of Subversion , Karl Fogel , shares what he considers to be the most beautiful internal design within the codebase : the SVN delta editor .
Though this API is not directly used in doing Subversion development , I thought it might be cool for students to have a deeper understanding of the thought that went into SVN ’s codebase .
But when trying to print up some copies of the chapter for the class , I got more than I bargained for …
I highly recommend the entire book .
It is not so much a book about beautiful code as about passionate and opinionated programmers and their tastes .
But this is a good thing .
It was one of the few books about software that I have read in the last decade or so that actually gave me entirely positive feelings about my profession .
There is so much raw creativity and thought captured in these few essays .
What Brian Kernighan finds beautiful is entirely different from what Matz or simonpj find beautiful .
And that ’s the thing about a fundamentally creative craft like software .
You put five software engineers in a room with a piece of code , and you ’re lucky if you come out with only six different opinions about it .
It ’s like art , or writing .
Taste matters .
I do n’t recommend people read Beautiful Code to try to imitate some of the code described therein .
Instead , I recommend you read it as a sociological or psychological study of what makes proud and bright software engineers tick .
For example , for Kernighan it is the simplicity and minimalism that is embodied in UNIX .
For Matz , it is the notion that the programming language should be as syntactically flexible as our real languages are .
For simonpj , it ’s that complicated can be made easy , given the right abstractions .
And for Jon Bentley , in one of the more thought - provoking essays in the book , beauty and elegance was only perceived as the size of his code shrank .
The essay about the SVN Delta Editor not only illuminates the internals of SVN , but also illustrates the social dimension to software engineering and design .
It is a story about programmers , debating an API , producing it , and then putting it into practice .
It is about give and take , and an unteachable skill in problem size and complexity reduction .
All this in C !
There was a period of time in university where I actually programmed in C full - time , so I have a lot of respect for the elegance with which they crafted this powerful API .
C gives you few tools ( like OO or explicit interfaces ) for doing this kind of work ; they had to work in spite of the language ’s features and plan carefully .
I have about twenty students in my class , so I was going to print up one copy and get it copied and stapled at a local print shop .
( See note on copyright below . )
I opened up my ebook PDF of Beautiful Code with acroread on UNIX .
I navigated to the right chapter and realized that I wanted to print just that single chapter .
I always remember being annoyed whenever I had to do this , for a number of reasons .
PDF ebooks sometimes lack the proper “ bookmark ” information to navigate to the right section to print Since ebooks were once print copies , they tend to have page numbers at the bottom of each page .
But since the ebook itself has a different page numbering scheme , all sorts of psychic dissonance occurs .
You navigate to page 30 ( in the print copy ) but have to note that it ’s actually page 42 in the ebook .
You then navigate to page 45 ( in the print copy ) but have to note that it ’s actually 57 in the ebook .
OK , now I know what I need to print … I think .
So now I have to enter one of those print ranges in the “ Print ” dialog .
Is it 30 - 42 ?
No , wait , it ’s 42 - 45 …
I mean , 42 - 57 — that ’s it !
Is that inclusive or exclusive ? 🙂
Oh , my …
It ’s really not that bad , and it ’s only an occasional annoyance , but it ’s always there .
I ’m sure you know what I ’m talking about .
I had recently upgraded to acroread and noticed that the UI was all spiffed up .
And I noticed that this ebook had the right metadata for the bookmarks .
I thought to myself , “ Would n’t it be nice if acroread supported printing a chapter ? ” I right - clicked on the first entry in the chapter bookmark and was astonished .
Lo and behold , my feature existed !
( See the image to the right . )
I clicked the “ Print Pages … ” button with a bit of discomfort .
I do n’t trust software too often , and am always suspicious when I find a feature I did n’t expect to be there .
It ’s like my inner programmer is saying , “ Yea , right — too good to be true . ”
A few minutes later , my chapter was printed .
I looked it over , and brought it with my other materials to the local print shop .
One hour later , I picked up my copies and brought them home to look them over .
I noticed something very strange .
Instead of my copies containing pages 42 - 57 , they contained pages 42 , 43 , 46 , 51 , 55 , and 57 .
Damn it .
There did n’t seem to be much of a rhyme or reason to the pages that were selected .
What kind of sequence was this ?
I felt that there must be some pattern , some fibonacci - like , non-obvious sequence that applied to these pages .
I suspected the first , and obvious , culprit : that the printer had made a mistake .
Maybe it ’s a human error .
But then I looked over my original and indeed , the original only had those pages .
Not a human error .
I thought to myself , “ How is this possible ? ”
Of course , I ’ve probably given you enough information that you ’ve already figured it out .
Especially if you ’re a programmer .
We ’re just wired to think this way .
But in case you have n’t figured it out , I ’ll indulge you .
When I went back into acroread , tracing back my steps , I noticed something about that menu item I clicked .
It did n’t say Print chapter .
Instead , it said , Print pages .
Now , conceptually that seems like a small distinction , but I picked up on it .
I started to think like a programmer , rather than a user .
This function with a for loop emerged from the program and hovered above it , almost magically .
It said :
def print_pages ( self , selected ) : to_print = [ ] for bookmark in selected .
self_and_bookmarked_children ( ) : to_print .
append ( bookmark .
page ( ) ) PrintSubsystem .
queue_job ( to_print ) def print_pages ( self , selected ) : to_print = [ ] for bookmark in selected.self_and_bookmarked_children ( ) : to_print.append(bookmark.page ( ) ) PrintSubsystem.queue_job(to_print )
Then I realized the pattern in the pages it picked .
There was no pattern .
This was a beautiful little bug .
A butterfly .
You see , within the narrow world of this Print Pages function , the “ feature ” works as expected .
But from a user ’s perspective , it makes absolutely no sense .
Rather than printing everything from that bookmark to the next bookmark at the same level ( that is , rather than printing a chapter ) , it printed each individual page that happened to be physically bookmarked ( or ‘ sub - bookmarked ’ ) in the PDF , at or below that level .
This resulted in a bunch of pages being printed that happened to be the pages on which subsections began .
But this left out most of the chapter , somewhat randomly .
The worst traits of our profession come out when it is at its least social .
I have no doubt that this function that prints these pages was written by a single programmer in a windowless room , without any peer review , pair programming , or other check on his logic .
I am sure that he was given the narrow and ill - defined requirement to enable an action to “ print bookmark pages ” .
He needed to think , but instead , he decided to code .
And coding got “ it ” done , for some very weird value of “ it ” .
He was probably under time pressure .
But one thing is certain to me : he was alone .
No two programmers , debating the design and implementation of this feature , would let each other make this mistake .
The behavior it exhibited truly caught me by surprise .
Strange as it sounds , I admired how easily I had been duped by this feature .
The human error — the anti-social error — made by that programmer exhibited an odd and enigmatic computer behavior .
A human inelegance created a strange sort of cruel machine elegance .
I found it ironic that in trying to print a chapter about beautiful design from a book called Beautiful Code , I came across this beautiful bug .
I call the bug beautiful because it managed to fool me , to get me to suffer its wrath while thinking I was getting some convenience .
It exhibited behavior that challenged me to identify a pattern , where there was none .
It was so clever , it even cost me money ( the printing charges ) .
And even though I was a discerning programmer — skeptical of the feature , and so unsure of the software ’s operation that I checked the output , albeit too briefly — this little bug managed to outsmart me .
My students will have to live without the chapter , or read it online on their own .
I ’m not upset about it .
There can be beauty , even in failure .
It would be no exaggeration to say that biology has entered the era of the - ome .
It started with the study of the genome , which identified all the DNA contained in the cells of a given species .
From there , the availability of DNA chips allowed researchers to study the transcriptome , which is comprised of the portions of the genome that are made into an RNA copy .
The obvious next step was to look at how much of the transcriptome was made into proteins , making proteomics an inevitability .
In the view of the advocates of proteomics , the field should provide a far more accurate perspective of what 's happening inside a cell .
But proteins do n't lend themselves to any sort of convenient sequencing , and the proteome often contains a set of closely related proteins produced by alternate RNA transcripts and chemical modifications of the proteins themselves .
Proteomics , as a result , has had a bit of an awkward start .
To explore the reasons why , a consortium called the Human Proteome Organization sent a sample of 20 known proteins to 27 different proteomics labs ; only seven identified them all , and only one accurately picked out all the information they should have .
A paper describing the problems , which ranged from basic chemistry to analysis algorithms , was released by Nature Methods yesterday .
All 27 labs shared a common general approach to proteomics .
The first step in the process is to partially separate the mixture of proteins by size and charge .
This is accomplished by using a current to force them through a three - dimensional mesh of fibers in an acrylamide gel , which provides resistance proportional to a protein 's size .
This essentially splits a single sample up into many smaller ones , each containing a small subset of the original mix of proteins .
The next trick is identifying the proteins in each of these samples .
The method of choice is mass spectroscopy .
The proteins are chopped into smaller fragments using an enzyme called trypsin ; these fragments are then vaporized , ionized , and shot through an electric field .
This separates the fragments very precisely according to their mass , which depends on the sequence of the protein fragment .
It 's possible to calculate which known proteins contain a fragment of that mass ( often , there 's only one ) , allowing the identity of the protein to be determined .
So , in this case , the gel step should have largely separated the 20 proteins ; trypsin digestion should have then created a total of 22 fragments that are in the ideal range for mass spec identification .
But , in all but one of the 27 labs , various things went wrong , and the authors of the paper did their best to figure out why .
Part of the issue was that , despite the fact that all of them used a similar general approach , there were lots of devils in the details , from the precise chemistry of individual steps to the equipment used and the analysis performed .
So , for example , a number of the labs had issues with protein fragments that contained cysteine because of sample processing issues .
Others performed procedures that led to contamination by a protein called BSA , which is often used during the calibration of the equipment ; a number picked up keratins from human skin contaminants or the trypsin used in sample processing .
Choice of equipment also played a role ; labs that used something called a Fourier transform ion cyclotron tended to have better data to work with .
But the big problem was n't the processing ; the authors of the paper obtained the raw data from the labs that received samples in order to analyze the data themselves .
That 's where the fun started , as " the initially deposited data had several problems , including incomplete files , proprietary software formats , and screenshots of data displays in software rather than actual data files . "
Once they plowed through these problems , they discovered that most of the labs actually had generated data that was sufficient to identify the proteins in the sample , but failed to do so for various reasons .
These included analyzing the mass spec data against different protein databases , using different search methods , and different algorithms for predicting the masses of the proteins in the database used .
Differences in protein terminology produced naming errors and false redundancies .
Different sensitivity cutoffs eliminated sample proteins in some cases , while causing the identification of contaminants in others .
In short , even when a lab was position to get things right , the software pipeline involved in the analysis often failed them .
The authors conclude with what 's essentially a plea for standardization , so that the same analysis would produce the same results .
That would include a normalized set of protein databases , analysis algorithms , and calibration procedures .
Something of the sort would seem essential if the wider scientific community were to have any confidence that a proteomic analysis was actually informative .
Beyond that , the paper serves as a welcome caution .
New approaches tend to arrive with a surplus of fanfare and hype , but developing them into something consistent and reliable is often a long , hard slog .
But , until that 's done , it 's really difficult to know what the approach is actually good for .
