( CNN ) --
After being hidden away for years , a copy of the original " Action Comics No. 1 " comic book , featuring Superman and friends , will make a comeback -- to the tune of about $ 400,000 , a comic expert told CNN Thursday .
A Superman Web site features Action Comics covers , including No. 1 , at left .
Starting Friday , comic book collectors and Superman fans will have the opportunity to bid on a comic classic -- an " unrestored " copy of Action Comics No. 1 , said Stephen Fishler , owner of Comic Connect , an online liaison between comic book buyers and sellers .
The book 's owner is not being identified .
The auction is attracting a lot of interest .
" One bidder wanted to trade his Ferrari for the comic book , " as part of an under - the - table deal , Fishler joked .
But he said the auction will remain public .
" I could n't see myself trading in my Toyota Prius " -- even for a $ 375,000 car .
Why is this comic book so unique ?
" Of the 100 existing copies , 80 percent have been restored , but people want an untouched copy , " Fishler said .
The book is listed in " fine " condition , a six on the 10 - point rating scale .
" It 's the Holy Grail of comic books , " Fishler said .
Co-created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster , the comic book first appeared on newsstands for 10 cents a copy in June 1938 .
Nearly 12 years later , a young boy on the West Coast found himself in a secondhand book store , where he persuaded his dad to loan him 35 cents to buy the comic book .
Until 1966 , the owner forgot about the book , which was hidden in his mother 's basement .
Since then , he 's been holding onto it , hoping to see it increase in value , Fishler said .
He has not been disappointed .
" There has been a lot of interest shown on the book in the collectibles market , " said Fishler , who predicted the comic book will sell for about $ 400,000 .
But , he added , no minimum price has been set for the auction , so " whatever it sells for , it sells for .
" I 've known Action Comics to sell for around $ 750,000 , " comic book sales associate Bill Peterson said .
" I do n't have any intention on making a bid , but I know people who do n't mind dropping several thousand for a classic comic . "
The comic book marked the first appearances of Lois Lane , Giovanni " John " Zatara and , of course , Superman .
The book is in high demand because " there was no such thing as a superhero before Superman .
It spawned everything that came after -- like Batman and Spider - Man , " Fishler said .
Even during the current economic downturn , Fishler expects the book to do well .
Those who can afford to bid , he said , " would ordinarily put money into the stock market .
But that 's a shaky proposition . "
These days , the comic book may even be a better investment than putting money into a CD or a bond , Fishler speculated .
iReport.com : Would you give up your prized possession ?
Because the book was published at the close of the Great Depression , it contains advertisements that may appear quaint and quirky to 21st century readers .
For only $ 1.25 , one could buy a blonde wig , a live chameleon , a whoopee cushion , a Bible " the size of a postage stamp " and hypnosis lessons .
" Some books seem to go in and out of fashion , " reads the auction blurb at comicconnect.com .
But " Action Comics No. 1 will never be one of those books . "

Marijuana smokers in Federal Heights — town motto : Reaching Great Heights — will face lighter penalties when they reach a little higher , The Denver Post reports Monday .
The town ’s City Council last week cut the maximum fine for pot smokers caught with an ounce or less of the herb from $ 1,000 to $ 500 and did away with the possibility of jail time .
Advocates for looser marijuana laws cheered the move as good economic sense in tough times , saying it would save both city prosecutors and pot smokers some hard - earned green .
“ When you consider the massive fine someone could face , it could destroy them , ” the executive director of Sensible Colorado , Brian Vicente , told the Post .
City officials said they were merely bringing their ordinance more into line with state statute , which sets a maximum $ 100 fine without jail time for possessing a lid of pot .
“ I believe we felt it was time to get the punishment more in line with the infraction , ” City Council member Dale Sparks told the Post .
Mayor Pro Tem Richard Steele said the old law was “ too harsh , ” though he disagreed with marijuana advocates who argued pot is less dangerous than alcohol .
After recognizing its Holiday Lighting Contest winners ( first place and $ 100 to Dale Beard ) on Jan. 6 , the City Council voted 4 - 1 to cut in half the maximum penalty for marijuana possession , a petty offense .
The only lawmaker to vote against the new law said she thought the fine should be set even lower , at $ 100 .
“ When people use marijuana recreationally it ’s not a major crime , and people should n’t pay high fines for it , ” Tanya Ishikawa told the Post .
“ Personally , I think $ 500 is too high , especially in these times . ”
Renowned marijuana advocate Mason Tvert , executive director of SAFER , urged the city to follow Ishikawa ’s lead .
“ There ’s no reason individuals in Federal Heights should have to pay $ 500 if they get caught , when their neighbors in Lakewood only have to pay a hundred , ” Tvert said , according to KWGN - TV , which first reported the story .
Penalties for selling the drug or possessing larger amounts remain unchanged .
“ It does n’t mean that you ’re selling or trafficking or anything like that , ” Mayor Joyce Thomas said .
“ That ’s a totally different level . ”
The fines might be dropping in Federal Heights , but marijuana prices remain high in the town of 12,000 , according to a report on WeBeHigh.com , which bills itself as a “ traveler ’s guide to getting high . ”
The site advises the “ [ only ] way to get the good bud in Colorado is to have a connection to a grower , ” while noting , “ There are definitely plenty of them here . ”
Recommended brands in the Federal Heights vicinity include Dynamite , AK - 47 , Bubble Gum and Jack Herer .
Once you find the grower and settle on a brand , be prepared to shell out some serious bucks :
This is one way to lose friends / roommates for good : sneak into the bathroom while they 're in the shower , cover the towel rack with tin foil , and hook up a car battery .
Zzzzap !

We here at Gizmodo HQ are trying to decide if this is real or not .
One the one hand , that spark looks relatively real , and the dude certainly reacts like it 's real , but the battery terminal looks like its hooked up to the foil in a short , which should cause HEAT , not shocks ... Oh wait .
There are two separate pieces of foil going on there !
But anyhow , what kind of person would actually do this ?
Good god .

The US should apologise for " crimes " it has committed against Iran if it wants a better relationship with Tehran , the Iranian president said today , after recent overtures to the Muslim world from the new administration in Washington .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's uncompromising tone followed a conciliatory message from Barack Obama , the US president , earlier this week when he told the Islamic world : " We are not your enemies . "
In his inauguration last week , Obama offered to extend a hand of peace if Iran " unclenched its fist " .
At a rally in western Iran today , broadcast live on national television , Ahmadinejad said Iran would welcome a change in US policy provided it involved a withdrawal of American troops from abroad and an apology to Iran .
" Those who say they want to make change , this is the change they should make : they should apologise to the Iranian nation and try to make up for their dark background and the crimes they have committed against the Iranian nation , " he said .
The Iranian leader listed a range of " crimes " , such as trying to block what Tehran says is a peaceful nuclear power programme , hindering Iran 's development since the 1979 revolution and other actions by US administrations dating back more than 60 years .
Ahmadinejad had harsh words for George Bush , who he said " has gone into the trash can of history with a very black and shameful file full of treachery and killings .
He left and , God willing , he will go to hell . "
In a break with his predecessor , Obama has dangled the prospect of direct talks with Tehran without preconditions .
Susan Rice , the new US ambassador to the United Nations , has pledged " vigorous " and " direct " nuclear diplomacy with Iran but warned that pressure would increase if it refused to halt uranium enrichment .
Analysts believe Obama 's election offers " a once - in - a - generation opportunity " for a new start in relations between Tehran and Washington , which were severed after students seized the US embassy in Tehran and took more than 90 hostages following the 1979 revolution .
" They will never get a new US president who is as balanced as Obama 's public statements are , who talks about wanting to engage in a respectful way with Iran and who seems less encumbered by the baggage of the past , " a western diplomat told the Associated Press .
" It is in Iran 's clear interest to engage . "
He warned of the risk that hardliners clinging to a " we 're - winning - you 're - losing rhetoric " may prevail .
An Iranian opposition politician , Ebrahim Yazdi , said he did not expect movement on the issue of US relations before June , when Ahmadinejad is expected to seek re-election .
Yazdi said better ties were in Iran 's strategic and economic interest , adding : " The political atmosphere in Iran is now ripe , is suitable for direct negotiation with the United States . "
The five permanent members of the UN security council – Britain , China , France , Russia and the US – along with Germany have offered Tehran economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment programme , which the west sees as a cover to acquire a nuclear weapons capability .
Tehran is pressing on with the programme , which it says is geared toward electricity generation .
Alex Crookes knew he was in for a divorce with a difference the minute he walked into a lawyer 's office with his ex-wife , Lynne Maclennan .
The couple instinctively sat at opposite sides of the table , until one of their lawyers , trained in the relatively new concept of collaborative family law , set a more comfortable tone for the talks .
" The first thing the lawyer said was , ` Sit next to each other , ' " says Crookes , 37 .
So the Toronto couple , who 've been together almost 15 years , share a three - storey house and two young children , plotted out their new future – and separate lives – over the course of two " very difficult " meetings .
" It was very nonconfrontational , " says Crookes , who is in the midst of moving into a new home this week , a couple of blocks from his 8 - year - old son and 5 - year - old daughter .
" The lawyers were there to make sure that nobody was screaming or throwing coffee cups at each other , but that seemed to be their primary role , " he says .
" It was up to us to talk about what we were scared of , what we were worried about , what we wanted to achieve . "
Maclennan and Crookes once questioned whether the cost , about $ 6,000 each , was worth it .
" We were laughing because we went to both meetings together , we drove in the same car , we had lunch together afterward .
We said , ` Do you think we really needed the lawyers ? ' " says Maclennan , 40 .
" But really we did because ( the collaborative process ) forced us to move things along rather than languishing .
There were some things that gave me a different perspective . "
Collaborative law was first introduced in Minneapolis in 1990s and made its way to Canada a decade later as a much - needed alternative to ugly court battles that could cost a fortune and leave the couple , and their kids , scarred for life .
Since then Toronto has become a " hotbed " for collaborative settlements , divorce experts say , and it 's growing in popularity right across Canada .
In 2000 , just 75 Canadian lawyers were trained in collaborative practice .
Today they number more than 2,800 .
Collaborative practice puts the separated couple in the driver 's seat , or , more appropriately , seats .
While their lawyers are always in the room to offer advice or give guidance , the couple sort out for themselves how they want their life to look post - divorce , where the kids will live and how much of the time , what the primary breadwinner will pay in support .
Nearby are also financial and family counselling experts who can help clear away unexpected hurdles and get the two sides back on track if things start going off the rails , without the " bottomless pit " of $ 300 to $ 600 per hour lawyer fees needed to mount a court challenge .
Thanks to the growth in collaborative practice , as well as mediation and then arbitration as last resorts if an agreement can't be reached , just 2 to 3 per cent of all divorces now end up in court , divorce experts say .
" I think as divorce rates increased and lawyers became better educated in family law , they learned about the pain and the suffering , and that slogging it out in a courtroom is a very hard way to make a living , " says Philip Epstein , who is trained as a collaborative lawyer but prefers mediation .
" To be in a profession where it 's all about winning and losing is just too painful for all concerned . "
Family law lawyer Sheila Kirsh , one of the founding members of Collaborative Practice Toronto , an umbrella group for some 81 lawyers , 17 family counsellors and 15 financial experts , did litigation for 20 years until one final court battle made her think differently .
" At the end of the day , I won , but I was n't feeling very satisfied with what had happened .
I thought there had to be a better way than going through three years of litigation , a way to have families remain intact – yes , they 're going to have separate households – with both still willing to go to their children 's weddings . "
Divorce lawyers have had to become especially " creative " since last fall because of tanking stock prices , pension plans and house values that made it almost impossible for experts to come up with net worth calculations and determine support and the split of assets .
The ongoing uncertainty has forced many lawyers to look at more open - ended agreements that can be revisited in a few months , or years , when the economy rebounds .
Collaborative law lends itself especially well to that , says family law lawyer Judith Huddart .
Epstein spent decades battling it out in court , but now settles 98 per cent of his cases through mediation .
Few go the next step , arbitration , in which an independent person looks at both sides of the case and makes a binding judgment .
Epstein is also trained in collaborative law , but believes it works best for couples who " are not overwrought or not overly emotional about their divorce and can treat each other as equals .

" I believe that the system works better if the lawyer has reasonable control over the process ( mediation . )
Collaborative law believes the client should be in control .
One of the advantages of a lawyer is that I 'm objective about the outcome . "
Everyone agrees the key is staying out of court .
" What 's ruinous for people is if they settle too late .
Even if they settle in the middle of a trial , they 've spent all the money , " says Epstein .
Just last week , he helped settle " one of the most difficult ( divorces ) I 've ever seen . "
Lawyers had already amassed " a room full " of documents , anticipating a court case .
He warned the couple repeatedly that litigation would take about 10 days and cost them at least $ 100,000 each .
And he stressed the outcome could be highly unpredictable , depending on how the judge applied divorce case law and " spousal support guidelines " that give ranges for how much support should be paid , depending on income and length of the marriage .
In mediation , he stressed , you get to choose your own " judge . "
In court , one is assigned to you .
At the end of that reality check , Epstein gave the couple a day to try reaching a settlement through mediation .
They had a deal by 7 o'clock that night , at a cost of about $ 7,500 each .
" It 's a bottomless pit if you start preparing for a trial , " says Epstein , which is why he recently wrote a paper for judges , urging them to talk money at every pre-trial conference – " they 're shy about that " – so that couples are well aware how much they are paying their lawyer per hour , how long the case might take and the risk of having to pay court costs if they lose .
" The right time ( to settle ) is when the parties are emotionally ready to actually want to do business .
The problem with matrimonial law is that it 's sometimes about vengeance or hurt or the inability to let go .
Those are poor candidates for early mediation ( or collaboration . ) "
Maclennan cautions that collaboration is n't a cakewalk – and since neither had had an affair or held on to some seething hatred , their separation was less complicated than many .
But still , she and Crookes " had to put personal differences and desires aside to a large extent " and work hard toward their common goal of " putting the kids ' well - being first . "
" In order to do this we had to respect each other and learn to communicate better .
It has been hard but , in the end , it 's definitely worth it . "

A motorist who offered a crash victim shelter in his car watched in horror as firemen sliced it open to get him out .
Sean Carter , 42 , was driving home when he saw a Citroen Saxo spin out of control , roll over and hit a hedge .
He dialled 999 and told the driver to sit in his 10 - month old Ford Focus .
But when medics arrived they decided the victim should only be moved out horizontally on a spinal board via the car roof .
Sean from Nottingham said : " Sometimes a good deed is n't worth it . "
During his first week as commander in chief , President Barack Obama ordered the closure of Guantanamo Bay and terminated the CIA 's special authority to interrogate terrorists .
While these actions will certainly please his base -- gone are the cries of an " imperial presidency " -- they will also seriously handicap our intelligence agencies from preventing future terrorist attacks .
In issuing these executive orders , Mr. Obama is returning America to the failed law enforcement approach to fighting terrorism that prevailed before Sept. 11 , 2001 .
He 's also drying up the most valuable sources of intelligence on al Qaeda , which , according to CIA Director Michael Hayden , has come largely out of the tough interrogation of high - level operatives during the early years of the war .
The question Mr. Obama should have asked right after the inaugural parade was :
What will happen after we capture the next Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or Abu Zubaydah ?
Instead , he took action without a meeting of his full national security staff , and without a legal review of all the policy options available to meet the threats facing our country .
What such a review would have made clear is that the civilian law - enforcement system cannot prevent terrorist attacks .
What is needed are the tools to gain vital intelligence , which is why , under President George W. Bush , the CIA could hold and interrogate high - value al Qaeda leaders .
On the advice of his intelligence advisers , the president could have authorized coercive interrogation methods like those used by Israel and Great Britain in their antiterrorism campaigns .
( He could even authorize waterboarding , which he did three times in the years after 9/11 . )
Mr. Obama has also ordered that all military commission trials be stayed and that the case of Ali Saleh al - Marri , the only al Qaeda operative now held on U.S. soil , be reviewed .
This seems a prelude to closing the military commissions down entirely and transferring the detainees ' cases to U.S. civilian courts for prosecution under ordinary criminal law .
Military commission trials have been used in most American wars , and their rules and procedures are designed around the need to protect intelligence sources and methods from revelation in open court .
A study looking at the entire human genome has identified new genes that appear to be involved in making some children more susceptible to Kawasaki disease ( KD ) , a serious illness that often leads to coronary artery disease , according to a new international study published in PLoS Genetics .
This is the first genetic study of an infectious disease to look at the whole of the genome , rather than just selected genes .
Researchers from UC San Diego School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics joined an international research team , including colleagues from The University of Western Australia , the Genome Institute of Singapore , Emma Children 's Hospital , The Netherlands , and Imperial College London , UK .
The group studied naturally occurring genetic variation in almost 900 cases of Kawasaki disease from these countries .
UC San Diego coordinated the U.S. genetics effort , collecting DNA samples from around the country .
" KD tends to run in families , suggesting that there are genetic components to disease risk , " said Jane C. Burns , M.D. , professor and Chief , Division of Allergy , Immunology , and Rheumatology , UC San Diego Department of Pediatrics .
" We have been trying to understand the step by step development of this disease ( pathogenesis ) and the chain of events leading to it , using a biological approach but with limited success .
This robust , systematic genome wide study is simply letting the genetics tell us what are the key genes in KD pathogenesis .
Without this research these newly discovered genes of interest might have continued to remain hidden . "
Kawasaki disease is an unusual and serious illness of young children that causes high fever , rash , red eyes and lips , swollen glands , and swollen hands and feet with peeling skin .
The disease also causes damage of the coronary arteries in a quarter of untreated children and may increase the risk of atherosclerosis in early adulthood .
The cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown , but it seems to be due to an infection in susceptible children .
There is no diagnostic test for Kawasaki disease , and current treatment fails to prevent coronary damage in at least one in 10 - 20 children and death in one in 1,000 children .
This study found that genes involved in cardiovascular function and inflammation may be particularly important and some seem to function together .
The authors consider that these findings will lead to new diagnostics and better treatment and may be informative about adult cardiovascular disease as well .
The findings do not yet prove that the new genes are functionally involved .
Other genetic variants may be important , especially in different ethnic groups .
The authors are planning detailed studies of the function of these genes and larger collaborative studies including East Asian populations , who are at particular risk of Kawasaki disease , with 1 in 150 Japanese children affected .
" So now it is time to come back to the biology and study the genes and the pathways and their role in KD pathogenesis , " explained associate project scientist Chisato Shimizu , M.D. , Kawasaki Disease Research Center , UC San Diego School of Medicine .
" Most importantly , we will be able to use these data to help us predict which children with Kawasaki disease are at most risk for heart disease from their KD . "
" Our laboratory is the focal point where the combination of academic research and clinical investigation lead to better treatment and patient outcome , " explained Kawasaki Disease Research Center Assistant Director , Adriana Tremoulet , M.D. , assistant adjunct professor , UC San Diego Department of Pediatrics and Rady Children 's Hospital .
" UC San Diego represents the entire U.S. genetics consortium .
Through a grant from the NIH we have been able to support DNA collection in Los Angeles , Hawaii , Chicago , and Boston , as well as Japan and Finland .
We coordinate the entire U.S. KD genetics effort and are the conduit for U.S. DNA to join the international effort based in Singapore . "
Burns says the next steps include " drilling down " on candidate genes and pathways that were discovered in the genome - wide analysis .
This detailed analysis will identify the exact genetic differences that influence disease susceptibility and outcome .
" We can already see a way in which this suggests a new treatment for KD that may be much less expensive than the current treatment with IVIG ( intravenous immunoglobulin ) , " said Burns .

In his March16 , 2010 YouTube interview Stephen Harper responded to the assertion that " the majority of Canadians believe cannabis should be legalized " by saying :
" Well , it ’s a good question .
I ’m not sure I ’ve seen this particular poll .
There are different polls on this subject that show different things . ”
Mr. Harper , if you 've managed to find this web page , congratulations ... and welcome to the internets .
Mexico City — Mexico can be intolerant of homosexuality ; it can also be quite liberal .
Gay - bashing incidents are not uncommon in the countryside , where many Mexicans consider homosexuality a sin .
In Mexico City , meanwhile , same - sex domestic partnerships are legally recognized  and often celebrated lavishly in government offices as if they were marriages .
But nowhere are attitudes toward sex and gender quite as elastic as in the far reaches of the southern state of Oaxaca .
There , in the indigenous communities around the town of Juchitán , the world is not divided simply into gay and straight .
The local Zapotec people have made room for a third category , which they call “ muxes ” ( pronounced MOO - shays )  men who consider themselves women and live in a socially sanctioned netherworld between the two genders .
“ Muxe ” is a Zapotec word derived from the Spanish “ mujer , ” or woman ; it is reserved for males who , from boyhood , have felt themselves drawn to living as a woman , anticipating roles set out for them by the community .
Manufacturing serendipity is a tricky business , as the makers of any number of whimsical , failed television series can tell you .
Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie managed it better than most in the first 12 - episode season of “ Flight of the Conchords ” on HBO last year .
Season 2 begins on Sunday ( the first episode is already available at hbo.com ) , and the off - kilter charm is still there , though some strain is beginning to show .
This fish - out - of - water sitcom about a pair of guileless New Zealand musicians bumbling through life in New York has a formula and sticks to it : stretches of surrealist , deadpan comedy , so minimal as to be barely there , alternate with comparatively elaborate , Michel Gondry - style fantastical musical numbers .
The “ Seinfeld ” - like plots are spun from air : Bret buys a mug for $ 2.79 and plunges the duo into such dire economic straits that Jemaine takes up prostitution , complete with a “ Midnight Cowboy ” hotel room parody .
( “ I have a few rules .
One , no laughing , especially during , O.K. ?
Put ’s me off . ” )
During a performance in a library , Bret ad - libs insults to some prominent rappers , then forms his own gang  which includes the middle - aged Asian proprietors of the Internet cafe downstairs  in case Snoop Dogg or Missy Elliott comes looking for him .
Kate Louise Lawler ( born May 7 , 1980 in Beckenham , London ) was the first female winner of Big Brother UK , winning the 2002 third British season of Big Brother .
Since leaving Big Brother , she has worked as a television presenter and personality , a model and as a disc jockey .

Toronto has taken the lead in bringing the Atheist Bus Campaign to Canada .
The Straight initially asked whether the campaign , started in London , U.K. , by comedy writer Ariane Sherine recently , would come to Vancouver .
The January 7 blog posting noted that the event had been hatched in Sherine ’s brain as she noticed the presence of Christian - based advertising on London ’s buses .
So , the campaign kicked off in the new year there on the sides of around 800 buses , each bearing the slogan , “ There ’s probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . ”
One week after the Straight story , Chris from the Toronto faction of the ABC wrote in a comment to the story encouraging traffic to the Web site Atheistbus.ca and the group ’s Facebook .
The entries are all January 12 and later , so maybe the Straight alerted T.O. ’s nascent atheist community .

1984 : Poison gas leaks from a Union Carbide pesticide factory in Bhopal , India .
It spreads throughout the city , killing thousands of people outright and thousands more subsequently in a disaster often described as the worst industrial accident in history .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Union Carbide chose Bhopal , a city of 900,000 people in the state of Madhya Pradesh , because of its central location and its proximity to a lake and to the country ’s vast rail system .
The plant opened in 1969 and produced the pesticide carbaryl , which was marketed as Sevin .
Ten years later the plant began manufacturing methyl isocyanate , or MIC , a cheaper but more toxic substance used in the making of pesticides .
It was MIC gas that was released when water leaked into one of the storage tanks late on the night of Dec. 2 , setting off the disaster .
Gas began escaping from Tank 610 around 10:30 p.m. although the main warning siren did n’t go off for another two hours .
The first effects were felt almost immediately in the vicinity of the plant .
As the gas cloud spread into Bhopal proper , residents were awakened to a blinding , vomiting , lung - searing hell .
Panic ensued and hundreds of people died in the chaotic stampede that followed .
An exact death toll has never been established .
Union Carbide , not surprisingly , set the toll on the low end at 3,800 , while municipal workers claimed to have cleared at least 15,000 bodies in the immediate aftermath of the accident .
Thousands have died since and an estimated 50,000 people became invalids or developed chronic respiratory conditions as a result of being poisoned .
Regardless of the numbers , all evidence pointed to Union Carbide and its Indian subsidiary , as well as the Indian government , its partner in the factory , being responsible , mainly through negligence , for what occurred .
Despite the extreme volatility and toxicity of the chemicals in use at the factory , safeguards known to be substandard were ignored rather than fixed .
In the subsequent investigations and legal proceedings , it was determined , among other things , that :
Staffing at the plant had been cut to save money .
Workers who complained about codified safety violations were reprimanded , and occasionally fired .
</
No plan existed for coping with a disaster of this magnitude .
Tank alarms that would have alerted personnel to the leak had n’t functioned for at least four years .
Other backup systems were either not functioning or nonexistent .
The plant was equipped with a single back - up system , unlike the four - stage system typically found in American plants .
Tank 610 held 42 tons of MIC , well above the prescribed capacity .
( It is believed that 27 tons escaped in the leak . )
Water sprays designed to dilute escaping gas were poorly installed and proved ineffective .
Damage known to exist , such as to piping and valves , had not been repaired or replaced because the cost was considered too high .
Warnings from U.S. and Indian experts about other shortcomings at the plant were similarly ignored .
The aftermath of the disaster was almost as chaotic .
Union Carbide was initially responsive , rushing aid and money to Bhopal .
Nevertheless , faced with a $ 3 billion lawsuit , the company dug in , eventually agreeing to a $ 470 million settlement , a mere 15 percent of the original claim .
In any case , very little money ever reached the victims of the disaster .
Warren Anderson , Union Carbide ’s CEO , went before Congress in December 1984 , pledging his company ’s renewed commitment to safety , a promise that rang hollow in India ( and probably to Congress as well ) .
Anderson was subsequently charged with manslaughter by Indian prosecutors but managed to evade an international arrest warrant and disappeared .
Investigators from Greenpeace , which has kept up an active interest in the case , found Anderson in 2002 , alive and well and living comfortably in the Hamptons .
The United States has shown no inclination to hand him over to Indian justice , and most of the serious charges against him have been dropped .
Union Carbide , meanwhile , was acquired by the Dow Corporation in 2001 , which refused to assume any additional liability for Bhopal , arguing that the debt had already been paid through various court settlements .
It did go on to settle another outstanding claim against Union Carbide , this one for $ 2.2 billion made by asbestos workers in Texas .
A few outstanding legal claims from Bhopal remain to be settled , both in India and the United States , but most of the court wrangling is over .
The victims of the disaster , those who live on , continue dealing with various health problems — including chronic respiratory problems , vision problems and an increased incidence of cancer and birth defects — and an environment that remains contaminated to this day .

Gaza residents : IDF troops posing as Hamas men
By Amira Hass , Haaretz Correspondent on : 11.01.2009
The testimonies of Gaza Strip residents are revealing new details about the Israel Defense Forces ’ mode of operation there .
In the past two days , Beit Lahia residents forced from their homes said soldiers were posing as members of Hamas ’ armed wing while advancing on the ground .
The daily pauses in bombing allow Gazans to meet with the displaced – most of whom are housed in an UNRWA school – and hear their stories .
Gaza resident S. told Haaretz he heard several people say they saw armed men wearing the uniforms and symbols of the Iz al - Din al - Qassam Brigades , who “ called out to each other in Arabic , as if they had caught a collaborator , and then , with the element of surprise , went into the houses . ”
A Gaza radio station warned that troops posing as locals were driving a vehicle normally used by paramedics .
Residents said the radio broadcaster listed the vehicle ’s license plate number and color .
Haaretz has also learned that one of the army ’s methods for evacuating a home is to fire a missile toward its upper level .
That is how B. ’s house in Sajaiyeh was destroyed .
It was bombed just a few minutes after a missile struck and 40 shell - shocked family members walked out of the house .
The IDF has also forced at least 40,000 people to leave their homes in agricultural and border areas .
In Rafah , most of the 20,000 people removed from their homes were lodging with relatives and not in UNRWA facilities .

The APEX Telescope in Chile has produced a spectacular , high - resolution image of jets and lobes emanating from the supermassive black hole at the center of Centaurus A , our nearest giant galaxy .
The galaxy is located 13 million light years from Earth and is actually the combination of an elliptical galaxy merging with a spiral galaxy .
It has a very active star forming region and is a strong source of radio radiation emitted in the form of jets .
The image is the first taken of the black hole at submillimeter wavelengths , revealing the radio jets of subatomic particles being ejected at about half the speed of light .
The lobes north and south of the central dust disc can also be seen .
The glow to the lower right of the galaxy is the shockwave created by the lobe colliding with the surrounding gas .
The image is a composite made up of images taken with different instruments at different wavelengths .
The Chandra X-ray Observatory imaged X -ray wavelengths , and the MPG / ESO Telescope brought out the background stars and dust disc .

There are some decent arguments out there that argue in favor of a state , welfare rights , war , democracy , drug laws , and so on .
They are all flawed , since libertarianism is right , but there are coherent , honest arguments that we libertarians have to grapple with .
But it is striking that there are no decent arguments for IP -- as Manuel Lora remarked to me , " You know , I have n't seen a good pro IP article ever . "
This is true .
One sees the same incoherent or insincere claims made over and over , such as :
It 's in the constitution ( argument from authority ; legal positivism )
Intellectual property is called property !
( argument by definition ? )
No movies would be made and kids would die without medicine ( artworks and medicine have been produced for ages without IP law ; and where 's the evidence ? )
If you " create " something you own it ( despite all the exceptions , and despite the fact that creation is neither necessary nor sufficient for ownership ; despite the fact that you either limit these rights in scope or time arbitrarily , or you extent them to infinity , choking off rights in real things and forcing life and commerce to a screeching halt )
It generates net wealth - - more value than its cost ( no evidence , ever , for this contention -- just assumptions ; not to mention the problem of utilitarian summing of values ) IP infringement is " theft " ( even though the owner still has his property and ideas , and even though IP infringement is just learning and emulating )
People " could " create variants of IP via private contracts ... therefore artifical patent granting bureaucracies legislated by a criminal state are ... justified ? )
There are other arguments , I suppose , but they are so incoherent as to defy description .
They often involve crankish initial caps , like Property and Rights , the Internet equivalent of crayons .
I have truly never seen a coherent , good argument for IP .
The advocates are either utilitarian , with all the problems that accompany that ( not to mention they never have any evidence for their claims ) ; or the advocate a more " principled " , rights - based type of IP that , if taken seriously , would completely undermine all real property rights and make life on earth impossible , so they retreat from this and impose arbitrary , senseless limits on it .
What a kluge .
In a recent discussion , What 's Wrong With Theft ? , one of the IP advocates , when pushed into a corner , ended up arguing that rights to own property include the right to control all " access to " and " interactions with " one 's property -- and that " interactions " include observing or knowing about or learning facts about the things owned by someone , and that when you use this knowledge you are " interacting with " the property , and thus " stealing " it ( even though the owner still has it ) .
So here we have it : IP means " interaction rights . "
Wow .
This is how kooky all IP arguments ultimately are .
All the basics — from maps and wayfinding , to how to lock your bike , to what to do if you ’re in a crash .

Obama administration scolds Citigroup
The Obama administration knows how to use the bully pulpit .
A Treasury Department official on Monday called Citigroup , which has received $ 45 billion in bailout capital from the government , to protest plans to accept delivery on a luxurious $ 50 million corporate jet made in France .
Advertisement
The New York Post reported on the plan under the headline , “ JUST PLANE DESPICABLE . ”
President Obama has said he will demand more accountability from recipients of bailout funds , and Citigroup now is finding out what that means .
The Treasury official called the bank to complain and told the executive to find a solution .
Among the possibilities would be selling or leasing the fancy flier , since there are penalties associated with killing the contract outright .
In any case , the administration does not want the plane put in service under the Citigroup banner .
The call was made by an official other than Timothy Geithner , shortly before he was sworn in by the president on Monday night after winning confirmation from the Senate .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , asked about the plane at his televised briefing , said the president believes that that for banks receiving U.S. capital “ so that they can lend money , ” private jets are n’t “ the best use of money at this point . ”
“ Instead , that money should be used to lend to consumers to get the economy moving again , to free up capital and credit , and help small businesses create jobs , ” Gibbs said .
“ He said that as it relates to the auto industry , and he believes that as it relates to banks as well . ”
The plane – a Dassault Falcon 7X — quickly became a new poster child for excess by companies being kept afloat by taxpayers .
The N.Y .
Post story says : “ The French - made luxury jet seats up to 12 in a plush interior with leather seats , sofas and a customizable entertainment center , according to Dassault 's sales literature .
It can cruise 5,950 miles before refueling and has a top speed of 559 mph .
There are just nine of these top - of - the - line models in the United States , with Dassault 's European factory churning out three to four 7Xs a month . ”
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) called the purchase an “ absurdity . ”
“ To permit Citigroup to purchase a plush plane – foreign - built no less – while domestic auto companies are being required to sell off their jets is a ridiculous double standard , ” Levin said in a statement .
“ I have urged Tim Geithner … to do what he can to stop this absurdity from occurring , and I am assured he will look into the matter promptly . ”
MUMBAI : The tricolour landed on the Moon at 8.31 pm on Friday , opening a new chapter in the history of India���s space exploration .
( Watch )
Other entities which have reached the Moon are the US , former Soviet Union , Japan ( albeit via a malfunction that sent its orbiter crashing onto the lunar surface ) and the European Space Agency ( 17 nations ) .
India becomes the fifth member of this club .
The tricolour was painted on all sides of the 29 kg Moon Impact Probe ( MIP ) which was attached to the top portion of the main lunar orbiter , Chandrayaan .
The MIP is the brainchild of former President A P J Abdul Kalam who witnessed its separation from the main orbiting craft and its crashlanding 32 km from the Shackleton crater on the moon���s south pole from the mission control room at ISRO ���s telemetry , tracking and command network ( ISTRAC ) in Bangalore .
ISRO officials told TOI that the countdown for the MIP ���s much - awaited flight to the surface of the Moon began at 7.47 pm .
It went off smoothly and at 8.01 pm the command was issued for it to separate from the orbiting spacecraft .
The MIP began its flight towards the Moon���s south pole and after a 25 - minute flight , crashlanded .
During its flight , its video camera took pictures of the Moon , the spectrometer began its analysis and the altitude meter did what is known as a ranging .
While approaching the Moon , it slowed down slightly , then spun .
While spinning , its three instruments went into action .
When it was 5 km above the Moon���s surface , the altimeter did the ���ranging of the Moon��� .
���� �
�All this while the atmosphere was pretty tense in the mission control room , ������ said a scientist .
Kalam���s rationale for including the MIP was that since Chandrayaan was orbiting the Moon at an altitude of 100 km above the lunar surface , a landing would make India���s presence felt on the Moon���s surface .
He believed that if this was done , India could always stake a claim to a portion of the Moon .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The cost of the bank bailout is likely to be much higher than $ 700 billion .
While the Obama administration has n't asked Congress for more money yet , some experts warn that government spending on support for struggling financial services companies will ultimately reach into the trillions of dollars .
The first half of the controversial $ 700 billion program to help banks has already been spent -- mostly on buying up preferred shares of troubled banks .
Part of the remaining $ 350 billion may be used to purchase troubled assets from bank balance sheets and place them in what Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chief Sheila Bair has dubbed an " aggregator bank . "
And while taxpayers will surely recover some of that sum eventually , more money is likely to be needed in order for the bank rescue to work .
" The amount of working capital you 'd expect the government to take into this would be around $ 3 trillion to $ 4 trillion , " said Simon Johnson , a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and author of its Baseline Scenario financial crisis blog .
Johnson , who until last year was the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , said that banks will need more rounds of capital from the government because their cushion against losses is too thin .
He also said that there is a need to get rid of some of the toxic assets weighing on financial institutions before they can recover .
With that in mind , he thinks that the net cost to U.S. taxpayers for a broadened bailout would be about $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion , or between 5 % and 10 % of U.S. gross domestic product .
He said this figure is " in line with the experience " of other nations that have tried massive banking system restructuring .
Johnson is n't the first to estimate that the final cost of a bank bailout will be well north of $ 1 trillion .
FBR Capital analyst Paul Miller said in November that just the top eight U.S. financial institutions alone needed at least $ 1 trillion in new common equity .
Plunging stocks increase the sense of urgency
But calls for a comprehensive response from the government have increased in recent weeks following the free fall of bank stocks .
The KBW Bank index has dropped 35 % in January after a 50 % plunge in 2008 , as investors worry that the government may be forced to nationalize some banks -- and wipe out shareholders in the process .
Shares of Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) have been particularly hard hit .
" The big banks are a hope trade right now , " Johnson said .
Though the Obama administration has n't said it will need more money beyond the second $ 350 billion installment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , officials have not ruled out the possibility of asking Congress for further funds .
Vice President Joe Biden said on CBS ' " Face the Nation " Sunday that the first task for the likely new Treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , will be to assess whether the remaining $ 350 billion in funds available under TARP will be enough to stop the bleeding .
Geithner said last week that he did n't yet see the need for more money , but stressed that the Treasury may have to " act flexibly " if the problems in the economy and the financial sector deepen .
While officials will have to spend huge sums upfront to show the market that they wo n't let important institutions fail , Johnson said taxpayers wo n't have to end up on the hook for the entire amount of money that 's being injected into banks .
Johnson said the government could get warrants in banks receiving assistance that would convert to common shares once the government sells them .
He also said the government could hire private equity managers to oversee the assets the government takes on -- and sell them when the time is right .
These arrangements , he said , should allow the Treasury to extract some gains for taxpayers when the economic free fall ends and the banking system starts to recover .
Some observers believe asset values are so depressed right now that as long as the government has a well designed plan that restores investor confidence , taxpayers should profit from the financial bailout
" I think we have seen prices fall to a point where the government could very easily make money , though I 'd be very happy if we end up breaking even , " says Gary Hager , president of Integrated Wealth Management in Edison , N.J .
What could go wrong
If the history of previous banking system rescues is any guide though , there 's also a good chance that removing toxic assets from bank balance sheets could leave taxpayers with a significant tab .
When Congress created the Resolution Trust Corp. in 1989 to clean up the mess left by the collapse of the savings and loan industry , legislators gave the RTC $ 50 billion to close or resolve troubled institutions .
But the RTC wound up needing three additional infusions of taxpayer funds over six years , as regulators confronted an industry whose health was much worse than feared .
In the end , taxpayers took a $ 124 billion loss on the RTC 's operations , according to a 2000 study published by FDIC researchers Timothy Curry and Lynn Shibut .
The RTC resolved 747 institutions , with total assets of $ 394 billion , according to the study .
That means taxpayers lost 31 cents on each dollar of assets handled by the RTC -- an institution that , because it was simply disposing of the property of failed institutions , did n't have to pay for assets it later sold .
In contrast , the widely discussed aggregator bank would be paying institutions that participate for their assets .
Details of how the aggregator bank would decide how much to pay for toxic assets have yet to be determined .
But whatever method the aggregator bank uses , it could mean significantly higher startup costs than the RTC had .
So expect to see the Obama administration coming back to Congress for more money ... soon .

Obviously by now you can interpolate my views on detox : meaningless , symbolic , gimmicky shortlived health gestures with a built - in expiry date , when we could be reading about the NHS ’s surprisingly useful website to help you stop smoking ( do it now : smokefree.nhs.uk / ) , or lifestyle pieces on the joys of buying a bike , and making a genuine move to integrate exercise into your daily life for the long term .
I ’m not trying to bore you .
But after a few months of concentrating on dodgy reporting in the media , I had genuinely forgotten how far out a proper fruitcake can get .
Fate dealt me Nas Amir Ahmadi , managing director ( which earns her the impressive soubriquet “ MD ” ) of a company called Detoxinabox .
I discussed detox with her on Radio 4 .
My interest in Nas ’s work was first piqued when she began to deny actual verbatim quotes from her own website .
What is the evidence that your detox regime will eradicate cadmium from my body , I asked ?
You must have the wrong website , doctor .
Never heard of the idea , she said .
But there it was , bright as day : “ One of the most complex detoxification functions is against heavy metals such as lead , mercury , cadminum [ sic ] , nickel , arsenic , and aluminum [ which is n’t a heavy metal ] . ”
And so on .
Now , of all the strategies for wiggling out of a foolish statement , simply denying you ever made it strikes me as the least intellectually sophisticated , possibly the most irritating , and certainly the most shortsighted .
I ’m sure she ’s not the first .
Nas says she made a mistake .
No problem .
In returning to the website to check , I had a look around .
There were lots of exciting claims .
Here are five .
“ Pumpkin seeds are a natural depression cure ! ” “ Lemon helps maintain healthy teeth and bones ” “ Olives help delay the effects of ageing . ” “ ½ teaspoon of cinnamon per day helps lower cholesterol ! ” , and “ Tuna helps lower blood pressure ” .
I asked Nas if they had any evidence to back up these claims .
No , she agreed .
They do not have any “ scientific evidence ” .
Then she seemed to change her mind , and offered some .
The evidence she offered included : a study involving 7 people ; a random webpage that says “ Lemons build bones and teeth and nourish the brain and nerve cells ” ; a typically tenuous nutritionist chain of reasoning involving the almost - dead antioxidant hypothesis ; weak observational correlations ; and so on .
But some of the site , like a page titled “ Which Came First – Depression or Diabetes ? “ , stuck out a mile .
It was quite sciencey , quite plausible , and quite interesting , a write up of a proper research paper .
Was this really written by Detoxinabox ?
No .
In fact , they simply copied the entire text , verbatim , hundreds of words , from a blog post by a proper pharmacist named Jennifer Gibson , and passed it off as their own , removing only her name , and swapping in their own images .
The original image in Jennifer Gibson ’s blog post would have given away the actual source .
Ownership of ideas is a grey area , but this seems to be a rather clear example of plagiarism , over 500 words from start to finish .
The person running the Brainblogger website , where the piece was published , has described detoxinabox as “ thieves ” .
Detoxinabox have not responded to me on this issue , but they have removed the page from their site .
And interestingly , Nas ’s difficulty in recalling the claims about cadminum from her own website might also be explained by their original source .
The entire sentence “ One of the most complex detoxification functions is against heavy metals such as lead , mercury , cadminum , nickel , arsenic , and aluminum . ” appears , verbatim , on another company ’s website , detox - guide.com , complete with that tell - tale mis-spelling of cadmium .
There ’s nothing unique about Detoxinabox .
What ’s amazing is the ratio between their competence and their media penetrance which is unreplicated , I would say , in any field outside science .
Let ’s just re-examine the crimes .
You deny what is plainly true .
You make claims without evidence .
You admit that , but then you change your mind .
Your evidence is magnificently poor .
You seem to plagiarise whole articles , verbatim , from real everyday people who ’ve actually bothered to spend some time familiarising themselves with science , and write about it online because they ’re passionate about it .
And finally , crucially , your industry ’s nonsense ideas get more – and more favourable – coverage in mainstream media than any piece of actual science , or any meaningful public health intervention .
Nas has explained to me that she is mystified why so many people from the world of science and medicine seem to be annoyed with her .
Yup .
It ’s a mystery .

Introduction
3 years ago , ATI and NVIDIA graphics card line - up was not as complex as it is today .
Many of their graphics cards were actually using the same GPU , so enthusiasts could mod their lower - end cards , using software or hardware methods , into higher - end graphcs cards .
For example , the very popular Radeon 9800 SE to Radeon 9800 Pro mod , the GeForce 6200 to GeForce 6600 GT mod and the GeForce 6800 LE to GeForce 6800 GT mod .
All these mods increased the performance and value of the graphics card , making graphics card modding highly popular .
When ATI and NVIDIA began using many different GPUs for different product lines , graphics card modding fell out of favour because enthusiasts could only overclock their graphics cards to maximize their potential .
However , a method for soft - modding an NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GSO into an NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB has been found .
This mod instantly gives you a GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB card at half the cost !
Determining The Modding Possibility
GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB GeForce 9600 GSO GPU G92-400 G92- 150 Fabrication Process 65 nm 65 nm Transistor Count 754 Million 754 Million DirectX Support DirectX 10 DirectX 10 Stream Processors 128 96 ROP 16 12 Core Clock 650 MHz 550 MHz Shader Clock 1625 MHz 1375 MHz Memory Clock 1944 MHz 1700 MHz Memory Bus Width 256 - bit 192 - bit Memory Type GDDR3 GDDR3 Memory Size 512 MB 384 MB
Both the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB and the GeForce 9600 GSO graphics cards use the NVIDIA G92 GPU .
Performance binning of the G92 GPUs results in two different grades - those with all 128 fully - functioning stream processors are labelled as the G92-400 and used in the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB cards , while those with at least 96 fully - functioning stream processors are labelled as the G92 - 150 and used in lower - end cards like the GeForce 9600 GSO .
Do note that some GeForce 9600 GSO cards might be using G92 GPUs will all 128 stream processors fully - functional .
This is because NVIDIA has to deliver their GPUs according to market forces and not entirely according to the speed binning .
So some , if not many , fully - functional G92 GPUs may end up getting used in the GeForce 9600 GSO .
That is not all though .
To properly mod a GeForce 9600 GSO into a GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB , you must look for GeForce 9600 GSO graphics cards that have 8 GDDR3 memory chips .
This is important as the GeForce 9600 GSO only requires 6 memory chips to achieve the memory capacity of 384 MB with a 192 - bit memory bus .
Therefore , most GeForce 9600 GSO cards only come with 6 GDDR3 memory chips .
The good news is there are some GeForce 9600 GSO cards that come with 8 GDDR3 memory chips .
To simplify production , some companies choose to produce a single PCB design with 8 GDDR3 chips , and then create two different products by choosing the GPU to use .
NVIDIA locked 32 of the 128 stream processors in the G92 - 150 , so by using that GPU , the graphics card turns into a GeForce 9600 GSO .
If the company wants to create a GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB card , they just need to use a G92- 400 GPU instead .
So , when you look for a GeForce 9600 GSO , make sure it has 8 GDDR3 memory chips .
That will give you a real good chance at modding the card into a GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB .
With that said , there is no way for anyone to know for sure if the GeForce 9600 GSO has faulty stream processors or merely had them locked for marketing purposes .
If you have such a card , then let 's proceed with the mod guide !

HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) --
The lawyer for a top Zimbabwean human rights activist said Friday that law has " absolutely broken down " in the country after a court in Harare ruled against her client .
Zimbabwean human rights activist Jestina Mukoko arrives at court in Harare , Zimbabwe .
The judge ruled Friday that the government should not be forced to disclose which state agents kidnapped and allegedly tortured activist Jestina Mukoko last month .
Mukoko , the head of the Zimbabwe Peace Project , is facing charges of plotting against President Robert Mugabe 's government .
Her lawyer had asked the High Court to squash the criminal proceedings against her until the kidnappers had been brought to court .
The lawyer had also argued that the information police were using against her client was sought while Mukoko was kidnapped , and said her client was denied treatment for her allergies while she was held .
But Judge Alpheus Chitakunya ruled against the motion , and the lawyer , Beatrice Mtetwa , said she was disappointed .
" The law has absolutely broken down in Zimbabwe , " Mtetwa told journalists outside the court .
" If a High Court can refuse to investigate an admitted kidnapping , refuses a patient a right to medical treatment -- to a place she can get treatment -- what else can we say ? "
Mukoko was abducted from her home in Norton , about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) southwest of Harare , at dawn on December 3 by state agents .
She was missing until December 24 , when she appeared in court .
At first , police denied the state had anything to do with the abduction and said they were treating the matter as a kidnapping .
In court , Mukoko was charged with recruiting people for banditry -- a crime that carries the death penalty in Zimbabwe .
Mukoko asked the High Court to order the police to treat her as a complainant , saying the police must investigate the kidnapping .
The court , while acknowledging the " admittedly unlawful kidnappings , " ruled against her .
" In effect , the High Court of Zimbabwe has said that if you are unlawfully kidnapped by state security agents , the court cannot look into the legality of that if some government minister invokes state security as a reason for not disclosing the abductions , where they took place and who did them , " Mtetwa said .
Mukoko had also sought an order to be taken to a clinic for medical treatment after her alleged torture during her detention -- a period during which she said she was denied access to medication for her allergies .
Judge Chitakunya ruled that Mukoko can go to a clinic for examination only .
Mukoko and other 31 others -- mostly activists from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change , but also a two - year - old child -- were kidnapped between October and December .
They are in police custody despite an earlier High Court ruling that they must be released to a clinic for medical treatment because they said they were tortured .
MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai has threatened to pull out of a power - sharing deal he signed with Mugabe in September if harassment of his supporters continues .

Asia Sentinel -- January 12 , 2009 -- Giles Ji Ungpakorn , a political science professor at Thailand 's Chulalongkorn University and a well - known socialist activist , has been ordered to appear at a Bangkok police station to be charged under the country 's stiff lèse majesté laws for insulting the country 's monarchy .
Ungpakorn has written a series of flame - throwing articles which have appeared in Asia Sentinel and Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal , among other publications , charging that a royalist and anti-democratic alliance made up of what he called the " fascist " People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , the military , the police , the judiciary , most middle - class academics and especially Queen Sirikit of perpetrating a royalist coup that kicked two democratically elected governments out of power .
As Thailand emerges gingerly from two years of political chaos that began with an September 2006 military coup against the democratically elected government of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , the government is increasingly using lèse majesté laws , the most restrictive known anywhere in the world , to stifle dissent .
Since the 1970s , the laws have grown progressively stricter .
Although the law is ostensibly designed to protect King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his family , it is increasingly being used to go after government critics , warranted or not .
Charges have been filed against several individuals including the BBC correspondent in Bangkok , Jonathan Head , for reporting on the political situation .
Ungpakorn said he had not been told which articles or speeches had resulted in the charge against him , but later said he was being charged over his book , A Coup for the Rich and added that he is prepared to fight any charges " in order to defend academic freedom , freedom of expression and democracy in Thailand " .
The summons is the result of a complaint filed by a Special Branch [ political police ] police officer , Lt Col.
Pansak Sasana - anund
The book was withdrawn from sale by Chulalongkorn and Thammasat universities .
However , Ungpakorn said all 1000 copies had sold out .
He directed readers to his blog http://wdpress.blog.co.uk/ and the International Socialist Tendency website in Britain , where the book is available in its entirety .
``I encourage people to read my book and judge for themselves whether I should face criminal charges over this book .
Relevant passages can be found in chapter 1 , pages 15 , 23 - 27 , and Chapter 2 .
My most recent academic paper on the monarchy appears on my blog .
It argues that the monarchy is not all powerful and that political and military factions claim royal legitimacy in order to boost their own power and interests .
Their recent actions may be bringing the institution of the monarchy into crisis because they have created an image of the monarchy being directly involved in politics .
I presented a Thai version of this paper at the National Thai Political Science Conference at Chulalongkorn University in December 2008 . ''
" The monarchy has been quoted and used by various political factions in Thailand to legitimise their actions " , he wrote .
" The most notable cases are the 19th September 2006 military coup and the illegal protests by the yellow - shirted PAD , which included shutting down the international airports .
Lèse majesté charges in Thailand are notorious for being used by different political factions to attack their opponents .
Many believe that this law is actually counter - productive to defending the monarchy .
This is why it is very important that political scientists attempt to analyse the real role and nature of the Thai monarchy in an atmosphere of freedom and democracy . "
The Committee to Protect Journalists has protested the use lèse majesté laws against the press , particularly against BBC reporter Head .
But use of the laws goes well byond just journalism .
In September , Australian novelist Harry Nicolaides , 41 , was arrested at Bangkok 's airport on charges that he had defamed the royal family in a 2005 novel when he tried to fly out of Bangkok to Australia .
He said he was unaware of the arrest warrant .
He remains in jail despite four appeals .
The blogger Bangkok Pundit in November wrote that police are handling another 30 lèse majesté cases including one against social critic Sulak Sivalak , who was arrested at his home in Khon Kaen in November for remarks he had made the previous December .
Among the most prominent charged was former minister in the Prime Minister 's Office Jakrapob Penkair , who in a speech to the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand in August of 2007 , criticised Thailand 's patronage system and particularly criticised Prem Tinsulanonda , the president of the Privy Council , a former prime minister and army general who is particularly close to the king .
Reporters Without Borders ranks Thailand 124th among 173 countries for restricting press freedom , recently expressing concern because 2300 internet websites were blocked in 2008 , in most cases for lèse majesté .
Ranongrak Suwanchawee , appointed information minister in the new Democrat Party government headed by Abhisit Vejjajiva , said on December 29 , 2008 , that blocking lèse - majesté websites would be her ministry 's main task .
Ungpakorn is an activist with the socialist Turn Left Thailand group , which is affiliated with International Socialist Tendency .
He comes from a family with an illustrious history of protest .
His father , Puey Ungpakorn , joined the Free Thai movement in the United Kingdom and parachuted into northern Thailand in 1944 but was captured by the Japanese .
Later ,
Puey became governor of the post - war Bank of Thailand before returning to the faculty of economics at Thammasat University .
Puey Ungpakorn was ultimately branded a communist and destroyer of unity by the political right .
He resigned as rector at Thammasat in protest against the October 1976 massacre of students by rightists and was forced to flee the country .
Press statement by Associate Professor Giles Ji Ungpakorn regarding lèse - majesté charges
January 13 , 2009 --
As you know , I have been summonsed to Pathumwan police station for questioning at 10.00 am on Tuesday 20th January 2009 .
I have been accused of lèse - majesté .
The charge arises from my book A Coup for the Rich , published in 2007 .
Those found guilty of lèse - majesté face a heavy prison sentence .
1 . The lèse - majesté Law in Thailand does not allow the for the proper functioning of a Democratic Constitutional Monarchy , since it restricts freedom of speech and expression and does not allow for public accountability and transparency of the institution of the Monarchy .
The Thai population are encouraged to believe that we live under an " ancient system of Monarchy " , a cross between a Sakdina , Absolute and Constitutional Monarchy system .
2 . The use of the lèse - majesté Law in Thailand is an attempt to prevent any discussion about one of the most important institutions .
It attempts to prevent critical thought and encourage a system of " learning by rote " among the population .
For example , once the Monarch has given his blessing to the " Sufficiency Economy " , we are all supposed to accept it and praise it without question .
Luckily , this type of brain - washing does not work very well in Thai society , for a society which cannot openly discuss economic and political policies will remain backward and under - developed .
3 . The Military often claim that they are the " defenders of the Constitutional Monarchy " , yet the Thai Military has a long history of making un-constitutional coups .
These are often " legitimised " by claiming to protect the Monarchy .
The 19th September 2006 coup is a good example .
Rather than defending the Monarchy as such , the military sought to legitimise themselves by referring to the Monarch .
The lèse - majesté Law is thus used as a tool by the military , and other authoritarian elites , in order to protect their interests instead of preserving the Constitutional Monarchy .
The promotion of an image that the Monarchy is all powerful ( an unconstitutional image ) , is part of this self - legitimisation by the military and other forces .
4. Constitutional Monarchs in most democratic countries enjoy stability while being subjected to public scrutiny .
Therefore we must conclude that the Thai lèse - majesté laws are not in place in order to bring stability to the institution , but serve another purpose .
5 . Those who charge me with lèse - majesté are doing so because I have shown a principled and unyielding opposition to military coups and dictatorships .
Many other activists are facing similar charges for the same reason .
We must not forget their plight .
We must wage an international and national political campaign to defend democratic rights in Thailand and for the abolition of the Lese Majeste law .
My book A Coup for the Rich
I wrote and published this book a few months after the 19th September 2006 military coup .
The book was an attempt to write an academic analysis of the Thai political crisis from a pro-democracy point of view .
While constantly criticising the Thaksin government 's gross abuses of human rights , I argued that the coup was totally unjustified .
I argued that those who supported the coup : the military , the PAD , disgruntled businessmen , neo-liberals and conservative civil servants , were united in their contempt for the poor .
They have no faith in democracy because they believe that the poor do not deserve the right to vote .
They also hate Thaksin 's party because it could win elections , while they could not .
Another important theme in my book is the questioning of the perceived " fact " that the crisis was a result of a dispute between the Monarchy and Thaksin .
It is this argument of mine that may have enraged the military most of all , since they wished to use Royal legitimacy for their coup .
I also attempted to stimulate a discussion about whether a Constitutional Monarchy should defend the Constitution and Democracy .
In another section of the book I tried to paint an historical account of the Monarchy and to argue that it is now a modern institution , not a feudal one .
I have now sold all 1000 copies of A Coup for the Rich , but it is available to download from my blog http://wdpress.blog.co.uk/ and from the International Socialist Tendency website in the UK .
Just after publication , the book was withdrawn from sale by Chulalongkorn University bookshop and later by Thammasart University bookshop .
I reject totally the accusation that I have committed any crime by writing and publishing this book .
I am prepared to fight any lèse - majesté charges in order to defend academic freedom , the freedom of expression and democracy in Thailand .
Since this accusation was filed by a Special Branch officer , the present Democrat Party government should be questioned about its role in this and many other cases .
The new prime minister has stated that he wants to see a firm crackdown on les majesty and many recent cases have been filed by the police .

After spending the past few years lambasting the Bush administration for holding suspected terrorists at the Guantánamo Bay detention facility in Cuba without charge or trial , European leaders now find themselves in a quandary .
Now that President Obama has ordered Gitmo shut down , he needs allied countries to volunteer to host the former detainees .
Trouble is , few European countries have made concrete offers to help .
European Union ( EU ) member states met today on the issue , but ( surprise ! ) failed to come up with a joint plan of action .
Der Spiegel reported that France had floated a proposal that EU countries offer homes to about 60 inmates who were deemed innocent but would risk persecution or torture if sent to their home countries .
' It 's a legal thing '
Karel Schwarzenberg , foreign minister from the Czech Republic , which holds the EU ’s rotating presidency , cited legal reasons as the main impediment to coming up with a joint statement , reports Bloomberg .
“ We ca n’t give a quick answer , ” Schwarzenberg told reporters after the meeting .
European leaders have had contrasting positions about what they ’re ready to offer .
Portugal , France , and non-EU member Switzerland have said they ’ll consider taking prisoners on a case - by - case basis , while Italy is open to the idea but wants a common EU position .
...
Germany has n’t decided whether to take prisoners , while the Dutch government has refused on the grounds that the U.S. should handle the situation .
The U.K. , which has accepted six of its nationals and four residents since 2004 , will “ offer our experience ” to EU allies , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said .
EU leaders " stressed that American authorities must show ex-inmates pose no security threat before they can be resettled , " reports the Associated Press .
But therein lies the rub .
If the detainees are deemed too dangerous to be hosted on European soil , should they then be set free to attack from somewhere else ?
If not , where then should they be held if the US detention facility in Cuba was so bad ?
" Not our problem , " say the Europeans .
" There is no question that chief responsibility to do with solving the problem of this detention center lies with those who set it up , the Americans themselves , " said German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
" But it is also a question of our credibility – of whether we support the dismantling of this American camp or not . "
Like herding cats ?
If that credibility is really at stake , the EU will have to overcome long odds to salvage it , given that the 27 - member EU has a hard time agreeing on most issues .
Here 's how the Monitor 's Europe Bureau Chief Robert Marquand put it in a recent article : " In an EU that is often characterized as divisive and dissembling on hard national problems , and that could not agree this freezing winter on how to collectively deal with gas shut - offs in the Russia - Ukraine dispute , the Obama team may have to be patient [ when it comes to who will host Gitmo prisoners ] . "
That virtue of Obama 's may well be tested soon .
As Monitor correspondent Caryle Murphy reports today , " two Saudis formerly jailed at the US prison camp in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , have joined Al Qaeda 's Yemeni branch , and authorities here worry that two other ex-Guantánamo inmates may have strayed back to militancy because they have recently disappeared from their homes . "
Gunmen opened fire Monday night at a checkpoint outside the US embassy in Yemen 's capital , Sanaa , the BBC quoted Yemeni officials as saying .
The clock is ticking .

GAZA , Jan. 9 ( UPI ) --
Hamas leaders say Mahmoud Abbas is no longer the president of the Palestinian Authority since his term expired Friday .
Abbas argues that he has the right to remain in office for another year because the law says presidential and parliamentary elections should be held at the same time , the Jerusalem Post reported .
Parliamentary elections are set for January 2010 .

Hamas officials said they do not expect Abbas to step down while the war continues in Gaza .
But they also deny his legitimacy .
" Thursday was Abbas 's last day in office , " said Osama Hamdan , who represents Hamas in Lebanon .
" Our position on this issue is clear : Abbas 's term in office has expired . "
Mushir al - Masri , a spokesman for the party in Gaza , agreed .
" He does n't have the right to speak on behalf of the people , " Masri said .
" He 's in power only because the Israelis and the Americans want him to stay . "
Abbas was elected in January 2005 .
A year later , Hamas won a parliamentary majority , although Israel and the United States refused to recognize its government .

As high street chains are hit by the economic downturn , independent retailers could also face problems .
People in Chelmsford in Essex are being encouraged to support the smaller businesses in the town to help them fight back .
Ben Geoghegan reports .
Israel ’s assault on Gaza , by air , sea and now land , has killed ( at the time of this writing ) more than 600 Palestinians , with more than 2,700 injured .
Ten Israelis have been killed , three of them Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire .
Beyond the deaths and injuries , the people of Gaza are suffering a dire humanitarian crisis that is dismissed by the Israeli government .
There is , however , Israeli opposition to the military assault .
Israeli professor Neve Gordon is chair of the department of politics and government at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in southern Israel , the region most impacted by the Hamas rockets .
Speaking over the phone from Beersheba , Gordon said : “ We just had a rocket about an hour ago not far from our house .
My two children have been sleeping in a bomb shelter for the past week .
And yet , I think what Israel is doing is outrageous . …
The problem is that most Israelis say Israel left the Gaza Strip three years ago and Hamas is still shooting rockets at us .
They forget the details .
The detail is that Israel maintains sovereignty .
The detail is that the Palestinians live in a cage .
The detail is that they do n’t get basic foodstuff , that they do n’t get electricity , that they do n’t get water .
And when you forget those kinds of details , all you say is , ‘ Why are they still shooting at us ? ’
That ’s what the media here has been pumping them with , then you think this war is rational .
If you look at what ’s been going on in the Gaza Strip in the past three years and you see what Israel has been doing to the Palestinians , you would think that the Palestinian resistance is rational .
And that ’s what ’s missing in the mainstream media here . ”
Gordon attended a large peace march last weekend in Tel Aviv with more than 10,000 other Israelis .
Longtime Israeli peace activist Uri Avnery was there .
He called the invasion “ a criminal war , because , on top of everything else it is openly and shamelessly part of Ehud Barak ’s and Tzipi Livni ’s election campaign .
I accuse Ehud Barak of exploiting the IDF [ Israel Defense Forces ] soldiers in order to get more Knesset seats .
I accuse Tzipi Livni of advocating mutual slaughter in order to become prime minister . ”
Israel ’s elections will be in February .
The assault strengthens right - wing Likud Party leader and former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a foremost hawk and leading candidate for prime minister .
While Netanyahu fully supports the attack on Gaza , his nephew , Jonathan Ben-Artzi , is an Israeli conscientious objector who was court - martialed and imprisoned for a year and a half .
He spoke to me from Providence , R.I. , where he is a student at Brown University .
“ I ’m speaking … not as anyone ’s nephew but … as an Israeli , trying to speak out to Americans to tell them you do n’t have to support Israel blindly .
Not everything that Israel does is holy … sometimes you have to speak firmly to Israel and tell us , tell our government , stop doing this . ”
Gideon Levy is a Jewish journalist with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz .
He told me : “ I think that Israel had this legitimacy to protect its citizens in the southern part of Israel … but this doing something does not mean this brutal and violent operation . …
I believe we could have got to a new truce without this bloodshed .
Immediately to send dozens of jets to bomb a total helpless civilian society with hundreds of bombs — just today , they were burying five sisters .
I mean , this is unheard of .
This can not go on like this . ”
But it is .
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency , UNRWA , in Gaza opened up schools to provide shelter , since Gazans , trapped in this narrow strip of land , have no place to flee .
Christopher Gunness of UNRWA told me that the agency provided the coordinates of the schools to the Israeli military .
Nevertheless , at least two schools have been hit by Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours .
Three people were killed at the Asma elementary school .
More than 30 are reported dead and more than 55 injured at the al - Fakhura school in the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza .
While Israeli planes drop pamphlets urging Palestinians to leave , the 1.5 million residents of the Gaza Strip , perhaps the most densely populated place on Earth , have no place to run , no place to hide .
Calls for an immediate cease - fire are ignored by Israel and blocked by the U.S. government .
It is not clear what the Obama administration will do — but the people of Gaza ca n’t wait until the inauguration .
There must be a cease - fire now .
And that ’s just the beginning .

LONDON — Waterford Wedgwood PLC , the maker of classic china and crystal , filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday after attempts to restructure the struggling business or find a buyer failed .
Four administrators from business advisory firm Deloitte were appointed to run the company 's businesses in Britain and Northern Ireland , while a Deloitte partner in the Irish Republic was appointed as receiver of Waterford Wedgwood PLC , the ultimate parent of the U.K. companies , and other Irish subsidiaries .
The U.K. joint administrators said they intended to continue to run the business as they seek a buyer .
Trading in the company 's shares was suspended on the Irish Stock Exchange where they languished at just one - tenth of a euro cent and the company 's directors -- including Anthony O'Reilly , the Irish publishing magnate who along with his brother - in - law Peter Goulandris owns more than half of all Waterford Wedgwood shares -- handed in their resignations .
" Waterford , Wedgwood and Royal Doulton are quintessentially classic brands that represent a high quality product which is steeped in history , " the administrators said in a statement .
" The administration team will be working closely with management , customers and suppliers during this time to ensure operations continue whilst a sale of the business is sought . "
Waterford Wedgwood , which employs around 7,700 worldwide , is the latest in a burgeoning list of iconic British companies to succumb to the global economic slowdown and credit squeeze .
Department store veteran Woolworths , the queen 's tailor Hardy Amies , tea and coffee merchant Whittard of Chelsea and fellow ceramics stalwart Royal Worcester and Spode have all filed for bankruptcy protection in recent months .
Wedgwood has been an iconic name in British pottery for 250 years , after its founder Josiah Wedgwood opened the first factory in Stoke - on - Trent , central England , in 1759 .
It began making bone china in the 19th century .
Waterford Crystal traces its lineage to a factory opened in Waterford , southeast Ireland in 1783 , although that business failed in the 1850s .
The brand was revived by Czech immigrant Miroslav Havel in 1947 .
Under O'Reilly 's watch , Waterford acquired Wedgwood in 1986 to form the present company , listing on the stock exchange and expanding overseas in the 1990s before buying fellow Stoke - on - Trent ceramics maker Royal Doulton in 2005 .
Much of the business has now shifted offshore , where it employs 5,800 people , including 1,500 people at a plant in Jakarta , Indonesia , which produces most of the company 's ceramics .
The majority of its crystal production has been handed to Eastern European subcontractors .
The company employs a work force just a third of that size at 1,900 in Britain , including around 600 in Stoke - on - Trent and 800 in Waterford .
Waterford Mayor Jack
Walsh said the closure of the crystal factory would deal a cultural and psychological blow to all of Ireland , noting that the crystal plant was one of the country 's top tourist attractions and the product " one of only a handful of iconic Irish brands . '
" Given this , it is of major strategic importance that this company not be allowed to slip into oblivion , " Walsh said .
In Stoke on Trent , Margaret Kilford was close to tears as she described how important Waterford Wedgwood was to the town .
" It 's part of Staffordshire .
It 's a very sad day , " she said .
" I 've always bought Wedgwood .
Nothing else will do .
If it goes , that 's it . "
The Deloitte administrators said the company has " benefited from significant shareholder support " in recent years as the management team tried to restructure the business .
O'Reilly and Goulandris have pumped more than 400 million pounds of their own money into the business since 2002 .
" However , as trading conditions deteriorated , it became apparent that a restructuring of the businesses could not be achieved in an acceptable timescale , " they said in a statement .
A subsequent alternative strategy to find a buyer also failed , they added .
Waterford Wedgwood chief executive officer David Sculley said he was " disappointed " about the bankruptcy filing , but remained confident a buyer could be found .
Under the administration process , administrators are appointed to salvage as much of the company as possible for the benefit of its creditors .
While they may do so by selling the company as a going concern , they can revert to a break - up to recoup as much money as possible from assets if a buyer for the whole business cannot be found .
The receivership process in Ireland follows a similar path .
Waterford Wedgwood announced last month that it had been forced to ask its chief creditors for " forbearance " because the company could no longer pay its loans on time or in full .
It also revealed falling sales and increasing first - half losses , and said its survival depended on securing new investment .

OSAMA BIN LADEN'S messages from the wilderness get little attention nowadays .
Al - Qaeda has been unable to land a blow on Western soil since the 2005 London bombings .
Its leaders lurk in Pakistan 's tribal belt , hiding from regular lethal attacks by America 's unmanned Predator aircraft .
Their Pushtun hosts are tiring of their troublesome guests .
Perhaps most damaging , former supporters publicly denounce its ideology .
The resultant bickering and low morale do not mean that al - Qaeda and its followers cannot still mount spectacular attacks .
Western intelligence services are convinced the group tried to blow up several transatlantic airliners in 2006 .
It can still pose a menace in , say , parts of Asia .
But for now , Mr bin Laden has to try to exploit the news , rather than to make it .
So it was with his last philippic , an audio recording issued on January 14th , in which he claimed that his jihad against America since 2001 had been responsible for bringing about the superpower 's economic collapse .
His followers would “ continue jihad for another seven years , seven more after that , and even seven more after . ”
The inauguration of Barack Obama , he said , changes nothing ; democracy is a form of “ polytheism ” .
The new president is “ like one who swallows a double - edged sword ” and will be hurt however he moves .
If he withdraws from his predecessor 's wars , Mr Obama suffers military defeat ; if he continues , he deepens the economic crisis .
Above all , Mr bin Laden sought to exploit Muslim outrage over Israel 's war in Gaza .
Forget about street protests , diplomatic mediation or treacherous Arab leaders , said Mr bin Laden ; the only way to defeat Israel was through jihad .
Jonathan Evans , the head of MI5 , Britain 's domestic intelligence service , is among those who worry that the war in Gaza will have radicalised more Muslims .
Yet Palestine is a problem as well as an opportunity for al - Qaeda .
It wants to be linked with the cause that is dearest to Muslims ' hearts , but it has little to offer .
Others have fought harder against Israel , chiefly Hamas , the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , and Hizbullah , the Shia militia in Lebanon .
But jihadists of al - Qaeda 's sort regard the Muslim Brotherhood as , at best , deviant .
By taking part in elections they place man 's law above God's .
And they see Shias as apostates .
Al - Qaeda 's failure to fight for Palestine comes up repeatedly in jihadist internet forums .
It also forms part of the latest ideological counter - attack against al - Qaeda by Sayyid Imam al - Sharif , one of its founders in 1998 and a leading jihadist ideologue under the pen-name “ Dr Fadl ” .
He has since fallen out with its leaders , particularly Ayman al - Zawahiri , who succeeded him as head of Egypt 's Islamic Jihad group .
Al - Qaeda , he now says , “ did not offer Palestine anything except words ” .
Dr Fadl was arrested in Yemen in 2001 and extradited to Egypt .
His first assault on al - Qaeda for its profligate killing of Muslims , at the end of 2007 , prompted Mr Zawahiri to write a rebuttal of nearly 200 pages .
The rejoinder to that , issued in November , was serialised in an Egyptian newspaper .
His latest critique ranges from personal attacks on Mr Zawahiri to accusations that al - Qaeda has distorted Islamic law on jihad and inflicted a series of disasters on Muslims .
Dr Fadl accuses
Mr Zawahiri of being an agent of the Sudanese intelligence services who agreed to carry out ten attacks in Egypt in the 1990s in exchange for $ 100,000 .
He denounces him as a liar and a coward who incites others to die in jihad while not taking part in the fighting .
Egyptian prisons and graveyards were filled with jihadists , but Mr Zawahiri fled abroad , he says .
Al - Qaeda blames America for all the woes of the Muslim world .
But Dr Fadl says the problem is Muslims ' own failings .
He accuses al - Qaeda of declaring entire populations , even in Muslim countries , to be apostates , and of establishing a “ criminal doctrine ” of wholesale slaughter .
This defies traditional injunctions in Islamic law against indiscriminate killing .
Even the killing of non-believers in war is restricted , he avers , pointing to the bans on killing women , boys , the demented and hired hands such as labourers and peasants .
The attacks on America in 2001 , says Dr Fadl , prompted foreign invasions and the destruction of the “ Islamic state ” set up by the Taliban .
It led to the death of more Muslims than have been killed in all of Israel 's wars .
“ Every drop of blood that was shed or is being shed in Afghanistan and Iraq is the responsibility of bin Laden and Zawahiri and their followers , ” he writes .
Their talk of Palestine is “ just for propaganda ” ; they cannot find allies among Palestinians .
Do the ideological revisions of Dr Fadl , facilitated by the Egyptian security services , matter when the assault in Gaza may have won al - Qaeda new supporters ?
Some officials argue that the emotional fury will pass ; they say Dr Fadl 's first attack hurt al - Qaeda even though it followed Israel 's equally brutal war in Lebanon in 2006 .
But pundits such as Bruce Hoffman , of Georgetown University in Washington , think the impact will be marginal .
“ Dr Fadl discomfits al - Qaeda , ” he says .
“ Young hotheads are not going to listen to some geriatric sitting in an Egyptian prison .
But al - Qaeda worries he might have an impact on its finances . ”
Counter - terrorism officials say that al - Qaeda is short of money .
Individual attacks may be quite cheap , but running an organisation — and supporting the families of members who are killed — is costly .
Tellingly , Mr bin Laden appealed for money in his last message , arguing that Muslims had a duty to wage “ financial jihad ” .
What better way to raise funds than to evoke the unending agony of Palestine ?

When examining exemplary Web designs that employ textures , you ’ll notice that textures are used in background images , headers , footers , sidebars , content areas and even fonts .
Although texture is sometimes associated with a grunge style of design , its reach extends far beyond just grungy websites .
Texture adds dimension to virtually any style of design , if applied properly .
In this post , we ’ll look at 50 examples of websites that use textures in different ways .

One of the reasons texture is so useful to designers and so popular is because adding it to a design can be quick and easy with a program like Photoshop .
Later in this article , we ’ll look at some of the different techniques you can use to apply texture to your own work .
Gallery : Texture in Modern Web Design
Now , we ’ll take a look at 50 websites in which texture has been applied to the design to improve it in some way .
The websites are categorized according to how the texture is used .
Many of the examples could fit more than one section , but they ’re categorized like this to show their diversity and to point out specific elements of the design .
Textured Backgrounds
When it comes to textures in modern Web design , background images are probably the most common area of use .
As you ’ll see in the examples below , a textured background image can easily be a significant feature in a design .
There are countless options for using textures in this way , and many designers are using creativity here to create stunning results .
Edit Studios
Many designers and studios use a dark background for portfolio websites , but Edit Studios gives its background some variety with a textured look .
The main content area has a few cracks in the background , and the rest of the design and background has a grungy style that ’s not overwhelming on the dark background .
Jobs on the Wall Web Designer Wall is well known for its colorful and artistic background .
The job board on WDW features a similarly creative but less colorful background with a textured approach .
The texture of the background resembles a cork board .
You ’ll see some design elements such as staples that help complete the bulletin - board look .
GoodBytes
The background image of GoodBytes includes different shades of purple overlapping each other , and a subtly highlighted area for the logo .
The result of these effects is a textured background that gives the website a much different feel than it would have with a solid single - color background .
Grace Church of Alexandria
While it ’s common to see wood backgrounds used for a textured look , brick backgrounds are a little less common .
The main content area of the Grace Church website is very clean , but it sits on a textured brick background .
Jason Bradbury Jason Bradbury ’s website contains multiple different backgrounds that appear randomly , most of which use some sort of textured look .
The screenshot below shows one of those images , a grungy British flag .
The texture gives the flag a completely different feel than it would have otherwise .
Doejo The Doejo portfolio website features a nice clean layout .
The entire website , except for the footer , has a slight texture , giving it a different feel .
Design Sponge
The main content area of Design Sponge is rather narrow , which exposes more of the textured background .
The image has a canvas - like feel in a neutral color .
Here ’s Life Mission Africa
The content area of Here ’s Life Mission Africa has a slight texture that may not even be noticed at first next to the dark background .
But at the bottom of that textured area is a torn edge that dramatizes the texture .
Bart - Jan Verhoef Bart - Jan Verhoef uses a textured background that gives the website an old - paper look .
In addition to the background , the text logo / website title also has a grungy , textured effect .
Church on the Rock Almost the entire website of Church on the Rock has a textured effect .
Some wood is used in the header image , and below that is the textured image shown in this screenshot .
Design Commission Design Commission is another website that uses a very clean content area with a textured background .
The background of Design Commission also includes a slight red color on the left side to give it some variety .
Creative Nights Creative Nights has a blue content area and a dark blue background with a textured effect at the top .
Lighting is used to spotlight the content area and darken the rest of the background .
Fall for Tennessee
All of the websites in the Tennessee vacation series are very well designed .
The Fall website features a textured , fall - colored background .
Carbonica Carbonica uses neutral - colored textures throughout the design of its website .
Headlines , icons and the navigation menu in the sidebar also used textured fonts .
Sollievo
The brown background for Sollievo has a subtle texture that would n’t stand out on its own , but combined with the torn - paper effect of the main content area , the website is left with a more substantial textured feel .
Gareth Dickey
The header and background of Gareth Dickey ’s website include an illustration .
The texture used in the illustration is subtle , but it gives a different look than the website would have otherwise .
Bright Creative Bright Creative , the studio of Dave Shea , uses textures throughout its design .
The header is a textured dark red , and the body is a textured neutral color .
NK’MIP Resort
The website of NK’MIP Resort has a grungy feel , with a dark textured background and a lighter textured content area .
Design Reviver
The dark textured background of Design Reviver eventually fades into a solid background lower on the page .
The white header also includes a slight texture in some areas .
Moustache Me Moustache
Me uses a dark textured background that ’s similar to the lighter cork - board effect used at Jobs on the Wall .
Images of tape and push pins are used to complete the cork - board look .
Textured Headers
Many websites use header images as a major part of the design and to stand out from other websites .
With a large space usually reserved for images , these areas have plenty of potential for dramatic textures .
As you look around at well - designed websites , you ’ll no doubt find many examples of textures being used in headers .
The examples below show just some of the possibilities .
Acceptance The Acceptance header uses blue and black with a textured effect in the background , especially on the sides where the colors are darker .
The navigation menu also has a similar texture on hover .
Slabovia.tv Slabovia.tv has a wood background to give the website some texture , but it also uses a textured header .
There ’s a coffee mug ring behind the header in one spot , and the website ’s tagline appears as a handwritten font on a piece of tape in the header .
Sienna Online
The content area of Sienna Online has a dark black background , but the header adds plenty of texture .
The header image has an old - paper look .
Electric Pulp
The light - colored background of Electric Pulp has a slight texture to it , but the one big spot that begins in the header stands out much more .
The logo / branding area also includes some texture .
Rocket Club
The background image of Rocket Club includes a dramatic header texture that significantly changes the look of the website .
The texture can also be seen through the somewhat transparent picture of the band .
Wandering Goat Coffee Company
The header of Wandering Goat Coffee Company has a canvas image to give it a striking texture .
The logo itself that sits in the header is also textured .
TheManInTheSea
The background image of TheManInTheSea gives texture to the header and to the sides outside of the content area , but it fades to white for readability of the content .
The Resume Girl
The website of The Resume Girl includes a few different textures in the header .
The white area has a paper texture , while the navigation menu has its own texture with a torn edge .
The green starburst area also includes a texture .
Thuiven
The Thuiven portfolio website uses a clean design that includes very little texture outside of the header .
The header includes some multi-colored stripes on a neutral background .
Sidebar Texture
While background images are often used to create columns for sidebars , textures in these images are not nearly as common as they are on full background images .
The websites shown below all make interesting use of textures in their sidebars .
A few different approaches are represented .
Napa Bar and Kitchen The Napa Bar and Kitchen website does n’t include a lot of textures .
The texture in the dark sidebar is n’t overpowering , but it ’s a nice addition to the design .
Rob Goodlatte Rob Goodlatte ’s website has textures all over the place , but the sidebar stands out a bit because it ’s not as common a way of using textures .
Sidebar design is often very basic and not a lot of thought goes into it , but Rob ’s sidebar draws more attention because of the look .
Branded07 Branded07 uses a dark - blue sidebar to contrast the light background color of the content area .
This dark blue includes a slight texture .
The same dark - blue texture is also used in the website ’s header .
Adventure Trekking Like the Branded07 design , Adventure Trekking ’s website does not use textures everywhere , just in a few select places .
The sidebar has a textured paper look with a torn and folded edge at the top .
Next to a light and untextured content area , the sidebar stands out a little more .
Textured Navigation Menus
Navigation menus can be one of the most visually interesting parts of a website .
Textures , of course , can be used in background images of menus to create a different and very attractive look .
You ’ll see several different approaches here , all using texture to improve a standard navigation menu in one way or another .
Matt Dempsey Matt Dempsey ’s portfolio website uses a background of orange brushstrokes .
The textured strokes are also integrated in the navigation menu of the website , and they have a lighter - colored brushstroke on hover .
Von Dutch Von Dutch features an artistic textured design for the entire website .
The main navigation menu is interesting because of the textured background images that are used .
Each link has a slightly different image .
Alpine Meadows
The Alpine Meadows website includes a few different textures , but the navigation menu is perhaps the most interesting .
The texture and the frayed effect make it a focal point of the design .
Blue Moon
The brick background of Blue Moon obviously gives the website plenty of texture , but the navigation menu also has a rusty texture in the background as well as in the font .
Astuteo
The Astuteo portfolio website is another example of a clean design that uses texture in a specific area for impact .
The header , which includes the main navigation menu , has a textured look that does a good job of contrasting the clean white background of the website .
Helmy Bern
The header area and navigation menu of Helmy Bern are extremely textured , with the torn - cardboard look at the top of the menu drawing the most attention .
Additionally , the sidebar has a similar texture .
The Ernest Hemingway Collection
The Ernest Hemingway Collection uses a desktop environment as a background , with the main content area sitting on top of the desk .
The navigation is a textured dark brown with a leathery feel .
Subtle Use of Texture
Some of the most interesting uses of texture are those that do n’t jump out and grab you .
Some designers are able to use textures in subtle ways that improve the overall look without being overpowering .
The examples below show attention to detail in design that gets great results .
Henry Jones
The portfolio website of Henry Jones makes use of textures but in a rather subtle way .
The border that surrounds the header and navigation area has a few very small spots where some texture is applied .
The gray bottom border of the logo / branding area does the same thing .
While these design elements do n’t stand out in the first few seconds of a visitor ’s time on the website , they provide detail that helps create a complete look .
Denver Seminary
Rather than having a solid - blue background behind the logo , Denver Seminary ’s website includes a soft texture in another shade of blue .
The texture adds some visual interest to the header and the logo .
College Park Church
The website of College Park Church uses several different textures throughout the website that work together to create a complete look .
The header includes some subtle textures in the background of the green bar , as well as directly below the bar where it meets the branding area .
The texture may not even be noticed at first , but it gives the header a look that fits the rest of the design , which includes some textures below .
Drew Dellinger
Rather than just having a solid black background , Drew Dellinger adds a slight texture to his website ’s background .
As with the other examples in this section , no one dramatic design element is present that grabs the attention of visitors , but the website is an excellent example of how texture can be used to subtly enhance a design .
Squarespace
The approach of Squarespace is very similar to that of Drew Dellinger .
The dark background is given a slight texture , which gives the website a different feel .
At Squarespace the texture fades into a solid background color as you scroll down the page .
Inca Un Calator
The design of Inca Un Calator is broken up vertically into a few different sections .
Each section has a slightly different color and texture combination .
The textures and the change from one section to the next are not drastic but really enhance the look of the website .
Aten Design Group Aten Design Group , like many other portfolio websites , uses a dark background .
However , the background is slightly changed by use of a subtle texture .
Different Ways to Add Texture to a Design
Applying a texture to a design can be accomplished in a number of different ways .
It ’s possible to create very similar end results using different approaches if you ’re comfortable and experienced with Photoshop .
Here are a few of the most common techniques for creating a textured website .
1 . Use a free stock image to create your own texture
One of the quickest and easiest ways to add texture to just about anything you create in Photoshop is to use a simple stock image and some layer effects .
Fortunately , there is no shortage of high - quality free textures , and there are even some premium options if you ’re willing to spend a little money .
David Leggett of Tutorial9 has a nice tutorial that shows how you can quickly add texture with a stock image .
If you ’re looking for free textures to use in your own work , some of the best resources are :
2. Create your own texture from scratch in Photoshop
Instead of using an image to create texture , you can get a very similar effect by creating one from scratch with no images .
If you know a few techniques in Photoshop , creating textures is not that difficult or time - consuming , and it may give you more control than using a found stock image .
There are a number of Photoshop tutorials that teach different techniques for creating textures .
Here are a few good ones :
Photoshop Paper Texture from Scratch then Create a Grungy Web Design with It
The Ultimate Wood Tutorial
3. Use Photoshop brushes
Photoshop brushes can be another quick and easy alternative to creating your own effects from scratch , and there are plenty of free brushes to choose from .
Brushes are great for adding grunge effects to a design , getting texture from brushstrokes and working with just about any other type of texture .
Free brushes exist for just about any type of texture you can imagine ; it ’s just a matter of finding the right one .
The ease of using free brushes makes it possible to experiment with all kinds of different approaches if you want to see what works best .
Here are some resources to help with that :
4 . Use ready - made textures
Rather than finding stock textures that can be used with your own work , you could buy some textured images to use as a background with little or no adjustment .
Many designers sell their work on stock websites .
Finding the right image for your work is not always easy , but if you find it , the price is pretty minimal for the amount of time you save .
5. Scan Textures
The scanning technique is similar to creating your own image in Photoshop from scratch , and it ’s also similar to working with free stock textures .
Essentially , you scan something , like a piece of textured paper , and then make adjustments to it in Photoshop .
If you ’re interested in this approach , Bittbox has an excellent tutorial on scanning paper and working with the texture in Photoshop .

Maisie Williams Upskirt of the Day
Posted in : Maisie Williams|SFW
DIGG THIS
First published in The Great Society Reader : The Failure of American Liberalism , 1967 .
The Great Society is the lineal descendant and the intensification of those other pretentiously named policies of 20th - century America : the Square Deal , the New Freedom , the New Era , the New Deal , the Fair Deal , and the New Frontier .
All of these assorted Deals constituted a basic and fundamental shift in American life  a shift from a relatively laissez - faire economy and minimal state to a society in which the state is unquestionably king . [ 1 ]
In the previous century , the government could safely have been ignored by almost everyone ; now we have become a country in which the government is the great and unending source of power and privilege .
Once a country in which each man could by and large make the decisions for his own life , we have become a land where the state holds and exercises life - and - death power over every person , group , and institution .
The great Moloch government , once confined and cabined , has burst its feeble bonds to dominate us all .
The basic reason for this development is not difficult to fathom .
It was best summed up by the great German sociologist Franz Oppenheimer ; Oppenheimer wrote that there were fundamentally two , and only two , paths to the acquisition of wealth .
One route is the production of a good or service and its voluntary exchange for the goods or services produced by others .
This method  the method of the free market 
Oppenheimer termed “ the economic means ” to wealth .
The other path , which avoids the necessity for production and exchange , is for one or more persons to seize other people ’s products by the use of physical force .
This method of robbing the fruits of another man ’s production was shrewdly named by Oppenheimer the “ political means . ”
Throughout history , men have been tempted to employ the “ political means ” of seizing wealth rather than expend effort in production and exchange .
It should be clear that while the market process multiplies production , the political , exploitative means is parasitic and , as with all parasitic action , discourages and drains off production and output in society .
To regularize and order a permanent system of predatory exploitation , men have created the state , which Oppenheimer brilliantly defined as “ the organization of the political means . ” [ 2 ]
Every act of the state is necessarily an occasion for inflicting burdens and assigning subsidies and privileges .
By seizing revenue by means of coercion and assigning rewards as it disburses the funds , the state creates ruling and ruled “ classes ” or “ castes ” ; for one example , classes of what Calhoun discerned as net “ taxpayers ” and “ tax - consumers , ” those who live off taxation .
[ 3 ]
And since , by its nature , predation can only be supported out of the surplus of production above subsistence , the ruling class must constitute a minority of the citizenry .
Since the state , nakedly observed , is a mighty engine of organized predation , state rule , throughout its many millennia of recorded history , could be preserved only by persuading the bulk of the public that its rule has not really been exploitative  that , on the contrary , it has been necessary , beneficent , even , as in the Oriental despotisms , divine .
Promoting this ideology among the masses has ever been a prime function of intellectuals , a function that has created the basis for co-opting a corps of intellectuals into a secure and permanent berth in the state apparatus .
In former centuries , these intellectuals formed a priestly caste that was able to wrap a cloak of mystery and quasi divinity about the actions of the state for a credulous public .
Nowadays , the apologia for the state takes on more subtle and seemingly scientific forms .
The process remains essentially the same . [ 4 ]
In the United States , a strong libertarian and antistatist tradition prevented the process of statization from taking hold at a very rapid pace .
The major force in its propulsion has been that favorite theater of state expansionism , brilliantly identified by Randolph Bourne as “ the health of the state , ” namely , war .
For although in wartime various states find themselves in danger from one another , every state has found war a fertile field for spreading the myth among its subjects that they are the ones in deadly danger , from which their state is protecting them .
In this way states have been able to dragoon their subjects into fighting and dying to save them under the pretext that the subjects were being saved from the dread foreign enemy .
In the United States , the process of statization began in earnest under cover of the Civil War ( conscription , military rule , income tax , excise taxes , high tariffs , national banking and credit expansion for favored businesses , paper money , land grants to railroads ) , and reached full flower as a result of World Wars I and II , to finally culminate in the Great Society .
The recently emerging group of “ libertarian conservatives ” in the United States have grasped a part of the recent picture of accelerated statism , but their analysis suffers from several fatal blind spots .
One is their complete failure to realize that war , culminating in the present garrison state and military - industrial economy , has been the royal road to aggravated statism in America .
On the contrary , the surge of reverent patriotism that war always brings to conservative hearts , coupled with their eagerness to don buckler and armor against the “ international Communist conspiracy , ” has made the conservatives the most eager and enthusiastic partisans of the Cold War .
Hence their inability to see the enormous distortions and interventions imposed upon the economy by the enormous system of war contracts . [ 5 ]
Another conservative blind spot is their failure to identify which groups have been responsible for the burgeoning of statism in the United States .
In the conservative demonology , the responsibility belongs only to liberal intellectuals , aided and abetted by trade unions and farmers .
Big businessmen , on the other hand , are curiously exempt from blame ( farmers are small enough businessmen , apparently , to be fair game for censure . )
How , then , do conservatives deal with the glaringly evident onrush of big businessmen to embrace Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society ?
Either by mass stupidity ( failure to read the works of free - market economists ) , subversion by liberal intellectuals ( e.g. , the education of the Rockefeller brothers at Lincoln School ) , or craven cowardice ( the failure to stand foursquare for free - market principles in the face of governmental power ) .
[ 6 ]
Almost never is interest pinpointed as an overriding reason for statism among businessmen .
This failure is all the more curious in the light of the fact that the laissez - faire liberals of the 18th and 19th centuries ( e.g. , the Philosophical Radicals in England , the Jacksonians in the United States ) were never bashful about identifying and attacking the web of special privileges granted to businessmen in the mercantilism of their day .
In fact , one of the main driving forces of the statist dynamic of 20th - century America has been big businessmen , and this long before the Great Society .
Gabriel Kolko , in his path - breaking Triumph of Conservatism , [ 7 ] has shown that the shift toward statism in the Progressive period was impelled by the very big - business groups who were supposed , in the liberal mythology , to be defeated and regulated by the Progressive and New Freedom measures .
Rather than a “ people ’s movement ” to check big business ; the drive for regulatory measures , Kolko shows , stemmed from big businessmen whose attempts at monopoly had been defeated by the competitive market , and who then turned to the federal government as a device for compulsory cartellization .
This drive for cartellization through government accelerated during the New Era of the 1920s and reached its apex in Franklin Roosevelt ’s NRA .
Significantly , this exercise in cartellizing collectivism was put over by organized big business ; after Herbert Hoover , who had done much to organize and cartellize the economy , had balked at an NRA as going too far toward an outright fascist economy , the US Chamber of Commerce won a promise from FDR that he would adopt such a system .
The original inspiration was the corporate state of Mussolini ’s Italy . [ 8 ]
The formal corporatism of the NRA is long gone , but the Great Society retains much of its essence .
The locus of social power has been emphatically assumed by the state apparatus .
Furthermore , that apparatus is permanently governed by a coalition of big - business and big - labor groupings , groups that use the state to operate and manage the national economy .
The usual tripartite rapprochement of big business , big unions , and big government symbolizes the organization of society by blocs , syndics , and corporations , regulated and privileged by the federal , state , and local governments .
What this all amounts to in essence is the “ corporate state , ” which , during the 1920s , served as a beacon light for big businessmen , big unions , and many liberal intellectuals as the economic system proper to a 20th - century industrial society . [ 9 ]
The indispensable intellectual role of engineering popular consent for state rule is played , for the Great Society , by the liberal intelligentsia , who provide the rationale of “ general welfare , ” “ humanity , ” and the “ common good ” ( just as the conservative intellectuals work the other side of the Great Society street by offering the rationale of “ national security ” and “ national interest ” ) .
The liberals , in short , push the “ welfare ” part of our omnipresent welfare - warfare state , while the conservatives stress the warfare side of the pie .
This analysis of the role of the liberal intellectuals puts into more sophisticated perspective the seeming “ sellout ” of these intellectuals as compared to their role during the 1930s .
Thus , among numerous other examples , there is the seeming anomaly of A.A. Berle and David Lilienthal , cheered and damned as flaming progressives in the ’30s , now writing tomes hailing the new reign of big business .
Actually , their basic views have not changed in the least .
In the ’30s , these theoreticians of the New Deal were concerned with condemning as “ reactionaries ” those big businessmen who clung to older individualist ideals and failed to understand or adhere to the new monopoly system of the corporate state .
But now , in the 1950s and 1960s , this battle has been won ; big businessmen are all eager to be privileged monopolists in the new dispensation , and hence they can now be welcomed by such theorists as Berle and Lilienthal as “ responsible ” and “ enlightened , ” their “ selfish ” individualism a relic of the past .
The cruelest myth fostered by the liberals is that the Great Society functions as a great boon and benefit to the poor ; in reality , when we cut through the frothy appearances to the cold reality underneath , the poor are the major victims of the welfare state .
The poor are the ones to be conscripted to fight and die at literally slave wages in the Great Society ’s imperial wars .
The poor are the ones to lose their homes to the bulldozer of urban renewal , that bulldozer that operates for the benefit of real - estate and construction interests to pulverize available low - cost housing . [ 10 ]
All this , of course , in the name of “ clearing the slums ” and helping the aesthetics of housing .
The poor are the welfare clientele whose homes are unconstitutionally but regularly invaded by government agents to ferret out sin in the middle of the night .
The poor ( e.g. , Negroes in the South ) are the ones disemployed by rising minimum - wage floors , put in for the benefit of employers and unions in higher - wage areas ( e.g. , the North ) to prevent industry from moving to the low - wage areas .
The poor are cruelly victimized by an income tax that Left and Right alike misconstrue as an egalitarian program to soak the rich ; actually , various tricks and exemptions insure that it is the poor and the middle classes who are hit the hardest . [ 11 ]
The poor are victimized too by a welfare state of which the cardinal macroeconomic tenet is perpetual if controlled inflation .
The inflation and the heavy government spending favor the businesses of the military - industrial complex , while the poor and the retired , those on fixed pensions or Social Security , are hit the hardest .
( Liberals have often scoffed at the anti-inflationists ’ stress on the “ widows and orphans ” as major victims of inflation , but these remain major victims nevertheless . )
And the burgeoning of compulsory mass public education forces millions of unwilling youth off the labor market for many years , and into schools that serve more as houses of detention than as genuine centers of education . [ 12 ]
Farm programs that supposedly aid poor farmers actually serve the large wealthy farmers at the expense of sharecropper and consumer alike ; and commissions that regulate industry serve to cartellize it .
The mass of workers is forced by governmental measures into trade unions that tame and integrate the labor force into the toils of the accelerating corporate state , there to be subjected to arbitrary wage “ guidelines ” and ultimate compulsory arbitration .
The role of the liberal intellectual and of liberal rhetoric is even more stark in foreign economic policy .
Ostensibly designed to “ help the underdeveloped countries , ” foreign aid has served as a gigantic subsidy by the American taxpayer of American export firms , a similar subsidy to American foreign investment through guarantees and subsidized government loans , an engine of inflation for the recipient country , and a form of massive subsidy to the friends and clients of US imperialism in the recipient country .
The symbiosis between liberal intellectuals and despotic statism at home and abroad is , furthermore , no accident ; for at the heart of the welfarist mentality is an enormous desire to “ do good to ” the mass of other people , and since people do n’t usually wish to be done good to  since they have their own ideas of what they wish to do  the liberal welfarist inevitably ends by reaching for the big stick with which to push the ungrateful masses around .
Hence , the liberal ethos itself provides a powerful stimulant for the intellectuals to seek state power and ally themselves with the other rulers of the corporate state .
The liberals thus become what Harry EImer Barnes has aptly termed “ totalitarian liberals . ”
Or , as Isabel Paterson put it a generation ago :
The humanitarian wishes to be a prime mover in the lives of others .
He can not admit either the divine or the natural order , by which men have the power to help themselves .
The humanitarian puts himself in the place of God .
But he is confronted by two awkward facts ; first , that the competent do not need his assistance ; and second , that the majority of people … positively do not want to be “ done good ” by the humanitarian … .
Of course , what the humanitarian actually proposes is that he shall do what he thinks is good for everybody .
It is at this point that the humanitarian sets up the guillotine . [ 13 ]
The rhetorical role of welfarism in pushing people around may be seen clearly in the Vietnam War , where American liberal planning for alleged Vietnamese welfare has been particularly prominent , e.g. , in the plans and actions of Wolf Ladejinsky , Joseph Buttinger , and the Michigan State group .
And the result has been very much of an American - operated “ guillotine ” for the Vietnamese people , North and South . [ 14 ]
And even Fortune magazine invokes the spirit of humanitarian “ idealism ” as the justification for the United States ’ falling “ heir to the onerous task of policing these shattered colonies ” of Western Europe , and exerting its might all over the world .
The will to make this exertion to the uttermost , especially in Vietnam and perhaps China , constitutes for Fortune , “ the unending test of American idealism . ” [ 15 ]
This liberal - welfarist syndrome may also be seen in the very different area of civil rights , in the terribly pained indignation of white liberals at the recent determination of Negroes to take the lead in helping themselves , rather than to keep deferring to the Lords and Ladies Bountiful of white liberalism .
In sum , the most important fact about the Great Society under which we live is the enormous disparity between rhetoric and content .
In rhetoric , America is the land of the free and the generous , enjoying the fused blessings of a free market tempered by and joined to accelerating social welfare , bountifully distributing its unstinting largesse to the less fortunate in the world .
In actual practice , the free economy is virtually gone , replaced by an imperial corporate - state Leviathan that organizes , commands , exploits the rest of society and , indeed , the rest of the world , for its own power and pelf .
We have experienced , as Garet Garrett keenly pointed out over a decade ago , a “ revolution within the form . ” [ 16 ]
The old limited republic has been replaced by empire , within and without our borders .
Notes
[ 1 ] Recent triumphal disclosures by economic historians that pure laissez - faire did not exist in 19th - century America are beside the point ; no one ever claimed that it did .
The point is that state power in society was minimal , relative to other times and countries , and that the general locus of decision making resided therefore in the individuals making up society rather than in the state .

The Best of Murray N. Rothbard
So what do you do if you find yourself in this age - old predicament , wrapped up in a man or a woman that is literally so far away it hurts ?
First of all , do n't panic , and do n't listen to the doubts of others - love is perhaps one of the strongest emotions we can experience as humans , and when it 's real , it does n't just dissipate as easily as the skeptics might have you believe .
Second of all - if you 've got the internet or a cellphone ( most people in this day and age do , and if you 're reading this , chances are you 've at least got some way to access to the web ) use it .
A little email telling that special someone just how special they are goes a long way toward keeping a relationship steady , and longer emails are a great way to really let someone know just how much you care .
But do n't stop there ; a good cellphone plan will get you free nights , weekends , and a big chunk of anytime minutes on the side , meaning you can leave each other short , sweet little messages or talk for hours on end about anything and everything without the big scary bills that come with land - lines .
Going a step further , a camera phone or , better yet , a cellphone with videophone capability can provide an additional sense of closeness , allowing you to actually see the one you love instead of just talking to them .
And hey , when it comes right down to it , there 's nothing wrong with going with the tried and true once in a while too .
There 's a certain something , a sense of permanence and sentiment that comes with getting a real letter on real paper delivered by a living , breathing member of the postal service ; sure , you can fire off an email and your sweetheart is sure to get it in ten seconds flat , but it 's still just a piece of digital flimflam on a computer , no matter how sentimental it is .
Taking the time to do something more traditional is always a great way to put a smile on your sweetheart 's face .
The burgers at the Cherry Hut restaurant in Beulah , Mich . , are a hit with customers .
But these are n't ordinary hamburgers .
Every summer , when tourists come to sample the state 's bumper crop of cherries , the restaurant 's co-owner Andy Case starts taking orders for the restaurant 's popular burger .
After broiling the patties in the kitchen , he slides them onto a bun and tops them with fixings .
It 's in this moment , before the first bite , that customers stir with anticipation because the Cherry Hut is home to an unlikely specialty – the cherry burger .
The burgers are filled with tart , or sour , cherries grown in northern Michigan – the cherry capital of the world .
Although people come to the Cherry Hut for the restaurant 's cherry pies , the cherry burger has become a popular seller and a conversation starter .
Mr. Case says he probably sells more cherry burgers than regular burgers .
" People want to be more health conscious , " he says .
The cherry burger is " tasty , juicy , healthier . "
A burger fit for Oprah
Adding cherries to burgers may seem a bit odd , but mixing tangy or sweet fruit with ground beef or poultry to form patties is becoming more common .
Donald Trump 's restaurants – the Mar- a - Lago Club in Palm Beach , Fla. , Sixteen in Chicago , and the Trump Bar and Grill at Trump Tower in New York – serve up the Mar - a - Lago turkey burger stuffed with diced Granny Smith apples and Major Grey 's chutney and topped with an Anjou pear chutney that contains raisins or currants .
It 's even turning the heads of celebrities .
On her daytime talk show , Oprah said the Mar - a - Lago turkey burger " may be the best turkey burger in the entire world . "
Ever since , the recipe has received praise on Internet message boards .
For Jeff O'Neill , executive chef at the Mar - a - Lago Club and the creator of this acclaimed burger , it 's been a " humbling " experience .
But his reason for creating this burger was simple .
" I never had a turkey burger that was good , " Mr. O'Neill says .
Usually , " they are dry .
They 're plain .
I wanted to have a burger that was juicy , flavorful , and refreshing all on its own . "
So O'Neill turned to fruit .
Inspired by a classic Thanksgiving combination – cranberries with turkey – and Palm Beach 's warm weather , he created a club favorite .
The apples provide a crisp , refreshing bite , and the chutney purée helps keep the patty moist , he says .
The benefits of adding fruit to burgers
Mixing fruit into burgers to add moisture is a big reason to do it , says James McNair , a cookbook author and head judge of the Sutter Home Family Vineyards Build a Better Burger ( BBB ) contest in St. Helena , Calif .
Since 1990 , Mr. McNair has been tasting and testing thousands of burger recipes from aspiring cooks .
Lately , he 's been noticing how often fruit sneaks its way into contest entries .
Last year , apples – diced and grated – as well as dried and fresh cherries and raisins were a common theme .
Tropical fruits also made an appearance .
The 2008 grand - prize winner 's burger featured papaya .
The Hawaiian - themed burger was topped with papaya , avocado , and watercress , but the fresh papaya mixed in the ground - beef patty made all the difference .
" The papaya enzymes are supposedly enzymes for the meat , " McNair says .
" It sure made a juicy , delicious patty . "
The art of creating a moist burger depends not only in the chosen ingredients , but the cooking time on the grill , he mentions .
" A lot of people have a tendency to overcook burgers and dry them out . "
But adding " fruit helps with that .
Plus , it adds nutrition . "
Middle Eastern cuisine often includes fruit .
Dates , apricots , and figs are common ingredients .
The savory - sweet combination is commonly found in Moroccan tagines .
In 2005 , it showed up in the BBB contest 's winning burger , which featured dried apricots and dates in a flavorful burger .
Adding fruit to burgers " adds a little moisture and a nice texture and a little sweetness . "
McNair says .
" And I think people are trying to get more fruits and vegetables into their diet . "
Although you may not readily find a fruit burger on most restaurant menus , McNair says , that 's no reason they wo n't start gaining interest from home cooks .
" We 're sort of ... starting the home trend [ now ] .
I think home cooks are more adventuresome than chefs . "
An Internet search turns up fruit burger recipes from amateur chefs featuring everything from pineapple to prunes .
Cookbook author Linda Dannenberg traces her fruit burger inspiration back to childhood .
She grew up in Newton , Mass. , where a favorite food was blueberry muffins topped with crusted sugar , a recipe from the Jordan Marsh department store .
This led to her trying many other ways to use blueberries .
As an adult , she collected her favorites into a book of blueberry recipes , " True Blueberry , " which includes directions for making blueberry salsa and a blueberry burger .
The taste of Ms. Dannenberg 's blueberry burger – a combination of beef and ground - up , freeze - dried blueberries – surprised even her husband and 21 - year - old son , who were hesitant to try the burger at first .
" Neither of them were enthusiastic about ... blueberries in a burger , " she says .
But the subtle , slightly sweet flavor changed their minds .
Adding fruit to meat is n't a weekly occurrence at the Dannenberg household , but she occasionally makes a cranberry turkey meatloaf loaded with a cup of dried cranberries .
" It 's the acidity that 's a nice complement to the richness of the beef , " she says .
Home cooks who are doubtful about stuffing a burger with fruit might want to try glazing burgers with jam , marmalade , or various chutneys , which form a sweet , " very nice exterior glossy , tasty finish , " says McNair , who occasionally cooks up his own fruit burgers at home .
Fruit burgers at school
Outside the home , fruit burgers are making an appearance in school cafeterias .
Several years ago , two or three Texas schools served blueberry burgers on a trial basis , according to Al Bushway , professor of food science at the University of Maine .
More recently , the University of Maine has been conducting research for a soy - based veggie burger made with blueberry purée , which they hope to market to the general public .
Cherry burgers have also made their way into the school lunch system .
In Cedar , Mich. , Ray Pleva , a butcher , has been selling cherry - meat products since February 1988 .
Recently , he 's been distributing cherry burgers to more than 400 schools across the US .
And like the Mar - a - Lago burger , Mr. Pleva 's cherry burger has appeared on the Oprah show .
The spark to start his business came after his daughter won a National Cherry Queen Competition .
To help bolster the cherry industry , he created his unique line of cherry - based products .
His company adds a cherry powder , made from ground - up tart cherries , to 91 percent lean , ground sirloin .
The powder is easier to distribute in the burgers than cherries themselves .
He touts the nutritional value of the burgers as well as the added moisture .
Adding cherries also doubles the shelf life , Pleva says .
Whether you add dried or fresh fruit , blueberries or apples , fruit burgers are on the cutting edge .
Currently , restaurant menus are touting gourmet burgers made from prized Kobe beef , ground brisket , or meat from short ribs .
Who knows ?
Perhaps fruit burgers will be next .
The late Mil­ton Fried­man was a provoca­tive teacher at my alma mater , the Uni­ver­si­ty of Chica­go .
He got his stu­dents involved with their stud­ies .
He was a gift­ed writer and com­mu­ni­ca­tor .
And he received a Nobel Prize for his con­tri­bu­tions to economics .
If I went before a town hall meeting in Vermont and asked if people thought it would be a good idea to abolish Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid , people would think I was crazy .
But Fried­man was more than an aca­d­e­m­ic .
He was an advo­cate for , and pop­u­lar­iz­er of , a rad­i­cal right - wing eco­nom­ic ideology .
In today ’s polit­i­cal and social real­i­ty , the Uni­ver­si­ty of Chicago ’s estab­lish­ment of a $ 200 mil­lion Mil­ton Fried­man Insti­tute ( in the build­ing that has long housed the renowned Chica­go The­o­log­i­cal Sem­i­nary ) will not be per­ceived as sim­ply a sign of appre­ci­a­tion for a promi­nent for­mer fac­ul­ty mem­ber .
Instead , by found­ing such an insti­tu­tion , the uni­ver­si­ty sig­nals that it is align­ing itself with a reac­tionary polit­i­cal pro­gram sup­port­ed by the wealth­i­est , greed­i­est and most pow­er­ful peo­ple and insti­tu­tions in this coun­try .
Friedman ’s ide­ol­o­gy caused enor­mous dam­age to the Amer­i­can mid­dle class and to work­ing fam­i­lies here and around the world .
It is not an ide­ol­o­gy that a great insti­tu­tion like the Uni­ver­si­ty of Chica­go should be seek­ing to advance .
Those who defend the Mil­ton Fried­man Insti­tute will assure us that it will encour­age a free and open exchange of ideas .
That may very well be true .
But if the goal of the insti­tute is sim­ply to do non-ide­o­log­i­cal research , there are a lot of names that one could come up with oth­er than that of the most polem­i­cal and ide­o­log­i­cal econ­o­mist of his time .
My sus­pi­cions only deep­en when I read on the Uni­ver­si­ty of Chica­go web­site that donors who con­tribute more than $ 1 mil­lion to the project will have a spe­cial rela­tion­ship with the Insti­tute as mem­bers of a Mil­ton Fried­man Soci­ety and will be expect­ed to facil­i­tate the institution ’s ​“con­nec­tions to lead­ers in busi­ness and government . ”
I work in Wash­ing­ton , D.C. , and I know about the pow­er that big mon­ey has over process .
When the insur­ance com­pa­nies and the drug com­pa­nies and the oil com­pa­nies and the banks and the mil­i­tary - indus­tri­al com­plex make con­tri­bu­tions to polit­i­cal cam­paigns , we usu­al­ly know exact­ly what it is they want in return .
Maybe I ’m being cyn­i­cal and maybe these big play­ers who are kick­ing in mil­lions for the Mil­ton Fried­man Insti­tute are mere­ly inter­est­ed in pro­mot­ing open aca­d­e­m­ic dis­cus­sion and research .
Maybe that is the case .
Frankly , I doubt it .
The tim­ing of this project is a lit­tle iron­ic .
Fried­man earned his bread by denounc­ing gov­ern­ment at vir­tu­al­ly every turn .
He , like his acolyte , for­mer Fed­er­al Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan , believed that a large­ly unreg­u­lat­ed free mar­ket con­sti­tut­ed the most supe­ri­or form of eco­nom­ic orga­ni­za­tion imag­in­able .
Well , the tune of the right - wing free mar­ke­teers has changed a bit in the last few months .
My col­leagues in the Sen­ate and I are now pick­ing up the pieces of a bank­ing sys­tem brought to the edge of col­lapse by this the­o­ry of dereg­u­la­tion and by the insa­tiable greed of a small num­ber of wealthy financiers play­ing in the mar­ket and engag­ing in incred­i­bly risky – if not ille­gal – behavior .
In the rush to bail out Wall Street , we saw Pres­i­dent Bush , Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Hen­ry Paul­son , the peo­ple in U.S. Cham­ber of Com­merce and the Busi­ness Round­table – folks who loved Friedman ’s ideas and who , no doubt , would be pre­pared to finan­cial­ly sup­port a Mil­ton Fried­man Insti­tute – reverse their long­stand­ing rhetor­i­cal oppo­si­tion to gov­ern­ment intervention .
Instead , they demand­ed that we come to the res­cue of the finan­cial firms that had lined up in front of Con­gress for their emer­gency wel­fare checks .
For years , all of these peo­ple , includ­ing the pres­i­dent of the Unit­ed States , have been telling us that gov­ern­ment should not be involved in ensur­ing health­care for all Amer­i­cans as a right of cit­i­zen­ship .
( ‘ What a ter­ri­ble idea ! ’ )
They have been telling us that the gov­ern­ment should not be involved in mak­ing qual­i­ty edu­ca­tion afford­able to all peo­ple , that the gov­ern­ment should not be empow­ered to ensure that we reverse green­house gas emis­sions , that gov­ern­ment should not reg­u­late pol­lu­tion that con­t­a­m­i­nates our air and water and land , and that the gov­ern­ment should not pro­vide a strong safe­ty net for our chil­dren , for our seniors or for the disabled .
Well , it turns out that when the shoe is pinch­ing their foot , they have become the strongest believ­ers in gov­ern­ment inter­ven­tion – espe­cial­ly if work­ing peo­ple and the mid­dle class are bail­ing them out .
But the issue here is not just eco­nom­ic pol­i­cy .
It goes deep­er than that .
It touch­es on the core of who we are as a soci­ety and as a peo­ple .
Are we as human beings sup­posed to turn around and not see the suf­fer­ing that so many of our broth­ers and sis­ters are expe­ri­enc­ing ?
Are we con­tent to be liv­ing in a nation where , thanks in part to the Fried­man­ite ide­ol­o­gy , the rich­est 1 per­cent owns more than the bot­tom 90 per­cent and the top one - tenth per­cent owns more than the bot­tom 50 percent ?
Should we ignore the real­i­ty that under Bush , more and more bil­lion­aires were cre­at­ed in a peri­od when we had , by far , the high­est rate of child­hood pover­ty in the indus­tri­al­ized world ?
Some 18 per­cent of our kids are liv­ing in pover­ty and we are shocked that we have more peo­ple in jail than any oth­er coun­try on earth , includ­ing Chi­na .
Are we sup­posed to ignore those realities ?
With all due respect to the late Mil­ton Fried­man , his eco­nom­ic pro­gram is noth­ing more than a wish list for the greed­i­est , the most monied inter­ests in our soci­ety .
At the same time that this ide­ol­o­gy is sup­port­ed by the rich and pow­er­ful – except when they ’re lin­ing up in Wash­ing­ton for their wel­fare checks – this same ide­ol­o­gy is almost unan­i­mous­ly opposed by work­ing fam­i­lies and mid­dle - class peo­ple across this country .
If I went before the peo­ple in a town hall meet­ing in Ver­mont and asked for a show of hands of how many peo­ple thought it would be a good idea to abol­ish Social Secu­ri­ty , Medicare and Med­ic­aid , peo­ple would think I was crazy .
Not one per­son in a hun­dred would sup­port that idea because it is so patent­ly absurd .
Even in the case of con­ser­v­a­tive Repub­li­cans , no GOP can­di­date would ever run on a plat­form of abol­ish­ing Social Secu­ri­ty , Medicare and Med­ic­aid .
They may attempt to abol­ish these pro­grams while in office , but they will nev­er dis­cuss that agen­da on the cam­paign trail .
What would some of the items on Friedman ’s wish list be ?
First of all , the Fried­man­ites would be sup­port­ive of the con­cept of a cul­ture of greed .
They want peo­ple mak­ing bil­lions of dol­lars on the cov­ers of Time and Newsweek because these peo­ple are sup­posed to be our nation­al heroes .
We are not sup­posed to rec­og­nize a teacher who makes $ 40,000 a year open­ing up the minds of young peo­ple .
We are not sup­posed to rec­og­nize a child­care work­er who makes $ 18,000 a year giv­ing poor chil­dren an oppor­tu­ni­ty to grow intel­lec­tu­al­ly and emo­tion­al­ly .
Those jobs are not con­sid­ered impor­tant work .
But if you ’re a bil­lion­aire on Wall Street cre­at­ing exot­ic finan­cial instru­ments that end up being worth noth­ing , you are con­sid­ered a hero .
The fact that this cul­ture of greed has per­me­at­ed our polit­i­cal cul­ture means that cor­po­rate CEOs can now earn more than 400 times what their work­ers earn with­out fear­ing a polit­i­cal backlash .
This wish list for the rich would include hav­ing the wealthy pay as lit­tle as pos­si­ble in tax­es .
It would include the destruc­tion of the Amer­i­can labor move­ment , abol­ish­ing the min­i­mum wage and doing away with reg­u­la­tions that ensure work­place safe­ty and keep our food and prod­ucts safe .
Now we have a case study for what hap­pens when the ide­ol­o­gy of Mil­ton Fried­man becomes the oper­at­ing ide­ol­o­gy of the gov­ern­ment .
Under Bush , the medi­an fam­i­ly income has declined by thou­sands of dol­lars .
Mil­lions of Amer­i­cans have entered the ranks of the poor .
Some 7 mil­lion have lost their health insur­ance .
Some 3 mil­lion have lost their pen­sions .
And the gap between the very rich and every­body else has grown much wider .
Right - wing econ­o­mists have argued that we can sim­ply trust wealthy peo­ple and large cor­po­ra­tions to do the right thing .
Recent his­to­ry has demon­strat­ed what a sil­ly idea that is .
Our coun­try is due for a trans­for­ma­tion .
We have endured years of right - wing ide­ol­o­gy and we are eager to move in a dif­fer­ent direc­tion .
I believe that we will see a major reorder­ing of social and eco­nom­ic pri­or­i­ties , and that this last gen­er­al elec­tion rep­re­sent­ed a repu­di­a­tion of right - wing eco­nom­ic arguments .
We will see the day when health­care is a right of cit­i­zen­ship in the Unit­ed States .
We will see a U.S. with­draw­al from Iraq and an under­stand­ing that nev­er , ever again can we allow an admin­is­tra­tion to manip­u­late and deceive its way into a war .
Our role as pro­gres­sives is to remind our coun­try that alter­na­tives are pos­si­ble , that social demo­c­ra­t­ic move­ments in North­ern Europe and else­where have secured uni­ver­sal access to qual­i­ty health­care and have effec­tive­ly abol­ished the kinds of pover­ty and home­less­ness we see in our soci­ety .
This will not hap­pen on its own : it will require pop­u­lar engage­ment and orga­ni­za­tion .
But the chang­ing polit­i­cal land­scape has pro­vid­ed us with an oppor­tu­ni­ty to advance the cause of social and eco­nom­ic justice .
In the Bush era – a peri­od in which some of Friedman ’s great­est admir­ers man­aged the U.S. econ­o­my – the top 400 fam­i­lies in this coun­try saw their wealth increase by $ 670 billion .
Yet we have chil­dren in this coun­try who have no health­care , chil­dren who are under­nour­ished and chil­dren who sleep out on the streets .
From an eco­nom­ic per­spec­tive , from a moral per­spec­tive and from a philo­soph­i­cal per­spec­tive , the ide­ol­o­gy of Mil­ton Fried­man is dead wrong .
And the Uni­ver­si­ty of Chica­go is mak­ing a seri­ous mis­take in estab­lish­ing a new plat­form for its failed ideas .
The BBC's Malcolm Brabant looks at why student anger erupted across Greece over the fatal police shooting of a teenage boy .
Young people have been clashing with police in cities across Greece
The riots that swept Greece underline why the most important day in the national calendar is " Oxi " or " No " day .
" Oxi " day commemorates 28 October 1940 , when Greek leader Ioannis Metaxas used that single word to reply to Mussolini 's ultimatum to allow Italy to invade Greece , propelling his nation into World War II .
When Greeks say no , they mean it in spades .
Rebellion is deeply embedded in the Greek psyche .
The students and school children who are now laying siege to police stations and trying to bring down the government are undergoing a rite of passage .
They may be the iPod generation , but they are the inheritors of a tradition that goes back centuries , when nuns would rather hurl themselves to death from mountain convents than submit to the ravages of Greece 's Turkish Ottoman invaders .
' Springboards for violence '
The centre for this December rebellion is the Athens Polytechnic , where students have been out on the streets with wheelbarrows and shopping trolleys to collect and recycle rocks and pieces of marble used in the previous night 's assaults .
The violence began in Athens and then spread to Thessaloniki The polytechnic is the symbol of modern rebellion .
On 17 November 1973 , tanks of the then six - year - old military dictatorship burst through the iron railings to suppress a student uprising against the colonels .
The exact casualty figure is still unknown to this day but it is believed that around 40 people were killed .
The sacrifice of the polytechnic was so significant that the post - junta architects of Greece 's new constitution drafted the right of asylum , which bans the authorities from entering the grounds of schools and universities .
That is why places of learning are the springboards for the current wave of violence and it also explains why many of the riots are in university towns .
Students and pupils have effectively been given carte blanche to carry on protesting , because their professors have declared a three - day strike .
' Out of control '
Although many of today 's protestors were not born when the polytechnic gates were crushed by the tanks , the lesson of the students ' martyrdom is a key component of every Greek child 's school democracy curriculum .
If Greece had already appeared difficult to govern , it will now will be out of control
Nikos Konstandaras , managing
editor of Kathimerini newspaper
The latent Greek contempt for the police , which has now erupted so volcanically , has its roots in the dictatorship , when the police were regarded as the colonels ' enforcers and traitors to the people .
The death of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos at the hands of an experienced 37 - year - old policeman has precipitated a wave of nationwide violence unseen since the dictatorship .
Whether it will lead to the fall of the unpopular conservative government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis is unclear .
It is premature to see the troubles as Greece 's reprise of the Paris uprising of 1968 .
One of the wisest observations has come from Nikos Konstandaras , the managing editor of Kathimerini , one of Greece 's more sober and respected newspapers .
In an editorial entitled " Anger 's teen martyr " , Mr Konstandaras wrote that Mr Grioropoulos ' blood would be " used to bind together every disparate protest and complaint into a platform of righteous rage against all the ills of our society .
" It will quickly become a flag of convenience for anyone who has a grudge against the state , the government , the economic system , foreign powers , capitalism and so on . "
" If Greece had already appeared difficult to govern , it will now be out of control . "

Here are our predictions for 2009 .
These are based on input from Andrew Appel , Joe Calandrino , Will Clarkson , Ari Feldman , Ed Felten , Alex Halderman , Joseph Lorenzo Hall , Tim Lee , Paul Ohm , David Robinson , Dan Wallach , Harlan Yu , and Bill Zeller .
Please note that individual contributors ( including me ) do n’t necessarily agree with all of these predictions .
(1) DRM technology will still fail to prevent widespread infringement .
In a related development , pigs will still fail to fly .
(2) Patent reform legislation will come closer to passage in this Congress , but will ultimately fail as policymakers wait to determine the impact of the Bilski case ’s apparent narrowing of business model patentability .
(3) As lawful downloading of music and movies continues to grow , consumer satisfaction with lossy formats will decline , and higher - priced options that offer higher fidelity will begin to predominate .
At least one major online music service will begin to offer music in a lossless format .
(4) The RIAA ’s “ graduated response ” initiative will sputter and die because ISPs are unwilling to cut off users based on unrebutted accusations .
Lawsuits against individual end - user infringers will quietly continue .
(5) The DOJ will bring criminal actions against big - time individual copyright infringers based on data culled from the server logs of a large “ private ” BitTorrent community .
(6) Questions over the enforceability of free / open source software licenses will move closer to resolution .
(7) NebuAd and the regional ISPs recently sued for deploying NebuAd ’s advertising system will settle with the class action plantiffs for an undisclosed sum .
At least in part because of the lawsuit and settlement , no U.S. ISP will deploy a new NebuAd / Phorm - like system in 2009 .
Meanwhile , Phorm will continue to be successful with privacy regulators in the UK and will sign up reluctant ISPs there who are facing competitive pressure .
Activists will raise strong objections to no avail .
(8) The federal Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will hear oral argument in the case of U.S. v. Lori Drew , the Megan Meier / MySpace prosecution .
By year ’s end , the Ninth Circuit panel still will not have issued a decision , although after oral argument , the pundits will predict a 3 - 0 or 2 - 1 reversal of the conviction .
(9) As a result of the jury ’s guilty verdict in U.S. v. Lori Drew , dozens of plaintiffs will file civil lawsuits in 2009 alleging violations of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act premised on the theory that one can “ exceed authorized access ” or act “ in excess of authorization ” by violating Terms of Service .
Thankfully , the Department of Justice wo n’t bring any other criminal cases premised on this theory , at least not until it sees how the Ninth Circuit rules .
( 10 ) The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( CFAA ) will be the new DMCA .
Many will argue that the law needs to be reformed , but this argument will struggle to gain traction with the lay public , notwithstanding the fact that lay users face potential liability for routine behaviors due to CFAA overbreadth .
( 11 ) An academic security researcher will face prosecution under the CFAA , anti wire tapping laws , or other computer intrusion statutes for violations that occurred in the process of research .
( 12 ) An affirmative action lawsuit will be filed against a university , challenging the use of a software algorithm used in evaluating applicants .
( 13 ) There will be lots of talk about net neutrality but no new legislation , as everyone waits to see how the Comcast / BitTorrent issue plays out in the courts .
( 14 ) The Obama administration will bring an atmosphere of antitrust enforcement to the IT industry , but no major cases will be brought in 2009 .
( 15 ) The new administration will be seen as trying to “ reboot ” the FCC .
( 16 ) One of the major American voting system manufacturers ( Diebold / Premier , Sequoia , ES&S , or Hart InterCivic ) will go out of business or be absorbed into one of its rivals .
( 17 ) The federal voting machine certification regime will increasingly be seen as a failure .
States will strengthen their own certification processes , and at least one major state will stop requiring federal certification .
The failure of the federal process to certify systems or software patches in a timely fashion will be cited as a reason for this move .
( 18 ) Estonia and other countries will continue experimenting in real elections with online or mobile phone voting .
They will claim that these trials are successful because “ nothing went wrong . ”
Security analysts will continue to claim that these systems are fundamentally flawed and will continue to be ignored .
Exactly the same thing will continue to happen with U.S. overseas and military voters .
( 19 ) We ’ll see the first clear - cut evidence of a malicious attack on a voting system fielded in a state or local election .
This attack will exploit known flaws in a “ toe in the water ” test and vendors will say they fixed the flaw years ago and the new version is in the certification pipeline .
( 20 ) U.S. federal government computers will suffer from at least one high - profile compromise by a foreign entity , leaking a substantial amount of classified or highly sensitive information abroad .
( 21 ) There will be one or more major Internet outages attributed to attacks on DNS , BGP , or other Internet plumbing that is immediately labeled an act of “ cyber - warfare ” or “ cyber- terrorism . ”
The actual cause will be found to be the action of spammers or other professional Internet miscreants .
( 22 ) Present flaws in the web ’s Certification Authority process , such as the MD5 issue or the leniency of some CAs in issuing certificates , will lead to regulation of the CA process .
Among other things , there will be calls for restrictions on which CAs can issue certs for which Top Level Domains .
( 23 ) One or more major Internet services or top - tier network providers will experience prolonged failures and / or unrecoverable data severe enough that the company ’s president ends up testifying before Congress about it .
( 24 ) Shortly after the start of the new administration , the TSA will quietly phase out the ban on flying with liquids or stop enforcing it in practice .
The color - coded national caution levels ( which have remained at “ orange ” forever ) will be phased out .
( 25 ) All 20 of the top 20 U.S. newspapers by circulation will experience net reductions in their newsroom headcounts in 2009 .
At least 15 of the 20 will see weekday circulation decline by 15 % or more over the course of the year .
By the end of the year , at least one major U.S. city will lack a daily newspaper .
( 26 ) Advertising spending in older media will plummet , but online ad spending will be roughly level , as advertisers warm to online ads whose performance is more easily measured .
Traditional media will be forced to offer advertisers fire sale prices , and the ratio of content to advertising in many traditional media outlets will increase .
( 27 ) An embarrassing leak of personal data will emerge from one or more of the social networking firms ( e.g. , Facebook ) , leading Congress to consider legislation that probably wo n’t solve the problem and will never actually reach the floor for a vote .
( 28 ) Facebook will be sold for $ 4 billion and Mark Zuckerberg will step down as CEO .
( 29 ) Web 2.0 startups will not be hammered by the economic downtown .
In fact , web 2.0 innovation may prove to be countercyclical .
Costs are controllable : today ’s workstyles do n’t require lavish office space , marketing can be viral , and pay - as - you - go computing services eliminate the need for big upfront investments in infrastructure .
Laid off big-company workers and refugees from the financial world will keep skilled wages low .
The surge in innovation will be real , but its effects will mostly be felt in future years .
( 30 ) The Blu-ray format will increasingly be seen as a failure as customers rely more on online streaming .
( 31 ) Emboldened by Viacom ’s example against Time Warner , TV network owners will increasingly demand higher payments from cable companies with the threat of moving content online instead .
Cable companies will attempt to more heavily limit the content that network owners can host on Hulu and other sites .
( 32 ) The present proliferation of incompatible set - top boxes that aim to connect your TV to the Internet will lead to the establishment of a huge industry consortium with players from three major interest groups ( box builders , content providers , software providers ) , reminiscent of the now - defunct SDMI consortium , and with many of the same members .
In 2009 , they will generate a variety of press releases but will accomplish nothing .
( 33 ) A hot Christmas item will be a cheap set - top box that allows normal people to download , organize , and view video and audio podcasts in their own living rooms .
This product will work with all of the major free online sources of audio and video , and a few of the paid sources .
( 34 ) Internet Explorer ’s usage share will fall below 50 percent for the first time in a decade , spurred by continued growth of Firefox and Safari and deals with OEMs to pre-load Google Chrome .
( 35 ) Somebody besides Apple will sell an iPod clone that ’s a drop - in replacement for a real iPod , complete with support for iTunes DRM , video playback , and so forth .
Apple will sue ( or threaten to sue ) , but wo n’t be able to stop distribution of this product .
( 36 ) Apple will release a netbook , which will be a souped - up iPhone with an 8 ″ screen and folding keyboard .
It will sell for $ 899 .
( 37 ) No white space devices will be approved for use by the FCC .
Submitted spectrum sensing devices will fare well in both laboratory and field tests , but approval will be delayed politically by the anti-white space lobby .
( 38 ) More and more Internet traffic will encrypted , as concern grows about eavesdropping , content modification , filtering , and security attacks .

I 've been building a Linux package dependency visualizer with Python and the JavaScript Infovis Toolkit that gathers all dependencies for a linux package and displays them in an interactive tree visualization .
So , let 's say your query isand you want to see dependencies for that package .
The visualization will displayas the centered node , laying its dependencies on outer concentric circles like this :
By clicking onyou'll set this node as root :
Then , the visualization will query fordependencies , morphing its state into the new node 's perspective :
You can play with the example here .
I 'll explain how to build this in case you want your own at home .
I guess this is going to be also a nice tutorial on how to configure the RGraph visualization to run advanced examples , including the new morphing animations in version 1.0.7a
Server side we need to build a service that can transform theoutput for package dependencies into a JSON tree structure .
Theis a linux tool ( which you can install with apt - get install apt- rdepends ) that displays a hierarchy of package dependencies for a given package .
Here 's an example when querying for You can either useorto fetch the output for a system call in Python , I 'll do the latter .
The main function that makes the system call and returns the answer could be something like this :
Thefunction will create the tree structure that will then be serialized into JSON to be processed client side .
We will first need afunction that creates a tree node structure from a package 's name :
As you can see , this is the same tree node as the JSON tree structure defined for the JIT Ourfunction will receive as formal parameters the root package , the response from thecall , an integer that will specify the max depth for the tree ( in case we want to prune it to some level ) and an id prefix that will be set for each node :
As you can see , recursively creates nodes and appends them to their parent children property .
Finally , I also made afunction that retrieves all children for a given package , parsing source :
If you used , then you could expose your service in the views .
py file like this :
All the JavaScript Infovis Toolkit visualizations are customizable via controller methods .
If this is the first time you use this library , perhaps it would be better to start with the RGraph quick tutorial first .
First we define a simple Log object , that will write the current state of the graph to a label ( like loading ... or stuff like that ) .
I 'll use Mootools , but you can use whatever you want .
Then we can define an init function , that instanciates the RGraph object and returns it .
We will pass a controller to this object , that implements theandmethods .
I 'll also define some utility methods , likeandadvanced example .
You can always go to a simpler example to begin here .
Finally we have to initialize the visualization when the page loads , so we 'll attach an initialization function like this :
These are the HTML and CSS files I used to make this example / tutorial .
The HTML : You'll probably have to change the path to the CSS and JavaScript files .
and the CSS file : Although still in alpha , the JavaScript Infovis Toolkit can be used to perform advanced animations , customizing your visualization via a controller and not messing with the code .
This example also shows that it can be used to do more advanced things that only plotting static animations , interacting with services and handling pretty well visualizations where the dataset changes over time .
You can download the library here , latest version is 1.0.7a .
You can also go to the main project page to know more .
Hope it was useful .
Feel free to post any comment or questions .

' Very Different ' Team Fortress 2 Mode Coming ' Soon '
" A new Payload map is in the works , more community maps are on the way and the team will soon unveil a very different new game mode , " writes The Escapist in a story on Walker and the team at Valve .
Walker also revealed that while the team is primarily focusing on bolstering the game 's existing classes , it does have a running list of candidates for an entirely new class .
" We 've got several new class designs floating around , some of which we like a lot , but right now we 're focusing on the broadening of our existing classes through the addition of the unlockables , " said Walker .
Absent parents could be stopped from driving Absent parents who do not pay child support could have their passports and driving licences seized without having to be taken to court .
The Department for Work and Pensions said the proposals contained in the Welfare Reform Bill would be a " last resort " if other sanctions failed .
Latest estimates suggest absent parents owe nearly £ 4bn in unpaid maintenance .
But opponents say the government 's plans could lead to breaches of parents ' civil rights .
' Tough times '
The Child Support Agency can confiscate the driving licences of parents who refused to pay for their children , but it had to apply for a court order to do so .
Last year , Parliament passed an act giving the body which oversees the CSA and is developing its successor - the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission ( CMEC ) - the same power in relation to passports .
The new legislation would allow the CMEC to bypass the courts and confiscate absent parents ' passports and driving licences until the money is paid in full .
The government is debating welfare reform whilst standing on the burning ship
Frank Field , Labour MP
Reaction to child support plans
The government argues that this is " faster , simpler and easier for the taxpayer " .
Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell said : " We are supporting parents in these tough times , but for those who choose not to support their own kids , we will not stand by and do nothing .
" If a parent refuses to pay up then we will stop them travelling abroad or even using their car .
" We want fair rules for everybody and that means giving people the support they need , but in return expecting them to live up to their responsibilities . "
Janet Allbeson , from the one - parent family advisory group Gingerbread , told the BBC she supported the idea as a last resort .
" Over half of all children in single - parent households are poor .
And we know , because Parliament has told us , that if all non-resident parents who are required to pay money each week by the Child Support Agency did so it would lift an extra 100,000 children out of poverty . "
' Talking tough '
The government says the new plan will be tested in certain areas of the country .
Similar schemes in the US and Australia have been successful in increasing payments .
Other powers open to the CMEC include taking money from a bank account without going through the courts ; applying for a curfew , or recovering money from a dead person 's estate .
Opponents are worried that civil liberties may be undermined if bureaucrats have the power to take away passports and driving licences .
The Liberal Democrats have also criticised the plans .
Time limit Work and pensions spokesman Steve Webb said : " This latest bill will have more talking tough , but we 've heard it all before .
" What we really need is an efficient , effective system and this bill is n't going to bring it in . "
The Welfare Reform Bill also includes measures to require many single parents and people on incapacity benefit to seek work .
But Labour MP and former welfare reform minister Frank Field said : " The government is debating welfare reform whilst standing on the burning ship . "
He is calling for a time limit on benefits for under - 25s who have never worked .
In a report for the Reform think - tank he also advocates the National Insurance system being reformed so that employees with a longer record of work receive more contribution - based Jobseeker 's Allowance if made redundant .

Internet Explorer is hemorrhaging user like blood from a one - legged knight , but , like the stubborn knight of Monty Python fame , it is n’t dead just yet .
The latest numbers show Internet Explorer closing out the year with a 68.15 percent share of the web browser market — still the majority of web users , but down significantly from its starting point of roughly 75 percent back in January of 2008 .
The three major browsers profiting from IE ’s dwindling numbers are Firefox , Safari and Chrome , which all saw a jump in users during December .
Google ’s Chrome browser even managed to top the 1 percent mark for the first time — not bad for a browser that ’s barely out of the beta stage stage .
Of course browser share is a notoriously slippery number — every survey reports slightly different numbers — and web metrics vendor Net Applications cautions that these latest numbers are preliminary and have not been fully reviewed .
Still , even allowing for certain errors , things do n’t look good for the future of Microsoft ’s web browser .
The question for Microsoft is whether or not the coming Internet Explorer 8 will help turn the tide of defectors .
The next revision promises a number of enhancements , including private browsing features , a better bookmark manager , a much more standards - friendly rendering engine and more .
But nearly all the features slated to arrive in IE 8 are already available today in its competitors .
It seems likely that , while IE 8 might mean that Internet Explorer has temporarily caught up with the rest , those who have already left IE will have little reason to return to the Microsoft fold .
One the other hand , for those still using Internet Explorer , IE 8 coulld offer enough in the way of improvements to make them stick around .
And with IE losing perhaps as much as 7 percent of its users in the last year , winning new converts would be nice , but even slowing the losses probably looks pretty good to Microsoft .
If the current defection rates shown in Net Application ’s survey continue , Internet Explorer will drop below 50 percent in just over two years .

I took a pre employment polygraph seven years ago and although I " passed " I can say it was a horrible experience , so much so I still cringe to this day .
I can remember coming out of it feeling like a complete piece of s#$t and feeling that I had no business even considering becoming a cop .
I did not get the job but with perseverance I got on later with another department ( with no polygraph required ) .
I have since conducted investigations where I have asked subjects to submit to a polygraph .
In my experience I have spoken at length with polygraphers and observed many polygraphs .
I have come to the opinion that the polygraph procedure is ONLY useful in eliciting confessions , due to the fact that most are scared sh#@less and have been psychologically destroyed and as a result confess .
Although I have not seen false confessions ( I sincerely hope ) I have seen some deemed deceptive when really not and as a result their name and credibility destroyed .
One especially comes to mind .
The file was a theft of a laptop computer .
The person was a suspect due to right time , place and opportunity .
I observed the polygraph and saw the man psychologically destroyed by the process , with his results being deceptive .
Basically he was accused as being a liar and a thief which had major job consequences .
Approx six months later the computer was found stored in a closet in the place of employment , he had " NOTHING TO DO WITH IT " .
It did not matter , the damage was done .
His credibility was long since destroyed .
I am looking to change employers , however I will never submit to another polygraph exam .
They are junk and the risks are to high .
It saddens me to see how this junk science is being used and lives destroyed .
Nazi Israel … Indeed
By Elias Akleh
Richard Falk , the professor of international law at Princeton University and the UN ’s special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories , had accused Israel of violating international law , international humanitarian laws , and the Geneva Convention .
He described Israel ’s policies against Palestinians and its siege of Gaza as “ war crimes ” , “ genocidal tendencies ” , “ holocaust implications ” , and “ holocaust - in - the - making ” .
He urged the International Criminal Court to look into the possibility of indicting Israeli leaders for war crimes .
Professor Falk had a little taste of Israel ’s Nazi - like crimes and human rights violation when he traveled to Israel , last Sunday December 14th , 2008 , to visit the Occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to report on Israel ’s compliance with human rights standards and international humanitarian law .
The Israelis “ detained ” Professor Falk at the airport , treated his as a criminal and a threat to the state , humiliated him and deported him next day back to Geneva .
Despite Israel ’s strong declaration that every Jew in the world is automatically granted full Israeli citizenship with all the protections this entails , and despite being a Jew himself , Professor Falk was not spared the humiliations and cruelty Israel treats its enemies with .
Emboldened by the American blind and unconditional support , defiant Israel wanted to publicly give its finger to Falk and to the UN he represents , declaring itself above all international laws and above any criticism of its crimes and human rights violations even if such criticism comes from a Jew himself .
Such defying humiliation of the world political body is meant to distract the UN , and thus the whole world , away from the holocaust it is perpetrating against the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza , and all its on - going war crimes against the rest of Palestinians throughout the whole Palestine .
Falk ’s accusations of Israel ’s Nazi - like holocaustal implications are no different from those made by John Dugard , his predecessor , in several reports on conditions in occupied Palestine .
Many conscientious political figures , as well as regular citizens , around the world had described Israel ’s policies in occupied Palestine in specific and in the Middle East in general as war crimes and threat to world peace .
Comparing the present - day Israel with Nazi Germany one discovers that the majority of the Israeli policies are the exact copies of the Nazi policies .
Nazi Germany had invaded its European neighbors extending from England to Russia .
Israel had also invaded all its neighboring countries ; Egypt , Jordan , Syria , and Lebanon .
It is also heavily involved in the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Its tentacles had also reached African countries as far as South Africa , Somalia , Sudan , Angola , and Sierra Leone .
Nazi war machines used to invade resisting towns , line up the men in the center of the town to be executed in cold blood , and destroyed the whole town as a deterring example for any possible other resisting towns .
Worse than the Nazis Israeli forces used to invade peaceful Palestinian towns , execute men , women and children in cold blood everywhere and anywhere they encounter them , dynamite their homes on top of their residents , and finally demolish the whole town making room for new Israeli colonies .
Throughout 1948 / 49 Israelis had committed 70 ugly massacres against Palestinian villagers , and totally destroyed 675 Palestinian towns and villages including their churches and mosques .
Such massacres and demolitions followed a set pattern , repeated in one village after the other , indicating a pre-meditated genocidal plan .
In the words of the late Israeli General Moshe Dayan : “ The declaration of the State of Israel in 1948 was at the expense of ethnically cleansing 513 Palestinian villages , creating over 700,000 Palestinian refugees and expropriating their lands , homes and businesses in 78 % of Palestine …
There is not one single place built in this country that did not have a former ( Palestinian ) population . ”
Israel is , still up till today , carrying these same genocidal Nazi - like holocaustal crimes gradually choking 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza to death by starvation , thirst , lack of fuel and disease .
Israeli army is in the process of demolishing 40 Palestinian villages in the Negev desert .
Army bulldozers are daily destroying Palestinian homes in major Palestinian cities such as Jerusalem , Bethlehem , Hebron , Ramallah , and Nablus .
The Nazi army perpetrated many massacres against prisoners of war .
They used to execute prisoners and dump them in graves the prisoners where ordered to dig for themselves .
The Israeli army followed the same method of executing prisoners of war especially during 1956 and 1967 Israeli - Egyptian wars .
This was reported in the Israeli Haaretz newspaper in June 27th 2000 .
The Egyptian Human Rights Organization Secretary - General , Muhammad Munib , submitted a report confirming that Israel had killed between 7,000 to 15,000 Egyptian prisoners of wars of 1956 and 1967 .
The report also identified the locations of 11 mass graves in Sinai and Israel in which thousands of Egyptian prisoners were buried .
The most prominent of these massacres was the El - Arish massacre , where Israeli forces murdered at least 150 Egyptian prisoners of war .
Some of the prisoners were run over by Israeli tanks several times , a crime that is still practiced by Israeli army especially in the Gaza Strip .
The story of the massacre was originally reported by Israeli eyewitnesses in Israel ’s Yediot Ahronot newspaper , and later by Israeli journalist Ran Adelist on Israeli television .
It was also reported by the Washington Report of May / June 1996 pages 27 and 28 .
The massacre was also recorded by the American USS Liberty surveillance ship that was sailing 12 miles off the shore of Gaza .
This massacre was a serious war crime and could have been the main reason for the Israeli attack on the Liberty .
Worse than the Nazis the Israeli army had adopted the policy of targeting young Palestinian children in an attempt to “ nudge ” Palestinian families to leave the country for the sake of the future of the children , and / or to exhaust their financial resources in treating and caring for their disabled and crippled wounded children ; the victims of Israeli snipers .
Since the beginning of the second Palestinian Intifada , September 2000 , Israeli forces have murdered 1050 children in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank ; see also the Guardian , October 21 , 2008 , and Al - Jazeera , October 22 , 2008 .
A Palestinian Centre for Human Rights report documented , with eyewitness testimonies , at least 68 children were murdered by Israeli army during 12 months from June 07 to June 07 just before the cease fire agreement .
The child murder toll rose dramatically during the first six months of 2008 with the Israeli army massive assault of “ Operation Winter Heat ” against Gaza Strip .
Children were directly targeted by Israeli snipers while walking in the streets , while standing in front of their homes , and even while sitting in their school rooms , also directly by drone missiles while playing in courts .
They are also the indirect victims if Israeli deliberate targeting densely populated residential areas ( Gaza is densely populated ) including schools , hospitals and food markets .
The average age of the targeted children was ten years old according to a thousand - page document by Save the Children .
The majority of these children were innocent bystanders not participating in any “ hostile ” activity or causing any threat to the heavily armed Israeli soldiers .
In the 80 % of the cases of targeted children , the Israeli army prevented the victim from receiving any medical attention .
The report also documented that more than 50,000 child victims required medical attention for injuries including gunshot wounds , tear gas inhalation and multiple fractures .
A bulletin titled “ Deliberate Murder ” published in 1989 by the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights reported the targeting of Palestinian children by Israeli army and snipers from “ special unit ” had “ carefully chosen ” the children , who were shot in the head or heart and died instantaneously ( Mike Berry & Greg Philo , ‘ Israel and Palestine - Competing Histories ’ , Pluto Press , London , 2006 , pp. 86-87 ) .
According to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention , and the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ( signed by Israel ) children are to be afforded special protection during international armed conflicts .
Israel had , and still is violating these international laws .
Like Nazi Germany , who developed and used all kinds of new weapons including the V2 rocket bomb and nerve gas , Israel has used every kind of weapons , even new experimental ones , against Palestinian civilians .
This included the Dumdum exploding bullets , nerve gas , experimental chemical and biological weapons , flying drones , and DIME ( Dense Inert Metal Explosive ) and the latest remote control high power machine guns ( seer shoots ) installed on the high towers of the imprisoning wall ( separation wall ) and operated by teen aged female soldiers in far away operating rooms like computerized war games .
Israel is also know to be a nuclear weapon and is always hinting at using it if / when they feel threatened .
Nazi Germans were brainwashed and driven by a social supremacist ideology of the superior Aryan Race ( Der Supermann ) .
They believed that they were superior to the rest of the people and that they should rule the world .
Similarly the Israelis are brainwashed and driven by the religious supremacist ideology of god ’s chosen people in god ’s promised land , and believe that it is their religious duty ( mitzvah ) to cleanse the world from all gentiles ( non - Jews ) , and to establish a Jewish only world government in preparation for the coming of the Messiah .
Such dangerous extreme ideology is taught to Israeli children since childhood .
Moshe Feiglin , who won a respectable position on the Likuds ’ Knesset list for the upcoming Israeli election is an admirer of Hitler and his superior ideology .
In an interview with the Ha’aretz Newspaper in 1995 he described Hitler as a military genius and a great nation builder .
“ Hitler was an unparallel military genius .
Nazism had transformed Germany from a low to a fantastic physical and ideological status .
The ragged , trashy youth body turned into a neat and orderly part of society and Germany received an exemplary regime , a proper justice system , and public order . …
This was no bunch of thugs .
They merely used thugs and homosexuals ” .
His holocaustal solution to the Palestinian problem , according to his Manhigut ha’Yehudit ( Jewish leadership ) website , is to order “ the complete stoppage of water , electricity and communication ” to the four million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza .
Feiglin expresses the inner sentiment of every Israeli political leader starting from their first Prime Minister Ben Gurion up to Tzipi Livni , the latest acting Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affair , who have been calling for the murder and the transfer of Palestinians out of the god ’s promised land of Israel ( Erez Israel ) .
Their real policies become obvious and louder in their campaign rhetoric .
Such genocidal holocaustal tendencies are nurtured , encouraged and called for by top Israeli Rabbis and political leaders .
Rabbi Yousef Obadia , the top Israeli religious leader , Rabbi Yisrael Rosen , director of the Tsomet Institute , Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu , the leading religious authority in Israel ’s religious national current and former chief Eastern rabbi for Israel , Rabbi Dov Lior , president of the Council of Rabbis of Judea and Samaria ( the West Bank ) , Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu , the chief rabbi of Safed and a candidate for the post of chief rabbi or Israel , Rabbi Eliyahu Kinvinsky , the second most senior authority in the Orthodox religious current , Rabbi Israel Ariel , one of the most prominent rabbis in the West Bank colonies , and Rabbi Yitzhaq Ginsburg , a top rabbi in Israel among many other extremist religious Israeli leaders are continually calling for total extermination and transfer of Palestinians .
Brainwashed and misguided Israelis , especially religious fundamentalists , regularly attack Palestinian towns , vandalize their churches , mosques and cemeteries with graffiti slogans such as “ Death to Arabs ” , “ Gas the Arabs ” , and “ Mohammad is a pig ” , occupying Palestinian after forcefully evicting their Palestinian owners , attacking farmers , burning their crops , cutting their fruit trees , poisoning their water wells , killing their farm animals , destroying properties , looting shops , terrorizing civilians and children and shooting people .
Searching youtube.com for “ Israeli settlers violence ” to watch the hundreds of videos showing Israeli settlers terrorism .
One prominent similarity between Israel and the Nazis is their state sponsored terror groups .
According to articles “ Eichmann Tells His Own Damning Story ” , Life Magazine , Volume 49 , Number 22 , ( November 28th 1960 ) pp. 19-25 , 101-112 , and “ Eichmann ’s Own Story : Part II ” , Life Magazine , December 6th 1960 pp. 146-161 , Adolf Eichmann stated how Zionist leaders were idealist like Nazi leaders , willing to sacrifice hundred thousands of their own blood to achieve political goal .
Lenni Brenner explains in his book “ Zionism in the Age of Dictators ” , in chapter 25 , that Eichmann was referring here to a deal the Nazi struck with Zionist leaders , such as Hungarian Rezso Kastner , to save a few thousand hand - picked Zionists and wealthy Jews , who would immigrate to Palestine , in return for leading 750,000 Hungarian Jews , and other millions of European Jews to their death to make Jews “ rightful victim ” , so that World Zionist Organization would have the “ right ” to come “ before the bargaining table when they divide nations and lands at the war ’s end … for only with ( Jewish ) blood shall we ( Zionists ) get the land . ”
The Nazis set up Police Battalion 101 , a terrorist group , whose sole purpose was hunting Jewish citizens , killing them and looting and destroying their property .
Daniel Jonah Goldhagen states in his book “ Hitler ’s Willing Executioners ” that Battalion 101 was responsible for “ the deportation and gruesome slaughter in Poland of tens of thousands of Jewish men , women , and children ” .
Israel had its own exact copy of Battalion 101 called Unit 101 under the terrorist Ariel Sharon , who later became Israel ’s Prime Minister .
Under Sharon ’s leadership Unit 101 adopted the same criminal methods to terrorize Palestinians .
It also implemented what became known as jeep raids ; driving jeeps , with machine guns mounted on the front and rear , into Palestinian towns murdering inhabitants , dynamiting homes , and burning their fields .
Since early 1950s Unit 101 was responsible for massacres in Palestinian towns such as Bureij refugee camp , Qibya , Idna , Surif , Wadi Fukin , Falameh , Rantis , Jerusalem , Budrus , Dawayima , Beit Liqya , Khan Younis and Gaza .
Israel had always resorted to terrorist attacks against Jews in other countries especially Arab countries , such as North African Arab countries , Iraq , Lebanon , and Jordan , to encourage Jewish Arab residents to immigrate to Israel .
The Lavon Affair is just one famous terrorist related incident in Egypt .
In January 29th 1999 article in Israeli Ha’aretz paper , Gideon Spiro , a former member of the 890 battalion , stated that Unit 101 was an early , more primitive prototype for the more sophisticated liquidation units of Duvdevan and Shimshon established during the Intifada ”
Its operations were characterized by “ lots of killing of civilians and little real combat ” .
Israel is the only county in the world with many Prime Ministers , who were members of terrorist and state - sponsored terrorist organizations directly involved in slaughter of civilians .
These include Golda Meir , Yitzhak Rabin , Menachem Begin , Yitzhak Shamir , Ehud Barak , Ariel Sharon , and Shimon Peres .
Arnold Toynbee wrote “ It was a supreme tragedy that the lesson learnt by them ( the Jews ) from their encounter with the Nazi German Gentiles should have been , not to eschew but to imitate some of the evil deeds that the Nazis had committed against the Jews . ”
Israelis and Jews of the world have relentlessly pursued Nazi war criminals for decades for their war crimes committed during WWII .
They chased Nazi war criminals for the rest of their lives , even when they were old and close to their death , to make them pay for their crimes .
No doubts in my mind that Israeli war criminals , in turn , will be pursued and sentenced for their war crimes committed against Arabs .
Busting wide open two common stereotypes , a pro-gay bill was introduced by a Republican legislator in Virginia ’s lower house that would allow Virginia companies to provide life insurance to partners of gay employees .
Virginia law currently restricts supplemental life insurance coverage to legal spouses and dependent children under 19 or 25 if the child is a full - time student .
The new bill , filed by Delegate Tom Rust ( R - Fairfax ) , would open that up to allow coverage to anyone “ mutually … agreed upon by the insurer and the group policyholder . ”
Please contact and thank Mr. Tom Rust for being proactive and supporting gay employees .

Hurricane
Ike damaged almost half the homes in Harris County and left more than 18,000 dwellings uninhabitable , according to a detailed assessment by the Harris County Housing Authority .
Hardest hit was the small Galveston Bay community of Shoreacres , an all - residential town where 58.6 percent of the homes were destroyed or suffered greater than 50 percent damage , according to the assessment provided to the Houston Chronicle Tuesday .
The report , based on inspections of 774,000 of the county ’s 994,000 residential units from Sept. 23 through Nov. 13 , is the most comprehensive assessment to date of the destruction caused by Ike , although it ’s limited to residential damage in Harris County .
Harris County officials asked the housing authority to conduct the assessment in part because no standardized method existed for communities to assess disaster impacts , said Guy Rankin , the authority ’s chief executive .
He said he hopes the techniques developed for this study will be adopted throughout the country .
A team of 200 inspectors fanned out across the county and observed damage to houses , apartments and mobile homes .
Homes determined to have major damage — 51 percent or more of their value — were considered uninhabitable .
The study concluded that 48 percent of the county ’s dwelling units sustained minor damage — 50 percent of value or less .
Less than 1 percent sustained major damage .
The authority can conduct the same study for Galveston , Jefferson or other counties affected by Ike if asked to do so , Rankin said .
The county is paying the study ’s $ 3.5 million cost and will seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency , he said .
The data also will help local officials plan for housing needs in Ike ’s aftermath , Rankin said .
He ’s particularly concerned about the potential for thousands of houses with damaged roofs to deteriorate if owners do n’t repair them promptly .
The findings did n’t surprise Nancy Schnell , whose family has been living in a travel trailer parked on its property in Shoreacres while contractors gutted the family house for rebuilding .
As she spoke Tuesday , Schnell watched children step off a school bus and walk down a street piled high with debris from gutted houses .
“ It ’s horrific , ” Schnell said of the conditions in Shoreacres , where she said the first FEMA mobile homes did n’t arrive until three months after Ike ’s Sept. 13 landfall .
The value of Shoreacres homes left uninhabitable by Ike totaled $ 27 million , the report states .
The assessment identified $ 8.2 billion in residential property damage in Harris County , down slightly from the $ 8.5 billion preliminary estimate released by the housing authority in October .
Generally , small cities and unincorporated areas sustained major damage to more of their homes than Houston did , although the monetary value of damaged property in Houston was higher , at $ 4.6 billion , because of generally higher property values in the city .
El Lago , a southeast Harris County town of about 4,100 people , was a distant second to Shoreacres in major damage , with 12.6 percent of its homes destroyed or sustaining greater than 50 percent damage .
Next were Seabrook , 11.4 percent , and Nassau Bay , 10.1 percent .
The report includes the Harris County Flood Control District ’s assessment of flooding caused by Ike ’s storm surge and rainfall .
The storm surge reached 10 to 12 feet in southeast Harris County from Morgan ’s Point to Kemah , the district reported .
The combined effects of the surge and wave action of 4 to 6 feet accounted for the devastation in Shoreacres , the flood control district said .
A similar effect occurred in the Galveston County communities of San Leon and Bacliff .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 15 ( UPI ) -- Vice President Dick Cheney denied the United States uses torture but said interrogation practices used on terror suspects have been " remarkably successful . "
In an interview with ABC News , Cheney said waterboarding was appropriate in the interrogation of Khalid Sheik Mohammed , accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .

" On the question of so - called torture , we do n't do torture , " Cheney said .
" We never have .
It 's not something that this administration subscribes to . "
He said he supported the interrogation techniques used on Mohammed .
" There was a period of time there , three or four years ago , when about half of everything we knew about al - Qaida came from that one source , " he added .
" So , it 's been a remarkably successful effort .
I think the results speak for themselves . "
In an interview Monday with right - wing radio personality Rush Limbaugh , Cheney said he does n't think the incoming Obama administration will give up the power he helped accrue to the executive branch .
" We did not exceed our constitutional authority , as some have suggested , but we -- the president believes , I believe very deeply , in a strong executive , and I think that 's essential in this day and age , " Cheney said .
" And I think the Obama administration is not likely to cede that authority back to the Congress .
I think they 'll find that given a challenge they face , they 'll need all the authority they can muster . "
Cheney said he is most proud of the administration 's work to prevent further terrorist attacks on U.S. soil after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , and thinks the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where terror suspects are detained " has been very well run " and will be hard to close .
On the economy , Cheney said he thinks the steps taken so far to help the financial markets are " taking us in the right direction . "
" But obviously there 's still -- still a lot of work to be done out there , and we 're still faced with the aftermath of a lot of this for the next several months , " he said .
" It 's a problem the Obama administration is going to have to deal with . "
The eternal problem of keeping teeth away from penises has been solved by a dentist ( naturally ) .
It 's called the BlowGuard .

How does it work ?
It 's essentially a mouth guard — you know , like the ones boxers use — that you use while performing oral sex .
On a male .
It retails for $ 28 and contains a pack of strawberry flavored lubrication .
Not sure whether or not the lube goes on the inside as well as the outside of the Blowguard , but you can use it how you like .
It 's a seriously good idea , as any guy who 's been accidentally teethed can attest to .
Not sure how it feels on the giver .
Probably not that much worse than having a penis in the mouth .

Onderzoekers van het Institute for Logic , Language and Computation ( ILLC ) van de UvA weerleggen de theorie van Chomsky over taalverwerving door kinderen .
In hun prijswinnende onderzoek laten ze zien dat kinderen een taal niet leren aan de hand van een aangeboren grammatica , maar dat de grammaticale eenheden waaruit kinderen zinnen samenstellen stapsgewijs abstracter worden naarmate kinderen groter worden .
In hun paper Children ’s grammars grow more abstract with age - Evidence from an automatic procedure for identifying the productive units of language schrijven onderzoekers Gideon Borensztajn , Jelle Zuidema en Rens Bod dat kinderen taal leren aan de hand van generalisaties over concrete taalwaarnemingen .
Chomsky ’s hypothese
Hoe kinderen hun moedertaal leren , is een onderwerp dat taalwetenschappers blijft bezighouden .
Grofweg gezegd baseren de theorieën hierover zich op twee tegenovergestelde uitgangspunten .
Aanhangers van Noam Chomsky ’s generatieve grammatica gaan ervan uit dat kinderen de essentie van de grammatica van hun moedertaal bij hun geboorte meekrijgen , compleet met abstracte regels en grammaticale categorieën .
Volgens Chomsky ’s continuïteitshypothese zijn grammaticale regels en categorieën onveranderlijk , en werkt een mens vanaf zijn eerste woordjes tot het eind van zijn leven in principe met dezelfde grammaticale eenheden .
Na de geboorte
Aanhangers van Chomsky worden tegengesproken door wetenschappers die trachten te onderbouwen dat kinderen al hun kennis over taal na de geboorte verwerven op basis van hun omgeving .
Deze aanhangers van de constuctiegrammatica en datageoriënteerde taalkunde stellen dat taalregels bestaan uit een dynamische verzameling van constructies van diverse afmetingen en maten van abstractie .
Zij hebben gevonden dat er een geleidelijke overgang plaatsvindt van heel concrete constructies naar abstractere constructies met open ‘ posities ’ , die steeds meer gaan lijken op volwassen grammaticale regels .
Tot op heden was er slechts fragmentarische ondersteuning voor de laatste visie , gebaseerd op maar een handvol voorbeelden .
Het onderzoek van de Uva- onderzoekers ondersteunt met behulp van zelfontwikkelde modellen en op basis van een grootschalige analyse de hypothese dat de abstractie van de kindergrammatica toeneemt .
Prijs
De onderzoekers ontvingen voor hun onderzoek de internationale Cognitive Science 2008 best paper award in Applied Cognitive Modeling .
De prijs , die bestaat uit een award en een geldbedrag , wordt in juli uitgereikt op het jaarlijkse internationale congres voor de cognitiewetenschappen ( CogSci 2008 ) in Washington D.C .
( CNN ) -- Cristiano Ronaldo gave Manchester United a New Year boost by again ruling out a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid .
Ronaldo's goals fired United 's brilliant 2008 - 09 campaign .
The European Footballer of the Year has been constantly linked with a transfer to the Bernabeu , speculation which increased following recent claims that Real had reached an agreement with United over his eventual sale .
" There 's always speculation , not just about me , but about the future of players all around the world , " Ronaldo told the club 's official television station MUTV .
" People were speaking about me this summer but that was normal because of what I did during the season .
" What people are saying now is not true .
Who says that is a liar because I am happy at the club , I want to stay here .
I feel at home here .
I feel very happy here . "
Ronaldo was widely quoted during a turbulent summer that he was keen to play for Real and it appeared only a matter of time before the move became a reality , but now the 23 - year - old is pledging loyalty to the Old Trafford faithful .
" I love the fans because they have been brilliant with me , not just this season but every season .
Like I said before , I feel at home in Manchester , " he added .
Football Fanzone Football fans , the chance to have YOUR say on CNN is here !

Ronaldo scored 42 goals in United 's Premier League and Champions League double last season and after coming back from ankle surgery has netted 11 times this campaign .
United go into 2009 handily - placed to retain the English title , in the knockout stages of the Champions League and semifinals of the League Cup .
Ronaldo is crucial to their continued success and he used the interview to pay tribute to the role manager Alex Ferguson has played in his development into a world class player .
' I want to be part of this club with you .
I want to win trophies with you . '
He 's very important in my career , Alex Ferguson , " he added .
FOR centuries , grist - grinders and sailors have exploited the wind .
Now , New York developers , homeowners and city leaders might be coming around .
A handful of buildings are already drawing electricity from wind turbines , which typically resemble table fans , or mounted airplane propellers .
Unlike some of the skyscraping versions that dot rural hillsides , small turbines supply power directly to homes without first sending it through a utility company ’s lines .
One major sticking point in the city is that densely packed buildings tend to scatter breezes , making it tough to capture steady gusts .
Although this and other kinks need to be addressed before the widespread rollout of small turbines is possible , there are signs of gains .
What compares with the Coming of Barack Obama ?
March 1933 perhaps , when an America brought low by the worst slump of the modern era entered a New Year in the hope that the incoming president , a Democrat with an infectious optimism and an interventionist philosophy , could lift it out of the Great Depression .
Or maybe 1945 , when the same Franklin Roosevelt was about to be sworn into office for a fourth time .
By then FDR of course was physically exhausted , gaunt and hollow , with scant trace of the jauntiness of old .
But even though he would not live to see it , victory was in the air .
After five years of bloodshed , America and the world hoped that before the year was out , the most destructive conflict in human history might at last be over .
And then there was 1961 , when an elegant and handsome young president – hatless and clad only in a light morning coat even though eight inches of fresh snow lay on the ground in Washington DC – proclaimed that the torch of leadership was passing to a new generation of Americans , a generation forged in war but not too old to dream .

Had he lived , John Kennedy would be 91 today .
Instead , he is frozen in that moment of dazzling , seemingly boundless promise .
Not yet 44 , he was the youngest man ever to become president , having promised his fellow citizens not just change but national renewal .
Some of course believed he was too young .
Others muttered darkly that he had stolen the election .
Nonetheless , a country felt proud and exhilarated by what it had brought about .
But even JFK did not unleash the hope inspired by Obama in these dark times .
Ever since Roosevelt 's day , once the US had emerged as the richest and most militarily powerful nation on earth and had sealed the century as its own , an American president has always been the property not just of his own country , but to a certain extent of the whole world .
But never , surely , quite like now .
Washington itself may be swamped by up to five million visitors for the festivities that reach their climax when Obama is sworn in on the western steps of the US Capitol building at noon on Tuesday 20 January .
But they will be the merest fraction of a global audience that will run into billions .
And this audience is not simply drawn by the prospect of a spectacle to match the marriage of Charles and Diana , or the opening ceremony of the Olympics .
This vast cross-section of humanity is yearning for a miracle .
Neither Kennedy , nor even FDR , was burdened with quite the weight of expectation that presses on this president - elect .
Recession , global warming , the travails of the Middle East , terrorism and great civilisational clashes – these crises and others , it is so tempting to believe , can be solved in the Age of Obama .
Never , to paraphrase Winston Churchill , have so many invested so much hope in a single individual .
Except that the object of their fixation is not a proven titan like Churchill .
Barack Obama 's career on the national political stage began barely four years ago .
He has run nothing of note , except an admittedly brilliantly conducted campaign for the White House .
Now he must run everything .
He will be ultimately responsible for a federal budget of three trillion dollars .
He will lead the mightiest military on earth .
Most important of all , he will be in charge of his country 's government , at a moment when Americans look more intensely to government for solutions than at any time since the Great Depression .
This huge outpouring of hope moreover ignores a paradox .
In 1945 , the US stood at the pinnacle of its power .
The Red Army might have been about to conquer Berlin , but America was far and away the wealthiest country on earth .
It could create , and to all intents and purposes impose , a new global financial system .
Singlehanded , it could promote international economic recovery , as it did with the Marshall Plan in a Western Europe that might otherwise have fallen under Communist control .

Six decades later , the biggest creditor nation on earth has turned into the world 's biggest debtor .
In a globalised age , the US is one economic power centre among several .
The slump of 2008 may have started there , but the key to ending it is to be found in Beijing , Delhi and Brussels as well .
Yet for now these inconvenient truths are forgotten in the euphoria over Obama .
Can he do it ?
The deafening chant echoes back : Yes He Can .
This huge investment of hope is testament to America 's enduring appeal .
That the world looks to one country , to one man , for an answer proves that however much his country 's reputation has been tarnished by George W Bush , the US remains the world 's supplier of last resort of hope , the belief against the odds that the human condition can be improved .
America 's struggles , excesses , failures and triumphs are those of all of us .
By all these measures , the advent of Obama is an especially stirring moment .
After eight years , each one of which felt longer than the one before , George W Bush , at home and abroad the most unpopular US leader of the modern era , will be gone .
Once again , a generational torch is being passed on .
The soon - to - be 44th president may be only 15 years younger than his predecessor , compared to the 27 - year difference between Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower in 1961 , but to all intents and purposes he comes from a different generation .
Obama was born that same year , and technically he could be placed in the rearguard of the baby - boom cohort to which Bill Clinton and George W Bush belong .
But his formative years were the late Seventies and Eighties , not the self - indulgent Sixties .
Moreover , by dint of his parentage , and his upbringing in Hawaii and Indonesia , he has been able to look upon America from the outside as well as from the inside .
That , too , helps explain the unmatched anticipation abroad .
Finally , the rest of us believe , the US will have a leader who understands not just how his country sees itself – but how it is seen by the 95 per cent of human beings who are not American .
Obama 's victory however means even more than that .
If you believe in the perfectibility of America , this is your moment .
If slavery was the country 's original sin , the election of the first black president has expunged that sin , at least in part .
The start of his journey to the White House was unforgettable enough .
He announced his candidacy on a morning in February 2007 even more frigid than the day JFK was inaugurated , on the steps of the old State House in Springfield , Illinois , where Abraham Lincoln , arguably America 's greatest president , started his own political journey .
Almost a century and a half after Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation that freed black slaves in the midst of America 's Civil War , an African - American , whose political journey had begun in the same state legislature , was declaring his ambition to follow Lincoln 's steps to the summit of the political mountain .
Not only that , too , he had a real chance of winning .
And he did .
Thus the end of the journey will be even more memorable and extraordinary than its beginning .
Fittingly , the inauguration takes place just 24 hours after the annual US federal holiday in honour of Martin Luther King , leader and martyr of the civil rights movement , a man venerated in every nation and who did so much to make Obama 's achievement possible .
In August 1963 , three months before Kennedy was cut down in Dallas , King told hundreds of thousands of people gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington of his dream , of how black and white Americans one day would live side by side in harmony and equality .
Just 17 days from now , not thousands but millions of people will gather at the other end of the Mall to hear Obama 's inaugural address .
Could there be a better moment to dream ?
Has this sour , jaded and pessimistic planet ever needed a pick - me - up more ?
Dreams by their nature defy everyday logic .
Surely 2009 cannot be worse than 2008 – except of course it can .
Economic forecasts are uniformly dreadful .
The US car industry remains on the brink of collapse .
The interlocking crises of the Middle East , Iran , Pakistan and Afghanistan look , if anything , more intractable than they did 12 months ago .
Quite possibly , the heroic efforts of Obama notwithstanding , we will be feeling even more gloomy in December 2009 than we do now – and next year of course , there will be no Obama inauguration to savour .
But at this dawn of 2009 he embodies the magic of America , its endless ability to reinvent itself .
F Scott Fitzgerald famously declared there are no second acts in American lives .
But in the life of the country itself , the do - overs are countless – and we are about to witness one for the ages .
The Bush era of wilful ignorance , anti-intellectualism and zealotry is out .
The English language is back .
So is nuance , pragmatism , and a respect for non-partisan expertise .
What other country but the US could elect a man whose middle name , Hussein , is the same as that of the dictator against whom the country went to war in 2003 ?
Obscure colonels may grab power in less fortunate parts of the world .
But in what other democratic country could such an outsider have come from nowhere to claim the supreme prize ?
Barack Obama is but the latest proof that in America , everything is possible .
And that is why the rest of us are so excited , even though we know that only in America do such things happen .

This comes , what , 48 hours after the Vatican lectured Obama about ethics and arrogance ?
For a pope who was himself a member of the Hitler Youth , this will only feed concerns that perhaps this particular Prada - wearing German is a bit too close to his own Nazi past .
Benedict yesterday welcomed back into the Roman Catholic Church Richard Williamson and three other men who were excommunicated in 1988 after being ordained without Vatican permission .
The three had been appointed by breakaway French archbishop Marcel Lefebvre .
The Vatican decree issued yesterday spoke of overcoming the “ scandal of divisiveness ” and seeking reconciliation with Lefebvre ’s conservative order , the Society of Saint Pius X , which opposes the modernisation of Catholic doctrine .
But Jewish groups have warned the Pope that the decision could damage Catholic - Jewish relations after Williamson claimed in an interview , broadcast last week , that historical evidence “ is hugely against six million having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler … I believe there were no gas chambers ” ….
In an interview taped last November and aired last Wednesday on Swedish television , Williamson said he agreed with the “ most serious ” revisionist historians of the second world war who had concluded that “ between 200,000 - 300,000 perished in Nazi concentration camps , but not one of them by gassing in a gas chamber ” .

We ’re now one month into the new year .
When it comes to computing , this year ’s CES was largely uneventful and uninspiring .
We feel that , in spite of its slow start , the coming year can be a big year for the evolution of the personal computer .
In the last few months , subtle changes have been happening that when paired together make for an exciting moment in the world of computing .
Just how good can this year be for the PC ?
Here ’s our list of the 10 big developments that could go from early adoption to market domination in the year ahead .
I , for one , welcome our new 4G , SSD , dual - screen , 3D touch - screen overlords …
Number Ten : Dual Screens for Laptops
Lenovo ’s introduction of the ThinkPad W700 is hopefully the beginning of a trend .
Its secondary screen is great for artists , CAD designers or anyone else who just ca n’t get enough desktop real estate .
See also : Voodoo ’s Firefly concept , whose 4.3 - inch screen is great for checking e-mail while waiting to respawn in Counter - Strike .
Number Nine : 3G to 4G
As the third generation of wireless communications becomes ubiquitous this year , it ’s time to think about moving on .
In Baltimore , where Sprint is rolling out a 3G / 4G modem for mobile broadband , average download rates range from 2 Mbps to 4 Mbps , compared to 3G speeds of 600 Kbps to 1.4 Mbps .
Hopefully we ’ll see more cell phone companies offer similar dual solutions while the next generation takes over .
Number Eight : Designer Netbooks
We thought we ’d seen everything with the crystal - studded Nintendo DS , but then HP introduced the “ China Chic ” HP Mini 100 , a sultry red number designed by Vivienne Tam .
And why not ?
These little laptops fit into pocketbooks anyway .
Look for more designers to cash in as the netbook becomes a fad .
Number Seven : USB 3.0
The new “ SuperSpeed ” USB technology wo n’t hit until 2010 , but its effects should be felt early in the form of Firewire ’s ultimate demise .
The latest MacBooks have already taken the bold step of removing Firewire in favor of USB 2.0 , perhaps an indication that other computer makers will follow .
If that ’s what must be done to make room for 5 Gbps of data transfer , so be it .
Number Six : Touch Screens
As touchable displays take over cell phones , the door is open for greater interest in tablet PCs as well .
Asus introduced the T91 at CES this year .
HP and Fujitsu released touch screen laptops towards the end of last year .
With Windows 7 offering more touch screen features than ever , this could finally be the tablet ’s time to go mainstream .
Number Five : Cloud Computing
It ’s hard to pin down how Cloud computing will change in 2009 — especially because its core principal says you ca n’t tell what ’s going on behind the scenes — but there ’s at least a proliferation of online apps like Google ’s ever - expanding suite , and the corporate world is apparently keen on the idea as well .
Look for more news on this during the International Cloud Computing Conference and Expo in late March .
Number Four : 3D Visual Interfaces
An Apple patent for a three - dimensional desktop was revealed in December , but BumpTop and Project Looking Glass have similar ideas in the works .
With new advances in 3D imaging this year , perhaps a true virtual office space is in reach at last .
Number Three : Smaller , Slimmer All - in- Ones
All - in- One PCs positively blew up at CES this year , with Dell , Sony , Gateway and Lenovo all vying to be America ’s next top model .
Really , they ’re all coming out winners for having so many options to choose from .
Our favorite , though , did n’t come from any of these PC - making heavyweights .
We liked Shuttle ’s X50 because it comes with a handle .
Number Two : Intel Core i7
With Alienware , Dell and Gateway getting in on Intel ’s latest processor , it ’s clear this is the must - have for PC gamers .
Gizmodo does an admirable job of explaining the nitty gritty of the i7 ’s might , but the processor reduces bottlenecks , enables the use of more RAM and divides up tasks more efficiently — just what you need when getting your frag on .
Number One : Solid State Drives
Later this year , Asus and Toshiba will both offer laptops with solid state drives .
These read faster , are more reliable and use less power than hard disc drives , so it ’s obviously something that should be implemented in more portable PCs over time .
Solid state ’s higher cost will prevent it from becoming the majority by year - end , but this is only their first year of availability .
Once it ’s accessible for all , HDD will be officially on notice .
Thanks for reading , GearCravers , Stumblers , Redditers and otherwise .

[ Haskell ] Jane Street Summer Project 2009
I 'm pleased to announce the Jane Street Summer Project for 2009 .
The goal of the JSSP is to make functional programming languages into better practical tools for programming in the real world .
To do that , we will fund students over the summer to work on open - source projects which aim at improving the practical utility of their favorite functional language .
The JSSP is a follow - on to last year 's OCaml Summer Project .
A key difference this year is that we are opening up the project to proposals in languages other than OCaml ( although we expect to maintain a focus on OCaml projects . )
There are also some changes to the funding structure that are particularly relevant for projects located in the US .
If you want to find out more , you can look at the JSSP blog : http://janestreetsummer.com
And at the project FAQ : http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/57
We 're looking forward to a great and productive summer , and we hope some of you come along for the ride !
Thanks , Yaron Minsky
Linux has had this neat feature for quite some time now : since 2.4.19 according to the docs .
Yet , it is neither very known nor very used .
I could n’t even find a program that would create a new namespace for its subprocesses , similar to what chroot does with the root of the file hierarchy .
This neat feature allows each process to have a different set of mount points .
While you most of the time want processes to share their mount points , there are some cases where you may want to have some processes have a different set of mount points .
Combined with bind mounts , it can allow some useful setups .
In case you are not familiar with bind mounts , they allow to “ attach ” a part of the file hierarchy to some place else .
For example :
$ ls / mnt $ ls /usr bin games include lib lib32 lib64 local sbin share src X11R6 $ mount -- bind / usr / mnt $ ls / mnt bin games include lib lib32 lib64 local sbin share src X11R6
Now , take pam - tmpdir , for example .
It sets $ TMPDIR and $ TMP to point to a user - specific temporary directory .
Sadly , it is pretty useless for applications that do n’t follow the standards of using these environment variables .
Without namespaces , if you ’d create a temporary directory and bind - mount it to / tmp , this new / tmp would be visible to everyone , to every process .
But with namespaces , you can make this new / tmp only available to subprocesses .
If pam - tmpdir were to do this , it would also allow applications trying to write to /tmp without resorting to $ TMP or $ TMPDIR to be using the temporary space , without impacting external processes , that would still be using the original / tmp .
On x86 - 64 , you can run both 64 - bits and 32 - bits applications .
64 - bits applications would take libraries from / usr / lib , and 32 - bits applications would search libraries in /usr / lib32 .
But badly crafted 32 - bits applications could be trying to load libraries from / usr / lib , where only 64 - bits versions are available .
With namespaces , the broken 32 - bits application could have / usr / lib32 bind - mounted to /usr / lib without the 64 - bits applications knowing .
You could certainly get a similar result with the following set of commands :
$ mount -- rbind / / chroot $ mount -- rbind / usr / lib32 / chroot / usr / lib $ chroot / chroot $ application
( –rbind also attaches submounts , contrary to –bind )
The downside , here , is that external processes will see all this setup under / chroot .
The whole setup would be invisible to external processes if namespaces were used .
Another nice use of namespaces would be to mount encrypted volumes under a different namespace , so that only a limited set of processes would be allowed to read the decrypted data .
The sad thing is that you need the admin capability to create a new namespace , so that would need to be done by a setuid root program .
There are , as far as a few hours fiddling showed me , 2 system calls that will setup a new namespace : clone ( 2 ) , and unshare ( 2 ) .
The second is easier to use , though only available since 2.6.16 .
But while etch ships 2.6.18 , the glibc coming with it does n’t implement unshare ( 2 ) , so we need to use syscall ( 2 ) instead .
The following code will run / bin /sh , or any command given as argument after creating a new namespace .
The new process and its subprocesses will inherit the new namespace .
#include < sched.h > # include < syscall.h > # include < unistd.h > int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { syscall ( SYS_unshare , CLONE_NEWNS ) ; if ( argc > 1 ) return execvp ( argv [ 1 ] , &argv [ 1 ] ) ; return execv( " / bin/sh " , NULL ) ; }
This tool , once built , is called newns in the following example .
$ mkdir / tmp/abc $ ./ newns $ mount -n -- bind / tmp / abc / tmp $ touch / tmp / a $ ls /tmp a < in another terminal > $ ls /tmp abc $ ls /tmp/ abc a
When using namespaces , it is better not to have mount fill / etc / mtab , using the -n argument .
/ proc / mounts will contain the proper mount information about the namespace of the process reading it .
/ proc / PID / mounts will contain the mount information for the given process .
As bind mounts also work on files , you can override some files .
The following will run dash instead of bash ( in subprocesses , too , obviously ) :
$ ./newns sh -c " mount -n -- bind /bin/dash /bin/bash ; /bin/bash "
Back to the idea of having encrypted volumes only available to some processes , the following should work ( unverified ) :
$ ./newns sh -c " encfs /tmp/crypt-raw /tmp/crypt ; /bin/bash "
Only the opened bash , and its subprocesses , would have access to / tmp / crypt .
The newns tool used above could , to allow normal users to be able to fiddle with namespaces , be improved to be a setuid root program that would drop its privileges right after unshare ( 2 ) to take the same privileges as the calling process .
As you can see , per-process namespaces have a wide range of possible uses ; it ’s astonishing that it ’s not more used yet , considering its age .
Additionally to per-process namespaces , there are also a bunch of other ( more recent ) features that allow to implement vserver - like features with a vanilla kernel , such as networking netspaces ( work under progress , though ) , PID namespaces and utsname ( see uname ( 2 ) ) namespaces .
Actually , these features are designed to be used by vserver and openvz .
I am looking forward to having unprivileged mounts implemented , so that users could fool around with bind mounts .
Unprivileged namespaces would be a nice addition .

The BSD # Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework and applications to the FreeBSD operating system .
Because of a lack of time , Mono stalled at version 1.2.5 for more than one year in the FreeBSD ports tree .
However , things have moved and the BSD #
Team is proud to announce that the Mono ports are about to be updated to 2.0.1 .
Ports depending on Mono will also be updated to the latest available version at the same occasion .
While the ports will be updated really soon now that FreeBSD 7.1 has been released , impatient people can download and merge the BSD # ports in their FreeBSD tree right now following the instructions provided on the BSD # Project 's page .
Open tasks :
Test and send feedback .
Port Mono applications to FreeBSD .
Build a debug live - image of FreeBSD so that Mono hackers without a FreeBSD box can help us fixing bugs more efficiency .

Last year , we did n't have many Bugathons - this year is planned to be different !
The BugBusting team is trying to improve bug handling and thus we 'll start a new experiment .
In the past our Bugathons were general Bugathons with no special topic set .
Instead , starting in 2009 we 'll try to hold a series of Bugathons that concentrate on special interest areas .
Our next Bugathon will be held from 2009 - 01 - 30 to 2009 - 02-01 ( Fri-Sun ) .
We 'll try to handle as many network related bugs as we can .
Our plan is to try to work through all network related PRs still open in GNATS .
We need a number of maintainers in the area of networking ( drivers , chipsets , protocols , userland processes ) to attend and committers willing to commit fixes and improvements .
Of course , we also need users and administrators with special interest in network related items to be with us to sort out things .
Every helping hand , everyone able to debug and analyze things is welcome .
If you 're interested in getting networking stuff improved , join us to make the upcoming releases of 7.2 and 8.0 the best ever FreeBSD releases .
Join us on IRC : EFnet # FreeBSD - bugbusters from Friday 2009 -01 - 30 to Sunday 2009 - 02-01 .
Do n't miss this event !
The next Bugathon ( TBA ) will have topics in different special interest areas .
Open tasks :
Feel free to ask questions !
You can reach the BugBusting team at bugbusters@FreeBSD.org .
Be there !
Work with us !
Join the team - be a part !

We will be having our next Bugathon on 2009 - 01 - 30 to 2009 - 02-01 ( see this entry ) .
At the recent DevSummit in Strasbourg , the participants spent half a day working through the current " recommended PRs " list .
The list was divided up into sections by date , and each table was assigned one section to work through .
Not only were a good number of fixes committed and their PRs closed , but the src developers were brought up to speed on the triage work that the BugBusting team has been doing ( see below ) .
We hope to build on this momentum in the future .
In addition , many new ideas for improved report pages were discussed .
We continue to make good progress in categorizing PRs as they arrive with ' tags ' that correspond to manpages .
As a result , we now have created some prototype reports that allow browsing the database by manpage .
In addition , another new report , oriented towards PR submitters , summarizes the most commonly reported issues .
Many of these issues persist because they are difficult to fix .
Before filing a PR , you may want to check through this list .
As well , we now have a more active set of volunteers who are willing to help users with reported problems of the form " xyz does not seem to work " .
These types of reports are now being handled much better than in the past .
One of those volunteers , Bruce Cran ( brucec@ ) , has now been released from mentorship .
Mark Linimon ( linimon@ ) continues to work on more new prototype reports , including :
The commonly reported issues summary page , previously maintained by Jeremy Chadwick , has been moved to a new location .
The overall PR count jumped to over 5600 during the 6.4/7.1 release cycle , but has come down a bit .
Open tasks :
Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing PRs that the team has already analyzed .
Think of some way for committers to only view PRs that have been in some way ' vetted ' or ' confirmed ' .
Generate more publicity for what we 've already got in place , and for what we intend to do next .
Define new categories , classifications , and states for PRs , that will better match our workflow .

We ended the year raising over $ 282,000 !
We received 173 donations just in December .
We are very grateful to all the people who helped us come very close to our 2008 goal .
Three projects were started that are being funded by the foundation .
They are Safe Removal of Active Disk Devices , Improvements to the FreeBSD TCP Stack , and Network Stack Virtualization Projects .
Click here to find out more about the projects .
We were a sponsor for meetBSD .
We provided a travel grant for a developer to attend this conference .
We also handed out a few limited edition foundation vests for developer recognition .

VuXML generator ( " wizard " ) is intended for end -users who want to generate VuXML ( XML ) definitions .
Users can just fill out an HTML form & this removes some of the guesswork and the learning curve .
The resulting VuXML can be submitted via send - pr as - is for inclusion into the portaudit database .
Open tasks :
Option to submit generated XML into a " review " queue somewhere ( thus eliminate the need for users to run send - pr at all )
Option to generate OVAL definition in addition to VuXML Option to generate ready - to - run pr ( e.g send - pr -f < outputfile > )

Most of the effort in the last quarter has been QA effort for 6.4 - RELEASE and 7.1 - RELEASE .
Since that time , we have once again begun work on experimental package runs .
The ports count has jumped to over 19,600 .
The PR count had jumped during the freeze / slush cycle for release , but has now dropped back to its usual count of around 900 .
GNOME has been updated to 2.24.3 .
KDE has been updated to 4.1.4 .
X. Org has been updated to 7.4 .
The following large changes are in the pipeline :
Introduction of Perl 5.10 .
We are currently building packages for amd64 - 6 , amd64 - 7 , amd64- 8 , i386 - 6 , i386 - 7 , i386 - 8 , sparc64 - 6 , and sparc64 - 7 .
Several new i386 and sparc64 machines have been added , which has helped speed up the builds .
We especially appreciate the loan of a number of sparc64 machines by Gavin Atkinson .
We have added 5 new committers since the last report , and 2 older ones have rejoined .
Open tasks :
Most of the remaining ports PRs are " existing port / PR assigned to committer " .
Although the maintainer - timeout policy is helping to keep the backlog down , we are going to need to do more to get the ports in the shape they really need to be in .
Although we have added many maintainers , we still have over 4,700 unmaintained ports ( see , for instance , the list on portsmon ) .
( The percentage hovers around 24 % . )
We are always looking for dedicated volunteers to adopt at least a few unmaintained ports .
As well , the packages on amd64 and sparc64 lag behind i386 , and we need more testers for those .

Since the last status report both 7.1 - RELEASE ( 5 January 2009 ) and 6.4 - RELEASE ( 28 November 2008 ) have been released .
Starting with 6.4 - RELEASE , a new DVD ISO image called " dvd1 " is provided for amd64/i386 .
This image contains everything that is on the CDROM discs .
So " dvd1 " can be used to do a full installation that includes a basic set of packages , it has all of the documentation for all supported languages , and it can be used for booting into a " live CD - based filesystem " and system rescue mode .
6.4 - RELEASE was the last release of the 6.X branch , we have currently no plan for any other 6.X release since most of the developers are focused on 8 - CURRENT and 7.X .
The long awaited 7.1 - RELEASE is out since 5th of January .
This release process was far too long from everyone 's point of view .
Working on another release ( 6.4 - RELEASE ) at the same time was not helping the things , but we are aware of many problems that need to be worked on to ease the whole release process .
As a consequence , we are currently working on a new plan for future 7.X ( or 8.0 ) release .
We plan to :
Reduce the freeze period of ports tree , the freeze should occur near the end of the release process during RC cycle
Change the way showstoppers are handled and do not stop a release process for non-important issues or lack of features .
Some work has also been done on the documentation build , we want to provide a more flexible way to install docs ( Handbook , FAQ , etc. ) and detach the documentation build from the release build to use instead ports ( packages ) .
This should make release building easier on slow architectures .
Hopefully this switch will be done for 7.2- RELEASE or 8.0 - RELEASE .
Regarding the time line , we still plan to release 8.0 - RELEASE in mid-June 2009 .
A time for the 7.2 - RELEASE has not been set yet .

snd_hda ( 4 ) audio driver was significantly improved to provide better functionality according to High Definition Audio ( HDA ) and Universal Audio Architecture ( UAA ) specifications .
According to HDA specification , driver now supports multiple codecs per HDA bus and multiple audio functional groups per codec .
According to UAA specification , driver now implements idea of multiple logical audio devices per audio functional group .
It means , that depending on specific system needs , single audio codec may provide several independent functions .
For example , main multichannel output , headset input / output and digital SPDIF / HDMI audio input / output .
Each of these functions are provided as separate pcm devices and can be used independently .
Comparing to ALSA and OSS HDA drivers which are heavily tuned to support each specific codec in every specific system , this driver uses advanced codec tracing logic which allows it to support most of existing HDA codecs and systems without any special tuning , using only information provided by system and codec itself .
This also allows user to widely reconfigure logical audio devices in his system for his own needs , just by specifying wanted audio connectors usage in device .
hints .
Also new driver implements SPDIF / HDMI digital audio , suspend / resume and initial parts of multichannel support .
Open tasks :
Implement input - to - output audio bypass tracing for codecs where bypass signal is not taken from main input mixer .
Improve amplifiers control logic for cases where one signal can be controlled in several points .
Implement multichannel playback , that required significant sound ( 4 ) modifications .

The multi-IPv4 / v6 / no- IP jails project patch has finally been committed to FreeBSD - CURRENT at the end of November .
As an alternate solution to full network stack virtualization , this work shall provide a lightweight solution for multi-IP virtualization .
The changes are even more important because of the emerging demand for IPv6 .
Ideally this will be merged to FreeBSD 7 before 7.2 - RELEASE and stay in FreeBSD 8 for the transitional period to full network stack virtualization .
Since the commit a few minor things have been fixed and work to address most of the remaining old jails PRs has almost been finished .
The fallout from ports breakage has been handled with help from Erwin Lansing from the PortMgr Team .
Contact : Bjoern A. Zeeb < bz@FreeBSD.org >
Contact : Marko Zec < zec@FreeBSD.org >
The network stack virtualization project aims at extending the FreeBSD kernel to maintain multiple independent instances of networking state .
This allows for networking independence between jail - like environments , each maintaining its own private network interfaces , IPv4 and IPv6 network and port address space , routing tables , IPSec configuration , firewalls , and more .
During BSDCan 2007 an initial commit plan had been worked out .
The Developer Summit at Cambridge in August brought the first parts of VImage into the kernel .
Marko gave a summary and outlook at EuroBSDCon in Strasbourg .
From autumn until December all but the last step had been committed by Marko .
Druing December Bjoern was able to work full time on VImage because of FreeBSD Foundation funding .
In addition to helping with reviews , summarizing things on the Wiki , a virtual cross-over Ethernet - like interface pair was developed to be able to bring networking to an instances without the mandatory need of netgraph .
The next steps will be to bring in the most important last step giving us multiple network stacks .
After that all developers will be able to help to find ( and fix ) bugs .
Further subsystems not yet addressed will need to be virtualized then .
In addition to this Jamie Gritton 's management interface will be imported .

Support for Intel ( TM ) Atom / Core / Core2 family PMCs was added to PmcTools .
Bugs in the toolset were tracked down and fixed , and the ABI between libpmc ( 3 ) and hwpmc ( 4 ) was reworked to hopefully be more future proof .

FreeBSD mmc( 4 ) / mmcsd ( 4 ) stack was improved to support all MMC / SD card types existing now .
Support was added for SD High Capacity ( SDHC ) cards and MultiMediaCards ( MMC ) memory cards of normal ( up to 2GB ) and high capacity .
Support was also added for 4/8 bits wide buses , High Speed timings and multi-block transfers allows to reach speeds up to 25 MB /s ( SD ) and 52MB /s ( MMC ) depending on which card and controller was used .
Added SD Host Controller driver , sdhci ( 4 ) , that implements support for SD specification compatible PCI SD / MMC card readers to be used with mmc ( 4 ) / mmcsd ( 4 ) stack .
Driver supports PIO and DMA transfers , 1 / 4 bits buses , high speed timings , card insert / remove detection and write protection .
Open tasks :
Many of the existing SD Host Controllers have undocumented registers beyond SD specification .
Some of them are unable to detect the card without some additional initialization implemented .

This work is bringing support for another Book - E style PowerPC implementation ( PPC440/460 core ) embedded in a wide range of system - on - chip devices .
Current state highlights :
Locore kernel initialisation
TLB handling
Console ( UART )
Interrupts controller ( UIC )
USB controller ( OHCI , EHCI )
Multi user operation
The CPU layer ( kernel start - up , TLB handling ) is derived from existing E500 support .
Eventually the code will be re-factored so that the common logic is shared between processor variations and only the lowest - level routines are provided separately .
A number of drivers for peripherals integrated on the chip needs to be written ( Ethernet , PCI / PCI - Express , crypto engines , SATA , I2C , SPI , GPIO and others ) .

FreeBSD 8.0 - CURRENT
now has basic support for sun4u- machines based on UltraSPARC III and beyond .
This is still a work in progress though due to the diversity of these machines , hardware errata and bugs in machine independent parts of FreeBSD showing up .
A install image with the latest code which in comparison to the official snapshot 200812 contains more dcons ( 4 ) fixes , an isp ( 4 ) working with 10160 and 12160 on sparc64 , an endian - clean mpt ( 4 ) as needed for the on - board controller found in Fire V440 , workarounds needed for Fire V880 and a fix for machines with more than 8GB of RAM ( tested with 16GB ) are available at the above URL .
Known working machines so far are :
Blade 1000
Blade 1500
Blade 2000
Fire 280R
Fire V210
Fire V440 ( except for the on - board NICs )
Fire V880
Netra 20 / Netra T4
The stability of FreeBSD on these machines is en par with that on pre-USIII - based sun4u- machines .
Machines similar to the ones above like for example Fire V240 should also just work with all essential on - board devices , i.e. serial console , ATA / SCSI controller and NIC , being supported .
So far the intention is to MFC this code in time for FreeBSD 7.2 .
Open tasks :
Apart from serial devices , only cards supported by creator ( 4 ) are currently usable as console , i.e. not even machf b ( 4 ) works in sun4u- machines based on UltraSPARC III or beyond at this point ( it will trigger a RED state exception , which should not be that hard to fix though ) , let alone XVR graphics cards .
A driver for the Sun Cassini / Cassini + as well as National Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit NICs found on - board for example in Fire V440 and as add - on cards is under development but still needs some work .
There is no driver for controlling the fans in machines based on the Excalibur board , yet .
This means that Blade 1000 / 2000 are not very usable as workstations so far due to the noise caused by the fans permanently running at full speed .
There is no support for host - to - PCI - Express or host - to - PCI - X bridges so far , at least for the latter due to lack of access to such machines .
Adding support for the XMITS PCI -X bridges to the existing schizo ( 4 ) should be rather straightforward , PCI - Express will require a new driver and probably some additional tweaking though .

Some bugs have been fixed in the buffering and binary file detection parts of grep .
Due to the differences between the GNU regexp library and our libc regexp implementation , I switched to the GNU library so that we can maintain an acceptable level of compatibility .
The desired option would be to drop both GNU grep and the GNU regexp library , but unfortunately we cannot just do that because of these incompatibilities .
Accordingly , the first step should be replacing grep and then we should review and optimize our regexp library .
With this decision , BSD grep has acquired a higher level of compatibility and now seems to be much more useful .
Open tasks :
Make a portbuild run with BSD grep and fix possible bugs .

The MagLev demo at RailsConf 2008 demonstrated Gemstone 's distributed VM technology , which allows to share the same object memory transparently across multiple Gemstone VMs .
Terracotta is a Java technology that allows something similar .
Fabio Kung has now started experimenting to let JRuby take advantage of Terracotta .
Similar projects have been attempted in the past .
Gemstone also experimented with supporting JRuby on top of their Java based product and there was a previous attempt of JRuby on Terracotta , although that has n't been updated in some time .
We talked to Fabio Kung about his project , which he refers to as " JMaglev " , about what 's involved in getting JRuby and Terracotta to work together and which problems need to be solved before it will work .
First off , Fabio explains his implementation and how he had to modify JRuby to make it work :
I 'm using Terracotta POJO clustering to make JRuby internals shared to all cluster nodes .
In fact , each runtime has a collection of global variables , something like :
public class Ruby { // ... private GlobalVariables globalVariables = new GlobalVariables ( ) ; } and : public class GlobalVariables { // ... private List values = new ArrayList ( ) ;
}
Terracotta is just clustering this global variables list .
Any change to that list is replicated to all JRuby runtimes in the cluster .
The beauty is that you can add _any_ ruby object to this list , even complicated objects like regexps , hashes and procs .
All global variables are automatically shared and any object referenced by a global variable is instrumented by Terracotta to be clustered .
To support it , I had to patch JRuby , making it " clusterizable " .
In fact , every ruby object in JRuby maintains a hard reference to the ruby runtime .
Shared objects must be used in many different runtimes , so JRuby must support some kind of runtime attachment / detachment .
I was able to make it work , but only with one Ruby Runtime per JVM .
There are still unresolved and to be discussed issues in this area , here are some :
- global object identities : should object_id be the same in all nodes ?
- shared metaclasses : what happens when the object class , superclasses or included modules are changed in different nodes ?
- support for many runtimes per JVM
I took simple solutions to all of these problems , but each solution would require an entire blog post . ;-)
Fabio explains the use cases he has in mind for JRuby and Terracotta :
In conjunction with Terracotta 's High Availability mode , I think " JMaglev " ( perhaps it needs a better name ) can indeed be a reliable alternative to memcached without being intrusive in the Ruby code .
But there 's a lot of work to be done .
That is the reason I have made it public ; anyone who wants can contribute .
http://github.com/fabiokung/clustered-jruby/
Many servers can be configured in Terracotta , with one being the " master " ( or active server ) and others in hot - standby mode .
Here is where things start to become more interesting , because if the active server crashes , other automatically takes place to increase availability .
There is even a mode available in the Enterprise version of Terracotta that enables multiple active servers , similar to what is achieved with memcached , but memcached does n't makes objects persistent .
Terracotta might act as a distributed cache and does n't use Java serialization : it just replicates what changes .
You have only to make objects you would retrieve from the database shared to all cluster nodes .
With JMaglev , it means you have just to put them in global variables - $ shared = Person.find ( :all ) .
Other possible use case is HttpSession sharing among many processes and machines in Rails applications .
People deploying rails applications to JRuby could use the transparent clustered objects to maintain HttpSessions shared to all cluster nodes .
In fact , any Terracotta use case is a JMaglev use case .
Honestly , I 've done it just because it can be done .
Pretty much similar to Avy Briant 's Maglev case : he said it would be possible to use SmallTalk VMs to run Ruby code , then Gemstone guys called him to prove it could indeed be done . ;-)
I 'm expecting people more creative than I can come with more creative use cases for " JMaglev " .
Distributed object memory is just one of the features of Gemstone / S ( and MagLev ) ; another important feature is persistence .
As Gemstone 's Monty Williams explains in a recent episode or the Rails Podcast , Gemstone / S supports persisting the object memory , which means there 's no need for an ORM or even a RDBMS to store data .
When asked about whether " JMaglev " could support something similar , Fabio explains :
All shared ruby objects live in the Terracotta Server , which can automatically persist those objects , even when they are n't Serializable .
Clients hold stubs to the real , shared objects .
You just have to configure the server to be in persistent mode .
I have n't tested it yet , but it should be one line of XML configuration .
I think Terracotta could be used as an OODB to persist JRuby objects , although I do n't think it is currently the primary goal .
Terracotta is already persisting shared objects through its High Availability mode , that exists for fail - safe - high - available deployments .
http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/docs/Configuring+Terracotta+For+High+Availability.
Terracotta 's website lists many Terracotta Integration Modules ( TIM ) , some of them for popular ORM solutions .
When asked if these could help with persistence , Fabio explains that these TIMs serve a different purpose :
Those Terracotta Integration Modules ( TIM ) are n't related to automatic persistence for shared objects .
They are just helping Terracotta to be used in conjunction with those ORM frameworks .
The hibernate TIM , for example , has n't anything to do with persistence .
It just enables Hibernate to use a clustered ( distributed ) EhCache ( and others ) with little effort , without having to appeal to true distributed caches like JBoss TreeCache and memcached .
Fabio has put a screencast showing of how the sharing with JRuby and Terracotta works .
To try this , see Fabio 's clustered - jruby repository at Github provides everything necessary .
Mr Brown 's spokesman confirmed that a full inquiry into the war would go ahead when the " time is right " , adding : " We do not believe it would be right to have an inquiry whilst our troops are still engaged in operations in Iraq . "
EXCLUSIVE : Three cheers for Eduardo as he returns in hat - trick style for Arsenal
EXCLUSIVE
by NEIL ASHTON
He 's back .
A hat - trick for the reserves against the first team is his message .
Arsenal have a new striker in the transfer window .
Eduardo is his name , looking a picture of health compared to the last time he was seen in the Barclays Premier League .
We can all remember the ugly scenes on February 23 last year .
Eduardo was lying motionless , his body still in shock following the challenge by Birmingham defender Martin Taylor that left the striker with a broken left fibula and dislocated left ankle .

Shocking : Birmingham City's Martin Taylor scythes down Eduardo at St Andrew's
Some of his team - mates could not look , Cesc Fabregas covering his face with his hands as former Arsenal physio Gary Lewin sprinted on to the pitch at St Andrew's .
Eduardo said : ' At first I could n't believe that this was happening to me .
Then I thought , " No , this is how it is " , so I resolved to try to do everything I could to come back as quickly as possible . '
Sky Sports , who were screening the game live , decided not to show the collision again , fearing a backlash if they continued to analyse the fracture from different camera angles .
Then there were the conflicting stories about whether Taylor , who was sent off and later made a public apology , visited Eduardo in the Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham where he was initially treated .

Agony : Eduardo lies stricken with the injury that has left him out for nearly a year
Eduardo said : ' My wife said he was there , but he came along at the time when I was having surgery .
She obviously did n't know him , until one of the doctors pointed him out and said , " That 's the guy " .
' I was n't conscious so I do n't remember seeing or speaking to him .
He has been in touch via email , though .
Before my comeback for the reserves last month he sent me a message to wish me luck and to say he was glad I was back in action .
' I had faxes and emails from people who had the same sort of injury , telling me to be calm and not worry because it would get back to normal .
Robbie Savage , Alan Smith and David Busst were three of those who were in touch with positive thoughts .
' When I was in hospital I realised I had to take this process step by step , so I started setting gradual goals .
First of all it was to see how things were going day by day , so every day was a victory in that way .
' Then , as the injury was getting better , I started pushing every week to see how I was improving , and then it got to the point where it had been so long that I was taking things monthly until I actually got back to training .'
Nearly a year after his left leg buckled under the force of that thunderous challenge , the Arsenal striker is preparing to make his first - team comeback .
Distraught : Taylor reflects on challenge
' That will be his reward for two operations and eight hours a day he spent in rehabilitation .
He has never seen the incident , preferring to concentrate on his fight for fitness and target a return to the Arsenal team .
' I did n't look at anything about the injury , the game , what happened , and I 've not even watched the incident since , ' he added in an interview that appears in the Official Arsenal Magazine .
' There were ups and downs with this story and its focus , really .
My X - rays and all the injury footage were asked for by doctors all around the world for use at universities and in various studies , to show students how the medicine and repair process worked .
If it had happened in Africa , I would have lost my foot .
In other countries I probably would n't be playing football again .
As it happened , it was in Europe , which has more developed facilities .
' I was also thinking about how strong it was for kids to watch , that was a major concern for me , in terms of how it might affect them and their views about playing football . '
He spent four months convalescing in Brazil , spending time with his family as he fixed his sights on a successful return to Arsene Wenger 's team .
It took nine months for the striker , signed from Dinamo Zagreb at the start of last season , to emerge from the shadows , training with his team - mates again at London Colney and sharpening his striking instincts .
When he scored his hat - trick , it was a small signal to his manager and his team - mates .
Surely they had taken it easy on him ?
' I did n't think they changed anything really , but , of course , we are all members of the same group and nobody 's going to tackle you in training as they would an opponent in a match anyway , ' he said .

Thumbs up : Eduardo back in action for Arsenal against Burnley in the FA Cup
' There 's a lot of respect and care shown to each other .
So I could n't feel them being soft on me because I 'd had the injury , just being soft generally because we 're all careful in training not to injure our friends and colleagues .
Plus , I had prepared during my recovery so that I did n't feel any worries .
If I stepped out there it was because I was ready , so there was no reason for anything to be different . '
He then made a successful return for the reserves last month against Portsmouth , reminding the manager he can solve the club 's shortage of goals when he is fully fit .
That will not be far away after he recovered from a hamstring strain but Wenger will not rush him back .
' The way I see it , if I could play now I would do , but obviously I do n't feel that I can go to the Emirates and be at my very best just yet .
' Until then I want to play in every single game that I can for the reserves .
I want to be there to make sure that I 'm moving further and further forward , until the boss thinks I am ready . '
When he is , he will be guaranteed a hero 's reception .

Stonewalling is defined as a .
To engage in delaying tactics ; stall : b. To refuse to answer or cooperate .
The best description I 've read of stonewalling comes from , Jeffrey J. Pipe , PsyD . "
In relationships , stonewalling is the emotional equivalent to cutting off someone ’s oxygen .
The emotional detachment inherent to stonewalling is a form of abandonment and the effect that it has on a spouse is dramatic .
The initial feelings of terror which are usually below the water line of awareness are typically followed by secondary feelings of anger and , then , aggressive efforts to get some emotional reaction any emotional reaction even a negative one .
And when these efforts fail , the internal response for your spouse is predictable .
He does n't care .
He does n't love me .
He 's left me . "
What exactly does stonewalling look like in a marriage ?
From the description above , emotional detachment and feelings of abandonment leave the victim spouse reeling with doubt , anger , and doubt of an emotional connection with their spouse .
Below are 4 examples of stonewalling in a relationship
1 . Your wife has done something that hurts your feelings or , there is a problem in the marriage that you wish to discuss with her .
Your attempts to communicate your feelings over the situation are met with silence .
Her way of avoiding conflict is to refuse to participate in the conversation .
2 . Your husband spends all weekend watching sports instead of participating in family activities .
You sit with him , explain to him that you do n’t have a problem with him watching sports but would like for him to take a few hours of his weekend to spend with the family .
He responds by folding his arms and muttering , “ whatever . ”
Then he is back to watching the game .
He is totally disconnected from the family and what the family needs from him .
3 . Your wife is a shopaholic , so much so that you begin to worry about the financial repercussions of her spending habits .
You feel a need to discuss the problem with her and set some boundaries on her spending .
Half way through the conversation she changes the subject ; it is no longer about her shopping but now about how much time you spend at work .
Her taking the spotlight off of her faults and shining it on yours is a display of smugness .
“ How dare you point out my flaws , when you have flaws of your own . ”
4 . You are not happy with the lack of intimacy in your marriage .
Your husband shows no interest in you or sex with you and it is time to communicate the level of pain and rejection you are feeling .
You tell him you are worried about the lack of sex in the marriage , that you want to come up with some solutions to this problem and he walks away .
He removes himself from the conversation and the room altogether .
He has already distanced himself from you intimately , now he is distancing himself from you physically .
Not only does he not want sex with you , he does n’t want to talk to you either .
OUCH !
Use of extreme , stonewalling is a way for one spouse to manipulate the other spouse into getting what they want .
Stonewalling is a dismissal of what is good for the marriage and both spouses in favor of what is good for the one spouse .
Men are more prone to stonewall in a relationship because they feel overwhelmed when a wife wants to “ talk feelings ” or “ discuss problems . ”
We often hear men accuse their wives of “ nagging ” which , more often than not is in response to their stonewalling her and her need to discuss marital problems .
Not that women do n’t stonewall which results in as much damage but men , who are wired to withdraw and think about a problem , are more likely to use this avoidance tactic more often than women who are more open to communicating feelings and needs .
According to John Gottman , " A marriage succeeds to the extent that the husband can accept influence from his wife .
If a woman says , ' Do you have to work Thursday night ?
My mother is coming that weekend , and I need your help getting ready , ' and her husband replies , ' My plans are set , and I 'm not changing them ' .
This guy is in a shaky marriage .
A husband 's ability to be influenced by his wife ( rather than vice - versa ) is crucial because research shows women are already well practiced at accepting influence from men , and a true partnership only occurs when a husband can do so as well . "
This is typically what happens , the wife nags , the husband becomes defensive and stonewalls by refusing to engage in communication over what the wife views as a problem in the marriage .
The wife nags more and becomes angrier and more frustrated .
As a result , you have a husband who is angry because his wife is constantly “ nagging ” and a wife who is angry because her husband is constantly “ stonewalling . ”
Stonewalling is a form of emotional suppression
Not only does stonewalling damage the marital relationship it is harmful to each spouse physiologically .
Men who suppress their emotions and refuse to engage in communication can experience health problems with the autonomic nervous system and heart .
In reaction to her husband ’s stonewalling , the level of stress a wife feels can cause her to suffer the same health problems PLUS anxiety disorders and depression .
The key to reducing stonewalling in a relationship does n’t lie with the spouse who tends to do the stonewalling .
It is the wife , the “ nagging wife ” who holds the key .
Bet you did n’t expect that did you ?
When a man is criticized he feels his wife views him as the “ bad guy . ”
The fastest way to get a man to shut down is the give him the impression you think he has done or is doing something bad .
If a wife wants to have influence over her husband she needs to learn to communicate without putting him on the defensive .
1. Disengage :
When we disengage , we set aside differences temporarily , while we remain willing to address them at a later time .
It involves taking time to reflect , reduce the tension , and let our emotions settle .
2. Empathize :
To empathize is to put ourselves figuratively in the other person 's place .
That very act will help squelch defensiveness because we acknowledge what the other person is feeling .
3. Inquire :
When we inquire , we uncover the concerns of the other person .
Asking questions allows us to focus on our task rather than our disagreement .
After we inquire , we need to listen carefully , giving the other person our complete attention .
4. Disclose :
When we disclose , we reveal our feelings , needs , and goals to the other person .
We can do this with " I statements " that describe our emotions , the precipitating event , and its tangible impact .
5. Depersonalize :
When we depersonalize , we evaluate behavior rather than the person , and we look at our work as something we do rather than what we are .
This allows us to free ourselves and others from the need to respond defensively .
Noble Says Three New York Wind Farms are Operational
January 30th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
Noble Environmental
Power has completed work on three wind farms in New York , and all three sites are generating power , a company spokeswoman said .
The three projects will produce about 328 megawatts , enough energy to power about 110,000 homes , the Essex , Conn . - based company said .
The three sites and their capacities are : Altona , Clinton County , 97.5 MW ; Chateaugay , Franklin , County , 106.5 MW ; and Wethersfield , Wyoming County , 124 MW .
All three sites are using General Electric turbines .
As credit markets worsen , some companies , including Noble , have put certain projects on hold .
In November , Noble announced it was scaling back its 2009 plans , and it laid off some workers .
But despite the condition of the economy , wind power projects continue to spring up in New York , because of the consistent prevailing winds off Lake Erie and Lake Ontario .
New York has over 700 MW of wind generating capacity in use , and a goal of adding 8,000 MW more .
State officials have said they want to meet 25 percent of the state ’s power needs with wind .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to use more wind power in the Big Apple too .

Barack Obama , in his first foreign trip as US president , has pledged to work with Canada on energy , trade , economic recovery and Afghanistan .
In Canada 's capital , Ottawa , he said global challenges , including security , required a global response .
He did not press PM Stephen Harper on the planned pull - out of Canadian troops from Afghanistan in 2011 , he said .
Mr Obama also assured his country 's biggest trade partner that he would not pursue protectionist policies .
" Now is a time where we have to be very careful about any signals of protectionism , " Mr Obama told a joint news conference after talks with Mr Harper and senior members of his cabinet on the one - day visit .
As America 's biggest trade partner , Canada is worried about the " Buy American " measures in Mr Obama 's $ 787bn ( £ 546 bn ) stimulus plan .
Under the provision , public works funded by the package should use only iron , steel and other goods made in the US , although the bill does state that international trade obligations will be respected .
One of the oddities of the Obama / Canada relationship is that he is so far to the left of Stephen Harper 's conservative government
North America editor Justin Webb
Read Justin's thoughts in full " If we pursue stimulus packages , the goal of which is only to benefit ourselves , or to benefit ourselves , worse , at the expense of others , we will deepen the world recession , not solve it , " Mr Harper warned .
But Mr Obama stressed that the US would comply with its treaty obligations regarding international trade .
He said he wanted " to grow trade and not contract it " .
The two countries are the world 's largest trading partners , with about $ 1.5 bn - worth of goods crossing the border each day .
Mr Obama announced a " clean energy dialogue " between the two countries to " advance carbon - reduction technologies " that will combat climate change .
The president received a warm welcome from the prime minister
It would also " support the development of an electric grid that can help deliver the clean and renewable energy of the future to homes and businesses " in both countries , the US president added .
Environmental activists have urged Mr Obama to get tough with Canada about its massive oil sands operation which produces a high amount of greenhouse gases blamed for climate change .
And on the war in Afghanistan , Mr Obama said he had not pressed Mr Harper on the Canadian decision to withdraw the bulk of its forces in 2011 .
The US , concerned at the resurgent Taleban in Afghanistan , has said it will increase its forces in Afghanistan by 17,000 , and expects allies to do more too .
" I certainly did not press the prime minister on any additional commitments beyond ones that have already been made . "
Canada has about 2,800 troops in Afghanistan ; 108 have been killed .
Popular president President Obama was greeted at Ottawa 's airport by Canadian Governor General Michaelle Jean and an escort of Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Ms Jean is a Haitian immigrant and Canada 's first black governor general - the representative of Queen Elizabeth , Canada 's titular head of state .
Busloads of Obama supporters went to Ottawa , hoping for a glimpse of the president , in contrast to the thousands of protesters who descended on the capital for President George W Bush 's visit in 2004 .
Mr Obama is very popular in Canada : 66 % of Canadians wanted him to be president , according to a Gallup opinion poll .
About 2,000 people braved the cold , snowy weather to get a glimpse of the president as he met Mr Harper at the parliament building and turned to give the crowd a wave .
Mr Obama also met opposition Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff before he returned to Washington .

Death and more death in Gaza
By DAVID T. WRIGHT
If you find this article of value , please send a donation of $ 3 to TLD .
More information appears below .
Funny how murder and hypocrisy go hand in hand .
Take the Israeli siege of Gaza .
Siege is an ancient and cruel weapon .
It consists simply of surrounding a population  until recently , usually a walled city or castle  and not allowing anything in or out .
Typically the siege ends when the inhabitants begin to die of starvation , thirst , or disease , and decide to surrender .
Sieges are mentioned in the Old Testament : the siege of the Canaanite city of Jericho was won by the Israelite general Joshua in only seven days by supernatural means .
The siege of Troy is another ancient example , as is the Roman siege of the Jewish Zealots at Masada .
Medieval armies used immense catapults and , later , cannon to batter stone walls ; tunnels to undermine them ( thus giving rise to the military term " mine "  when gunpowder became available it was exploded in the mines underneath the walls ) ; and disease - infected corpses flung into the besieged city or castle to hurry things along .
More recent sieges include Lincoln 's sieges of Vicksburg and Petersburg during the War of Northern Aggression , the particularly brutal German siege of Leningrad in the Second World War , and the Clinton regime 's siege - massacre of the Branch Davidians at Waco .
And we must n't forget the Bush Jong - il regime 's siege of Fallujah in 2004 , in which Imperial storm troopers prevented thousands of civilians from fleeing the city , which was then pulverized by air strikes and artillery fire .
It remains one of the most horrifying and shameful episodes of the Empire 's ongoing persecution of the Iraqis .
By their very nature sieges are a very nasty business .
Unless the target is a purely military one , which is usually not the case , it is innocent civilians , especially children , who suffer the most from them .
For that reason , sieges are frowned upon in international law and in civilized society .
The Geneva Conventions allow sieges , or blockades as they are called when carried out by naval forces , only in limited circumstances , to prevent harm to civilian populations .
Those restrictions are routinely flouted by right - thinking rulers such as our own , who often use modified siege tactics called " sanctions " to brutalize populations who have committed the unpardonable sin of living under uncooperative dictators .
The " sanctions " imposed on the Iraqi people by Bush Il- sung and Clinton ( through the agency of the United Nations ) are an outstanding example of such outrages .
The Empire said they were designed to encourage Saddam Hussein to pay reparations for his invasion of Kuwait and , later , to disclose the whereabouts of his non-existent Weapons of Mass Destruction .
Their actual  and , I believe , desired  effect was to destroy what had been a relatively prosperous and advanced Arab economy , reducing its members to penury , malnutrition , and often death .
Even items that were supposed to be allowed under the rules of the sanctions , such as medical supplies and nutritional items for infants , were kept out on the specious grounds that they had military utility .
The result was possibly a million deaths , of which at least half were children . [ 1 ]
And now the Judeo - Nazi regime of Israel is laying siege to the people of Gaza , who are guilty of the crime of voting for the wrong party .
In parliamentary elections held in January 2006 , Hamas won a surprise victory in the occupied territories of Palestine against the massively corrupt and increasingly unpopular Fatah party .
Unfortunately , the regimes of Israel and the United State did not look upon that development with equanimity , even though they had hailed what they called the " free " elections as heralding the arrival of " democracy " for the benighted Palestinians .
Hamas was prevented from taking power , because it was labeled a " terrorist organization . "
That was despite the fact that Hamas had unilaterally initiated a truce two years before , a truce that they had broken only once or twice , each time in response to Israeli provocation . [ 2 ]
As I 've pointed out before , whenever affairs begin to tend toward some kind of compromise or accommodation on the part of the Palestinians , the Israeli regime moves to provoke Palestinian outrage .
In the case of the Hamas truce , the Israelis hit an apartment building in Gaza , killing 15 people and wounding 145 , hours after Hamas and its allies agreed among themselves to consider a unilateral cease - fire .
There are numerous other examples .
The reason for Israel 's behavior is simple : the regime does n't want peace .
It wants the Palestinians out so it can take the land .
It can't simply massacre them all , or drive them out wholesale , because of the undesirable effects that would have on its image as the perpetual victim of Arab aggression , and the possible negative consequences for its gravy train of funds from the United State .
So it makes life as hard as it can for the despised Arabs .
True to form , in June 2006 the Israelis initiated hostilities by shelling a beach in Gaza , ripping to shreds eight Palestinian civilians having a picnic in their bathing suits .
Hamas reacted by firing a large number of primitive artillery rockets , made by hand from scrap metal , into Israel , and by raiding a military outpost in Israel and kidnapping an Israeli soldier .
The Israelis then raised the stakes by kidnapping eight Hamas cabinet members and 56 other officials .
Meanwhile , an attempt by Hamas to placate the " international community " by cooking up a grand coalition government with the discredited Fatah broke down , and Hamas forcibly established its rule in Gaza , with the overwhelming support of the population .
The Israelis gleefully seized upon the opportunity to inflict further hardship on the people there , having prepared the ground first by removing the small number of Israeli settlements .
Gaza was put under a vicious siege , with only " humanitarian aid "  in reality just enough food to keep the desperate population from starving to death en masse  allowed in .
With the enthusiastic help of the Empire , the Egyptian state was coerced into closing its common border with Gaza as well .
And there things remained for nearly three years : the Gazan people suffering unimaginable hardship , cut off from all commerce , living in stinking squalor with no sanitation , dying like animals in hospitals devoid of the most basic necessities .
And all because they voted wrong .
So much for " democracy . "
The response from the Gazans has been pitiful , to say the least .
Some rockets are fired from time to time into Israel .
They usually have no effect at all , besides creating noise , although occasionally one hits something and causes some damage .
It should be pointed out that it is not clear who is responsible for the rockets 
Hamas has probably been involved with at least some of them , but it is no great trick to make one , and there are other factions running around in Gaza , too , over which the Hamas leadership has little or no control .
The Israeli answer to desperate attempts on the part of Hamas to reach an agreement are breathtaking in their hypocrisy .
The siege will not be lifted , they pompously intone , until all rocket attacks stop .
If just one is fired , the people will keep starving .
Obviously , that has not had the effect we 're supposed to believe was intended : rocket attacks keep happening , and just for good measure the Israelis once in a while stage an attack to shake things up and keep the people good and angry .
The Hamas government does not have the resources to stop all the rocketing , a state of affairs that suits the Israelis just fine .
Then , in late December , the Israeli generals decided to liven things up .
They launched one of their patented rampages , hitting numerous targets in Gaza with bombs and artillery , including TV stations and police stations , clearly with the intent of causing massive loss of life .
( It may seem strange to target policemen when you are calling on them to hunt down and stop the people who are firing rockets , but there you are . )
It 's funny .
If Saddam Hussein or the Serbs had carried out such a shockingly brutal policy against an enemy as pitiful and helpless , the righteous outcry by all bien - pensant governments , pundits , TV talking heads , and other parasites would have been deafening .
You would n't have been able to turn on the telescreen or open a newspaper without being bombarded by exhortations to stop the barbarity .
Senators would have bloviated with such passion they would have seemed almost sincere .
Movie stars and pop singers would have staged fund - raisers and concerts .
Bumper stickers and sloganized T - shirts would have proliferated .
But for this ?
Nothing .
The people of Gaza are lost .
They have nothing to look forward to but suffering , death , and eventual dispossession of even the little they have now .
As they starve and sicken , the " civilized " world looks on with contempt .
May
God help them .

Woman Discovers
She has Two Wombs Doctors told pregnant mother she has two sets of reproductive organs .
Jan. 7 , 2009  -- London resident Lindsay Hasaj assumed she was a pretty ordinary person for the first 27 years of her life .
She had a nice job in financial sales , got married in July and two months later became pregnant .
But within weeks of the news , Hasaj went to the hospital with abdominal pain .
Soon after , doctors discovered she had two sets of reproductive organs ; two vaginas , two cervixes and two wombs .
" It was one of the awful cases of being in the room with the sonographer and they 're being quiet and evading your questions , " said Hasaj .
" Then they get up and say : ' Sorry I have to see one of my superiors . ' "
Hasaj said she was left lying on the examination table in a panic , at most imagining an ectopic pregnancy .
Minutes later the superior came in to look and said quite matter - of - factly , " Oh , by the way you have two wombs and two cervixes , " Hasaj said .
" Oh , my husband was absolutely devastated .
His first concern was for my health , " said Hasaj of her husband , Tony Hasaj .
" But this is our first child and it 's very much a longed - for child , so we are both walking on eggshells at the moment . "
Doctors told Hasaj that she was really very lucky to have conceived so easily and that the baby seemed fine .
The pain , it turned out , was only a coincidence and caused by a common ovarian cyst .
" Everything was on the right side , the baby 's in the womb on the right side , the cyst was on the ovary on the right side , " said Hasaj .
But after that strange announcement came the news that the pregnancy would be high risk .
Hasaj 's doctor , who was unavailable for an interview , estimated in news reports that she had a 60 percent to 65 percent chance of having a healthy baby at the end of a full - term pregnancy .
Studies of womb malformations estimate that one in 3,000 women have Hasaj 's condition of uterus didelphys , according to Dr. Ed Huang , associate director of the OB / GYN Residency Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston .
However , in Huang 's experience , a double uterus is much rarer .
In 14 years of experience as a doctor , caring for 30,000 women , Huang said he has only seen four cases like Hasaj's .
A Lucky Pregnancy With High Risks
" Most of these women end up having a [ Caesarean ] section , " he said , explaining that Hasaj 's condition likely happened during a developmental stage in the womb .
Normally , two long tube organs that become the fallopian tubes fuse together at the bottom to create a vagina , cervix and womb .
But in Hasaj 's case the fusion never occurred .
She now has two halves of a full uterus ; each of Hasaj 's wombs is smaller than a normal womb .
" That increases the risk that the uterus might not be able to stretch to hold a full pregnancy , " said Huang .
Indeed , Hasaj has been told she faces increased risks for premature birth , a breech baby and miscarriage .
" My cervix has to be measured every two weeks , " said Hasaj , who noted her biggest worry for now will be whether her cervix starts to dilate early .
A Life - Changing Pregnancy
With a written letter from her doctor , Hasaj has left work during her pregnancy to reduce stress and stress hormones known to increase the risk of early labor .
" Where for most women the risk of miscarriage drops off after 12 weeks , there 's always a risk for me , " she said .
Hasaj considers herself lucky , but she and husband Tony are n't picking out names yet .
" We 're trying not to get our hopes up too full , " she said .
However , experts such as Dr. Richard J. Paulson , chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles , have some encouraging words .
" Prior to the days of ultrasound most of these cases were discovered at the time of Caesarean , " said Paulson , who has seen other cases of Hasaj 's condition .
Paulson said reproductive malformations ranging from a complete failure of the two tubes to fuse as in Hasaj 's case , to an oddly heart - shaped uterus are relatively common .
" It would be a rare case if she got pregnant in both uteri at the same time , " he said .
Paulson also was n't at all surprised to hear that Hasaj never guessed she had two vaginas or cervixes .
" I do n't want you to imagine that she looks any different on the outside , " he said .
" In regular life , you 're unaware of the anatomy beyond the first couple of centimeters . "
A Difficult Discovery
In pelvic exams , during intercourse or any other normal situation , Paulson said it 's difficult to feel that a person has two vaginas .
Paulson used an analogy of walking into a tent separated by a tarp down the middle with your eyes closed .
" Once inside , you can't feel a difference in the wall , " said Paulson .
" A vast majority of the time these things are n't discovered , even in an exam . "
The same was true for Hasaj , who said she 'd gotten regular annual checkups since she was 18 .
This new discovery finally explains why every other pap smear gave inconclusive results .
" For the last nine years , I 've had so many smears -- possibly 30 different people have given me smear tests , " said Hasaj .
" The doctors said only thing you would have noticed would be you had problems using tampons . "
When she heard that , Hasaj said her history made perfect sense .
" I thought 'oh my god , yes , " said Hasaj , who thought something was strange during the previous periods .
" But I never would have guessed this , " she said .
The Big Failure
everybody agrees , I think , on both sides of the spectrum now , that the New Deal failed .
There are people on the other side of the spectrum who would say , maybe , but look at this as well .
President Roosevelt waged what could only be called a jihad against private enterprise .
He prosecuted leading figures in it , Andrew Mellon being a conspicuous example .
He prosecuted little companies , butcher shops in New York , as has been laid out in Amity Shlaes ' book about the new -- book about the history of the Great Depression .
It created a very uncertain , even poisonous atmosphere for business .
That is not the atmosphere that you want , and I 'm bound to say , Neil , that I do n't think that 's the atmosphere the Obama administration is seeking to create .
The Obama administration is not showing any signs it wanted to wage the kind of war on private business that Roosevelt waged .
The question , of course , still is whether the spending on the scale that we 're seeing will end up doing more harm than good --
Obama ’s team : A right - wing cabinet for a government of big business
By Patrick Martin
19 January 2009
In advance of his inauguration , President - elect Barack Obama has assembled a cabinet drawn from the upper echelons of American society and the right - wing of the Democratic Party .
Despite his invocations of “ change , ” his appeals to antiwar sentiment and to young people in the course of nearly two years of campaigning , there is not a single figure in the leading personnel of the Obama administration drawn from the more liberal elements of the Democratic Party , let alone anyone representative of the broad masses of working people and youth .
The right - wing character of Obama ’s nominees is described by the media under the approving labels of “ centrist , ” “ moderate , ” and — most of all — “ pragmatic . ”
This terminology signifies that the incoming Obama team consists entirely of individuals who pass muster with the corporate - financial elite .
There is not a whiff of genuine oppositional sentiment , let alone political radicalism , among the lot of them .
It is a remarkable fact that if Hillary Clinton had won the Democratic nomination and the presidency instead of Obama , there would be virtually no change in the cabinet selections .
The Washington Post noted Sunday , in its overview of the transition process , that Obama staffers have a running joke : “ If you wanted Obama to win for president , you should have worked on his campaign , but if you wanted to work for him , you should have worked for Hillary . ”
If the most virulently pro-war Democrat in the Senate , Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut , were entering the White House , he would be quite comfortable presiding over a meeting of the cabinet selected by Barack Obama — even though the former professed such sharp opposition to Obama that he campaigned publicly for Republican John McCain last fall .
In its basic policies , the incoming Democratic administration will change the policies of the Bush administration only at the margins .
One could posit a law of political physics : the more peripheral the policy area , the more “ change ” Obama will bring .
Conversely , on the most critical issues — war , the economy , democratic rights — the shifts in policy and personnel will be cosmetic at best .
The continuity from Bush to Obama is symbolized by two of the main appointees : Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of the Treasury - designate Timothy Geithner .
Both played key roles in the Bush administration , and both will play even more important roles in the Obama administration .
Obama postured as the most antiwar of the major candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination , and owed his narrow victory over Hillary Clinton in large measure to the support among youth and students mobilized on the basis of opposition to the war in Iraq .
He has now decided , however , to retain the chief administrator of Bush ’s war policies .
Gates was installed at the Pentagon in December 2006 and oversaw the Bush “ surge ” of 30,000 troops into Iraq , as well as a continuation of the war in Afghanistan .
Geithner is moving up from the number three position in the Bush administration ’s financial bailout squad , where he served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and worked with outgoing Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Geithner ’s reward for the collapse on Wall Street , where he was the chief day - to - day government monitor of the financial markets , is to be promoted to the topmost policy - making position .
The confirmation hearings held so far this month have demonstrated the essential unity of the Democrats and Republicans under conditions of financial and military - political crisis .
Transgressions of the kind that would have invariably derailed a presidential appointment in the last several transitions — failure to pay taxes , employing undocumented immigrants , even involvement in policy debacles and corrupt deal - making — have been swept aside in the interests of swiftly assembling the team to carry out the new president ’s program .
Geithner , for example , will head the department that includes the Internal Revenue Service having failed to pay his payroll taxes over a four - year period , only providing restitution with interest and penalties after he was nominated as treasury secretary .
Attorney General - designate Eric Holder was responsible for implementing the pardon of fugitive billionaire speculator Marc Rich in the last days of the Clinton administration in 2000 .
But after their respective confirmation hearings this week , Republican senators lined up to support both nominees .
Orrin Hatch of Utah , speaking of Geithner , told Fox News , “ He ’s a very , very competent guy . ”
Even more effusive was Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , who called Geithner ’s tax problems “ a lot to do about nothing . ”
He added , “ I just find it to be really unfortunate because here is an extraordinarily qualified guy who we really do want to have in leadership here in Washington . ”
As for Holder , even after a hearing where he flatly declared water boarding to be torture — which could make Bush administration officials legally liable for criminal prosecution at the International Court of Justice in the Hague — Republican senators lined up to support him .
When Holder agreed that the United States is “ at war ” with terrorists , Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina responded , “ I ’m almost ready to vote for you right now . ”
Senator Mel Martinez of Florida issued a written statement declaring , “ Eric Holder understands the unique role of the attorney general and further , I think he ’s qualified to serve in that role …
Therefore , I intend to support Mr. Holder 's confirmation and urge my colleagues to do the same . ”
As for Hillary Clinton , once the highest - profile target for demonization by the Republican right , her confirmation hearing was described in all media accounts as a love fest .
Senators spent 45 minutes praising her before allowing the nominee to read her prepared statement .
Senators who voted to remove her husband from office ten years ago ratified her nomination for secretary of state and sent it to the floor of the Senate where she will be confirmed within minutes of Obama ’s official inauguration .
The only Republican to vote against her nomination , Senator David Vitter of Louisiana , cited potentially corrupt relationships involving fundraising by former president Clinton from foreign governments and individuals , who might use their contributions to provide political leverage with Secretary of State Clinton .
The bipartisan consensus driving the approval of the Obama cabinet was summed up aptly enough in a satirical column by Dana Milbank of the Washington Post , who described Geithner ’s appearance before the Senate Finance Committee under the headline , “ The Nomination That 's Too Big to Fail . ”
Under conditions of a mounting financial crisis which has shocked and frightened the corporate elite , nothing must stand in the way of putting in place the personnel and policies needed to provide an ever - expanding government bailout to Wall Street .
With the economy ever tanking , now is as good a time as any to take stock of where your gay dollars are going .
You may not have much ( or , thanks to prudent investing in gold and shares in Mr. Hobo J. Poverschmidt ’s Hobo Sticks Emporium , you may have quite a bit ) , so why spend it on companies whose executives use their cash to fund anti-gay bills or who refuse their gay employees the same benefits as their straight co-workers ?
With legislators using the economy as an excuse not to move on gay rights bills , we present this list so that you can vote with your dollar and hit homophobic executives where it hurts most .
These are the 10 worst companies for gays and lesbians , chosen for their national influence , prominence , history of corporate bigotry and the likelihood you can do something about it .
Not a single one of them deserves a nickel .
10 . A - 1 Self Storage Company
Owned by Terry Caster , A - 1 is one of California ’s largest storage rental companies , with over 40 locations in the state .
The owner and his family donated $ 693,000 to the Yes on 8 campaign , making then the 2nd largest individual donors to the measure .
Caster defended his donation , telling the San Diego Tribune , “ Without solid marriage , you are going to have a sick society . ”
Since November , three protests against the company have been staged by Californians Against Hate and a boycott is ongoing .
How They ’re Faring :
As a family - owned , private business , there ’s little way to tell how the company is faring and there ’s been no recent business news about A - 1 .
What You Can Do : Activists have set - up a website asking people to boycott the company as well as call the customer support line to voice let them know why they are taking their business elsewhere .
9. AutoZone Inc .
“ America ’s number one retailer of auto parts and accessories ” continues to refuse domestic partner benefits for employees .
AutoZone , a Fortune 500 company , also has a history of being a hostile workforce to women and in 2006 , was sued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
How They ’re Faring : Depends on who you ask .
Shares of AutoZone hit a new 52 - week high Friday , closing at $ 146.39 per share , up $ 3.81 or 2.67 percent for the day , but at least one stock forecaster says AutoZone is ripe for shorting .
What You Can Do : Currently , there is no organized boycott action against AutoZone .
Their customer service number is 1-800-859-3282 .
8. Brown -Forman Corp .
A Fortune 1000 Company , Brown - Forman distributes Jack Daniels , Southern Comfort , Finlandia Vodkas , Herradura Tequila , Sonoma - Cutrer Wines , Fetzer Wines , Korbel Champagne , Bolla Wines , Bonterra Wines , but provides no comfort to its gay and lesbian employees , refusing even basic domestic partner benefits .
How They ’re Faring : B.F. is currently trading at $ 41.70 , up marginally from their mid-November 52 week low of $ 38 dollars , but over the past 10 years has had an average of 8.3 % growth annually .
What You Can Do :
This one makes the list because it ’s so easy for you to make a difference .
Stop drinking the brands Brown - Forman distributes .
If you ’re out at a gay bar and see a bottle of SoCo or Jack Daniels on the shelf ( which you will at just about any gay bar ) , let them know that they ’re serving up their whiskey with a chaser of hate and ask them to consider taking it down off the shelf — though you may want to do this the next day while sober and not while loudly screaming at your bartender .
With so many gay - friendly liquor companies , there ’s no reason to put Brown - Forman booze in your gullet .
UPDATE : Sean Wachsman , P.R. Manager for Southern Comfort writes :
“ I noticed you have included Brown - Forman on this list , so I wanted to provide you with some updated information .
Brown - Forman began offering domestic partner benefits in January 2009 , amended our EEO policy to include gender identity or expression and have created a GLBT Resource Group , among other GLBT efforts .
These changes reflect a genuine desire , on the part of our leadership , to create an inclusive organization .
We hope you will provide this current information to your readers and revise your top 10 list by removing Brown - Forman . ”
7. Cinemark
Regular Queerty readers know our feelings about Cinemark CEO Alan Stock , who donated $ 9,999 dollars to the Yes on 8 campaign .
Operating also under the name Tinseltown , CineArts and Century Theaters , Cinemark delivers the sort of highbrow , artistic films that appeal to gays .
Despite multiple boycotts , including one at Sundance , neither Stock nor Cinemark have pledged to change anything , other than to send out form letters saying , “ It would be inappropriate to influence our employees ’ position on personal issues outside the work environment , especially on political , social or religious activities , ” to people who write asking for Cinemark to take a stand .
How They ’re Faring : Need proof that boycotts are effective ?
Look no further than Cinemark .
While almost all movie chains saw their stock tumble in the October crash , Cinemark has regained little of its value as competitors like Regal Cinemas have shown moderate improvement .
Cinemark now trades at half of what it did in September , hovering at $ 7.99 / share .
What You Can Do : Continue boycotting Cinemark .
Next week , the Supreme Court will hear arguments for and against invalidating Prop.
8 and now ’s as good a time as any to renew your commitment to eat your popcorn in a place that is n’t run by a bigot .
6. Domino ’s Pizza
Another case of CEOs and management using their prominent position and hefty salary to put down gays and lesbians , Domino ’s founder Tom Monaghan is a co-founder of the Thomas More Law Center , which recently defended the San Diego Fire Fighters who won a lawsuit claiming they were sexually harassed by being forced to March in a gay pride parade .
Monaghan also financed a 2001 ballot initiative to remove sexual orientation from Ypsilanti , Michigan ’s , non-discrimination ordinance .
David Brandon , the current CEO , opposes gay marriage and brushed off questions about Domino ’s decision not to extend health benefits to spouses of gay employees when asked about in 2006 saying when he ran for Regent of the University of Michigan , explaining why he does n’t support non-discrimination by saying ,
“ I do n’t understand why we continually have to have discussions about who should and who should n’t be included , in terms of our nondiscrimination policy , because I think identifying specific , special - interest groups or specific entities within the institution almost implies that unless you ’re on that list , then somehow we think you should be treated differently than people who are on that list .
It should not be about lists . ”
How They ’re Faring : So so .
Domino ’s lost about half of its stock value in the crash , but has been steadily gaining traction since and now trades at $ 6.49 / share , down from a 52 - week high of $ 15.33 .
What You Can Do : Weirdly , just about everyone from all sides of the political spectrum have called for a boycott on Domino’s .
Conservatives decry their decision to open a halal - only branch of the pizzeria in the UK and the National Organization of Women boycott the store for the company ’s decision last year to donate $ 50,000 to a pro-life group .
5. Salvation Army
As a church , the Salvation Army is exempt from state anti-gay discrimination laws and the evangelical Christian organization takes advantage of it every chance they get .
The Salvation Army openly says that “ practicing homosexuals ” are n’t welcome in their organization and they have lobbyists in D.C. and abroad who work to prevent gay rights legislation from being enacted .
How They ’re Faring :
One of the other benefits of being a church is that you do n’t have to reveal your financial documents .
What You Can Do : Come Christmas , do n’t drop your nickels in that red kettle , no matter how much Santa Claus tempts you to .
4.Manchester Grand Resorts
Doug Manchester , owner of San Diego ’s Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel , Grand del Mar Resort and Whitetail Club and Resort in Idaho gave $ 125,000 to Yes on Prop 8 campaign .
PlanetOut Inc. , the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , and the Human Rights Campaign all dropped any association with the hotel last year once it was learned that Manchester was using his cash to put Prop. 8 on the ballot .
How They ’re Faring : Another privately owned company , another completely opaque ledger book .
What You Can Do : You can join the ongoing boycott organized by Californians Against Hate .
3. Urban Outfitters ( with one caveat )
As we were putting this list together , we knew Urban Outfitters , whose chairman , Richard Hayne , regularly supports anti-gay legislation and GOP candidates who vote against gay rights , was going to be on the list .
In November , the company quickly removed t- shirts supporting gay marriage from their stores .
However , one small glimmer of change occurred last week when the store announced that the t- shirts were back and that 100 percent of its “ Marriage Equality ” t- shirt sales are going to Equality California and National Center for Lesbian Rights , both major players in the upcoming Supreme Court hearing in California .
How They ’re Faring : Urban Outfitters has lost more than 50 % of its stock value this year , trading now at just over $ 16 .
What You Can Do : A boycott against Urban Outfitters has been going on for years , but the recent t- shirt decision gives gays and lesbians the opportunity to use the carrot as well as the stick .
Write to Urban Outfitters and thank them for their decision to support gay rights organizations .
2. Walmart Stores Inc .
Wal - Mart does not offer domestic partner benefits except in locations required by law .
In addition , while Wal - Mart is the largest retailer of books in the country , it refuses to carry any LGBT - related titles .
In 2008 , after Christian Conservative groups threatened a boycott , Wal - Mart left the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce , with a spokesperson saying the company had decided not “ to support or oppose highly controversial issues . ”
How They ’re Faring : Wal - Mart ’s growth has slowed over the past few years and like all retailers , the company has felt the crunch .
That said , stock - guru and angry man Jim Cramer said Monday , “ Wal - mart is the only retailer I ’m recommending .
I think it ’s terrific , I ’d pull the trigger under $ 46 a share . ”
What You Can Do :
While the conservative threats of boycott forced Wal - Mart to change their limited support for gay and lesbian rights , there ’s been no move by gays and lesbians to boycott in return .
1. ExxonMobil
Rated a 0 by the HRC on gay and lesbian worker ’s rights , ExxonMobil is the largest Fortune 500 company to offer no domestic partner benefits .
In 1999 , when the two companies merged , they eliminated domestic - partner benefits for same - sex partners .
The company also consistently refuses to ban discrimination based on orientation and gender identity , except where required by law .
How They ’re Faring :
While the rest of the economy is tanking , ExxonMobil tankers , laden with liquid gold , have helped the company reap record profits .
On Monday , major brokerage firm Deutsche Bank upgraded Exxon Mobil Corp. from a ‘ hold ’ to a ‘ buy ’ .
What You Can Do : Take public transportation to work .
You ’ll not only be hurting big oil ’s anti-gay employment practices , you ’ll be helping the environment as well .
What do you think about boycotts ?
We ’d love to hear about your own personal financial decisions and if you ever choose to shop elsewhere because of a company ’s policies .
Let us know about it in the comments .
In today 's Wall Street Journal Tax Report :
The IRS 's Chief Counsel will leave next month to join Sullivan & Cromwell .
Don Korb , IRS chief counsel for more than 4 ½ years , will become a partner of the law firm and head of its " tax controversy " practice .
The IRS chief counsel 's post is one of the most important -- and highly coveted -- tax jobs in Washington .
A successor has not been named .
Mr. Korb , who will be based in Washington , says he will join the New York - based firm early next month .
A formal announcement is expected soon .
... Mr. Korb , 60 years old , previously had said he would be leaving the IRS before Jan. 20 but had n't disclosed publicly where he would be going .
Writing about gay marriage and the vote in California Hertzberg says , quote , “ Like a polluted swamp , anti-gay bigotry is likely to get thicker and more toxic as it dries up … .
Newt Gingrich , the former House Speaker , said the other day ( on the air , to Bill O’Reilly ) , “ I think are is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us … .
” Now just O’Reilly ’s face on the screen :
What Hertzberg did not tell New Yorker readers is that that conversation with Speaker Gingrich was about gay violence against a Christian missionary in San Francisco .
It had nothing to do with the gay marriage vote , only militant reaction to it .
Hertzberg does this kind of dishonest stuff all the time , because he knows many of his readers never watch “ The Factor ” and Gingrich and I are easy targets for his distortions .
Hertzberg owes Newt Gingrich a written apology for taking his remarks completely out of context .
And The New Yorker magazine should be ashamed to publish a dishonest guy like this .
End of segment .
After modestly accepting congratulations from several colleagues ( and some ribbing from David Remnick , our editor ) , I went to my office as usual .
The next day , Wednesday , Remnick got an e-mail from one of O’Reilly ’s producers , Ron Mitchell .
Can you bear to read the whole thing ?
I have contacted Alexa Cassanos about this , but also wanted to send this directly to you .
Bill O’Reilly has taken issue with certain statements that appeared in Mr. Hertzberg ’s piece from your December 1st issue .
Mr. Hertzberg , who recounts a recent installment of The O’Reilly Factor , has accused former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of being an anti-gay “ bigot ” while ignoring the context of the conversation between Speaker Gingrich and Mr. O’Reilly .
It seems unlikely that Mr. Hertzberg actually saw the show , but relied upon 2nd hand accounts of that conversation .
I have included a timeline and transcript of what happened .
It is clear that Speaker Gingrich is referring to several well - publicized accounts of gay marriage proponents engaged in activities such as storming a church in Michigan and assaulting a Christian group in San Francisco .
He is not referring to an entire group of people .
We believe that Mr. Hertzberg owes Speaker Gingrich an apology and are asking for a statement from you on this matter .
I am sure that you will agree that a serious allegation like this deserves your immediate attention .
We ’re still in Mitchell ’s e-mail .
There ’s more — his “ timeline and transcript ” :
1 - On the November 14 edition of The O’Reilly Factor , the following exchange happened between O’Reilly and Newt Gingrich : > > O’REILLY : .he did n’t have the power that she has .
And he did n’t have a husband or a wife like he does .
OK , now the culture war , I know you ’ve been flying around the country and doing stuff .
In the last three or four days , really nasty stuff .
I mean , you know , hyper .
We ’re going to show you some of the video .
A woman getting a cross smashed out of her hand .
We had a church in Michigan invaded by gay activists .
We ’re going to show you the video on Monday of that .
We have exclusively .
We had a guy in Sacramento fired from his job .
We have boycotts called on restaurants .
I mean , it is getting out of control very few days after the election .
How do you assess that ?
GINGRICH : Look , I think there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants impose its will on the rest of us .
It is prepared to use violence , to use harassment .
I think it is prepared to use the government , if it can get control of it .
I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion .
And I think if you believe in historic Christianity , you have to confront the fact , and frankly for that matter if you believe in the historic version of Islam or the historic version of Judaism , you have to confront the reality that the secular extremists are determined to impose on you acceptance of a series of values that are antithetical , they ’re the opposite of what you ’re taught in Sunday school . >

Gingrich : “ [ T ] here is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us ” Summary : Discussing actions by individual protesters of Proposition 8 , Newt Gingrich stated : “ I think there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us , is prepared to use violence , to use harassment .
I think it is prepared to use the government if it can get control of it .
I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion . ” >
3 - In the December 1 issue of The New Yorker , Hendrick Hertzberg wrote this in his piece ( p.27 ) : > >
Like a polluted swamp , anti-gay bigotry is likely to get thicker and more toxic as it dries up .
Viciousness meets viscousness .
“ Look , ” Newt Gingrich , the former House Speaker , said the other day ( on the air , to Bill O’Reilly ) , “ I think there is a gay and secular fascism in this country that wants to impose its will on the rest of us , is prepared to use violence … .
I think that it is a very dangerous threat to anybody who believes in traditional religion .
And I think if you believe in historic Christianity , you have to confront the fact . ”
For diversity ’s sake , he added that “ the historic version of Islam ” and “ the historic version of Judaism ” are likewise menaced — which is natural , given that gay , secular , fascist values are “ the opposite of what you ’re taught in Sunday school . ”
This sort of sludge may or may not prove to be of some slight utility in the 2012 Republican primaries , but it is , increasingly , history . >

Senior Producer , The O’Reilly Factor
Fox News ChannelRemnick ’s reply , later that day :
Dear Mr. Mitchell ,
Thank you for your email .
I ’ve read your note carefully , and more than once , and , of course , have read Hendrik Hertzberg ’s piece again .
It ’s simple : I stand behind , and with , Mr. Hertzberg ; that is , as the editor of the magazine , I have no problem with the piece he wrote .
Any other back - and - forth would likely be more productive with him .
Respectfully yours ,
DavidThat evening , the Wednesday , December 3rd , edition of “ The O’Reilly Factor ” came and went with no video of me and the guy with the microphone .
That seemed to be that .
Then , at about half past midnight last night ( i.e. , shortly after Wednesday became Thursday ) , I checked my e-mail one last time and found this , sent a couple of hours earlier by someone called Steve :
Subj : Do n’t Lie in your editorials Dude !
When the gays and dykes crash into churches to impose their idealogy violently on average americans and destroy signs of opposing views , that ’s fascism !!!
Get your facts right before you spout propaganda !!
Gathering from this that O’Reilly had found some usable footage after all , I turned on the TV .
Luckily , his program is rebroadcast from midnight to 1 A.M.
Sure enough :
Now that Barack Obama has won the election , his longtime supporter Will .
I. Am is premiering the video for his new song " It 's a New Day . "
The Black Eyed Pea spent some time in a New York City studio recording his third ode to the president - elect .
Will stopped by " Oprah " on Friday to debut the new celeb - filled video for the track , and is also posting the clip to the site Dipdive .
The video flashes pictures of Obama on election night and crowds celebrating the Illinois senator 's victory , alongside images of historical figures like Abraham Lincoln and Harriet Tubman .
And it would n't be a Will .
I. Am video without some celebrity appearances .
This time around , he 's rounded up his bandmate Fergie , as well as actors Olivia Wilde , Jonathan Schaech and Kerry Washington .
" It was a beautiful thing , " he told Oprah of spending election night in Chicago .
He also could n't find the words to describe how excited he is for Obama 's win .
" I can't really explain it , " he said .
" I think of my grandma .
I think of all the people who paved the way for that moment ... like the invisibles who pushed the movement forward . "
When he released his first song about the then presidential hopeful , " Yes We Can , " Will gathered celebrity friends including John Legend , Scarlett Johansson and Common for the video .
The next song , " We Are the Ones , " also had a star - filled video , this one featuring George Lopez and Jessica Alba .
There is nobody so irritating as somebody with less intelligence and more sense than we have .

( CNN ) -- Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens , the Republican lawmaker convicted on felony corruption charges in October , officially conceded the Senate race to Democrat Mark Begich on Wednesday .
" Given the number of ballots that remain to be counted , it is apparent the election has been decided and Mayor Begich has been elected , " Stevens said in a news release .
" It was a tough fight that would not have been possible without the help of so many Alaskans -- people who I am honored to call my friends .
... I wish Mayor Begich and his family well .
My staff and I stand willing to help him prepare for his new position , " he added .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin also congratulated Begich on Wednesday .
" I extend my congratulations to Mark Begich and his family .
This is a new era for Alaska , and I look forward to working with Mark on the many issues that are important to our state .
I am confident he will add a compelling new voice to the U.S. Senate , " Palin said in a statement .
Palin praised Stevens , saying his " tireless efforts on behalf of the state he loves have benefited all those who call it home . "
With 100 percent of Alaska 's precincts reporting , Begich , the mayor of Anchorage , had roughly 48 percent of the vote , compared with about 47 percent for Stevens , according to CNN 's latest tally .
He bested Stevens by 3,724 votes .
Alaska Elections Director Gail Fenumiai said that 2,500 overseas ballots remain to be counted .
The full results will be certified during the week of December 1 .
A recount could take place , however , if the vote difference between Begich and Stevens is less than 0.5 percent .
Stevens could have also asked for a recount , regardless of the difference , if he pays for it himself .
The results of this race have national implications as Democrats seek a filibuster - proof 60 - member majority in the Senate .
With Begich 's win , they hold 58 seats ; races in Minnesota and Georgia are still unresolved .
Stevens , who turned 85 on Tuesday , was convicted in October of filing false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms .
Prosecutors said Stevens hid hundreds of thousands of dollars in " freebies " from an oil - field services company in his home state .
On Tuesday , his fellow Senate Republicans postponed a vote on whether to kick Stevens out of their caucus pending the final vote results .
Stevens maintained his innocence even after the conviction .
At a debate days before the election , he said he had " not been convicted of anything . "
In his statement claiming victory , Begich said he was " humbled and honored " by the apparent results .
" It 's been an incredible journey getting to this point , and I appreciate the support and commitment of the thousands of Alaskans who have brought us to this day , " he said in the statement .
" I can't wait to get to work fighting for Alaskan families . "
CNN political producer Ed Hornick contributed to this report .

Affordable , Powerful Electric Scooters Coming Soon
September 2nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
VentureBeat reports that PowerGenix has developed a nickel zinc ( NiZn ) battery that has 35 percent higher power and energy density than a nickel metal hydride ( NiMH ) battery ( used in hybrid vehicles ) , but is half the cost of a lithium - ion battery .
This is great news for scooter fanatics , who right now are forced to choose between cheap scooters with lead - acid batteries and expensive scooters with powerful lithium - ion batteries .
A bike or scooter using the PowerGenix ’ NiZn battery has enough energy to run errands or commute to work — but comes with a cheaper price tag than the lithium - ion powered Zero .
PowerGenix recently inked a deal with Veloteq to produce scooters using their NiZn battery .
Look for the scooters to be marketed initially in Europe and the US next year .

An anti-war protester carries the Israeli flag Photo by Rachel Avnery , Gush Shalom
Some 10,000 Israelis took part in a huge anti-war march , a one - mile procession from Rabin Square to Cinematheque Square in the heart of Tel Aviv last night at the same time that the Israeli military began a bloody ground offensive in Gaza .
Organisers were surprised at the turnout as only a thousand had taken part in a similar rally the last time the Israeli military launched a ground offensive against Lebanon .
Last night ’s anti-war protest was organised by about 20 Israeli groups including the Women ’s Coalition for Peace , Anarchists Against the Wall , Gush Shalom , Hadash , the Alternative Information Centre and New Profile .
About a thousand Arab Israelis joined in .
Protesters carried a giant banner , which read in Hebrew , Arabic and English : “ Stop Killing !
Stop the Siege !
Stop the occupation ! ”
The peace marchers were later harassed by reactionary right wing forces , according to a report by Gush Shalom :
“ One does not build an election campaign over the dead bodies of children ! ” shouted the protesters in Hebrew rhymes .
“ Orphans and widows are not election propaganda ! ” , “ Olmert , Livni and Barak – war is no game ! ” “ All cabinet ministers are war criminals ! ! ”
“ Barak , Barak , do n’t worry – we shall meet you in The Hague ! ” , “ Enough , enough – speak with Hamas ! ”
The written posters were similar .
Some of them paraphrased Barak ’s election slogans : “ Barak is not friendly , he is a murderer ! ” ( The original Barak slogan says : “ Barak is not friendly , he is a leader ! ” )
Also : “ No to the Election War , 2009 ! ” and “ The six - Knesset - seat war ! ” – an allusion to the polls which showed that in the first days of the war Barak ’s Labor Party has gained six prospective seats … .
On the day of the protest , the extreme Right mobilized their forces in order to break up the demonstration by force .
The police made a great effort to prevent riots , and the one - mile march from Rabin Square to Cinematheque Square proceeded relatively quietly .
However , when the protesters started to disperse , in accordance with the agreement with the police , a large crowd of rightists started to attack them .
The police , which till then had been keeping the two camps apart , disappeared from the scene .
The rioters then encircled the last of the protesters , harassing them , pushing them about and at a certain point started to besiege the Cinematheque building , where some of the last protesters had found refuge .
They tried to break into the building , threatening to “ finish off ” the protesters , but at the last moment some police arrived and protected the entrance .
The rioters stayed around for a long time .
Let us pray for liberty to the oppressed , for consolation for victims of violence and aggresssion , and for strength and perseverance to the peace - makers .

03:19 pm - Buffered async IO
We have this infrastructure in the kernel for doing asynchronous IO , which sits in fs / aio.c and fs/ direct - io.c mainly .
It works fine and it 's pretty fast .
From userspace you would link with - laio and use the functions there for hooking into the syscalls .
However , it 's only really async for direct uncached IO ( files opened with O_DIRECT ) .
This last little detail essentially means that it 's largely useless to most people .
Oracle uses it , and other databases may as well .
But nobody uses aio on the desktop or elsewhere simply because it is n't a good fit when O_DIRECT is required - you then need aligned IO buffers and transfer sizes and you lose readahead .
The alignment and size restrictions also make it difficult to convert existing apps to use libaio with O_DIRECT , since it requires more than just a straight forward conversion .
It adds complexity .
Over the years , several alternative approaches to async IO have been proposed / developed .
We 've had several variants of uatom / syslet / fibril / threadlet type schemes , which all boil down to ( just about ) the same type of implementation - when a process is about to block inside the kernel , a cloned process / thread returns to userspace on behalf of the original process and informs it of the postponed work .
The completed events can then later be retrieved through some sort of get_event / wait_event type interface , similar to how you reap completions with other types of async IO .
Or the implementation provided a callback type scheme , similar to how eg a signal would be received in the process .
This sort of setup performed acceptably , but suffered from the schizophrenic disorder of split personalities due to the change in personalities on return from the kernel .
Various approaches to " fix " or alleviate this problem were n't particularly pretty .
Recently , Zach Brown started playing with something he calls acall .
The user interface is pretty neat , and ( like the above syslet etc like implementations ) , it allows for performing all system calls in an async nature .
Zach took a more simplified approach for making it async in the kernel , by punting every operation to a thread in the kernel .
This obviously works and means that the submission interface is very fast , which is of course a good thing .
It also means that some operations are going to be performed by someone else than the process that requested the operation , which has implications for IO scheduling in the system .
Advanced IO schedulers like CFQ tracks IOs on a per-process basis , and they then need the specific process context for both performance and accounting reasons .
Last year I added a CLONE_IO flag for sharing the IO context across processes for situations like this , so this part is actually easily fixable by just using that clone flag for creation of the kernel worker thread .
Obviously , doing a fork ( ) like operation for every async system call is n't going to scale , so some sort of thread pooling must be put in place for speeding it up .
Not sure what Zach has done there yet ( I do n't think a version with that feature has been released yet ) , but even with that in place there 's still going to be identity fiddling when a thread is taking over work from a user space process .
Apart from the overhead of juggling these threads , there 's also going to be a substantial increase in context switch rates with this type of setup .
And this last bit is mostly why I do n't think the acall approach will end up performing acceptably for doing lots of IO , while it does seem to be quite nice for the more casual async system call requirements .
A third and final possibility also exists , and this is what I have been trying to beat into submission lately .
Back in the very early 2.6 kernel days , Suparna Bhattacharya led an effort to add support for buffered IO to the normal fs / aio .c submission path .
The patches sat in Andrews - mm tree for some time , before they eventually got dropped due to Andrew spending too much time massaging them into every - mm release .
They work by replacing the lock_page ( ) call done for waiting IO completion to a page with another helper function - I call it lock_page_async ( ) in the current patches .
If the page is still locked when this function is called , we return - EIOCBRETRY to the caller , informing him that he should retry this call later on .
When a process in the kernel wants to wait for some type of event , a wait queue is supplied .
When that event occurs , the other end does a wake up call on that wait queue .
This last operation invokes a callback in the wait queue , which normally just does a wake_up_process ( ) like call to wake the process blocked for this event .
With the async page waiting , we simply provide our own wait queue in the process structure and the callback given from fs / aio . c then merely adds the completed event to the aio ringbuffer associated with the IO context for that IO and process .
This last approach means that we have to replace the lock_page ( ) calls in the IO path with lock_page_async ( ) and be able to handle an " error " return from that function .
But apart from that , things generally just work .
The original process is still the one that does the IO submission , thus we do n't have to play tricks with identity thefts or pay the large context switch fee for each IO .
We also get readahead .
In other words , it works just like you expect buffered IO to work .
Additionally , the existing libaio interface works for this as well .
Currently my diffstat looks like this :
19 files changed , 445 insertions (+ ) , 153 deletions (-)
for adding support for the infrastructure , buffered async reads , and buffered async writes for ext2 and ext3 .
That is n't bad , imho .
Initial performance testing looks encouraging .
I 'll be back with more numbers and details , as progress and time permits !
Mom and Dad Frog Decide to Have Baby Frogs
Diagram of the Frog Life Cycle Diagram of the Frog Life Cycle
The life cycle of a frog starts when mom and dad frog fall in love and decide to have baby frogs .
Okay , nobody really knows if frogs fall in love , but it 's okay to think that they do .
Mom and dad frog will mate , either in the water or in a tree , depending on what kind of frogs they are .
You know this is happening when you see dad frog hugging mom frog from behind her .
The dad frog will lay on top of mom frog and wrap his front legs around her body and he will hug her for several days .
This hug is called amplexus .
Spawning
While mom and dad frog are hugging , mom frog will lay a bunch of eggs for the dad frog to fertilize .
Unlike human eggs , frog eggs are fertilized by dad frog when they are outside of the mom frog 's body .
This is called spawning and is the very beginning of the frog life cycle .
After the mom and dad frog have finished spawning , dad frog leaves , and sometimes the mom frog does , too .
Sometimes mom frog will stick around , though , and wait for the baby frogs to hatch so that she can care for them , but this only happens with some breeds of frogs , not all of them .
The Frog Eggs
Frog Eggs Frog Eggs
Mom frog will lay a whole bunch of eggs because most of them wo n't hatch .
Some of the eggs will be eaten by other small animals and birds , and some of them wo n't become fertilized .
Other eggs might become dried up in the sun or get broken in the water .
The eggs that survive will hatch after about 7 to 9 days and begin the frog cycle and start the many life stages of a frog .
But they do n't get to be frogs just yet ; they have to go through the tadpoles ' life cycle first .
The Tadpole When frog eggs hatch they do n't come out as frogs right away , they have to start out as tiny little fish - like creatures called tadpoles .
In the beginning 7 days or so of tadpole development , a tadpole will eat the egg yolk that is still left in its gut .
The only parts to the baby tadpole are the gills , the tail , and the mouth .
After about 7 days of tadpole development , the tadpole will begin to swim around on its own and eat algae from the top of the water .
Tadpole Development
About four weeks into the tadpoles life cycle it will begin to grow teeth and skin over the gills and will begin to become social and swim in schools like fish .
Then 6 to 9 weeks into the tadpoles development it will begin to grow longer and develop a little bit of a head and some legs .
At the end of the 9 weeks , the tadpole will look more like a frog than a fish , but with a long tail .
The tadpole will also start to eat things like tiny insects .
In areas of the world that have cold winter months or that are in very high altitudes , which also are sometimes very cold places , the tadpoles life cycle takes all winter long to complete .
Frog Metamorphosis
Diagram of the Frog Life Cycle Diagram of the Frog Life Cycle From 9 to about 12 weeks , the frog metamorphosis starts to really take shape .
The tadpole that looks like an itty bitty frog but with a long tail ( called a Froglet ) will lose most of its tail , grow a frog tongue , and start to really look like a baby frog .
The whole frog life cycle model is completed after about 16 weeks when the frog becomes an adult .
Diagram of Frog Life Cycle
If you wanted to draw a diagram of frog life cycle , you might make it look like a circle , starting with eggs , and then the baby tadpole .
Then you would add legs to the baby tadpole and call that a ' Froglet ' .
Then draw a full grown frog , which points back to the eggs because the life cycle of a frog does n't end with the full grown frog .
The full grown frog will find a frog to love and to make more baby frogs with and begin the frog life cycle all over again .
What 's the difference in a toad and frog life cycle ?
Actually , toads are frogs .
Toads are just called something different because they look a little different , but they are all part of the frog family .
Lots of people want to know what the difference is between a toad life cycle and a frog life cycle .
Mostly it 's the way that the eggs are laid and the way that the skin develops .
The frog eggs are laid in clumps and toad eggs are laid out in strands or lines .
The skin of a frog will develop into slimy skin and the skin of a toad will develop into warty skin , which is why people think that toads can give you warts .
But if toads can give you warts , why do n't frogs make you slimy ?
Grow a Frog
Giant Bullfrog Tadpoles Giant Bullfrog Tadpoles
So , if you were going to grow a frog , where would you start ?
Would you start with a tadpole or with an egg ?
I bet you said egg .
But remember that most of the eggs wo n’t live , so how do you know that you have a living egg ?
Maybe starting with a tadpole would give you better luck when you are trying to grow a frog .
Or , maybe you should start with a mom and a dad frog .
But then you might grow a hundred frogs and they would take over your whole room and turn your walls green and sing you to sleep every night croaking …
Okay , that ’s another story !
Start with a tadpole and you will be able to watch the whole , very cool , frog metamorphosis .

Two police officers look for pictures of knives
Hundreds of weapons have been taken off the streets of Glasgow six months after police started using the web to crack down on gang violence .
Young trainee officers at Strathclyde Police search social networking sites for pictures of people posing with weapons , mainly knives .
Constable Holly McGee and Cadet Fraser Reed , both 18 , carry out the work .
" We 're looking for anyone who is brandishing offensive weapons or blades , " Holly told Newsbeat .
" We take the date , the time , detail of what 's in the photograph , [ then ] a copy of the photograph is printed out and thereafter it's all sent to the gangs task force unit . "
That 's when more experienced officers in the Violence Reduction Unit at Strathclyde Police get involved .
' The law 's been broken '
The man in charge of this , Superintendent Bob Hamilton , says there are two ways of dealing with people once they 've been tracked down .
If they were posing in a public place , like on the street or a park , the law has been broken and they 'll be arrested .
Even when pictures are taken in private , though , which is n't technically breaking the law , he says the weapons are so dangerous his officers pay a visit to the people involved .
We have large kitchen knives , axes , samurai swords , baseball bats , a huge number and different type of weapons
Superintendent Bob Hamilton
" We show the parents their pictures , " he explained , " recover the weapons and make sure they know that behaviour is unacceptable .
" We have large kitchen knives , axes , samurai swords , baseball bats , a huge number and different type of weapons - in simple terms weapons that can kill . "
Superintendent Hamilton says Operation Access has been a complete success .
" We 've questioned more than 400 people , most of them teenagers , as part of it and it's worked so well it will carry on indefinitely , " he said .
Other forces from across the UK have also been in touch about the possibility of setting up similar operations .
Social networking sites Facebook and Bebo both say they 're committed to improving safety for their members as well as helping cut crime .

The wrong question .
" Dear Alone : I read your descriptions of narcissism , and it sounds exactly like me .
I 'm terrified I 'm a narcissist .
It 's just like you wrote : unlike other people , I can't seem to make meaningful connections with people , and when I try it indeed seems unreal , scripted .
Other people seem to have legitimate emotions , be happy , or in love , or angry , or guilty , and to me it always seems like I 'm -- just a little bit -- faking it .
" Narcissism says : my situation is different .
I am not like other people , who are merely automatons , shuffling towards oblivion .
" Why are you so obsessed with narcissism ?
" Describe the march of history over the past 100 years .
Answer : Fascism , then Marxism , then Narcissism .
What distinguishes the three ?
Technology .
What followed fascism ?
War .
What followed Marxism ?
War .
" But I want to change , I want to get better .
" Narcissism says :.
NeverNo one ever asks me , ever , " I think I 'm a narcissist , and I 'm worried I 'm hurting my family . "
No one ever asks me , " I think I 'm too controlling , I 'm trying to subtly manipulate my girlfriend not to notice other people 's qualities . "
No one ever , ever , ever asks me , " I am often consumed by irrational rage , I am unable to feel guilt , only shame , and when I am caught , found out , exposed , I try to break down those around me so they feel worse than I do , so they are too miserable to look down on me .
"
If that was what they asked , I would tell them them change is within grasp .
But .
" So all is lost ?
" Describe yourself : your traits , qualities , both good and bad .
Do not use the word " am . " Practice this .
Instead of asking , " why do I feel disconnected ? " ask the reverse question : " what would I feel if I was n't disconnected ? "
Be specific , say the answer out loud .
Go ahead , take some time , think about it .
What does connecting feel like ?
I 'll wait .
Let me guess : you have no idea .
All you have for an answer is images , fleeting thoughts .
Nothing concrete .
Some words , some phrases , bits and pieces of conversations you may have heard or that you daydreamed .
Now ask yourself , where did you get these images and phrases ?
Imagine two people : real , or from TV or movies , that are in love .
Pick two people whose love you 'd like to emulate .
Imagine them kissing , looking into each other 's eyes .
Imagine them making love .
You wish you had a love like that , but you do n't , and every time you try , to get it , it is failure .
Here 's the reason : are you imaging real people , or TV characters ?
The 1980s said : " TV is a bad influence , pushing our children down the wrong path . "
Of course , it 's Newton 's First Law : a body moves in the direction of the force unless it is opposed by another force .
Where will they learn about love ?
They could learn from TV , or they could learn it from the generation adults with the highest divorce rates in history .
They could learn about the difficulties of raising kids from an ABC / Disney Special , or from the generation with the lowest birth rates in history .
They could learn about morality from , or ... but Dad always remembered to send in his pledge to PBS .
Parents had no time for any of these lessons .
So instead , to feel like parents , they worried that too much sex on TV would turn everyone into sluts .
That did n't happen , I spent most of my twenties checking .
What did happen , however , is that a generation of males started overtly , without shame , craving sluts , and a generation of women would often pretend to be sluts .
Think about this : the act was that they were sluttier than they actually were , not more pure than they actually were .
Parents were right : TV could influence kids .
But not in the expected way .
But wait -- could TV be so powerful ?
No , of course not .
But how much force do you really need to push a child in a polyester snow suit across a frozen driveway ?
People ask : " why do you focus on pop culture ? "
Because that 's all the culture 300 million Americans ever received for 30 + years .
Imprinting was famously depicted by Konrad Lorenz who had a gaggle of geese following him , behaving like him , in love with him .
Less famously known : it took him only 48 hours to alter their identity .
And without the use of TV .
So now what ?
TV taught you how to love , it showed you what love looks like , feels like .
But when you 're actually in love , it does n't look like that , so you secretly suspect you do n't have the capacity for love , that there 's something wrong with you .
Same goes for sadness .
And it 's worse when you 're in the presence of someone else 's sadness , you have no idea what to do .
All you really know about experiencing these emotions is the script you got from TV . ! "
But you do n't feel any of that .
Nothing .
So you think to yourself , what the hell is wrong with me ?
This woman 's husband died -- sure , I can fake it , but am I such an empty monster that I feel nothing ?
Of course you feel nothing .
Why would you ?-- it 's not your loss .
What 's wrong is n't your lack of feeling , but that you think you have to feel something , that you have to tell this woman , remind this woman , how horrible is her loss .
You think the only way to connect with people is to have their emotions .
You think she wants to connect with .
You think she wants your help .
The problem is n't your lack of feeling , it is that you think that unlessfeel it 's not real .
You forget that she has a life that does n't have you in it .
What you should say is , " I 'm very sorry to hear that .
Is there anything I can do ? " and .
But that feels insufficient .
You think this because you think that there is something youdo , that the sadness is not real for you so it must not be real for her and you thus have the power to change it .
She 's not looking for you to be sad , she 's not looking to you for anything , her loss is bigger than you .
If she needs anything from you , it 's sympathy , not empathy .
But no one taught you this .
So you fall back on the " man helping grieving widow . "
Action !
The problem is n't that you do n't know how to connect ; it 's that when you do connect at all , you do n't know what to do next .
It 's your unrealistic expectations of what connecting is supposed to be .
TV is always about beginnings , not middles .
Like love .
The love you feel does n't resemble the TV love because the TV love is the first three days of love , copied and pasted into a decade of episodes .
But since you have no other reference point , after a real decade , you think , " I guess must not be in love anymore .
"
You are so unsure of your own identity that you do n't know if you are supposed to be feeling , what you are supposed to be feeling , when you are supposed to be feeling .
This is the same trouble actors have when rehearsing a character .
They want to get it just perfect -- would Tom feel this ?
What 's his motivation ?
And similarly you ask : would I -- the person I am pretending to be -- feel this ?
Narcissism is imitating by being .
It is method acting all the time .
The problem was n't TV , the problem was the absence of adults , real adults who took seriously their responsibility to the next generation , who lead not by words , but by behavior .
Who , even if miserable or unfulfilled or unconnected had the decency to fake itthe next generation , for the people they touched .
Who did n't cheat on their wives not just because they loved them , not just because it was ethically wrong , but becauseI know , everyone will disagree .
Everyone , except daughters under 20 .
I killed a mosquito yesterday , because it bit me and it hurt and I am not the Dali Lama .
The narcissist , however , says , " It 's just a bug . "
" I feel like I am playing a part , that I 'm in a role .
It does n't feel real .
" Instead of trying to stop playing a role -- again , -- try playing a different role whose aim is someone else 's happiness .
Why not play the part of the happy husband of three kids ?
Why not pretend to be devoted to your family to the exclusion of other things ?
Why not play the part of the man who is n't tempted to sleep with the woman at the airport bar ?
" But that 's dishonest , I 'd be lying to myself . "
Your kids will not know to ask : so ?
The narcissist demands absolutism in all things -- relative to himself .
" But I had really good parents !
" Sorry , Leonidas , you were simply outnumbered .
The best of parents can't beat the overwhelming influence of everyone else , of everyone else 's parents , of TV , of journalism -- of a culture that says , " well of course !
The old ideas were wrong , we know so much more now !
We are touching up the last pages of history , from now on things are different ... " 18 years of the best parenting still can't beat the morality lesson at the end of an 80s sitcom , presented as if it were a fundamental truth , known to all , incontrovertible .
So what about the next generation , those under 25 ?
If the problem was the unopposed influence of TV -- not the TV , per se , but the lack of opposing influence -- then the solution is some opposing influence .
I am nervous about recommending " the Classics " because it sounds contrived and pretentious , but anything that has withstood the test of time and is not something that was created to be consumed by current narcissist adults is as good a place to start as any .
Do the opposite of what the narcissists did .
They wanted to know enough to fake it .
They read just enough to use the book to build an identity , so they readbooks , but not the actual books .
If nothing else , reading will keep you out of trouble : every moment reading those books is a moment not doing something your current adults created for themselves that you 're stuck with by default .
" Why do you waste your time with pop culture ? "
Because you may not be interested in pop culture , but pop culture is interested in you .

Live Free Or Die Hard director Len Wiseman is helming the Gears movie and co-writing it with Fast & Furious scribe Chris Morgan .
And yes , Wiseman is not a gamer , but a grabber .

Admitting that he " sucks " at video games , Wiseman ( pictured , with friend ) happened on Gears when he was asked to select a video game to appear the background of a scene while making Live Free or Die Hard .
" I said ' this one looks really , really cool whatever it is , ' and it was Gears Of War , " explains Wiseman .
" I just really connected with it ; the design of it the world , the whole thing .
So I actually brought an Xbox 360 to start researching what it was . "
Wiseman says he 's more of a sci- fi fan and less of a horror one and will focus more on the science fiction element .
That being said , he added he hopes to make Gears of War like The Lord of the Rings fantasy films .

" The hope is that were wanting to do a three movies and really cover the bases on everything , " says Wiseman .
" Basically a harder edged Lord Of The Rings . "
A trilogy ?
More sci-fi ?

For years , Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) has been pressing for legislation that would require Internet Service Providers to retain user data in order to aid law enforcement in hunting down child porn peddlers and downloaders .
Last week , he introduced his most recent effort , and today was joined at a press conference in Austin by Sen.
John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , who sponsored the Senate 's companion bill , to make the case for the 2009 edition of the Internet Safety Act .
Smith is hardly the only member of Congress enthusiastic about Internet regulation aimed at protecting children : a 2008 analysis produced jointly by the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Progress and Freedom Foundation counted 30 such bills introduced in a single year .
But he is one of the more persistent .
Language requiring ISPs to preserve user data for two years — as this most recent bill would — first appeared in the ambitious Child Pornography and Obscenity Prevention Act of 2002 , which passed the House by an overwhelming margin but stalled in the Senate .
A series of subsequent attempts — most recently the Internet SAFETY Act ( that 's " Stop Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Youth " ) — have all died in committee .
Many of the earlier bills , however , were far broader in scope , packed with provisions that drew objections that would n't be applicable to the narrower legislation introduced last week .
The 2002 proposal , for example , earned the ire of the American Civil Liberties Union due to constitutionally dubious language banning " virtual " child porn ( made without actual children ) and the presentation of adult porn as though it depicted minors ( i.e. 40 - year - old actresses in pigtails and high school cheerleading outfits ) .
The 2007 version of the SAFETY
Act was far narrower and more similar to the present bill , but also included a provision requiring commercial sites containing " sexually explicit " material to include government - approved watermarks .
It established penalties for ISPs that fail to report child porn when they discover it — language that might have placed providers in the awkward position of trying to gauge the ages of actors in online porn .
The data retention provision of that legislation was also more broadly worded , tasking the Attorney General with developing regulations that " shall , at a minimum , require retention of records , such as the name and address of the subscriber or registered user to whom an Internet Protocol address , user identification or telephone number was assigned , in order to permit compliance with court orders that may require production of such information . "
Most of that gone is in the current proposal .
A press release on Cornyn 's site implicitly touts the exclusion of the reporting requirement as a feature by emphasizing that the bill will " target those who deliberately endanger our children — not those internet service providers who work with law enforcement to protect them . "
The retention language is also somewhat more narrowly tailored : ISPs must " retain for a period of at least two years all records or other information pertaining to the identity of a user of a temporarily assigned network address the service assigns to that user . "
It sounds as though the intent is just to require them to keep a record of which subscriber account was assigned a dynamic IP address at a particular time — though there 's certainly some ambiguity there as well .
If many people share a single connection , an e-mail sent from a particular account might arguably be " information pertaining to the identity " of the specific user .
But it 's also clearly less vague and potentially overbroad than the parallel language in predecessor bills .
That does n't mean objectors have fallen silent .
CDT 's Greg Nojeim calls the data retention language " invasive , risky , unnecessary , and likely to be ineffective . "
The bill 's sponsors , of course , argue that it is necessary .
" Federal , state and local law enforcement officials have reached a digital dead end in their battle against the online sexual exploitation of children , " Cornyn claimed at Thursday 's press conference .
" Investigators need the assistance of Internet Service Providers to identify users and distributors of online child pornography . "
But Nojeim questions that assertion , saying that law enforcement " has adequate authority now to require providers to preserve the records it needs . "
Though many ISPs discard user records after a few months , they must keep data if they 're informed by police that a particular user is under investigation .
And of course , if data is retained for all users , rather than only those who 've already caught the eye of the kiddie porn cops , it may prove useful for purposes utterly unrelated to porn prosecutions — identifying purported copyright infringers springs readily to mind .
In addition to the data retention requirement , the bill increases penalties for those found guilty of trafficking in child porn — up to a maximum of life in prison — and allocates $ 30 million to fund the FBI 's " Innocent Images " initiative .
The Alameda County District Attorney 's Office said it filed murder charges against a former Bay Area transit officer in the shooting death of an unarmed black man .
District Attorney Tom Orloff said the murder charge was filed against 27 - year - old Johannes Mehserle because the evidence indicates " an unlawful killing done by an intentional act " and that there was no evidence available yet that could " mitigate " that .
Oakland police said Wednesday that Mehserle was arrested in Douglas County , Nevada on Tuesday in connection with the shooting of Oscar Grant III at the Fruitvale BART station in Oakland on Jan .
1 .
Officers said Mehserle waived an extradition hearing in Nevada , and is being transported to the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin .
" This investigation shows that no one is above the law , but everyone is entitled to due process of the law , " said BART Board President Thomas Blalock said .
" BART investigated this shooting thoroughly and treated the investigation and information no differently because the suspect involved was a police officer .
Now we have to let due process take its course . "
Orloff said Mehserle could be arraigned as early as Thursday .
Nevada authorities arrested Mehserle after learning the Alameda County District Attorney 's Office had issued a warrant for his arrest for homicide , according to the Douglas County Sheriff 's Office .
Oakland police provided the sheriff 's office information Tuesday morning that Mehserle was in the Zephyr Cove area of Lake Tahoe , Nev. , the sheriff 's office reported .
After receiving confirmation that an arrest warrant had been issued , authorities contacted Mehserle 's attorney , who in turn called Mehserle .
Mehserle left a home at 1007 Skyland Drive in Zephyr Cove and surrendered to sheriff 's officials without incident at about 6:20 p.m. , the sheriff 's office reported .
" We want the public to know that this one incident is not reflective of BART , its police or its employees , " BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger said .
" I have great confidence in the professionalism of the BART Police Department .
This was a tragic event in which a life was lost for which someone has been arrested and charged . "
He was booked into the Douglas County Sheriff 's Office main jail in Minden , according to the sheriff 's office .
He had been kept in a segregated area of the facility and is on a precautionary health and welfare watch , according to the sheriff 's office .
The shooting at the Fruitvale station in Oakland occurred shortly after 2 a.m. on Jan. 1 when Mehserle and other officers stopped a train at the station in Oakland after receiving reports that two groups of men were fighting on the train .
The shooting , which is under investigation by multiple agencies , has prompted protests in the Bay Area , including a violent demonstration last week in Oakland .
Another protest is scheduled for 4 p.m. today outside Oakland 's City Hall .

Larry Craig talks with the media at the Idaho Republican party in this Oct. 4 file photo .
The former Republican senator from Idaho is dropping his appeal to reverse his misdemeanor conviction in an airport restroom sex sting in Minneapolis .
MINNEAPOLIS ( AP )  Former Idaho Sen. Larry Craig has reached the end of the road in his effort to reverse his conviction in an airport bathroom sex sting , one of his lawyers said Thursday .
Attorney Tom Kelly said Craig had decided against asking the Minnesota Supreme Court to void the conviction .
The decision means the legal wrangling in the case is over .
" We 've concluded that the Supreme Court would not accept this for review , " Kelly said .
" It would be a futile exercise . "
Thursday was the 30 - day deadline for Craig to ask the high court to review a Minnesota Court of Appeals decision that went against him .
The Supreme Court typically grants only about 25 % to 30 % of those requests , according to court figures .
The Idaho Republican was arrested June 11 , 2007 , by an undercover police officer conducting a sting operation against men cruising for sex at the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport .
The senator quietly pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid a fine , but changed his mind after word of his arrest later became public .
As his political career disintegrated , Craig insisted he was innocent and that he was not gay .
He said the officer had misconstrued his foot - tapping actions in the airport bathroom .
Last month , the Minnesota Court of Appeals rejected Craig 's bid to withdraw his guilty plea .
It affirmed a lower court decision that his plea was " accurate , voluntary and intelligent " and that it was supported by the evidence .
Craig did not seek re-election in November for the seat he had held for 18 years .
He was succeeded Tuesday by political veteran Jim Risch , a Republican former lieutenant governor , governor and state senator .

These are some of the folks whose votes that democracy - hating Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) is going to the state Supreme Court to keep from being counted in the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota ...
The video , produced by challenger Al Franken 's campaign , was described by the Coleman camp as " a new low . "
As Republicanists tend to project just about everything they do on others , we 'd suggest that there may be " a new low " here , but in this case , it ai n't coming from the Franken camp .
As we reported on Friday , the state canvassing board --- made up of Republicans ( two are MN Supreme Court judges ) , Democrats , and Independents --- ruled unanimously in favor of counting the 1,600 or so absentee ballots which were improperly rejected by election officials and not counted originally in the state 's razor - close U.S. Senate race .
Hopefully those ballots now will be counted , unless Coleman has his way in the Supreme Court where he hopes to get an order to stop the counting of legal ballots cast by folks like those seen in the video above .
Nice .
CORRECTION :
The original version of this article referred to 16,000 rather than 1,600 improperly rejected absentee ballots .

It 's been just about ten full months since Myka 's BitTorrent box was formally introduced to Earthlings , but it seems like the wheels are finally turning on production way across the way in China .
According to a promising update on Myka 's official website , " production is in full swing , " which means that boxes should start arriving to eager consumers in around four to six weeks .
For those unaware , this here box pulls down torrents as you sleep and then plays 'em back nicely on your connected HDTV .

So recently I had the challenge of creating a ‘ has_many through ’ relationship across two databases .
“ Why would you do this ? ” you may ask .
Well quite simply I am in a team building a new data management system to sit on top of a legacy system with its legacy database .
All the new code is new , shiny and streamlined and the old code is … well … crap but we have to keep both systems running concurrently so we have various tables in the legacy database we need to access from the new system .
As it happens we need to access the legacy users table in a ‘ has_many through ’ from the new ‘ orders ’ table .
Set Up Your Secondary Database Connection
You can quite happily set up a model to connect do a database other then the default by setting the connection up in your ‘ config/database.yml ’ as follows :
legacy : adapter : < adapter > database : < database > username : < username > password : < password >
And then in any model you want to use with your secondary database :
< model>.establish_connection configurations [ ' legacy ' ]
Create Your ‘ Through ’ Model
Now a normal ‘ has_many through ’ just plain wo n’t work between models attached to two different databases but a normal has_many will .
So we can create ‘ has_many through ’ functionality in the following way :
Set up your ‘ through ’ model on either database .
It really does n’t matter which and set it to ‘ belong_to ’ your two main models .
Set both main models to ‘ has_many ’ of your ‘ through ’ model .
Create Your ‘ Through ’ Relationship
Use the following code in each of your main models to mimic the ‘ has_many through ’ association .
In this example I ’m using ‘ orders ’ and ‘ users ’ and my ‘ through ’ table is ‘ order_users ’ :
In ‘ order ’
def users user = [ ] order_users .
each do |ou| user << ou.user end user end
In ‘user ’
def orders order = [ ] order_users .
each do |ou| order << ou.user end order end
And you ’re done .
Now the relationship will work just like any other ‘ has_many through ’ .
One of the firms participating in the London Array project , under which the world 's biggest offshore wind farm would be built in the outer Thames Estuary , has questioned the scheme 's economic viability .
The Financial Times reported at the weekend that Paul Golby , chief executive of E.ON UK - which owns 30 per cent of the Array venture - says that " the economics [ of the Array ] are looking pretty difficult " .
Offshore windfarms like the Array are much more expensive to build and maintain than onshore ones , costing roughly twice as much .
The FT quotes energy major Centrica as estimating the cost of offshore capacity at £ 3 m per megawatt , more than double what it costs to build nuclear stations .
The cost of the electricity produced is even worse than this figure indicates ; wind farms ' average output over time is around 30 per cent of their capacity , whereas nuclear stations typically run at 90 per cent .
Thus , it costs more than six times as much to build a given level of power production using windfarms as it does using nuclear .
The FT quotes Sam Laidlaw , Centrica chief :
“ We are planning to invest in 1,500 MW of offshore wind capacity , but it is very expensive , both in capital cost and in maintenance . ”
To be sure , nuclear plants need fuel and windfarms do n't - but fuel costs are a very small proportion of what it costs to make nuclear energy .
Most of the price goes on building , running and ultimately decommissioning the plant , and on storing wastes .
And there are those who would argue that windfarm cost figures still do n't take enough account of the need for backup gas - turbine power for calms or gales , and the consequent emissions and stress on the gas grid .
Either way , Golby , Laidlaw and their industry colleagues seem to feel that bigger subsidies will be required if they are to build the kind of wind base the government says it wants to see .
They say that recent falls in gas and carbon prices have worsened the already - gloomy economic picture for offshore wind significantly .
The London Array seemed to be under threat last year when Shell , with a 20 per cent stake , pulled out of the project saying it was uneconomic .
However , Shell 's place was taken by the emir of Abu Dhabi .
E.ON has 30 per cent , and the other half is owned by DONG Energy of Denmark .
When complete , the Array is expected to yield sufficient energy to run 135,000 average UK homes *.
The FT says that the Crown Estates , owner of the seabed on which the wind turbines will be erected , is meeting with further potential investors this week .
The government , strongly in favour of the scheme , is hoping that the negotiations may yield further funding for the Array . ®
* This includes heating , hot water and other energy consumption which in most British homes today is done using gas or heating oil .
The Array prefers to say that it would generate " enough power for three - quarters of a million homes " , but this considers present - day electricity use only , not the total energy consumed .
Former Pro Wrestler Verne Gagne Causes Death of 97 Year Old Man
Verne Gagne , 82 year old former pro wrestler and promoter based in Minneapolis , caused the death of a 97 year old man at a Bloomington , Minnesota nursing home .
Gagne and Helmut Gutmann , both suffering from Alzheimer 's related dementia , have been living in the memory loss unit of Friendship Village retirement community .
The two men got into a fight on January 26 that ended with Gutmann suffering a broken hip and head injury .
He was hospitalized , released and re-hospitalized due to complications .
He died of his injuries on February 14 , 2009 .
Ruth Hennig , a daughter of the deceased said , " No one knows what led to the altercation .
I do n't think anyone was present when it began ... or even if anything precipitated it .
All I know is that my father was lifted off of the floor and slammed to the ground . "
She reported that her father had " no memory at all " of the clash with Gagne .
Hennig is n't sure whether Gagne should be prosecuted .
" We 're still dealing with the death on an emotional level . "
Mike Opitz , an investigator with the medical examiner 's office indicates that the cause of death has been ruled a homicide .
Bloomington Deputy Police Chief Perry Heles indicates the matter is still being investigated to determine whether to recommend charges against Gagne .
On March 12 , 2009 , the Hennepin County Prosecutor 's office officially announced that Gagne would not be criminally charged as a result of the death .
Because of his dementia , he lacked the mental capacity necessary to have intended to harm Gutmann .
Verne Gagne was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in April 2006 by his son , Greg Gagne .
He has also been inducted into the WCW Hall of Fame , Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame , and Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame .
His signature move was his sleeper hold .
UPDATE : December 3 , 2009 - Gagne 's granddaughter , Gail Gagne , a teacher and coach in the Twin Cities , was charged with sexual misconduct for having sex with a 16 - year - old student .
Here 's a bright spot in an overcast economy : Solar panel prices are tumbling .
Prices for rooftop solar systems , including installation , already have fallen 8 % to 10 % since October and are expected to drop another 15 % to 20 % this year .
Fueling the trend are an oversupply of worldwide manufacturing capacity and lower demand , especially in Spain and Germany , which have been growth engines for the industry .
For U.S. homeowners , effective prices are likely to plunge by more than 50 % after figuring in a bigger federal tax credit that took effect Jan .
1 .
" The era of extremely expensive ( solar ) modules is over , " says analyst Nathaniel Bullard of research firm New Energy Finance .
Since 2004 , solar prices have been propped up by a shortage of capacity to make both silicon — the raw material for solar - power systems — and finished panels .
Meantime , the Spanish and German governments have paid system owners hefty subsidies to generate solar power , turbocharging sales in those countries .
Manufacturers responded by building a wave of factories .
Then Spain and Germany slashed this year 's incentives .
In the U.S. , the biggest solar investors were banks such as Morgan Stanley that can no longer benefit from tax credits because of insufficient profits .
New Energy projects an oversupply of nearly 4 gigawatts of solar modules in 2009 , or enough electricity to supply 2.6 million homes .
The glut is already dragging down prices .
Barry Cinammon , CEO of Akeena Solar , one of the nation 's largest installers , says wholesale prices have fallen about 15 % since October .
Since installation accounts for about half the cost of a system , total costs are down about 8 % .
SunPower , one of the largest manufacturers , expects retail prices for its solar modules to dip as much as 20 % this year .
" Now , all of a sudden , we have module manufacturers calling us , " says Peter Rive , chief operating officer of Solar City , the No. 1 installer .
Consumers can reap even bigger gains if they can buy in a recession .
Until this year , homeowners who bought solar systems were eligible for a tax credit that shaved system prices 30 % , but the credit was capped at $ 2,000 .
Last fall , Congress renewed the 30 % credit and removed the cap , lopping thousands more dollars off solar price tags .
In California , which accounts for nearly 70 % of the U.S. solar market , a typical 4 - kilowatt , $ 32,000 solar energy system cost a homeowner about $ 23,000 last year after state and federal incentives .
This year , if prices sink as expected , that system is likely to cost $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 .
The Red Cross has accused the Israeli army of hindering its rescue teams after saying it found four children lying next to their dead mothers in the wreckage of a shell - battered Gaza City neighbourhoood .
In a scathing statement , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) accused the Israeli army of failing to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded .
The Red Cross said its rescue teams had been refused access to the Zeitun neighbourhood for four days .
The delay in allowing access to rescuers was " unacceptable , " the ICRC said .
When the rescue team , which included members of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society , was allowed into the area , it found four small children next to their dead mothers in one of the houses , the Red Cross said .
The ICRC said the children were too weak to stand up on their own .
" One man was also found alive , too weak to stand up .
In all there were at least 12 corpses lying on mattresses , " the ICRC said .
Fifteen survivors , several of them wounded , were found in one house .
The ambulances could not get over earth walls piled up by Israeli army bulldozers to block enemy fighters , so donkey carts were brought in to evacuate the survivors .
" This is a shocking incident , " said Pierre Wettach , who heads the ICRC 's delegation for Israel and the Palestinian territories .
" The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded .
Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestine Red Crescent to assist the wounded . "
Israel says the team could not go in because of fighting in the area , and that it does coordinate with aid agencies .
But it is coming under increasing international pressure over the civilian situation in the territory .
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has suspended its work in Gaza after one of its aid convoys was shelled by Israeli forces .
" UNRWA decided to suspend all its operations in the Gaza Strip because of the increasing hostile actions against its premises and personnel , " Adnan Abu Hasna , a Gaza - based UNRWA spokesman said .
Mr Hasna did not say how long the suspension would last .
" A convoy going towards Erez came under fire , according to the contractor , " said the UNRWA 's Chris Gunness .
" Two tank shells impacted near a forklift , and one person was killed , " he said .
" The forklift trucks had been contracted to pick up UN goods , " he said , adding that the convoy had been coordinated with the Israeli military .
The Israeli army said it was investigating .
About 250 foreigners have been evacuated from Gaza City to Israel , but hundreds are believed to be still in the territory .
I , Anonymous Dear Racist Asshole
I 'm the one who found your lost cell phone on the street .
My first instinct was to find out whom it belonged to and return it , to do my Good Samaritan deed .
It was n't password protected , so I looked around on it to find some identifying information .
That 's when I found all your Election Day text messages between you and your other racist buddies .
" Did you hear that Hallmark has a new Obama presidential Christmas ornament ?
Now everyone can hang that nigger from a tree ! " and " The White House is now tearing out its Rose Garden and replacing it with a watermelon patch . "
There were ones worse than that .
Bless you , you white - supremacist fuck !
Two days after the election , I could n't have found a better celebratory gift !
I texted everyone in your contacts with this message : " I admit it , my racism is a sham !
The truth is I love black cock — in my mouth or up my ass , it does n't matter , it all makes me blow my load ! "
I figure a racist like you is probably also homophobic , so I 'm sure you have some explaining to do to your chums .
Out of decency , I did n't text your mom .
Even she does n't deserve to know what a racist piece of shit her son is .

It 's Not What You Eat , It 's How Much
The diet you choose does not matter as much as sticking to it , study says .
Feb. 26 , 2009  --
Dieters everywhere -- yo- yo dieters , crash dieters , fad dieters , dejected and jaded dieters -- may take heart .
A new study offers a flexible take on what it means to diet while underscoring fundamental rules about weight loss .
The study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , suggests the type of weight - loss diet does n't matter as much as sticking to it .
Researchers compared a low - fat , average protein diet , a low - fat , high - protein diet , a high - fat , average - protein diet , and a high - fat , high - protein diet in 811 middle - aged obese people over two years .
Each group lost an average of 13 pounds after one year , though slowly started to gain it back in the second year , bringing the average lost after two years to nine pounds .
" In the end , all the diets produced weight loss to the same extent , " said Dr. Frank Sacks , lead author of the study and professor in the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health .
" It really does n't matter what particular amounts of fat , carbohydrates or proteins you eat . "
Cut Calories , Cut Weight
The diets for each group were calibrated to the calories necessary for each participant to reach their ideal body - mass index -- which meant restricting calories overall .
" There really was n't magic revealed in the specific composition of the diet , " said Dr. Howard Eisenson , executive director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center .
" I thought their conclusions made sense and jibed with what many of us in the field have long been thinking . "
In addition to weight loss , subjects reduced their risk of heart disease and diabetes and improved their blood pressure .
The researchers used daily food reports , as well as one - on - one and group sessions with a dietician , to keep participants on track .
" All of that created a kind of synergy for keeping you motivated and informed , " said Rudy Termini , 69 , one of the study participants who ate a high - fat , moderate - protein diet totaling 1,800 calories each day .
Termini was more successful than the average study participant , dropping to 175 pounds from 195 pounds , a loss he since has maintained .
But the dietary changes were n't easy .
Termini was an anomaly for maintaining his diet given that his pre-study diet was very high in protein .
One of the study findings was that cutting calories was easier for those who ate fats , carbohydrates and proteins in the same proportions as they usually did .
" You can focus more on reducing calories rather than switching to a completely different diet type , " Sacks said .
" The more challenging diets were diets that departed a lot from usual intake . "
A Cultural Challenge
The challenge proved too great for some .
Termini said that about 10 people completed the two - year study in his focus group of 15 .
Catherine Loria , a nutritional epidemiologist at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and another author on the study , pointed out that only 15 percent of the participants were able to reduce their body weight by 10 percent after the two years and that there were some who gained more weight than they initially lost .
Not everyone was impressed with the study 's findings .
An editorial in the same journal challenges the study 's optimistic tone , pointing out that subjects were not sticking to the specified calorie allowance based on their eventual weight gain , nor were they eating meals in the specified proportions of nutrients .
Tests showed that , over time , the protein intake between the high - protein diet and the average - protein diet groups , which should have differed by 10 percent , dwindled to a 1 to 2 percent difference .
The highest and lowest carbohydrate diet groups , which should have differed in carbohydrate intake by 30 percent , differed by only 6 percent .
Martijn Katan , the author of the editorial , said the data suggest that failure to lose weight is a behavioral problem bolstered by the nutritional environment of the U.S .

" We do not need another diet trial ; we need a change of paradigm , " Katan said .
While the study authors agreed that creating a healthier food environment is a crucial goal in a country where 78 million people are obese -- 12.5 million of whom are children , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- they denied Katan 's statement that individual efforts at weight loss are not significant .
" We 're never going to have a perfect environment and people have to be willing to make those changes , " Loria said .
" I do n't think you can be successful unless you have both . "
In terms of dieting , community support can be critical but choosing a plan is up to an individual , and the hardest part of losing weight may be accepting the hunger factor .
Past studies have shown that calorie restriction is the biggest determining factor for successful weight loss , even greater than exercise .
" There are those with unrelenting optimism , who think [ dieting ] is going to get easier , " said Marlene Schwartz , deputy director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University .
" But if you are eating fewer calories than you are burning , you are going to be hungry . "
But the study 's findings encourage experimentation , Sacks said , and the flexibility to find the best balance of calorie restriction and satisfaction for individuals .
" The hardest thing , having been born and raised in America , [ was that ]
I thought I was entitled to eat as much as I wanted whenever I wanted and I would stay the same weight , " Termini said .
" But you ca n't do that .
And it 's not healthy . "

" Never let a serious crisis go to waste .
What I mean by that is it's an opportunity to do things you could n't do before . "
So said White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel in November , and Democrats in Congress are certainly taking his advice to heart .
The 647 - page , $ 825 billion House legislation is being sold as an economic " stimulus , " but now that Democrats have finally released the details we understand Rahm 's point much better .
This is a political wonder that manages to spend money on just about every pent - up Democratic proposal of the last 40 years .
We 've looked it over , and even we can't quite believe it .
There 's $ 1 billion for Amtrak , the federal railroad that has n't turned a profit in 40 years ; $ 2 billion for child - care subsidies ; $ 50 million for that great engine of job creation , the National Endowment for the Arts ; $ 400 million for global - warming research and another $ 2.4 billion for carbon - capture demonstration projects .
There 's even $ 650 million on top of the billions already doled out to pay for digital TV conversion coupons .
In selling the plan , President Obama has said this bill will make " dramatic investments to revive our flagging economy . "
Well , you be the judge .
Some $ 30 billion , or less than 5 % of the spending in the bill , is for fixing bridges or other highway projects .
There 's another $ 40 billion for broadband and electric grid development , airports and clean water projects that are arguably worthwhile priorities .
Add the roughly $ 20 billion for business tax cuts , and by our estimate only $ 90 billion out of $ 825 billion , or about 12 cents of every $ 1 , is for something that can plausibly be considered a growth stimulus .
And even many of these projects are n't likely to help the economy immediately .
As Peter Orszag , the President 's new budget director , told Congress a year ago , " even those [ public works ] that are ' on the shelf ' generally cannot be undertaken quickly enough to provide timely stimulus to the economy . "
12 things to throw at Bush / A shoe ?
Not bad .
But surely we can do better
A shoe is an honest choice .
Civilized .
Convenient .
Sends a simple " you 're an artless jackass , and everyone knows it " kind of message .
What 's more , a hurled shoe is a timeless bit of wisecrackery , sort of like a pie in the face or standing up and hurling your drink at your two - faced lover in a restaurant .
Classic .
But this is Dubya we 're talking about .
Worst .
President .
Ever .
Surely he deserves better .
Surely he deserves something a bit more ... thoughtful ?
Profound ?
Ironic ?
After all , while a shoe is nice , it 's also terribly cliched .
Boring , even .
Of course , I officially endorse none of the following far more appropriate , delightfully hurl - able options .
Do not ever throw anything at President Bush , because you could get shot or perhaps go to jail for a very long time , which , despite how you'd be hailed a hero worldwide forevermore , would just be no fun at all .
Do n't do it .
Throwing is wrong .
OK ?
1 ) Rainbow flag
Obvious , but effective .
What better way to say , " Thanks for keeping the last fundamental civil right in hateful lockdown for another 20 years by kowtowing to the sexually ignorant and the religiously malformed , you sad lump of homophobic lint . "
Bonus suggestion : Attach small photo of Bush 's new son - in - law and Rove sycophant , Henry Hager , to the flag .
Implied rumor : Henry 's secretly gay !
Just like half the GOP and all televangelists and John Travolta !
The AP photogs will eat it up .
Note :
Be sure to fold flag tightly for ideal trajectory , lest it unravel mid-flight and accidentally land on the head of the Saudi Arabian reporter , inducing horrified screams and spontaneous combustion .
No one wants a scene .
2 ) Book about science
Clever !
Something this president has actually never seen before : A real book full of complex ideas written by people who actually understand that humans did n't ride on the backs of dinosaurs , the Earth is not a giant litter box made of Cheez - Whiz and Jesus spittle , and that the Bible is basically a violent little children 's fable .
Amazing .
Make it a soft paperback , because those hardbacks are a bitch and you do n't want to hurt anyone .
Remember , science is your friend .
3 ) Birth control pills
Turns out those little pink plastic saucer things actually soar quite well when hurled like little Frisbees o' Female Empowerment .
It 's a nice way to thank Bush for sucking the sour teat of the sexist religious right and Catholic church , front - loading the nation 's courts with misogynist judges and stabbing at the heart of women 's rights for nearly a decade .
Alternative : Load individual RU - 486 pills into a large straw and blast them at Bush 's head like Divine Spitwads of Cervical Righteousness .
It 's more sustained fun , and might get you in less trouble overall .
Do n't forget to aim a few at Jenna , in the honest hope she will never , ever breed .
Hey , it 's for her own good .
Did n't you know her husband is secretly gay ?
I swear I just read that somewhere .
4 ) Crayons
Back in the early days of the Worst Presidency Ever , Bush used mostly Burnt Sienna with the occasional Purple Pizzazz .
But lately Dubya 's been turning to Mango Tango and Beaver , with a bit of Neon Carrot -- saying that one aloud always makes him giggle -- to sign all those laws , last - minute enviro rollbacks , sweetheart deals to Big Oil , final bitch - slaps and FUs to the conscious and the hopeful .
Did you know the Crayola company officially replaced Teal Blue with a color called " Wild Blue Yonder " ?
That makes George feel proud to be an American .
He says to himself , " You think that damn Al Qaeda would ever use a color like that ?
You 're gul - dang right they would n't !
They 're use some stupid America - hating color like Terrorism Turquoise or Suicide Bomber Sepia . Jerks ! "
5 ) Dick Cheney
Cheney , thought to be made up entirely of black tar , razor blades and cold , glowering evil , certainly looks like he weighs as much as a tumescent water buffalo , and therefore would be just impossibly difficult to raise over your head and heave at Bush with any sort of accuracy or distance .
Turns out , however , that Dick is merely a phantasm , a collective nightmare , a little smear of something slimy and gray and unidentifiable , like you find on a dark road after it rains .
Deeply unpleasant , but also nearly weightless .
Easy to fling , after all !
Warning :
Do not to get any on your fingers or anywhere near your eyes or other mucus membranes .
He may be an ephemeral hellbeast , but he 's still one enormously toxic Dick .
6 ) Hunk of glacial ice
Not much left , so you 'd better hurry .
Here , George , shove this last snowball from what 's left of Greenland into your lemonade this summer at the ranch .
Thanks for all the brutal enviro rollbacks and rejecting Kyoto and making America the pathetic laughingstock of the entire scientific community .
May you reincarnate as a starving , scabrous polar bear , adrift on a melting ice floe , wondering what happened to your home .
Alternate : hunk of ozone .
For nearly identical reasons .
7 ) Prosthetic limb
Imagine this perfect scene :
You raise your right hand to ask Bush a question .
Bush points at you , " Yes ? "
You calmly raise your left hand , reach over to your right and give a little tug and pop !
Off comes your entire right arm from the socket !
Before anyone can register what 's happening , said arm is winging through the air , straight at Bush 's head .
Bonk !
See ?
Not only have you conked him , you 've slapped him as well .
Now that 's poetry .
Terrific reminder of the tens of thousands of young U.S. soldiers who 've been maimed , mutilated and permanently scarred in Bush 's lost , futile , disgusting war .
Imagine the hilarious photos !
It 's tragicomic , really .
8 ) Hanging chads
Because we will never forget .
9 ) WMD
Good luck finding any .
Maybe over in Pakistan ?
North Korea ?
Toronto ?
Still , imagine the shock on Bush 's tired face .
Finally , some WMD !
Right here in my lap !
He 'd stroke it like a feral kitten and cry .
Alternate choice : Glowering Taliban fighter .
There 's been a big resurgence , after all .
Plenty to go around .
Plus , Islamic terrorist jackals do n't eat much .
Makes them light as pillows .
Fun to throw !
10 ) National sense of pride / hope / dignity
We used to have quite a lot .
Now the only place to really find any is over at Obama transition headquarters , where they 're giving it out to desperate citizens for free , by the truckload , as much as you can carry , like medicine from the Red Cross after a major disaster .
Problem : People have been throwing this stuff at Bush for years , with zero effect .
He just thinks it 's some sort of bizarre foreign food and feeds it to the dog .
Or Saudi Arabia .
11 ) Entire remainder of gutted , ruined Republican party
This quivering mass of ignoble sadness and blighted phlegm will now fit comfortably into the palm of your hand , ready to hurl .
Be sure to wear gloves .
One drawback : Most Republicans are already chucking huge , angry hunks of blame at Bush for destroying the Cult of the Great God Reagan .
You might have to get in line .
12 ) Reality
Throw some if you can , but if possible , better to just run up and dump enormous buckets of it over Bush 's head .
Of course , he will not notice .
He will merely blink a few times and get that look on his face like he almost had a thought , then it passed , like a bit of gas .
Reality has evaded this president for eight solid years and possibly over two million lifetimes .
He will never , ever see it .
No matter .
At least it 's real .
And it still beats a shoe .

Coleman campaign rejects election judge 's ballot Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 31 , 2008
Print This Email This With Al Franken holding onto a 49 - vote lead in the Minnesota Senate recount , incumbent Republican Norm Coleman seems to be pulling out the stops in his attempt to keep as many likely Democratic absentee ballots as possible out of the tally .
Election officials across the state are determining which absentee ballots were rejected improperly on Election Day , and both campaigns have to agree before a previously rejected ballot is counted .
As the Star Tribune reports , Coleman rejected 59 of 60 ballots that were set aside in St. Louis County , which supported Franken .
His decision to reject Shirly Graham 's ballot was particularly shocking .
" I'm an election judge , " Graham told the paper .
" I expected to be the last person whose ballot would n't be counted . "
Graham , who actually voted for Coleman , said she would consider going to court to have her ballot included .
Coleman 's campaign argued that the ballot was invalid because the date next to Graham 's signature did not match the date next to the witness who also signed the ballot .
As Nate Silver notes , the ballot decision may demonstrate that Franken 's campaign should perhaps be concerned about the events in St. Louis County .
There are a couple of things in the preceding paragraphs that the Franken campaign ought to be worried about .
Firstly , quite a high percentage of absentee ballots were rejected -- 60 out of what had been reported yesterday to be 161 ballots under consideration in St. Louis County , or 37 percent .
All but one of those objections were made by the Coleman campaign .
Secondly , the Coleman campaign is getting away with blocking ballots for asinine reasons .
In the case cited above , for instance , the ballot was rejected because the date provided by the voucher did not match the date the date provided by the voter .
Not only is there no requirement that the dates of the signatures match -- there is no requirement that the signatures are dated , period ( see the applicable statutes for yourself here and here ) .
Silver notes that Coleman 's heavy challenges came in " one of the bluest areas of Minnesota " and suggests that Franken could counter the strategy with heavy rejections in red counties .
Indeed , Coleman has been trying to skew his advantage , requesting the inclusion of 650 additional ballots from heavily red counties .
The recount and ensuing legal battles are expected to continue into the new year , but there has been discussion of seating Franken on at least a provisional basis when the 111th Congress is sworn in next week .

Frankly , I ’m shocked .
Jason Vorhees , who was just so human and vulnerable in New Line Cinema ’s recent reboot of the franchise , apparently has enough energy to show up for a sequel .
According to RiskyBizBlog , the screenwriters of the current film , Damian Shannon and Mark Swift , are getting started on a script for the second installment for Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema .
And here I did n’t even know they used a script for this first one .
Seeing as the first film kinda covered parts 1 , 2 , and 3 , maybe this one will dabble in parts 4 , 5 , and 6 .
Which would mean Jason will be legitimately dead in the middle of the movie and an imposter will be in his place .
( Or maybe since this new Jason is an imposter , we ’ll get to see the real Jason ! )
In other New Line news , Variety reports that after the success they had with their adaptation of the musical stage version of John Waters ’s Hairspray , they ’re now looking to adapt Damn Yankees , starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Shoeless Joe from Hannibal MO and Jim Carrey as Mr. Applegate ( aka the Devil ) , to whom Joe sells his soul to play ball for the Washington Senators .
Personally , I like the sound of this .
I love the original musical , and the previous film adaptation sucked .
If Hairspray was any indication , then New Line apparently knows what to do with the musical genre and will get the right people working on this .
I worry about Jake Gyllenhaal , though …can he sing ??
Carrey , however , is an inspired choice to play the Devil , and I think he ’ll do great .
I ’m looking forward to this !
And that damn as - of - yet - untitled Woody Allen picture just keeps getting larger .
Having already secured , Anthony Hopkins , Josh Brolin , Naomi Watts , and Slumdog Millionaire ‘s Freida Pinto , Allen has gotten his hands on Anthony Flags himself !
Er…Antonio Banderas , as I hear he prefers to be called .
All I ’m gonna say is this movie better be good , Woody .
Let ’s try and punch out another Vicky Cristina Barcelona , and not another Cassandra ’s Dream .

One classic technique that digital cameras make very easy is blending more than one exposure together for contrast control , increased dynamic range , or creative purposes .
A variation on this technique is to apply different RAW - conversion settings to a single RAW file and then combine the files into a single image .
Let ’s explore both approaches and look at the proper camera technique behind the scenes .
[ If you ’d like to download the images used in this tutorial to practice these techniques , click here .
All files are for personal use only . ]
Camera Technique for Capturing Two Exposures
1 Set up on Tripod
Before you start in Photoshop , you have to create the files so that each has a good exposure for a specific part of the image .
For the files to align properly , it ’s best to be on a tripod .
Although handheld , rapid - fire , auto - exposure bracketing may work in some cases , I prefer the tripod approach .
The tripod is definitely a must for long exposures , such as the photos in this example , which had shutter speeds of 13 and 25 seconds .
I used a 5 - stop , solid , neutral - density filter to force a long exposure time that would totally blur the surf .
2 Use Remote Shutter Release
In the images of Makapuu Point on the island of Oahu in Hawaii , the sky and most of the ocean looks better in the 13 - second exposure , while the longer one reveals better detail in the dark foreground rocks .
I also like the way the incoming surf is blurred into a fine mist in the 25 - second shot .
To minimize any chance of vibration that might yield a soft shot , I turned off lens stabilization and used an electronic cable release .
For the purposes of this tutorial , the files are JPEGs , but I recommend you shoot RAW for the most control and quality .
Blend the Two Exposures
1 Bring Exposures Into One File
The first step is to bring the two exposures into a single layered file .
For this example , we ’re adding the darker exposure to the lighter image so that it will be the top layer .
Select the Move tool ( V ) , hold down the Shift key , and drag - and - drop the darker image onto the lighter one .
Hold down the Shift key until the image appears in the lighter file as a new layer .
This ensures that the two pictures are perfectly aligned .
2 Add a Layer Mask
Now we ’ll add a layer mask to show only the “ good ” areas of the top layer .
Depending on the nature of the images you ’re combining and the complexity of the edge , this is the part of the process that will be different for each image .
Some scenes may require intricate and precise masks , while for others a soft - edged mask will do ; we ’ll use a soft - edged mask for this image .
With the top layer active , click the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the Layers panel .
3 Paint the Layer Mask to Reveal the Lighter Image
Choose the Brush tool ( B ) from the Toolbox and set the Foreground color to black .
In the Options Bar , set the Opacity to 50 % and choose a soft - edged brush that ’s large enough to cover the bottom part of the image ( ours is 300 pixels ) .
Check the Layers panel to make sure the layer mask is active ( look for the highlight border around the thumbnail ) .
Paint over the image where you want to reveal the lighter tones from the bottom layer ( paint multiple strokes to reveal more of the lighter layer ) .
Reduce the brush size to work on the areas where the two images meet at the edge of the rocks .
4 Add a Grouped Adjustment Layer
We lowered the Opacity to 20 % and painted with black over the distant hill to show more detail there .
To reverse the mask edits , press X to switch the Foreground and Background colors , and paint with white to bring back the darker layer .
To add a contrast punch to the top layer , Option - click ( PC : Alt - click ) on the Create New Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel and choose Curves .
Turn on the Use Previous Layer to Create Clipping Mask checkbox and click OK .
Adjust the curve as shown .
The clipping mask means that it affects only the underlying layer .
5 Debriefing
If you click on the Background layer ’s Eye icon , you can see how the layer mask controls which parts of the top darker layer are visible in the final composite .
Click again to turn on the Background layer ’s visibility , then Shift - click the layer mask to temporarily disable it and view the darker image without the lighter foreground .
Shift - click the layer mask again to turn it on .
The soft - edged layer mask we used here works well because the long exposure times blurred the water and we do n’t have to be concerned with lining up the waves .
Dual - Process Raw
1 Raw Exposure Strategies for Dual Processing
If you have a single exposure , and it ’s a RAW exposure , then you can create essentially the same effect as in the previous steps .
This is useful for scenes that contain moving subjects or where a tripod is impractical or simply not an option .
The main thing you need to do in terms of exposure is bias the histogram as far to the right as possible without clipping the highlights ( i.e. , forcing the brightest areas to a total white ) .
This ensures you have the best exposure possible for the shadows , which will help minimize noise in those areas .
2 Process Raw Files as Smart Objects
Process the first version of the image in Adobe Camera Raw for a specific area ( in our example , we ’re keeping the sky from getting too washed out ) .
To preserve maximum flexibility , click on the blue Workflow Options link below the preview and turn on the Open in Photoshop as Smart Objects checkbox .
Click OK then Open Object to bring the file into Photoshop .
Choose Layer > Smart Objects > New Smart Object via Copy to create a duplicate smart object of the embedded RAW file ( the smart object duplication must be done this way to apply different RAW develop settings ) .
3 Process and Combine with Layer Masks
Double - click on the thumbnail for the duplicate smart object layer to access the Camera Raw dialog and adjust as needed for specific areas .
We used the Exposure , Fill Light , and Brightness sliders to show more detail on the rental surfboards .
Click OK to apply these new settings .
Now it ’s just a masking job to combine the two .
We used the Quick Selection tool ( W ) to make a basic selection of the bright sky , then used that to make a layer mask for the top Smart Object layer .
We then fine - tuned the edges using a Brush tool at varying opacities .

Gordon Brown was last night accused of “ losing his marbles ” after hailing Britain ’s bloodbath of job cuts as the “ birth pangs of a new global order ” .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In a speech that risked a furious backlash , the Prime Minister said the recession was his opportunity to forge a new global financial system .
Astonishingly , Mr Brown even claimed to have predicted the current financial crisis 10 years ago .
His boasts came as the tally of jobs axed or under threat this month hit 50,000 .
In one of the most devastating days since the economic downturn took hold , steel giant Corus confirmed the loss of 2,500 UK jobs and electronics manufacturer Philips announced 6,000 redundancies worldwide .
Theresa May , Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary , said : “ It is now clear that unemployment is fast becoming our number one political and economic issue and I fear this is yet more evidence that Labour ’s attempts at tackling the recession are n’t working . ”
Tory MP David Davies said : “ The Prime Minister ’s words indicate that he is losing his marbles as well as the economy .
Gordon Brown is the last person anyone would want in charge of a new world order . ”

Imagine you are serving on a jury : the defendant is charged with murder , but he also suffers from a brain tumor that causes erratic behavior .
Is he to be held responsible for the crime ?
Now imagine you are the judge :
What should the defendant ’s sentence be ?
Does the tumor count as a mitigating circumstance ?
The assignment of responsibility and the choice of an appropriate punishment lie at the heart of our justice system .
At the same time , these are cognitive processes like many others — reasoning , remembering , decision - making — and as such must originate in the brain .
These two facts lead to the intriguing question :
How does the brain enable judges , juries , and you and me to perform these tasks ?
What are the neural mechanisms that let you decide whether someone is guilty or innocent ?
A recent study published in the December 2008 issue of the journal Neuron , by Joshua Buckholtz and his colleagues at Vanderbilt University tackles exactly this question .
Until recently , such topics would have been out of the reach of cognitive neuroscience for lack of methods ; today , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) allows researchers to watch the brain “ in action ” as normal human participants make decisions about responsibility and punishment .
In the new study , Buckholtz and colleagues asked participants to read vignettes describing hypothetical crimes that a fictitious agent , “ John , ” commits against another person .
The stories were divided into three conditions : in the first , the “ responsibility ” ( R ) condition , the perpetrator was fully responsible for the negative consequences of his action against the victim ; for instance , John might have intentionally pushed his fiancée ’s lover off a cliff .
In the “ diminished responsibility ” ( DR ) condition , mitigating circumstances were present that reduced John ’s responsibility ; imagine that John committed the same crime , but suffered from a brain tumor .
And finally , the “ no crime ” ( NC ) condition consisted of stories that did not describe crimes .
The participants had to make judgments regarding the degree of punishment that John should receive , on a scale from one to nine .
The authors then analyzed the brain activation linked to these judgments .
To identify neural correlates of responsibility , they contrasted activation in the R and DR conditions .
Note that the stories in two conditions are identical , except for the degree to which John is responsible for his crime .
This contrast thus aims to identify which regions of the brain are involved in assigning responsibility for a crime , holding constant the crime itself .
Buckholtz and colleagues found a peak of activation in the right doroslateral prefrontal cortex ( rDLPFC ) , a brain region on the top surface of the right frontal lobe that is known to be involved in high - level cognitive processes such as reasoning and decision - making .
In addition , this same region was more active when subjects thought a diminished - responsibility crime deserved punishment compared with when it did not .
Thus , these findings suggest that rDLPFC might be involved in assigning responsibility for crimes , or making judgments about appropriate punishments .
Based on this finding , one might have expected that activation in rDLPFC should be higher when participants decide that very severe punishments are appropriate .
Buckholtz and colleagues found no correlation between neural activation and punishment magnitude in rDLPFC , however , suggesting that this brain region does not directly underlie the decision on the amount of punishment .
In contrast , there was some evidence that activation in emotion - related areas , such as the amygdala , correlates with the degree of punishment subjects assign to John : higher punishment scores were associated with higher activation in these regions during the decision period .
Reconciling the Findings
Have we found , then , the brain center for jurisprudence ?
Probably not : the brain regions identified in this new study , in particular right DLPFC , have previously been highlighted in a number of other studies addressing related but slightly different questions .
Unifying patterns do exist , however .
We therefore first describe some related studies , and then outline a possible reconciliation between the different findings .
What does rDLPFC do when it is n’t busy assigning responsibility for crimes ?
One answer comes from a study by Alan Sanfey and colleagues in 2003 : these authors found activation in rDLPFC when subjects decided whether to accept or reject a low offer in a two - person economic game called Ultimatum Game .
In addition , Daria Knoch and her colleagues in 2006 found that when rDLPFC was deactivated with a technique called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , participants became less able to reject low offers in this game , although they still judged these offers as very unfair .
A different line of work by Joshua Greene and colleagues in 2004 suggests that rDLPFC may be involved in moral reasoning .
They presented participants with moral dilemmas such as the decision whether or not to kill one ’s own crying child to keep it raising the attention of enemy soldiers and thereby endangering the whole group .
The rDLPFC region was activated when subjects acted in the interest of greater overall welfare , against their emotional impulses .
Finally , rDLPFC was also highlighted by another study involving social decision - making by Manfred Spitzer and colleagues in 2007 : these authors asked participants how much of their wealth they wanted to share with another player .
This amount was n’t very much , usually — unless participants were threatened with punishment .
Under the punishment threat , participants transferred more money , and rDLPFC was more active .
Moreover , the more subjects changed their behavior under the punishment threat relative to the situation without a threat , the more rDLPFC was activated , suggesting that rDLPFC played a key role in adapting behavior when facing the sanctioning threat .
The Big Picture
How does the new study fit together with the previous ones , and to what extent is a unifying interpretation of the role of rDLPFC across all these studies possible ?
The findings described above are all consistent with a role for rDLPFC in inhibiting what psychologists call “ prepotent responses , ” such as knee - jerk reactions .
Rejecting a low Ultimatum Game offer means losing money and thus requires overriding the impulse to accept the money .
Making utilitarian rather than emotion - driven moral decisions , and resisting the impulse to make low transfers to one ’s partner require the suppression of the impulses to save one ’s baby , in the one case , and to keep the money , in the other .
The activation of rDLPFC in these studies is consistent with the view that rDLPFC is involved in overriding such responses .
In addition , the TMS study mentioned above even suggests a key causal role of rDLPFC for overriding prepotent impulses because when rTMS inhibits the recruitment of rDLPFC , subjects are less able to resist the temptation to accept positive , yet unfair , money offers .
Is the new study by Buckholtz and colleagues consistent with this view of the role of rDLPFC ?
The crucial new element of this study is the fact that participants were instructed to determine “ appropriate ” judgments of punishment from a third - person perspective .
Thus , participants acted like criminal judges ; the fact that their punishment decisions correlated strongly with the prison sentences they deemed appropriate for the crimes in question attests to the fact that they saw themselves in this role .
Inasmuch as judges are expected to act impartially and objectively , this task , too , requires the suppression of prepotent responses to the crimes described , to produce “ just ” and impartial punishments .
Reading stories about severe crimes may well cause arousing emotional responses that may be associated with a strong desire to punish .
Indeed , Buckholtz and colleagues report that activation in the amygdala correlates with punishment judgments , consistent with the role of this brain region in the representation of arousing emotional events .
However , the demands of impartiality often require overriding these impulses to produce a reasonable judgment .
The higher activation of rDLPFC in the condition where John is responsible for his crime , and when participants decide if and how much to punish him , is therefore consistent with a role for rDLPFC in the suppression of prepotent emotional reactions .
Although it is unlikely that rDLPFC will enter the textbooks as the seat of the law in the brain , this intriguing new study by Buckholtz underscores the role of this region in high - level cognitive processes in general , and judgment and decision - making in particular .
More specifically , it illustrates that third - person judgment situations , such as those used in their study , may rely on similar neural mechanisms as two - person economic and social exchanges , and highlights rDLPFC as a candidate for the neural suppression of impulsive reactions in these situations .
So , should you punish John for the murder , despite his brain tumor ?
Of course !

Not so fast , says your rDLPFC .

If Reid thought it was legal to seat Franken now , would n't he say , " We 're going to seat Al Franken , " rather than " We 're going to try ...? "

This , in my opinion , has turned into a complete circus , and if the intention were to begin functioning as adults , addressing the bloodcurdling emergencies facing us , they would get Coleman 's legal challenges handled , over , history immediately , no waiting .
While I want Franken 's election to be deemed true and legal before he 's seated , we need all hands on deck , and clowns who do n't give a fuck about our duty to each other are the only ones who would be willing to stall this any longer .

The only way Reid will be taken down is if we insist on it , and even then it will be difficult to accomplish .
We need to make it known with one loud voice that both Reid and Pelosi must be removed , not only for these matters , but for sweeping violations of their sworn oath of office to protect and defend our Constitution .
One does n't give criminals a " get out of jail free " card while the crime spree is in progress .
These so - called Democrats did better than that : they drove the getaway car .
And we rewarded them by electing them in even greater numbers .
It is we , the electorate , who are responsible for this foolishness , and only we can fix it .
If we need to hold a figurative gun to their head next election , then we 'd better get it done or suffer the consequences .

Yeah Flo , between the corrupted justice system http://www.atlargely.com...uctions-documentary.html and intelligence systems as in your link and mine , and the co-opted media as in Brad 's article Airwaves We Can Believe
In , its no wonder Obama is asking us to be patient .
I can only hope to see the day all judges involved are removed for life and prosecuted , all lawyers involved are disbarred for life and prosecuted , all government employees are replaced and prosecuted ( idiotboy and company included ) and where ever anybody in that administration has moved to in privated industry the company be treated like a toxic waste site and the Fairness Doctrine is restored .
Glass Steigel should be restored also !

I 'm with Trippin , Pelosi and Reid must go !
And trying to seat Franken now is only to give ammunition to Republigoons , especially on the issue of elections .
What purpose would this even serve anyway ?
Like the article says , when Powerline and their ilk are calling Coleman 's case hypocritical and ridiculous , it 's only a matter of time for Franken to enter the Senate free of controversy - which I 'm sure HE would prefer .
A freshmen Senator has no clout to begin with , and Franken has it even rougher than most , having been a comedian for most of his life .

The only argument I would make in favor of such a move is that the State of MN is constitutionally guaranteed two representatives in the senate .
At the moment MN only has half the senate representation they are constitutionally allowed / required to have .
Thus , either the other already - seated MN senator should be able to cast 2 votes until the matter is settled , or they would at best be able to seat Franken ( or Coleman ) as an ' interim ' placeholder , similar to the way presidents appoint people to key positions when congress is n't in session .
Reid is doing a bunch of goofy stuff thats for sure .
Sadly he 's still FAR better than Pelosi .

Here is the text of email I sent to my US Representative , Jane Harman : I am very concerned over Harry Reid 's projection of pettiness , disorganization and weakness .
Dems ca n’t afford weekly retractions , mis-steps and course reversals by their house majority leader .
No doubt he ’s a good person with his heart in the right place .
He seems to be at the whim of day - to - day circumstances or not in the loop as opposed to being a badly needed force for ensuring that congressional dems speak with one voice ( as opposed to issuing commands to a herd of cats ) .
Please realize that most feel his heart is in the right place but his conduct renders him ineffective .
Specifically , there is a pattern of declaring things that cannot be backed up by consensus , established procedure or law .
When he does this he not only looks like a bufoon but he weakens the regard that all Americans have for Democrats in Congress , something those of us who elected Democratic representatives can ill afford .
In these situations it is better to temper the words or keep ones mouth shut .
Harry Reid has to learn that merely " saying so " does not make it so .
If he can possibly learn this then he will save himself and Democrats in the House a great deal of embarrasment .
I cannot see past the news but I wonder what his problem really is .
IS he lazy ?
Does he not consult others ?
Does he fall short as a consensus maker ?
Does he lack teh respect of his peers ?
I am groping to understand as so many Americans are .
There is so much hope ... and now this .
It is sad .
We will have a new President and the Democratic numbers in Congress suggest that a great deal of good can be done if there can be some semblance of unity .
Besides America needs this in order to move in a better direction after the last 8 years .
Sure there will be disagreements on principled points but the appearance of intemperate remarks from which he must quickly retract or back down from as Reid so often does just might be the undoing of this recent trust and support that has fallen into the Democrat 's laps .
Please do n't go and screw this up , OK ?
Is n't it possible to find a new majority leader ?
I just want to point you to two articles or blogs if you will , if that does not leave a bad taste in your mouth .
After all , I know you 've blogged at HuffPo yourself .
These blogs demonstrate the extent of the revulsion over Reids recent antics which have been all over the news .
Read the comments .
They are all reasonable surmisals of what has transpired .
Someone has to be concerned about all of this .
There is nothing imperial about his position , or for that matter , the tenure of anyone in Congress .
The worst thing about this is that there is so much hope and potential support that it could be squandered if Reid cannot be contained and continues to go off with characteristic , ineffectual hissy fits .
If he continues I fear that people will quickly forget the damage done by George Bush and swing voters will once again lean towards the Republican Party to get things done , however wrong - minded the opposing party is , because of their semblance of unity and the apparent weakness of the Democrats .
This is how George Bush got elected in the first place --- the office of President was handed to him on a silver platter and he miraculously managed not to screw up the election part .
Governing was a different story .
What can and will be done ?

CORAL GABLES , FL ( December 30 , 2008 ) — Self - control is critical for success in life , and a new study by University of Miami professor of Psychology Michael McCullough finds that religious people have more self - control than do their less religious counterparts .
These findings imply that religious people may be better at pursuing and achieving long - term goals that are important to them and their religious groups .
This , in turn , might help explain why religious people tend to have lower rates of substance abuse , better school achievement , less delinquency , better health behaviors , less depression , and longer lives .
In this research project , McCullough evaluated 8 decades worth of research on religion , which has been conducted in diverse samples of people from around the world .
He found persuasive evidence from a variety of domains within the social sciences , including neuroscience , economics , psychology , and sociology , that religious beliefs and religious behaviors are capable of encouraging people to exercise self - control and to more effectively regulate their emotions and behaviors , so that they can pursue valued goals .
The research paper , which summarizes the results of their review of the existing science , will be published in the January 2009 issue of Psychological Bulletin .
" The importance of self - control and self - regulation for understanding human behavior are well known to social scientists , but the possibility that the links of religiosity to self - control might explain the links of religiosity to health and behavior has not received much explicit attention , " said McCullough .
" We hope our paper will correct this oversight in the scientific literature . "
Among the most interesting conclusions that the research team drew were the following :
Religious rituals such as prayer and meditation affect the parts of the human brain that are most important for self - regulation and self - control ;
When people view their goals as " sacred , " they put more energy and effort into pursuing those goals , and therefore , are probably more effective at attaining them ;
Religious lifestyles may contribute to self - control by providing people with clear standards for their behavior , by causing people to monitor their own behavior more closely , and by giving people the sense that God is watching their behavior ;
The fact that religious people tend to be higher in self - control helps explain why religious people are less likely to misuse drugs and alcohol and experience problems with crime and delinquency .
McCullough 's review of the research on religion and self - control contributes to a better understanding of " how the same social force that motivates acts of charity and generosity can also motivate people to strap bomb belts around their waists and then blow themselves up in crowded city buses , " he explained .
" By thinking of religion as a social force that provides people with resources for controlling their impulses ( including the impulse for self - preservation , in some cases ) in the service of higher goals , religion can motivate people to do just about anything . "
Among the study 's more practical implications is that religious people may have at their disposal a set of unique psychological resources for adhering to their New Year 's Resolutions in the year to come .

I am studying the use of open source software in industry .
One way to obtain empirical data is to look at the operating systems and browsers used by the Fortune 1000 companies by examining browser logs .
I obtained a list of the Fortune 1000 domains and wrote a pipeline to summarize results by going through this site 's access logs .
My first pipeline was the following .
fgrep -h -f fortune - 1000 - domains. txt access_log | sed 's / ^\( [ ^ ] *\ ) . * " \( . [ ^ " ] *\ ) " $ /\1 \ 2 / ' | sort | uniq -c >results.txt
lj512272.crawl.yahoo.net - - [ 01/Jan/2008:00:00:15 +0200 ]
" GET / blog/20040121/index.html HTTP/1.0 " 200 4953 " -" " Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Yahoo !
Slurp ; http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/slurp) "
The Unix fgrep command is optimized for searching its input for ( a possibly large number of ) fixed strings .
To perform the search fgrep builds a data structure that looks at each character of its input at most once , even when matching hundreds of patterns .
The sed command I used takes each matching log line and prints from it only the domain name and the client details ( browser and operating system ) .
A typical web browser log line looks as follows .
The sed substitution command works by matching the space - terminated name of the domain , and then matching a sequence of characters within double quotes at the end of the line .
I felt a bit uneasy about the regular expression pattern I used , because you may need to try various solutions until you determine that you have found the pattern at the end of the line .
This requires backtracking and can be expensive .
Running top to see where my system was spending its time confirmed my suspicion .
PID USERNAME THR PRI NICE SIZE RES STATE TIME WCPU COMMAND 63910 dds 1 132 0 1328 K 728 K RUN 15:01 86.18 % sed 63913 dds 1 -8 0 1892 K 1160 K pipewr 0:09 0.10 % fgrep
As you can see , fgrep , which was supposed to be doing the difficult work was spending just 0.1 % of the system 's time , while the sed 's trivial post - processing step was taking 86 % of the time .
Obviously the pipeline was not properly balanced , and this would surely affect its performance .
I therefore rewrote the sed substitution command in a more imperative style .
sed 's / " $//;s/^\([ ^ ]*\ ) .*" /\1 /'
This removes the final quotation mark , and then greedily replaces the client 's address and all text up to the final quotation mark with just the client 's address .
This time the balance between the two processes was a lot more even .
PID USERNAME THR PRI NICE SIZE RES STATE TIME WCPU COMMAND 63709 dds 1 -8 0 1328 K 728 K piperd 0:14 46.55 % sed 63708 dds 1 - 4 0 1892 K 1156 K getblk 0:03 11.34 % fgrep
The performance difference between the two options was startling .
The first took 1004 s to complete , while the second one took just 114 s : an order of magnitude improvement .
This demonstrates the performance advantage of a well - tempered pipeline .

Usually I am all for buying things online and even talking to customer service over the phone or online instead of physically going to the store to deal with a matter .
For some reason , when my headset for the iPhone stopped working I decided it would be a great idea to go to the store to get a replacement instead of trying to see whether they could mail it to me .
I walked into the Apple Store at Menlo Park Mall and was immediately greeted by a nice guy who asked me about my problem .
I ended up going to the Genius Bar desk where I went on to describe that recently my right side of my headset stopped working .
I probably could have lasted longer with my headset but that is also the side with the microphone that I use to talk on the phone so the problem escalated in priority for me .
The first lady who looked at my headset went back to ask a “ technician ” whether this was covered in the AppleCare Protection Plan .
On their own website , it clearly states that the plan “ covers iPhone & iPhone Bluetooth hands - free headset and included accessories ” which I think is fair to say covers my problem .
Initially , they tried to scheme me into admitting that I physically broke my headset by either stepping over or not “ properly ” using it .
I was there with my brother where we both argued what is the point of the Protection Plan if it does not cover a simple problem like the headset ?
After being quite disappointed with the level of customer service I walked out and ended up calling Apple Customer Service before I even reached my car .
The guys ( Brian & Scott ) on the other end were very friendly throughout the entire conversation .
All he did was ask me about my problem , asked for my serial number and told me to wait 2 minutes while he asked someone whether he could help me out .
2 minutes later , he came back on the line to tell me that he was ready to mail me my new headset .
Since I was already out when I called , I asked him whether I could just pick it up at the store instead of him having to mail me and having to wait a couple of days before I could have this problem fixed .
He told me some CS code or number and gave me his direct line in case the store employee gave me trouble .
I walked back in the store and lady that initially told me that I could n’t have a replacement listen as I explained that I called Apple Customer Service and they issued me a code that I can pick up a replacement headset for free .
A couple of employees including the manager there at the time looked me like I had 3 eyes on my face or was an alien or something .
They seemed to have never heard of this number issued by Customer Service to customers .
The lady took the phone number and the CS code and walked into the backroom saying she would be right back .
About 10 - 15 minutes of waiting later , she walked out saying she could not reach the person and was only getting his voicemail .
I took the piece of paper back from her , dialed the number myself and reached him immediately – which makes me question how much she really tried to reach the guy .
So I ended up calling Scott and had the in - store manger talk to him as he explained what he had done for me .
After having this discussion , I thought my troubles would be over and they would simply just hand me a headset … and I could n’t have been more wrong if I tried .
Turns out even for a simple replacement , they needed me to schedule an appointment where they needed to fill out paper work for the replacement equipment and needed a “ technician ” to come out and replace the part for me .
I just cannot believe that they needed a technician to issue me a new headset and somehow the person behind the Genius Bar could n’t do a simple parts replacement .
The manager tells me to wait until the next technician which he could n’t give me an accurate estimate on how long it would take .
He estimated it would be 10 to 15 minutes and after a 20 - 25 minute wait later , a guy named Dan who I presumed is the “ technician ” called me up , entered took my name / email / serial number and printed out a receipt along with my replacement .
So about one hour , two phone calls to Apple Customer Service and talking to five different Apple employees later , I painfully and finally got my replacement headset .
NEW YORK , Dec. 6 ( UPI ) --
The father of former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer has been ordered to pay more than $ 1 million in penalties for discriminating against four black employees .
A state court jury took in New York took about four hours to decide that racism prompted Bernard Spitzer , 84 , to improperly fire a doorman and three porters in 1999 from a building he owned in Manhattan , the New York Post reported Saturday .
Advertisement
The jurors Friday ordered him to pay a total of $ 1.3 million to Anthony Haydenn , 34 , Akim Rodriguez , 38 , Leanard Boyce , 71 , and Treavor Morris , 32 .
The men filed suit nearly a decade ago .
They were seeking $ 8 million in damages , the newspaper said .
The elder Spitzer was not in court .
" We are more than disappointed , " said Spitzer spokesman Lloyd Kaplan .
" There was no evidence showing any discriminatory behavior by Mr. Spitzer . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Promising to return America to the " moral high ground " in the war on terrorism , President Obama issued three executive orders Thursday to demonstrate a clean break from the Bush administration , including one requiring that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility be closed within a year .
President Obama signs the order requiring that the Guantanamo Bay facility be closed within a year .
During a signing ceremony at the White House , Obama reaffirmed his inauguration pledge that the United States does not have " to continue with a false choice between our safety and our ideals . "
The president said he was issuing the order to close the facility in order to " restore the standards of due process and the core constitutional values that have made this country great even in the midst of war , even in dealing with terrorism . "
A second executive order formally bans torture by requiring that the Army field manual be used as the guide for terrorism interrogations .
That essentially ends the Bush administration 's CIA program of enhanced interrogation methods .
" We believe that the Army field manual reflects the best judgment of our military , that we can abide by a rule that says we do n't torture , but that we can still effectively obtain the intelligence that we need , " Obama said .
Watch Obama sign the orders »
" This is me following through ... on an understanding that dates back to our founding fathers , that we are willing to observe core standards of conduct not just when it 's easy but also when it 's hard . "
Watch Obama vow that the " U.S. will not torture " »
A third executive order establishes an interagency task force to lead a systematic review of detention policies and procedures and a review of all individual cases .
The task force , Obama stated , will also " provide me with information in terms of how we are able to deal [ with ] the disposition of some of the detainees that may be currently in Guantanamo that we cannot transfer to other countries , who could pose a serious danger to the United States . "
The president also signed a memorandum requesting a delay in the Supreme Court 's hearing of the case of Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , a legal U.S. resident contesting his detention for more than five years as an enemy combatant .
He has been held in a military brig without the government bringing any charges against him .
Al - Marri 's case is scheduled to be heard by the high court in March or April .
Al - Marri " is clearly a dangerous individual , " Obama said .
" We have asked for a delay in going before the Supreme Court to properly review the evidence against him . "
During the second Bush term , the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay became a lightning rod for critics who charged the Bush administration with torturing terrorist suspects .
President George W. Bush and other senior officials repeatedly denied that the U.S. government had used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects .
Watch experts debate the Guantanamo dilemma »
The decision to close the detention facility received immediate backing from Obama 's general election opponent , Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain .
McCain , in a joint statement with South Carolina GOP Sen .
Lindsey Graham , said he supported Obama 's decision to " reaffirm America 's adherence to the Geneva Conventions , and begin a process that will , we hope , lead to the resolution of all cases of Guantanamo detainees . "
Thursday night on CNN's " Larry King Live , " McCain said he thinks the new president may have been hasty in the decision and should have taken the time to consider everything associated with closing the camp before forcing himself into a timetable .
Specifically , McCain said he thought Obama needed to consider what would happen to the prisoners held at Guantanamo before ordering the facility to be closed .
" So , the easy part , in all due respect , is to say we 're going to close Guantanamo , " McCain said .
" Then I think I would have said where they were going to be taken .
Because you 're going to run into a NIMBY [ not in my backyard ] problem here in the United States of America . "
A number of congressional Republicans criticized Obama 's decision .
" We can not risk going back to the politically correct national security policies that left us vulnerable in the lead - up to 9/11 , " Michigan GOP Rep .
Peter Hoekstra , a member of the House Intelligence Committee , said in a written statement .
" Without a clear plan for the detention and interrogation of captured terrorists and combatants , we are unnecessarily risking the safety of our nation . "
Rep. John Murtha , D - Pennsylvania , an outspoken critic of the Bush administration , praised the action , calling it " a first key step in restoring America 's image and credibility in the world . "
" The Bush administration never understood what the Guantanamo detention facility symbolized to the rest of the world , " Murtha said in a written statement .
" They saw it as simply a prison .
...
The problem with Guantanamo was never about its bricks and mortar .
The problem with Guantanamo is that its very existence stains and defies the moral fiber of our great nation . "
Obama 's move highlights a fierce struggle over where the prison 's detainees will go next .
iReport.com : Closing Guantanamo is a " risk "
Asked about that issue Thursday , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said , " We have developed some options in terms of how many we think could be returned to other countries to take them .
That diplomatic initiative has not started .
That will await work in carrying out the executive order . "
" We have identified a number of possible prisons here in the United States " that could take the detainees .
However , Gates added , " I 've heard from members of Congress [ representing ] where all those prisons are located .
Their enthusiasm is limited . "
Watch what may happen to Guantanamo 's inmates »
Rep. Bill Young , R - Florida , said he has " quite a bit of anxiety " about the possibility of transferring detainees to U.S. facilities .
" Number one , they 're dangerous , " Young said .
" Secondly , once they become present in the United States , what is their legal status ?
What is their constitutional status ?
I worry about that , because I do n't want them to have the same constitutional rights that you and I have .
They 're our enemy . "
CNN 's Ed Henry , Barbara Starr and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

The Israeli propaganda blitz around their attack on Gaza has been greeted with uncharacteristic skepticism by the American public and even by some of the mainstream US press .
Even the Jewish American community is uneasy about this one , in a way perhaps unparalelled since the 1982 Israeli attack on Lebanon and siege of Beirut .
Jews for Peace in Los Angeles are actively protesting the Gaza atrocities , and newspaper articles from around the US on local protests held this weekend often mention mixed Arab - American and Jewish - American rallies .
If it is true that Americans are greeting Israeli talking points with more criticism this time , is it because we have been intensively exposed for the past 8 years to precisely this sort of mental manipulation by Bush - Cheney and their stable of Neoconservatives ?
Let ’s take some of the basic techniques of propaganda practiced by Bush and compare them to those deployed by the Israeli leadership in the past 8 days .
1 . Deny it all .
Bushie Examples : Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld denied that there was massive looting in Iraq during April of 2003 , alleging that CNN had one tape of a guy stealing a vase and kept looping it over and over again .
“ How many vases can they have ? ” he asked .
In mid-summer 2003 , Rumsfeld denied that there was a guerrilla war in Iraq , even though Jamie McIntyre of CNN was able to quote the Pentagon definition of guerrilla war , and it fit Iraq .
Rumsfeld just replied , “ No . ”
Cont’d /
Then there was Bush ’s insistence that “ Brownie ” had done a “ heckuva job ” in New Orleans after Katrina .
Kadima Examples :
When French President Sarkozy requested a two - day halt in Israeli air strikes so that humanitarian aid could reach ordinary Gazans , Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni replied , “ there is no humanitarian crisis in the [ Gaza ] Strip and therefore there is no need for a humanitarian truce . ”
The UN and others involved in humanitarian work in Gaza do not agree :
‘ the UN agency insisted it was desperate to get supplies into the enclave .
” The military incursion compounds the humanitarian crisis following more than a week of shelling and an 18 - month long blockade of the territory , ” the UN humanitarian coordinatory said in a daily report .
There was an “ almost total blackout ” across most of Gaza and land and mobile phone networks were also down because they depend on backup generators which had no fuel , the report said .
All Gaza City hospitals have been without mains electricity for 48 hours and now rely on backup generators which the UN said were “ close to collapse . ”
The report said that “ for the second consecutive day Israeli authorities have refused to allow an ICRC ( International Committee of the Red Cross ) emergency medical team into Gaza ” to help at the main Shifa hospital .
The territory has been sealed off for more than two days .
. .
More than 510 Palestinians have already been killed in Israel ’s nine day old offensive on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip , which on Saturday was intensified with the launch of a massive ground operation .
The UN said the tank fire and air attacks were preventing medical staff reaching hospitals and ambulances could not get to injured “ because of continuous fire . ”
The World Food Programme has coordinated emergency food deliveries into Gaza in recent months but the Israeli army said there was plenty of food in Gaza warehouses and that the territory ’s Hamas rulers had halted distribution . ’
In line with Livni ’s Big Lie , the Israeli army said with a straight face that the reason the World Food Program does n’t send food into Gaza is because its warehouses there are “ full . ”
2. Pretend that your main concern is for your own victims
Bushie examples :
They refused to say that they “ invaded ” or “ conquered ” Iraq , always using the word “ liberation ” when they spoke of their war of aggression .
Bush was not invading and occupying Iraq , he was liberating the long - suffering Iraqis .
Richard Perle even maintained that they would be “ grateful ” for being “ liberated . ”
I.e. , we ’re doing this to you for your own good .
The Bushies renamed the Iraqi guerrilla resistance to the US “ anti-Iraqi forces . ”
They even managed to get some clueless CNN anchors to report that “ anti-Iraqi forces attacked US troops in the Triangle of Death today . ”
The implication was that the US military and its allies were the pro-Iraqi forces .
Kadima : Livni said , “ But Hamas is not our problem alone ; it is also a problem for all the Palestinians in the region . ”
I.e. , Israel is bombing and attacking Gaza on behalf of the Palestinians to secure their welfare .
3 . Demonizing the opponent , ad hominem arguments
Bushies : “ Axis of Evil ” ( courtesy Neocon David Frum ) .
Bush called Saddam a “ threat ” even if he had no weapons !.
Saddam was intrinsically dangerous , ontologically dangerous ; his danger to the US could not be divorced from his very being in existence .
( How silly this all is is easily demonstrated by the Reagan and first Bush administration ’s active alliance with . . . Saddam . )
Israeli pundit : Confronting the depths of Hamas ’s evil .
Hamas won the elections for the Palestine Authority in January 2006 and formed a government ; yet Livni objects even to speaking of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas , because Hamas , she says , is just a terrorist organization .
( It has engaged in terrorist tactics , just as Livni has committed state terror on a large scale , as with dropping a million cluster bombs on civilian areas of south Lebanon ; but Hamas is n’t “ just ” a terrorist organization , or Livni ’s bombing of policemen and the ministry of interior in Gaza would make no sense ; she thinks it was the government of Gaza , obviously .
Hamas has engaged in diplomacy , has called truces , etc .
It is made up of human beings , not demons . )
4. Repetition of simple slogans until they become accepted as true
Bushie examples :
There are so many I do n’t know where to start .
But the repeated innuendo that Saddam Hussein was operationally connection to the 9/11 al - Qaeda attacks on the US is the big example .
The assertion that Iraq had “ weapons of mass destruction ” ( itself a propaganda phrase intended to suggest nukes ) was made over and over again , and Bush , Rice , andothers constantly used “ mushroom cloud ” and other nuclear imagery for Iraq .
Kadima : Israeli leaders have repeated over and over again that they “ had no choice ” but to attack Gaza .
But of course they had a choice .
They had negotiated before , they could have negotiated again .
Assertions that the Palestinians walked away from the 2000 Camp David negotiations , that Israel is involved in a “ peace process ” , that the colonies in the West Bank ca n’t be moved back to Israel , all of these are constantly repeated .
5 . Use of half - truths
Bushie examples : Bush would boast that 2/3s of the al - Qaeda leadership had been killed or captured , without mentioning that many in its upper echelons , like , oh , Osama Bin Laden had not .
Or he slammed the Democrats who had voted against his illegal war of aggression as “ not supporting liberation . ”
Kadima examples : Israelis point to thousands of rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel , without mentioning that no Israelis had been killed by them during the truce stretching from mid-June , 2008 until December 26 .
That is , the prelude to the most violent Israeli attack on Gaza since 1967 was . . . not a single Israeli death at the hands of Hamas in the preceding half - year .
And in 8 years , Hamas had killed about 15 Israelis with those home made rockets , during which time the Israelis had killed nearly 5000 Palestinians , nearly 1000 of them minors .
The rockets were small , handmade affairs for the most part and most landed uselessly .
Some did damage to property and a few wounded or killed people .
That would be a legitimate assertion .
But the quotation of “ thousands ” of rockets is a half - truth and intentionally misleading .
Another half - truth is that Israel is involved in a “ peace process ” or supports Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , when in fact it has gone on stealing Palestinian land in the West Bank and making Palestinian lives miserable and colonizing them .
Then there are other techniques such as 6 ) appeal to fear and 7 ) appeal to prejudice .
Apologists for the attack on Gaza depict Gazans as murderous , jihadi , homophobic , sharia - wielding fanatics , in a word , Muslims , and therefore of course their lives do n’t matter .
Sound familiar ?
Having been treated to these propaganda techniques repeatedly and continuously for 8 years , the US public can suddenly hear the similarity in the assertions of Israeli officialdom and its supporters .
Of course , the Neoconservatives had borrowed a lot of their techniques from the Jabotinsky / Likud tradition of revisionist Zionism , so what goes around comes around .
By the way , since Tzipi Livni admitted Sunday that her government is resisting a diplomatic solution to Gaza and wants to keep the war going as long as possible , and that one impediment is “ the pictures coming out of Gaza ” – i.e. of dead children and civilians and ordinary policemen , I ’ll just put in this link for those with a tough stomach .
Not for the squeamish ( and not an endorsement of the site ) .
Here is another one ; same caveats

In a chilling precedent for economics bloggers around the globe , a South Korean economics blogger was arrested , and charged with “ Spreading false economic information on the internet . ”
If convicted , the Korean economics blogger , could serve 5 years in jail .
Apparently “ Minerva ” , the internet pseudonym for the arrested Mr. Park aka “ economic president of the internet ” , gained a large following by accurately predicting the financial collapse .
“ Minerva ” went too far and committed a crime , according to the judge and reported by the Associated Press , by claiming on an internet discussion board that the South Korean government ” had ordered major financial institutions and trade businesses not to purchase U.S. dollars . ”
His posting “ affected foreign exchange markets and the nation ’s credibility , ” said the judge .
At this time it is impossible to verify whether the accusations are accurate , in any case Mr. Park pleaded not guilty to all charges at his court hearing on Saturday , and is receiving wide spread support in the Korean Blogosphere .
You can show your support for Mr. Park , by sending a message to the Honorable Ambassador of the Republic of Korea Lee Tae-sik , and demand that his government immediately release Mr. Park and respect free speech on the internet .
You can also help to keep the internet free , by supporting the premier internet watchdog group , the “ Electronic Frontier Foundation ” with a much needed donation .
As an economics blogger myself , who also predicted the financial collapse , the ability to share with my readers my thoughts and yes predictions is compromised by the action of the Korean Government .
Economics is all about predicting the future , economists spend half of their time predicting the future , and the other half revising their predictions .
Without predictions there would not be economics .
Thankfully , Mr. Park is receiving backing from the main Korean opposition party as well as from human rights activists , so I predict that Mr. Park will be released shortly .
After , you have contacted the Korean Embassy , of course .
In a show of solidarity with our Korean colleague , the Inspired Economist welcomes you to leave a comment below , with your economic predictions for 2009 .

STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
In the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Nine
AN ACT establishing a permanent state defense force .
Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened :
1 Finding .
The general court finds that a large portion of the New Hampshire national guard has been and is on active duty outside the boundaries of the state and , therefore , finds it prudent to heed the recommendation from the Department of Homeland Security to establish a permanent state defense force by revising the militia statutes relative to the state guard .
2 Authority .
Amend RSA 111:1 to read as follows :
111:1 Authority .
I. [ Whenever any part of the New Hampshire national guard is in the active service of the United States , ]
The governor is hereby authorized and required to organize and maintain within this state [ during such period ] , under such regulations as the Department of Defense of the United States may prescribe for discipline in training , and otherwise in general conformity with existing law , regulations , rules , and practices pertaining to the national guard , [ such ] military forces [ as he may deem necessary ] to defend this state from invasion , rebellion , disaster , insurrection , riot , breach of the peace or imminent danger thereof , or to maintain the organized militia .
II .
The governor [ may ] shall authorize and require the adjutant general ’s department to maintain a cadre of officers and enlisted personnel on a standby basis to prepare and maintain a roster of available personnel and to plan for an active state guard [ in the event of the mobilization of all or a part of the New Hampshire national guard .
The provisions of RSA 541 - A shall not apply to any regulations or proclamations issued pursuant to RSA 111 ] .
The purpose of the state guard shall be the defense of the state : to coordinate the resources of the state and interface between the state and the national guard in time of emergency or natural disaster and to defend the state against invasion .
3 Composition .

No person shall be appointed or enlisted in the state guard who is a member of any other military force of the United States or the state of New Hampshire , or who has any service obligation to any of the armed forces of the United States , except that a retired military member may be appointed or enlisted in the state guard , if otherwise qualified .
II .
The active state guard shall be comprised of those active reserve state guard members called into actual service by the governor of the state .
III .
The active reserve state guard shall be comprised of those citizens of the state who volunteer for service in the active reserve state guard .
Active service in the state guard shall be for a period of one year and members shall be subject to such discipline as is determined by the adjutant general of the state .
IV .(a ) The inactive reserve state guard shall be comprised of all able - bodied residents of the state who are 18 years of age or older , who are , or have declared their intention to become , citizens of the United States , and who are not serving in the national guard or the active reserve state guard or exempt under subparagraph ( b ) unless such exempt person volunteers to serve in the inactive reserve state guard .
Inactive reserve state guard members may participate in any training provided for the active reserve state guard .
Inactive reserve state guard members may hold commissions up to the rank of captain without specific assignment having held equivalent or higher rank in the armed forces of the United States of America or the New Hampshire national guard , or if their training or education qualifies them for such rank , provided that their time in grade shall always be inferior to those of equal rank in the active reserve state guard .
Members of the inactive reserve state guard may volunteer for service in an actual emergency for such period or periods of time as their circumstances will allow .
( b) (1 ) The following persons shall be exempt from inclusion in the inactive reserve state guard :
(A) Elected or appointed officials of the government of the United States of America ;

HB 524-FN - FISCAL NOTE
AN ACT establishing a permanent state defense force .
FISCAL IMPACT :
The Adjutant Generals Department states this bill would have an indeterminable increase on state expenditures in FY 2009 and each year thereafter .
This bill would have no fiscal impact on state revenues or county and local revenue or expenditures .
METHODOLOGY :
The Adjutant Generals Department states this bill establishes a permanent state defense force and removes the exemption from RSA 541 - A for regulations and proclamations issued relative to the state guard .
The Adjutant Generals Department states because this bill does not specify the size of the permanent state defense force , the amount of additional resources such as space , equipment and personnel is indeterminable .
The Department notes this bill would require the hiring of three additional positions to manage the accounting , equipment control , grant management , and surplus and property book responsibilities of the defense force .
The Department estimates the three additional positions required to cost the following :
Position Title FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Accounting Technician ( LG 12 ) Salary $ 26,539 $ 27,515 $ 28,646 $ 29,718 Benefits $ 18,649 $ 20,089 $ 21,668 $ 23,363 Program Assistant II ( LG 15 ) Salary $ 29,718 $ 30,986 $ 32,234 $ 33,540 Benefits $ 19,277 $ 20,775 $ 22,378 $ 24,119 Business Admin .
II ( LG 24 ) Salary $ 42,841 $ 44,753 $ 46,722 $ 48,770 Benefits $ 21,872 $ 23,497 $ 25,242 $ 27,130 Total $ 158,896 $ 167,615 $ 176,890 $ 186,640
Inside , a passive home does have a slightly different gestalt from conventional houses , just as an electric car drives differently from its gas - using cousin .
There is a kind of spaceship - like uniformity of air and temperature .
The air from outside all goes through HEPA filters before entering the rooms .
The cement floor of the basement is n’t cold .
The walls and the air are basically the same temperature .
Look closer and there are technical differences :
When the windows are swung open , you see their layers of glass and gas , as well as the elaborate seals around the edges .
A small , grated duct near the ceiling in the living room brings in clean air .
In the basement there is no furnace , but instead what looks like a giant Styrofoam cooler , containing the heat exchanger .
Passive houses need no human tinkering , but most architects put in a switch with three settings , which can be turned down for vacations , or up to circulate air for a party ( though you can also just open the windows ) .
“ We ’ve found it ’s very important to people that they feel they can influence the system , ” Mr. Hasper said .
The houses may be too radical for those who treasure an experience like drinking hot chocolate in a cold kitchen .
But not for others .
“ I grew up in a great old house that was always 10 degrees too cold , so I knew I wanted to make something different , ” said Georg W. Zielke , who built his first passive house here , for his family , in 2003 and now designs no other kinds of buildings .
In Germany the added construction costs of passive houses are modest and , because of their growing popularity and an ever larger array of attractive off - the - shelf components , are shrinking .
But the sophisticated windows and heat - exchange ventilation systems needed to make passive houses work properly are not readily available in the United States .
So the construction of passive houses in the United States , at least initially , is likely to entail a higher price differential .
Moreover , the kinds of home construction popular in the United States are more difficult to adapt to the standard : residential buildings tend not to have built - in ventilation systems of any kind , and sliding windows are hard to seal .

To really know a subject you 've got to learn a bit of its history .
If that subject is topology , you 've got to read this :
1 ) I. M. James , editor , History of Topology , Elsevier , New York , 1999 .
From a blow - by - blow account of the heroic papers of Poincare to a detailed account by Peter May of the prehistory of stable homotopy theory ... it 's all very fascinating .
You 'll probably want to study some more of the subject by the time you 're done !
In order to satisfy that craving , I want to tell you how to compute some homology groups .
But we 'll do it a strange way : using " q- mathematics " .
I began talking about q-mathematics last week , but now I want to dig deeper .
At first , it looks like there are two really different places where this q-stuff shows up .
One is when you do mathematics with q-deformed quantum groups replacing the Lie groups you know and love - this is important in string theory , knot theory , and loop quantum gravity .
In this case it 's best if q is a unit complex number , especially an nth root of unity :
q = exp ( 2πi/n )
See , in quantum physics problems with a loop group as the symmetry group , these symmetries tend to hold only up to a phase .
The precise way these phases work depends on the parameter q.
Mathematically , this means that instead the loop group itself , the symmetries are really described by a slightly larger group that keeps track of these phases , called a " central extension " of the loop group .
This has led people to spend huge amounts of energy studying representations of central extensions of loop groups - which turn out to be much more economically understood , in a rather subtle way , as representations of quantum groups .
In all this work the parameter q plays a major role .
For more on this try these books :
2 ) Andrew Pressley and Graeme Segal , Loop Groups , Oxford U. Press , Oxford , 1986 .
3 ) Vyjayanathi Chari and Andrew Pressley , A Guide to Quantum Groups , Cambridge U. Press , Cambridge , 1994 .
4 ) Jürgen Fuchs , Affine Lie Algebras and Quantum Groups , Cambridge U. Press , Cambridge , 1992 .
Taken together , they provide a pretty good view of what I 'm talking about .
In case you 're wondering , an " affine Lie algebra " is the Lie algebra of a central extension of a loop group .
Mathematical physicists know all about this sort of q-stuff .
But q-stuff also shows up when we do mathematics with finite fields .
Here I do n't mean " field " in the physics sense - I mean an algebraic gadget where you can add , subtract , multiply and divide !
Physicists are happiest when their field is the real or complex numbers .
But mathematicians also like fields with finitely many elements .
If q is a power of a prime number , there is a unique field with q elements , called F q .
Even better , these are all the finite fields .
If q is itself prime , F q is just the integers mod q .
We can get the other finite fields using a trick very much like how we get the complex numbers from the reals by throwing in the square root of minus one .
Do n't be scared : this is already more than what you 'll need to know about finite fields to understand what I 'm going to say !
And here 's what I 'm going to say : lots of formulas for counting structures on finite sets have q-versions that tell you how to count structures on projective spaces over F q .
Remember , a " projective space " is just the space of all line through the origin in a vector space .
The basic idea is this mystical analogy :
q = 1 FINITE SETS q = a power of a prime number PROJECTIVE SPACES OVER F q
1
Let 's start with some examples .
How many points does an n-element set have ?
Answer : the integer
n
q
qn - 1 [ n ]
=
-------- q - 1 = 1 + q + q2 + ... + qn-1
To see why this answer is right , first note that we determine a line through the origin by picking any nonzero vector .
There are qn - 1 of these .
However , two vectors determine the same line if one is a nonzero multiple of the other , and there are q - 1 nonzero elements of F q .
So , the actual number of lines through the origin is
qn - 1 -------- = [ n ]
q - 1
n! = 1 2 ... n
q
[ n ] ! = [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ... [ n ]
Here 's yet another example .
How many m-element subsets does an n-element set have ?
Answer : the binomial coefficient
n! --------- m! ( n -m ) !
q
[ n ] !
----------- [ m ] ! [ n - m ] !
It goes on and on like this : all sorts of structures that can be defined for finite sets have analogues for the projective geometry of finite fields , and when we count these , the former tend to give us " ordinary mathematics " , while the latter give us " q- mathematics " , which reduces to ordinary mathematics at q = 1 .
Clearly this pattern is trying to tell us something ; the question is what .
As always , it pays to focus on the simplest case , since that 's where everything starts .
I said that the number of lines through the origin in an n-dimensional vector space over the field with q elements is
qn - 1 [ n ]
=
-------- q - 1 = 1 + q + q2 + ... + qn-1
Of course this is just the formula for summing a geometric series , but we can also categorify this formula .
In other words : we can think of [ n ] not as the mere number of lines through the origin in an n-dimensional vector space over F q , but as the actual set of such lines .
To prove the second equation , we should thus find a nice way to write this set as 1 special line , together with q more lines , and then q2 more , and so on .
To do this , pick a maximal flag : a 1d subspace contained in a 2d subspace contained in a 3d subspace ... and so on .
There is one line through the origin contained in our 1d subspace - namely the subspace itself .
There are q lines through the origin contained in the 2d subspace but not in the 1d subspace .
There are q2 lines in the 3d subspace but not the 2d subspace .
And so on .
Voila !
Combinatorists call this a " bijective proof " : a proof that two numbers are equal which actually establishes a bijection between the finite sets they count .
It 's an example of " categorification " because we 've taken an equation and found the isomorphism that explains it - taking us from math in the set of natural numbers to math in the category of finite sets .
The cool part is , this proof works for all fields , not just finite ones .
For example , over the real numbers we can use it to take the projective space RPn - 1 and chop it into pieces like this :
RPn - 1 = R0 + R1 + ... + Rn-1
|RPn - 1 | = ( - 1) 0 + ( - 1 ) 1 + ... + ( - 1 ) n-1 ( - 1 ) n - 1 = ----------- , ( -1 ) - 1
You 'll notice that the Euler characteristic is working here exactly like the cardinality did in the finite field case .
That 's no coincidence !
The Euler characteristic and its evil twin the " homotopy cardinality " are both generalizations of cardinality , as I explained in " week147 " .
If we use Schanuel 's improved version of the Euler characteristic , which lets us chop up a space X and calculate | X| by summing the Euler characteristics of the pieces , we have | R| = - 1 , so
|RPn - 1 | = | R0 + R1 + ... + Rn -1| = | R|0 + | R|1 + ... + | R|n - 1 = [ n ]
What about the complex numbers ?
Well , as spaces we have
C = R2
|C| = | R|2 = 1 .
Now that we 've gotten this wonderful new insight we can test it on fancier examples , like flag manifolds .
I already showed you that the number of maximal flags in an n-dimensional vector space over F q is the q- factorial
[ n ] !
And if you look back , you 'll see I gave a bijective proof .
This means that if we work over the real or complex numbers , the same proof gives a cell decomposition of the manifold of maximal flags in Rn or Cn - the " flag manifold " , for short .
So we can just calculate some q-factorials :
[ 1 ] ! = 1 [ 2 ] ! = 1 + q [ 3 ] ! = 1 + 2 q + 2q2 + q3 [ 4 ] !
= 1 + 3 q + 5q2 + 6q3 + 5q4 + 3q5 + q6
R0 + 3R + 5R2 + 6R3 + 5R4 + 3R5 + R6
C0 + 3C + 5C2 + 6C3 + 5C4 + 3C5 + C6
In particular , the Euler characteristic of the flag manifold in n dimensions is just [ n ] ! , where we set q = - 1 in the real case and q = 1 in the complex case .
But in the complex case we can say more !
Whenever you build a space from cells , you can compute its homology from a chain complex with one generator for each cell and a differential saying how the cells of dimension n are glued to the cells of dimension n - 1 .
But since the complex flag manifold is built from only even - dimensional cells , the differential is zero in this case .
This means you can read off its nth homology group by just counting the number of n-cells !
The homology group is just Zk , where k is this number .
So for example , if some nasty guy demands that you calculate the 10th homology of the complex flag manifold in 4 dimensions , you just tell him " I know it 's a free abelian group ... " and calculate
[ 4 ] ! = 1 ( 1 + q ) ( 1 + q + q2 ) ( 1 + q + q2 + q3 ) = 1 + 3 q + 5q2 + 6q3 + 5q4 + 3q5 + q6
The same sort of trick works for Grassmannians , too .
The Grassmannian Gr( n , k ) is the set of all k - dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space .
This makes sense over any field .
I already said that over the finite field F q , the cardinality of this Grassmannian is the q-binomial coefficient
[ n ] !
| Gr ( n , k ) | = ----------- [ k ] ! [ n -k ] !
So , for example , the Euler characteristic of the manifold of 2 - dimensional subspaces of C4 is the same as the number of ways of choosing 2 elements from a 4 - element set !
A nice example of the unity of mathematics .
Also , since complex Grassmannians are built from only even - dimensional cells , we can read off their homology groups just like we did for complex flag manifolds .
Let 's work out the homology of Gr( 4,2 ) , for example .
We start by working out the q-binomial coefficient :
[ 4 ] !
1 ( 1 + q ) ( 1 + q + q2 ) ( 1 + q + q2 + q3 ) ---------- =
------------------------------------------- [ 2 ] ! [ 2 ] !
1 ( 1 + q ) 1 ( 1 + q ) = 1 + q + 2q2 + q3 + q4
the 0th homology group is Z the 2nd homology group is Z the 4th homology group is Z2 the 6th homology group is Z the 8th homology group is Z
On a lighter note : the best way to simplify this sort of expression
1 ( 1 + q ) ( 1 + q + q2 ) ( 1 + q + q2 + q3 ) ------------------------------------------- 1 ( 1 + q ) 1 ( 1 + q )
1 x 11 x 111 x 1111 111 x 1111 123321 --------------------- =
------------ = ------ = 11211 1 x 11 x 1 x 11 11 11
1 + q + 2q2 + q3 + q4 .
By the way , the cells we 've been counting are called " Schubert cells " .
I 'll quit here for now , but actually this is just the tip of the iceberg .
I 've been talking how q-factorials are related to projective geometry , but as readers of " week178 " , " week180 " and " week181 " will know , there exists a generalization of projective geometry for any simple Lie group .
In fact , for any simple Lie group G and any parabolic subgroup P there is a decomposition of G/P into Schubert cells , and these cells are counted by the coefficients of a certain polynomial in q .
Using these you can massively generalize everything I just told you !
I 'll explain this stuff in future Weeks .
Addendum :
Here 's my reply to a request for clarification from my friend Squark :
Squark wrote : > John Baez wrote : >>

R and C are both contractible , so > it has to be principally different from the usual Euler characteristic !
Right .
Schanuel 's Euler characteristic is not homotopy invariant like the usual Euler characteristic , and it's only defined for nice spaces , like polyhedral sets .
However , it has a great property to make up for these sins : whenever we can chop up a polyhedral set A into nice parts B and C , we have | A| = | B| + |C|
We also have | XxY| = |X| x | Y| , and homeomorphic nice spaces have the same Schanuel Euler characteristic .
One can check that for compact manifolds , the Schanuel Euler characteristic matches the usual one , so my strange calculations really do give the standard " right answers " .
Schanuel 's Euler characteristic of a point is 1 : |*| = 1 so the Schanuel Euler characteristic of the open interval must be - 1 : we have ( 0,1 ) = ( 0,1/2 ) + { 1/2} + ( 1/2,1 ) so if | ( 0,1 ) | = x we have x = x + 1 + x so x = - 1 .
This means that the Schanuel Euler characteristic of a half - open interval is zero : ( 0,1 ] = ( 0,1 ) + { 1 } so | ( 0,1 ] | = | ( 0,1 ) | + |{ 1}| = - 1 + 1 = 0
The Schanuel Euler characteristic of a circle is 0 as well , since we can chop it into two ( or three , or more ) half - open intervals .
The Schanuel Euler characteristic of an open square is 1 : | ( 0,1 ) x ( 0,1 ) | = | ( 0,1 ) | x | ( 0,1 ) | = - 1 x - 1 = 1 and the S - E characteristic of a closed square is 1 x 1 = 1 .
Now , just as a consistency check , write the closed square as the union of an open square and its boundary .
The boundary is homeomorphic to a circle , so we should get 1 + 0 = 1 .
It works !
A good reference on this stuff is : James Propp , Exponentiation and Euler measure , available at http://www.arXiv.org/abs/math.CO/0204009.
Here you 'll see that what I 'm calling Schanuel 's Euler characteristic goes back to work before Schanuel .
Also , if you push it far enough , it gives a fascinating approach to dealing with " sets with negative numbers of elements " - for example , it gives a kind of combinatorial interpretation of identities like - 2 choose 3 = - 4 Schanuel was trying to categorify the integers : that 's why he came up with this stuff .

Everybody immediately responds to subject matter in art .
A picture of a butterfly and a picture of a snake do not get the same response .
In addition to subject matter* , the formal aspects of visual composition are like the grammar of a language .
In writing , a story is written with words - subject matter .
Like good literature and good poetry is more than words and subject matter , art is more than pictures .
The organization , the sentence structure , the style , and so on can make or break a good story .
In art , the way the formal elements are arranged can make or break a good picture idea .
The use of design principles applied to the visual elements is like visual grammar .
When children learn art , it is like learning to read and write the language of vision .
When they develop a style of expressing visual ideas , it helps them become visual poets .
Looking for the visual effects of design principles does not have to limit an artist 's options .
It can focus an artist 's experimentation and choice making .
TEACHING TIP
Art vocabulary can be taught along with every project .
Children can understand terms if the teacher explains them and posts them with illustrations .
Including new art words in the weekly spelling list is a good way to integrate and reinforce new terms .
Six Visual Elements ( art elements )
top of page
We think of the elements as the basic visual material with which to make art .
Is hard to imagine anything visual without the use of one or more of these elements .
We think of the principles as ways to work with and arrange the elements .
Some Design Principles
or design rules ( some creative artists purposely break rules ) top of page
This list is an example list .
Every author seems to have a slightly different list of Principles .
Emphasis - say " Center of Interest . "
It is about dominance and influence .
Most artists put it a bit off center and balance it with some minor themes to maintain our interest .
Some artists avoid emphasis on purpose .
They want all parts of the work to be equally interesting .
Harmony -
As in music , complementary layers and / or effects can be joined to produce a more attractive whole .
The composition is complex , but everything appears to fit with everything else .
The whole is better than the sum of its parts .
. Unity -
When nothing distracts from the whole , you have unity .
Unity without variation can be uninteresting - like driving on a clear day through Western Kansas on the interstate .
Unity with diversity generally has more to offer in both art and in life .
Of course some very minimal art can be very calming and at times even very evocative .
Even a simple landscape can have a powerful effect .
Opposition - uses contrasting visual concepts .
That same Western Kansas " big sky " landscape becomes very dramatic and expressive when a storm builds in the southwest .
Principles can grow out of any artistic device that is used to produce an effect on the viewer .
TEACHING TIP
Children as young as two or three can differentiate differences between rough and smooth , hard and soft , various colors , dark and light , big and little , and other opposites .
Sorting and identification activities help them learn to focus on learning tasks .
If students do some hands - on practice they learn these ideas better than when they asked to observe something shown by a teacher .
Students can be based to do curved and straight , dark and light ( low key - high key ) , open and closed ( in the frame and extending beyond ) , positive and negative ( subject and background ) , soft and hard , smooth and rough , parallel and branching , spiral and concentric , and so on .
After each practice routine , students stop a moment and tell each other how the vocabulary words are being shown .
Balance is the consideration of visual weight and importance .
It is a way to compare the right and left side of a composition .
top of page
© marvin bartel Asymmetrical balance is more interesting .
Above both sides are similar in visual weight but not mirrored .
It is more casual , dynamic , and relaxed feeling so it is often called informal balance .
Radial balance is not very common in artist 's compositions , but it is like a daisy or sunflower with everything arranged around a center .
Rose windows of cathedrals use this design system .
Of course a sunflower can have many meanings and feelings beyond its " radiant " feeling .
Farmers might hate it as weed cutting into their corn production .
On the other hand , many of us can't help thinking about Vincent Van Gogh 's extraordinarily textured painted sunflowers .
Once we have contemplated those thickly expressed colors and textures with their luscious painterly surface , every sunflower we see becomes an aesthetic experience filled with spiritual sensations .
The butterfly below by itself is essentially symmetrical .
Both sides are similar in visual weight and almost mirrored .
Because symmetrical balance often looks more stiff and formal , sometimes it is called formal balance .
Of course a butterfly , even though it is symmetrical , does n't look stiff and formal because we think of fluttering butterflies as metaphors for freedom and spontaneity .
It is a case of subject matter and symbolism overpowering formal design effects .
This is a simple diagram of radial balance .
Variety -
You create variety when elements are changed .
Repeating a similar shape but changing the size can give variety and unity at the same time .
Keeping the same size , but changing the color can also give variety and unity at the same time .
In visual composition , there are many ways you can change something while simultaneously keeping it the same .
Depth - effects of depth , space , projection toward the viewer add interest .
Linear perspective in the real world makes things look smaller in the distance .
Some artists try to avoid depth by making large things duller and small things brighter , and so on , to make the objects contradict realism .
Many artists do n't believe in realism even though they could do it if they wanted to .
It seems too boring to them .
Realism would n't be art for some artists .
Repetition - Some ways to use Repetition of the Visual Elements are :
Size Variation can apply to shape , form , etc .
Notice how size can effect how close or far something can appear to be from the viewer .
top of page
top of page - © marvin bartel
Here the same butterfly is shown twice .
Which one appears closer ?
Note how size relationships create depth or space in a composition .
Children in first grade can already recognize closer and farther based on size even though they would n't typically use this in their pictures unless they were motivated to do so .
Repetition can be used on all of the Visual Elements .
If things are repeated without any change they can quickly get boring .
However , repetition with variation can be both interesting and comfortably familiar .
Repetition gives motion .
Variation can be used with all of the visual elements .
See " Variety " above .
You can do this with all the elements .
Artists do this all the time .
Color saturation , sometimes called " color intensity " or brightness can also give a feeling of depth and space .
Which of these butterflies are farther away ?
Most second graders can see this effect when they are asked to look for it .
These butterflies create the illusion of depth even though they are all the same size .
© marvin bartel TEACHING TIP
By the third grade , most children can reproduce effects like this that they observe in nature if the teacher has them observe these effects in the landscape .
A foggy morning is an excellent time for a lesson in " atmospheric perspective " .
Atmospheric perspective causes colors and shapes to get blurrier and foggier in the distance .
Overlapping is often used by artists to create depth .
Young children try to avoid overlapping in their work .
TEACHING TIP
By first grade if asked , most can explain how overlapping makes some things look closer and other things farther away .

Visual Effects
When we analyze artwork we often start with visual effects .
We notice something happening .
Then we try to figure out why it happens .
top of page
Motion .
Motion is n't a principle .
It is one those magic effects when a still picture has motion .
There are lots of ways to get motion .
MOTION EXAMPLES
Sometimes it has to do with orientation .
A diagonal line is more dynamic than a horizontal or vertical line .
Sometimes motion depends on the character of the element itself .
A straight line may be less dynamic than a zigzag or a curving line .
A blended area may appear to flow .
Depth .
Depth is another magic effect .
Illusion and magic are two threads of the same cloth .
DEPTH EXAMPLES
Sometimes the illusion of depth has to do with orientation .
If you want a chair or person to appear further away , you can place them higher on the picture plane .
Sometimes the illusion of depth depends on the character of the element itself .
A warm color can appear to project and cool color can appear to recede , other things being equal .
A light tone ( value ) can appear to project and dark tone can appear to recede .

Teaching Creative Thinking Habits with this page
HOW CAN TEACHERS GET CREATIVE TEACHING IDEAS ?
Andy Goldsworthy , makes artwork based on Six Elements of Visual Art .
To avoid blocking individual innovative and thinking , what if we show Goldsworthy 's work and discuss it AFTER students have done their own creative work ?
Creative teachers study the work of great artists , inventors , scientists , and so on .
These teachers " reverse engineer " the ideas , creative process , and basic questions the creative experts probably used .
Instead of showing preliminary examples from artists , I often start students with prescribed media practice ( warm- ups ) , ways to experiment ( discover what works ) , ways to generate their own original ideas .
The sequence is described in How to Plan Studio Art Lessons to foster artistic thinking and creativity - starting studio lessons without showing examples and teaching art world connections at the end of the lesson .
If students are stuck , I ask them open questions to jog their thinking , or ask them to try some experiments to see what works best .
Many artists and inventors do many preliminary drawings .
They have learned that when they start to draw they will see many new ideas suggested .

Rahm Emanuel Had 21 Conversations with Blago About Obama ’s Senate Seat
When the news broke about Illinois Governor Blago trying to sell the president - elect ’s senate seat to the highest bidder Barack Obama rather emphatically stated that neither he nor any of his staff had ANY conversations with the corrupt governor .
I will give president - elect Obama the benefit of the doubt about one thing , he himself probably did n’t have any conversations with Blago about his senate seat .
At least directly .
But it is quite obvious that one member of his staff did in fact have conversations with Blago about the seat .
Rahm Emanuel DID contact Blago about Obama ’s seat .
Now there are rumblings that there are taped conversations between Blago and Emanuel , in fact there are 21 conversations that may have been taped .
Are we to believe that all of these conversations were on the level , if so why would there be a need for 21 conversations ?
It sounds like negotiations were going on if you ask me .
Barack Obama ’s senate seat was for sale and Rahm Emanuel made 21 phone calls to the man selling the seat and we are supposed to believe that there was nothing funny going on here ?
So either Barack Obama did n’t know that Rahm Emanuel was contacting Blago behind his back , or he did know and he lied to the American people .
I do n’t know which is worse .
What I do know is that Rahm Emanuel needs to resign as the president - elect ’s chief of staff .
President - elect Obama ’s first post election decision was a bad one .
So much for the “ good judgement ” that he ran on .
MINNEAPOLIS , Minnesota ( CNN ) -- Democrat Al Franken declared victory in the hotly contested Minnesota Senate race Monday , saying the win is " incredibly humbling . "
A Minnesota board says Al Franken won his U.S. Senate race against Norm Coleman by 225 votes .
The Minnesota State Canvassing Board on Monday certified the results of the recount of Republican Sen. Norm Coleman 's fight to retain his seat against Franken .
The results showed Franken with a 225 - vote lead .
" I am proud to stand before you as the next senator from Minnesota , " Franken told reporters Monday night .
" It 's clear that we have a lot of important work to do ... I 'm ready to go to Washington and get to work as soon as possible . "
Coleman 's attorney , Tony Trimble , said shortly after the ruling that the campaign will officially file a lawsuit .
The Minnesota Republican 's campaign later announced that he will make a public statement on Tuesday afternoon .
Coleman 's campaign contends the recount should have included about 650 absentee ballots it says were improperly rejected in the initial count .
Watch Coleman say he will take his fight to the courts »
The initial count from the November 4 election put Coleman , a first - term senator , 215 votes ahead of Franken , who is known for his stint on NBC's " Saturday Night Live " and as a former talk - show host on progressive radio network Air America .
In Washington , the Senate 's majority and minority leaders staked out opposing positions on the matter of who will serve Minnesota alongside Democrat Amy Klobuchar .
" There comes a time when you have to acknowledge that the race is over , " Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , told reporters .
" The race in Minnesota 's over .
Now it 's only a little finger - pointing .
The certification by the canvassing board , which has been in process for a number of weeks , now clearly shows that Al Franken has won . "
Reid added later : " Coleman will never ever serve in the Senate .
He 's lost the election .
He can stall things , but he 'll never serve in the Senate . "
Watch Reid call on Coleman to concede the race »
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , said : " The law in Minnesota requires certification from the secretary of state and that can't happen until the conclusion of all legal battles .
It 's not over . "
Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan echoed McConnell 's criticism .
" The efforts of Al Franken , Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer to steal this election and seat Al Franken despite not having an election certificate are unprecedented , " Duncan said in a statement .
" I am confident that if the law is followed , Norm Coleman will be taking his rightful seat in the U.S. Senate . "
Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , has pledged a GOP filibuster if the Democratic - controlled Senate attempts to seat Franken before all legal battles play out and before Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , a Republican , can co-sign Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie 's certificate .
Reid said there would be no effort to seat Franken on Tuesday , the day new senators will be sworn in .
Meanwhile , in a move that leaves a post-election legal challenge the last hope for Coleman , Minnesota 's high court earlier Monday denied his campaign 's request to consider about 650 additional rejected absentee ballots .
His attorneys had said those ballots should have been included in the count of mistakenly rejected ballots that were tallied over the weekend .
The Coleman campaign also said Monday that there was no uniform standard for local officials and campaigns to review and tabulate these improperly rejected ballots .
Previously , the court had ordered that only ballots that local officials and both campaigns could agree were rejected in error could be counted .
A consensus was met on about 950 of 1,350 originally found by local officials .
The court ruling suggested Coleman 's latest request should be a post-election consideration .
The Coleman campaign , meanwhile , said it was determined to take the question to court .
" Today 's ruling , which effectively disregards the votes of hundreds of Minnesotans , ensures that an election contest is now inevitable , " said Coleman attorney Fritz Knaak .
" The Coleman campaign has consistently and continually fought to have every validly cast vote counted , and for the integrity of Minnesota 's election system , we will not stop now .
The Minnesota Supreme Court has made sure that an election contest will need to be filed quickly in order to ensure that an accurate and valid recount can be achieved . "
Coleman , who just finished his first term as senator , led Franken by 206 votes at the end of the original vote count in November .
The margin automatically triggered the recount , which was hampered by multiple challenges from both sides .
Coleman switched to the Republican Party from the Democratic - Farmer - Labor Party , which Franken now represents , in 1996 , after two years as St. Paul 's mayor .

WASHINGTON - The House of Representatives approved an $ 819 billion economic - stimulus package by a largely party - line vote yesterday , extending an early legislative victory to President Obama while failing to follow his pledge to preside over a new era of bipartisan consensus .
The bill passed by a vote of 244 to 188 , with no Republican support and 11 Democrats voting against it .
Members of both parties said that despite Obama 's overtures to Republicans - including a trip this week to Capitol Hill to woo members in person - the congressional leadership of both parties approached the stimulus legislation with the same unrelenting partisan tactics Obama attacked during his campaign and inaugural address .
" It 's really not a bipartisan process so I do n't think you can expect a bipartisan vote , " said Representative Jeff Flake , an Arizona Republican .
" If the president had his druthers , we would be included .
. . .
But they 've locked us out .
We 've seen a very heavy - handed leadership on this . "
Yesterday 's vote to approve the package of $ 275 billion in individual and business tax cuts and $ 544 billion in new spending - too much spending , according to the Republican minority - showed that Obama could get his way on major issues without the type of cross -party support he had hoped to get on a bill he has described as crucial to the country 's economic recovery .
Yet if Obama hoped to win
Re publican backing for future proposals , legislators said , he would have to push the Democratic leadership to be more accommodating to the minority party .
" You can't fault Barack for not reaching out .
He 's reached out certainly more than any president in modern history , " said Representative Jim Cooper , a conservative Tennessee Democrat who voted against the bill .
" You 'll gradually see the leadership being more inclusive and bipartisan , but Barack is leading the way .
. . .
It might not succeed on the first engagement , but it will pay off in the future . "
The bill , which includes new funding for food stamps , digital health records , and new energy technologies , among many other provisions , will move on to the Senate , where it could grow to more than $ 1 trillion by the time it comes up for a likely vote next week .
Legislators remained optimistic that a final version of the legislation could reach the White House by the time Congress plans to adjourn for its Presidents '
Day recess in mid-February .
" I hope that we can continue to strengthen this plan before it gets to my desk , " Obama said in a statement minutes after passage .
" But what we can't do is drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way . "
House Republican leaders proved successful at rallying their shrunken minority to stand united against a bill they described as too wasteful , built around traditional Democratic fiscal priorities unrelated to economic recovery .
Eleven Democrats , primarily from conservative rural districts , joined them .
Opinion
Church and state :
The issue of Prop . 8
Proposition 8 has passed , denying to some the right enjoyed by other citizens in California , the right to marry .
Now , the central question for the courts to decide is :
Are gays in California equal , or can members of certain churches declare them constitutionally inferior ?
The approval of a constitutional ban on gay marriage raises troubling but age - old issues concerning the lines between religion and government .
Before the founders of our country separated church and state , there were hundreds of years of turmoil caused by one religion dominating the government and using it against nonbelievers .
In the aftermath of Tuesday 's vote , do gays and lesbians in California have a reason to believe that they have been abused , discriminated against and relegated to a separate - but - equal status ?
Yes , and that 's why this fight is far from over .
There will be a challenge under the U.S. Constitution .
In the 1960s , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a California constitutional amendment that limited fair housing on the grounds that prejudice could not be put into a state Constitution .
No one can forecast the outcome of this next fight , but there is bound to be some fallout that may harm those religions that so vehemently insisted that their beliefs be placed in the California Constitution .
All religions require tolerance to flourish , but in Proposition 8 some religious groups aimed at and wounded gay people in California .
The drafters of the U.S. Constitution had a brilliant , experienced view concerning the importance of drawing the lines to protect religion on the one hand and civil government on the other .
They put those lines in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
Today , those lines are very relevant .
Government may not attack religion .
Californians who have religious beliefs concerning the proper scope of marriage may exercise those rights as they see fit .
Churches have always been able to proceed as they wish concerning marriage ceremonies .
There was no mandate to suppress religious beliefs .
This should be obvious to everyone in California because of our tolerance of all religions .
That the supporters of Proposition 8 were motivated by religious beliefs cannot be denied .
Now the religious beliefs of some Californians are in our Constitution and , until overturned , govern us all whether we like it or not .
The other branch of the First Amendment is equally important .
The state may not establish a religion .
The state may not take principles of religious belief from a religion , any religion , and establish it as the law applicable to all .
This line establishing the double branch of protection of religion on the one hand and no establishment on the other was arrived at after hundreds of years of turmoil .
Historically , marriage was used as a method of oppressing a despised group .
These lessons of history are relevant to reflect on today .
In Ireland , for 150 years , the penal laws provided that no Protestant could marry a Catholic .
Much more recent in the United States were the rules against marriage between a black person and a white person .
These were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1960s and the California Supreme Court in the 1940s .
Using the civil marriage ceremony as a method of expressing governmental disdain toward a particular group is as old as the Sierra Nevada .
It has been an assault on tolerance .
Finally , marriage is a fundamental right in constitutional analysis .
There are very few things in life more important than the ability to choose one 's partner .
Marriage is not just a word ; it is a status , a state of mind , a way of being .
Look in any direction and you will see examples of the people 's respect for the institution of marriage .
A large group of Californians has now been denied that fundamental institution .
These folks are our neighbors , our friends , our colleagues and our relatives .
The constitutional promise of this state is , as the California Supreme Court held , that they are equally protected in the enjoyment of rights by all Californians .
But the voters have spoken .
Now it will be up to the courts to explain whether equality is real - or just an illusion .
I would not wish to be the one to justify this vote to a gay woman going to Afghanistan in the military , to a gay police officer who risks everything so we may be safe or any of the other thousands of gays and lesbians in California who contribute so much to our culture , our advancement and our well being .
I cannot square this vote with my view that Californians are decent , accepting and tolerant .
But I know that the gays and lesbians of California , like the oppressed Catholics of Ireland who lived under penal laws , will fight this visible , constitutional , embarrassing injustice until it is no more .
And when that day comes , we will live in a better state .
Obama energy plan could include solar satellites John Byrne
Published : Friday December 12 , 2008
Print This Email
This A not - yet - refined technology is " on the table " as part of President - Elect Barack Obama 's plan for American energy independence -- solar collecting satellites that beam power back to earth .
The idea of solar power generating satellites recently appeared on Obama 's transition website change.gov .
Obama officials have n't publicly embraced the concept , and the change.gov site is aimed at being a place for Americans to " have a place at the table , " but the technology has been given serious enough treatment to warrant mainstream media attention .
" Beaming solar power from space back to Earth using lasers or microwaves is still a far - out idea , requiring advances in technology and cost reductions that are far from certain and , in any case , likely to take decades to develop , " the Wall Street Journal noted Friday .
There are legions of skeptics , and Obama transition officials havent officially embraced the solar - power initiative .
" But some transition team members are known to look favorably on the general idea , " the paper added .
" A spokesman for the transition didnt respond to email requests for comment . "
Real - world tests are years away , and the technology could take decades to develop .
But the idea has received favorable attention from Pentagon space officials and the Space Frontier Foundation .
While more expensive than conventional power generation , the technology would allow for emergency power in combat zones and areas affected by natural disasters .
" The concept of using lasers to connect satellites to the ground may have a science - fiction connotation , but European and American scientists have shown the feasibility in laboratories for years , " the Journal adds .
" The Pentagon wont confirm widespread industry reports that it already has tested some prototype laser links between orbiting satellites .
By 2020 or so , the militarys internal plans project using lasers to zap data at high transmission rates from satellites in space to various ground receivers . "
Orbital solar satellites would be extraordinarily expensive , but could become viable should the cost of fossil fuels skyrocket or the demand for renewable energy sources -- with respect to climate change -- becomes imperative .
Last year , the president of the tiny Pacific island country of Palau said he'd be interested in being a testbed for solar satellite discoveries .
" An entrepreneur , Kevin Reed , is proposing a very small demonstration satellite in low earth orbit that would be able to beam enough power down as it passes over every day to power 1,000 homes , " Wired reported last December .
" The beam would at first be sent to a power station on one of Palau 's uninhabited islands and provide direct current that could be used to charge batteries .
He is currently looking for the $ 800 million he would need to fully fund the project .
Wired adds : " Larger systems could be placed in geosynchronous orbit that stay over a single point on Earth continuously and beam down 5 gigawatts of power ( as the AP article puts it , " twice the output of the Hoover Dam " ) .
The power would be converted to microwaves for beaming down to Earth .
The beams would be " no more powerful than the energy emanating from a microwave oven 's door . "
In Japan , now back in recession , the economic situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse in recent months .
But the Japanese still like to use their money to have fun , as Duncan Bartlett has been finding out .
Japan 's cat cafes lay on luxury accommodation for their felines
In pictures
Lola - or Rora - to give her a slightly more Japanese pronunciation - is a beauty and she knows it .
Customers pay by the hour for her company .
Usually they just want to stroke her , but as a special treat for favoured clients , she will lie back in a chair , close her eyes and pose for photographs .
Lola is a Persian cat who works at the Ja La La Cafe in Tokyo's bustling Akihabara district .
It is one of a growing number of Cat Cafes in the city which provide visitors with short but intimate encounters with professional pets .
When I called , there were 12 felines and seven customers , mostly single men .
One man , in his early 30s , was attempting to bond with an Oriental Longhair by means of a rubber mouse .
Yutsuke , who speaks with a lisp , is normally rather shy with people .
He longs for a cat of his own but frequent business trips make that difficult .
Besides , he lives alone , so the Ja La La is his solution to the problem .
The right pet
It costs about £ 8 ( $ 10 ) an hour to spend time in a Cat Cafe .
Busy lives mean some people prefer to hire a dog
If felines do not appeal , other establishments will rent you a rabbit , a ferret or even a beetle .
There are more than 150 companies in Tokyo which are licensed to hire out animals of various kinds and although beetles may be cheap , dogs are much more popular .
First you pay a deposit and a hire fee .
Then you are issued with a leash , some tissues and a plastic bag and given some advice on how to handle your new friend .
Kaori is a pretty waitress who regularly spends her Sunday afternoons with a Labrador .
They go for a walk in the park if the weather is fine , or if it is wet they just snuggle up in front of the TV in her apartment .
" When I look into his eyes , I think he's my dog , " Kaori told me .
" But when I take him back to the shop , he runs away from me and starts wagging his tail when he sees the next customer .
That 's when I know he 's only a rental dog . "
Every need considered
Of course , it is not only animals whose loyalties can be decided by money , as people who work in Japan 's vast entertainment business will testify .
Some single women hire men to help with their children 's homework
The industry offers an enormous variety of opportunities to exchange money for company .
Very popular at the moment is the Campus Cafe , where men go to socialise with female university students .
It is cheaper than the upscale hostess clubs in which businessmen and politicians drink whisky with women in kimonos , although that is a business which is in crisis because of the recession .
Only a small proportion of the trade involves sex .
Most hostesses are flatterers not prostitutes and customers come to find comfort in their words , not in their arms .
One specialist agency is known as Hagemashi Tai , which translates as I Want To Cheer Up Limited .
It rents relatives .
Actors are despatched to play the part of distant relations at weddings and funerals .
For an extra fee , they will even give a speech .
But the firm 's services do not stop there .
It can also provide temporary husbands to single mothers who want them .
The website says the " dad " will help the children with their homework .
He will sort out problems with the neighbours .
He will take the kids to a barbeque or to a park .
He could also appear at the daunting interview with a nursery school head teacher which parents are required to endure in order to persuade the principal to give their child a good start in life .
Cry for help
There is a service for women who are about to wed too .
Apparently , they can practise for married life with a hired husband , although whether this involves seduction or sock washing is not exactly clear .
And if things are not working out with a real husband , a woman considering a divorce may choose to hire a " mother " in order to discuss her marital anxieties .
Mr M O from Shizuoka near Mount Fuji called upon the services of I Want To Cheer Up Ltd because he needed a father .
Mr M O has been blind since birth and had a number of concerns that he felt he could not speak to others about .
" I kept it all inside and could n't deal with the criticisms that had been directed at me by my parents and teachers , " he testified .
After some discussion , the company sent an older man to have dinner with him .
" Usually I can't open up when I meet someone for the first time but on that occasion , I felt I was really talking with a normal father .
I 'll use the service again , " he said .
Loneliness is a problem faced by many people on these crowded islands .
But the Japanese are prone to believe that , in the right circumstances , money can turn a stranger into a friend ... at least for a couple of hours .

Allegations about Israeli or Hamas abuses during the conflict in Gaza need to be investigated , David Miliband told MPs today .
In a statement on the Gaza crisis , the foreign secretary said more than 800 Palestinians had been killed , " apparently 250 of them children – the most terrible statistic of all " .
He reiterated the government 's demands for an immediate ceasefire and said allegations of war crimes needed to be properly investigated .
" Extremely serious allegations about the conduct of both sides have been made by the International Committee of the Red Cross and others , " he said .
" These allegations must be properly investigated . "
Miliband said Britain wanted the UN to produce a " loud , clear , unified " message and that this was achieved when the security council passed a resolution last week demanding an immediate ceasefire .
He did not comment on the US decision to abstain when the security council voted .
However , the resolution was followed " within hours by its rejection by both sides of the conflict " , he said .
Miliband spelled out three priorities for the international community .
First , he said , relief was needed for the " desperate humanitarian situation " in Gaza .
Britain had already increased its aid budget by $ 10 m ( £ 6.7 m ) since the conflict began , he added .
" The international aid agencies need the wholehearted cooperation of the Israeli government .
I urge the Israeli government to provide it , " he said .
Secondly , there had to be " security improvements , above all a curb on the trafficking of illegal arms in to Gaza " .
Thirdly , there had to be " a political imperative to re-establish the unity of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestinian Authority " .
Miliband said the Israelis had argued against last week 's UN security council resolution on the grounds that it could not accept an equivalence between a democratic state and a terrorist organisation .
" There is and can be no equivalence .
Hamas have shown themselves over a number of years ready to be murderous in word and deed .
Their motif is ' resistance ' and their method includes terrorism , " Miliband said .
" Israel is meanwhile a thriving , democratic state with independent judiciary . "
" But one consequence of the distinction between a democratic government and a terrorist organisation is that democratic governments are held to significantly higher standards , notably by their own people .
" That is one reason we supported Resolution 1860 – to uphold the standards on which Israel and the rest of us depend .
" As a beacon of democracy in the Middle East , Israel 's best defence is to show leadership in finding a political solution to this crisis and to comply with the standards of international humanitarian law . "
Miliband continued : " Peace benefits Israelis and Palestinians ; war kills both .
They are destined to live next door to each other .
" They can either do so as combatants or as neighbours .
We are committed to help them do the latter .
That is what Israelis need and Palestinians need – it's also what we need – before it is too late . "
The foreign secretary 's statement did not spell out which allegations he wanted to see investigated , although the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel and Israeli responses resulting in the deaths of civilians have been condemned as breaches of humanitarian law .
Science is mostly an incremental process , a slow peeling of the onion to offer small glimpses of understanding .
But over time , scientists remove enough layers to expose stunning truths about nature .
This year offered some intriguing revelations along these lines .
Below are the top 5 .
( And check out 2008 's top astronomy and spaceflight stories , too . )
5 . Stronger link between birds and dinosaurs
Paleontologists have long known that modern birds are the closest living relatives of the long - gone dinosaurs .
But just how the transition between dino and Big Bird happened has not been fully understood .
This year , scientists uncovered more fascinating new links between ancient dinosaurs and their living feathered friends , which emerged some 150 million years ago during the Jurassic Period .
In November , scientists announced the discovery of a fossilized dinosaur nest that proves dinosaurs were forming bird - like nests and laying eggs long before birds evolved .
Another link was established in October , when paleontologists announced the discovery of a fossilized dinosaur that apparently sported tail feathers thought to have helped the creature balance on tree branches .
Though the creature could n't fly , it may represent a step in the direction of feathers for flight .
And a third analysis of fossils revealed that a huge carnivorous dinosaur called Aerosteon had a breathing system much like that of today 's birds , with hollow bones that filled with air and possible air sacs that would have pumped air through its lungs .
4. Memory 's limit found
Common knowledge — and phone number conventions — have held that people can fit about seven things in short - term memory .
But research announced this April found that the true fundamental limit , when all memory aids are taken out of the equation , is actually about three or four .
Psychologists presented subjects with an array of colored squares , then showed a single colored square and asked people to recall if it was the same color as the original square in its position .
The scientists used a mathematical model that assumed people could only remember three or four squares , and found that it accurately predicted the spread of results on the test .
The research does n't mean we should reduce phone numbers to four digits , though .
In most real - life situations , we can use memory tricks , such as grouping items together ( i.e. breaking phone numbers into a chunk of three digits plus a group of four ) to improve on our brain 's minimal capacity .
3 . Huge new population of gorillas discovered
The critically endangered western lowland gorilla has been nearing extinction due to disease , hunting and deforestation .
Until recently , scientists had put the number living in the wild at about 50,000 .
But this August , the Wildlife Conservation Society announced its scientists had uncovered a previously unknown population of about 125,000 gorillas living in the Republic of Congo .
The discovery was a welcome bit of good news for the beleaguered apes , and conservationists say it means their efforts have been working .
But gorillas are n’t out of the woods yet .
They still face imminent threats , especially from the deadly Ebola virus , which has decimated many gorilla populations .
2. Electron filmed for the first time
In a motion - picture first , scientists caught the movement of a single electron on film .
The discovery , announced in February , was made possible with a new technology that generates extremely short pulses of intense laser light to illuminate the particle .
The resulting movie shows an electron leaving an atom after being excited by ultraviolet light .
Since this actually happened in much less time than a second , the sequence was slowed down for human eyes to last a full three seconds .
The groundbreaking achievement should open up doors for new study into the workings of atoms , not to mention a new genre of film : subatomic cinema .
1. The Arctic melts
A piece of the year 's most sobering news is also some of its most significant .
In September , Arctic sea ice reached the second - lowest level recorded since the beginning of the satellite era , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado .
When stacked next to 2007 's ultimate record low , the picture is grim : Global warming 's effects are before us .
The news also spelled disaster for polar bears , whose primary habitat is sea ice .
In May the Interior Department officially listed the polar bear as a threatened species .
Officials said the decline of Arctic sea ice off Alaska and Canada could result in two - thirds of polar bears disappearing by 2050 .

Officials of Barack Obama 's administration have drafted a letter to Iran from the president aimed at unfreezing US - Iranian relations and opening the way for face - to - face talks , the Guardian has learned .
The US state department has been working on drafts of the letter since Obama was elected on 4 November last year .
It is in reply to a lengthy letter of congratulations sent by the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , on 6 November .
Diplomats said Obama 's letter would be a symbolic gesture to mark a change in tone from the hostile one adopted by the Bush administration , which portrayed Iran as part of an " axis of evil " .
It would be intended to allay the ­suspicions of Iran 's leaders and pave the way for Obama to engage them directly , a break with past policy .
State department officials have composed at least three drafts of the letter , which gives assurances that Washington does not want to overthrow the Islamic regime , but merely seeks a change in its behaviour .
The letter would be addressed to the Iranian people and sent directly to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , or released as an open letter .
One draft proposal suggests that Iran should compare its relatively low standard of living with that of some of its more prosperous neighbours , and contemplate the benefits of losing its pariah status in the west .
Although the tone is conciliatory , it also calls on Iran to end what the US calls state sponsorship of terrorism .
The letter is being considered by the new secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , as part of a sweeping review of US policy on Iran .
A decision on sending it is not expected until the review is complete .
In an interview on Monday with the al - Arabiya television network , Obama hinted at a more friendly approach towards the Islamic Republic .
Ahmadinejad said yesterday that he was waiting patiently to see what the Obama administration would come up with .
" We will listen to the statements closely , we will carefully study their actions , and , if there are real changes , we will welcome it , " he said .
Ahmadinejad , who confirmed that he would stand for election again in June , said it was unclear whether the Obama administration was intent on just a shift in tactics or was seeking fundamental change .
He called on Washington to apologise for its actions against Iran over the past 60 years , including US support for a 1953 coup that ousted the democratically elected government , and the US shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 .
The state department refused to comment yesterday on the draft letters .
US concern about Iran mainly centres on its uranium enrichment programme , which Washington claims is intended to provide the country with a nuclear weapons capability .
Iran claims the programme is for civilian purposes .
The diplomatic moves are given increased urgency by fears that Israel might take unilateral action to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities .
The scale of the problem facing the new American president was reinforced yesterday when a senior aide to Ahmadinejad , Aliakbar Javanfekr , said that , despite the calls from the US , Iran had no intention of stopping its nuclear activities .
When asked about a UN resolution calling for the suspension of Iran 's uranium enrichment , Javanfekr , the presidential adviser for press affairs , replied : " We are past that stage . "
One of the chief Iranian concerns revolves around suspicion that the US is engaged in covert action aimed at regime change , including support for separatist groups in areas such as Kurdistan , Sistan - Baluchestan and Khuzestan .
The state department has repeatedly denied that there is any American support for such groups .
In its dying days , the Bush administration was planning to open a US interests section in the Iranian capital Tehran , one step down from an embassy .
Bush 's secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said that never happened because attention was diverted by the Russian invasion of Georgia .
Others say that rightwingers in the Bush administration mounted a rearguard action to block it .
The idea has resurfaced , but if there are direct talks with Iran , it may be decided that a diplomatic presence would obviate the need for a diplomatic mission there , at least in the short term .
While Obama is taking the lead on policy towards Iran , the administration will soon announce that Dennis Ross will become a special envoy to the country , following the appointments last week of George Mitchell , the veteran US mediator , as special envoy to the Middle East , and Richard Holbrooke , who helped to broker the Bosnia peace agreement , as special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Ross , who took a leading role in the Middle East peace talks in Bill Clinton 's administration , will be responsible on a day - to - day basis for implementing policy towards Iran .
In a graphic sign of Iranian mistrust , the hardline newspaper Kayhan , which is considered close to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has denounced Ross as a " Zionist lobbyist " .
Saeed Leylaz , a Tehran - based analyst , said a US letter would have to be accompanied by security guarantees and an agreement to drop economic sanctions .
" If they send such a letter it will be a very significant step towards better ties , but they should be careful in not thinking Tehran will respond immediately , " he said .
" There will be disputes inside the system about such a letter .
There are lot of radicals who do n't want to see ordinary relations between Tehran and Washington .
To convince Iran , they should send a very clear message that they are not going to try to destroy the regime . "
TOKYO , Jan. 25 ( UPI ) --
Tokyo police allege a woman unlawfully entered a neighbor 's apartment to charge her cell phone and then stabbed the occupant with a knife .
The legal resident of the apartment , whose name was not released , said she came home Saturday to find someone else 's cell phone in her charger , Kyodo News Agency reported Sunday .

The resident alleged Michiko Hiroya , 34 , dropped by later to claim the cell phone and then stabbed her in the hand when she tried to call police .
The alleged victim , who is in her 20s , was not seriously wounded .
Hiroya reportedly told police she need to borrow the battery charger because she was having financial difficulties , Kyodo reported .
Hiroya allegedly gained entrance to the apartment with a copy of her neighbor 's key , which she had duplicated after construction workers left it in the neighbor 's mailbox last year , police said .
The Barack Obama administration is preparing to appoint a " full - time , high - level " envoy to address the conflict in Darfur , according to the actor George Clooney , who met the president and Joe Biden in Washington on Monday to lobby them on the issue .
Clooney said Obama and the vice - president had told him the envoy would report directly to the White House , and would be appointed following a foreign policy review currently taking place " at the senior - most levels " .
" They assured me , and wanted to assure the rest – whoever else is listening – this is high on their agenda , " he said .
" This is a huge policy step for us . "
Clooney has campaigned for several years for greater US activism to end the conflict between rebels and Sudanese authorities in Darfur , which may have claimed 300,000 lives and displaced 2.7 million people , according to United Nations estimates .
The international criminal court is due to decide next week whether to issue an arrest warrant for the Sudanese president , Omar al - Bashir , on war crimes charges .
" This is n't about needing American dollars .
I understand that it's a very difficult time , " Clooney said after his scheduled meeting with Biden and a separate , impromptu encounter with Obama .
" It 's not about needing American troops .
It 's about needing what we do best – what we have done best since the start of this country – which is good , robust diplomacy all across the world . "
The actor , who missed Sunday night 's Oscars ceremony for his White House appointment , is a UN messenger for peace , although this did not prevent the UN from revoking his security escort on a visit this month to eastern Chad , where he was touring refugee camps in the company of the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof .
" If the UN is too craven to protect its own goodwill ambassadors – because they might criticise genocide – it's not surprising that it and the international community fail to protect hundreds of thousands of voiceless Darfuris , " Kristof wrote .
Elizabeth Alexander , a Biden spokeswoman , said : " The vice - president informed Mr Clooney about the administration 's ongoing review of Sudan policy and welcomed his observations from his trip , [ and ] thanked Mr Clooney for his work on this issue , which he believes is an important contribution to the public 's understanding of the conflict in Darfur . "
The actor brought with him to the White House 250,000 postcards signed by Americans urging more US action on Darfur .
" I think somehow we should all know that these people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth , " he told CNN .

Politico reports that the RNC spent an additional $ 30,000 on clothes and accessories for Sarah Palin and her family late in the campaign , in addition to the $ 150,000 previously reported .
Take a look at where the money was spent :
The RNC ’s post - Election Day report documented another $ 30,000 at outlets that read like a suburban shopping directory .
Dick ’s Sporting Goods , The Limited , Foot Locker , Wal - Mart , Toys R Us and Victoria ’s Secret are all listed in between the expected payments for media buys , direct mail and polling .
Sporting goods ?
Toys ?
Lingerie ?
In what conceivable way could these expenses be related to the campaign ?
I think it ’s a bit excessive that Palin ’s traveling makeup artist got paid $ 68,400 for roughly three months of work , and that her hair stylist got paid more than $ 42,000 for about two , but at least those expenses have a bearing on how Palin looked in rallies , interviews , and other campaign - related activities .
What does Victoria ’s Secret sell that was relevant to the campaign ?
A little bit late to the party , but maybe someone have n’t seen it yet and it ’s definitelly something worth witnessing .
Folks creating demos on “ smaller ” platforms ( mainly C64 & Atari ) just seem to refuse to acknowledge that golden years are gone .
What ’s cool , in many cases they manage to “ bend ” the reality and create stuff that simply should n’t be possible .
Poster example is relatively fresh demo - Edge of Disgrace by Booze Design ( winner of X 2008 ) .
Production of this little gem spanned over period of 7 years ( see detailed development notes ) !
True labour of love .
Single effects may not be that breathtaking if you ’re familiar with latest C64 release ( even if almost every of them is an improvement over existing ) , but the overall feeling is just flawless + they ’re silky smooth .
Music , the way different demo parts link with each other ( usually , you have to fight to get memory even for the effect itself , forget about transitions ) , graphics , all top notch ( watch this video if you want to hear crowd ’s reaction ) .
There ’s plenty of demos with great code ( in fact , watch whole top 4 from X2008 , “ credits ” effect from Natural Wonders 2 is just sick , Numen [ Atari ] is another example ) , but EoD is a rare example of amazing code , graphics , music and design mixed together .
I wonder what would Jack Tramiel say after watching this .
John Rockefeller 2009-01-26 02:51:50
Great demos , thanks for the links .
Stephen 2009-01-26 07:26:30
This is absolutely UNBELIEVABLE !
They did this with a C64 ?
With 64 k of barely available memory ?
( What I want to know is whether they had to use another computer to help them write the machine code that did all this funky stuff . )
The C64 will NEVER die !
Hooray !
Somebody tell Microsoft .
I think they could learn something about efficient coding from these guys .

AFAIR , most of todays C64 demos is done using cross compilers , but they all run on old , original hardware .
Gynvael Coldwind 2009-01-26 10:12:50
Woaaah … .
Pure power …
I ’m out of word huh , just great ;>
I ’m surprided that this would run on a real hardware of C64 … 64 kb of memory OK , but CPU ?
What was it ?
1 MhZ ?
Huh … unbelievable ;>
Tim 2009-01-26 22:11:42
Why ?
I ’ll admit that is some highly impressive assembly skill displayed , but the question remains …
Why ?

( CNN ) -- Barack Obama 's inauguration as the 44th U.S. President has been accompanied by celebrations around the world .
People celebrate in Kisumu , Kenya , following President Obama 's inauguration more photos »
In Kogelo , Kenya , the birthplace of Obama 's father , villagers danced and sang in praise of the man they call " Our Son " with the many tourists , local and national , who had traveled to be there for the event .
From London , England to Seoul , South Korea , U.S. expats and local citizens watched live streams of the ceremony in bars , restaurants and community halls .
Troops in Forward Operating Base Kalsu , south of Baghdad , gathered in the dining hall to watch the proceedings .
U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Beverlee Burton of Cleveland , Ohio , cried and applauded as President Obama was inaugurated .
In Japan , people partied in the city of Obama , and in Paris , France , expats gathered at a bar to watch the historic inauguration .
But in Iran , the atmosphere was muted : local media have remained silent on the inauguration itself .
While in some cases a child with ADHD cannot function without medication , there is growing concern about the health risks and side effects associated with the common ADHD medications , including mood swings , insomnia , tics , slowed growth and heart problems .
In 2006 the FDA required manufacturers to place warning labels on ADHD medications , listing the potential serious health risks .
These high risks and growing concerns are fueling parents ' search for alternatives that may be safer for their kids .
The Transcendental Meditation technique may be an effective and safe non-pharmaceutical aid for treating ADHD , according to a study published in Current Issues in Education .
The pilot study followed a group of middle school students with ADHD who were meditating twice a day in school .
After three months , researchers found over 50 percent reduction in stress and anxiety and improvements in ADHD symptoms .
"
The effect was much greater than we expected , " said Sarina J. Grosswald , Ed.D. , a George Washington University - trained cognitive learning specialist and lead researcher on the study .
" The children also showed improvements in attention , working memory , organization , and behavior regulation .
" Grosswald said that after the in - school meditation routine began , " teachers reported they were able to teach more , and students were able to learn more because they were less stressed and anxious .
" Prior research shows ADHD children have slower brain development and a reduced ability to cope with stress .
" Stress interferes with the ability to learn — it shuts down the brain , " said William Stixrud , Ph.D. , a Silver Spring , Maryland , clinical neuropsychologist and co-author of the study .
The study was conducted in a private K - 12 school for children with language - based learning disabilities .
Participation was restricted to 10 students , ages 11 - 14 , who had pre-existing diagnoses of ADHD .
About half of the students were on medication .
The students meditated at school in a group for 10 minutes , morning and afternoon .
To determine the influence of the TM technique , at the beginning and end of the three - month period , parents , teachers and students completed standard ADHD assessment inventories measuring stress and anxiety , behavior and social competency , and executive function .
Students were also given a battery of performance tests to measure cognitive functioning .
Andy and Daryl Schoenbach 's daughter was diagnosed with ADHD in second grade .
Like most ADHD children she was taking medication .
" The medication helped but had mixed results — she still lost focus , had meltdowns , and the medications affected her sleep and appetite , " said Andy , who lives with Daryl in Washington D.C.
" She was not performing close to her potential and we did n't see the situation improving .
So at the end of seventh grade when her doctor recommended increasing the medication , we decided it was time to take a different course — stopping the medication and using Transcendental Meditation .
"
" The results were quite remarkable , " Daryl said .
" The twice daily meditations smoothed things out , gave her perspective , and enabled her to be in greater control of her own life when things started falling apart .
It took some time , but it gradually changed the way she handled crises and enabled her to feel confident that she could take on greater challenges — in her own words , ' climb a mountain . ' " " Everyone noticed the change , " Andy added .
Grosswald explained that there is substantial research showing the effectiveness of the TM technique for reducing stress and anxiety , and improving cognitive functioning among the general population .
" What 's significant about these new findings is that among children who have difficulty with focus and attention , we see the same results .
TM does n't require concentration , controlling the mind or disciplined focus .
The fact that these children are able to do TM , and do it easily shows us that this technique may be particularly well suited for children with ADHD , " she said .
A second , recently completed TM - ADHD study with a control group measured brain function using electroencephalography ( EEG ) .
Preliminary data shows that three months practice of the technique resulted in significant positive changes in brain functioning during visual - motor skills .
Changes were specifically seen in the circuitry of the brain associated with attention and distractibility .
After six months TM practice , measurements of distractibility moved into the normal range .
A third TM - ADHD study , to be funded by a $ 2 million grant from the David Lynch Foundation ( DavidLynchFoundation.org ) , will more fully investigate the effects of the technique on ADHD and other learning disorders .
This study was funded by the Abramson Family Foundation and the Institute for Community Enrichment .
FACT SHEET
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD )
The Center for Disease Control reports that nearly 50 percent of the 4.5 million children ( ages 4 - 17 ) in the United States diagnosed with ADHD are on ADHD medication — and the majority of those on medication stay on it in adulthood .
The rate of prescriptions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in the U.S. has increasing by a factor of five since 1991 — with production of ADHD medicines up 2,000 percent in 9 years .
The commonly used drugs for ADHD are stimulants ( amphetamines ) .
These drugs can cause persistent and negative side effects , including sleep disturbances , reduced appetite , weight loss , suppressed growth , and mood disorders .
The side effects are frequently treated with additional medications to manage insomnia or mood swings .
Almost none of the medications prescribed for insomnia or mood disturbances are approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for use with children .
The long - term health effects of ADHD medications are not fully known , but evidence suggests risks of cardiac disorders and sudden death , liver damage and psychiatric events .
It has also been found that children on long - term medication have significantly higher rates of delinquency , substance use , and stunted physical growth .
The Transcendental Meditation Technique
Fit for a baa - by :
The newborn lamb who needs an extra woolly layer to cope with the cold
This tiny , orphaned lamb cuts quite a sight in his woolly jumper , which is helping him to cope with sub - zero temperatures this winter .
Affectionately known as Jack Frost , the little lamb , born remarkably early on January 1 , thinks nothing of wearing an extra woolly layer .
The tiny knitted garment , meant for a human baby , fits perfectly and Jack likes nothing more than snuggling up in it during the freezing weather .
Cold air baa-ned : Jack
Frost the tiny lamb copes with the sub - zero temperatures thanks to his new woolly jumper
Abandoned at birth , little Jack , who is one of twins , was rescued by volunteers at Manor Farm Country Park , near Southampton , Hampshire .
Farm manager Andrew Davies said : ' We think his mother just could n't cope with the two lambs .
' This could be something to do with the fact that they were born out of season or just that she did n't have that important maternal instinct , which does happen sometimes . '
Concerned about the risk of the tiny new born perishing in the cold weather , volunteers at the farm did all they could to keep Jack warm .
Mr Davies said : ' We brought in some hay bales and a heat lamp for him - then one volunteer had the novel idea of giving him a jumper .
' She trawled all the local charity shops and was lucky enough to find a knitted wool jumper among the baby clothes .
' It fits Jack perfectly - it 's like it was made just for him . '
Happy to be wrapped up against the cold , the only time Jack is n't wearing the fetching pully is when it 's being washed .
Mr Davies said : ' During washing day Jack 's jumper goes up on the washing line with all the other laundry - it 's quite a funny sight to see . '
The friendly lamb has quickly become a favourite with farm volunteers , and visitors are flocking in to see the woolly spectacle .
All - wrapped up :
The tiny knitted garment , meant for a human baby , fits perfectly and Jack likes nothing more than snuggling up in it during the freezing weather
Mr Davies said : ' Everyone thinks Jack is so cute and they think his jumper is so funny - they all see the irony of a sheep wearing a woolly jumper .
' He 's very human - friendly .
He loves the attention just as much as he loves his jumper - he snuggles up in it just like any baby would snuggle up to something warm . '
The little lamb has adapted well to life on the new farm , seeing many of his carers as his surrogate mothers .
And , according to Mr Davies , the farm volunteers are happy to play the maternal role for little Jack .
He said : ' We all see Jack as another member of our family .
' He 's not hard work to look after at all .
Everyone loves taking care of him because he 's got such a lovely character . '
Mr Davies is delighted that Jack had adapted so well to life at the farm but is concerned that if he continued to grow so quickly he will soon be too big for his new jumper .
He said : ' It 's great that Jack is putting on weight but he 's putting it on so fast it wont be long before the jumper is too small and we 'll have to find something else for him . '
Jack will be at the park for a few months until he is big enough to be returned to his mother 's herd at a farm in East Tisted , near Alton .

Mr Turk 's speech was cut on live TV
A prominent Kurdish politician has defied Turkish law by giving a speech to parliament in his native Kurdish .
Ahmet Turk was addressing his party in parliament when he suddenly switched language from Turkish to Kurdish .
The live broadcast on state TV was immediately cut , as the language is banned in parliament .
Some one - fifth of Turkey 's population are ethnic Kurds , but speaking Kurdish in public was banned until the 1990s , as it was seen as a threat to unity .
The Kurdish language is , however , still banned in all state institutions and official correspondence .
Fight for votes
When Mr Turk defied the law , party members gave him a standing ovation .
There was praise from Kurds here in the south east too - where people described the speech as a brave move , long overdue .
They also called for all restrictions on the use of Kurdish to be lifted .
Ahmet Turk 's party - the DTP - is already facing closure , accused of fuelling separatism , and his speech in Kurdish could well strengthen the case against it .
All this reflects the mounting fight for Kurdish votes in next month 's important local elections .
The governing AK party has set its sights on winning in this region - and points to a new state TV channel in Kurdish as proof of its good intentions .
But many Kurds insist there is little real change here yet .
While Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently spoke Kurdish on the campaign trail to attract their votes , when ethnic Kurdish politicians use their mother tongue they are still prosecuted on a regular basis .
AN ANTI - RACISM campaign allowing the Federal Government to respond more quickly to ugly flare - ups such as the Cronulla riots and racial abuse of Sudanese migrants in Melbourne will be announced today .
The Diverse Australia Program will provide grants up to $ 150,000 for projects in areas where racial intolerance is found .
It will replace grants handed out by the Howard government to promote " living in harmony " after a review found there needed to be a stronger focus on racial intolerance .
But Harmony Day , an annual event held on March 21 , will be retained after the review found it had high levels of support .
The parliamentary secretary for multicultural affairs , Laurie Ferguson , told The Age the anti-racism campaign would target outer suburbs with high migration levels , such as Noble Park in Melbourne and Rosemeadow in Sydney , the scene of a recent violent brawl .
About the new features in LyX 1.6
What 's new in LyX 1.6 ?
The LyX Team
November 2008
The development of LyX 1.6.0 took off in July 2007 .
In November 2008 , LyX 1.6.0 was finally released .
Here 's an overview of the major new features that were implemented .
Categories : Development , LyX_1_6
Abdelrazak Younes enhanced the way work areas are implemented .
In LyX 1.5 a window was composed of a tab bar and a single work area ; the tab bar was basically just a handy way for switching documents in the one work area .
Now , there are as many work areas as tab items .
This means two things to the user :
An open document can be hidden without a tab element being affected .
This is especially useful for documents that have multiple child documents that you do n't really want to edit .
This also means that a given buffer can be hidden without being closed .
Two windows do not have the same set of tab elements : users can arrange which documents to edit in each window .
The support for multiple work areas paved the way to so - called " split - view " support .
Abdelrazak Younes finally implemented that long - awaited feature .
Split views works the same way as multiple windows except that ( of course ) they share the same window , including the menubar and the toolbars .
Martin Vermeer enhanced the way collapsible insets can be configured .
Formatting information can be specified in layout files
Besides character styles , custom ( user defined ) insets can be defined in layout files now .
Richard
Heck has given birth to the " layout modules " feature .
To add anything to the layout in LyX ( for example , a custom character style ) , you previously had to edit the layout files themselves .
This feature allows the use of layout " modules " which can be chosen within Document →Settings .
So , for example , you could put all your custom character styles into mycharstyles .
module , and then use this module with any document class .
LyX 1.6 will ship with several modules , too , including one that defines an custom endnote inset ( see above . )
The third - party modules started to grow here .
Richard
Heck rewrote the internal representation of BibTeX data and , as a result , was able to add new search functionality to the citation dialog .
You can now search by field ( author , title , etc ) and by entry type ( article , book , etc ) .
Richard has also added a cache for BibTeX data , which will speed up use of the citation dialog significantly for users on slower machines and for those who use large BibTeX databases .
Layout Categories .
Layouts in LyX 1.6 are grouped into categories .
The layout list will display small category headers to make it easier to find the right layout .
Layout List Filtering .
The number of possible layouts can be huge .
The layout list sometimes fills up the screen space and makes scrolling necessary .
Stefan Schimanski added a keyboard filter mechanism : just type some characters of the layout you are after .
The list will shrink to the matches of your search .
Together with the shortcut " M - p Space " to open the layout list , you are always only a few keys away from any layout .
Sorting .
Up to now only thematical sorting of available layouts was possible .
Alphabetical sorting for better orientation in longer layout lists is also possible in 1.6 .
Pavel Sanda has implemented support for the LaTeX - package hyperref .
With hyperref you can link all cross-references , URLs , etc. in the PDF and DVI output .
You can furthermore automatically create PDF - bookmarks , set the appearance of links , set the start properties of PDF ( fullscreen , zoom , etc. ) and set header information so that indexing services are able to gather summary from your PDF document .
The hyperref options dialog is shown below :
Uwe Stöhr has rewritten the handling of URLs and created a dialog to produce hyperlinks .
URLs
The menu Insert →URL has been moved to Insert →Custom insets →URL .
This creates a collapsible inset with only one field .
The former inset with an additional field for the URL name is now used for hyperlinks ( see next paragraph ) .
URL insets of existing LyX documents will be transformed into the new custom inset URLs .
Hyperlinks
LyX 1.6.0 introduces a new inset to create hyperlinks .
Link target , name , and type can be specified .
If no link name is given , the target will be displayed in the output .
Uwe Stöhr has revised LyX's support for wrapped floats .
The wrap float dialog now allows to optionally set an overhang for floats , that is , the float can be shifted horizontally with regard to the page margin .
This new wrap float is furthermore now really able to float .
Furthermore , you can specify the number of text lines that are required by the float ( see the screenshot below ) .
Finally , LyX now also has a wrap table float .
Thanks to Jürgen Spitzmüller , now all kind of floats , not only figure and table , can be rotated sideways .
Furthermore , rotated figure and table floats can now span multiple columns .
LyX had support for subfigures , but it was both clumsy and outdated : Subfigure captions had to be entered in the graphics dialog , which disallowed both short titles and proper LyX cross-referencing and emphasizing ; furthermore , subfigure support was based on the outdated package subfigure , which was superseded by the more powerful subfig a long time ago .
LyX 1.6 not only switches to the newer package , but it also introduces a completely overhauled support for nested figures , including new support for nested floats of all kinds ( tables , algorithms , etc. ) .
The UI implemented by Jürgen is both easy and powerful : simply insert a figure / table / algorithm float into a figure / table / algorithm float to get a subfloat with a subcaption .
All the stuff that works for ordinary floats ( labels , short titles ) work here as well .
Stefan Schimanski contributed a new implementation of math macros , the LyX counterpart of
ewcommand macros in TeX .
You can define mathematical notations once and at one place in the document and use them all over your formulas .
Although this was available in older LyX version to some extent , LyX 1.6 takes them seriously for the first time :
You can define math macros with up to 9 parameters .
Optional parameters with default values are supported , even more than one optional parameter .
Macros are position aware , i.e. LyX will know where they were defined in the document and which macro version is to be displayed at any point .
Redefine macros as you like throughout the buffer .
Remove and add parameters as you like .
LyX will adapt all instances of the macro in the text .
LyX knows about macros in child and master documents .
Create your macro collection in a macro file and use this in all your documents .
You can edit macros inline using holes to be filled with the parameters .
Or use your beloved , old - style parameter list edit mode .
Render just a child document and LyX will make sure all macros are defined correctly , even though their real definition is e.g. in the master document .
For further details you can look here .
If you like YouTube look here .
Test cases can be found here .
Stefan Schimanski implemented the well - known completion in the math editor and in text mode .
In an equation just enter \ and see available math commands including symbols and your own math macros , which are valid at that point .
To match everybody 's taste you can configure the grey inline completion and the completion popup for math and text via an extensive preferences pane .
You can see a small screencast of completion in action here at YouTube .
Keybindings : Tab will " accept " the suggested completion .
( Due to work by Richard Heck , implementing a suggestion by Günther Milde , this does not interfere with the use of Tab to navigate tables . )
There is no default keybinding to ask LyX to suggest a completion , but individual users can bind any key they wish to " complete " .
In order to further improve the user experience with regard to inset understanding , Abdelrazak Younes put in place a framework for tooltip showing in the document work area .
Some tooltips show some practical advices , other indicate their content ( as shown below for footnotes ) .
Users are invited to send recommendation and / or ideas for further enhancements of this features to the devel list .
A framework for context menu was put in place by Abdelrazak Younes .
Right - clicking somewhere in a text or math area will popup an edit context menu .
Most insets have specific context menus .
Below is the current context menu of the citation inset as an example :
Jürgen Spitzmüller has implemented a symbols dialog .
It provides access to all supported symbols of the given encoding .
Did you know LyX supported horizontal spaces like \qquad and \enskip as of 1.4.0 ?
No ?
Probably , because they could be accessed only via esoteric LyX functions .
Now LyX comes with a horizontal space dialog that lets you choose from a range of predefined horizontal spaces , similar to the established vertical space dialog .
This dialog also contains the horizontal fill which was implemented as an inset of its own previously , and , as new features , custom horizontal space ( LaTeX : \hspace and \hspace * ) as well as horizontal fills with patterns ( LaTeX : \ dotfill , \hrulefill , \rightarrowfill , \leftarrowfill , \upbracefill and \ downbracefill ) .
Edwin Leuven and Abdelrazak Younes revised the paragraph settings dialog for better usability .
In particular it is now possible to have the paragraph settings synchronized with the currently edited paragraph .
See the screenshot below :
Previously , it was offered to display graphics within LyX in monochrome or grayscale .
Because those graphics transformations are performance and memory consuming and do not bring any graphical performance improvement , we decided to remove the options .
This results in a simplified interface , especially for the external - material dialog , as the user does n't have to wonder anymore if he should choose ' Color ' or ' Preview ' .
Following this change , advanced users will need to adapt their external templates if any ( see the release notes ) .
This work was done by Abdelrazak Younes .
Thanks to Bo Peng LyX has now a nice user interface for the key bindings .
A shortcut configuration panel was added to the preferences dialog .
It displays all shortcuts defined in the current bind file , and allows users to add and remove shortcuts .
A help document " Shortcuts " was added to the Help menu .
It displays all current shortcuts in a nice table format .
This document is dynamic in the sense that its printout can vary from system to system , depending on system configuration .
The magic behind this is a newly introduced inset called InsetInfo .
Stefan Schimanski added support for pasting graphics directly from the clipboard .
Getting graphics into LyX usually takes a number of steps : draw it , export it , find it in the file dialog and insert it .
Now you can also easily copy graphics from any application and paste it via the clipboard as PNG or JPEG .
On Windows you can paste as metafile ( EMF / WMF ) data from nearly any application which gives you high quality vector graphics .
On Mac OSX you can paste as PDF data from nearly any application which gives you high quality vector graphics .
On Mac OSX you can paste via the LinkBack technology from any LinkBack - enabled application .
This also gives you high quality PDF vector graphics , but in addition to that , also the ability to edit the figure later in the original editing application .
Uwe Stöhr revised the language support .
LyX supports now also
Albanian
Bahasa Malaysia / Bahasa Melayu
Interlingua
Latin
Latvian
Lithuanian
Lower Sorbian
Mexican Spanish
Mongolian
North Sami
Polytonic Greek
Serbian ( Cyrillic and Latin letters )
Vietnamese
With the help of Koji Yokota , Tetsuya Makimura , and Jürgen Spitzmüller , the support for Japanese has been improved .
Furthermore , users of the CJK package for Chinese , Japanese , and Korean script can now also customize the font in the Document dialog .
Dov Feldstern added " visual mode " cursor movement in bidirectional text .
This mode can be enabled in the " Language " pane of the preferences dialog , provided that RTL support is also enabled ( logical mode is still the default ) .
this feature probably still requires some tweaking / bug - fixing .
Please report any issues to the LyX developers mailing list !
Thanks to Uwe Stöhr , LyX now supports the LaTeX - commands \pagebreak and \linebreak .
They act as " soft " break , stretching the rest of the page or line to the whole remaining page height and line width , respectively – in contrast to the already supported commands
ewpage and
ewline that function as " hard breaks " .
While the shortcut C - Return still produces a " hard " line break (
ewline ) , the shortcut C - S - Return produces a soft line break ( \linebreak ) .
and .
They act as " soft " break , stretching the rest of the page or line to the whole remaining page height and line width , respectively – in contrast to the already supported commands and that function as " hard breaks " .
While the shortcut still produces a " hard " line break (
ewline ) , the shortcut produces a soft line break ( \linebreak ) .
Jürgen Spitzmüller added two new special characters :
- " Breakable Slash " inserts a slash after which a linebreak can occur ( LaTeX : \ slash ) .
- " Protected Hyphen " , a hyphen after which no linebreak must occur ( amsmath's
obreakdash ) .
- " Breakable Slash " inserts a slash after which a linebreak can occur ( LaTeX : ) . - " Protected Hyphen " , a hyphen after which no linebreak must occur ( amsmath's ) .
Bernhard Reiter implemented support for both ,
ocite { < key>} ( in the citation dialog ) for adding specific entries to the bibliography without citing , and
ocite {*} ( in the bibtex inset dialog ) for citing all entries of specific bibtex databases .
Pavel Sanda added toggling visibility for certain GUI elements and full - screen mode editing became possible .
Look here for details .
Ever since version 1.4.0 the scrolling behavior of LyX has had a lot of bugs and deficiencies .
Abdelrazak Younes rewrote the scrolling code and fixed most of these .
As a bonus you can now scroll with the keyboard using Ctrl - Alt - [ up / right / PageUp / PageDown ] shortcuts .
Also , when right - clicking on the scrollbar a scrolling context menu pops up .
Abdelrazak Younes extended the outline panel which transformed into a " Navigator " .
The new navigator supports the following navigation lists :
Child Documents
Embedded Files
Labels and References : easy spotting of broken cross-references ( because of an erased label ) , easy spotting of duplicated labels ( since version 1.6 LyX tries to avoid that ) , easy spotting of unused / unreferenced labels , integration of math labels and reference , now works reliably across child documents .
Lists of floats ( Algorithms / Figure / Table )
List of Citations
List of Changes ( If change tracking is enabled )
List of Equations
List of Foot notes
List of Graphics
List of Indexes
List of Listings
List of Marginal notes
List of Notes
Table of Contents :
This list is specific as it contains the outlining feature .
In 1.6 , the promote and demote features will move all child sections .
Note that the navigator has a ' Sort ' checkbox that allows to enable the sorting of each list separately .
Abdelrazak Younes improved the session management that was introduced in the LyX - 1.5 series significantly .
Notable new features are :
each LyX main Window has its own session management .
This means that if you arrange the geometry of two windows , for example , both windows will be restored with their previous geometry at next startup .
each child dialog remembers its last position and size when its referring LyX window is closed .
In addition , some dialogs will also remember their last state with regard to check boxes , etc ( see for example the paragraph dialog ) .
Users are invited to make suggestion as to what should be saved additionally in the session information .
You can now define a default master file for your child documents in the Document dialog .
The advantage of this is that LyX automatically takes informations such as bibliography keys , math macros and labels from the master , even if it is not opened .
Gone are the days were you needed to put a bibtex inset in a comment to get citation working in the child documents .
Furthermore , you can compile a master document from within child document via the master - buffer - view function without having to open this master file .
This feature was contributed by Jürgen Spitzmüller .
Pavel Sanda sanitized the current VCS handling and added support for svn , so basic operations like update / commit / lock / log / new files adding work .
Please refer to the Extended manual for further information .
Martin Vermeer changed the look and feel of index entries .
They are now collapsible insets , so you can format them like any other kind of text in LyX .
Please note that , regrettably , the new index insets cannot always be reverted to earlier LyX versions without loss .
Imagine you have a lot of similar pictures in your document and want to change their size settings in the same way .
Up to now you had to change them one by one or edit .lyx file directly in some plain editor .
This kind of annoying task should be much simpler now .
Pavel Sanda implemented a grouping mechanism for this purpose .
You can now define a new group for any picture in the graphics dialog and any other picture can be joined to this group via its context menu .
Changing settings of any picture from some particular group automatically changes all other pictures within this group .
It is now possible to bind several different LyX functions to a single key .
LyX will then use the key to execute the first of these that is " enabled " in the present context .
In the bind files , the key binding should be given in the following form :
\bind " Tab " " command-alternatives completion-accept;cell-forward;tab-insert;depth-increment;outline-in "
Following the " command - alternatives " keyword , one lists the alternative bindings in order , with the semi-colon delimiter .
Edwin Leuven implemented free line setting in tables .
Where in LyX 1.5 lines were applied to complete rows and columns unless cells were multicolumn cells , now lines are applied to the selected range of cells only .
To facilitate line setting in complete rows / columns it is now also possible to selects complete rows / columns by a single click .
For rows simply click at the beginning of the row and it will be selected .
Dragging the mouse will select a range of rows .
For columns selecting works similarly but now by clicking at the top of the column ( and possibly dragging to select a range of columns ) .
Jürgen Spitzmüller has implemented a Linguistics module that provides numbered examples and glosses ( uses the LaTeX - package " covington " ) as well as some semantic markup useful for linguistic papers .
module that provides numbered examples and glosses ( uses the LaTeX - package " covington " ) as well as some semantic markup useful for linguistic papers .
Uwe Stöhr added support for 6 dot Braille via the layout module Braille ( uses the LaTeX - package " braille " ) .
( uses the LaTeX - package " braille " ) .
Jürgen Spitzmüller added support for the packages pdfpages via the external inset .
Thanks to Vincent van Ravesteijn it is is now possible to use tabulators in program listings .
So you can directly copy C/ C++ code to listings .
Stefan Schimanski added a preference setting to choose between opening new buffers in a tab or in a new window .
The latter is set by default on Mac , the former on all other platforms .
Moreover on Mac you can now close all LyX windows and LyX will stay running , just the way a typical Mac application behaves .
Uwe Stöhr added support for page margin and size settings when importing LaTeX files to LyX .
Pavel Sanda completed the documentation of all LyX functions ( aka LFUNs ) .
One result is here , more info here .
Now it is also possible to access the docs through the help menu .
Jean - Marc Lasgouttes refactorised the code for undo operations .
Actions which resulted in several subactions ( and therefore several undo steps ) ,
are now undone in one step .
Using this infrastructure , document - wide operations like " replace all " now use less memory in big documents .
are now undone in one step .

Is there anything this guy has n't been involved in ?
What 's next for Joe , " Dancing with the Stars ? "
I was watching H&C last night and made this clip after I almost could n't stop laughing at this guy .
Joe " the Plumber " Wurtzelbacher is the perfect definition of what a wingnut is if you never understood the term before .
You see , he survived in our country using welfare , a program designed to help the needy , but now says Obama is not loyal to our country because he wants to take our money and give it to other people .
Does he drive a Cadillac too ?
I guess if it was n't for welfare he would n't be littering our air waves .
His 15 minutes are almost up .
Colmes :
Do you really doubt that Barack Obama 's loyalty to the United States ?
Plumber : Ah ... to a Democracy " yes , " I mean , right back to the , as far as the Socialism issues , spreading the wealth around .
I mean , Alan that is right out of Karl Marx ..... Webster dictionary ... government health care ...
Colmes :
You do n't think he 's loyal to our country ?
Plumber Joe : To democracy ?
He 's proposing a lot of changes that could change the core of America , do n't you think ?
Plumber Joe :
Was it patriotic for Joe Biden to say " take my money and give it to other people ?
That 's patriotism ?
Colmes :
Well , let me ask , you were on welfare once , was that taking somebodies else 's money and giving it to you ?
Plumber Joe : Paid into welfare .
It something to be used , not to be abused like it often is .
Spoken like a true wingnut .
He 's perfect for FOX News .
Colmes nailed him pretty good .
He talks about his principles at the end of the clip , but really they are no principles at all , just the principle of a wingnut .

Professor : US has ' history of violence ' against inspirational leaders Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday November 22 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Americans reflected Saturday on the presidency of John F. Kennedy , who was assassinated 45 years ago , as once again a young , inspiring president is headed to the White House .
President - elect Barack Obama has often been compared for his lofty ideals and charisma to the late JFK , who was shot dead in Dallas , Texas in 1963 .
But Obama 's appeal and his historic election as the first African - American US president have many people worried about potential threats to his life .
" He is inspirational , he is an historic figure , he is the first African - American president ; but there is also -- because of that potential for stirring up social unrest -- that also makes him a target , " said Scott Stuart , senior terror and security analyst for Statfor , a publisher of geopolitical intelligence .
The threats to Obama are nothing new in American politics .
Four American presidents were assassinated : Abraham Lincoln in 1865 , James Garfield in 1880 , William McKinley in 1900 , and JFK .
President Kennedy 's brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King were both gunned down in 1968 .
There have also been assassination attempts against Andrew Jackson , Theodore Roosevelt , Franklin Roosevelt , Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan .
" It 's not only JFK .
It 's Robert Kennedy , it 's Martin Luther King .
We have had a history of violence against inspirational leaders in the US , " explained James Thurber , professor of government at American University .
Thurber said he recalls the era when the Kennedys and King were assassinated , and pointed out similarities between then and now .
" I do remember the time and it is very similar except that Obama is even more inspirational that Kennedy in terms of turning people on and bringing people in from the Republican Party to vote for a Democrat , " he added .
" It 's more historic in some way in the sense that Obama is African - American . "
Obama received the earliest ever Secret Service protection for a presidential candidate in May 2007 -- 18 months before the election -- due to threats and to the large crowds he attracted at campaign stops .
His former rival Hillary Clinton had Secret Service protection due to her status as a former first lady .
Clinton sparked massive criticism in May of this year when invoking the June 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy to defend her decision to remain in the presidential race through June .
She promptly expressed regret for her comments , interpreted as a suggestion that she believed Obama 's life was in danger .
Once Obama " began emerging as a major candidate , he was actually afforded the same level of protection as the president because of the threat and that was really unprecedented , " added Stuart .
" They were so concerned about the threat that he had much higher security than the other candidates . "
Two plots have already been thwarted : in Colorado during the Democratic convention and recently in Tennessee , where two white supremacists were arrested in what authorities said was a plot to conduct a string of armed robberies and murder 88 black people for a spree culminating in a suicide attack on Obama .
According to Stuart , the Secret Service worries most about discrete and not overt threats , those most difficult to identify .
Obama 's high approval ratings , set around 70 percent before he takes up office at the White House , are also a source of concern for experts .
" He just captured the heart and minds of the American people , " said Allan Lichtman , history professor at American University , commenting on the public 's high expectations .
" But we are all aware of the danger that comes with that , particularly for the first time an African - American is president . "
More than 2000 people marched through central Brisbane today to protest Israel 's incursion into Gaza .
At a rally in the city one of the organisers , who wished to be known only as Abdullah , said the large turnout showed the growing momentum of Australia 's opposition movement to Israel 's actions .

Anger over the policing of last Saturday 's Palestinian solidarity demonstration in London continued today , with activists saying the police were " asking for another Hillsborough disaster " .
The weekend march - part of a coordinated international protest - drew large crowds , although police and organisers disagreed on the exact number .
Problems occurred when a section of the protest split from the main group to demonstrate outside the Israeli embassy in Kensington .
Accounts differ , but somehow thousands of demonstrators found themselves in an underground tunnel by Hyde Park Corner being baton - charged by police .
" It was like the scene from [ a ] battle , " Respect MP George Galloway told politics.co.uk .
" There were scores of people on the ground , mainly women and children .
They were screaming and crying .
On the second charge I myself was knocked over .
" I was surrounded by women and children begging me to ask police to stop , " he continued .
" I took my gloves off and walked forward with my hands up .
I made for the oldest policeman , assuming he was more senior .
But before I could say a single word he slammed my in the chest with his shield and held up his baton as if to hit me with it . "
There is a strong disagreement between police and activists about who made the first move .
The official statement from the Metropolitan police said : " As police were attempting to facilitate people through in a controlled manner a small number of people attempted to push through police lines , threw missiles at officers and attempted to drag officers into the crowd of demonstrators . "
It continued : " A number of stewards and other protestors attempted to calm the situation .
Officers made one 10 m advance into the crowd to regain control of the protest , using recognised and proportionate tactics . "
Mr Galloway admitted there was some provocation from demonstrators but questioned the proportionality of the police response .
" There were youths wearing masks and they were throwing placards , which are bad if they get you in the eye but not exactly molotov cocktails , and police of course were wearing armour and so on . "
John Rees , co-founder of the Stop the War Coalition and a steward on the march agreed .
" I was in the tunnel as well , " he told politics .co.uk .
" It was one of the most dangerous pieces of policing I 've ever seen .
The police decision to charge the demonstrators three times wielding batons was bad enough , but to do it in a tunnel where thousands of people had to run backwards towards another crowd of people was asking for another Hillsborough disaster to take place .
" We were lucky there were so few injuries . "
The coalition met with police yesterday to go over routes for next Saturday 's march , which will meet at Speaker 's Corner and proceed to the Israeli embassy .
Organisers used the opportunity to raise concerns about last Saturday 's protest .
When politics .co.uk asked Mr Rees what he expected to get out of the complaint , he replied : " Frankly not a lot , but if you do n't raise it you do n't get anywhere .
" The aim is to convince police they should n't be deploying riot police against anti-war demonstrations and that whatever police are deployed they do n't behave like they did on Saturday . "
Israeli 's military action in Gaza Strip is entering its 11th day today , with Israeli troops deep in the region and no obvious end in sight .

Will Palin Meet the Press ?
Not Really .
Created : September 02 , 2008 08:57 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
PHILADELPHIA — Now that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is in the national spotlight , speculation about how she will hold up to the intense media scrutiny is rampant .
On an otherwise lazy holiday weekend , a slew of revelations about Sen .
John McCain ’s running mate surfaced , suggesting the McCain campaign ’s self - styled intensive vetting process may not have been so stringent after all .
Politico ’s Michael Calderone examines Palin ’s relationship with the Alaskan media for indications of how she will perform on the national stage :
Bob Tkacz , a freelance reporter who ’s covered the legislature and seafood industry since 1990 , described Palin as willing to answer a couple questions while dropping her daughter , Piper , off at the bus stop , a stone ’s throw from both the governor ’s mansion and Capitol building .
“ She ’s very accessible , ” said Tkacz .
“ I ’m not sure that ’s the same as open . ”
Tkacz described her style in news conference to that of a PTA meeting , adding that Palin keeps to the script at most times .
Another reporter described her as often having staffers nearby during such conferences to field questions , too …
Dermot Cole , a columnist and editorial board member of the Fairbanks Daily News - Miner , said that Palin has met with the paper ’s editors several times , but has generally avoided meetings that involve deep discussion of policy and issues .
“ She is the most reluctant of all the governors we ’ve had to participate , ” said Cole , who ’s spent three decades at the paper .
Therefore , Cole added , “ I think it ’s unproven how she ’s going to handle this intense scrutiny . ”
Calderone also quotes Judith Erickson , wife of the editor - at - large of the Alaska Oil and Legislative Report , who indicates Palin is likely to deflect questions for which she is unprepared :
Of course , it may be more than a little naive to assume that Palin will spend much time talking to the press .
We ’ve written extensively about the lack of access the McCain campaign has given the national media recently — McCain has not held a press conference in nearly three weeks .
In that time , the only questions he has answered have been in one - on - one interviews , mostly with local media .
I ’ve been on the road with McCain the entire time since he announced Palin as his running mate , and I have yet to be within a couple hundred feet of her .
The only time I ’ve seen her face has been on television or on the Jumbo - trons at the rally in Dayton , Ohio , where McCain made the announcement .
Palin also has yet to take a question from any reporter since her selection , local or national .
Perhaps with good reason .
The McCain campaign is clearly uncomfortable allowing even the presumed GOP nominee — a seasoned politician who built his career and his reputation on “ straight talk ” with the press — to face the media .
They ’re probably not too keen on putting Palin out there , without a net , in front of reporters eager to test her qualifications for the nation ’s second - highest office .
One fumbled answer to a hardball question on , say , foreign policy — which , by the way , any other vice presidential candidate would be expected to answer — could prove devastating when played over and over on cable news channels , let alone a series of them .
I expect Palin ’s role in the campaign will be to appear at rallies , mostly in battleground states , and to interact with the press as little as possible — just like her running mate .
I just had to sort a list of DIVs by date with the newest date first .
To add complexity to the problem the dates could be either in Atom or RSS2 format .
The sorting itself is done with TinySort .
A really useful little library .
The HTML looks like this :
< div class= " article_cont " > < span class =" hide_me_date " >
Atom or RSS2 date here </ span > ... </div > < div class= " article_cont " > < span class =" hide_me_date " >
Atom or RSS2 date here </ span > ... </div > ...
And the Javascript with irrelevant parts cut out :
function parseDate(d ) { var res = d.match(/\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d/) ; if ( res ) { Date. format = " yyyy - mm- dd " ; var dt = new Date ( res [ 0 ] ) ; }else var dt = new Date (d ) ; return dt.getTime ( ) ; } ... $ ( ".hide_me_date " ) .each ( function ( i ) { $ ( this ) .html ( parseDate ( $ ( this ) .html ( ) ) ) ; } ) ; $ ( ".article_cont " ) .tsort ( " .hide_me_date " , {order : " desc " } ) ; ...
In case we have an Atom date we get the juicy part through the match in parseDate .
If we got a match we create a date with it , if we do n’t have a match we have RSS2 instead in which case we can just use the date as is .
At the end we return the number of microseconds since 1977 or something like that , it does n’t matter as long as we got something we can sort by .
When we loop through all SPANs with the hide_me_date class , the parseDate function is used to switch the original Atom or RSS2 dates into a microsecond integer which we finally use in conjunction with tsort .
Note the dependency on date.js .

John Holdren , director of Harvard ’s Science , Technology and Public Policy Program as well as of the Woods Hole Research Center , is said to be the nominee for the next US presidential science adviser ( Image : Woods Hole Research Center )
Read a blog about whether there are too many physicists on Obama ’s team
Barack Obama ’s growing all - star science team is poised to pick up another heavy hitter .
As first reported in the blog ScienceInsider , the president - elect will nominate John P Holdren of Harvard University to be his science adviser and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy .
On paper , Holdren is not exactly a radical departure from previous holders of the office .
A physicist with expertise in nuclear arms control , he was a member of President Bill Clinton ’s science and technology advisory committee and a past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .

But as a major player in global environmental and energy policy – he is director of Harvard ’s Science , Technology and Public Policy Program as well as of the Woods Hole Research Center , Holdren brings a different set of priorities and a more outspoken personality to a position that has been widely regarded as in decline during the Bush administration .
“ He could add a new dimension to the role , ” says David Guston , co-director of the Consortium for Science , Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University in Tempe .
Many cooks in the kitchen
When combined with the recent nomination of Nobel laureate Steven Chu as energy secretary and former EPA head Carol Browner in the newly created role of assistant to the president for energy and climate change , the choice of Holdren as science adviser leaves no doubt that Obama intends to make climate change a high priority when he takes office next month .
In fact , with so many high - profile nominees in his inner circle with expertise in energy and environmental policy , it remains to be seen which voice will have the biggest influence on the new president .
“ There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen now , ” says Roger Pielke Jr , of the University of Colorado ’s Center for Science and Technology Policy Research .
“ It makes me curious to see how the Obama administration is going to manage all of these high - profile personalities . ”
Institutionally , Holdren will have his work cut out for him if he hopes to play the dominant role in shaping key science policy decisions .
This is because , unlike many other cabinet - level positions , the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy can be called on to testify before Congress , which would tend to make a president reluctant to share politically sensitive information with his science adviser .
And unlike many jobs in the president ’s inner circle , the science adviser does not administer a large budget or control any government agencies .
On the other hand , the office has direct input into setting priorities and budget allocations for science and technology activities across the federal government .
There is one indication that under Holdren the position of science adviser will enjoy an elevated standing in the White House .
According to an announcement released from Harvard , Holdren will be named Assistant to the President for Science and Technology .
The “ assistant ” title , which generally indicates a closer relationship to the president , has not always been bestowed on science advisers .

By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
Bangkok , December 15 , 2008 --
The appointment of ``Democrat '' Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva as the new Prime Minister of Thailand is the final stage of the second coup against an elected government .
After the deliberate chaos created by the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) seizure of the airports , the courts stepped in to dissolve the hugely popular governing Thai Rak Thai ( Peoples Power Party ) for the second time .
[ The constitutional court dissolved the party for fraud in the 2007 election that brought it to power . ]
The army chief then called a meeting of Democrat Party parliamentarians , along with some of the most corrupt elements of the governing coalition parties .
It is widely believed that the army chief and others threatened and bribed MPs to change sides .
Chief among them is ``Newin Chitchorp ' ' , who was named by his father after the infamous Burmese dictator .
The Democrat Party is known among the cyber community as the ``Cockroach Party ' ' .
This is because cockroaches live in filthy places and can survive even nuclear holocausts .
The party has survived for many years , forming governments after various crises .
These so - called Democrats have systematically backed anti-democratic measures .
They supported the 2006 coup , the military constitution and the PAD .
One Democrat Party MP was the leader of the mob that took over the international airport .
Over the last 30 years , the Democrat Party has never won an overall majority in parliament .
It does not represent the people .
During the government of former Peoples Power Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra it spent the whole time criticising the government 's universal healthcare scheme and other pro-poor policies .
After the 1997 economic crisis it used state money to prop up the banks and guarantee the savings of the rich , while telling the poor to fend for themselves and depend on their families .
Even Abhisit 's name in Thai means ``privilege ' ' .
He is an Oxford graduate from a wealthy family .
The first coup , on September 19 , 2006 , was a straightforward military coup , using tanks and soldiers wearing royal yellow ribbons .
The military junta tore - up the democratic constitution and replaced it with an authoritarian one .
Half the Senate was appointed by the military and many so - called independent bodies were staffed by junta supporters .
The military appointed themselves to lucrative state enterprise positions .
Then they got the courts to dissolve the Thai Rak Thai Party despite the fact that it had won repeated elections .
Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party was and remains hugely popular among the majority of Thais .
This party introduced the first universal healthcare scheme , and projects to stimulate village economies .
The aim was to develop Thailand as a whole , increasing the education and health status of the general population , thus turning them into ``stakeholders ' ' .
This was a winning formula , an alliance between a pro-poor capitalist party and the poor , both urban and rural .
` Old Order '
But Thaksin 's modernisation plans , which also included major infrastructure development such as public transport projects for Bangkok , upset the ``Old Order ' ' .
This `` Old Order '' is not headed by Thailand 's king , as many commentators think .
The Old Order is made up of local political mafias , the army , conservative judges and the Democrat Party .
They were joined by businessmen like Sonti Limtongkul , who initially supported Thaksin , but fell out over personal interests .
The PAD mobilised a fascist - style middle class mob to cause chaos .
They seized the Government House , destroyed offices , stole weapons and then tried to close parliament .
Their final act was the takeover of the two international airports with the open support of the military .
The PAD and the Old Order want to reduce democracy further .
They want to reduce the number of elected members of parliament , stiffen lèse majesté ( the crime of ``injury ' ' to royalty ) laws and destroy the alliance between the poor and Thaksin .
They are angry that the poor have become politicised .
They hate the fact that state budgets were spent on healthcare , rural development and education .
Instead they want to cling to their old privileges , espouse strict monetarism ( except for elite and military spending ) and advocate that the poor should be ``sufficient '' in their poverty .
These people use neoliberal , free - market ideas in association with the king 's ``sufficiency economy '' ideology .
Their excuse for opposing democracy is their belief that the poor are too stupid to deserve the right to vote .
The Thai king has always been weak [ 1 ] .
His status has been systematically promoted by military juntas and the elite in general .
We are all socialised to think that the king is an ``ancient absolute monarchy '' , while at the same time being within the constitution .
This picture of power creates a shell to protect the entire ruling class and the status quo under a climate of fear .
The army especially needs such a legitimising shell because it is no longer OK for the military hold political power , unless it can claim to protect the monarchy .
In previous political crises , such as in 1973 and 1992 , the king only intervened late in the day after it was clear who had won .
In the present crisis the king has remained silent and has not made any attempts to resolve the crisis .
He missed his annual birthday speech on December 4 , claiming a sore throat .
Struggle between elites
The royal dimension to this crisis is that it is a struggle between two elite groups .
One side have been much more successful in claiming royal legitimacy .
But ironically this claim by the anti-Thaksin lot is causing a crisis for the monarchy because it associates the PAD violence and law - breaking with the monarchy , and the actions by the military have created an image that the monarchy is against the majority of the population .
The support shown by Thailand 's queen for the PAD has also angered or disappointed many Thais .
The new government will be made up of a coalition of some of the most corrupt and unprincipled politicians .
This shows that the elites ' opposition to Thaksin was never really about preventing corruption or vote buying , despite the fact that many ordinary middle - class people might have felt that it was .
Even the Democrat Party has a history of vote buying and corruption .
The Democrat governor of Bangkok had to resign recently under a corruption cloud .
Yet the party was not dissolved by the courts .
So far , Thaksin and his fellow politicians have only been found guilty of technicalities .
No serious corruption charges have been proven .
No evidence of real election fraud has ever been unearthed .
In fact , Thaksin 's party was reducing the importance of vote buying through pro-poor policies .
This is what angered the Old Order .
It meant that they could only overthrow his government by promising more to the poor or by using various means to organise coups .
There are a number of questions which need to be put to the new government :
1 . Will the government punish PAD leaders for breaking the law , including the Democrat MP who took over the airport ?
Will the PAD be made to answer for the damage at Government House ?
Will the Democrats expel its MP who lead the airport occupation ?
2 . Will the military chiefs be sacked for breaking the law and intervening in politics .
Will they be sacked for giving the green light to the takeover of the airports and thus compromising airport security ?
3 . Will the government defend the undemocratic constitution or will it amend the constitution to increase democracy ?
4 . Will elections be held as soon as possible to allow the Thai population to have a say ?
5 . What serious measures will the government take in order to protect the poor from the economic crisis .
What job - creating policies does it have ?
How can it stop workers being sacked from factories .
Will it increase wages and cut the value - added tax in order to stimulate the economy ?
Will the government increase taxation on the rich in order to help the poor ?
6 . Will the government punish state officials who murdered unarmed demonstrators in southern Thailand , at Takbai , during the Thaksin government ?
Will it withdraw troops and police so that a peaceful political solution can be achieved ?
7 . Will the government ensure a balanced media by allowing significant space for [ pro- democracy supporters of the sacked government ] Red Shirt critics ?
Or will the government increase censorship and media bias ?
Will it repeal the lèse majesté law and allow public scrutiny and criticism of the courts ?
Many of us can guess what the answers will be ...

( CNN ) --
An Israeli patrol boat struck a boat carrying medical volunteers and supplies to Gaza early Tuesday as it attempted to intercept the vessel in the Mediterranean Sea , witnesses and Israeli officials said .
The Dignity arrives in Tyre , Lebanon , after it was reportedly rammed by an Israeli military vessel Tuesday .
CNN correspondent Karl Penhaul was aboard the 60 - foot pleasure boat Dignity when the contact occurred .
When the boat later docked in the Lebanese port city of Tyre , severe damage was visible to the forward port side of the boat , and the front left window and part of the roof had collapsed .
It was flying the flag of Gibraltar .
The Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain , Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists from the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory .
Also on board was former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney .
Penhaul said an Israeli patrol boat shined its spotlight on the Dignity , and then it and another patrol boat shadowed the Dignity for about a half hour before the collision .
One patrol boat " very severely rammed " the Dignity , Penhaul said .
The captain of the Dignity told Penhaul he received no warning .
Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities , the captain said .
But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area .
Palmor said there was no response to the radio message , and the vessel then tried to out - maneuver the Israeli patrol boat , leading to the collision .
Watch Penhaul describe the boat damage »
The captain and crew said their vessel was struck intentionally , Penhaul said , but Palmor called those allegations " absurd . "
" There is no intention on the part of the Israeli navy to ram anybody , " Palmor said .
" I would call it ramming .
Let 's just call it as it is , " McKinney said after the boat docked in Lebanon .
" Our boat was rammed three times , twice in the front and one on the side .

" Our mission was a peaceful mission to deliver medical supplies and our mission was thwarted by the Israelis -- the aggressiveness of the Israeli military , " she said .
The incident occurred in international waters about 90 miles off Gaza .
Israel controls the waters off Gaza 's coast and routinely blocks ships from coming into the Palestinian territory as part of an ongoing blockade that also applies to the Israel - Gaza border .
Human rights groups have expressed concern about the blockade on Gaza , which has restricted the delivery of emergency aid and fuel supplies .
Tuesday 's collision was so severe , Penhaul said , that the passengers were ordered to put on their life vests and be ready to get in lifeboats .
The Dignity began taking on water , but the crew managed to pump it out of the hull long enough for the boat to reach shore .
" It could have ended with people drowning if they hit us more square on , " Dignity 's captain , Denis Healey , said .
" It could have gone down in minutes . "
Palmor said the vessel refused assistance after the incident .
The boat was carrying boxes of relief supplies , volunteers and journalists to Gaza , the Palestinian territory that has been subject to an intense Israeli bombing campaign since Saturday .
Israel Tuesday lambasted McKinney -- the Green Party 's 2008 candidate for the U.S. presidency and a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia -- for taking part in the maritime mission .
In a written statement , the Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast , based in Atlanta , Georgia , said McKinney " has taken it upon herself to commit an act of provocation , " endangering herself and the crew .
" We regret that during this time of crisis , while Israel is battling with the terrorist organization of Hamas and defending its citizens , that we are forced to deal with Ms. McKinney 's irresponsible behavior , " the statement read .
The trip was the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement 's sixth in as many months .
Israel launched airstrikes against Gaza on Saturday in what Defense Minister Ehud Barak called an " all - out war " against the Palestinian militant group Hamas , which has ruled the territory since 2007 .
The Israeli military says its goal is to stop a recent barrage of rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel .
Watch the chaos in Gaza and Israel »
The Palestinian death toll has topped 375 , most of them Hamas militants , Palestinian medical sources said Tuesday .
At least 60 civilians have been killed in Gaza , U.N. officials said .
Hamas has continued to fire rockets at southern Israeli towns since the airstrikes began , Israel says .
Six Israelis have been killed -- five of them civilians .
Hamas has vowed to defend Gaza in the face of what it calls continued Israeli aggression .
Each side blames the other for violating an Egyptian - brokered cease - fire , which formally expired December 19 , but had been weakening for months .

Last night , on the evening of President Barack Obama ’s first major speech , the Republicans put forward Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal as the face of the opposition , tapping him to deliver their response .
As a 37 - year - old Indian - American Rhodes Scholar , the first - term governor presented a deliberate visual counterpoint to Obama .
His folksy speech last evening is meeting with mixed reviews .
But with GOP politicians already jockeying for the 2012 primary , Jindal is emerging as a top contender .
“ From the insiders I ’m talking to , Jindal ’s in the top three , right next to [ Sarah ] Palin and [ Mitt ] Romney .
He ’s the rock star of the Republican Party right now , ” says Jeff Crouere , the former executive director of the Louisiana GOP and host of daily political talk show Ringside Politics .
“ Whenever I concentrated long enough to begin prayer , I felt some type of physical force distracting me , ” Jindal reflected .
“ It was as if something was pushing down on my chest , making it very hard for me to breathe … ”
But as the country gets acquainted with the Bayou ’s boy wonder , the stranger details of Jindal ’s religious or personal background remain largely unknown , even among the Republican grassroots .
How many Americans know that Jindal boasted of participating in an exorcism that purged the spirit of Satan from a college girlfriend ?
So far , Jindal ’s tale of “ beating a demon ” remains behind the subscription wall of New Oxford Review , an obscure Catholic magazine ; only a few major blogs have seized on the story .
Born in Baton Rouge in 1971 , Jindal rarely visited his parents ’ homeland .
His birth name was Piyush Jindal .
When he was four years old , Piyush changed his name to “ Bobby ” after becoming mesmerized by an episode of The Brady Bunch .
Jindal later wrote that he began considering converting to Catholicism during high school after “ being touched by the love and simplicity of a Christian girl who dreamt of becoming a Supreme Court justice so she could stop her country from ‘ killing unborn babies . ’ ”
After watching a short black - and - white film on the crucifixion of Christ , Jindal claimed he “ realized that if the Gospel stories were true , if Christ really was the son of God , it was arrogant of me to reject Him and question the gift of salvation . ”
Jindal ’s Hindu parents were non-plussed .
“ My parents have never truly accepted my conversion and still see my faith as a negative that overshadows my accomplishments , ” he wrote .
“ They were hurt and felt I was rejecting them by accepting Christianity …
I long for the day when my parents understand , respect and possibly accept my faith .
For now I am satisfied that they accept me . ”
( In a subsequent interview with Little India , Jindal claimed his parents were “ very supportive .
They felt like it was important that I was embracing God . ” )
During his years at Brown University , Jindal pursued his Catholic faith with unbridled zeal .
Jindal became emotionally involved with a classmate named Susan who had overcome skin cancer and struggled to cope with the suicide of a close friend .
Jindal reflected in an article for a Catholic magazine ( called “ Beating a Demon : Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare ” ) that “ sulfuric ” scents hovered over Susan everywhere she went .
In the middle of a prayer meeting , Jindal claimed that Susan collapsed and began convulsing on the floor .
His prayer partners gathered together on the floor , holding hands and shouting , “ Satan , I command you to leave this woman ! ”
While under the supposed control of satanic demons , Susan lashed out at Jindal and his friends .
“ Whenever I concentrated long enough to begin prayer , I felt some type of physical force distracting me , ” Jindal reflected .
“ It was as if something was pushing down on my chest , making it very hard for me to breathe … I began to think that the demon would only attack me if I tried to pray or fight back ; thus , I resigned myself to leaving it alone in an attempt to find peace for myself . ”
Toward the conclusion of what Jindal called “ the tremendous battle between the Susan we knew and loved and some strange and evil force , ” Jindal and his friends forced Susan to read passages from the Bible .
“ She choked on certain passages and could not finish the sentence ‘ Jesus is Lord . ’
Over and over , she repeated " Jesus is L..L..LL , " often ending in profanities , ” Jindal wrote .
Finally , evil gave way to the light .
“ Just as suddenly as she went into the trance , Susan suddenly reappeared and claimed ‘ Jesus is Lord . ’
With an almost comical smile , Susan then looked up as if awakening from a deep sleep and asked , ‘ Has something happened ? ’ ”
During the 2006 gubernatorial campaign , the campaign of Jindal ’s Democratic opponent , incumbent Gov. Kathleen Blanco , attempted to inject his religious views into the race by running an ad promoting a website called JindalonReligion.com , which featured his essay about participating in an exorcism .
However , Jindal immediately fired back , denouncing the commercial as an assault on his faith and on the deeply religious culture of Louisiana .
“ Jindal turned that one around and tried to play the victim before [ the Democrats ] could get any traction , ” Crouere told me .
“ Then the Blanco campaign just backed off ”
Though Crouere is a Republican , he harbors strong doubts about Jindal .
To him , the young governor is still too green for the national stage .
“ I just find it odd that the GOP seems to have as its savior a guy who has been in Congress for three years and governor for one year , ” Crouere said .
“ The same criticism that was leveled against Obama for being untested could easily be leveled against Jindal . ”
Because Obama entered the presidential campaign without an extensive political track record , the video histrionics of his pastor , Rev. Jeremiah “ God Damn America ” Wright , remained unexposed until the middle of the Democratic primary .
Could similar exposure of Jindal ’s tales of “ spiritual warfare ” complicate his ascendancy as well ?
“ The Louisiana Democrats do n’t really have their act together , and were n’t able to get the word out , ” Crouere remarked .
“ I still do n’t think a lot of people are aware of the nature of Jindal ’s religious background . ”

Trees in the western United States are dying twice as quickly as they did three decades ago and scientists think global warming is to blame .
In their surveys , ecologists found that a wide range of tree species were dying including pines , firs and hemlocks and at a variety of altitudes .
The changes can have serious long - term effects including reducing biodiversity and turning western forests into a source of carbon dioxide as they die and decompose .
That could lead to a runaway effect that speeds up climate change .
" The trend was pervasive across a wide variety of forest types , across all elevations , in trees of all sizes and among major species , " said Phillip van Mantgem of the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
" At the same time , the rate of new establishment of trees did n't change . "
If these trends continued , he said , forests will become sparser and store less carbon .
" It introduces the possibility that western forests could be come net sources or carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , further speeding up global warming . "
The forest survey , carried out by a team of scientists led by van Mantgem , is published tomorrow in the journal Science .
It showed that death rates of trees overall had more than doubled since 1955 .
In the Pacific north - west and British Columbia , deaths had doubled in 17 years .
In California , the death rate took 25 years to double .
The work is the first large - scale study of death rates in forests or temperate regions .
Much of the world 's population – in North America , Europe , most of China and large portions of Russia – live near temperate forests so what happens in these forests has global importance , according to Jerry Franklin , a professor of forest resources at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study .
The researchers think that warming global temperature is the most likely cause for the dramatic decline .
From the 1970s to 2006 , the period that includes most of the surveyors ' tree data , the average annual temperature of the western US increased by 0.3C - 0.4C , and increased even more at the higher elevations that are normally covered in forests .
" While this may not sound like much , it has been enough to reduce winter snowpack , cause earlier snowmelt , and lengthen the summer drought , " said van Mantgem .
This longer summer drought means less water for trees and it also encourages the growth of insects and diseases that attack the plants .
Recent outbreaks of tree - killing bark beetles in the western US have already been linked to warmer temperatures .
Mark Harmon , a forest ecologist at Oregon State University , said another concern from the study is that a climate feedback loop could develop from the increased death rate of trees .
As temperatures rise , the smaller forests will not only absorb less CO2 but will emit more greenhouse gases ias the dead material decays .
This , in turn , would lead to even higher levels of global warming .
The data for the research was gathered by several generations of scientists counting trees over more than 50 years .
It included forests in Oregon , Washington , California , Arizona , Colorado , New Mexico and south - western British Columbia .
All were older than 200 years , with many being established more than 500 years ago .
Death rates in old forests tend to be more stable since they mostly contain very old trees .
" With many of our long - lived trees that grow very large , each year as they become larger and older , the probability of living the next year increases , " said Franklin .
" You might imagine that , as a tree gets larger and older , the probability of death would increase but it does not – it decreases for many of our species . "
In most forests , it is the youngest trees that are most likely to die .
" Often they are shaded by larger , taller trees and so they grow more slowly , " said Nathan Stephenson of the USGS .
" They are less resilient to changes in the environment and they also do n't have as well - developed root systems so , if they run into a drought , they 're more likely than a large tree to suffer . "
In the latest survey , the research team found that trees of all ages were dying more quickly .
The team also ruled out factors such as overcrowding , forest fragmentation or air pollution .
The main air pollutant that harms trees in the western US , for example , is ozone .
" In California , where most of our forests are concentrated , ozone is fairly severe , " said Stephenson .
" Over the time period of the study , there was no trend in ozone and it might even have declined slightly . "

At his news conference yesterday Gordon Brown was asked how long the bank rescue scheme would remain in place .
" I think your point is what is the temporary nature of this , " Brown replied .
" As quickly as possible we want to get back to a situation where the bank shares are held in the private sector , and we have no ambition to hold on to shares longer than is necessary . "
But a few hours later , when the City minister Lord Myners was making a statement in the Lords about the government 's plans , he said that one aspect of the scheme could be in place for almost 10 years .
He was talking about the proposal to allow banks to insure themselves against bad debts .
In response to a question from Lord Lamont , he said :
The duration of the policy will be important , because we need a policy that will take financial markets through this economic downturn and beyond the next cycle , so we are probably talking about a policy duration of no fewer than five years and probably no longer than eight or nine years .
Myners – who as Paul Myners was chairman of the Guardian Media Group – also gave some indication of the complexity involved in setting up an asset protection scheme for the banks .
Establishing the asset protection scheme will take six to eight weeks .
It will involve a huge amount of data analysis .
I envisage well over a billion items of individual data reviewed for each bank that approached us in that connection .
We will be drawing on the support of external advisers – accountants , actuaries and lawyers .
Nothing 's official just yet , but Macworld is reporting that Intel will be rolling out an eight - core Xeon processor at the International Solid - State Circuits Conference in San Francisco next month , marking the company 's first foray into octa-core processors , and paving the way for 16 - core systems using two of the chips .
Unfortunately , there are n't many more details than that , with the only other word being that it 'll be a 16 - thread processor , and be manufactured using a 45 - nanometer process .
As Macworld notes , however , it does seem likely that the processor in question is the Nehalem - EP seen on the roadmap above , which is based on the Tylersburg platform -- the first product of Intel 's throw - a - dart - at - a - map naming scheme . [ Via 9 to 5 Mac
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In the wake of a highly publicized chimpanzee attack , the U.S. House made its first official move to ban humans from owning primates as pets .
Travis , seen here as a younger chimp , was fatally shot by police after attacking a woman , authorities say .
The House overwhelmingly voted in favor of passing the Captive Primate Safety Act on Tuesday , which prohibits people from buying or transporting primates across state lines to keep as pets .
This legislation amended the Lacey Act , which had only applied to wildlife and fish .
The Humane Society of the United States applauded the bill , which passed by a vote of 323 to 95 .
" There is no reason for any private citizen to keep a primate as a pet , and this trade is driven by unscrupulous dealers who sell primates across state lines for thousands of dollars , " said Wayne Pacelle , president and CEO of the HSUS .
Last week , Charla Nash , 55 , was left with severe trauma to her face , scalp and hands after her neighbor 's pet chimpanzee , Travis , mauled her in Stamford , Connecticut .
Police shot Travis to halt the attack , and he later died of gunshot wounds .
Nash was brought to the famed Cleveland Clinic , where the nation 's first face transplant was performed .
Doctors there are contemplating whether to offer her a similar procedure .
The bill was introduced by U.S. Reps .
Earl Blumenauer , D - Oregon , and Mark Kirk , R - Illinois , who said it would protect animals and humans from similar attacks .
" As the tragic attack in Connecticut shows us , The Captive Primate Safety
Act is necessary , common - sense legislation for the welfare of humans and animals , " Blumenauer said .
" Make no mistake , this bill will protect communities and ensure the humane treatment of these animals . "
" It is inhumane to cage primates in private homes .
Besides the animal cruelty concerns , the interstate movement of pet primates creates serious public health and safety risks .
The Captive Primate Safety
Act takes important steps to address these concerns , " Kirk said .
As cute as they can be , primates can inflict serious injuries and spread life - threatening disease , according to the Humane Society .
The average pet owner cannot provide for their basic social and physical needs in captivity , says the organization , which estimates 15,000 monkeys and other primates are living as either pets or in private zoos .
" As infants , they are fascinating , " said Beth Preiss , who directs the organization 's Exotic Pet Campaign .
" But they grow up and become dangerous to manage . "
The bill moves now to the Senate , where Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana will lead the effort to pass the legislation .
CNN 's Lauren Kornreich contributed to this report .

Drinking three cups of coffee a day ' shrinks women 's breasts '
Storm in a D - cup :
Too much coffee can reduce a woman 's breast size , scientists say
Scientists have discovered that drinking just three cups of coffee a day can make women 's breasts shrink .
Nearly 300 women were surveyed about their bust measurements and how many cups of coffee they drank in an average day .
According to researchers , three cups a day was enough to start making breasts shrink , with the effects increasing for every cup drunk .
They said there was a clear link between drinking coffee and smaller breasts as around half of all women possess a gene that has been shown to link breast size to coffee intake .
' Drinking coffee can have a major effect on breast size , ' said Helena Jernstroem , a lecturer in experimental oncology at Lund University in Sweden .
' Coffee - drinking women do not have to worry their breasts will shrink to nothing overnight .
They will get smaller , but the breasts are n't just going to disappear . '
' However , anyone who thinks they can tell which women are coffee drinkers just from their bra measurements will be disappointed .
' The problem is that there are two measures for a bra , the cup size and the girth , so you would n't be able to tell . '
It 's not all bad news for women however as the researchers also found that regular hits of caffeine can help to cut the risk of developing breast cancer .
Scientists said that the effect of coffee is related to its impact on estrogens - the female sex hormones .
Some substances in coffee can change a woman 's metabolism so she acquires a better configuration of various estrogens , therefore lowering the potential risk .
But women with bigger breasts that contain more mammary glands are at a higher risk , the scientists added .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The U.S. recession will last two full years , with gross domestic product falling a cumulative 5 % , said Nouriel Roubini , chairman of RGE Monitor .
Roubini was one of the first economists to predict the recession and the credit crunch stemming from the housing bubble .
For 2009 , Roubini predicts GDP will fall 3.4 % , with declines in every quarter of the year .
The unemployment rate should peak at about 9 % in early 2010 , he said .
Consumer prices will fall about 2 % in 2009 .
Housing prices will probably overshoot , dropping 44 % from the peak through mid-2010 .
" The U.S. economy cannot avoid a severe contraction that has already started and the policy response will have only a limited and delayed effect that will be felt more in 2010 than 2009 , " he said .
On other terrorism issues , Mr. Obama suggested in the interview that his approach might be more measured .
He said the closing of the detention center at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , which once seemed to be an early top objective , was not likely to happen during the first 100 days of his administration .
“ It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realize , ” Mr. Obama said , “ and we are going to get it done .
But part of the challenge that you have is that you have a bunch of folks that have been detained , many of whom who may be very dangerous , who have not been put on trial or have not gone through some adjudication . ”
Mr. Obama has in the past condemned waterboarding , and he was explicit in the interview that he regarded the use of the technique , in which a subject is made to believe that he is drowning , as torture , prohibited by statute .
And the president - elect said he disagreed with Vice President Dick Cheney , who has defended the practice .
“ Vice President Cheney , I think , continues to defend what he calls extraordinary measures or procedures when it comes to interrogations , ” Mr. Obama said , “ and from my view , waterboarding is torture . ”
Mr. Obama ’s choice for attorney general , Eric H. Holder Jr. , is widely expected to be asked about his views on these issues at his confirmation hearing this week .
Associates say Mr. Holder is open to prosecutions based on specific accusations but is less eager to use the criminal law to commence wide - ranging inquiries .
Before being chosen for the Obama cabinet , he said there should be “ a reckoning ” over Bush administration policies .
Lawyers who represented Bush administration officials over the years expressed little surprise that Mr. Obama ’s legal and national security team had lost whatever appetite it might have had for delving into alleged misdeeds of the Bush years .
“ A new president does n’t want to look vengeful , ” said a former Bush White House lawyer , Bradford A. Berenson , who was a Harvard law classmate of Mr. Obama and has represented administration figures as a private lawyer , “ and the last thing a new administration wants to do is spend its time and energy rehashing the perceived sins of the old one .
Abstract
Floating - point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by many people .
This is rather surprising , because floating - point is ubiquitous in computer systems :
Almost every language has a floating - point datatype ; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating - point accelerators ; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating - point algorithms from time to time ; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating - point exceptions such as overflow .
This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating - point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems .
It begins with background on floating - point representation and rounding error , continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard , and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point .

Carbonate minerals show up as green in the image of Nili Fossae Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has finally spotted rocks on the Red Planet that bear carbonate minerals .
The ingredients needed to make the rocks are very evident , so their absence had been a major puzzle .
One theory to explain the omission is the idea that water on Mars has been too acidic to allow carbonates .
The rocks ' identification now shows these harsh waters have not dominated all parts of Mars - and that is good news for the search for life .
" You want to get an environment that is basically as clement as possible , that 's not difficult to live in , " explained Bethany Ehlmann from Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It 's difficult to live in a highly acidic environment ; it 's difficult to live in a very salty environment .
If you have neutral waters then that presents a less difficult environment for microbial life , " she told BBC News .
Weathered rocks Ehlmann and colleagues have been detailing the discovery here at the American Geophysical Union 's ( AGU ) Fall Meeting 2008 .
A paper explaining their findings is also being published in the journal Science .
That means there are some places we can go and look for evidence for past life - if it ever existed
Richard Zurek
MRO project scientist
The carbonate minerals were detected in a mid-latitude region called Nili Fossae , on the western edge of the Isidis impact basin .
The landscape viewed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) is believed to have formed more than 3.6 billion years ago .
Carbonates are produced in the weathering process that sees water with dissolved carbon dioxide re-fashion the original chemistry of rocks .
The carbonates - in this case , magnesium carbonate - precipitate out of solution .
On Earth , carbonates are usually associated with great marine sediments like limestone and chalk ; although the scientists here stressed the Martian carbonates would look nothing like that .
Life hunt Previous data from orbiting spacecraft and from the robot rovers on the surface of Mars has revealed salt - rich , acidic waters affected much of the planet in more modern times .
Given that carbonates dissolve quickly in low pH solutions , it is possible that many large carbonate formations created on early Mars may simply have disappeared ; and this could explain why it has taken so long to find a carbonate signature .
But the MRO discovery shows that some areas of the Red Planet must have been untouched by these harsher conditions .
That makes Nili Fossae an interesting place for future Mars missions to explore .
" If you preserve carbonates on the surface then you know carbon - bearing compounds can survive in some environments on the planet , " said Richard Zurek , the project scientist on MRO .
" That means there are some places we can go and look for evidence for past life - if it ever existed . "
Interestingly , Nili Fossae lost out in the site selection contest to choose the landing location of the next Nasa rover , called the Mars Science Laboratory ( MSL ) .
The vehicle 's launch recently slipped from 2009 to 2011 and the scientists at AGU said it was possible the contest outcome could now be reviewed .
However , they also said there would be other opportunities to visit Nili Fossae .
" MSL is not the last lander that we intend to send to the planet .
With this diversity of environments , there are many places to explore , " said Dr Zurek .

Tonight , Duke University held a vigil for Gaza .
I was invited to speak , even after certain campus groups said they were displeased at the choice of speakers , saying they found my comments offensive last time I spoke .
Here is a rough copy of my speech : Imagine if you will a land teeming with refugees ; a land of the dispossessed , closed off from the outside world ; where smuggling is often the only source of subsistence ; where families who are not disappeared - are on the brink of starvation ; surrounded by an army and bombarded by that army .
The year was 1943 .
The place : the Warsaw Ghetto .
The description is hauntingly familiar .
But it is now 2009 .
And this is Gaza .
As we speak tonight , more than 800 Palestinians have and 14 Israelis have lost their lives over the course of the past two weeks .
17 mosques have been destroyed , a church seriously damaged ;
Over 12 medics and a journalist killed ; ambulances ; schools ; houses ; women , men , children .
In fact - entire families - entire families have been eliminated from existence .
This is Gaza .
Roughly the size of this nation ’s great capital , Washington DC , it is s closed in on all sides .
There is no escape .
There is not entry .
And it ’s residents - already stateless after 40 years of occupation and a majority of them refugees - are at once being blockaded and bombarded by land , sea , and sky : it is a situation that is unprecedented in modern history .
Gaza - where acute malnutrition rates , after 3 years of Israeli blockade , are now on scale with the poorest nations in the southern Sahara , according to the UN ; where half of all Palestinian families eat one meal a day ;
Where the siege has killed not only lives , but hopes and dreams and futures .
Today in Gaza , no where is safe .
That is what friends and family have been repeating to me day after day after day for the past two weeks .
They are trapped , terrorized , and traumatized .
The parliament building down the street from my parents ’ home ; the mosque around the corner ; the university my cousin attends ; the ambulance my friend drives ; the pier where we get our fish ; the playground my son used to play in ; the farm my colleague 's father grew ; the restaurant I had my evening coffees at .
Everything living , beautiful , and ordinary has been a target .
"
You do n't know who is alive , you do n’t know what is a target next ; you feel you are in a trap , and where do you run to .. the Israeli navy is shelling from the sea , the F - 16s from the sky , the tanks from the ground ... where to ? " my friend repeated again and again .
This is Gaza .
I have learned that my comments are considered offensive to some .
For this , I do NOT apologize .
Sometimes , we need to be offended in order to wake up to the brutal realities around us ; realities which we helped create - with our taxes , with our votes , with our silence ;
And I say : Occupation is not only offensive ; it is lethal ; The United Nations has described what is happening in Gaza as a Crime Against Humanity - both in terms of its Deliberateness ; its Scope ; and its Disproportionality That an occupied territory - and yes - Gaza is still recognized as occupied - is not only subject to a deliberate siege after free and fair elections - depriving an already impoverished and dispossessed people` intentionally of electricity , aid trucks , and medicines , is then bombed , is not only unfathomable , it is indefensible .
It is incumbent upon all of us to speak out for peace and justice for all .
For Israel can only achieve the security is seeks by providing that same security to Palestinians .
In order to realize a sustainable resolution to this conflict , we must not only call for an end to arms : whether they are Palestinian rockets or Israeli laser guided missiles .
But we also also address the underlying cause of it all :
We must demand an end to Israel ’s siege and illegal occupation of Gaza , the West Bank , and East Jerusalem .
This is an obligation , not a concession .
We cannot continue to speak of it as an event occurring in a vacuum ; or as though the firing of rockets onto Israeli towns was simply an event on its own , without context .
As though Gazans were not dying a slow death by way of siege before this ; or suffering under occupation throughout .
It is about the denial of basic Palestinians rights .
the right to statehood ; the rights of refugees to return to their homes ; the rights of family to reside together and to visit one another ; the right to travel freely ; to receive medical treatment ; to education ; to a childhood free of violence ; the right to worship ; the right to live free of occupation and siege .
Palestinians must be allowed to realize their most basic human rights - freedom and self - determination , the same concepts this country was founded on .
The United States must change its long - standing policy of blind support for Israel .
It must become an even - handed broker in this conflict , addressing Palestinian needs for justice , equality , and yes , security just as they do Israel ’s .
It must demand that Israel end its illegal occupation , running on 40 years , of the Gaza Strip , the West Bank , and East Jerusalem .
And friends do n’t let friends run an occupation .
I end with a rough translation of a poem by the late Mahmoud Darwish , titled , " silence for Gaza" MAHMOUD DARWISH
" Gaza has no throat .
Its pores are the ones that speak in sweat , blood , and fires .
Hence the enemy hates it to death and fears it to criminality , and tries to sink it into the sea ...
And hence its relatives and friends love it with a coyness that amounts to jealousy and fear at times , because Gaza is the brutal lesson … and the shining example for enemies and friends alike .
Gaza is not the most beautiful city .
Its shore is not bluer than the shores of Arab cities .
Its oranges are not the most beautiful in the Mediterranean basin .
Gaza is not the richest city .
It is not the most elegant or the biggest , but it equals the history of an entire homeland , because it is more ugly , impoverished , miserable , and vicious in the eyes of enemies .
Because it is the most capable , among us , of disturbing the enemy ’s mood and his comfort .
Because it is his nightmare .
Because it is mined with oranges ; children without a childhood ; old men without old age ; and women without desires .
Because of all this it is the most beautiful , the purest and richest among us and the one most worthy of love . "
MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif . —
With sales of computers deteriorating by the day , the PC industry ’s dominant players — Microsoft and Intel — have arrived at the stark realization that the slump in sales could last a long time , perhaps years .
“ We are certainly in the midst of a once - in - a - lifetime set of economic conditions , ” Microsoft ’s chief executive , Steven A. Ballmer , told investors Thursday in a conference call to discuss the company ’s dismal second - quarter financial results .
“ Our model is not for a quick rebound .
Our model is things go down , and then they reset .
The economy shrinks . ”
To help it cope with that lower base of demand , Microsoft said that it would lay off up to 5,000 employees , or about 5 percent of its work force — the first significant cuts in the company ’s 34 - year history .
The layoffs follow a rare decline in sales of Microsoft ’s Windows operating system for personal and business computers in the second fiscal quarter .
Net income for the period , which ended Dec. 31 , fell 11 percent to $ 4.17 billion .
Other major players in the personal computer industry are reporting similar drops in demand and paring their work forces to adjust .

Advertisement Casualties have been pouring into over - stretched hospitals in the Gaza Strip as Israel presses on with its offensive against Palestinian militant groups .
Palestinian medical officials say at least 90 people , including many civilians and 26 children , have been killed since the ground assault began .
There are currently heavy clashes on the northern outskirts of Gaza City .
Israel has confirmed that three of its soldiers were accidentally killed by their own side in northern Gaza .
The soldiers from the elite Golani Brigade were hit by shellfire from an Israeli tank and a number of other soldiers were wounded .
Intense diplomatic efforts are under way to resolve the crisis , but Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who is on a mission to the region , has appealed for a halt to the violence to allow in humanitarian aid .
According to Palestinian medical sources , more than 500 people have been killed and some 2,500 wounded since the Israeli operation began 10 days ago .
These figures cannot be independently verified .
Five Israelis have been killed , including one soldier during the ground offensive .
' Mainly civilians '
There were reports of fierce fighting in northern Gaza as news began to emerge of the scale of the problems facing medical staff .
Map : Gaza incursion - Week Two Analysis : Israeli pride at a cost
In pictures : Gaza offensive BBC News in Arabic Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert , one of two foreign doctors working at Gaza 's biggest hospital , al - Shifa , said they had received a " new wave " of very serious injuries on Monday .
" We have many amputations , head injuries , and of course for a hospital in this situation ... it 's extremely difficult to handle , " he told the BBC .
He warned that the hospital would be unable to operate much longer unless it received fresh medical supplies .
" People are dying now because of lack of supplies .
We have all operating rooms full .
Yesterday we were operating on two patients in one operating room ...
This is a complete disaster " .
Israel has insisted that it is not targeting civilians and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields by operating in populated areas .
But Dr Gilbert said the overwhelming majority of casualties he had treated were civilians .
" Among all the hundreds we have seen so far , we have seen two fighters , " he said , adding that women and children alone made up 25 % of the death toll , and 45 % of the wounded .
Civilians on the move
The Israeli army said it had hit 40 targets in Gaza on Monday , including smuggling tunnels and the homes of Hamas officials .
One million people are without electricity .
Crucially the hospitals in Gaza are running on emergency generators - this in my book amounts to a humanitarian crisis
UN spokesman Christopher Gunness
Fear for homes amid Gaza danger Aid worker diary : Part eight Hamas set for bitter battle
But information about what is happening is limited as Israel has barred foreign reporters from entering Gaza .
An Israeli army spokesman said three soldiers were killed and three were severely wounded when a tank shell hit a " structure " where the soldiers were located .
" Twenty additional soldiers were lightly to moderately wounded in the same incident , " he added .
After night fell on Monday , Israeli troops were reported to be battling Palestinian militants on the outskirts of the northern Shujaiya district of Gaza City .
Hamas and Islamic Jihad said their fighters had engaged Israeli soldiers with machine guns and rockets .
Residents reported hearing loud explosions and heavy gunfire .
One report said Israeli forces had to use artillery and helicopter gunships to drive back the Palestinian fighters .
Elsewhere , Israeli tanks were moving towards the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza , according to the Reuters news agency .
Fighting was earlier witnessed around Beit Hanoun and the Jabaliya refugee camp .
An Israeli military spokesman said the assault was going according to plan The BBC's Hamada Abu Qammar in Gaza City said residents on the outskirts were heading into the centre , seeking safe places away from the fighting .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said Hamas had suffered a " hard blow " , but insisted the offensive would continue .
" We still have n't reached our objectives , " he told Israeli MPs .
A senior Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip , Mahmoud Zahhar , told Palestinians in a televised address that they were headed for " victory " against Israel .
Israelis " have legitimised the murder of their own children by killing the children of Palestine " , he said .
The Israeli army said Palestinian militants had fired 20 missiles into southern Israel on Monday .
Humanitarian crisis
For the people of Gaza , living conditions are deteriorating sharply .
Supplies of fuel , food , water , and wheat are said to be running desperately low .

A spokesman for Unrwa , the UN aid agency for the Palestinians , said food was urgently needed and people were facing " serious hunger " , with supplies for just 48 hours .
" One million people are without electricity .
Crucially the hospitals in Gaza are running on emergency generators .
This in my book amounts to a humanitarian crisis , " Christopher Gunness told the BBC .
Israel said it had allowed a convoy of 80 lorries carrying food and medicines through Gaza 's southern frontier .
Away from the front line , diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting in the Gaza Strip have been moving into high gear .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy held talks with Palestinian leaders in the West Bank town of Ramallah at the start of a series of meetings across the Middle East .
In remarks broadcast on French radio , he " condemned " the Israeli ground offensive , but said Hamas had also " acted in an irresponsible and unforgivable manner " by ending a six - month ceasefire with Israel and resuming firing rockets .
Decision of arms not diplomacy Brown urges end to Gaza violence US President George W Bush also blamed the current situation on Hamas militants and said he understood " Israel 's desire to protect itself " .
An EU delegation held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni in Jerusalem , calling for a " cease - fire at the earliest possible moment " .
But Ms Livni appeared to rebuff the call , saying : " When Israel is being targeted , Israel is going to retaliate . "
At the UN in New York , Arab ministers are pushing for a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is expected to attend a meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday to discuss the situation .

Mr Webb said he would give the £ 200 to charity A Sheffield man who lent a penniless Australian tourist £ 5 to pay for a ferry trip in 1969 has been repaid his debt nearly 40 years later .
While Jim Webb was out , a card and £ 200 was hand delivered to his home by Gary Fenton , to repay the money he borrowed when they met in Ostend , Belgium .
A note inside read : " To Jim Webb , a good man .
From Gary Fenton , a tardy payer of debts . "
Mr Webb , 72 , has appealed for Mr Fenton to get back in touch .
Mr Webb and a friend were travelling around Europe in April 1969 when they met the Australian traveller , then in his early 20s , at a ferry port in Ostend .
He said : " A young man came up to us and said he had n't got enough money to get back to England and would we lend him £ 5 and he'd repay us as soon as he could afford it . "
The three men travelled back to England and when they parted Mr Fenton took Mr Webb 's address , but he never heard from him .
In this day and age promises are made and promises are broken and you lose your faith in human nature
Jim Webb
Then on Sunday , he returned to his home in Bradway to find the surprise card .
Mr Webb said : " I was quite emotional when I read it .
In this day and age promises are made and promises are broken and you lose your faith in human nature .
" This was a lovely gesture .
Forty years is a long time - it must have been preying on his mind that he had n't repaid his debt .
" He said he was giving me £ 200 as that was £ 5 for every year that had gone by . "
Mr Webb said the card explained how Mr Fenton , who now lived in Sydney , had come across his address while looking through some old papers .
His note said he had decided to pay him a visit and repay his debt while on a trip to London .
Mr Webb , who is giving the £ 200 to charity , said : " He did n't leave an address or telephone number , just an email address which I have tried but so far I have n't heard back .
" I am very sorry I was not in on Sunday ... he would have been very welcome here .
Hopefully we will be able to make contact , it would be wonderful to meet up again . "

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Netflix and LG Electronics said on Sunday that LG will soon introduce TV sets that can screen Netflix movies directly from the Web without an external box .
Workers at an LG booth set up a display featuring the 50PG60 television , a 50 - inch 1080 p plasma TV with a single layer design , as they prepare for the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , Nevada January 6 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Steve Marcus
Last year , the U.S. DVD rental company and the Korean electronics giant launched set - top boxes and Blu-ray DVD players equipped with the same Netflix software .
Netflix , which is seeking to equip all home - entertainment screens with instant movie - viewing capability , also announced other partnerships , including one with Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 to embed the movie software in its game consoles .
Netflix subscribers who buy one of these devices can hook it up to their TVs to watch movies that can be downloaded from the Internet instantly , as part of their monthly rental plan .
Subscribers can choose from about 12,000 movie titles and television episodes for instant viewing -- an option the company introduced in 2007 .
Netflix ’s entire library consists of more than 100,000 titles .
The new high - definition LG televisions , which will be on view at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week , are targeted at those Netflix customers who want the convenience of Internet - to - TV movies without the clutter of a set - top box or an additional DVD player .
Some people “ do not like to be encumbered with a rack of boxes around the TV , ” Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said .
Swasey added Netflix is working on similar partnerships with other gadget makers , but declined to mention names .
“ The goal for Netflix is to be ubiquitous ... ( on ) whatever device connects Internet to the TV . ”
But the Los Gatos , California - based company , whose trademark red envelopes are shipped to nearly 9 million subscribers , has no immediate plans to tie up with mobile phone companies , Swasey said , despite the growing popularity of smart phones like Apple ’s iPhone and Research in Motion ’s BlackBerry .
“ There ’s a limited market for people who want to watch a 2 1/2 - hour movie on a 2 - inch screen , ” he said .
LG aims to begin selling the Netflix - enabled LG TVs this spring , said Tim Alessi , LG Electronics USA ’s director of product development .
These televisions , which use broadband Internet technology , will be available in four models -- LCDs with 42 - inch and 47 - inch screens , and plasma TVs with 50 - inch and 60 - inch screens , he said .
Alessi did not disclose a price for these new TVs , but said the company would charge a “ small premium ” over the typical cost of similar high - definition televisions .
On average , these TV sets cost about $ 1,000 at a store like Wal - Mart .
“ The main point is to add a lot of value for the consumer , ” he said , adding that they were encouraged by sales of the Netflix - ready set - top boxes and Blu-ray DVD players .
If anything , Alessi was optimistic that the economic recession might help TV sales , especially as people look for cheaper entertainment .
“ When economic times are tougher , people tend to stay home more , through ‘ stay - cations ’ or cocooning , and in those environments , TVs tend to do better , ” he said .
Under the terms of the Bill , new ' combined authorities ' , made up or two or more local authority areas will be created .
They will control economic development , regeneration and transport policy .
They will not be directly elected , and the rules on appointments to the quangos will be made up by the Government .
Across the nation , people are beginning to reconsider our marijuana laws .

Marijuana remains as available as ever through an unregulated illegal market .
Enforcement of marijuana laws costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year – precious public safety resources that could be directed toward more important priorities and more effective policies .

Downadup , the superworm that attacks a patched vulnerability in Microsoft Windows , is making exponential gains if estimates from researchers at F - Secure are accurate .
They show 6.5 million new infections in the past four days , bringing the total number of machines it has compromised to almost 9 million .
The astronomical growth stunned some researchers , although others cautioned the numbers could be inflated since the counting of infected computers is by no means an exact science .
Most agreed F - Secure 's estimate was certainly plausible and if it proved to be correct , represented a major development in the world of cyberthreats .
" This thing has gotten way out of hand , " said Paul Ferguson , a security researcher for anti-virus provider Trend Micro who has spent the past several weeks tracking the worm 's progress .
" It seems pretty spectacular to me that there could be that much growth . "
A confluence of factors are responsible for the growth of Downadup , which also goes by the name Conficker .
For one , the underlying vulnerability allows for self - replicating attacks in the 2000 , XP , and Server 2003 versions of Windows .
And for another , the malware authors have cleverly designed exploits that spread via flash and network drives , online trojans , and social engineering features that allow it to spread like wildfire within a local network once a single machine is compromised .
Another important contribution to the outbreak seems to be the legions of administrators and users of Windows machines who have failed to heed repeated admonitions to update .
Despite Microsoft releasing an emergency patch for the vulnerability almost three months ago , nearly one in three Windows machines have yet to apply it , according to research from security provider Qualys .
Some Skepticism
Not all security watchers are convinced there really are 9 million machines infected by Downadup .
Paul Royal , chief scientist with anti-botnet company Damballa , said his researchers have counted only about 500,000 unique IP addresses connecting to Downadup 's master control server .
That would imply an average of 18 infected machines behind each address , a number he says is unlikely .
The skepticism prompted F - Secure researchers to explain its methodology for the mind - boggling number .
By infiltrating Downadup 's control channel and analyzing logs of machines that connected , researchers discovered a counter believed to show the number of other PCs the compromised machine has infected .
After creating a script that totaled all those numbers together , F - Secure deduced 8.97 million machines have been compromised , up from 2.4 million on Tuesday .
In the midst of economic chaos , Warren Buffett recently made a bold prediction .
He said that now is the time to buy American stocks .
Of course , this call seems utterly insane .
Banks are failing , the credit markets are deadlocked , unemployment is skyrocketing , and there 's likely to be terrible news for months .
On the other hand , this is Warren Buffett , and he 's made these sorts of predictions before .
1974 : Stagflation
The years 1973 and 1974 were two very bad ones for the market .
OPEC had started flexing its muscles , causing oil to quadruple .
This resulted in a long recession , with inflation spiking to 12.3 % in 1974 , while real GDP growth fell by 0.5 % .
America experienced stagflation -- the ugly combination of a recession and high inflation rates -- and people were terrified .
The situation was even worse in the United Kingdom , where the government was bailing out banks after real estate crashed .
Over those two years , the S&P 500 plunged by 42 % .
It was then , on Nov. 1 , 1974 , at the height of the pessimism , that Buffett made his first well - publicized bullish market call .
He noted that he was well aware that the world was in a mess , but that stocks were simply too cheap .
" If you 're only worried about corporate profits , panic or depression , these things do n't bother me at these prices . "
To be totally clear , Buffett made one of the most direct predictions of his entire career : " Now is the time to invest and get rich . "
Buffett himself was buying shares of The Washington Post ( NYSE : WPO ) and advertising agency Interpublic ( NYSE : IPG ) .
It worked out pretty well for him .
The market jumped 32 % in 1975 , and another 19 % the next year .
Even today , the Dow Jones Industrial Average 's 38 % gain in 1975 stands up as its biggest increase since 1955 .
1979 : An oil crisis
That excellent performance was followed by two poor years .
Once again , we were experiencing double - digit inflation and falling GDP growth .
Again , we were going through an oil crisis , this one coming in the wake of the Iranian Revolution .
As a result , when Buffett made his next call on Aug. 6 , 1979 , the Dow Jones Average was actually trading lower than it was at the end of 1975 .
This time , Buffett noted that stocks were far more attractive than bonds .
He believed that pension managers , who were piling into bonds yielding 9.5 % , were investing using the rearview mirror .
They were avoiding the equities that had recently lost them money .
But Buffett recognized that the underlying businesses were actually performing well .
A combination of falling stock prices and improving business fundamentals made stocks an attractive investment .
Buffett figured that stocks were probably offering long - term returns of 13 % or better .
He bought oil producer Hess ( NYSE : HES ) , GEICO , and General Foods , which later became part of Kraft ( NYSE : KFT ) .
This time , Buffett 's timing was n't perfect -- the S&P 500 fell a bit more over the next few months .
But his long - term prediction was spot-on .
During the 1980s , the S&P 500 rose 13 % annually before dividends .
1999 : The Internet bubble
In November 1999 , during the height of the Internet bubble , Buffett made his only bearish call .
At the time , the market was in a speculative fervor , with Internet stocks showing huge price increases seemingly every day .
In the five years between 1995 and 1999 , the S&P 500 tripled , with compound annual returns of 26 % .
Many considered Buffett a relic for refusing to buy into the technology boom .
Buffett , however , noted that , because of a combination of cheap initial valuations and falling interest rates , stocks had achieved unprecedented annual returns of 19 % over a 17 - year period .
These results made investors unreasonably optimistic .
New investors were expecting 10 - year annual returns of 22.6 % , while even experienced investors predicted 12.9 % .
But the huge boom was only supported by modest GDP growth , and therefore was n't sustainable .
So , Buffett expected about 4 % real returns .
He continued to hold Coca - Cola ( NYSE: KO ) , Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) , and M&T Bank ( NYSE : MTB ) , though he noted in the 2004 annual report that he should have sold some of Berkshire Hathaway 's overvalued holdings .
Buffett 's bearish prediction proved optimistic .
The market continued to rise for a few months , with the S&P 500 topping out 9 % above where it was when Buffett made the call .
But that was followed by a crash .
Since his call , the S&P 500 has dropped by 39 % , for average annual losses of about 5 % , well below Buffett 's estimates .
The Foolish bottom line
The common theme of all these predictions is that Buffett did n't care about short - term fears .
He was n't worried about stagflation in the 1970s , and he did n't buy into the unrealistic optimism of the late 1990s .
Instead , he rationally valued stocks , and made the right long - term calls .
His biggest mistake was the 4 % number he threw out in 1999 -- long - term returns have been much worse than his bearish prediction .
But that prediction was too optimistic partly because stocks are so unreasonably cheap right now .
And that 's why Buffett 's buying today .
If you 're a short - term speculator , now is a bad time to gamble .
But if you 're truly in it for the long term , Warren Buffett has made the call .
He thinks stocks are cheap .
And we agree with him .

The police have been investigating leaks from the Home Office
The offices , home and car of Tory MP Damian Green have been swept for listening devices by a private security firm called in by his own party .
The Tories feared police investigating alleged leaks of sensitive Home Office material may have planted bugs when they raided the premises last week .
Despite intensive searches , nothing was found by the security experts .
The MP was held by police last week on suspicion of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office .
It is understood a Berkshire - based security firm was hired to carry out the search .
To avoid the possibility of any listening devices being planted we decided to have the offices in Bethersden swept .
Damian Green 's agent The Metropolitan police , whose officers arrested Mr Green last week , has declined to comment on the search .
Using electronic devices , the experts swept Mr Green 's constituency home and association offices in Bethersden , Kent , on Friday .
The day before , a similar sweep had been carried out at the MP's London residence , Westminster office , and his previously impounded car .
Mr Green 's agent Gordon Williams said : " Damian is very anxious to maintain the confidentiality of his electors ' parliamentary case work .
" Clearly the offices in Bethersden were occupied for quite some time without us personally being present .
" We cannot guarantee the integrity of the office while we 're not here , so to avoid the possibility of any listening devices being planted we decided to have the offices in Bethersden swept and also the parliamentary office , car and London and constituency homes . "
Alleged leaks Mr Williams confirmed no bugging devices were found in any of the searches .
Mr Green , the Conservative immigration spokesman , was arrested on 27 November over alleged leaks of sensitive Home Office material .
His controversial detention followed the 19 November arrest and then suspension of a 26 - year - old junior official .
Mr Green has always insisted that he had been doing his public duty in holding the Government to account and would continue to do so .

Muted sales of PS3 exclusives in US NPD data shows low sales for LBP , Resistance 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4
Matt Martin Wednesday 21st January 2009
Share this article Share
While sales figures of single platform titles for Nintendo and Microsoft prove there 's room for exclusive games on their respective home consoles , three of the biggest single format releases for Sony 's PS3 show poor sales in the US .
NPD data reported by Gamasutra shows that Media Molecule 's LittleBigPlanet only sold 611,000 copies in 2008 , since it was first released in late October .
By contrast , Microsoft 's Xbox 360 exclusive Gears of War 2 , released almost two weeks after LittleBigPlanet in the region , sold 2.31 million copies by year end .
North American sales of Insomniac 's Resistance 2 reached 385,000 units in November , but dropped off 45 per cent during December to 213,000 copies , to bring full - year sales to 598,000 .
Konami's Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots sold 775,000 copies in its first month of sale in the US , but after the June launch has managed to sell an average of 50,000 units per month to bring full year sales to 1.076 million units , although this figure does not include software included with the official console bundle .
The numbers also make grim reading for third party publishers , even with properties attached to more than one console .
Eidos ' recent admission that the latest Tomb Raider game had not met expectations resulted in lay - offs and a drop in share value .
NPD data shows that Tomb Raider : Underworld sold only 246,000 copies in the US in 2008 , across all three home consoles .
Ubisoft 's Prince of Persia has fared better .
The game was only released in December in a bid to avoid the new release crunch that so often affects sales in October and November , and NPD numbers reveal the game sold 483,000 copies in 2008 .
However , last year 's Assassin 's Creed managed to sell 1.87 million units in 2007 although it was released earlier in the year on November 14 .

OTTAWA - To save his job and his government , Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to suspend Parliament this week while his party blitzes the country with a public - relations campaign aimed at discrediting the notion of a Liberal - led coalition government propped up by the separatist Bloc Quebecois .
The Conservative party began airing radio ads Tuesday while ministers and other Tory representatives were appearing on as many all - news television channels and talk - radio programs as they could to push their party 's message that they will not , in the words of one of Harper 's senior advisers , " allow a new radical government without the people 's consent . "
The key attack line from the Tories is that the Liberals are betraying their federalist principles by agreeing to demands from the Bloc Quebecois .
" This deal that the leader of the Liberal party has made with the separatists is a betrayal of the voters of this country , a betrayal of the best interests of our economy , a betrayal of the best interests of our country , and we will fight it with every means we have , " Harper said in the House of Commons .
" The highest principle of Canadian democracy is that if one wants to be prime minister , one gets one 's mandate from the Canadian people , and not from Quebec separatists . "
But NDP Leader Jack Layton shot back that Harper himself was prepared to align himself with Gilles Duceppe and the Bloc Quebecois in 2004 when he was the opposition leader trying to bring down the government of Paul Martin .
" I did n't hear any of this high and mighty language and moral indignation from the prime minister when he signed a document along with myself and ( Bloc Leader Gilles )
Duceppe a few years ago , " Layton said .
The Liberals challenged Harper to call a confidence vote .
" Every member of the House has received a mandate from the Canadian people to deliver a government that will face the economic crisis .
The prime minister has failed .
The prime minister does not have the support of the House anymore , " Liberal Leader Stephane Dion said .
" Will he allow a vote to test if he has really the confidence of the House , as it must be in a parliamentary democracy ? "
Dion and Harper engaged in a heated , even explosive , exchange .
At one point , Harper accused Dion of removing the Canadian flags from the room before signing the deal with Layton and Duceppe .
News organizations , including Canwest News Service , took several photographs that clearly showed there were two Canadian flags , as well as the flags from all the provinces , directly behind the leaders as they read their statements - along with a third separate Canadian flag behind the table where they signed the agreement .
Harper 's defiant demeanour in the House on Tuesday was in marked contrast to the previous day , when he and many other Conservative MPs seemed resigned to losing power .
But sources in the Prime Minister 's Office say he regained his fight while watching the signing Monday of the tri-partite accord .
They say Harper was particularly incensed at Layton 's comments at the news conference that followed , during which he called on Harper to accept his fate with dignity and accept his new role as leader of the opposition .
According to those close to the prime minister , Harper said he felt Layton and the other leaders failed to show him any respect .
During question period Tuesday , the Conservatives leaped to their feet on several occasions to give the prime minister standing ovations .
Insults flew from both sides of the Commons , with the Tories labelling Dion a " traitor " and the Liberals shouting at Harper , " You are not the president . "
After question period , the Conservatives showered the prime minister with chants of " Harper ! Harper ! " in the government lobby before breaking out into the national anthem .
The bare - knuckles politicking followed the unveiling Monday of the historic accord between the Liberals and the NDP to unseat Harper 's minority government and replace it with a coalition supported by the Bloc Quebecois .
The new coalition government would be led by Dion until May 2 , his previously announced resignation date , when the new leader of the Liberal party would take over as prime minister .
Layton and five of his NDP MPs would get seats in the 24 - person coalition cabinet .
But several Liberal MPs , asking for anonymity , said while the deal had the unanimous support of caucus , it was the best of a bad set of choices facing their party , and they privately hoped another way out of this political showdown might be found .
A former Saskatchewan premier who took part in the talks that formed the coalition said all three parties knew the situation might not appear good .
" The atmosphere was cordial , but all three parties were conscious of the fact this whole operation was open to misrepresentation , " said former NDP premier Allan Blakeney , 83 , who was tapped by Layton to take part in the coalition talks in Ottawa over the weekend .
" Ourselves , but I think the Liberals even more so , indicated some level of apprehension about dealing with the Bloc , " said Blakeney , who said the Bloc also had trepidation about dealing with " two Anglo parties . "
For Harper , it 's the fight of his political career .
Many in his caucus are already grumbling that he 's responsible for goading the opposition with unnecessary and incendiary initiatives in last week 's economic and fiscal statement .
In that document , the government proposed eliminating taxpayer subsidies for political parties and rolling back wages for public - sector unions while taking away their right to strike .
Both those measures were hastily withdrawn over the weekend , but not before they had galvanized the opposition to begin the talks that would eventually lead to the coalition accord .
The Conservative party also launched a new website at canadians4democracy.ca and was trying to organize various anti-coalition rallies across the country .
Conservative activists are also being encouraged to call Liberal and NDP MPs to convince them to reconsider .
Meanwhile , Gov. Gen Michaelle Jean , who will play a key role in breaking the parliamentary logjam , is cutting short a state visit to Europe to return to Canada on Wednesday .
The government has the authority to suspend Parliament indefinitely , a process known as " proroguing . "
However , the prime minister must ask the Governor General for approval before doing so .
Typically , the Governor General grants the request as a matter of course at the end of a long Parliament , but Jean will be facing unprecedented circumstances , namely , the prospect of a government trying to suspend Parliament in the face of certain defeat .
If Parliament is prorogued , it would most likely reconvene just before the Conservatives table a budget on Jan. 27 , giving the Tories nearly two months to conduct their anti-coalition campaign .
Many Liberal and NDP MPs said Tuesday they fully expect Harper to prorogue .
Conservative officials were non-committal when asked , saying only the prime minister would use " any legal means necessary " to secure his position .
Harper is expected to make a televised address if and when he decides to prorogue .
Prorogation could happen as early as Wednesday , although Liberals and Conservatives are betting Harper will wait until the end of the week while his party 's public - relations campaign builds some steam .
If Harper does seek a prorogation , and if the Governor General refuses his request , the government would face its first , and likely last , confidence vote in the House of Commons on Monday .
Although Jean could choose to call a new general election , should the government lose a confidence motion , constitutional experts and many Conservatives themselves believe that , given how little time has elapsed since the Oct. 14 general election , she would simply invite Dion to form a government and become the country 's 23rd prime minister .
Jean said in a TV interview in Prague that she has received the letter Dion sent Monday on behalf of the coalition that has formed to replace the Conservatives .
" I received his letter , and the message in the letter is clear , " Jean said .
" I think that my presence is required in the country , so I will be leaving tomorrow . "
Asked what she would do if Harper asks for a prorogation , Jean replied that her door is open when she returns .
" Before I can answer this question , I have to see what the prime minister has to say to me , and what he is actually thinking of doing .
I do n't know exactly anything about his intentions yet . "
In another development , former Parti Quebecois leader Jacques Parizeau is reportedly going to publish an op - ed piece in French papers in Quebec in support of the coalition .
His support might turn up the heat on the Liberals and NDP in the rest of the country to defend their idea .

As Palestinians yesterday counted the human cost of the conflict , Israel was again accused of war crimes for using white phosphorus munitions .
" Such extensive use of this weapon in Gaza 's densely populated residential neighbourhoods is inherently indiscriminate , " said Donatella Rovera , a researcher with Amnesty International .
" Its repeated use in this manner , despite evidence of its indiscriminate effects and its toll on civilians , is a war crime . "
The UN and Human Rights Watch have made similar claims about the use of white phosphorus in the three - week conflict .
Amnesty sent a British weapons expert , Chris Cobb - Smith , into Gaza following the ceasefire at the weekend .
He found widespread evidence of the use of the incendiary material .
" We saw streets and alleyways littered with evidence of the use of white phosphorus , including still - burning wedges and the remnants of the shells and canisters fired by the Israeli army , " he said in a statement yesterday .
" White phosphorus is a weapon intended to provide a smokescreen for troop movements on the battlefield .
It is highly incendiary , air burst and its spread effect is such that it should never be used on civilian areas . "
Saudi Arabia yesterday pledged a donation of $ 1bn ( £ 691 m ) to help rebuild the Gaza Strip at an Arab summit in Kuwait , where divisions over the Israeli offensive flared publicly again .
Speaking in Kuwait , King Abdullah , leading the conservative , pro-western camp in the region , faced his rival , the Syrian president Bashar al - Assad , to appeal for unity .
The king also warned that a 2002 peace initiative offering Israel the recognition of all Arab states would not stay on the table for ever .
But Assad , a leading supporter of Hamas , demanded Israel be branded " a terrorist state " for its assault on Gaza and urged Arabs to " declare unequivocal support for the Palestinian resistance " .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Ask most Americans whether they 're in favor of spending taxpayer dollars to help delinquent mortgage borrowers and you 're likely to get an emphatic " No ! "
But the government did n't ask its citizens before it committed hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to guarantee loans through various foreclosure prevention initiatives such as FHASecure and Hope for Homeowners , which let troubled borrowers refinance expensive mortgages into more affordable loans .
Nor did it take a vote before it agreed to fund the new streamlined mortgage modification programs for loans backed by Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) .
And now there is the possibility that some of the hundreds of billions of dollars allocated for the Treasury 's Troubled Assets Relief Program will go towards bailing out borrowers .
Taxpayers are mad - especially those who held off buying their own homes or were careful not to spend beyond their means .
" All these idiots who bought homes they could n't really afford are going to be rewarded with loan modifications , but what about those of us who did n't make stupid decisions ? " asked Jay Black , a CNNMoney.com reader who rents in Queens , N.Y .
" I could have purchased two years ago using an option ARM , and now the government would be paying to reduce my balance .
But I did n't .
What the hell do I get ? "
Alice English , of Highland Falls in upstate New York , feels the same way .
" I made $ 45,000 a year and I did n't buy a house .
I bought a mobile home because I knew I could afford it , " she said .
But then she took a buy - out from her job as a technical specialist for a nuclear power plant , and her finances deteriorated , putting her home in jeopardy .
She may lose it .
And there 's little any lender will do for borrowers without income .
" My severance package has ended , " said English , " my credit rating is going down the tubes and we are going to bail out big companies and idiots who took an ARM who knew they could n't make those payments .
And here I sit , no job , no help , but billions are going to help those who created this problem . "
The case for bailing out homeowners is that foreclosures have far - reaching effects .
As delinquencies have skyrocketed , most of the country has suffered steep home - price declines which has helped cripple the economy .
Helping some homeowners but not others may not be fair , but it 's necessary to keep the economy from deteriorating even further .
" There 's always the issue - ' I 'm paying my mortgage even though I 'm upside down and my neighbor is not , ' " said Mark Goldman , a real estate professor at San Diego State University .
Letting delinquent mortgage borrowers slide into foreclosure will only do more damage to the entire financial system , according to Goldman .
That 's the most fundamental reason to support government funded rescue efforts .
" The appropriate public rationale [ for the bailouts ] is to support housing prices , " he said .
" The reason they 're doing this is to stop plummeting prices and everyone benefits from that . "
Different choices
Still , it 's easy to understand how some people can feel taken advantage of .
Consider the hypothetical case of one warehouse manager named John and his colleague Mary .
The two make about the same salary and are both married with two young kids and stay - at - home spouses .
A few years ago both bought homes , John 's a modest three bedroom , two bath .
He put 20 % down and financed $ 240,000 with a 30 - year , fixed - rate loan at 7 % .
His payment is $ 1,596 a month .
Mary went for an opulent five bedroom , four bath , 3,500 square foot McMansion that cost $ 500,000 .
She put just 5 % down and financed the rest with an option ARM , making the minimum monthly payments of just $ 1,725 .
But that caused her mortgage balance to balloon , and now Mary has to start paying down her loan 's principal , which has reached $ 550,000 .
That means a monthly mortgage payment of $ 3,659 , which she can't afford .
Luckily for Mary , her lender has reduced her interest rate to 3 % for five years , deferred payment on $ 50,000 of the balance and extended the length of the loan to 40 years , all with the help of one of the new , government - backed rescue programs .
That reduced her monthly mortgage bill to $ 1,790 - not much more than what John is paying for his more modest home .
Mary is essentially able to hang on to her palatial home with the help of some of John 's tax dollars - and as important as that is for the larger economy , it 's hard to argue that it 's fair .
Help too late
Other taxpayers are angry simply because the help that 's now available did n't come in time for them .
Tony Galindo bought a home in Ridgecrest Calif. for $ 283,000 in 2005 .
The one - time career Navy man put $ 60,000 down and financed the rest with monthly payments of $ 1,500 .
His current job with NavAir , which develops weapons systems , pays $ 6,200 a month , more than enough to afford a nice home .
But due to a divorce and some debts incurred by his ex-wife , he lost his house this past June , and can't buy another any time soon .
" My opinion is that it 's great that the government is going to help people in trouble , " he said , " but where 's my help ?
I 'm eager to purchase a new home but due to the foreclosure on my record that seems years away .
I can afford another home , but the foreclosure has closed the door on that . "
Others question why so much of the available foreclosure prevention help targets only severely delinquent borrowers who are at least two or three payments behind .
" Why does a homeowner have to be behind in their mortgage to qualify ? " asked Tamila Fiola of Fall River Mass .
" Why can't help be brought to those that are struggling to keep the note current ?
My sister in law pays over $ 5,000 a month for her mortgage ; she struggles to make it but she does . "
It 's probably impossible for the government to answer those kinds of questions to the satisfaction of all Americans .
And yet , the financial turmoil brought on by the mortgage meltdown will likely demand that the government make even more efforts to stabilize markets .
As they say , life just is n't fair .

Not surprisingly , the Mexican government is exploiting the bloody turf war between drug cartels to foist draconian laws on the Mexican people .
It should be noted that the drug cartel business in Mexico is highly profitable for the banksters who engage in wholesale money laundering .
In the late 1990s , several Mexican banks were charged with money laundering drug profits , including Banca Confia , owned by Citibank .
It is also a demonstrated fact that the CIA has been involved in the Latin America drug trade for decades ( see The CIA Drug Connection Is as Old as the Agency ) .
MEXICO CITY ( AP ) — Mexico ’s Congress on Tuesday voted to broaden police powers , allowing law enforcement agencies to use undercover agents and taped conversations as evidence in a bid to help them fight increasingly bloody drug cartels .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The reforms , which were approved earlier by the Senate , are backed by President Felipe Calderon and come as Mexico is shaken by organized - crime violence that has claimed almost 5,400 lives so far this year , more than double the death toll from the same period of 2007 .
They allow taped conversations to be used in court if submitted as evidence by one of the parties in the conversation , and let police request search warrants by e-mail or by telephone calls to judges rather than exclusively in writing , according to a Congressional statement .
The changes also permit undercover agents .
Many Mexican detectives currently operate in plain clothes , but the new measure would let them keep their identities secret in legal proceedings and be identified by a numerical code known only to superiors .
Drug gangs have increasingly targeted police officials for assassination in recent years .
The reforms include some safeguards meant to prevent police from abusing their powers , including one requiring that officers quickly register all detentions .
Under current law , they have up to two days to present a suspect before a judge .

INDEPENDENT , UK -
In selected watering holes across America , it 's party time tonight .
In Washington , the festivities will centER on the venerable City Tavern in Georgetown ; for $ 90 , you can taste the cocktail offerings of the capital 's most expert bartenders ( or " mixologists " as they like to term themselves ) , listen to a jazz band and , in the words of the invitation , " party like it 's 1933 " .
In San Francisco , after a parade through the streets , celebrants will make their way to the 21st Amendment Brewery , gaining entrance to the revelries within by use of a special password .
Similar events are being held in New York , Chicago , New Orleans and other US cities associated with an understanding acceptance of human frailty and having a good time .
By now the reason for these goings - on will be plain .
Tonight is the 75th anniversary of the end of Prohibition - of 5 December 1933 when Utah became the deciding 36th state to ratify the 21st amendment to the constitution , and restore to the country 's citizens the basic human right to go out and have a drink .
Rarely in the annals of human experience has so well intentioned an idea been such a monument to failure as America 's 13 - year attempt to eradicate the evil of alcohol .
The National Prohibition ( or Volstead )
Act was passed by Congress in October 1919 , overriding the veto of President Woodrow Wilson .
The following January , the Act was ratified as the 18th amendment of the constitution after it had been approved by the required three - quarters majority of US states .
The " noble experiment " , as its supporters termed it , did indeed lead to a modest decline in alcohol consumption and an overall improvement in public health .
But those meager and transient advantages were nothing compared to the unintended side - effects of Prohibition : a drastic decline in federal and state revenues , a surge in clandestine binge drinking and of course speak - easies , bootlegging , moonlighting and mobsters , not to mention the criminalization of millions of US citizens , including some its most eminent politicians , who were technically flouting the law of the land .
Ethan A. Nadelmann , Wall Street Journal -
We should consider why our forebears rejoiced at the relegalization of a powerful drug long associated with bountiful pleasure and pain , and consider too the lessons for our time .
The Americans who voted in 1933 to repeal prohibition differed greatly in their reasons for overturning the system .
But almost all agreed that the evils of failed suppression far outweighed the evils of alcohol consumption .
The change from just 15 years earlier , when most Americans saw alcohol as the root of the problem and voted to ban it , was dramatic .
Prohibition 's failure to create an Alcohol Free Society sank in quickly .
Booze flowed as readily as before , but now it was illicit , filling criminal coffers at taxpayer expense .
. .
When repeal came , it was not just with the support of those with a taste for alcohol , but also those who disliked and even hated it but could no longer ignore the dreadful consequences of a failed prohibition .
They saw what most Americans still fail to see today :
That a failed drug prohibition can cause greater harm than the drug it was intended to banish .
Consider the consequences of drug prohibition today : 500,000 people incarcerated in U.S. prisons and jails for nonviolent drug - law violations ; 1.8 million drug arrests last year ; tens of billions of taxpayer dollars expended annually to fund a drug war that 76 % of Americans say has failed ; millions now marked for life as former drug felons ; many thousands dying each year from drug overdoses that have more to do with prohibitionist policies than the drugs themselves , and tens of thousands more needlessly infected with AIDS and Hepatitis C because those same policies undermine and block responsible public - health policies .
And look abroad .
At Afghanistan , where a third or more of the national economy is both beneficiary and victim of the failed global drug prohibition regime .
At Mexico , which makes Chicago under Al Capone look like a day in the park .
And elsewhere in Latin America , where prohibition - related crime , violence and corruption undermine civil authority and public safety , and mindless drug eradication campaigns wreak environmental havoc .
All this , and much more , are the consequences not of drugs per se but of prohibitionist policies that have failed for too long and that can never succeed in an open society , given the lessons of history .
Perhaps a totalitarian American could do better , but at what cost to our most fundamental values ?
Why did our forebears wise up so quickly while Americans today still struggle with sorting out the consequences of drug misuse from those of drug prohibition ?
It 's not because alcohol is any less dangerous than the drugs that are banned today .
Marijuana , by comparison , is relatively harmless : little association with violent behavior , no chance of dying from an overdose , and not nearly as dangerous as alcohol if one misuses it or becomes addicted .
Most of heroin 's dangers are more a consequence of its prohibition than the drug 's distinctive properties .
That 's why 70 % of Swiss voters approved a referendum this past weekend endorsing the government 's provision of pharmaceutical heroin to addicts who could not quit their addictions by other means .
It is also why a growing number of other countries , including Canada , are doing likewise .
Last week over 200 people held a march and rally in the city of Barrancabermeja , Santander department , to demand justice for two imprisoned leaders of the largest campesino association in the region a day before the beginning of their trial .
Last week over 200 people held a march and rally in the city of Barrancabermeja , Santander department , to demand justice for two imprisoned leaders of the largest campesino association in the region a day before the beginning of their trial .
Andrés Elías Gil and Miguel Gonzáles Huepa went before a judge for the first time since their 2007 arrests , for their leadership of the Campesino Campesino Association of the Cimitarry River Valley ( ACVC ) .
Activists from a dozen groups held up banners and placards pledging solidarity , as over a hundred campesino members chanted demanding their release , and sang songs of resistance .
They also demanded an end to fumigations , which recently pulverized fields of yucca , banana and plantain outside Puerto Matilde in Antioquia department , and called for continuation of coca eradication by hand instead .
They were joined by representatives of student unions , women ’s groups , human rights defenders CREDHOS and ASORVIM and local oil workers unions SINALTRAINAL and the USO .
The case has also generated international attention ; dozens of UK trade union and parliament leaders sent letters to the Colombian president and local judges last year demanding freedom for both men .
In advance of the hearing , other political prisoners held in Tier No. 8 at the Palogordo prison in Girón , Santander declared themselves on hunger strike .
In a communique they also denounced the " grave human rights crisis " facing prisoners there .
Both activists were captured by state security agents and soldiers in January and September 2007 , both times while taking part in community meetings .
Four other leaders were also taken into custody during the raids and were released in 2007 for lack of evidence .
Orders of capture have been issued for eighteen ACVC leaders total .
Fearing the impossibility of a just hearing in this climate , six have gone into exile .
" This is a political process , not a judicial process , " clarified one of the group ’s leaders in a press conference .
" No one is running because they ’re guilty .
ACVC members are being sought because they threaten the political priorities of the government . "
The notorious Calibío Batallion of the army ’s 7th Division carried out the arrests , during which they briefly , mistakenly detained Miguel ’s son , whose ID card also read " Miguel Gonzáles . "
A week later , the same batallion killed the younger Miguel and dressed him in the camouflage of a guerrilla fighter .
Members of the army unit have been fingered as the culprits of dozens of similar so - called " false positive " extrajudicial executions , the most of the military units operating in the valley .
The persecutions are nothing new for campesinos in the region .
In northeastern Antioquia department alone eleven campesinos have been killed during the Uribe administration , and in twelve years of existence six ACVC leaders have been assasinated , with dozens of the group ’s members also been assassinated by military and paramilitary forces .
In addition to arbitrary prosecution the ACVC has been menaced as of late by new paramilitary organizations , including the Gaitanista Self - Defense Forces of Colombia , who also sent threats to Barrancabermeja groups like the oilworkers union ( USO ) last October .
Persecuted for Success
The ACVC might be the most successful campesino organization in the country , counting tens of thousands of members in the sprawling Magdaleno Medio region , comprising parts of the Bolívar , Antioquia , Santander and Cesar departments .
Through productive projects like a buffalo herd incubation program — in which families are loaned eleven buffalo for three years to start their own herd — and organizational development programs to create more opportunities for women , the ACVC are unique in their dedication to economic initiatives that allow campesinos to be less reliant on coca production , which is otherwise the only viable , marketable crop for small farmers .
These programs have all been implemented unilaterally by the group since the founding of the Campesino Reserve Zone of the Cimitarra River Valley ( ZRC ) , a legal determination that would prevent the further growth of large plantations and resource extraction projects in the area , allowing projects that benefited campesinos and the environment to flourish .
The ZRC was first proposed in 1998 , to cover Cantagallo , Remedios , San Pablo and Yondó municipalities , and guarantee land tenancy for campesinos .
As the ACVC explained in a founding document , " We hope to create a model form of local development based in a just , regional redistribution of resources , avoiding land expropriation and forced displacement . "
The ACVC itself was formed in 1996 thanks to unfulfillment of promises made by the federal government to communities in Magdalena Medio in response to massive street marches in that year .
The group started with 56 Communal Action Committees ( JAC ) made up largely of campesinos displaced by landowners and paramilitaries .
Today the association counts 120 JACs , productive cooperative projects raising cattle , buffalo and fish , women ’s programs , community health projects , human rights committees and a technical support committee staffed by volunteers from urban areas .
Their work to support organizational development and political education seeks to make possible the redistribution of land and dignity for campesinos in the short term , and longer term to ensure structural changes to improve the conditions of people in the regions .
The zone was made possible by Law 160 of 1994 governing the National Agrarian Reform System .
Chapter XIII refers to the ZRC as a way of establishing campesino economies and impeding the growth of big plantations .
This chapter was amplified in 1996 by Decree 1777 , following pressure from campesinos and cocaleros around the country beginning to develop the structure of proposed ZRCs .
Along with the Cimitarran River Valley , ZRCs were also incubated at this time in the regions of Pato - Balsillas ( Caquetá department ) , Calamar ( Guaviaré ) and Cabrera ( Cundinamarca ) , each under the sponsorship of local campesino groups .
The zone is considered especially important for the well - being of campesinos and the environment as a whole in Magdalena Medio , where pressure by multinationals to exploit resources in the region have gradually intensified over seventy years .
The area is home to some of the largest oil wells in Colombia – first drilled by Standard Oil in the 1930s – which account for 70 % of economic activity .
The region , named for the Magdalena River , also counts a large trade in coal , lumber , palm oil , and gold , monopolized for the most part by large industrialists .
Also significant is commercial production of beef , rice , cotton , corn and cacao , which is dominated by large landowners who have historically pushed campesinos further to the edges to expand their own plantations .
Following the signing of an agreement with President Andrés Pastrana in 2000 , the ACVC had within two years fulfilled all requirements stipulated by the state agency Incoder , and on December 10 , 2002 Resolution 028 declared the zone a legal entity , covering 184,000 hectares in two departments with over 25,000 inhabitants .
Within three months , following pressure by " landowners , paramilitaries and narcotraffickers , " according to the ACVC , president Álvaro Uribe Vélez had suspended all ZRCs .
At the time the Cimitarra River Valley ZRC was in fact acting to limit the growth of plantations , agroindustry and large - scale mineral exploitation .
The president , however , claimed that the ZRC was generating social conflict .
Four years later , in the face of new protests demanding compliance with the law , the viceminister of agriculture claimed that " lifting the ban will deepen the crisis of violence . "
Last week ACVC members pointed to pending development projects that threaten their way of life as reasons for the continued urgency of the ZRC .
These include a hydroelectric project in Yondó on the Tamar River , and the presence of a contractor of state oil company Ecopetrol undertaking seismic exploration for petroleum deposits , during which the only riverway to the Magdalena River was blocked , making inaccessible the only form of transportation in the winter months when rains make road travel impossible .
The area is also an important supplier of hardwoods , a trade dominated by large landlords but with participation also by campesinos .
As part of their commitment to environmental sustainability , the ACVC has sought certification from forest management certifier SmartWood for its affiliate villages , to ensure that forest management practices comply with Forest Stewardship Council guidelines .
This is critical because over 90 % of all timber is harvested illicitly , and 80 % is lost before arriving to port in Barrancabermeja .
One of the group ’s slogans is , " Para que no haya más tierras sin hombres y hombres sin tierras , " – ( " So that there will be no more land without men and men without land " ) a reference to large plantations owned by big landowners that often sit fallow , as displaced campesinos struggle to get by .
Much like the Zapatistas decided to ignore the Mexican government ’s unwillingness to follow through with agreements , and have since 2003 unilaterally implemented the San Andrés Accords giving indigenous people regional autonomy across western Chiapas on the border with Guatemala , the ACVC has pressed on with projects designed to improve the standing of campesinos in the region , constantly under attack by multinational industrial initiatives and the local consolidation of land holdings .
Since the suspension in 2003 the group has received funding for its work from the United Nations and European Union , and has sought alliances with national and international allies to reinstate the ZRC .
A Very Focused ‘ Investigation ’
ACVC Community Health Center
The two ACVC leaders are being accused of rebellion , a crime under Article 467 of the penal code , and specifically of being FARC rebels .
In a rare move , the Attorney General asked the AG ’s special Medellín Human Rights Unit to prosecute the case .
Under Colombian law , the prosecution has only six months to conduct investigations , and six months to convince a judge to convict .
The investigations have lasted over six years , and in Miguel ’s case should have expired in December , automatically liberating him .
But the judge lifted this restriction .
On Wednesday the judges heard from witnesses in each case , all claiming to be " reinserted " former FARC combatants , and all currently on the payroll of the state .
In Colombia , it ’s not necessary to present empirical evidence to secure a conviction , testimony of paid informants is enough .
One witness claimed he could n’t remember when or where he ’d seen Andres meet with rebels , and another claimed to have seen him with two " blonde , Swiss agents " bringing the FARC millions of dollars .
But , once again , could n’t remember when or where .
Informants who turn themselves in have in other cases been discovered to be either disgruntled political rivals or simply campesinos looking for a government handout .
Leaders of unions in Arauca have been convicted based on similar accounts .
" The authorities were n’t looking for evidence here , they already knew who they wanted to go after , " said attorney Luis Alfonso Ruiz of the legal corporation Humanidad Vigente , of the prosecution ’s case .
" They tapped the phones of the ACVC office , of Miguel Cifuentes … this was a very focused ‘ investigation . ’ "
Miguel only has one witness for the prosecution accusing him of FARC membership , following the renouncement of another state witness , ACVC secretary Álvaro Manzano , who was imprisoned , interrogated and forced to sign an " exit agreement " that , it was later revealed , was written as a confession .
Call for Support
Since they were transferred to the maximum security prison in Palogordo from a jail in Bucaramanga , the two have suffered random attacks of pepper spray and tear gas by guards , and punishment for violations of prison rules committed by cellmates , which include being forced to disrobe and being beaten when they decline .
They are housed in a tier with others accused of rebellion , paramilitarism , and common theft – a clear safety risk to both well - known civilian leaders .
" It ’s too expensive to visit , " said Miguel ’s daughter , Marta Gonzalez , in an interview .
" He can call us occasionally , but it ’s far away . "
Each man faces at least another three or four hearings , set to resume in April , before judges announce a verdict .
Supporters are asked to write to the judge in the case denouncing the arbitrary prosecution of these two social movement leaders and demanding their release .

‘ Clickjacking ’ , if you have n’t heard of it , is a method used by malicious individuals to trick users like you into clicking something without you knowing what you ’ve clicked .
It ’s also known as UI - redressing and only works in browsers that support frames / CSS .
The idea is simple :
An iframe is positioned above what looks like a clickable button on a website .
This iframe is invisible to the user ( opacity : 0 ) and so the user unknowingly clicks on the iframe which may contain anything !
This can be achieved through CSS alone , no JavaScript is required .
A variation of this technique involves the use of JavaScript to move the iframe around the screen inline with the user ’s cursor , therefore achieving the same thing but without having to convince the user to click on a button .
Background info
I believe the original concern was related to Flash and how a user could unknowingly enable their webcam and microphone so the attacker would have access .
There are some other examples shown here : http://www.grc.com/sn/notes-168.htm.
Adobe resolved this issue in October of last year with a new release of Flash Player .
Obviously this only offers protection for that particular exploit – gaining access to webcam / microphone ; other more rudimentary techniques still work perfectly today .
The only solid form of protection I ’ve heard of ( other than disabling CSS ) is the NoScript addon for Firefox .
Even though clickjacking is fundamentally unrelated to JavaScript the team behind NoScript went the extra mile and developed a pretty cool way of detecting it ; a module named ‘ clearClick ‘ which will compare a screenshot of the currently viewed page against a screenshot of the same page but with frames at full opacity .
If you ’re not using Firefox you could try disabling iFrames ( if your browser lets you ) , or , alternatively , you could install a user - scripting plugin and get rid of all iframes via a script .
Here are some non-Firefox GreaseMonkey emulators :
IE : Trixie or GM4IE
Safari : Creammonkey
And here ’s a script you could use :
var all = document .
getElementsByTagName ( ' iframe ' ) , l = all .
length ; while ( l -- ) all [ l ] .
parentNode .
removeChild ( all [ l ] ) ;
Clickjacking Twitter
THIS NO LONGER WORKS ( as of ~ 6:45 PM , 12/Feb’09 ) , TWITTER HAS IMPLEMENTED A FRAME -BREAKING SCRIPT »
This is a good thing ! 🙂
Using the basic technique of positioning an iframe over a button coupled with Twitter ’s ‘ status ’ URL parameter I have created a small demo which shows you just how serious ( and annoying ) this could be !
It will only work if you ’re currently logged into Twitter ( and if you have n’t got any of the above measures in place ) :
Go to Twitter , make sure you ’re logged in .
Go to this page : qd9.co.uk/temp/ClickJackEg.html
Click the button .
Wait about two seconds
Go to your Twitter page ; look at your latest status !
What does this mean ?
It means anyone can update your Twitter status without you knowing !
Actually , it ’s YOU that ’s updating it , you just do n’t know at the time .
This is a pretty harmless example but I can imagine it being used for more sinister endeavours !
Clickjacking is a dangerous malicious technique ; take it seriously !
It can not be halted with a quick browser fix here and there because the problem lies within the CSS / frame implementation itself ; it ’s not a software bug !
If you ’re fortunate enough to use Firefox then install NoScript , otherwise explore the other measures I described above .
Thanks for reading !
Please share your thoughts with me on Twitter .
Have a great day !
Rising temperatures and the resulting drought are causing trees in the West to die at more than twice the pace they did a few decades ago , a new study has found .
The combination of temperature and drought has also reduced the ability of the forests to absorb carbon dioxide , which traps heat and thus contributes to global warming , the authors of the study said , and has made forests sparser and more susceptible to fires and pests .
The scientists , who analyzed tree census data collected in 1955 and in later years , found that the mortality of trees increased in 87 percent of the 76 forest plots studied .
In some plots , the die - off rate doubled in as little as 17 years ; in others , it doubled after 29 years , the study found .
“ Summers are getting longer , ” said Nathan L. Stephenson , of the United States Geological Survey , a leader of the study with Phillip van Mantgem , also of the geological survey .
“ Trees are under more drought stress . ”
Ok , do n't get me wrong -- I love Japanese girls dressed as characters from manga and anime , and the more boobs tumbling out of tops , the better ( at least , most of the time ) .
But seriously , you can be otaku to the millionth power and not come close to the awesome levels this guy is rocking .
Spotted at Lucca Comics & Games 2008 , he even thought to bring a stand to perfectly accessorize for photo opportunities such as the one you see above .
In case you 're wondering , he is n't glued down with a servant carrying him from place to place -- as you can see in one of the other shots , he also stands up for other pictures .
If he had done the street mime thing and stood perfectly posed for hours on end , he might have earned himself some sort of award , not to mention back and neck pain straight from hell .

Dick Cheney Suffers Atrial Fibrillation Again
canceled morning meetings in order to head directly to George Washington University Hospital to deal with a recurrence of an abnormal heart beat .
The condition , atrial fibrillation , is not new to the vice president .
Cheney has had several bouts of the upper heart chamber condition and will undergo an outpatient procedure called cardioversion to restore regular heart rhythm .
An electrical impulse shocks the heart back into beating normally .
His last episode was in November 2007 .
He has also suffered four heart attacks dating back to 1978 .
On a lighter note , this photo of Cheney was all the rage in April 2008 .

Elaine Meinel Supkis
I spent 8 hours with no breaks , observing the US House as it tried to deal with the complete collapse of the entire US banking system .
While debating the $ 700 Billion Bank Bail Out Bill , I was astounded at the lack of knowledge , the shallow discussions , the stone - walling , the wailing of Gollum Sachs complaining about not sleeping , but no discussion as to how Congress enabled and assisted in this collapse .
So here is a comprehensive article about just ONE aspect of this historic banking disaster : the death of the Glass - Steagall Act and how it enabled the banking lending bubble .
Time to examine the bill from Congress that helped to recreate the toxic trusts of the Roaring Twenties :
The bills were introduced in the Senate by Phil Gramm ( R - TX ) and in the House of Representatives by James Leach ( R - IA ) and Thomas Bliley ( R - VA ) .
The bills were passed by a 54 - 44 vote largely along party lines with Republican support in the Senate and by a 343 - 86 vote in the House of Representatives .
Nov 4 , 1999 : After passing both the Senate and House the bill was moved to a conference committee to work out the differences between the Senate and House versions .
Democrats agreed to support the bill only after Republicans agreed to strengthen provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act and address certain privacy concerns .
The final bipartisan bill resolving the differences was passed in the Senate and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 12 , 1999 .
The banking industry had been seeking the repeal of Glass - Steagall since at least the 1980s .
In 1987 the Congressional Research Service prepared a report which explored the case for preserving Glass - Steagall and the case against preserving the act .
Many of the largest banks , brokerages , and insurance companies desired the Act at the time .
The justification was that individuals usually put more money into investments when the economy is doing well , but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad .
With the new Act , they would be able to do both ' savings ' and ' investment ' at the same financial institution , which would be able to do well in both good and bad economic times .
The Gramm - Leach bill was a 100 % GOP affair .
Many commentators on the right would like to make this affair Bill Clinton 's responsibility .
The bipartisan nature of the vote for this bill definitely puts a lot of responsibility on both parties .
But the initiative for the impetus behind this and the bankruptcy bill lies within the GOP .
A number of Democrats desired this , too .
But nearly the entire GOP desperately wanted these bills .
For example , in the Senate , only one Democrat voted for the bill .
All Republicans but 2 voted for it .
Only one of the two did n't vote at all , the other voted ' Present . ' 79 % of the House voted because of the addition of provisions that would encourage these new - fangled financial institutions to lend to inner city neighborhoods .
The House alterations to this terrible bill gave the GOP a veto - proof majority .
Clinton , in turn , signed this .
Interestingly , all but 3 NY Representatives supported this bill .
Half of the Texas delegation voted against it .
The number of Republicans against the bill , in contrast to the Senate vote that was 100 % behind the Senate version , was due to anger over the inclusion of the easing of lending to inner cities .
A common thread in our history is the frowns over spending money on our inner cities !
More about that later .
To review this matter and look more closely at the machinery that destroyed US banking from top to bottom , we should look closely at this bill :
Gramm - Leach - Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act
TITLE I -- FACILITATING AFFILIATION AMONG BANKS , SECURITIES FIRMS , AND INSURANCE COMPANIES
Repeals the restrictions on banks affiliating with securities firms contained in sections 20 and 32 of the Glass - Steagall Act.
Creates a new " financial holding company " under section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act .
Such holding company can engage in a statutorily provided list of financial activities , including insurance and securities underwriting and agency activities , merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investment activities .
Activities that are " complementary " to financial activities also are authorized .
The nonfinancial activities of firms predominantly engaged in financial activities ( at least 85 % financial ) are grandfathered for at least 10 years , with a possibility for a five year extension .
The Federal Reserve may not permit a company to form a financial holding company if any of its insured depository institution subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed , or did not receive at least a satisfactory rating in their most recent CRA exam .
To join in this carnival , first the banks and investment houses had to be capitalized .
Citigroup already won permission to do this before the bill passed .
We know that during the following 10 years , Citigroup had to sell larger and larger pieces of its corporate self to OPEC lords and Asians in order to re-capitalize the floundering Citibank group .
Let 's look at the stock charts for Citigroup after it got permission to become this new , dangerous entity :
Even as the Dot Com collapse riled markets and stocks fell and fell , Citigroup shot upwards !
The magic of the creation of this new entity attracted investors a great deal especially overseas investors .
In just 2 years and this , during a huge downturn in stocks , the Citigroup stocks shot upwards from $ 15 a share to $ 55 a share !
This was $ 20 a year increase in value which meant it more than doubled in value every year .
In general , indeed the very definition of a bubble is , it more than doubles in size every year .
This is called ' unsustainable growth ' .
All growth in any system has to level off at some point or it overwhelms natural limits .
The only entity that can have eternity and infinity is the unimaginable place that surrounds our entire universe , the anti-universe which can contain infinite numbers of expanding universes .
I call this place , ' The Outer Darkness ' since astronomers can't see it and the Big Bang veils even the darkness itself from our eyes .
We can only see inside of our own bubble .
The fact that our universe is a big bubble troubles astronomers who think this universe bubble will collapse like all other , smaller bubbles .
It can't double in size forever , in other words .
We do n't know but usually , micro-natural forces are mirrored nearly perfectly by macro-natural forces .
After 9/11 , our entire economy went on the skids .
All of Wall Street was literally damaged or huge parts of it destroyed on that day .
The rest was nearly unusable for weeks .
The economy began to retract .
Greenspan had already been cutting interest rates quickly as Bush cut taxes so the economy could run again .
And it did !
ON THE WRONG TRACKS .
2003 , Citibank was on the ropes .
But then , the Saudis stepped in and bought a huge stake in it thanks to the flood of easy profits from soaring oil prices , post - 9/11 .
The US government was banging the drums for a war with Iraq .
The Greenspan 1 % interest rates were kicking in .
Citibank suddenly was ' capitalized ' by all this and the new , sub-inflationary rates were a god -send to that bank and they began writing both private and corporate loans at a tremendous pace .
The stocks shot up in value to the 2000 levels of $ 55 a share and this peaked on the end of February , 2007 .
This is when the first banking collapse shocks hit world markets .
From Culture of Life News , February 27 , 2007 : Chinese Communists Pull Rug Out From Under USA Capitalists
From Bellepheron on Pegasus to Icarus or the son of Helios , when one rides the wild horses to the very heavens themselves , the fall is great and obvious .
For several years , I have said repeatedly that a trillion dollars in FOREX funds would trigger the secret ( HAHAHAHA ) Chinese plan to upend the American empire via economic meltdown .
The ernest Chinese felt they should warn us so several months ago , as they approached that sum , they warned us to cut spending and start saving ... ALL OF US .
Not just any one person .
Having warned us , now comes the inevitable storm .
Just this morning , I warned everyone about the Chinese stock market fall after the commuist leaders tightened credit and warned banks to be careful with loans .
On a side note , today the Chinese stock exchange fell a great deal because they know the American markets are about to collapse because we can't use rising home values to pay for goodies from China .
The Chinese government does n't care if billionaires lose money .
They want people to put money in savings , not stocks .
Stocks are gambling .
But this drop in value reflects reality : the USA is going belly - up and wo n't be able to buy stuff much longer as the dollar drops in value and the USA continues insane spending programs that are entirely based on generous loans from Asia .
The Chinese assessment of the future is correct .
Our own leader 's rosy prognastigations are wrong .
And this is the real bomb that is set to go off right under our noses .
The silly American media has been lying to everyone about China : that the Chinese were foolish and stupid and did n't understand inflation or the idea of comparative value versus comparable trade or anything .
They were supposed to be naive and frankly , stupid .
From the same day : Economic Cartoons Up The Yin Yang
For several years , I have struggled to make cartoons and charts that lay out in no uncertain terms , what is going on with our economy .
They started out rather crude as I learned how to use the Wacom pad which is a very disassociative way of drawing , the picture shows up far from where the hand is drawing and the computer process is slightly delayed compared to the normal speed which one draws using analog tools like pencils and paper .
My third story that day : Classic Panic Attack Roiled World Markets
Xinhua
News even thoughtfully explains fully what happened yesterday .
Securities analysts said the culprit behind the " Black Tuesday " panic was a rumor that China is to levy capital gains tax on retail equity investors .
However , as the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation blew out the rumor , Chinese shares regained their momentum with the recovery of investors ' confidence .
HAHAHA .
So , Chinese officials launched this crash and then they gently told the investors in China who read Chinese newspapers , ' Just kidding . '
I must be the only person in blogland who noticed the Chinese communists are holding a big meeting this month to discuss our futures .
A great time to see what control they have over our lives .
Namely , it is total .
Arf .
The housing bubble popped one year before this event .
It was a hyper- magic number day and like 7/17/ 7 , is a key date in the unfolding of this collapse .
When this event roiled world markets , all the central bankers but China 's , began to play hysterical funny money games to keep the GROWTH momentum up .
When we look back at the Citigroup charts , we see clearly how there was a very sudden , steep decline which ended quickly .
Like a cork in water , it popped back up to $ 55 dollars a share .
But this was very temporary .
By mid-July , Citibank as well as all its fellow new - fangled fellow financial investment banks were all sliding off the exact same cliff and for the exact same reasons .
We can see from the charts who selling of these toxic stocks shot through the roof .
All bankrupt corporations have the exact same charts .
The sudden rise in the selling graphs along with a steep reverse - hockey stick value graph above !
Nearly never can a corporation survive this sort of shock .
They can be bailed out by governments but this is a faux wealth event .
Citibank has gone from 30 million shares in exchanges to over 300 million shares traded in less than two years .
Everyone is bailing .
The close - up chart showing this week makes it very clear that last week , it nearly totally collapsed .
The only support for this crummy , stupid bank was the Bank Bail Out Bill .
When the Democrats were scared into rushing through the bill on Monday , these stocks shot upwards tremendously .
And stayed at that level for three days .
By Tuesday , I was roaming the Halls of Congress , sniffing around and spreading warnings .
By Tuesday afternoon , the flood of calls from outraged American patriots killed the Paulson coup bill that would hijack US credit and hand the entire thing to the bankers with no reforms , not strings attached and no review by courts or anyone !
Citibank 's stocks began to flounder again .
But has risen slightly on the hopes that the Democrat 's amended bill will bail them out .
This is a very long article because it is vital that we understand perfectly well how Congress , the corrupt Presidents [ Clinton picked up $ 100 million for his services , for example ] have helped the banking gnomes create machines that were badly designed and had serious internal flaws that doomed them to create bubbles that would inevitably pop .
Back to the document , ' The Gramm - Leach - Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act ' :
If any insured depository institution or insured depository institution affiliate of a financial holding company received less than a satisfactory rating in its most recent CRA exam , the appropriate Federal banking agency may not approve any additional new activities or acquisitions under the authorities granted under the Act .
Provides that bank holding companies organized as a mutual holding companies will be regulated on terms comparable to other bank holding companies .
[ HAHAHA ]
Lifts some restrictions governing nonbank banks .
[ De-regulation , big time ! ]
Provides for a study of the use of subordinated debt to protect the financial system and deposit funds from " too big to fail " institutions and a study on the effect of financial modernization on the accessibility of small business and farm loans .
OK : This week , debate has been raging in DC concerning all this !
Washington Mutual was ' too big to fail ' so it was what ?
Broken up ?
Or did all the juicy parts get sucked up by JP Morgan ?
Of course !
Everyone is watching passively as JP Morgan sucks down all rivals !
So what is JP Morgan ?
A bubble !
And on top of that , trying desperately to reach ' Mega - too - big - to - fail ' status !
And the use of subordinated debt as protections ?
WOW .
In finance , subordinated debt ( also known as subordinated loan , subordinated bond , subordinated debenture or junior debt ) is debt which ranks after other debts should a company fall into receivership or be closed .
Such debt is referred to as subordinate , because the debt providers ( the lenders ) have subordinate status in relationship to the normal debt .
A typical example for this would be when a promoter of a company invests money in the form of debt , rather than in the form of stock .
In the case of liquidation the promoter would be paid just before stockholders -- assuming there are assets to distribute after all other liabilities and debt has been paid .
Subordinated debt has a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation during bankruptcy , below the liquidator , government tax authorities and senior debt holders in the hierarchy of creditors .
Because subordinated debt is repayable after other debts have been paid , they are more risky for the lender of the money .
It is unsecured and has lesser priority than that of an additional debt claim on the same asset .
Subordinated loans typically have a higher rate of return than senior debt due to the increased inherent risk .
Accordingly , major shareholders and parent companies are most likely to provide subordinated loans , as an outside party providing such a loan would normally want compensation for the extra risk .
Corporate issuers tend to prefer not to issue subordinated bonds because of the higher interest rate required to compensate for the higher risk , but may be forced to do so if indentures on earlier issues mandate their status as senior bonds .
Also , subordinated debt may be combined with preferred stock to create so called monthly income preferred stock , a hybrid security paying dividends for the lender and funded as interest expense by the issuer .
HAHAHA .
These newfangled banking entities made PROFITS selling the RISKS of subordinated lending !
As I pointed out in the past , the side effect of the free funny money regime of Greenspan was that people had to take greater and greater risks in order to beat mere inflation !
So bankers sought ' new instruments ' to sell that would carry much higher rates of return .
This is why a flood , a tsunami of lending to the most riskiest sectors of the real estate and commercial markets shot through the roof !
The world 's # 1 and # 3 economies wanted desperately to make easy money but could n't do this via simpler systems due to the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve both dropping interest rates to the cellar .
So homeowners in America who put 20 % down and qualified for the lowest lending rates were PURE POISON to these bankers but the 0 % down crew that had to get 9 % interest rate loans , etc , these SUB - PRIME borrowers were viewed as pure gold !
This is what happens when the Fed foolishly ignores real inflation .
People imagine , if they are good credit risks , they will be beloved by the bankers .
But in the upside - down world of sub-inflation rate lending , we get the exact opposite !
The BAD BORROWERS are valuable and the GOOD BORROWERS become pure poison .
But any banking system that depends on spendthrifts who go bankrupt for profits will end up where ours is : bankrupt .
Streamlines bank holding company supervision by clarifying the regulatory roles of the Federal Reserve as the umbrella holding company supervisor , and the State and other Federal financial regulators which ‘ functionally ' regulate various affiliates .
Prohibits FDIC assistance to affiliates and subsidiaries of banks and thrifts .
[ This was inserted by the Democrats in Congress ]
Allows a national bank to engage in new financial activities in a financial subsidiary , except for insurance underwriting , merchant banking , insurance company portfolio investments , real estate development and real estate investment , so long as the aggregate assets of all financial subsidiaries do not exceed 45 % of the parent bank 's assets or $ 50 billion , whichever is less .
To take advantage of the new activities through a financial subsidiary , the national bank must be well capitalized and well managed .
In addition , the top 100 banks are required to have an issue of outstanding subordinated debt .
Merchant banking activities may be approved as a permissible activity beginning 5 years after the date of enactment of the Act .
Provides for national treatment for foreign banks wanting to engage in the new financial activities authorized under the Act .
The negotiations going on this weekend concern this section of the banking reforms that utterly failed and ruined the entire US banking systems .
Namely , the FDIC has to assist everyone or the whole mess will turn into a Great Depression .
The hedges and assurances of this bill passed a mere 10 years ago are going out the window .
When this bill was passed , the national banks were NOT ' well capitalized and well managed ' at all .
Look at Citigroup 's stocks from just before they got the exemptions !
It was in the toilet .
The exemptions allowed it to balloon rapidly in value !
Also the pathetic timeline here : these laws were to take effect in 5 years !
That would mean , by 2004 .
Right when Greenspan was busy bailing out the woefully undercapitalized banks with his 1 % lending to them from the Federal Reserve !
TITLE VI -- FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM MODERNIZATION
A new , permanent capital structure for the Federal Home Loan Banks is established .
Two classes of stock are authorized , redeemable on 6 - months and 5 - years notice .
Federal Home Loan
Banks must meet a 5 % leverage minimum tied to total capital and a risk - based requirement tied to permanent capital Equalizes the stock purchase requirements for banks and thrifts .
Voluntary membership for Federal savings associations takes effect six months after enactment .
The US was moving rapidly towards the 0%- 0 % -0 % Japanese system .
Dropping the leverage minimum to just 5 % is very inflationary as well as creates bubbles while undercapitalizing the banks !
As China raised their own reserve rations relentlessly upwards , the US dropped our own ratios .
This is also a big part of our banking collapse .
The Federal Reserve 's position in world FOREX reserves fell dramatically in the last 20 years and especially in the last 7 years .
Our undercapitalization of our entire banking system from the lowliest thrift to the highest unthrifty levels , this is why our entire banking system is collapsing .
Congress , the Treasury and the Fed sparred and yakked for hours while I fumed .
Not once did any of them talk about any of this .
This article is required reading for all of them , especially Beranke .
He might even learn something from my economic cartoon collection I included here which I published on the magic number day that signified the beginning of the collapse of the banking lending bubble .

El Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos , a nombre de la Agencia de Protecci�n Ambiental , decidi� multar con 2 millones de d�lares a la cementera mexicana Cemex por violar el Acta de Aire Limpio en California .
El decreto se�ala que en 2007 la transnacional mexicana solt� al aire contaminantes como �xido de nitr�geno , di�xido de sulfuro y mon�xido de carbono , sin contar con los permisos correspondientes para esas emisiones .
Adem�s , se obliga a Cemex a fijar nuevos l�mites de emisiones de contaminantes en su planta de Victorville , una de las m�s grandes cementeras de Estados Unidos , que representar�an una reducci�n de casi 40 % en sus emisiones anuales .
De acuerdo con la Agencia de Protecci�n Ambiental de EU , el hecho de mantener estos nuevos rangos de emisiones podr�a costar varios millones de d�lares a la cementera , dependiendo de la tecnolog �a que use para cumplir esta meta .

Why are we asking this now ?
Communities Minister Hazel Blears made a speech to the Hansard Society yesterday in which she criticised political bloggers in the UK .
" Political blogs are written by people with disdain for the political system and politicians , who see their function as unearthing scandals , conspiracies and perceived hypocrisy , " she said .
Conservative grandee Lord Baker has described the comments as " extraordinary " .
He said : " She needs to tune into the modern world .
People have a right to say what they think and if she does n't like it she can blog back " .
However , Blears maintains that : " Until political blogging adds value to our political culture , by allowing new voices , ideas and legitimate protest and challenge , and until the mainstream media reports politics in a calmer , more responsible manner , it will continue to fuel a culture of cynicism and despair . "
But do n't politicians write blogs too ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yes , Cabinet Office Minister Tom Watson has an extremely popular blog , and so do John Redwood MP , Nadine Dorries MP and even the Foreign Secretary David Milliband .
However , Hazel Blears is probably not suggesting that her colleagues " fuel a culture of cynicism " .
Instead , she has aimed her attack at irresponsible writing , particularly by right - wing bloggers , explaining : " Blogs have only existed under a Labour government .
Perhaps if there was a Tory government , all the leading blogs would be left - of - centre ? "
Is that correct ?
Not really .
The most popular British political blogs are right - leaning but there are many popular left - wing and independent political blogs too .
Harry 's Place , written by , among others , Harry Hatchet ; and Labour Councillor Bob Piper 's blog are successful left - wing sites .
So what else is Hazel Blears concerned about ?
The Communities Secretary says that politics is dominated by a professional political class which is leading to low voter turnout in the UK and too few diverse political voices .
She has a point .
There are only 126 women in the House of Commons and 147 in the House of Lords – less than 20 per cent .
The minister also attacked the media as sensationalist , warning : " We are witnessing a dangerous corrosion in our political culture . "
She is not the first to draw this conclusion .
Right - wing political pundit Peter Oborne wrote a book last year called The Political Class in which he described how political parties were breaking down at the grass roots .
He argued that Parliament is dominated by career politicians who have little knowledge of life outside the Westminster " bubble " .
Politicians of all sides cannot help but notice that the House of Commons is full of white , middle - class and middle - aged men .
As for the role of the press , Blears is not the first to criticise that either .
In one of his final speeches , the former Prime Minister , Tony Blair , attacked the media 's " feral beasts " .
Is our democracy under threat ?
The queues outside polling stations in the US earlier this week seem remarkable in the UK .
And the popular membership of political parties is at a record low .
Voter turnout at general elections has dropped by 20 per cent since 1992 , so it is difficult to make the case that our political life is flourishing .
However , the explanation may not lie with the media or the blogosphere but with our political institutions and our elected officials .
Polling suggests that people do not believe that their vote counts .
Hundreds of parliamentary constituencies are considered to be " safe seats " which give their candidates such huge majorities that individual ballots are irrelevant .
Similarly , voters express increasing frustration about government in general : that their wishes are ignored and that so many decisions are made by experts appointed by politicians .
This powerlessness is also perceived by local government politicians who feel that too much power over the decisions they make is held by Whitehall .
Only by pushing for reform of Britain 's political institutions , they argue , will we change our political culture .
Can the internet help ?
Blears thinks so .
It is an alarming statistic the most popular party website is that of the British National Party .
Drawing her cue from the success of President - elect Obama , she believes that mainstream parties must learn to use the web as a fundraising and campaigning tool which may lure people away from the bloggers towards " considered " debate .
Who is the blogger that the minister finds most objectionable ?
She singles out Tory - leaning writer Guido Fawkes as an " anti-establishment " peddler of " vicious nihilism " – which is perhaps fitting , since his online nom de guerre pays homage to the plotter who tried to blow up Parliament .
His real name is Paul Staines .
Fawkes breaks stories that are regularly covered by the rest of the media .
In January he was widely credited for defenestrating Cabinet Minister Peter Hain by many journalists and politicians , including Blears ' colleague Diane Abbott MP .
He has reacted to the minister 's comments , unsurprisingly , on his blog : " Asking political bloggers to add value is to misunderstand the relationship between a free press and politicians .
Take a memo Ms Blears , we are not here to " add value " , or do what politicians want .
Guido has his own values and aims to hit back at political hypocrisy and lies .
Politicians make laws , so they should be held to account , to a higher standard . "
Who actually reads political blogs ?
Political blogs have a reputation for only being of interest to the " Westminster Village " and anorak - clad political obsessives .
A recent post by Iain Dale , for example , chewed around the idea that former Tory minister Michael Portillo thinks that Gordon Brown is thinking about holding an election – it 's specialised stuff .
However , the reach is huge .
In the past 12 months Fawkes ' blog received some 867,210 unique visitors .
Nor is political blogging confined to Westminster .
The left - leaning blog Labour of Love is edited by an activist based in Manchester called Chris Paul , who writes about northern politics .
What do Labour bloggers make of the speech ?
They have already blogged about it .
Chris Paul 's reaction is to see it as a row between the minister and Fawkes : " Let us hope that any creature of the mainstream media who has been paying attention to the venal , careless , vendetta - driven dolt ( Fawkes ) will instead switch to listening to Hazel who , when she is not wielding the smoking starting pistol in the Cluedo library , is a great asset to the Labour Party . "
If they are so good , why do n't bloggers write in other media ?

They do .
Conservative blogger Iain Dale now commentates for Sky and the BBC , is publisher of Total Politics magazine and writes regularly for The Daily Telegraph .
Similarly , Paul Staines has appeared ( admittedly in disguise ) on political programmes .
What 's more , most newspapers and leading journalists have blogs which gives them a dynamic relationship with their readers .
All of which is , arguably , good for popular democracy .
Is the political process ill - served by bloggers ?
Yes ...
* Bloggers are not professional journalists and , often unedited and untrained , can be misleading .
* By viciously attacking politicians they make it more difficult for everyone to engage in a debate .
* They can become a hub for slurs and anonymous , unwarranted attacks on politicians across the UK .
No ...
* Political bloggers are subject to the laws of defamation , and are every bit as powerful and well connected as other journalists .
* Blogs represent free speech – the mark of a healthy democracy .
* Bloggers create engaging content which encourages discussion and that is great for democracy .
EL AUJA BORDER CROSSING , Egypt  France sent technical equipment to help Gazans draw water from the ground .
The Swiss sent blankets and plastic tarps .
Mercy Corps , a relief agency , sent 12 truckloads of food .
And on Tuesday all of it , including dozens of other trucks carrying sugar , rice , flour , juice and baby formula , sat in the hot sun here going nowhere .
This normally quiet commercial crossing between Egypt and Israel has been turned into a parking lot of stalled , humanitarian aid , and in the city of El Arish there are even greater quantities of food , clothing and essential supplies , sitting , waiting and baking in the sun .
Some supplies are loaded onto dozens of trucks parked on city streets , but much more is stored in the open areas of a local sports stadium , also waiting , also going nowhere .
Only medical supplies seem to be getting through to Gaza .
Since the cease - fire , Israel has allowed some humanitarian supplies into Gaza , but the territory is still desperately short of the necessities .
Israel closed all the crossings into Gaza on Tuesday after an Israeli soldier was killed in a bombing on the Israeli side of the border .
But that changed nothing at this crossing , where the flow has been stalled for days .
Officials and volunteers in Egypt blame the Israelis , saying that even before the passage stalled Israel had allowed supplies to pass through for only 19 hours each week .
Israeli officials said that Egypt had not done enough to coordinate the flood of aid coming to Gaza , and that they hoped a system would soon be in place to remedy the problem .
Obama is apparently preparing to carry through on his campaign promise to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and Bob Gates has instructed the Pentagon to draw up contingency plans for doing so ( h/t Kat ) .
Steve Benen and Kevin Drum are both happy that Obama is n't backing away from his promise , and so am I .
But the plan seems to involve closing Gitmo within two years , and that 's too long .
It means that for two years detainees , many of them innocent of all charges as even the Bush administration nowadays has been forced to admit , will either continue to be subjected to kangaroo courts rebranded as " tribunals " or held in illegal imprisonment if tribunals are suspended .
It means that those who ordered illegal rendition , torture , years of imprisonment without trial , repudiation of the Geneva Conventions and the trashing of America 's legal system so as to allow evidence obtained by torture to be admissable while habeas corpus pleas were not will have an extra two years to argue by proxy that criminal charges would be politically inadvisable .
It will mean two years in which Obama 's administration and its foreign policy goals will be tarred abroad with the brush that Bush fashioned , because the rest of the world looks at America and does n't distinguish as carefully between administrations as do partisan Americans .
And most importantly , it means two more years of the greatest gift to terrorist recruitment , which means more people will die .
" Matthew Alexander " , the Air Force Major who was an interrogator in Iraq and has been highly critical of " enhanced interrogation " told Scott Horton in an interview published Friday :
The number - one reason foreign fighters gave for coming to Iraq to fight is the torture and abuse that occurred at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo .
The majority of suicide bombings are carried out by foreign fighters who volunteered and came to Iraq with this motivation .
Consequently it is clear that at least hundreds but more likely thousands of American lives ( not to count Iraqi civilian deaths ) are linked directly to the policy decision to introduce the torture and abuse of prisoners as accepted tactics .
Americans have died from terrorist attacks since 9/11 ; those Americans just happen to be American soldiers .
This is not simply my view–it is widely held among senior officers in the U.S. military today .
Alberto Mora , who served as General Counsel of the Navy under Donald Rumsfeld , testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee in June 2008 that “ U.S. flag - rank officers maintain that the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat deaths in Iraq–as judged by their effectiveness in recruiting insurgent fighters into combat–are , respectively the symbols of Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo . ”
It 's quite possible to close Gitmo far faster .
If the U.S. can make a case against any detainee without using illegally obtained evidence , let it do so without delay in either ordinary civilian or military courts with the full panoply of law available .
Such accused should be held in normal civilian or military custody while their trials progress
For those it cannot , if the U.S. can make a case without using illegally obtained evidence that they would ordinarily be granted admission to the country , let them be deported - again without delay .
Anyone not in those two categories should be released without prejudice and citizens of a free nation which upholds certain standards will just have to accept any danger concomittant with restoring those standards which the Bush administration has so widely trampled .
We accept the same danger of further crimes every time an accused murderer or rapist is tried and might be aquitted , or is released on technical grounds because the normal course of law was not followed - as we should - so what 's the problem ?
That is the only answer consistent with the universal rule of law , and could be implemented on Day One .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It 's a sign of the times : Americans are pulling back on the debt they use to spend and fuel the economy , while their net worth is declining .
The government reported Thursday that household debt in the third quarter fell for the first time ever .
Meanwhile , net worth dropped by the largest amount on record based on data going back to 1951 .
Household debt fell by a seasonally adjusted $ 30 billion , or an annualized 0.8 % in the third quarter to $ 13.91 trillion , according to the Federal Reserve 's flow of funds report .
Americans holding less debt may sound like a positive , but it also means consumers are spending less , as debt has become more expensive and harder to come by .
" Interest rates have shot rapidly higher in the last few months , and people are borrowing less because they do n't want expensive credit hanging over their heads , " said Michael Englund , chief economist for Action Economics .
" The other component is the credit crunch , where qualified borrowers are unable to get credit . "
Debt mainly fell because more than a million Americans have lost their homes to foreclosure since the housing crisis hit in August 2007 .
When a home is foreclosed upon , the debt is transferred away from the homeowner to the bank .
As a result , home mortgage debt sank a whopping 2.4 % in the quarter .
As the credit crunch intensified in the third quarter - and exploded late in the period with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers - Americans were increasingly unable to finance big purchases like homes , cars and big - ticket goods .
Accordingly , consumer credit rose by a measly 1.2 % in the quarter , the lowest seasonally adjusted rise of that measure since the second quarter of 1992 .
Automobile purchases have been sinking all year , but began to fall sharply in the third quarter as the credit tightened .
Auto dealers across the country have reported that many consumers are interested in buying cars but cannot acquire the financing to purchase them .
Furthermore , the U.S. economy has shed 1.9 million jobs so far in 2008 , with precipitous declines since September .
As a result , the economy has entered a vicious cycle , in which Americans spend less and have less to spend .
" Today 's announcement shows us that American households are pulling back on spending in the face of strong headwinds in the job market , and it highlights the reduced willingness of a still - stretched financial sector to extend credit , " said Economic Policy Institute economist Josh Bivens in a statement .
" Neither tells us anything good about the kind of economic growth we can expect over the next year . "
That 's a worrisome sign for the economy , as consumer spending makes up 70 % of overall U.S. gross domestic product .
The economy entered a long and deep recession in December 2007 , and the prospect of a turnaround will weigh heavily on consumers ' confidence to spend money .
" Everyone over the past three months decided to become thrifty at the same time , but our incomes depend on other people spending , " said Englund .
" If we all start saving and cut back on our spending at the same time , it means more people will ultimately get fired . "
And fourth - quarter debt data is likely to be even lower , as the peak of the credit crisis came in mid-October .
" There has been a particularly steep rise in the savings rate recently , " said Englund .
" With a large part of thriftiness due to panic , this trend could continue for a long time . "
Net worth in 12 - month tailspin
Consumers watched their net worth fall for the fourth quarter in a row as it dropped by $ 2.8 trillion , or 4.7 % , to $ 56.5 trillion , dragged down by huge drops in home values and in the stock market .
It was the largest decline in the 57 - year history of the report .
Americans ' wealth also sank $ 393 billion in the second quarter , $ 2.4 trillion in the first quarter and $ 1.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
Until then , net worth had been rising steadily since 2003 , climbing nearly 31 % over those five years .
The four straight quarters of declines have resulted in a net 11.1 % drop in Americans ' wealth in the last 12 months .
During the bear market of 2000 through 2002 , household 's net worth dropped just 6.2 % .
The net value of financial assets for households fell by $ 2.1 trillion , or 4.4 % , led mainly by falling values of stock holdings and mutual funds .
Americans ' share of corporate equities plummeted $ 943.5 billion - an 11.5 % drop - in the quarter , to $ 7.3 trillion .
With major stock indexes like the S&P 500 falling 40 % or more since January , shares of mutual funds , a primary investment of 401 ( k ) retirement funds , declined $ 597.4 billion , or 12.4 % , to $ 4.2 trillion .
Financial assets account for about two - thirds of households ' net worth , but consumers have also been hit hard by sinking home prices .
Home values fell by $ 347 billion in the quarter to $ 19.1 trillion .
" Consumers are going through a major change in their spending and savings habits , " said Lyle Gramley , a former Fed Governor .
" Throughout the housing bubble , consumers had a savings rate of zero , relying on the rising price of their homes .
Now they 're saving money for the future instead of spending it . "

In my latest installment of ' Top 10 ' lists , I thought I would compile a post that would be of use to the general public .
Bashing Republicans and Democrats is good fun , but ' How To ' lists are slightly more practical in our confusing political environment .
Over the past 8 years , we have learned that threats to our national security do not consist of Iraqis , Weapons of Mass Destruction , gay marriage or ' Welfare Queens ' , despite the Bush Administration 's insistence that they do .
The greatest threat comes from a cabal of extreme imperialistic fanatics hell bent on attacking Arab countries and spreading McDonald 's style capitalism around the world .

Otherwise known as the ' Neo Cons ' , their relentless dedication to violence , reckless spending and incompetent governance has led to the catastrophic disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan , hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths , the disintegration of the economy and spiraling mistrust of government .
It 's easy to spot the homosexuals destroying the fabric of American life ( look out for groomed facial hair , tight pants and a weak handshake ) , Arabs ( again , facial hair ) , and Welfare Queens ( anyone who is n't white ) , but how do you spot a Neo Con ?

Here 's a how to guide preparing you for the easily ignored sociopath :
1. The Neo Con is characteristically white and unathletic .
Think Woody Allen meets Dick Cheney .
Here 's an example :
2 . When discussing poetry , if the conversation keeps moving towards high powered weaponry , American military history , and the ' power of the free market ' , you are most likely talking to a Neo Con .
Proceed with extreme caution .
3 . The typical Neo Con has no actual experience in the military , or of real fighting .
He will most likely have been bullied physically by older boys at school , and as a consequence , feels the need to exact violence on as many people as possible .
He is liable to outburst of uncontrolled aggression , so make sure he has no access to weapons ( he wo n't attack otherwise ) .
4. Neo Cons are unusually smug and self - satisfied .
Convinced of their own moral clarity , the Neo Con displays an air of superiority and is likely to dismiss counter arguments quickly .
Have facts to counter his ?
It wo n't matter , as Neo Cons rely on a tautological loophole that justifies pretty much anything .
An aid to the Bush White House once told a reporter ,
" We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you 're studying that reality -- judiciously , as you will -- we 'll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that 's how things will sort out .
We 're history 's actors . . . and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . "
Brilliant .
5 . The Neo Con is a virulent proponent of ' Exceptionalism '- the belief that their country is morally superior to everyone else .
If you are a foreigner and disagree with this assertion , do not expect him to take you seriously .
He will not understand why you do not want to be an American , and will look to convince you by a massive display of military might and sneering arrogance .
Neo Cons are likely to have access to people still in places of power , so be especially careful if your country is particularly small and defenseless .
You may well be invaded .
6 . In almost all circumstances , Neo Conservatives are incapable of drawing meaningful historical analogies and make frequent comparisons between tin pot dictators of bankrupt third world countries ( Saddam Hussein ) and Adolf Hitler , ( the leader of the most technologically and industrially advanced country of its time ) .
As we have seen , the Neo Con has his own particular method of reasoning , which may not appear logical to the naked eye .
For example , the Neo Con rationale for invading Iraq goes as follows :
We invade Iraq because Al Qaeda is there , even though they only came because we invaded .
Confused ?
Do n't worry , there is a perfectly reasonable explanation .
As George Bush put it plainly , ' " So What ? "
7 . Most typically , the Neo Conservative believes strongly in the welfare state .
A limitless supply of money should be available for government contractors , the military industrial complex , and giant corporations should they not survive the market .
If you have paid to help elect a Neo Con , you may also be entitled to government dollars .
8. Paradoxically , the Neo Conservative is also a militant free marketer and will go to great lengths to explain the beauty of laissez faire economics .
He believes government intervention in areas that benefit the working class , the sick and the uneducated breeds dependency and moral depravity , and the free market will separate the worthy from the unworthy .
The Neo Con wants harsh market discipline for the majority of the working population , and government subsidies for the privileged and wealthy .
A somewhat schizophrenic view , you may say ?
Maybe , but remember , the Neo Con does not answer to mere mortals .
He is the law unto himself .
9 . An astonishing ability to predict that exact opposite of what will happen is another defining characteristic of the Neo Conservative .
Check out this golden nugget from William Kristol :
" If [ Hillary Clinton ] gets a race against John Edwards and Barack Obama , she 's going to be the nominee .
Gore is the only threat to her , then .
... Barack Obama is not going to beat Hillary Clinton in a single Democratic primary .
I 'll predict that right now . " -- Fox News Sunday , Dec. 17 , 2006
Kristol 's litany of catastrophic predictions was so impressive , he landed a gig at the New York Times , proof that no matter how badly the upper classes screw up , they can always find a job .
10 .
Most disturbing is the Neo Conservative 's willingness to sacrifice others for their ideals .
Take for example , chief war cheerleader Dick Cheney .
The current VP has supported pretty much every war Bill Clinton was not involved in yet has religiously avoided any service himself .
Check this incredible fact out about the Dark Prince .
According to the New York Times :
On Oct. 6 , 1965 , the Selective Service lifted its ban against drafting married men who had no children .
Exactly nine months and two days later , Mr. Cheney 's first daughter , Elizabeth , was born .
No kidding .
Cheney also deferred 5 times from military duty , stating : " I had other priorities in the '60s than military service . "
Expect the Neo Con to use this type of justification when confronted with hard questions , an ability that gets better with age .
Just watch Cheney 's response when told that two thirds of Americans feel the Iraq War was not worth it :
If only life for everyone else was so easy .

The prince warned relations between the two countries could suffer
A senior member of Saudi Arabia 's ruling family has warned the US that it needs to change attitudes over the Arab - Israeli conflict .
Prince Turki al - Faisal , a former Saudi intelligence chief and former ambassador to the US , said a failure to alter policies could threaten links .
The prince said ex-President George W Bush had left a " sickening legacy " in the Middle East .
He accused the US of contributing to the killing of Gazans .
Special envoy named
The prince made his comments in an interview with the London - based Financial Times newspaper .
On 27 December , Israel launched a three - week assault on the Gaza Strip which killed more than 1,300 people and resulted in massive destruction .
The aim , Israel said , was to stop rocket fire into Israel by Palestinian militant groups .
Thirteen Israelis were killed during the conflict .
On Thursday Barack Obama made his first public statement on the Middle East as US president .
He named former senator George Mitchell as a special envoy to the Middle East .
Correspondents say President Obama 's first statement did not significantly depart from earlier US policies .
Rocket attacks jolt Israel as Gaza war blazes on Agence France - Presse

GAZA CITY ( AFP ) - Rockets fired into northern Israel from Lebanon on Thursday jolted efforts to end the war in Gaza where Israeli jets carried out mass strikes on smuggling tunnels .
Three rockets fired at the northern Israeli town of Nahariya injured two women as Israel sent an envoy to Cairo to discuss an Egyptian plan to end the war on the Hamas movement which has left at least 704 dead in Gaza .
The Israeli army fired shells into Lebanon at the district where the rockets came from .
Residents quickly started to flee fearing a new war front .
Sirens sounded again three hours later but it turned out to be a false alert .
Hamas denied it had fired the rockets and the Lebanese government said Hezbollah , the Shiite Lebanese militants who were the target of an Israeli war in 2006 , had also made it clear they were not involved .
The Israeli government made no immediate comment on the strikes .
But media cited military sources as saying the rockets were probably fired by Lebanon - based Palestinian radicals angered by the offensive in the Gaza Strip .
With the military onslaught in its 13th day , Israeli jets pounded zones near the border with Egypt where Israel says there are hundreds of underground tunnels used by Hamas to smuggle in arms .
Witnesses said Israeli tanks had also entered southern Gaza .
Israeli planes dropped tens of thousands of leaflets on the Rafah area near the border warning people to leave their houses or face attacks .
There are up to 500 underground passages around Rafah , used to smuggle supplies and arms from Egypt into Gaza .
There were also new air raids in the north of the densely populated coastal strip , with three people hurt when a mosque was hit in Gaza City , medics said .
Amid the raids , the Red Cross made new efforts to get more than 200 foreigners out of Gaza .
Several convoys have been cancelled because of fighting near the border .
Gaza medics said 704 people have now been killed and more than 3,100 injured since Israel launched Operation Cast Lead on December 27 -- starting with air strikes on Hamas military and government targets and following it up with a ground offensive last Saturday .
Israel says it wants to stop Hamas rocket attacks across the border and the arms smuggling .
Three more rockets were fired into southern Israel from Gaza on Thursday but the Israeli army said there would be a new three - hour halt to its bombing from 1100 GMT to 1400 GMT throughout the territory so the population can get food .
Six Israeli soldiers have been killed in the combat while three civilians and a soldier have been killed in rockets fired into Israel since December 27 .
Israel 's security cabinet has agreed to pursue the offensive , but new hopes have been raised by a truce plan proposed by Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak .
A top Israeli envoy went to Cairo on Thursday for talks on the ceasefire proposal which aims to halt the conflict while bolstering security on the Gaza - Egypt frontier to end the smuggling .
Amos Gilad , an advisor to Defence Minister Ehud Barak , was to hold talks with Egyptian officials on the plan which has secured widespread international backing .
Israel 's President Shimon Peres said ceasefire plan was " a general idea " with the details to be hammered out .
The process " could take several days , " he told Italian newspaper La Repubblica .
Peres also said Gaza must not be allowed to become a " satellite of Iran . "
Western foreign ministers , including US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , extended their stay at the United Nations in New York to hold new talks with Arab counterparts on a compromise Security Council text on a Gaza truce .
" We believe there 's still work to do , " Rice told reporters .
Libya has submitted a draft resolution that " demands an immediate end " to the Israeli offensive .
A rival non-binding statement circulated by France , which chairs the UN Security Council this month , would merely stress " the urgent need for an immediate and durable ceasefire " and would welcome Egypt 's truce initiative .
Arab ministers want a vote on the Libyan draft , which requires nine votes and no veto from the council 's five permanent members -- Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States -- for passage .
A diplomat said Arab ministers did not want to return home empty - handed and face the wrath of their public , which has been outraged by the images of bloodshed .
New protests against the Israeli offensive were held around the world .
Hundreds of Muslim students stormed a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in the Indonesian city of Palu waving Palestinian flags and burning the US and Israeli emblems .
Los Angeles Lakers center Andrew Bynum 's foul on Charlotte Bobcats forward Gerald Wallace in Tuesday night 's game has been upgraded from a Flagrant - 1 to the more serious Flagrant - 2 violation , the Lakers learned from the NBA on Thursday .
Wallace suffered a cracked rib and partially collapsed lung as a result of the collision .
He left Staples Center on a stretcher and was taken to Centinela Hospital .
Bynum told the Los Angeles Daily News on Thursday he called Wallace 's cell phone and left a message .
" I did n't try to hurt him , " Bynum told the Daily News .
" His momentum was great , and if you look at the play , once he hit me I kind of spun around because I did n't know he was coming that fast .
" I wish him the best of luck and hope that he recovers . "
Bobcats coach Larry Brown said he did n't think Bynum should be suspended .
" That kid waited at our bus , trying to get to Gerald , and he apologized to me , '' Brown told The Charlotte Observer .
" If he had a history of that [ rough play ] , I might feel different , but I just think it was a hard foul . "
Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne , of West Palm Beach , Florida has successfully completed the third round of its Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine ( CECE ) testing for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .
CECE is a new deep throttling engine designed to reduce thrust and allow a spacecraft to land gently on the moon , Mars , or some other non-terrestrial surface .
The CECE engine is being designed under a joint development project involving Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne , NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Alabama , and NASA ’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland , Ohio .
It ’s based on the existing Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RL10 upper stage rocket engine and uses a combination of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to generate 13,800 pounds of thrust .
The liquid oxygen is used at about 90 degrees Kelvin ( approximately - 297 degrees Fahrenheit ) and the liquid hydrogen at 20 degrees Kelvin ( approximately - 423 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
The two propellants super cool the engine components and generate a gas made of hot steam that ’s pushed out of the nozzle to create the thrust .
As the steam passes through the cold nozzle , condensation occurs and the resulting water eventually freezes into icicles as it exits .
This third round of testing throttled the engine from 104 percent of its expected potential thrust down to 8 percent .
This is a record for an engine of this type and beats the expected 100 percent to 10 percent change .
Previous testing induced chugging , or pressure oscillations , at lower levels of throttling .
Careful adjustments of the injector and propellant feeding systems to better control the flow of the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the engine have eliminated the chugging in the latest tests .
The CECE engine is expected to be a prototype design rather than an engine actually used in spaceflight .
However , NASA expects the technology used to solve problems with CECE will be incorporated into another cryogenic engine and eventually used in the Altair Lunar Lander that ’s part of the current Constellation program .
Thus , CECE represents an important step in the lunar lander design .

The remote , frozen landscape provides an ideal backdrop for the vault Almost 90,000 food crop seed samples have arrived at the " doomsday vault " in the Arctic Circle , as part of its first anniversary celebrations .
The four - tonne shipment takes the number of seeds stored in the frozen repository to more than 20 million .
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault , built 130 m ( 426 ft ) inside a mountain , aims to protect the world 's food crop species against natural and human disasters .
The £ 5 m ( $ 7 m ) facility took 12 months to build and opened in February 2008 .
" The vault was opened last year to ensure that , one day , all of humanity 's existing food crop varieties would be safely protected , " explained Cary Fowler , executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust ( GCDT ) .
" It 's amazing how far we have come towards accomplishing that goal . "
The arrival of the latest consignment of seed samples means that the vault , deep inside a mountain on Norway 's Svalbard archipelago , is now storing a third of the planet 's most important food crop varieties .
Among the anniversary arrivals are 32 varieties of potatoes from Ireland 's national gene banks .
It is thought the lack of diversity in Ireland 's potato crops played a major part in the spread of blight through the nation 's harvests in the mid-1800s , contributing to the Great Famine .
The vault , operated by a partnership between the GCDT and the Norwegian government , stores duplicates of seeds held in national collections .
It acts as a fail - safe backup if the original collections are lost or damaged .
The permafrost helps maintain the vault 's sub -zero temperatures " We are especially proud to see such a large number of countries working quickly to provide samples from their collections for safekeeping in the vault , " said Norway 's Agriculture Minister Lars Peder Brekk .
" It shows that there are situations in the world today capable of transcending politics and inspiring a strong unity of purpose among a diverse community of nations . "
As well as the consignment of seeds , experts on climate change and food production have gathered in Longyearbyen for a three - day anniversary conference .
They will examine how climate change threatens global food production , and how crop diversity will improve food security for people in regions that are going to be worst affected .
Frank Loy , an environment adviser to President Obama , said : " When we see research indicating that global warming could diminish maize production by 30 % in southern Africa in only 20 years ' time , it shows that crop diversity is needed to adapt agriculture to climate change right now . "

Weird and scary Christian chapel – Sedlec Ossuary
The Sedlec Ossuary is a small macabre Christian chapel .
This strange place is located beneath the Cemetery Church of All Saints in Sedlec , a suburb of Kutn ?
Hora in the Czech Republic .
The ossuary was built for mass graves unearthed during construction , or simply slated for abolition to make room for new burials .
Its interior is composed exclusively of approximately 40,000 human skeletons which have been ordered and artistically arranged to form decorations and furnishings for the chapel .
Interesting and scary , the ossuary has an enormous chandelier of bones , which contains at least one of every bone in the human body , piers and monstrances near the altar , a large Schwarzenberg coat - of - arms , and the signature of Master Rint , on the wall near the entrance .
NEW YORK , Feb. 18 ( UPI ) -- A New York man is facing charges he stole a six - story apartment building and then tried to get a $ 1 million mortgage on it , city officials said Wednesday .
Fernando Maldonado , 47 , of Brooklyn allegedly filed a phony deed with the New York City Finance and Buildings departments and then tried to defraud a lender , the city said in a news release .
He now faces numerous charges that could land him behind bars for years , city officials said .

" Stealing a building and using it in an effort to steal more than a million dollars in loan money , as charged here , is about as brazen a scam as can be imagined , " city Investigation Department Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn said .
" But with a paper trail of phony documents , and a string of charges that can lead to substantial prison terms , the foolishness of the scheme has been exposed . "
Maldonado allegedly was able to move his scheme forward because he previously had been president of the property 's cooperative board and his name appeared on the original deed .
But he had n't even been a tenant of the building since 1992 .

Last month , Boxee added the ability for Netflix subscribers to browse and download Netflix videos from within Boxee .
The new Netflix support was initially released for Mac users , but the company says it expects to add the support to the AppleTV and Linux versions of Boxee “ early in 2009 . ”
Presumably the Netflix capability already is implemented in the Windows version , since the necessary functionality is readily available for Windows XP and Vista ( Netflix offers a player for those OSes ) .
Here are a few screenshots of Boxee ’s recently - added Netflix support running on the Mac OS X version ( courtesy of Boxee ) :

The " I Trust My Legs " gold mine in Ghana is a local affair , where miners shift silt from rudimentary pits and then combine it with mercury .
The element ( a toxic metal that can cause brain damage ) captures all the gold in the dirt and then , when the mixture is heated , dissipates into the air , leaving just gold bits behind .
Unfortunately , in what is known as artisanal mining , the mercury also enters the lungs of miners , their families and others nearby .
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) estimates that some 15 million miners , their families and neighbors ( including 4.5 million women and 600,000 children ) are affected by the fumes , which are known to cause brain damage and even death .
Such gold mining is just one of world 's most pressing global pollution problems , according to the Blacksmith Institute , an environmental health group based in New York City .
Among the others : air pollution in homes from cooking , industrial smog in cities , untreated sewage , metal smelting and the recycling of lead ( which causes brain damage ) from old batteries .
" We reviewed the broad stretch of different kinds of pollution problems that show up around the world and evaluated them according to their gross health risk , " says Blacksmith founder Richard Fuller .
" We have exported our industry overseas and there are no pollution controls in these places or they are terribly inadequate .
So you end up with toxic hot spots . "
The institute and its panel of 19 experts analyzed more than 600 such toxic hot spots and the problems they pose ; they then evaluated these issues on the toxicity of the pollutant in question , its effect on humans , and the overall number of people impacted .
The top 10 , in alphabetical order , are : artisanal gold mining ; contaminated surface water ; contaminated groundwater ; indoor air pollution ; metals smelting and processing ; industrial mining ; radioactive waste and uranium mining ; untreated sewage ; urban air quality ; and used lead–acid battery recycling .
Slide Show : Living with World 's Worst Pollution
It is not just the workers in each of these areas who face the biggest threat , but rather the women of child - bearing age and their children , Fuller says .
" Children are not just mini-adults .
They are , in fact , growing and are much more susceptible to environmental pollutants than adults . "
He notes that the lead released during the course of lead–acid battery recycling ups the levels in children 's blood to 50 to 100 micrograms per deciliter , or as much as 10 times higher than levels deemed safe by the World Health Organization .
Each 10 microgram per deciliter rise in lead levels lowers intelligence levels by four to seven points on IQ tests , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Many of these problems , including untreated sewage and urban air pollution , have either been solved or diminished in the developed world , and there 's no reason they could n't also be solved in the developing world , Fuller says .
" It 's a doable , solvable problem . "
The institute is currently putting together a global inventory of polluted places with funding from the European Commission and UNIDO in an attempt to get a handle on the extent of the problem .
And the problems created by the pollutants are not confined to the areas immediately surrounding these types of pollution .
Mercury vapor , for instance , once burned off by the artisanal miners can drift high into the atmosphere where it crosses continents and even oceans before settling back to the ground .
Once in the food chain it bio-accumulates ( increases in concentration as it passes up the chain from plant to plant - eater to meat - eater ) until it reaches top concentrations in predators such as tuna fish .
" Many of the toxins we find in our evaluation are transboundary and actually move from the point of emission over to our own ecosystem and food chain , " Fuller notes .
" So mercury from artisanal gold mining can end up in tuna to poison our own children . "
In this fourth post ( parts one , two and three are found here ) on the State of the Computer Book Market , we will look at programming languages and drill in a little on each language area .
Overall the market for programming languages was down 5.9 % in 2008 when compared with 2007 .
There were 1,849,974 units sold in 2007 versus 1,740,808 units sold in 2008 , which is a decrease of 109,166 units .
So the unhealthy 8 % loss in the Overall Computer Book Market was not completely fueled by programming - oriented books .
Before we begin to drill in on the languages , we thought it would be best to explain our “ language dimension . ”
When we group books by their language dimension , we categorize them by the language used in their code examples .
So Flash Programming with Java would be in our Flash atomic category , but the language dimension would be Java .
Similarly , our Head First Design Patterns book contains all examples written in Java , so it too carries the “ java ” tag on the language dimension .
A Treemap view of the Programming Languages
In the above treemap view , you ’ll notice a couple of bright green areas — namely Objective - C and ActionScript .
PHP and C# are dark green and show a nice growth when compared to the rest of the larger languages in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
Unfortunately what this does not show is a visual reference for how the size of the box changes over time .
We reported last year that Ruby had grown nicely , had passed Perl and Python , and was knocking on the door for Visual Basic ’s spot .
However , Ruby had the largest decrease in unit sales in 2008 .
Of the large languages , the following show a healthy growth trend in 2008 : C# with 17,397 more units , PHP with 10,896 more units , ActionScript with 23,881 more units , and Python with 11,517 more units .
Last year we reported that C# should surpass Java as the number one language this year . ”
C# is now the largest programming language for all book sales , and that was the case for all of 2008 .
If you look at the five - year trend for the languages shown below , you can see that C# has been steadily growing year after year while Java has been going in the opposite direction during the same period .
PHP , ActionScript and Python are the other languages going in a positive direction .
Ruby , Java , and C++ had the biggest declines in unit sales during 2008 , and Ruby dropped out of the top 10 languages .
2008 Market Share
Before we dive in , let ’s look at the high - level picture for the grouping of languages .
As you can see in the table below , the Major and Immaterial languages experienced growth in 2008 while the rest experienced a decline .
The languages driving the growth in the Immaterial category are Alice , Haskell and F#. Titles in this category will be moving up as functional languages continue to take off .
In the Major group it was Objective - C and Python that carried the group to a positive number compared to 2007 .
Category Category Unit Range 2008 Units 2007 Units Growth Large 100,000 – 275,000 1,075,317 1,173,444 -98,127 Major 28,000 – 99,999 508,431 441,739 66,692 Minor 5,000 – 27,999

For the sake of grouping and presenting this information in a more readable format , we have classified the categories for the languages in this way with the following headers :
* Large * U N I T S T I T L E S M A R K E T S H A R E 1 . Language 2 . 2008

The following table contains data for the Large languages .
As you can see , C# , PHP and ActionScript were the only languages experiencing growth .
It is interesting to note that last year we reported that PHP was surprisingly down , yet it rebounded in 2008 and showed a nice 1 % market share growth .
ActionScript joined the large languages up from the Major language group .
The .NET Languages dropped out of the Large category and is now in the Major language group .
JavaScript lost ground despite seeing more titles make the top 3000 .
Those JavaScript titles sold fewer units per book .

Here are the top titles for the Large languages , and incidentally , the titles and order are the same whether you look at Units sold or Dollars generated :
You ’ll notice in the Mid-Major languages that Python and Objective - C are the two languages that are showing growth when you compare 2008 and 2007 .
Objective - C has one of the largest market share growths for all languages .
It seems as though developers really want to build iPhone and Mac applications — not sure what else this growth could be attributed to .

So the news in this category is that Lua , Processing and C had the largest growth in units , 7 out of 12 languages in the category experienced unit growth .
It is interesting to see Lua come out of nowhere and sell a bunch of units .
Lua got a boost from the World of Warcraft title below that teaches some introductory Lua and uses the language in its examples .

Immaterial Programming Languages — 1,000 – 1,999 units in 2008
The following languages all sold between 1 and 999 units in Q1 ’ 07 .
These are what I am considering the Immaterial programming languages .
It should be noted that in 2009 , our Real World Haskell book as already sold as much as the whole Haskell market did in 2008 .
The noticeable trend with the Immaterial languages is large growth of F# and NXT .

Pay attention to this space , as I will be publishing this information twice a year .
Now that we have all the queries , spreadsheets , pivot - tables and systems down , we should be able to update these posts much more easily going forward .
If you have anything you would like explored a bit more thoroughly , please leave a comment here and we will see what we can do .
Earlier tonight I added support for the Mint Bird Feeder plugin to my site 's RSS feeds .
Bird Feeder is n't designed to work with Django so I had to change a few things to get it up and running .
I mostly followed the instructions on Hicks - Wright .
net with a few tweaks .
While I was trying to get things running smoothly I had to redeploy the site a bunch of times so I could test the changes I made .
If I were simply FTP'ing the files over each time I wanted to redeploy it would have been a huge pain .
Fortunately , I have another way to do it that cuts down on my typing .
The code for my site is stored in a Mercurial repository .
There are actually three copies of the repository that I use :
One is on my local machine , which I commit to as I make changes .
One is on BitBucket , which I use to share the code with the public .
One is on my host 's webserver , and is what actually gets served as the website .
When I 'm ready to deploy a new version of the site , I push the changes I 've made on my local repository to the one on BitBucket , then pull the changes from BitBucket down to the server .
Using push / pull means I do n't have to worry about transferring the files myself .
Using BitBucket in the middle ( instead of going right from my local machine to the server ) means I do n't have to worry about serving either repository myself and dealing with port forwarding or security issues .
Using BitBucket as an intermediate repository is actually fairly simple .
Here are the basic steps I use to get a project up and running like this .
First , create a new repository on BitBucket .
Make sure the name is what you want .
Feel free to make it private if you just want it for this , or public if you want to go open source .
Clone this new , empty repository to your local machine .
If you already have code written you 'll need to copy it into this folder after cloning .
I do n't know if there 's a way to push a brand - new repository to BitBucket ; if you know how please tell me .
On your local machine , edit the .hg / hgrc file in the repository and change the default path to :
default = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org /username/repositoryname/
That will let you push / pull to and from BitBucket over SSH .
Doing it that way means you can use public / private key authentication and avoid typing your password every single time .
A fairly comprehensive guide to that can be found here .
You can ignore the server - side configuration ; you just need to add your public key on BitBucket 's account settings page and you should be set .
UPDATE : I did n't realize it before , but BitBucket has a guide to using SSH with BitBucket .
It 's definitely worth looking at .
Now you should be able to use hg push and hg pull on your local machine to push and pull changes to and from the BitBucket repository .
The next step is getting it set up on the server side .
On your server , use hg clone to clone the BitBucket repository to wherever you want to serve it from .
Edit the .hg / hgrc file in that one and change the default path to the same value as before :
default = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org /username/repositoryname/
Once again , set up public / private key authentication ; this time between the server and BitBucket .
You can either copy your public and private keys from your local machine to the server ( if you trust / own it ) or you can create a new pair and add its public key to your BitBucket account as well .
While you 're at it , set up public / private key authentication to go from your local machine to your server too .
It 'll pay off in the long run .
Now that you 've got both sides working , you can develop and deploy like so :
Make changes on your local machine , committing as you go .
Push the changes to BitBucket .
SSH into your server and pull the changes down .
Restart the web server process if necessary .
Not too bad !
Instead of manually managing file transfers you can let Mercurial do it for you .
It 'll only pull down the files that have changed , and will always put them in exactly the right spot .
That 's pretty convenient , but we can do better .
Being able to push and pull is all well and good , but that 's still a lot of typing .
You need to enter a command to push your changes , a command to SSH to the server , a command to change to the deploy directory , a command to pull the changes , and a command to restart the server process .
That 's five commands , which is four commands too many for me .
To automate the process , I use the wonderful Fabric tool .
If you have n't seen it before you should take a look .
To follow along with the rest of the section you should read the examples on the site and install Fabric on your local machine .
Here 's the fabfile I use for deploying my site to my host ( WebFaction ) .
It 's pretty specific to my needs but I 'm sure it will give you an idea of where to start .
def prod ( ) : " " " Set the target to production . " " " set ( fab_hosts = [ ' sjl.webfactional.com ' ] ) set ( fab_key_filename= '/ Users/sjl/.ssh/stevelosh ' ) set ( remote_app_dir= '~/webapps/stevelosh/stevelosh ' ) set ( remote_apache_dir= '~/webapps/stevelosh/apache2 ' ) def deploy ( ) : " " " Deploy the site . " " " require ( ' fab_hosts ' , provided_by = [ prod , ] ) local ( " hg push " ) run ( " cd $ ( remote_app_dir ) ; hg pull ; hg update " ) run ( " cd $ ( remote_app_dir ) ; python2.5 manage.py syncdb " ) run ( " $( remote_apache_dir ) /bin/stop ; sleep 1 ; $ ( remote_apache_dir ) /bin/start " ) def debugon ( ) : " " " Turn debug mode on for the production server . " " " require ( ' fab_hosts ' , provided_by = [ prod , ] ) run ( " cd $ ( remote_app_dir ) ; sed - i -e 's / DEBUG = .*/ DEBUG = True /' deploy.py " ) run ( " $( remote_apache_dir ) /bin/stop ; sleep 1 ; $ ( remote_apache_dir ) /bin/start " ) def debugoff ( ) : " " " Turn debug mode off for the production server . " " " require ( ' fab_hosts ' , provided_by = [ prod , ] ) run ( " cd $( remote_app_dir ) ; sed - i -e 's / DEBUG = .*/ DEBUG = False / ' deploy.py " ) run ( " $( remote_apache_dir ) /bin/stop ; sleep 1 ; $ ( remote_apache_dir ) /bin/start " )
When I 'm finished committing to my local repository and I want to deploy the site , I just use the command fab prod deploy on my local machine .
Fabric pushes my local repository to BitBucket , logs into the server ( with my public key — no typing in passwords ) , pulls down the new changes from BitBucket and restarts the server process .
I also set up a couple of debug commands so I can type fab prod debugon and fab prod debugoff to change the settings .
DEBUG option of my Django app .
Sometimes it 's useful to turn on debug to find out exactly why a page is breaking on the server .
The reason I split off the prod command is so I can set up a separate test app ( on the server ) in the future and reuse the deploy and debug commands .
All I 'd need to do is add a test command , which might look something like this :
def test ( ) : " " " Set the target to test . " " " set ( fab_hosts = [ ' sjl.webfactional.com ' ] ) set ( fab_key_filename= '/ Users/sjl/.ssh/stevelosh ' ) set ( remote_app_dir = '~/webapps/stevelosh-test/stevelosh ' ) set ( remote_apache_dir = '~/webapps/stevelosh-test/apache2 ' )
Deploying the test site would then be a simple fab test deploy command .
After you 've gotten all of this set up the first time it will start saving you time every time you deploy .
It also prevents stupid mistakes like FTP'ing your files to the wrong directory on the server .
It frees you from those headaches and lets you concentrate on the real work to be done instead of the busywork .
Plus setting it up again for a second project is a breeze after you 've done it once .
Obviously the exact details of this wo n't be a perfect fit for everyone .
Maybe you prefer using git and GitHub for version control .
I 'm sure there 's a similar way to automate the process on that side of the fence .
If you decide to write something about the details of that please let me know and I 'll link it here .
My hope is that this will at least give you some ideas about saving yourself some time .
If that helps you create better websites , I 'll be happy .
Please feel free to find me on Twitter with any questions or thoughts you have !
It 's been over a year since I originally wrote this entry and I 've learned quite a bit since then .
I do n't have the time right now to go back and rewrite the entire article , but here are some of the main things that have changed :
I now use virtualenv and pip when deploying Django sites .
It sandboxes each site very nicely and makes it easy to deploy .
I no longer go " through " BitBucket when deploying — I push directly from my local machine to the server .
This eliminates an extra step , and I can always push to BitBucket once I 'm done with a series of changes .
Fabric is completely different .
" Ownership / maintenance " of the project has transferred to a new person and the format of fabfiles has drastically changed .
Here 's a sample fabfile from one of the projects I 'm working on now .
There are no comments , but I think most things should be self - explanitory .
If you have any questions just find me on Twitter and I 'll be glad to answer them .
US Department of Energy Installing " Sun Wall "
January 12th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Chicago architecture firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz has produced the winning design for the US Department of Energy ’s Solar Wall competition .
SCB ’s sun wall will be 32,000 square feet and will cover the south elevation of the DOE ’s Washington DC headquarters .
As the largest building - integrated solar energy system on any US federal building , the sun wall will generate 200 kW of energy .
SCB ’s design also includes a solar thermal installation for hot water in addition to photovoltaic panels .
The DOE has n’t disclosed the project ’s cost , but I ’m betting that it will be relatively pricey .

-- add - field is also a new option to startmigration , which simplifies the common use case of adding one or more new fields as a migration .
Model inheritance and ManyToMany relationships are both now fully supported , and there 's a glut of database support with MySQL being fully matured and SQLite almost there .
Even SQL

For instance , a reputable company wo n’t use inferior materials , meaning you get what you pay for in the long run .
On the other hand , general contractors are more flexible and can take on just about any type of project .
For instance , they can handle the building process from start to finish , or they can complete smaller projects for those who prefer to work their own way .
Four interesting , yet separate filings were issued today regarding the Minnesota Senate Election Contest .
I will first cover the Coleman campaign 's reaffirmation of their intent to focus on potential voting anomalies :
TO : The Honorable Judges of the above - named Court , Al Franken , Contestee .
1 . As stated in Contestants ' Notice of Contest dated January 6 , 2009 , Contestant Cullen Sheehan believes and states that Contestants cannot properly prepare their case for trial without an inspection of Ballots and Election Materials relating to the office of United States Senate in the General Election , including , without limitation , all Ballots and Election Materials in the precincts described hereinabove .
2 . Contestant Cullen Sheehan therefore requests this Court to order such inspection pursuant to Minnesota Statutes § 209.06 and to implement procedures for appointment of inspectors on behalf of Contestants and Contestee pursuant to Minnesota Statutes § 209.06 .
3 . Contestant Cullen Sheehan further believes and states that Contestants cannot properly prepare their case for trial without a recount of the Ballots in certain precincts pursuant to Minnesota Statutes § 209.06 and therefore request this Court to order such recount relative to those precincts identified by Contestants .
4 . The precincts to be inspected and / or recount are as identified within Exhibit A through Exhibit E attached hereto .
Source : Verified Petition For Appointment of Inspectors via MNCourts.org [ PDF ]
The Coleman campaign is essentially asking the court to appoint inspectors with the power to examine whatever ballots the Coleman campaign wants to evaluate .
A brief summary of the Exhibits referenced above follows :
EXHIBIT A PRECINCTS WHERE DOUBLE COUNTING OCCURRED DUE TO DUPLICATE /ORIGINAL PROBLEM [ 214 ballots are listed in 38 precincts across 9 counties . ]
EXHIBIT B PRECINCTS WHERE BALLOTS WERE NOT COUNTED DURING THE RECOUNT DUE TO SECRETARY OF STATE INTERPRETATION OF RULE 9 [ 39 ballots are listed in 12 precincts across 6 counties . ]
EXHIBIT C PRECINCTS WITH MORE BALLOTS COUNTED THAN PERSONS VOTING ON ELECTION NIGHT ; CHAIN OF CUSTODY QUESTIONS [ 372 ballots are listed in 20 precincts across 11 counties . ]
EXHIBIT D COUNTIES / PRECINCTS WITH FEWER BALLOTS COUNTED THAN PERSONS VOTING ON ELECTION NIGHT [ 76 ballots are listed in 7 precincts across 6 counties . ]
EXHIBIT E PRECINCTS WITH OTHER IRREGULARITIES DURING THE RECOUNT [ 17 ballots are listed in 9 precincts across 5 counties . ]
Source : Affidavit of Matthew W Haapoja - Counsel for Contestants via MNCourts.org [ PDF ]
In total , the affidavit lists 718 ballots in 86 precincts across 21 counties .
Of these 718 ballots , 586 ballots ( as listed in Exhibit A and C ) correspond to the apparent discrepancy between the number of voters on Nov 4th and the final recounted total .
Recalling from our complete precinct data table , there appear to 1391 ballots that meet the specifications set forth by the Coleman campaign in regard to the aforementioned 586 ballots .
The increase in the number of anomalous votes presented by the Coleman campaign illustrates a potential realization within their campaign .
Based upon yesterday 's court hearing and the subsequent motions by Franken , it appears as though the Coleman campaign is building a safeguard against the possibility of the three judge panel ruling against their request to have rejected absentee ballots re-available for review as requested in Article 22 of the election contest and in Article 7 of affidavit filed by Matthew W Haapoja .
If we also recall Exhibit C from Coleman 's Election Contest and our corresponding article , it is highly probable that the ballots listed within Exhibit A and Exhibit C of this latest filing heavily favor Coleman .
If each request associated with these 586 ballots is granted , I believe Coleman would take the lead .
Coleman has specified an additional 460 anomalies , above and beyond the 126 first laid out within the election contest .
Based upon our simple extrapolation of the 126 original anomalies , Coleman should gain about 51 votes .
While I have not repeated the calculations for these additional 460 precincts , I think it is reasonable to assume that these ballots have a high likelihood of benefiting Coleman .
The scenario under which Coleman could take the lead represents an unbalanced scenario ; if Franken were to submit an equal number of ballots , the effect of Coleman 's additions would likely be negated based upon the composition of the 1391 ballots I have previously identified .
The table below illustrates the information presented within Exhibit B of the affidavit filed by Matthew W Haapoja :
[ The County , Precinct and Number of Ballots Potentially at Issue columns are listed within Exhibit B ; the Nov 4th Voters , Recount Total and Coleman Margin ( % ) columns have been appended using data from our PDF . ]
COUNTY / PRECINCT BALLOTS AT NOV 4TH RECOUNT COLEMAN ISSUE VOTERS TOTAL MARGIN % Anoka / Spring Lake Park 1A 3 895 892 - 3.13 Dakota / Burnsville P11 * 1 2016 2017 7.07 Dakota / Farmington P1 * 1 1016 1017 3.54 Dakota / Lakeville P10 11 2549 2538 30.3 Hennepin/Bloomington W4 - P6 * 9 1951 1950 - 3.79 Hennepin / Brooklyn Park WEP8 1 1898 1897 15.1 Hennepin / Edina P11 4 1845 1841 4.89 Hennepin / Maple Grove P6 3 2047 2044 24.4 Itasca / Comfort ** 1 601 600 18.3 Ramsey / Roseville P2 1 2423 2422 - 7.68 St Louis / Duluth P16 1 1531 1530 - 28.9 St Louis / Hermantown P3 3 1831 1828 - 8.81
* If the proposed corrections were to be made , the resulting total number of votes counted would exceed the number of voters recorded on election day .
** There is no " Comfort " precinct in Itasca .
There is a " Comfort " in Kanabec County ; the Kanabec data is used .
Within Exhibit B , the Coleman campaign is not only asserting that 39 ballots were erroneously ignored , but that twelve additional ballots , across three precincts , were cast above and beyond the number of voters present on election day .
The Coleman campaign has long argued that a discrepancy between the number of voters and the number of counted votes is reason for concern ; they appear to be suggesting that other votes were double counted in these three precincts .
The second filing comes not from the Coleman campaign , or the Franken campaign , but instead is an intervention from seven voters who received notification on January 8th , 2009 that their absentee ballots were not counted .
Within the eleven page document , their lawyers , Bruce D. Kennedy and Mark Priore , request that the courts intervene during the election contest to review these ballots ; they also request that any legal fees be reimbursed under the equal protection clause .
The first paragraph of their claim follows :
TO : The Honorable judges of the above - named Court , Norm Coleman , Contestant , Cullen Sheehan , Contestant ; and AI Franken , Contestee .
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that [ seven citizens ] desire to collectively intervene in this action pursuant to Minn .
R. Civ. P. 24.01 and 24.02 ; and that in the event of objection , they will move this Court for an order granting leave to intervene as a party in this action as soon as the parties may be heard .
In the absence of objection by an existing party to this action within 30 days after service of this notice on that party , such intervention shall be deemed to have been accomplished .
Source : Notice of Intervention via MNCourts.org [ PDF ]
It 's tough to determine the allegiance of these seven voters especially given the views put forth by Bruce D. Kennedy , their representation .
I find it probable that these seven voters do not represent a single constituency .
The third document presented to the election contest court centers on the issue of privacy protection ; the document is 75 pages .
The filing does n't appear to contain any election specific requests , but rather attempts to establish standards by which information should be cited and presented while upholding privacy and data practice laws .
The three judge panel will , in theory , present their ruling of Wednesday 's motion to dismiss , tomorrow ( Friday ) at 12:00 PM CT .
During the Friday hearing they will also hear Coleman 's version of the headshot , the Motion for Summary Judgment .
The entire request is literally presented below and essentially states that the court should just grant all of Coleman 's requests and declare Coleman the winner :
Petitioners respectfully request this Court grant judgment as a matter of law in their favor as follows : 1 . Directing that Petitioners ' absentee ballots shall be opened and counted immediately , and the total be declared and certified , for such use as might be appropriate by the United States Senate , this Court in the above - captioned matter , or any other proper use under law ; and 2 .
Granting Petitioners such other relief as the Court deems just and appropriate .
Source : Petitioners ' Amended Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment via MNCourts.org [ PDF ]
This request by Coleman has zero chance of success , or the same chance as Franken 's earlier motion for instant victory .
Like Franken , Coleman seems to be introducing other beneficial evidence , as described above , into the election contest through the Motion for Summary Judgment .
Update [ 9:09 AM CT ] :
The courts have denied Franken 's motion to dismiss the election contest ; this ruling was posted after midnight local time .
This is not a surprise .
The court cited two main items supporting their decision :
II .
Contestee AI Franken 's Motion to Dismiss Is Denied a .
The Court Is Vested with Jurisdiction to Hear an Election Contest i. Motion to Dismiss Legal Standard
ii .
The Court 's Exercise of Jurisdiction is Constitutional
iii .
The Court Has Jurisdiction Pursuant to Minnesota Statute § 209.12 . b. Contestants ' Notice of Contest Is Sufficient to Withstand a Motion to Dismiss The Court finds the Notice of Contest sufficiently Specifies the grounds on which the contest will be made pursuant to Minnesota Statute § 209.021 , subd .
1 , specifically referencing absentee ballots , missing ballots , and ballots that were counted twice .
Viewing the Notice of Contest in light of relevant case law and construing the facts alleged in the light most favorable to Contestants , the non-moving party , Northern States Power , 122 N.W.2d at 3D , the Court finds the Notice of Contest puts Contestee on notice of the grounds of the contest and affords him a fair opportunity to rebut the asserted claims .
See Greenly , 395 N.W.2d at 90 ; Christenson , 119 N.W.2d at 39 .
Therefore , the Court finds the pleading sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss .
Source : Order on Contestee 's Motion to Dismiss via MNCourts.org [ PDF ]
The court destroyed Franken 's claim , and they are likely to reach the same conclusion after hearing Norm 's similar , Motion for Summary Judgment later today .
Update [ 3:44 PM CT ] :
The MN Election Contest Court published another ruling from yesterday 's hearing regarding Coleman 's request to have both original and rejected absentee ballots deposited with the court .
The motion , by Coleman , was denied :
At the hearing on this matter on the morning of January 22,2009 , Contestants stated that their primary reasons for requesting an inspection under Minnesota Statute § 209.06 were to narrow the issues for trial and compare voter rolls to the number of votes cast in a precinct Contestants conceded that they would be able to prove their case without an inspection by calling election judges as witnesses , subpoenaing voter rolls , and subpoenaing ballots .
The parties already viewed the ballots during the recount process .
Given that the trial of this matter must begin on January 26,2009 , the Court is not convinced that another inspection of the ballots is efficient or needed to prepare for trial .

The Coleman campaign can still however subpoena this information ( or attempt to ) through the election contest process slated to begin next Monday , the 26th of January .
The Election Contest Court has not yet reached a decision regarding today 's Summary of Judgment Motion ; I will publish an analysis of their decision , when it becomes available .
I fear that a hatred for the government has clouded the minds of some of its critics .
Guido and the Devil ’s Kitchen are upset by the proposal in the Banking Bill to abolish the obligation upon the Bank of England to produce a weekly balance sheet .
This will , says DK “ abolish one of the major controls we have had over the Bank of England . ”
And the Telegraph quotes some Tory loon warbling about Weimar and Zimbabwe .
Their concerns are , I fear , exaggerated .
1 .
The idea that “ printing money ” is something sinister associated with banana republics is just gibber .
As Willem Buiter says , printing money is what all central banks do .2 . The Bank could n’t print money in secret even if it wanted .
Quantitative easing ( QE ) works by the Bank buying assets from commercial banks - and giving them money in exchange .
It must , therefore , announce its intentions to do so to banks , and therefore the rest of us .
3 .
There ’s little point doing QE in private .
The point of QE is to prevent severe deflation .
This is best done by raising inflation expectations , which in turn is best achieved by making as much of a song and dance about printing money as possible .
Indeed , in theory it ’s possible that the announcement of QE alone would be sufficient to raise inflation .
4 .
Even if there ’s no weekly balance sheet released , it ’s quite likely that the data contained in it will be released elsewhere , as it is now - for example , table B1.1.1 of Bankstats .
5 . The notion that the weekly data is a “ major control ” over the Bank is pish .
The current data show that the Bank ’s balance sheet has more than doubled in size since late September .
I ’d be happy to be corrected here , but I do n‘t recall this arousing critical comment and analysis from Guido and DK .
Well , this is pretty powerful stuff .
Last night , Keith Olberman 's " Special Comment " was about Prop 8 .
Also , Kevin Sessums over at the Daily Beast talks to Hollywood power players David Geffen , Darren Star , Dan Jinks , and others fuming about Prop. 8 , wishing they had done more .
Read Sessums article , right here .
In this tutorial , we 'll explain how to create an old paper , some fancy paper treatments and a feather pen .
These effects are all achieved with layer modes and gradients .
Let 's get started !
Final Image Preview
Below is the final design we will be working towards .

Step 1
Open up a new document and draw a rectangle with the Rectangle Tool ( M ) .
Leave the default settings of a white fill and a black stroke .
Step 2
Go to Effect > Distort & Envelope >
Roughen and choose the settings you see below .
This will be the frame work for our old paper .
Step 3
Fill the shapes with black , set the stroke to none and apply an Outer Glow of 100 % Opacity and a Blur of 7pt .
Set the Mode to Normal ( Effect > Stylize > Outer Glow ) .
Step 4
Create a duplicate of the black shape on top ( Command + C + F ) .
Choose a light brown or beige color and fill the shape and set the stroke to 1pt with the same color .
Then change
the Outer Glow settings via the Appearance Palette and set the Blur to 2pt .
Step 5
Duplicate the shape again on top ( Command + C + F ) and remove the Outer Glow settings .
Then go to Window > Swatch Libraries > Patterns > Basic Graphics > Basic Graphic_Textures .
Choose Stipple Fine and fill the shape .
This will replace the beige color .
Set the Layer Mode to Color Dodge , Opacity 79 % .
Then duplicate the shape again and change the Layer Mode to Overlay and set the Opacity to 10 % .
Replace the fill with Burlap from the texture palette .
This will give the paper a slight gritty look .
Step 6
Next , make again a duplicate on top and fill it with a linear gray , black , gray , to black gradient .
Set the Angle to - 50 .
Then change the Layer Mode to Overlay , 18 % Opacity and add an outer Glow , 100 % Opacity , normal mode and a Blur of 5 pt .
Duplicate the shape again on top , fill it with a radial gray to black gradient with the highlight towards the bottom right and set the Layer Mode to Overlay , 33 % .
Leave the Outer Glow Effect like it is .
Step 7
Duplicate the shape again , remove the Outer Glow and fill it with white .
Then set the Layer Mode to Soft Light , Opacity 45 % .
Make another duplicate , fill it with 80 % black and set the stroke to 3pt , 100 % black .
Set the Layer Mode to Overlay , 45 % Opacity .
This will bring out a burned effect .
Step 8
Voila , the old paper look .
We are almost there , we just need to add some fine touches .
Step 9
We will create a burned corner look for our paper .
Create a circle ( L ) and fill it with a gray to black radial gradient .
Set the gradient highlight towards the top left .
Step 10
Go to Effect > Distort & Envelop >
Roughen and apply the settings you see below .
Step 11
Place the shape on top of the paper layer and set the Layer Mode to Overlay at 100 % .
Step 12
Now since the shape is still too harsh and shows up on the background , we need to apply an Opacity Mask .
We have to do one important step first .
Since we want the shape to be
burned into the paper right to the edge , we will copy the original paper shape .
Just press Command + C. Then apply an Opacity Mask via the Transparency Palette .
Once you have activated the mask , paste the shape onto the artboard by pressing Command +
V . Cut away a good portion of it and just keep a corner piece that will fit .
Then apply a black to white radial gradient .
Voila , this way we can hide the burned shape and blend it better into the paper .
Step 13
Repeat Step 12 for the other corners .
I only added two more .
Step 14
Let 's move on to the paper treatments .
Create a rectangle and apply a Round Corner effect to it .
Then duplicate the rectangle and offset it .
Select both and apply the Divide option in the
Pathfinder Palette .
Step 15
Delete the shapes with the Direct Selection Tool ( A ) until you have a shape like you see in the image below .
Then select both end path points on the right and Average them both on the Axis .
Repeat the same with the bottom two .
Step 16
Next , open up the Flowers Palette ( Symbol Library ) and drag an instance of a flower of your choice onto the artboard .
Select it and expand its appearance .
Step 17
Make a copy of the line shape and the flower and select both and apply the Divide option from the Pathfinder Palette .
Step 18
Delete all the flower parts .
Left is the cut away line shape .
This might look like an unimportant step , but it will help a lot ( see next step ) .
Step 19
Select the vertical shape and apply the Envelop Distort option Flag to it .
Choose Vertical at 100 % .
Repeat the same with the horizontal one and choose Horizontal .
Then select the
curved lines and the flower and set the Layer Mode to Overlay .
Step 20
Let 's move on to the feather .
I outlined the shapes we need below .
You can go more into detail if you 'd like .
Create an ellipse ( L ) , remove the curves and add extra path points to make it look like a simple feather .
For the plume part , create a circle , apply the Roughen effect and scale it if you see fit .
Then apply a Pucker effect .
Expand the shape .
Then make a copy and add it to the feather shape via the Pathfinder Palette .
I chose some beige , white , and gray gradient for coloring .
Step 21
Move the feather shape and the shaft plus the plume part and arrange them over the paper layer .
I made the gradient slightly darker as well .
Step 22
Duplicate the feather shape on top and fill it with another darker gradient .
Move it slightly to the bottom left .
Do n't forget to place the extra copy of the plume part on top and fill it with a light radial gradient .
Step 23
Trace along the tip of the shaft and fill it with black .
Set the Layer Mode to Soft Light .
Then duplicate the shape on top .
This will make it look darker .
You could also try Overlay as a setting .
Step 24
To create a sense of depth , duplicate the feather shape with its shaft and choose Add to Shape Area in the Pathfinder Palette .
Place the shape underneath the feather and distort it slightly .
Set the Layer Mode to Normal and the Opacity to 60 % .
Then apply a Feather effect of 93pt .
Step 25
Now you are ready to add some text .
Outline the text and set the Layer Mode to Soft Light or Overlay depending on how you would like it to look .
Remember that a black color in Soft Light or Overlay mode will kind of burn itself into the shapes below .
Conclusion
I added a starburst and some ink drops .
Last but not least , place a darker background and you 're good to go .
Happy creating !
At the 1939 World ’s Fair , San Francisco Seals catcher Joe Sprinz tried to catch a baseball dropped from the Goodyear blimp 1,200 feet overhead .
Sprinz knew baseball but he had n’t studied physics — he lost five teeth and spent three months in the hospital with a fractured jaw .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - The U.S. general commanding NATO forces in Afghanistan has ordered a merger of the office that releases news with “ Psy Ops , ” which deals with propaganda , a move that goes against the alliance ’s policy , three officials said .
The move has worried Washington ’s European NATO allies -- Germany has already threatened to pull out of media operations in Afghanistan -- and the officials said it could undermine the credibility of information released to the public .
Seven years into the war against the Taliban , insurgent influence is spreading closer to the capital and Afghans are becoming increasingly disenchanted at the presence of some 65,000 foreign troops and the government of President Hamid Karzai .
Taliban militants , through their website , telephone text messages and frequent calls to reporters , are also gaining ground in the information war , analysts say .
U.S. General David McKiernan , the commander of 50,000 troops from more than 40 nations in NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , ordered the combination of the Public Affairs Office ( PAO ) , Information Operations and Psy Ops ( Psychological Operations ) from December 1 , said a NATO official with detailed knowledge of the move .
“ This will totally undermine the credibility of the information released to the press and the public , ” said the official , who declined to be named .
ISAF spokesman Brigadier General Richard Blanchette said McKiernan had issued a staff order to implement a command restructure from December 1 which was being reviewed by NATO headquarters in Brussels , but he declined to go into details of the reorganization .
“ This is very much an internal matter , ” he said .
“ This is up with higher headquarters right now and we ’re waiting to get the basic approval .
Once we have the approval we will be going into implementation . ”
But another ISAF official confirmed that the amalgamation of public affairs with Information Operations and Psy Ops was part of the planned command restructure .
This official , who also declined to be named , said the merger had caused considerable concern at higher levels within NATO which had challenged the order by the U.S. general .
“ DECEPTION ACTIVITIES ”
NATO policy recognizes there is an inherent clash of interests between its public affairs offices , whose job it is to issue press releases and answer media questions , and that of Information Operations and Psy Ops .
Information Operations advises on information designed to affect the will of the enemy , while Psy Ops includes so - called “ black operations , ” or outright deception .
While Public Affairs and Information Operations , PA and Info Ops in military jargon , “ are separate , but related functions , ” according to the official NATO policy document on public affairs , “ PA is not an Info Ops discipline . ”
The new combined ISAF department will come under the command of an American one - star general reporting directly to McKiernan , an arrangement that is also against NATO policy , the NATO official said .
“ While coordination is essential , the lines of authority will remain separate , the PA reporting directly to the commander .
This is to maintain credibility of PA and to avoid creating a media or public perception that PA activities are coordinated by , or are directed by , Info Ops , ” the NATO policy document says .
“ PA will have no role in planning or executing Info Ops , Psy Ops , or deception activities , ” it states .
The United States has 35,000 of the 65,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan , operating both under ISAF and a separate U.S. - led coalition operation , but both come under McKiernan ’s command .
Washington is already scheduled to send another 3,000 troops to arrive in the country in January and is now considering sending 20,000 more troops in the next 12 to 18 months , further tipping the numerical balance among ISAF forces .
“ What we are seeing is a gradual increase of American influence in all areas of the war , ” the NATO official said .
“ Seeking to gain total control of the information flow from the campaign is just part of that . ”
Posters with the slogan " There Is Probably No God " are to go up on buses in Genoa next month , where Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco 's family are from .
The cardinal is one of the Vatican 's toughest critics of atheists and gay rights campaigners .
Silvano Vergoli , of the Italian Humanist Organisation , told the Austrian Times : " We wanted to follow the example of the British Humanist Association .
We are in touch with them on a daily basis . "
The UK campaign sparked complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority from Christian Voice who claim the ads are misleading .
" The distress to his firms caused by the financial crisis and the related uncertainties of recent weeks , along with the helplessness of no longer being able to handle the situation , broke the passionate family businessman , and he ended his life , " the family said in a statement .

The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) is considering a green MetroCard program where riders can donate towards environmentally sustainable operations .
The idea is one of many made in a million dollar proposal on how the MTA could lessen the environmental impact of its operations .
This is not the first time the MTA has taken such measures under consideration .
They have confirmed that 7 - percent of their power be from renewables by 2015 , and they are also greening their facilities .
Ernest J. Tollerson , the authority ’s policy director , said that while still in the works , but that under the program riders buying tickets at station vending machines could be given a green option – pun intended .
“ We ’re working on a model , ” Mr. Tollerson said , “ that says that you might add an increment to the price of a MetroCard , a Long Island Rail Road ticket , to a Metro - North ticket and also to the crossings for bridges and tunnels , on a voluntary basis , and say that you might want to contribute a particular sum a month and that money would go into a program only to fund sustainability projects . ”
“ I think people may be willing to contribute something like the cost of maybe going to the movies one night to helping green the M.T.A. , ” he said .
Um , yah …especially if they keep making rubbish like that new Indiana Jones film .
Though , this greener choice comes on the heels of a fare increase .
Rates are expected to go up by 23 - percent .
The proposal also included that new construction should comply with LEED Silver guidelines .
Other choices are to make the subway cars lighter so they require less operational power .
How about just making them run on time ?

YEREVAN , Armenia ( AP ) —
Heavy fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the separatist region of Nagorno - Karabakh continued for a fourth straight day on Wednesday , in the biggest escalation of a decades - old conflict in years that has killed dozens and left scores of others wounded .
Azerbaijan 's Defense Ministry said Armenian forces started shelling the town of Tartar on Wednesday morning , damaging “ civilian infrastructure ” and wounding people , while Armenian military officials reported that Azerbaijani forces were bombing positions of the Nagorno - Karabakh army in the north of the war - torn region .
Armenian officials alleged that Turkish drones and F - 16 fighter jets were being used .
Turkey has denied supplying Azerbaijan with arms , and Azerbaijan said it did n't have any F - 16 jets .
The fighting in Nagorno - Karabakh erupted Sunday and has continued despite mounting calls for a cease - fire from around the globe .
Nagorno - Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by the Armenian government since 1994 at the end of a separatist war following the breakup of the Soviet Union three years earlier .
The region in the Caucasus Mountains of about 4,400 square kilometers ( 1,700 square miles ) , or about the size of the U.S. state of Delaware , is 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) from the Armenian border .
Soldiers backed by Armenia also occupy some Azerbaijani territory outside the region .
The conflict escalated on Tuesday , with Armenia alleging Turkish involvement and claiming that a Turkish F - 16 fighter jet shot down an SU - 25 from its air force in Armenian airspace , killing the pilot .
Turkey , which has been vocal about siding with Azerbaijan in the dispute , denied those claims , and so did Azerbaijan .
However , Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Wednesday that if Azerbaijan requests assistance , Ankara will provide it .
“ We have said that if Azerbaijan wants to solve this on the field , we will stand by Azerbaijan .
If Azerbaijan makes a request , we would do the necessary .
But we see that Azerbaijan has sufficient capacity , " Cavusoglu told the Anadolu news agency .
In the meantime , European officials are seeking to bring the opposing sides to the negotiating table .
French President Emmanuel Macron , speaking on Wednesday at a news conference in Riga , Latvia , called for talks between France , Russia and the United States — the three countries co-chair the Minsk group , set up in 1992 by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to resolve the conflict — to mediate .
“ I will speak to President ( Vladimir ) Putin tonight and , I think , President ( Donald ) Trump tomorrow to discuss and propose an exit strategy ” for the crisis , Marcon said .
The French president also condemned recent comments from Turkey as “ reckless and dangerous " and said he was " extremely preoccupied by the belligerent messages from Turkey in the past hours . ”

The announcement reflects GM ’s embrace of advanced battery technology as a core strategic competency .
As part of that strategic adoption of battery technology , Wagoner also announced that GM will open a new automotive battery lab — the largest of its kind — and a new partnership with the University of Michigan to create a new automotive advanced battery lab in Ann Arbor , Mich . , as well as a specialized curriculum within U - M ’s College of Engineering to develop automotive battery engineers .
As a manifestation of its rapidly developing advanced battery strategy , GM will establish its own lithium - ion battery pack manufacturing facility in the United States — the first such in the US solely operated by an automaker — to produce the 16 kWh Li-ion packs for the Chevrolet Volt extended - range electric vehicle .
GM selected LG Chem over A123Systems ( earlier post ) to supply the cells .
GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner made the announcement at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit .
Just over a year ago we began testing two different battery solutions for the Volt .
Since then , we have run prototype packs through countless tests , and our confidence in their ability to deliver the required power , range , safety and durability has grown dramatically .
In the process we have determined that the design , development , and production of advanced batteries must be a core competency for General Motors .
And we ’ve been rapidly building our own capability and resources to support this important strategic direction .
... Our announcements are part of a comprehensive advanced battery strategy for GM that is expanding along two primary pathways .
First , we ’re identifying core competencies — such as battery research , development and manufacturing — and integrating these fundamentals into our product development and manufacturing operations .
We believe over time this will become a competitive advantage for us in this important new technology .
Secondly , we ’re building a roster of battery suppliers and academic experts from around the globe , and leveraging their specialized abilities to develop battery chemistries and cell designs .
— Rick Wagoner
The plant .
The plant will initially use prismatic cells from LG Chem and manufacture modules and packs for the Volt .
The plant will be located in Michigan , subject to negotiations with state and local government authorities .
Preparation of the estimated $ 30 - million facility will begin in early 2009 , with production tooling to be installed mid-year and output starting in 2010 .
Michigan is providing a package of up to $ 517.5 million in tax credits designed to encourage the manufacture of plug - in traction batteries in the state .
( Earlier post . )
Compact Power Inc. , the North American subsidiary of LG Chem , will build packs for the Volt development vehicles ( there are now some three dozen Volt mules on the road ) until GM ’s battery facility is operational .
A joint engineering contract with Compact Power and LG Chem also has been signed to further expedite the development of the Volt ’s lithium - ion battery technology .
The plant may also in the future manufacture packs for use in other GM production electric - drive vehicles , said John Lauckner , GM ’s VP of Global Product Development .
Additionally , the knowledge gained from manufacturing the packs will be applied to requirements given to outsourcing partners , should GM decide not to manufacture packs itself for a certain vehicle line , said Denise Gray , Global Director Energy Storage Systems .
The cells .
The LG Chem cells use a proprietary lithium manganese spinel ( LiMn 2 O 4 ) material for the cathode with additives to improve calendar life under high temperature conditions ; an amorphous carbon anode ; a ceramic coating on the separator ( the safety - reinforced separator , SRS ) to minimize potential thermal runaway due to an internal short ; and a LiPF 6 electrolyte in organic solvents ( gel type ) .
The ceramic - coated SRS further enhances the significant abuse tolerance capability already provided by the manganese base in the LG Chem cells , thereby offering dual protection against thermal runaways that can result from abuse conditions such as internal shorts or extreme overcharge .
The laminated packaging is also thermally more efficient and safer than a metal cylinder .
GM thinks that A123Systems offers a “ great chemistry ” , said Tony Posawatz , Vehicle Line Director Chevrolet Volt .
However , he said , it was harder for them , since they were primarily manufacturing cylindrical format cells , to make the transfer to the prismatic format specified by GM .
GM says it will continue to grow and establish a robust lineup of battery suppliers for cell development and manufacturing with companies such as A123Systems and Hitachi Ltd. and battery integration expertise with companies such as Compact Power and Cobasys .
GM ’s approach to producing lithium - ion batteries is different than other major automakers , many of whom have entered into joint - venture deals with battery producers .
Toyota partners with Panasonic ( and now Sanyo ) in the PEVE joint venture ; Nissan formed a joint venture with NEC ( AESC ) ; Honda has just announced a joint - venture with GS Yuasa , which is also in a different joint venture with Mitsubishi ( Lithium Energy Japan ) ; and Daimler is forming a joint - venture with Evonik .
That approach can limit an automaker ’s options with new cells and chemistries , said Denise Gray .
GM wants to be able to take advantage of new possibilities on the cell side , while continuing to optimize its manufacturing techniques , much in the way that engine and powertrain optimization and manufacturing has progressed over the years .
The new GM battery lab .
The lab , which will open later this year , will be the largest automotive battery lab in the United States ( 31,000 square feet / 3,251 square meters ) and will be capable of testing new energy storage system technologies , as well as lithium -ion and nickel - metal hydride batteries , to accelerate the domestic development of advanced battery technology .
It will lead GM ’s network of existing labs in Honeoye Falls , N.Y. ; Warren , Mich . ; Torrance , Calif. ; and Mainz - Kastel , Germany .
GM will continue ramping - up in - house battery - development capability by increasing the staff of GM ’s global hybrid , electric vehicle and advanced battery organization to several hundred engineers in 2009 , including more than 200 currently dedicated to advanced battery technologies .
The University of Michigan partnership .
A five - year , $ 5 - million award establishes the GM / U - M Advanced Battery Coalition for Drivetrains ( ABCD ) , headquartered at U - M .
Three U - M engineering professors are involved , as is a faculty member at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs .
“ We need to flip the car parc . ” — Dr. Ann Marie Sastry , U-M
The mission of the ABCD is to accelerate the development of advanced batteries via experimentation and simulation to better understand and resolve issues related battery life and performance .
Our shared ambition is to see electrified drive trains in a large number of vehicle types and applications .
That means we need to reduce the design cycle in both time and cost .
Working with GM allows us to make an impact on large - scale production electric drive vehicles , and develop regularized , simulations - and knowledge - based methodologies for using batteries in drivetrains .
— Dr. Ann Marie Sastry , the Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Mechanical , Biomedical and Materials Science and Engineering at U - M , and U - M ’s co-director of the ABCD
To “ flip the car parc ” — i.e. , to replace combustion engines and mechanical drive with electrical drive on a large scale , suggested Dr. Sastry , “ we need strides in vehicle integration . ”
Dr. Sastry also heads Sakti3 , a U - M spinoff focused on next - generation lithium - ion battery technologies and processes .
Sakti3 intends to develop and commercialize an advanced manufacturing method for high - power batteries primarily for placement in electric vehicles .
The premise of this new manufacturing process is to produce batteries capable of withstanding the rigors of automotive usage .
Sakti3 is part of Khosla Ventures ’ battery portfolio .
( Earlier post . )
The ABCD is the latest in a series of collaborative efforts between the University and GM .
The auto manufacturer works closely with the College of Engineering in the Energy Systems Engineering master ’s degree program , now in its second year .
This program , which Sastry directs , aims to create the workforce necessary for a smooth transition to a time when automobiles and the electric grid interface on a regular basis .
Batteries are the most important part of the electric drivetrain , Sastry said , but they have n't been exhaustively studied in the automotive world because of their limited role in gas - powered vehicles .
This grant will allow Sastry and her colleagues to optimize batteries and predict how the batteries will behave over time .
As part of the Energy Systems Engineering program , students intern at GM .
Last summer , several worked on Volt research .
This semester , 50 GM engineers are enrolled as well , for a total of 75 students in the program .
Other collaborators in the new coalition are Wei Shyy , chair of the U - M Department of Aerospace Engineering and the Clarence L “ Kelly ” Johnson Collegiate Professor of Aerospace Engineering ; Wei Lu , associate professor in the U - M Department of Mechanical Engineering ; and Gregory Plett , associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs .
Other GM electric drive and infrastructure partnerships .
GM also collaborates with government organizations and industry consortia , such as the US Department of Energy ; United States Council for Automotive Research ; the United States Advanced Battery Consortium LLC ; and Electric Power Research Institute to advance the development of hybrids , plug-ins and electric vehicles , and related electric infrastructure to support those vehicles .
Drum Major Resigns After Suspension for Waving at Obama ( Photos )
, a firefighter and member of the Cleveland Firefighters Memorial Pipes and Drums was recently suspended for six months because he waved at Presidentduring the Inaugural Parade .
According to Pipe Major Mike Engle , " We have gone over and over time and again with everyone in the band that this was a military parade .
Protocol and proper decorum had to be followed at all times .
Unfortunately , John chose to ignore that .
Drum Major Coleman said when he looked over and saw that Obama was waving he just could not resist the urge .
He has handed in his resignation and said , " There are too many bridges burned with the pipe band , too many hurt feelings on both sides . "
Maybe if we all used friendly gestures more often our world would not be what it is today .
Kudos to the Cleveland firefighter for spreading goodwill , even if it did end up biting him in the butt .
You rock in our book John .
Ben and I are speaking at the Future of Web Apps in lovely Miami .
Having just been in the midwest , heading to some nice weather is welcome .
I spoke at the event in London and thoroughly enjoyed it .
At the time I was speaking on Gears .
This time , Ben and I are talking about the state of the Web , and it obviously excites us .
The timing is perfect as we give the talk on the back of the recent release of Bespin , the project that let us play with the bleeding edge .
We were unencumbered by the chains of old browsers , and it shocked us a little .
These chains keep us in the stone ages , and if we just suck it up and live with them the platform will pale in comparison to those that rev .
It is 2009 yet the majority of us still have to work in a world of browsers that were built for web pages .
This show is n’t called the Future of Web Pages though , is it !
Through innovative and tiresome work the community evolved what we finally coined Ajax .
It looked a little like this :
It was a series of hacks .
A series of quirks .
Painful .
But , just like the early planes , who cares ?
The beast does fly !
This cobbled together set of technologies gave us our flight in the form of giving us the ability to build applications .
The small changes that we got in XHR and the like meant that we could create interactive experiences on the Open Web .
But , the browsers are finally changing .
The new crop come with technologies that show that the browser vendors are thinking about building a platform for desktop quality applications .
The Chrome comic book was full of this .
We highlight some of these technologies :
Super fast JavaScript .
Other platforms have smart JIT VMs and we should be no different .
With the latest VMs that browsers are integrating we get orders of magnitude in performance gains .
This does n’t just make things a little faster , it means that the game has changed and you can do things that you previously could n’t

Fast JavaScript is great , but you still have a bottleneck in the old single threaded architecture of the browser .
Web Workers gives us a nice API ( no threading APIs here ! ) to offload the work .
As we think that we can do more ( due to the faster JS ) we find ourselves with more code , and we need to let the browser do its thing while this code runs .

Multiple processes .
Even with fast JavaScript and Web Workers , we need to isolate our worlds .
If you have Gmail , a calendar , Bespin , and three other real Web applications running , all polling for updates and the like , it is too easy to have them collide as they all ask the CPU to do work .
With the new multiprocess architectures we side step this issue .
When I am in Bespin I want it to have as much nice as possible .

Rich graphics .
We are used to having text , boxes , images to work with .
That ’s kinda it !
Is n’t it amazing to think about what we have done with those simple building blocks ?
With Canvas , SVG , and the great new CSS primitives ( border radius , css animations , css transitions , css shadows , and more ) we get to think outside of the box .

Desktop services .
We need to reach out .
Real applications need to talk to the clipboard , get geolocation , access your address book , etc .
We need to solve this problem to get past the cliff that we currently experience where people say “ but to do X , you need to use a native desktop framework ” .
We need a trust model that works , and to get the APIs into the browser .
What we end up with is this a metamorphosis from the first planes to the jet :
This is why I am excited to work on new developer tools for the Open Web .
I am jazzed that the community is making this happen .
Browser vendors , web developers , together we can make a big difference .
Of course , when the koolaid wears off I am always acutely aware of the problems that we have on the platform .
There is a long way to go , and we ca n’t just ignore old browsers .
Fun times ahead though !
H ow to explain Canada 's position on Gaza ?
This country used to tread a delicate diplomatic line between Israel and Palestine .
But today , both the governing Conservatives and opposition Liberals are hewing tightly to Israel .
The carnage in Gaza is both lopsided and graphic .
As the death toll among Palestinians rises , even neutral international bodies have become critical of Israel .
The UN suspended relief supplies to Gaza after Israeli troops allegedly shot and killed one of its aid drivers .
The International Committee of the Red Cross has broken its usual tactful silence to accuse Israel of breaching international humanitarian law .
Yet both the Conservatives , through their junior foreign minister Peter Kent , and the Liberals , through newly - annointed leader Michael Ignatieff , insist that Israel bears no responsibility , that its destruction of Gaza is a measured response to Hamas ' sporadic rocket attacks and that the Islamic organization is solely to blame .
For a country that once prided itself on its even - handed approach to the Middle East , Canada 's new position represents a curious shift .
The reasons are twofold .
The first has to do with 9/11 and the rethinking in many world capitals about organizations , like Hamas , that explicitly endorse terrorism .
In Canada 's case , this was heightened by the government 's desire to cleave to U.S. President George W. Bush .
The second reason , however , has to do with domestic politics and the succession of minority parliaments in Ottawa .
In a world where no single party can command a majority of MPs , individual ridings become even more significant .
And among some voters in some ridings , support for Israel is a make - or - break issue .
At one level , none of this new .
Identity politics predates Confederation .
The fact that Brampton produces Sikh politicians is not unrelated to the number of Sikhs living in that city .
In some parts of what used to be called Scotch Ontario , canny politicians still show up at events in their kilts .
Similarly , and for understandable reasons , many – if not most – Jews vigorously support Israel .
In ridings where there is a significant Jewish population , this matters .
Kent , for instance , may back Israel as a matter of deeply held principle .
But if he did not , this might well hurt him in Thornhill , a riding that he narrowly won last year and one in which the electorate , according to Statistics Canada , is about 36 per cent Jewish .
As for Ignatieff , he 's still trying to recover from his 2006 accusation that Israel 's bombing of Qana in Lebanon constituted a war crime .
Indeed , he was arguably correct .
But for a politician operating in an environment where one seat could make the difference between opposition and government , it was a dangerous remark .
Theoretically , identity politics should also work for pro-Palestinians , particularly in ridings containing significant numbers of Muslims .
But it does not .
In part , this is because Muslims tend to be new immigrants who have not yet mastered the techniques of Canadian ethnic politics .
In part , it is because those who hail from places outside the Middle East , such as South Asia , do not necessarily view Palestine as an existential issue .
For many Canadian Jews , however , Israel is literally a matter of life and death .
As long as enough hold this view , Israel 's welfare will be a defining issue in a handful of ridings .
And as long as Canada 's Parliament remains hung , no major political party will want to risk alienating this handful .

Thomas Walkom 's column appears Wednesday and Saturday .
Read more about :
GAZA , Jan 17 ( Reuters ) - Exhausted by lack of sleep , shattered by countless bombs and drained by bereavement , Gazans held out hope for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Saturday , if only for a chance to collect their lives .
" We do not care how , we want a ceasefire .
We want to go back to our homes .
Our children need to go back to sleep in their beds , " said Ali Hassan , 34 , a father of five who is sheltering in his brother 's house in the centre of Gaza .
" Enough is enough , " he said , explaining how he had moved his family from north Gaza to the centre of the city two weeks ago to escape Israeli bombardments in his neighbourhood .
" Our ears were about to blow up from the continued bombings .
We are even lucky to be alive still , " he said .
Despite stepped - up diplomacy and signs a ceasefire could soon be declared , Israel has sustained its three - week - old air , tank and artillery assault , seeking to deal a definitive blow to Hamas and its rockets before any truce takes hold .
In the face of the onslaught , which Palestinian doctors say has killed 1,200 Palestinians , including 410 children , Hamas has continued to fire rockets into Israel , albeit fewer than before , with seven launched on Saturday , according to the Israeli army .
Thirteen Israelis have been killed in the conflict , 10 soldiers and three civilians hit by rocket fire .
With several relatives killed , and little sign Hamas 's missiles were having a deep impact on Israel , Hassan suggested it was time for Israel to take the initiative and cease fire .
" A unilateral ceasefire from the side of Israel would be a blow to Hamas , a political defeat , " he said .
" Israel could claim they entered the heart of Gaza , destroyed the places , killed Seyyam and can come again any time , " he said , referring to Hamas security chief Saeed Seyyam , who died in an Israeli air strike on Thursday .
Others , though , were not convinced , saying Hamas should instead try to strike an open - ended ceasefire with Israel .
" That way they can claim it is not permanent and can break it once they have the ability to , " said Aziz , a taxi driver .
" Hamas has made a point .
Hamas has not been broken , they are continuing to fire rockets when they want and where they want .
But they need to think wisely of the gains and the losses . "
QUESTIONING HAMAS TACTICS
The gains and losses of Hamas 's policy are a major point of discussion among Gazans , many of whom instinctively support Palestinian resistance against Israel , but question the cost in lives and destruction of the past three weeks .
" Rockets must end .
What did we gain from them ? " said Lama , a secretary for a Gaza company , who would not give her full name .
" Now Hamas is negotiating a truce .
They were given an offer to renew it in December but they refused .
Now after thousands of casualties , how does Hamas explain that ? " she asked .
Hamas has fired around 8,000 rockets and mortars into Israel since 2001 , killing 21 people and causing widespread disruption in southern towns .
Israel has said stopping rockets is the chief objective of its offensive .
For Hamas , the ability to fire rockets up to 40 km ( 24 miles ) into Israel was a progression in tactics from the suicide attacks that were a hallmark of the early part of the second intifada ( uprising ) against Israel that began in 2000 .
But given the amount of death and destruction Israel has wrought on Hamas and Gaza as a result of the rockets , even those who initially backed the tactic are now questioning it .
" I have always been a supporter of rockets and all forms of resistance , " said Aziz , the taxi driver .
" But maybe Hamas needs to renew martyrdom operations instead , " he said , referring to suicide attacks .
Hassan , the father of five , said there was little point in firing rockets if they were not effective .
" Rockets -- I think this issue needs to be stopped for sometime and restudied , " he said .
" Once we have a missile that can reach the heart of Tel Aviv and blow up a building , maybe they can resume fire . "

“ Compared to physics , it seems fair to say that the quantitative success of the economic sciences is disappointing , ” begins Jean - Philippe Bouchaud , an econophysicist at Capital Fund Management in Paris .
That ’s something of an understatement given the current global financial crisis .
Economic sciences have a poor record of success , partly because they are hard ( Newton once pointed out that modelling the madness of people is more difficult than the motion of planets ) .
But also because economists have singularly failed to apply the basic process of science to their discipline .
By that I mean the careful collection and analysis of observable evidence which allows the development of hypotheses to explain how things work .
This is a process that has worked well for the physical sciences .
Physicists go to great lengths to break hypotheses and replace them with better models .
Economics ( and many other social sciences ) works back to front .
It is common to find economists collecting data to back up an hypothesis while ignoring data that contradicts it .
Bouchaud gives several examples .
The notion that a free market works with perfect efficiency is clearly untenable .
He says : “ Free markets are wild markets .
It is foolish to believe that the market can impose its own self - discipline . ”
And yet economists do believe that .
The Black - Scholes model for pricing options assumes that price changes have a Gaussian distribution .
In other words , the model and the economists who developed it , assume that the probability of extreme events is negligible .
We ’re all now able to reconsider that assumption at our leisure .
Bouchaud could also have added the example of economists ’ assumption that sustained and unlimited economic growth is possible on a planet with limited resources .
It ’s hard to imagine greater folly .
So what is to be done ?
Bouchaud suggests building better models with more realistic assumptions ; stronger regulation ; proper testing of financial products under extreme conditions ; and “ a complete change in the mindset of people working in economics ” .
All these things seem like good ideas .
But Bouchaud seems blind also to the greatest folly , which would be to imply that the roller coaster ride that we have seen in recent weeks can somehow be avoided in these kinds of complex systems .
Various physicists have shown that stock markets demonstrate the same kind of self - organised criticality as avalanches , earthquakes , population figures , fashions , forest fires … .
The list is endless .
And of course , nobody expects to be able to prevent the spread of bell bottoms or earthquakes or avalanches .
If you have forests , you ’re going to have forest fires .
What people do expect , however , is to have mitigation procedures in place for when these disasters do happen .
That ’s where econophysicists need to focus next .

IT WAS the evolutionary theory of its age .
A revolutionary hypothesis that undermined the cherished notion that we humans are somehow special , driving a deep wedge between science and religion .
The philosopher Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for espousing it ; Galileo Galilei , the most brilliant scientist of his age , was silenced .
But Nicolaus Copernicus ’s idea that Earth was just one of many planets orbiting the sun – and so occupied no exceptional position in the cosmos – has endured and become a foundation stone of our understanding of the universe .
Could it actually be wrong , though ?
At first glance , that question might seem heretical , or downright silly .
But as our cosmic horizons have expanded over the centuries so too has the scope of Copernicus ’s idea .
It has morphed into the Copernican , or cosmological , principle : that nothing distinguishes the position of Earth ’s galaxy from any other place in the entire universe .
And that idea , some cosmologists point out , has not been tested beyond all doubt – yet .
 Copernicus ’s principle has not been tested beyond doubt — yet 
That could be about to change .
A new generation of experiments might shore up the cosmic orthodoxy – or blow it out of the water .
That unexpected alternative , some people go so far as to say , might be no bad thing at all .
The modern - day Copernican principle amounts to two assumptions .
First , that averaged over large enough scales the universe is homogeneous , having essentially the same properties in all locations .
Second , that the universe is isotropic , or appears to have the same properties when viewed in any …

Here 's Mr. Bobby McPre -School
Teacher , everyone 's favorite marionette :
What a captivating speaking style !
Why , one might say he 's nearly ... human !
Word to the wise : Never follow Obama .
Apple 's final keynote presentation at Macworld is behind us , and some tech pundits are already calling it a ' snoozer ' and a ' disappointment ' .
Wall St. also did n't respond to favorably to Apple 's announcements , or lack thereof .
But all of these critics are missing the bigger picture .
The reason Apple has been so successful over the past few years is because it has adopted a strategy of releasing advanced and innovative products that it slowly but surely adds value to .
Ever since Apple introduced the iPhone at Macworld in 2007 , the hype and expectations surrounding every Apple event have grown to epic proportions .
Apple essentially became a victim of its own success , and as can be seen with the reaction to this keynote , pundits started criticizing Apple for what it did n't announce , while ignoring the products and advancements it actually did announce .
That said , Phil Schiller 's keynote presentation yesterday may not have included an iPhone Nano that can start your car and do your dishes , but there were still some interesting and important hardware and software updates that should n't be glossed over , and are n't as ' boring ' as people are making them out to be .
While everyone is rejoicing over a DRM free iTunes Store or debating the merits of an irreplaceable battery , an impressive number of improvements to Apple 's iLife software are flying under the radar .
i Photo '09 adds a number of new and exciting features such as geo-tagging , but the most eye - catching of them all is face recognition .
Once a user tags an individual in a photo , iPhoto '09 is able to analyze that person 's face , and subsequently tag all photos of that person automatically .
While not a new technology , Apple 's implementation of it adds a few new wrinkles , and more importantly , makes it more accessible to the masses .
Also noteworthy is Apple 's foray into the world of social networking with integrated support for both Flickr and Facebook .
Over 700 million photos are uploaded to Facebook each and every month , and the new iPhoto makes creating an album as simple as can be .
Users can now upload pictures to their Mac , select which ones they want , and create a Facebook album automatically , with tags and everything .
The overall improvements to iPhoto exemplify Apple 's attention to detail , and one example in particular is the way that iPhoto '09 handles slideshows - the new iPhoto uses ' face detection ' to ensure that photos used in slideshows are positioned so that the faces of the people in each picture are centered throughout the slideshow .
It 's also worth pointing out that Apple has further integrated its hardware and software by allowing users to create and download slideshows from iPhoto directly to their iPhone and iPod Touch .
If there 's a better way to show off your photo library while on the go , I have n't seen it .
Now are these improvements as revolutionary as the iPhone ?
Of course not , but they 're darn cool , and they 're a perfect example of how Apple creates incremental improvements to its product line that create more overall value in its products .
In a similar vein , iMovie '09 has a number of improvements that will hopefully make us forget about the travesty that was iMovie ' 08 .
The latest version of iMovie simplifies some otherwise complex editing tasks , while also introducing some professional level tools such as video stabilization .
Overall , it 's a solid upgrade , and hopefully an indication that iMovie is back on the right track after a brief detour .
As the keynote went on , Phil Schiller also introduced a new Macbook Pro with a significantly longer battery life , a DRM - free iTunes , and a significant update to iWork as well .
Okay , I 'll admit a new iWork is boring , but otherwise , this keynote was only disappointing for those who expect a new iPhone model every 8 months .
So while this was n't the most spectacular of Macworlds , it 's important to remember that the majority of Macworlds are n't - but that 's not really the point .
Apple does n't throw a knockout punch with every product it releases - no company does .
Rather , Apple throws a few jabs to set up a knockout like the iPhone , and the updates to iTunes , iWork , the Macbook Pro , and especially iPhoto and iMovie , were all jabs that hit the mark .

Windows 7 is shaping up to be an awesome OS .
It 's everything people wanted Vista to be and more .
Which is exactly why Microsoft should give it away — or offer it dirt cheap — to Vista users .

Windows 7 is the solution to Microsoft 's Vista problem , which is really a nasty hydra of a problem .
Let 's not pretend that this is n't the case .
There are three major heads to the beast : Consumer perception of Vista as an abysmal failure and a crappy OS ( hence , Mojave ) ; the use of XP instead of Vista in increasingly popular netbooks ; and the critical lack of Vista interest from the business community .
Windows 7 neatly resolves them : Word - of - mouth sentiment for Windows 7 has been overwhelmingly positive , even from Mossberg , a dude who spent half of his Sprint Instinct review pre-reviewing the iPhone 3G .
Windows 7 is slimmed down when it needs to be , running fantastically on netbooks .
And the IT buyers and consumers who skipped Vista have been waiting , cash in hand , for whatever came after , so Windows 7 will have a much more enthusiastic customer base .

The stars are aligned for Windows 7 .
It could wash the bad aftertaste from Vista out of everybody 's mouth .
But that 's only if Microsoft sells it right .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
For starters , Microsoft needs to get rid of all the separate license types ( OEM vs. upgrade vs. full ) and trim the number of boxed configurations .
Give buyers three versions , Home , Business and Ultimate , all at a reasonable price .
$ 129 would be ideal for the first two , with $ 149 for Ultimate .
Second , every Vista user should get it for $ 49 , or even less .
Apple gave away OS X 10.1 for free , and Microsoft should take a lesson there .
It does n't matter that Vista is n't really broken — like OS 10.0 really really was .
Or that it was mostly the hardware guys ' fault for not delivering their drivers on time .
Or that Mojave proves , at least to the nimwits who appear on camera , that Vista is a warm and fuzzy OS .
Or that , conversely , most people who hate Vista have never really used it .
All of that could be true , but regardless , people 's perception is that Vista was , is and always will be broken .
And perception is reality .

Microsoft screwed up the Vista launch , and well , first impressions are the ones that matter the most .
True , it 's already paying for that mistake .
But taking that small hit per user would n't just be the final cost of the Vista screwup , it would be " earnest money , " as they say in business .
Microsoft would be buying something it has n't had the opportunity to get in the last few years : People 's faith .
The worm can also spread via USB flash drives .
Experts are warning that hackers have yet to activate the payload of the Conficker virus .
The worm is spreading through low security networks , memory sticks , and PCs without current security updates .
The malicious program - also known as Downadup or Kido - was first discovered in October 2008 .
Although the spread of the worm appears to be levelling off , there are fears someone could easily take control of any and all of the 9.5 m infected PCs .
Speaking to the BBC , F - Secure 's chief research officer , Mikko Hypponen , said there was still a real risk to users .
" Total infections appear to be peaking .
That said , a full count is hard , because we also do n't know how many machines are being cleaned .
But we estimate there are still more than 9 m infected PCs world wide .
" It is scary thinking about how much control they [ a hacker ] could have over all these computers .
They would have access to millions of machines with full administrator rights .
" But they have n't done that yet , maybe they 're scared .
That 's good news .
But there is also the scenario that someone else figures out how to activate this worm .
That is a worrying prospect . "
Experts say users should have up - to - date anti-virus software and install Microsoft 's MS08 - 067 patch .
The patch is known as KB958644 .
Even having the Windows patch wo n't keep you safe
Graham Cluley
Sophos Speaking to the BBC , Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant with anti-virus firm Sophos , said the outbreak was of a scale they had not seen for some time .
" Microsoft did a good job of updating people 's home computers , but the virus continues to infect business who have ignored the patch update .
" A shortage of IT staff during the holiday break did n't help and rolling out a patch over a large number of computers is n't easy .
" What 's more , if your users are using weak passwords - 12345 , QWERTY , etc - then the virus can crack them in short order , " he added .
" But as the virus can be spread with USB memory sticks , even having the Windows patch wo n't keep you safe .
You need anti-virus software for that . "
Method According to Microsoft , the worm works by searching for a Windows executable file called " services.exe " and then becomes part of that code .
It then copies itself into the Windows system folder as a random file of a type known as a " dll " .
It gives itself a 5 - 8 character name , such as piftoc.dll , and then modifies the Registry , which lists key Windows settings , to run the infected dll file as a service .
Once the worm is up and running , it creates an HTTP server , resets a machine 's System Restore point ( making it far harder to recover the infected system ) and then downloads files from the hacker 's web site .
Most malware uses one of a handful of sites to download files from , making them fairly easy to locate , target , and shut down .
But Conficker does things differently .
Right now , we 're seeing hundreds of thousands of [ infected ] unique IP addresses
Toni Koivunen , F - Secure Anti-virus firm F - Secure says that the worm uses a complicated algorithm to generate hundreds of different domain names every day , such as mphtfrxs.net , imctaef.cc , and hcweu.org .
Only one of these will actually be the site used to download the hackers ' files .
On the face of it , tracing this one site is almost impossible .
Variant Speaking to the BBC , Kaspersky Lab's security analyst Eddy Willems said that a new strain of the worm was complicating matters .
" There was a new variant released less than two weeks ago and that 's the one causing most of the problems , " said Mr Willems " The replication methods are quite good .
It 's using multiple mechanisms , including USB sticks , so if someone got an infection from one company and then takes his USB stick to another firm , it could infect that network too .
It also downloads lots of content and creating new variants though this mechanism .
" Of course , the real problem is that people have n't patched their software , " he added .
Microsoft says that the malware has infected computers in many different parts of the world , with machines in China , Brazil , Russia , and India having the highest number of victims .
