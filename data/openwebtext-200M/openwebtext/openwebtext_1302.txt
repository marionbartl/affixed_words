CNN headline : Karzai calls for unity , end to corruption in Afghanistan
It is astounding to see the western media treat Karzai like a legitimate winner and someone who has any credibility to fight corruption .
This is akin to how the Soviet media treated the election “ victories ” of Stalin ’s puppets in East Europe .
At least we now have a better understanding of how Hillary Clinton , Obama , and the establishment media define political legitimacy .
If you ’d like to hear a boring but heart - warming story , ask a geek about how they learned programming .
It ’s like the opposite of trolling : you can instantly provoke tearfully - joyous nostalgia out of programmer strangers on the Internet by making this inquiry .
Most of these stories will include some form of a programming language called BASIC , the Beginners All - purpose Symbolic Instruction Code created in the 1960 ’s at Dartmouth .
The Atari generation has now grown up , and so have programming languages .
But I think this nostalgia is responsible for us holding onto an out - dated language like a ratty security blanket .
In another post , I wrote about how Python is the new BASIC , as in it should take up the mantle of being the iconic first programming language for kids to learn .
The rising sun of Python should be a long - awaited welcome for a new generation of coders .
In the early 2000 ’s , there seemed to be ( at least from my perspective ) a noticeable gap in kid-accessible programming that was filled with JavaScript , TI - 82 calculator programming , and Visual Basic .
These were languages suited for the world of software engineers , but it was hardly ideal for the kid software hobbyist .
Two articles that pointed this out was David Brin ’s Salon.com post , “ Why Johnny Can’t Code ” and _why the lucky stiff ’s article , “ The Little Coder ’s Predicament . ”
Both lamented the waning of a simple , approachable language and coding environment that was universally known .
why responded with an interactive Ruby tutorial Hackety Hack .
But David Brin ’s solution was several steps backwards .
A couple of decades backwards .
David Brin concludes his article ( written in 2006 ) by buying his son a Commodore 64 ( the kind of computer that programmers get nostalgic for ) and beseeching Microsoft and other major companies to release a version of BASIC with their products .
This leads me to say one thing :
Just let BASIC die .
I have those warm fuzzy memories of making simple text RPGs and hacking around with NIBBLES .
BAS .
I can tell you stories of how much fun I had making my own programs in BASIC .
When I was a child , I typed like a child , I coded like a child , I Hello World ’d like a child .
But when I became a man , I put away that childish language .
And with the modern languages we have now , there ’s no reason for the next generation to take it up .
We were blissfully ignorant about the headaches and inconveniences that BASIC brought us .
I ’m not just talking about “ GOTO Considered Harmful ” .
We forget about the warts of “ End If ” and “ DATA and READ ” and “ int ( rnd ( 1 ) * 10 + 2 ) ” ( and do n’t forget to first put in “ randomize timer ” ) .
But these are mistakes that have long since been corrected by other languages .
But we keep trying to revive this dead horse .
There is Small Basic , Basic - 256 , ( formerly KidBASIC ) , Run BASIC , et cetera et cetera .
Each of these has almost no community compared to other mainstream languages .
Each has their own custom APIs that they ’ve kludged onto the original language ( which means very shallow amounts of documentation . )
And without popular adoption they are at risk of being dropped when their core developers find something new to work on .
The answer to why ’s Little Coder Predicament is going to need several things .
The language has to be easy to learn .
But it also has to be powerful , and not restrained by the “ 4 kidz ” style that many game creation kits have .
It needs to be freely available .
It needs to have language maturity , written by people who understand programming language design .
It needs to be portable across several platforms so kids can share their programs with friends .
It needs a REPL ( i.e. the interactive shell . )
It needs to have a large number of third party libraries developed for the language that can extend its capabilities .
It needs large amounts of reference documentation and tutorials .
You need to be able to go to Barnes and Nobles or the public library and find a real , dead - trees book that covers the language .
Python with Pygame provides much more powerful ways to do programming than BASIC but with the same gentle learning curve .
Displaying sprites from image files , scaling them , and rotating them can be done in one line .
Playing MIDI , WAV , and MP3 files is the same .
You can easily incorporate the mouse ( and , unlike Small Basic , use the scroll wheel ) .
You can display text in any font you can load .
Colors and transparency and drawing primitives are all dead simple .
BASIC ’s time has long since past , and it would be completely dead if not for the misguided attempts of now - grown programmers who misremember a past golden hey - day .
Another thing programmers love do to besides reminisce about the simpler days of BASIC and banana - throwing gorillas is write code .
New code .
Writing new code is easier than reading up on mature , already - adopted standards .
Forging your own path has the excitement of crafting something original yourself , without all the hang ups of abiding and being restrained by past conventions ( and , I would add , wisdom ) .
Nostalgia and wheel - reinvention are the two seductive forces I blame for this Weekend At Bernie ’s - style jaunt we play with BASIC .
I wanted to contribute to the next generation of coders , so I wrote “ Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python ” ( available for free under a Creative Commons license at http://inventwithpython.com ) .
During the course of writing the book , I had to code up several games that the reader could copy .
I found that writing these game programs in Python was far easier and in fewer lines than anything I had done in QBasic .
I did n’t need to know about the advanced features of the language before I started ( which is Java ’s hangup ) and I could be sure that the code I downloaded from others would run without modification ( which is C++ and BASIC ’s hangup . )
I ’d rather produce a useful addendum rather than an original flop .
BASIC leaves us standing on the shoulders of Shetland ponies .
As rich as Python ’s community is , there was a need for a simple , expansive tutorial that taught programming through the practical ( and fun ) means of creating video games .
So I wrote Invent with Python .
I loved coding games as a kid , and kids love doing it now .
Playing games that you ’ve created yourself is timeless .
But BASIC is not .
Just let BASIC die .
Netbooks are likely to be a popular gift this holiday season — they 're cheap , highly portable , and the kind of thing that you can give as a gift to a relatively novice computer user who needs a laptop but does n't need the power or responsibility that comes with a more expensive portable .
Netbooks are also looking increasingly good to business travelers , due to their portability and low hardware replacement cost in case of loss , damage , or theft .
But even though a netbook itself can be cheap to replace , losing an inexpensive netbook PC can still be very costly .
Sure , a stolen or lost netbook will set you back a few hundred dollars for the device , but you have to consider how much the data stored on it is worth .
That lost netbook can open you up to identity theft , empty out your bank accounts , or even cost you your job .
That 's something to think about before you walk out the door with that $ 300 wonder .
However , with a little bit of planning , a little bit of effort , and perhaps some additional software , you can ensure that if you lose your netbook , whoever finds it has nothing more than a useless , two - pound hunk of plastic and silicon .
Not only can you protect and encrypt your data from prying eyes , you can also set your netbook to self - destruct all the data onboard if you lose it .
In this article , we 'll give you a basic introduction to securing your Windows netbook in case it 's stolen .
Advanced Windows users will already know most of what we 'll cover , so this article is aimed more at the user who has a new netbook and no idea how to secure it .
The basics
The first , perhaps most obvious step to protecting your data lies in making sure that your user account is password - protected .
Both Windows XP and Windows 7 can create user accounts and add passwords quite easily , although both have a slightly different process for doing so .
It seems that when most people set up their netbooks , they go along with the default settings and skip creating a user account .
Creating a user account and password is a critical first step to protecting your netbook — that information is usually a prerequisite for more advanced security products .
Just remember , user accounts and passwords are only a first step towards securing your data and can sometimes be bypassed if not configured properly .
Adding an account and password on a Windows XP machine is a straightforward process , and that process is quite similar on other version of Windows ( Including Vista and Windows 7 ) .
First , you will need to launch the control panel application to access the User Accounts application :
From Control Panel , you choose the User Accounts application .
Here you can check and see that you have a user account set up and you can make sure that no other accounts are enabled or configured .
If there are other accounts , it is critical to make sure that they all have passwords :
To create a password for an existing account , you click on the change account icon , which launches the account maintenance application ; from there you can create a password for the account :
When you create your password , make sure it is at least 8 characters and contains letters , numbers and even some special characters :
If you have the option to ' make your files private ' , do so for an extra layer of security on your netbook :

AHMEDABAD : The trouble with the computer - aided CAT exam was diagnosed as ‘ Conflicer ’ and ‘ W32 Nimda ’ , the two viruses that attacked the system display of the test , causing it to slow it down .
Efforts are now on to quarantine the systems from these viruses to ensure smooth conduct in the remaining days .
Tests at 47 labs were called off on the first two days and 33 labs on Monday , on account of this problem affecting nearly 8,000 aspirants who will be rescheduled .
Samir Barua , director of IIM - A , which is the nodal agency for conducting CAT in the country , told reporters , " Though there were precautions taken , with so much of technology involved , it is hard to keep the system foolproof .
The 47 centres which reported problems on Day one , were kept shut on Day 2 so that they could be checked .
On Day 3 , 33 were shut , which include some new centres also , " said Barua .
" All efforts are right now diverted to further isolate and quarantine the individual servers , increase virus protection and control accessibility so that the test can be conducted smoothly on the remaining days .
These security measures are being taken not only in the centres that have experienced problems but all the others that were operating smoothly , " added Barua .
Charles Karnan , COO , Prometric , the US agency given the contract for CAT 2009 along with NIIT , said , " All the students who have suffered any difficulty in the taking the test will be accommodated , as all the centres were asked to keep a buffer in case of any such problem , right in the beginning .
Of the 8,000 odd candidates that have faced problem , 62 % have been rescheduled . "
" This is the biggest test we have conducted .
Usually these many students take tests like GRE , GMAT or Toefl across the year , but here we had to complete the process in 10 days , " he said .
Students facing problems at individual levels , have been asked to report to the Candidates Care Service at each centre .
“ Once their credentials are confirmed , they will be given a new test date and slot when they can appear for the test , " Satish Deodhar , convenor of CAT Centre said .
Asked how the three centres at Ahmedabad were glitch - free , Prof Deodhar , said , " The centres here were able to keep their servers quarantined better . "
A dog was tied to a car and then dragged three miles to its death early this morning at the Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction .
“ This was an incredible act of cruelty done to a defenseless animal , ” Joan Anzelmo , superintendent of the monument told The Denver Post .
“ It is a sickening , sickening type of crime .
We are leaving no stone unturned . ”
Anzelmo said tonight that , thanks to tips , authorities have focused in a specific suspect and hoped to have him in custody soon .
She said that , based on information they have received , officials believe the dog had been stolen .
Anzelmo said tracks left in the snow clearly show how the crime was committed :
The dog initially walked , then ran and then was dragged when it could n’t keep up with the vehicle .
It was finally dumped after it died from the dragging .
She said the German shepherd - blue heeler mix was forced to run up one of the steepest hills at the monument .
During the three miles , the dog had to run on about two inches of snow , around multiple switchbacks and sharp curves and gained more than 1,000 feet in elevation before he collapsed and died .
The dog appeared to have been in good condition prior to the incident , with a thick coat of fur , she said .
The animal was neutered and showed no signs of previous abuse .
The dog was found by the chief of maintenance of the monument about 4:30 a.m. today , with a silver and blue synthetic rope around its neck .
Anzelmo said the employee was very upset .
The superintendent said there is quite a bit of evidence , including the tire tracks of the vehicle .
She also said that it is believed that people in the area with “ sharp eyes ” may have seen the vehicle involved .
Investigators think the incident occurred between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m .
A veterinary pathologist from Colorado State University will perform a necropsy on the dog .
“ We are pursing all manner of evidence , ” said Anzelmo , who added that she was optimistic the culprits would be arrested .
She said there is no chance the dragging was unintentional .

Is it really true that if you do n’t play to your “ base ” ( the most extreme elements of your supporters ) that you ca n’t make anyone happy ?

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned on Monday that climate change posed a “ catastrophic ” threat in some of the sharpest comments yet on a subject the Kremlin has often seemed reluctant to confront .
Although the United States said that the consensus amongst the 19 leaders at the weekend Asia Pacific summit in Singapore was that a climate change deal this December was unlikely , Medvedev made clear he felt it was a top priority .
“ If we do n’t take joint action , the consequences for the planet may be very distressing to the point that the Arctic and Antarctic ice can melt and change ocean levels , ” he said shortly before leaving Singapore .
“ All of this will have catastrophic consequences . ”
Russia signed up the Kyoto protocol after years of haggling about its implementation , but has been criticized by environmental groups for not offering more ambitious emissions cuts ahead of December ’s Copenhagen summit .
In the past , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had appeared to shrug off the threat from climate change , joking that Russians would welcome warmer weather and would need to buy fewer fur coats .
Some prominent Russian scientists argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon .
La Russa : l'quell ' uomo ha evitato il linciaggio .
Setto nasale rotto , ne avrà per 20 giorni
Premier colpito al viso dopo il comizio
« Sto bene , sto bene » .
Ma resta in ospedale
Centrato con una statuetta souvenir mentre incontra i suoi fan .
L'aggressore è un uomo con problemi mentali
Berlusconi sanguinante lascia piazza Duomo MILANO - Silvio Berlusconi è stato colpito al viso da un uomo che teneva tra le mani una statuetta subito dopo il suo comizio in piazza Duomo , a Milano , in occasione della cerimonia di avvio del tesseramento al Pdl .
Il premier è stato raggiunto al volto da una statuetta usata come oggetto contundente attorno alle 18,20 , mentre si attardava nel salutare i fan che lo avevano raggiunto alla base del palco .
Tra questi si era però infiltrato anche un individuo che , arrivato fino a ridosso del luogo in cui era parcheggiata l'auto del presidente del consiglio , è riuscito ad eludere la sorveglianza e a mettere in atto il suo proposito .
Già durante il comizio Berlusconi era stato contestato da un gruppo di persone che si trovavano sul lato destro del palco ( GUARDA ) .
L'autore dell ' aggressione non faceva tuttavia parte di quel gruppo e da quanto è stato possibile accertare ha agito da solo .
L'ARRESTO - Berlusconi ha subito accusato il colpo , si è accasciato con il labbro sanguinante ed è stato fatto sedere all ' interno dell ' automobile dagli uomini della sua scorta , mentre altri agenti di polizia riuscivano a fermare l'autore dell ' aggressione e a sottrarlo alla folla che avrebbe voluto linciarlo .
L'oggetto sferrato contro il premier sarebbe una riproduzione in miniatura del Duomo , di quelle vendute in tutti i negozietti di souvenir presenti in diversi punti della piazza .
Una prima ricostruzione dell ' accaduto l'ha fatta Doriano Riparbelli , responsabile organizzativo del coordinamento regionale del Pdl : « Un simpatizzante ha chiesto a Berlusconi di poterlo fotografare , poi ha tirato fuori il portafogli per dargli il biglietto da visita - ha riferito Riparbelli -. Berlusconi si è spostato per stringere la mano di altri simpatizzanti e a quel punto il contestatore lo ha colpito con una statuetta » .
Secondo il coordinatore regionale del partito , il premier « ha fatto come se stesse per svenire , poi si è tirato su , lo ha guardato negli occhi , è risalito in macchina , ha cercato di uscire dall ' auto per parlare al contestatore e chiedergli la ragione del gesto .
A quel punto la scorta ha trattenuto Berlusconi dall ' uscire , è stato soccorso subito dal suo medico personale ed è stato portato al San Raffaele » .
« SALVATO DAL LINCIAGGIO » -
Un testimone , interpellato da SkyTg24 , ha raccontato che la persona che ha aggredito il capo del Pdl « non sembrava normale » .
« L'aggressore - ha poi spiegato Ignazio La Russa che si trovava vicino al capo del governo - l'abbiamo preso immediatamente , grazie alla polizia che l'ha letteralmente sottratto al linciaggio della folla .
Se non ci fossero stati loro ne sarebbero rimasti soltanto pezzetti » .
L'uomo si chiama Massimo Tartaglia , classe 1967 , residente nell ' hinterland milanese , e non risulta avere precedenti penali .
Per lui è stato formalizzato l'arresto con l'accusa di lesioni personali aggravate dalla qualità della persona offesa e dalla premeditazione perché in tasca gli è stata trovata anche una bomboletta di spray al peperoncino .
Secondo quanto riferito dalla Digos , non risulterebbe associato a movimenti antagonisti .
Risulta invece che da dieci anni è in cura al Policlinico di Milano per disturbi mentali .
In Rete sono subito comparsi gruppi che inneggiano a lui per il gesto compiuto : « Santo subito » , « Sposami » sono alcuni degli incitamenti apparsi su Facebook .
Intanto il padre dell ' uomo , Alessandro Tartaglia , raggiunto dai cronisti nell ' abitazione di Cesano Boscone ha spiegato : « Votiamo Pd , ma non abbiamo mai incitato all ' odio verso il premier .
Se avessimo immaginato cosa voleva fare Massimo , lo avremmo fermato » .
IL RICOVERO - Berlusconi ha iniziato a sanguinare copiosamente dal labbro .
E ' stato trasportato all 'ospedale San Raffaele , alla periferia est della città , vicino agli studi Mediaset , per essere visitato e medicato , ma prima di ripartire dalla piazza ha voluto mostrarsi nuovamente ai suoi sostenitori nel tentativo di rassicurarli sulle sue condizioni .
Il primo bollettino dell ' ospedale parlava di perdita copiosa di sangue con lesione lacero - contusa interna ed esterna e due denti lesi , di cui uno superiore fratturato .
Il primario del reparto di anestesia e rianimazione , Alberto Zangrillo , medico di fiducia del premier che si trovava in piazza al momento dell ' aggressione , ha poi spiegato che la prognosi è di 20 giorni in quanto la tac ha evidenziato anche una frattura del setto nasale , oltre ad una ferita lacero - contusa che ha richiesto punti di sutura al labbro inferiore .
« È molto scosso , abbattuto e dispiaciuto » , ha detto il primario .
Al termine degli accertamenti medici , Berlusconi ha ricevuto una telefonata dal capo dello Stato , Giorgio Napolitano , che ha voluto esprimergli personalmente la sua solidarietà .
« NON MI FERMERANNO » - « Sto bene , sto bene » ha detto Silvio Berlusconi mentre veniva portato fuori dal pronto soccorso del San Raffaele per essere trasferito in una stanza di ospedale .
Il premier è stato trasferito in corsia steso in barella , in maniche di camicia , con una borsa del ghiaccio sul volto .
Mentre veniva portato fuori dal pronto soccorso ha stretto la mano a uno del suo staff , che lo ha raggiunto in ospedale ed è a lui che ha precisato di sentirsi bene .
Poi il premier ha ricevuto la visita di diversi amici e esponenti politici e a loro ha detto di essere « amareggiato » per « questa campagna di odio » .
« Questo - ha spiegato - è il frutto di chi ha voluto seminare zizzania .
Quasi me l'aspettavo ... » .
Berlusconi , che ha chiesto invano ai medici di dimetterlo subito e di permettergli di tornare nella residenza di Arcore , a tutti ha ripetuto di essere stato nei giorni scorsi nel mirino di una campagna di veleni .
« Tutti dovrebbero capire che non è possibile oltraggiare un presidente del Consiglio , questa è la difesa delle istituzioni » .
Al di là dell ' amarezza , il Cavaliere ha sottolineato di non voler minimamente farsi impressionare dall 'episodio .
« Sono ancora qui e non mi fermeranno » .

It seemed like a good idea , but what happens when you can't contact the server to confirm you can open the document you protected ?
DRM - digital rights management - is usually criticised because the " rights " that get conferred are those you 'd expect on an analogue product , but which are somehow withheld to be endowed by whoever is in charge of the DRM .
( Such as Apple 's " Fairplay " system , which will limit the number of computers that a digital product can be played on . )
Sometimes though it's the " management " bit which gets messed up .
Such as happened with the owners of Office 2003 documents who found , after enabling protection of the documents using Microsoft 's Rights Management System ( RMS ) , that nobody could open them .
Including the creator .
The reason ?
According to an embarrassed Microsoft blog post , because a certificate had expired .
Which meant of course that the server did n't like any request made to it to access the document .
Though there 's now a hotfix for Office , Word Viewer and Excel Viewer ( not apparently Powerpoint Viewer - is there one ? - or Outlook ? ) .
But it 's still something that should n't have happened .
Now put yourself in the place of the people who listened to the Microsoft salespeople in 2002 or so when they were extolling the virtues of RMS .
" And it 's online , so you can enable just who you like to read the document , wherever they are in the world ! "
Sounds great ; in practice , liable to central failure like this .
In its way , this is very similar to the experience of people who 've signed up for server - based DRM .
Cory Doctorow has warned about this in the past : as he puts it , " Do n't fall for the Potemkin scam " .
Given that that piece was written in 2007 , it 's worth revisiting , because its fundamental truth remains :
The DRM business model is the urinary tract infection of media experiences : all of the uses that used to come in an easy gush now come in a mingy , painful dribble - a few pennies out of your pocket every time you want to watch a show again , hit the pause button , or rewind .
Or of course open those documents .
And ask yourself : if you had been bitten by this bug , would you have hurried to upgrade ?
Knowing that the bug exists , do you want to use that DRM ?

This an open discussion of a Pinochet moment for Nepal — which would not just be a military coup but also the creation of a death squad regime aimed at the decade - old Maoist revolutionary upsurge .
Such a coup would require Indian and U.S. support — and this article is an ominous “ trial balloon . ”
Readers outside Nepal , and especially in the U.S. , should take this as a warning and a call — to step up our work , to spread knowledge of this revolution , and accelerate work to create a voice against U.S. intervention .
This article was published on My Republica on December 20 , 2009 .
Getting Out Of The Quagmire
by Sukhdev Shah
Sukhdev Shah was Nepal ’s ambassador to the U.S. from February to May 2009 , when the Maoist - led government fell .
( We apologize for stating that he is the current ambassador when we first posted this article . )
Shah worked for the International Monetary Fund for two decades and is a U.S. citizen .
As things have evolved over the past three years , Nepal has become a fertile ground for a military takeover of the government , independently or under the shadow of a constitutional authority .
Such a possibility has been talked about in a limited circle but been forced open by a delegation of some Nepali Congress ( NC ) leaders who recently urged President Ram Baran Yadav to consider imposing President ’s Rule to help restore peace and enable the Constituent Assembly ( CA ) to complete writing the constitution before the expiry of deadline in five months .
This is not an incredible or inappropriate suggestion , considering the marathon obstructions staged by Maoists to prevent the CA to open for business and carry out its mandate .
Even after losing the control of government in May this year over the enigmatic issue of civilian supremacy , Maoists have not softened their stance on the president ’s action that re-instated the ex-army chief after his firing by the then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal .
In order to further press on this issue , Maoists have announced formation of autonomous states in several parts of the country in defiance of the wishes of government , which also seems to challenge the constitution - making authority of CA .
By doing so — unilaterally deciding to divide up the country into ethnic enclaves — Maoists have started the process of a slow dissolution of the State which they eventually would turn into an all - powerful proletarian dictatorship , making the country a one - party State .
This particular perception of Maoists ’ ultimate objective and long - term planning is not based on fancy or conjecture but comes straight out of their public declarations that claim the virtues of ‘ fusion ’ of ideologies and role of peoples ’ war — jana yudhha — as means to capturing the State power .
The Maoist strategy of declaring autonomous states is probably the shrewdest means adopted until now to undercut the legitimacy of Maoist - version of a bourgeoisie State and assert people ’s power under its own leadership .
And this strategy would be highly appealing for the grassroots , who have had no great admiration for all - powerful Kathmandu - based governments doing the dictates of generations of family dynasties and self - serving corrupt politicians .
With the promises of self - rule allowed to ethnic majorities under the autonomous state system , ordinary people can see the benefits of localization of government authority , with a chance of liberating themselves from the tyrannies of centrist authoritarian rule .
Facing the challenge
Needless to say , government is at a loss on how to face up to the Maoist new challenge .
The easiest course of action will be to ignore it — let them disrupt house - sitting , demonstrate on the street , put - up road blocks , spread anarchy , and declare more autonomous states , which can be viewed as no more than a symbolic defiance .
However , by ignoring such threats to its authority , the government in power is unlikely to generate confidence and win sympathies , or hope that current impasse is going to end quietly and uneventfully .
If Maoists continue with its present strategy of making the central government look irrelevant , indifferent , and detached from the basic functions of the State , there will be no need for them to make a forceful entry into the capital to capture power .
This will come to them naturally and effortlessly — from the growing irrelevance of government at the center , aided by gradual shift of state functions to regional , autonomous states .
There should be nothing wrong with the slow dissolution and eventual disappearance of the traditional State and its replacement by a grassroots entity that is built - up from grounds up .
Indeed , by forcing the dissolution of the State , Maoists would be making a bloodless coup , which would be entirely legitimate in an environment of deepening conflict , lack of direction , heightened uncertainty , and loss of control over critical government functions .
There is not much that the Maoist - less current coalition government can do to stop or even slowdown the country moving in this direction except if it chooses to force - stop the process by making a last - ditch effort and take one extreme measure , similar to the one advocated by NC leaders noted above — presidential rule backed by the army .
Given the limited options the current government has in outsmarting the Maoists , it may be attracted to do just that and the army would , most likely , choose to go along .
The army ’s willingness to comply with such an option can be argued in two ways , the first being that it never got to use its full force to suppress Maoist rebels during their decade - old insurgency .
Reportedly , the army was held back by palace orders , which had to come to think of Maoist challenge more as a counter to political parties than a threat to itself .
Second , by making civilian supremacy a battle - cry , Maoists , once in power , will seek a quick dissolution of the army , which they view as the last hurdle on the road to complete victory .
Maoists have been in sort of an undeclared war with the army for sometime now but it is becoming increasingly certain that the army will not just sit back and surrender .
Rather , it may be getting ready for a showdown and final war with the Maoists — an opportunity it was looking for during king ’s regime but was repeatedly denied .
Army ’s willingness to face up to the Maoists will be strengthened if its actions are given the legitimacy of enforcing presidential rule , which is allowed under the constitution .
A discouraging outlook
There are many ways in which the current conflict can get resolved and the much - lauded peace effort moved towards its logical conclusion — which is to get an agreement on the constitution , hold broad - based election , and usher in an era of constitutional rule that upholds people ’s sovereignty .
However , the outlook for consensus building and restoration of normal conditions appear increasingly dim , even non-existent .
The main reason for pessimism is that communism generally , and Maoism in particular , is now a ground reality in the country , reflecting not as much the smartness of ideology Maoists have brought to bear upon the population but the utter incompetence , lack of vision , and unabashed dishonesty of the regimes that have governed Nepal for decades and centuries .
In particular , all of them have failed to create glue that binds people together , encourage them to pursue a common goal , and motivate them to work for a better future , for themselves and their children .
The Maoists have taken advantage of this vacuum by creating grassroots organizations to bring the people together , partly by the force of their ideology but mostly by aligning people against the hereditary and traditional interests .
Of course , the record of nine - month rule by Maoists has caused much disappointment and helped cool down enthusiasm for its long - term sustainability but they continue to remain in public consciousness as the last hope for people who consider themselves dispossessed and have not much to lose from serious anarchy and breakdown of the law and order .
At least one half of the country ’s population would fit this category who seem united backing up Maoists ’ intention of winning over and destroying the bourgeoisie democracy .
Presidential rule or army takeover can eliminate some Maoists and subdue their backers but it will be incapable of winning the ideological war .
At the same time , if the ideologically - hardened comrades in hundreds of thousands face up to the army onslaught and engage them in running battles , the situation can easily get out of hand and millions will flee to take shelter across the border in India .
It is difficult to predict how India will respond to the emergence of calamitous situation across its 800 - kilometer open border with Nepal , but it is hard to think that it will do nothing .
Most likely , it will commit itself actively to prevent the spread of violence , including the stationing of its own peace - keeping force to keep order .
Of course , such a move will have unknown consequences for Nepal ’s separate and independent existence .
There is little or nothing to take a bet on how the events are going to unfold over the coming months and years , but the present cat - and - mouse maneuverings by political parties and Maoists are likely to move the conflict to center - stage for a showdown .
If this comes to pass , army will have a greater chance of claiming victory , provided that the conflict involves mostly the leadership on the top .
Another big uncertainty is if Nepal has the good fortune of some strongmen rising to the occasion — the likes of Korea ’s Park Chung - He , Chile ’s Pinochet , Indonesia ’s Suharto — to take up the challenge of suppressing dissent and mobilizing the machinery of the State to focus on only one mission : Building a strong and prosperous nation .
With so many options tried over so many years to eradicate poverty and catch - up on the bandwagon of growth , opportunities and prosperity , this last option may just have a chance to succeed .

Cheques to be phased out in 2018
Experts have been looking for alternatives to the cheque Cheques will be phased out by October 2018 , but only if adequate alternatives are developed , the body that oversees payments strategy has said .
The board of the UK Payments Council has set the date in a bid to encourage the advance of other forms of payment .
The first cheque was written 350 years ago and the decision will be greeted with disappointment by some small businesses and consumers .
The Council said there should be " no scenario " for using cheques by 2018 .
The target date for the closure of the system that processes cheques has been set for 31 October 2018 , after the board described the payment method as in " terminal decline " .
However , there will be annual checks on the progress of other payments systems and a final review of the decision will be held in 2016 .
" The goal is to ensure that by 2018 there is no scenario where customers , individuals or businesses , still need to use a cheque , " the Payments Council said in a statement .
" The board will be especially concerned that the needs of elderly and vulnerable people are met . "
The decision was not unanimous , however the four independent members of the board - who are not from the banking industry - voted in favour of setting the target date .
Plumber payments
The Payments Council accepted that cheques were still used for payments to sole traders , small businesses , clubs , charities and schools .
Now it wants to find " easy - to- use efficient alternatives " to the cheque which are understood by everybody .

" Customers are not likely to see any immediate change as the target date is still a long way off , " said Paul Smee , chief executive of the Payments Council .
" There are many more efficient ways of making payments than by paper in the 21st century , and the time is ripe for the economy as a whole to reap the benefits of its replacement .
" But the real challenge lies ahead if we are going to be comfortable to wave goodbye to the cheque , which undeniably occupies a unique place in British culture . "
Alternative methods Banks and credit providers have been investing in chips which allow a customer to pay when the chip is pushed against a sensor , known as contactless technology .
The use of mobile phones to allow people to make payments is also regularly promoted as the future of payments systems .
Charities representing older people have said that paper - based payments systems should be available for those who are not comfortable with new technology .
ANALYSIS By Kevin Peachey , personal finance reporter , BBC News Considering a life without cheques leaves many people unsure about how they would pay a plumber or builder .
Today the UK Payments Council has demanded that suitable alternatives are in place for everyone by the time cheques go .
So that could mean technology - already used in Africa - which allows people to transfer money by mobile phone , or cheap and efficient debit card readers that could be used by small businesses .
If that happens , it could also lessen the demand for cash , and the mobile phone could become a virtual wallet .
Q&A : Cheques facing retirement ?
Changing times
Your views on cheques " We are concerned that this [ decision ] will give the green light to banks and retailers to start phasing them out even sooner [ than 2018 ] , " said Andrew Harrop , of Age Concern and Help the Aged .
" The Payments Council needs to urgently come up with some practical alternatives to replace cheques or it will be condemning thousands of older people to extra worry , cost and financial insecurity . "
Dot Gibson , of the National Pensioners Convention , said : " This is such a selfish decision , made by people who are clearly out of touch with the way millions of older pensioners manage their affairs . "
Cheque use Many stores - including all the major UK supermarket chains - have chosen to stop accepting cheques as shoppers turned to debit cards or stick with cash .
Cheques are also the most expensive form of transaction for shops .
The cheque 's predecessor was the bill of exchange - a way for traders to buy and sell goods without the need to carry cumbersome and valuable quantities of gold and silver .
The earliest cheque in the UK was thought to have been written 350 years ago , dated 16 February .
It was made out for £ 400 , signed by Nicholas Vanacker , made payable to a Mr Delboe , and drawn on Messrs Morris and Clayton - scriveners and bankers of the City of London .
In the early days , cheques were used relatively infrequently , mainly by merchants and traders for high - value transactions .
They had to be confident that these handwritten pieces of paper could be guaranteed .
They were often issued by goldsmiths within a local network of traders who knew and trusted each other .
Printing processes meant they started to be used by customers of commercial banks .
Personal cheque payment volumes reached a peak of 2.4 billion in 1990 , and have since fallen steadily to 663 million in 2008 .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Back during the 2008 campaign , one of the things that most infuriated me was the emails that went around with all sorts of claims about Obama that referred to outside authorities such as Snopes or Obama ’s memoirs .
( See here , here , here , here , and here . )
People forwarded these items , but never took the time to check out these basic claims .
As FactCheck.org observed at the time :
Such attacks usually can be disproved with less effort than it takes to forward them to others .
Now , of course political debate has always been about framing events and pushing one ’s agenda – about creating stories and propaganda to demonize your enemy and rile up your supporters .
And there have always been lies , and every other sort of assault on the truth .
There have always been fringe movements that require their supporters to believe elaborate constructions of lies built into conspiracy theories .
But beginning with the rise of Obama in the spring of 2008 , the Republican Party itself has become such a fringe group – as it has mainly stopped engaging in more honest political dialogue such as ideological arguments and good - faith disputes over facts .
America ’s political debate has turned into lies and efforts to combat these lies .
( For the prime example , see the primal scream of outrage that was the health care debate .
Here , here , here . )
How a propaganda source lies or frames issues tells us a lot about how its creators view their audience .
As Jason Zengerle has sagely noted , the fictional world that Republican media is selling of grand conspiracies and ominous music demonstrates that they see their audience primarily as consumers who want entertainment .
Is this season of 24 over ?
Then check out Fox News for the same adrenaline rush .
Or read a Vince Flynn novel .
Either way , you ’ll get stories of grand conspiracies by terrorists with weak liberals being saved by brave conservatives .
Thus Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh , and much of the rest of the Republican media establishment started out as and still describe themselves as “ entertainers ” rather than journalists .
Then , of course , as I ’ve observed in the past , TownHall.com just presumes its readers are gullible , lazy idiots – sending them get - rich - quick - schemes ( See here and here . ) in addition to their political lies .
( See here , here , and here . )
The creators of the smear emails clearly similarly saw their audience as gullible and unlikely to check the sources they cited in support , even as they made the most outrageous claims .
What all three of these propaganda sources have in common is that they do n’t expect their audience to fact check their smears , but expect them to act on them and spread them to others .
They do not expect their audience to be skeptical , but to simply accept and promote the smears .
I was reminded of this by another smear that got spread – this time via reddit .
( Probably other sites too – but reddit is the only one I pay attention to . )
I normally see reddit as made up of rather skeptical individuals .
But a few times , as a whole , the reddit community seems to have bought whole various smears and propaganda efforts – usually when they were both ( 1 ) emotional and ( 2 ) fit into some preconceived bias , usually a bias against the establishment media .
Thus , when Russia invaded Georgia almost two years ago , reddit promoted various Russian propaganda claims and demoted any support for Georgia – despite the fact that atrocities were being committed by both sides and Russia ’s actions clearly violated international law .
When I challenged people on this , the most common reaction was to say that they were just trying to balance the mainstream media which was very pro-Georgia .
Another example of this occurred on reddit last week – as headlines were voted up reaching the top of reddit claiming :
Anyone who followed up and read beyond the headline of the piece in the Guardian that most of these stories linked to would have found that an Israeli doctor had admitted that Israeli hospitals had harvested organs from patients “ including Palestinians ” who died in their hospitals , as they did not have a policy which required them to get permission . *
Shortly thereafter , the Guardian followed up and said :
This headline got much less attention .
Even more interesting than those too lazy to read the article were those who claimed vindication for the Swedish newspaper that had previously reported that Israel had been killing Palestinians in order to harvest their organs :
Yet the Guardian story by Ian Black specifically addressed the Swedish story :
Channel 2 TV reported that in the 1990s , specialists at Abu Kabir harvested skin , corneas , heart valves and bones from the bodies of Israeli soldiers , Israeli citizens , Palestinians and foreign workers , often without permission from relatives …
However , there was no evidence that Israel had killed Palestinians to take their organs , as the Swedish paper reported .
Reading through the comments on these posts , you will find quite a bit of blatant anti-Semitism , as well as people disputing and disparaging these anti-Semitic comments .
But should it be called anti-Semitism when people were so willing to jump to the conclusion that in fact Israel had some program which sought to harvest Palestinian organs ?
I ’m not sure .
But it is disturbing – almost as disturbing as those many right wingers fooled into thinking Obama is a secret Muslim born in Kenya ( and that Snopes confirmed it ! )
I expect better from reddit .
I expect people to be skeptical .
When I read a story that says that Obama is a secret Muslim , that Israel is killing Palestinians to harvest their organs , that the health care legislation will create death panels and kill babies , I regard it with as much skepticism as when I am told that if I subscribe to this or that newsletter , I will make $ 1 million in less than a year .
Before I vote up or forward an email or invest in a stock , I check the sources .
This is n’t unreasonable – and redditors are usually decent about this – which is what made this story so bothersome .
* These headlines are as misleading as a headline on November 5 , 2009 would be claiming that “ McCain receives third largest vote total in American history ! ” without mentioning the guy who won .

For the multi-tasking type this will enable you to create 2 side by side “ panels ” in Chrome in the same tab so you can browse two sites at once side by side .
Why not switch between tabs ?
A few reasons , maybe you want to compare search results on both Google and Yahoo or do side by side comparisons of products .
Maybe you want to reference something in the left panel and type about it in the right and switching tabs is a pain ..
Well this will enable you to do just that .

After starting out with an extremely bare - bones implementation of a key - value store , it 's time to make our first two incremental improvements in our quest towards Dynamo : implementing durable writes and consistent reads .
W , R and N
In our initial implementation , we immediately notified the client that an update was successful , and did not verify that the updates had actually been written in the remote nodes .
lists : foreach ( fun ( Pid ) ->
Pid !
{ self ( ) , update , Key , Value } end , pg2 : get_members ( kvs ) ) , Sender ! { self ( ) , received , { set , Key , Value }} ,
While simple to implement , this approach is unreliable because it assumes the writes are successful .
It could be that the other processes are down1 , but we would still dutifully inform the client that their change had been successfully recorded .
To resolve this weakness , we 'll make reading and writing a one - phase commit ( rather than the zero phase commit we have now , aka firing blindly ) 2 .
After receiving a write request from a client , the receiver will wait for the writing nodes to acknowledge back success before responding to the client .
However , once we decide to perform a more sophisticated commit protocol , a few questions come up :
Knowing that we need to wait before informing the client of a successful write , how many nodes should we wait for ?
In the same vein , when we are reading values , how many nodes should we query before returning the value to the client ?
Rather than providing fixed answers , Dynamo makes these two values configurable ( along with a third value , the number of nodes data is replicated to ) , and by doing so makes each Dynamo cluster highly customizable to the needs of its consumer .
These configurable values are :
N is the number of nodes where each piece of data is replicated ( for our current implementation N is equal to the number of nodes in the system ) .
is the number of nodes where each piece of data is replicated ( for our current implementation is equal to the number of nodes in the system ) .
W is the number of nodes where each piece of data is written before notifying the user of success ( our implementation is W := N , sort of 3 ) .
is the number of nodes where each piece of data is written before notifying the user of success ( our implementation is , sort of ) .
R is the number of nodes which are consulted for their value of a key ( currently in our implementation R := 1 ) .
Combining these values in different ways creates data - stores with extremely different properties .
A system with W := N , R:= 1 will write to every single node before notifying a user of success , and is a low - availability write system as a single downed node will prevent further writes .
However , by guaranteeing updates are written to every node , it is possible to get the latest value by reading from only a single node , making it the system highly available for reads .
On the opposite end of the spectrum , a W := 1 , R := N system would be highly available for writes , but with low availability for reads .
If it 's important to never reject a write , such inefficient reads might be justifiable .
For most users , the values of W and R will be somewhere between 1 and N .
According to the Dynamo paper , Amazon finds N := 3 , W := 2 , R := 2 to be a reasonable balance between performance and reliability for most applications .
Now let 's take a look at extending our key - value store to respect configurable values of W and R ( we 'll have to take on N later ) .
Records , Configuration & kvs.hrl
In the previous post I mentioned that - define s are usually kept in separate files with the .hrl extension , and now it 's time for us to start using one .
In this case we 'll be calling it kvs.hrl .
First , we 'll be adding constant values for W and R ( as well as moving over the TIMEOUT value ) ,
- define ( KVS_WRITES , 3 ) . - define ( KVS_READS , 3 ) . - define ( TIMEOUT , 500 ) .
but more importantly we 'll be creating an Erlang record to manage the increasing amounts of state maintained by kvs:store / 1 .
Erlang records are nothing more than tuples with some syntactic sugar to make it possible for a human to access the contained values without remembering the elements ' ordering .
For most purposes , the syntactic sugar really is the biggest gain from using records , but there is a performance advantage versus using a property list4 .
Our kvs_store record will start out looking like this :
- record ( kvs_store , { data , pending_reads , pending_writes } ) .
We 'll use data to store our key - value mappings , pending_reads to store reads which are still waiting for additional nodes ' values before returning to user , and pending_writes for writes which are waiting for confirmation from additional nodes before notifying user of a successful write .
% a brief interlude for record syntax Store = # kvs_store { data = [ ] , pending_reads = [ ] , pending_writes = [ ]} , #kvs_store { data = D , pending_reads = R , pending_writes = W } = Store , Writes = Store #kvsstore.pending_writes , get_value ( Key , S = # kvs_store { data = Data } ) -> proplists : get_value ( Key , Data ) . set_value ( Key , Value , S = #kvs_store { data = Data } ) ->
S # { data = [{
Key , Value } | proplists : delete ( Key , Data ) ]} .
We 'll need to add an - include at the top of kvs.erl to take advantage of the record definition .
- include ( " kvs.hrl " ) .
And we 'll also need to update the kvs : start / 1 function to use the record :
% % @doc create N nodes in distributed key - value store % % @spec start ( integer ( ) ) -> started start ( N ) -> pg2 : create ( kvs ) , lists : foreach ( fun ( _ ) ->
Store = # kvs_store { data = [ ] , pending_reads = [ ] , pending_writes = [ ]} , pg2 : join ( kvs , spawn ( kvs , store , [ Store ] ) ) end , lists : seq ( 0 , N ) ) , started .
With that done , now we can move on to implementing durable writes .
Durable Writes
The first step in our implementation of durable writes is to update the interface of the store / 1 function ( this change is necessary for the consistent read changes we make below as well ) .
The function 's arity will remain unchanged , but we 'll be passing around our new kvs_store record instead of the old property list .
% old definition store ( Data ) -> term ( ) . % new definition store ( Store = #kvs_store { data = Data , pending_reads = Reads , pending_writes = Writes } ) -> term ( ) .
The skeptical reader may wonder why we went through the bother of defining a record when we could have simply changed the function definition to
store ( Data , Reads , Writes ) -> term ( ) .
and been done with it .
A reason to prefer the record is that you only pull out the necessary data , and do n't have to juggle unused values .
This becomes particularly meaningful as a record grows from an arity of one to an arity of three , from an arity of three to an arity of six , and so on .
In the end , however , it is a matter of style .
Now that we 've updated the function definition , it is time for us to start updating the receive block .
We 'll examine the set , update and updated messages independently , but keep in mind that they are all patterns matching against store / 1 's mailbox .
set , update and updated
Receiving a set patterned messages is the beginning of the update process , so we 'll begin there .
Previously set would broadcast the updated key - value pair to all nodes and then immediately notify the user that the write was successful , but now we 're going to track the number of acks received from writing nodes and wait until they pass the W threshold before notifying the user of a successful write .
{ Sender , set , Key , Value } -> % client interface for updating values lists : foreach ( fun ( Pid ) ->
Pid !
{ self ( ) , update , Sender , Key , Value } end , pg2 : get_members ( kvs ) ) , Writes2 = [ { {
Sender , Key } , ?KVS_WRITES } | Writes ] , store ( Store # kvs_store { pending_writes = Writes2 } ) ;
With these changes , all nodes maintain a property list in pending_writes which contain all writes which have been initiated but still have n't surpassed the W threshold for a durable write .
The keys in pending_writes are a 2 - tuple of the client process id ( the pid which called the kvs: set / 2 function ) and the key which is being updated ; the values are counters which contain the number of additional acknowledgements required before the write threshold is surpassed .
{ Sender , update , Client , Key , Value } -> % sent to all nodes by first receiving node Sender !
{ self ( ) , updated , Client , Key , Value } , store ( Store #kvs_store { data = [{
Key , Value } | proplists : delete ( Key , Data ) ] } ) ;
As nodes receive an update , they notify the node which received the original set message that they have successfully updated the key 's value .
{_ Sender , updated , Client , Key , Value } ->
Count = proplists : get_value ({ Client , Key } , Writes ) , case Count of undefined -> store ( Store ) ; 0 -> Client !
{ self ( ) , received , { set , Key , Value }} , store ( Store #kvs_store { pending_writes = proplists : delete ( { Key , Value } , Writes ) } ) ; _ -> store ( Store #kvs_store { pending_writes = [ { { Client , Key } , Count - 1 } | proplists : delete ( { Client , Key } , Writes ) ]} ) end ;
As other nodes acknowledge a successful write the corresponding write counter is decremented .
Once it has been full decremented the Client pid is notified of a successful durable write , and the write is deleted from the pending_writes property list .
Further acknowledgements for that update are ignored .
Consistent Reads
Implementing consistent reads follows a pattern similar to durable writes , but with the added complexity of reconciling inconsistent reads ( i.e. what to do if one node says the value if 5 and another says the value is 16 ) .
First we implement the read fanout , which sends reads to the other nodes and then adds the new read to pending_reads .
{ Sender , get , Key } -> % client interface for retrieving values lists : foreach ( fun ( Pid ) ->
Pid !
{ self ( ) , retrieve , Sender , Key } end , pg2 : get_members ( kvs ) ) , % ?
KVS_READS is required # of nodes to read from % [ ] is used to collect read values Reads2 = [ { {
Sender , Key } , { ?
KVS_READS , [ ]}} | Reads ] , store ( Store # kvs_store { pending_reads = Reads2 } ) ;
Next , sending sending the local value of the key back to the node which received the original get message .
{ Sender , retrieve , Client , Key } ->
Sender ! { self ( ) , retrieved , Client , Key , proplists : get_value ( Key , Data ) } , store ( Store ) ;
Finally , the logic for decrementing the counter in pending_reads and for collecting the values returned from various nodes via retrieve messages .
{_ Sender , retrieved , Client , Key , Value } -> case proplists : get_value ({ Client , Key } , Reads ) of { 0 , Values } ->
Freq = lists : foldr ( fun ( X , Acc ) -> case proplists : get_value ( X , Acc ) of undefined -> [{
X , 1 } | Acc ] ; N -> [{
X , N + 1 } | proplists : delete ( X , Acc ) ] end end , [ ] , Values ) , [{ Popular , _} | _ ] = lists : reverse ( lists : keysort ( 2 , Freq ) ) , Client ! { self ( ) , got , Popular } , store ( Store #kvs_store { pending_reads = proplists : delete ( { Key , Value } , Reads ) } ) ; { Count , Values } -> store ( Store #kvs_store { pending_reads = [ { { Client , Key } , { Count - 1 , [ Value | Values ]}} | proplists : delete ( { Client , Key } , Reads ) ]} ) end ;
Note that we 're using an extremely weak algorithm for resolving inconsistent reads : we pick the most common value ( if there are multiple most common values , then we indirectly pick one based on the order of responses from the reading nodes ) .
If we can bear with this unsightliness for the moment , the next entry will take a look at using various kinds of clocks to great improvements in read consistency .
Failing Reads and Writes
In addition to a weak algorithm for resolving inconsistencies , another flaw in our current implementation is the handling of reads and writes which fail or otherwise cannot complete .
Consider a system where W := 10 , but there are only five available nodes due to a node failure .
The write counter will never reach zero , and thus a response will never be sent to the user .
That does n't make for a very usable system .
A reasonable solution is to consider all pending operations older than some timeout value to have failed , and then to notify the user that the read / write was a failure .
Currently we 're not storing when a set or get request comes in , so we ''ll need to extend the information recorded in pending_reads and pending_writes to include a timestamp .
First we need to write a utility function to convert the output of erlang : now / 0 into seconds since epoch ,
ts ( ) -> { Mega , Sec , _} = erlang : now ( ) , ( Mega * 1000000 ) + Sec .
and next we need to update a number of the receive patterns , starting with the set pattern , which needs to be updated to create pending writes as a 2 - tuple of the number required writes and time the request was received ( previously it was only the number of required writes ) .
{ Sender , set , Key , Value } -> lists : foreach ( fun ( Pid ) ->
Pid !
{ self ( ) , update , Sender , Key , Value } end , pg2 : get_members ( kvs ) ) , Writes2 = [ { {
Sender , Key } , { ?
KVS_WRITES , ts ( ) }} | Writes ] , store ( Store # kvs_store { pending_writes = Writes2 } ) ;
updated requires a change as well , to extract Count properly from the new 2 - tuple , as well as properly formatting the value when decrementing Count .
{_ Sender , updated , Client , Key , Value } -> { Count , Timestamp } = proplists : get_value ({ Client , Key } , Writes ) , case Count of undefined -> store ( Store ) ; 0 -> Client !
{ self ( ) , received , { set , Key , Value }} , store ( Store #kvs_store { pending_writes = proplists : delete ( { Key , Value } , Writes ) } ) ; _ -> store ( Store #kvs_store { pending_writes = [ { { Client , Key } , { Count - 1 , Timestamp }} | proplists : delete ( { Client , Key } , Writes ) ]} ) end ;
We need to make corresponding changes for reading , but we probably do n't need to explicitly view those changes ( but feel free to examine the diff where those changes occured , if you 're interested ) .
The last major change we need to make is adding an after block following the receive block in store / 1 , which will allow us to periodically check for expired reads and writes .
after ?
KVS_POLL_PENDING
-> Writes2 = lists : filter ( fun filter_writes / 1 , Writes ) , Reads2 = lists : filter ( fun filter_reads / 1 , Reads ) , store ( Store #kvs_store { pending_writes = Writes2 , pending_reads = Reads2 } ) end .
filter_writes /1 and filter_reads / 1 detect pending operations which are taking too long to complete , notify the client that their request failed , and then removes the failed operation from the pending_writes and pend_reads lists respectively .
filter_writes ( {{ Client , _ Key } , {_ Count , Ts }} ) ->
Now = ts ( ) , if Now > Ts + ?
KVS_WRITE_TIMEOUT
->
Client !
{ error , write_failed } , false ; true -> true end .
filter_reads ( {{ Client , _ Key } , {_ Count , _ Values , Ts }} ) ->
Now = ts ( ) , if Now > Ts + ?
KVS_READ_TIMEOUT
->
Client !
{ error , read_failed } , false ; true -> true end .
It was n't strictly necessary to implementing these functions outside of the receive block , but it is becoming rather sizable , and it 'll be easier to modify if we carve it up a bit .
( This is also the first time we 've seen the Erlang if block , whose guards I tend to like less than case 's pattern matching .
This is certainly a matter of style , but I prefer using case in all situations , except those which devolve into the snippet case X of true ->
A ; false ->
B end ; , which seems like trying a bit too hard to avoid if . )
Finally , the absolutely last modification , we 'll also need to add the timeout value to kvs.hrl .
- define ( KVS_WRITE_TIMEOUT , 2 ) . % seconds - define ( KVS_READ_TIMEOUT , 1 ) . % seconds - define ( KVS_POLL_PENDING , 500 ) . % ms
After making all of our changes , let 's start kvs with only a single node and a configuration of W := 3 , R := 3 .
14 > c ( kvs ) . {ok , kvs} 15 > kvs : stop ( ) . stopped 16 > kvs : start ( 1 ) . started 17 > kvs : get ( a ) . {error , read_failed} 18 > kvs : set ( b , 10 ) . {error , write_failed}
There is our successful handling of failed pending reads and writes .
Excellent .
With that , our second batch of changes comes to a close ; a snapshot of the updated code is available on GitHub .
In the next article we 'll take a more principled stance on consistent reads by exploring the impact of using physical , logical and vector clocks to version and reconcile values .
The post should be up in a couple of days .
What do milk , cigarettes , underage girls , Belgium , and lengthy tasks have in common ?
They 're all verboten in Facebook contests .
The Center for Consumer Freedom is publicizing this outstanding list of official prohibitions in Facebook 's new promotions guidelines :
Section 2 . Prohibitions
You may not publicize or administer a promotion on Facebook if : 2.1
The promotion is open or marketed to individuals who are under the age of 18 ; 2.2
The promotion is open to individuals who reside in a country embargoed by the United States ; 2.3
The promotion , if a sweepstakes , is open to individuals residing in Belgium , Norway , Sweden , or India ; 2.4
The promotion 's objective is to promote any of the following product categories : gambling , tobacco , dairy , firearms , prescription drugs , or gasoline ; 2.5
The prize or any part of the prize includes alcohol , tobacco , dairy , firearms , or prescription drugs ; or 2.6
The promotion is a sweepstakes that conditions entry upon the purchase of a product , completion of a lengthy task , or other form of consideration .
Before CCF cottoned on , only one other site which seems to have noticed the ban : Green living site Taste Better , which put up a post a month ago titled " Facebook goes ( kind of ) dairy free " :
Facebook has updated their rules about what marketers can promote on the site , along with how they can do it .
Wanna know what can't be promoted ?
Product categories including gambling , tobacco , firearms , prescription drugs , or gasoline .
Oh , and dairy .
Oh , and if the prizes from your campaign include , wait for it , alcohol , tobacco , firearms , prescription drugs or… dairy .
Now , I do n't think this means that everything on Facebook has to be dairy free ( for instance , I 'd guess that milk chocolate would be allowed but cheese would n't ) but hey , I could be wrong , and in any case , suck it , dairy board !
I assume the addition of dairy to the list has little to do with an anti-brie bias , and more to do with ( ridiculous ) restrictions about shipping dairy across state or national borders .
But the catalog of banned items strongly resembles my grocery list ( alcohol , tobacco , dairy , firearms , prescription drugs , peanut butter ) , so I 'm sad to see it sitting there under the word " Prohibitions " — no matter what the reason .
UPDATE : From the fine folks at Facebook :
By Daniel Emery
Technology reporter , BBC News
Google launched its property service in Australia last August .
Google is set to launch a property dimension to its UK mapping system .
The new service will allow both estate agents and private sellers to put their property as an overlay on Google Maps .
The plans were outlined at a conference called Estate Agency Events last week , although Google has declined to give official confirmation .
Shares in the property portal Rightmove fell more than 10 % as news emerged , the sharpest faller in the FTSE 350 index of companies for the day .
The new service is expected to launch next year and would be similar to a service Google launched in Australia .
Sarah Beeny says
Google will level the property playing field
That site allows estate agents to list properties for free , with pictures taken from its Street View service and listing details on a map .
Speaking to BBC News , Edward Mead - sales director for Douglas & Gordon estate agents - said that the new system would be a win-win situation for both Google and estate agents .
" The technology to do this is already in place and estate agents are a little busier these days , although transactions are still fifty per cent down on what they once were .
" So this service , which is free , will appeal to estate agents ' cost - cutting nature and given that sixty per cent of agents are one - off traders , this will have serious appeal . "
Mr Mead said that Google 's head of property and classified team , Ben Wood , briefed 30 of England 's top estate agents at Estate Agency Events last week , telling them everything about the system , other than an official launch date .
' Hurt estate agents '
But Sarah Beeny , who presents Channel 4's Property Ladder and also runs her own home sales property site Tepilo , told BBC News that the service could well damage estate agents in the long run .
" It will hurt estate agents and it will hurt property sites like Rightmove .
" If it does what Google says it will , then it brings the buyer and seller closer together and that could mean removing blocks in the way , and that could mean no longer having to pay extortionate fees to estate agents .
" It will certainly blow Rightmove out of the water .
You can only get your property listed on that site if you are an estate agent - what Google will do is level the playing field and they are doing it for free , " she said .
The site would directly link property buyers with vendors
The news shook traders on the London Stock Exchange .
At one point , shares in online property portal Rightmove fell by 13 % over concern about competition from the world 's biggest search engine , although a late afternoon rally saw them close 10 % down at £ 4.95 a share .
The firm remained bullish , despite the news .
Speaking to BBC
News , the company 's commercial director , Miles Shipside , said his business was still strong and the site was still getting lots of traffic .
" It remains to be seen what actually happens , " he said .
" Google is a big name , but they do n't always manage to follow things through on a local level .
" We only list property with estate agents due to UK legislation .
Agents offer very good value and charge very competitive rates compared to the rest of the world .

Well , That Happened : The 10 Things I Will Remember About the '00s
Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
The other day , I had a random thought : will anyone ever be nostalgic for the '00s ?
From my admittedly biased perspective ( I did n't come of age in this decade , so my perspective is n't as rose - colored as it may be for others ) , the answer is an emphatic ' no . '
The political climate was as toxic and divisive as the country has ever known .
The music business fell to pieces .
Baseball suffered , and is still suffering , its worst scandal .
A football player was caught killing dogs .
Tweens started dressing like strippers .
Sexting .
Paris Hilton .
Television was as good as it's ever been , but so what ?
It 's only television .
Then again , we 're sometimes nostalgic for days gone by not because of what happened in the world , but because of what happened to us .
( Again , that whole coming - of - age thing . )
Someone will lose their virginity to a Creed song , and have a soft spot for the band for the rest of their lives because of it .
That 's how nostalgia works ; it can't be reasoned with , which means that someone will think of these as the best days of their lives .
Yikes .
And yet , it would be wrong to say that the '00s were without their charms .
As I said , television was pretty awesome , and that " Umbrella " song will bury every man , woman and child currently living today .
As the Bullz - Eye staff assemble their lists for favorite this and that of 2009 and the decade as a whole , I began with something a little more personal : the ten things that had the biggest impact on my life and those around me , both good and bad .
In order to end this piece on a high note , I 'm tempting fate by starting with the bad , sort of like when the Doors would open their sets with " The End . "
And this first bad is very , very bad .
THE FIVE BAD THINGS
September 11 , 2001
As if this list could start with anything else .
I was actually on one of the last planes to land that day .
My wife and I had taken a red eye from Hawaii to Dallas , and at 6:30 in the morning we hopped on a nearly empty plane - much like the ones that were hijacked – bound for Chicago .
We walked through O'Hare like it was any other day ; no one knew anything yet .
I happened to see the bank of monitors listing departures , and saw that all flights to New York , Boston and Washington D.C. had been cancelled .
I figured there was a storm front on the east coast .
It was n't until we got in the cab that it started coming together .
" Hey , did you hear about the fire ? " the cabbie said innocently .
Then we listened to it all unfold on the way home .
It was like listening to Orson Welles ' Martian invasion broadcast , only it was real .
You wo n't get any moralizing from me on the subject , because really , who cares .
But I do n't think it 's any mystery that we as a country have not fully recovered from the events of that day , and at this point I 'm not sure we ever will .
And that makes me sad ; I liked the world better before everyone was a hostile cynic .
2003 NLCS , Florida Marlins vs. Chicago Cubs
As a longtime Cubs fan , it looked as though the stars had finally aligned .
And through my wife 's excellent work contacts , we scored tickets – free ones , no less – to every game at Wrigley .
The Cubs lost Game 1 , but Sammy Sosa 's game - tying home run in the bottom of the ninth was the most amazing sports moment I 've ever witnessed .
That place was louder than God .
They killed the Marlins in Game 2 – Sosa launched a ball that landed on the center field camera shed – and when they came back to Chicago up three games to two with Mark Prior headed to the hill , I did what no Cubs fan should ever do : I felt hopeful .
In fact , when the Cubs got that first out in the top of the eighth with a 3 - 0 lead , my friends and I actually held up five fingers and said , " Only five more outs ! "
Everyone except my friend John , that is .
He 's an Indians fan ; he knew better .
As history will tell you , that is the precise moment when all hell broke loose .
Moises
Alou tangles with the unluckiest Cubs fan in the world and can't make the second out .
The normally sure - handed Alex Gonzalez boots an easy double play ball .
With three runs in and the bases loaded , Sosa finally catches a fly ball for the second out , but overthrows the cutoff man trying to gun down the go - ahead run at home that he was never , ever going to catch .
The runners advance to second and third on Sosa 's throw , forcing the Cubs to issue an intentional walk .
One three - run double later , and the Cubs are suddenly down by four .
Meanwhile , manager Dusty Baker refused to use a well - rested Matt Clement in either of the final two games , insisting that " starters are starters and relievers are relievers . "
And losers are losers , Dusty .
Even when they were winning in Game 7 , I had seen enough to know that it would not last .
And sure enough , it did n't .
My friend Lee will still get excited when the Cubs are playing well .
Not me , not anymore .
This series effectively killed my inner child .
The low cost of recording equipment
Let me guess : you just said , " You 're arguing against the low cost of recording equipment ? "
Absolutely .
Now that virtually anyone can make their own music , every spoiled , over - privileged teenager now feels that it is their God - given right to do so .
It 's not .
Say what you want about the major label system before downloads brought them to their knees , but there was some quality control taking place when they were the gatekeepers .
That filter has since been removed , and now all it takes is a few million fake hits on a MySpace page , a greased palm on this or that music blog ( writers are ridiculously easy to bribe ; start with booze ) , and boom , suddenly Johnny Bedroom is a big deal .
( In fact , our own Jeff Giles is convinced that the success of Conor Oberst is a practical joke hatched by the editors of Pitchfork gone horribly wrong . )
Where bands used to have to gig for years – and thus improve in the process , which benefited all concerned – they can now make waves with little more than sleight of hand .
This is n't good for anyone .
The marketplace was already overcrowded ; now it 's ten times worse , making it virtually impossible for a band to maintain a high commercial profile for more than an album or two .
As bands have struggled to maintain chart success , listeners ' tastes have become more liquid ( which is a nice way of saying ' fickle ' ) , compounding the problem even more and all but ensuring that only the most mainstream of pop acts ascend to the upper reaches of the Hot 100 .
New bands now have to literally give their songs away in order to be heard , with little thought given to how that only further devalues their product .
The idea behind cheaper recording equipment is that it will level the playing field .
The reality behind it is that the upper class is unaffected – and in fact are getting much , much richer – while the lower class has suddenly tripled in size .
( The middle class , ironically , remains the same because it consists mostly of heritage acts who spend more time on the road than in the studio . )
And on the off chance that some unknown artist scores national attention thanks to their bedroom pop record , what is the first thing they do with their newfound name recognition ?
Sign to a major label , of course .
Not exactly the act of rebellion that home recording was supposed to inspire .
The bottom line is that music is subject to the same principles of supply and demand as everything else .
When supply goes up but demand stays the same , the value drops .
( Technically , it 's the price that 's supposed to drop , but we all know that that 's not going to happen . )
Releasing an album used to be a big deal ; it meant that you had talent – or at the very least , a marketable quality – and someone in a position of power believed in you enough to pay for your studio time .
Now , it merely means that you were able to save up a little bit of cash .
Faux celebrities
Now , before I begin an Andy Rooney - esque rant on how there is an entire class of alleged celebrities that did n't exist a few years ago , the truth is that the origins of the fake celebrity go back decades .
Tiny Tim , fake celebrity .
Morganna the Kissing Bandit , fake celebrity .
Kato Kaelin , fake celebrity .
Today , however , it is n't just that one weirdo over there that Leno cracks lazy jokes about – it's a multimillion - dollar industry … and for what , exactly ?
I still do n't quite understand why they matter .
Perhaps the most galling thing about this new wave of fake celebritydom is that a sex tape actually serves as a legitimate résumé in some cases .
Call it the Tommy Lee Effect , ( with a nod to Chuck Klosterman ) ; no one thought of Lee as a celebrity until his video with Pamela Anderson made the rounds .
He was just the drummer for Motley Crue .
That tape , however , made him a household name , and would you look at that , suddenly Poison 's Bret Michaels had a tape on the market soon after .
Now that fake celebrity has gone supernova , both have their own reality shows , long after their bands held any chart significance .
But here 's the difference between Lee and Michaels and people like , say , Kim Kardashian ( And if the writer of The Superficial is telling the truth , her sex tape shows her getting peed on , ewwww ) : Lee and Michaels had actually done something with their lives long before their tapes surfaced .
Kardashian was just a privileged party girl who hung out with fellow privileged party girl Paris Hilton .
Neither Kardashian nor Hilton possesses any discernible talent ; they just come from money .
Which is a pretty sweet gig if you 're lucky enough to be born into it , but it does n't merit them their own show , lingerie lines , or fragrances .
And it sure as hell does n't make them role models .
And yet , people look up to them .
People care about their love lives , despite the fact that a good chunk of what people read about these people in the gossip magazines is storyboarded in advance .
Supermodels have blue collar work ethics in comparison to the vapidity that is the lives of Tila Tequila or Spencer Pratt .
But as we continue to chase that intangible American Dream – which seems to have something to do with owning a bunch of expensive stuff – people like Tila and Spencer are pioneers of sorts .
In order to be famous ; you merely need to have the kind of personality that makes for good television .
( And by ' good television , ' we mean awful , awful television . )
The more self - absorbed , emotionally unstable and immature , the better .
Take a look at that again .
These people are spoiled , immature , empty shells … and they 're famous because of it .
Man , does that send a horrible message to the youth of America , and worse , if the comments I 've read on our blogs are any indication , this message is gaining more traction than I would like .
Fame appears to be the only thing that matters , and if you are n't famous , you 're nobody .
Wrong .
Fame does not make someone significant , and lack of fame does not make someone irrelevant .
What do you want on your headstone , " Beloved husband , father and brother , " or " Once famous for doing nothing " ?
If Spencer Pratt dies tomorrow , he 's getting the latter .
That is no way to live your life , people .
And while we 're discussing blog comments …
The invention of the comment section
I should be more specific .
I actually do n't have a problem with the ability to leave a comment on someone 's post , since a little healthy debate is never a bad thing .
( The comment section at Hot Chicks with Douchebags , for example , contains some of the finest creative writing the Web has to offer .
Seriously . )
I do , however , have a problem with people who no longer feel it necessary to filter their thoughts before posting them for the world to see .
Would you , for example , say any of the following things to someone if you were standing in front of them ?
( Note :
These comments were taken directly from various blogs , including one of our own . )
" Do the world a favor you obvious proof of Cranial Liposuction abuse , and slit your throat . "
" You fail at life . "
" Find something better to do with your time because you suck here . "
Answer : of course not , because you 'd get your ass kicked .
Ah , but behind a computer screen , everyone 's a tough guy – especially now that they have the option to remain anonymous – and they can say whatever vicious , belligerent and hateful nonsense that enters their puny little heads .
Oftentimes the hatred is so over the top that it 's funny , because the author has no idea how counterproductive his comment is .
In fact , as a public service , I 've come up with a helpful translator for the most cliché , overused expressions in comment sections .
Think you 're putting someone down ?
Guess again .
Frequently used expression –
What it really means
' You 're just jealous ' – I am insanely jealous of this artist 's talent .
I worship them , and wish I could be the air that they breathe .
' You 're a hater ' – I have completely lost any and all objectivity when it comes to this artist 's strengths and weaknesses .
If they told me to slaughter children and puppies , I 'd do it without a moment 's hesitation .
' Get your facts straight ' – I 'm deeply insecure , and the fact that you do n't think exactly the same way I do is giving me a panic attack .
As a means of getting even , I 'm going to nitpick this one little thing you said even though , in the end , it proves nothing .
' No one cares about you or what you think ' – I care deeply about what you think , otherwise I would n't be writing you .
' This is the dumbest thing I have ever read ' – I do n't read much .
And I 'm prone to using hyperbole when I type .
' You have no idea what you 're talking about ' – Your point of view has shaken my belief system to its core .
One day , I 'll thank you for this .
' You just do n't get it ' – You have much more discriminating tastes than I do .
' You have no sense of humor ' – I like fart jokes and shots to the groin .
' How many albums have YOU sold ? ' –
Even I know that this is a shit argument , since this line of logic also suggests that McDonald 's makes the best hamburgers because they 've sold the most , but it 's all I 've got .
' You need to shut up . ' –
Do n't bother pointing out the hypocrisy of me using my right to free speech in order to tell you that you have no right to yours .
It will only be lost on me .
' You suck ' – I 'm not smart enough to come up with anything better than this .
' Are you drunk ? ' – I 'm drunk .
' You fail at life ' – My girlfriend broke up with me .
I 'm so lonely .
What a lot of people do n't realize is that the comments people leave on blogs provide detailed descriptions of the age , education , and upbringing of the person writing them , even if it 's done anonymously .
The word ' hater , ' for example , immediately puts the commenter at 25 years of age or younger ( If you 're older than 25 and use that phrase on blogs , well , you have bigger problems than your blogging etiquette ) .
It also suggests a complete lack of emotional growth , so if you want to show the world how immature you are , then ' hater ' is the word for you .
And here 's the other thing : for the most part , there is nothing you can say that will actually upset or anger the author of the piece you 're commenting on anyway .
Music critics do n't care whether you disagree with them or not , so do n't waste your time telling them how " wrong " they are .
Political bloggers , meanwhile , are trying to offend people who disagree with them , much like fundamentalist preachers on college campuses .
If you ignore them , eventually they will go away .
In all seriousness , here is the one piece of advice that I 'd like to impart to anyone who 's head over heels in love with a band and absolutely cannot tolerate a dissenting opinion on their awesomeness : take a deep breath .
Love your favorite bands the same way you love your favorite people ;
Get to know them inside and out , seek out their weaknesses … and love them anyway .
That is the best fan that any band could possibly ask for , because every band has flaws , and every band has detractors … including yours .
Deal with it .
Whenever you lash out at someone for not liking your favorite band , you 're actually making the band look worse , because people will read your comment and think , " Man ( insert band name here ) 's fans are fucking sissies . "
Remember , what you write in a comment section says nothing about the person you 're attacking , but it says everything about you .
And if it's an anonymous comment , it comes with a giant ' I 'M A COWARD ' stamped at the top .
THE FIVE GOOD THINGS
The decade was n't all misery and despair , though .
I 've now been married to the same wonderful woman for ten years , and despite my opinion that the music business has gone to complete and utter shit , some of my all - time favorite albums are from this decade .
In other words , beauty is indeed where you find it .
Here are the things that I will remember most fondly .
Facebook
The college kids may have run for the hills once their social networking tool was co-opted by their aunts , uncles and parents , but Facebook has done wonders in terms of keeping me in touch with old friends from out of town and sharing a laugh .
Yes , it 's abused just like any networking tool is – I 've had it with Farmville and Mafia Wars , and when you send out a status update inquiring about turning your profile friends into fans , you 've officially gone too far – but it's an extremely effective way to share news and pictures with friends and family .
We 'll see exactly where they take the cryptic language involving their ownership of their members ' pictures , but for now they seem to be a benevolent overlord who allows people to play old NES games through them .
Now , if you 'll excuse me , it 's time for another game of " Snake , Rattle and Roll . "
The Kaiser Chiefs
They did n't make my favorite album of the decade ( that would be Twin Cinema by the New Pornographers ) , nor were they the band I was most passionate about ( that would be Muse ) , but there is n't a band alive that makes me happier than the Kaiser Chiefs .
With their giant hooks , boundless energy , a style that filters the full spectrum of British pop , and one of the best front men in all of rock ( Ricky Wilson , take a bow ) , the Kaiser Chiefs feel like they were made especially for me , as if I dreamed them up , and then they came true .
They also put on two of the greatest live performances I 've ever seen , at the 2005 and 2009 Lollapaloozas .
Ricky even had a broken rib at the latter show , though you never would have known it .
It used to make me angry that the Chiefs have n't made more headway in the States , but those bands that get saddled with the " too British " tag all have that problem , and must settle for cult status ( Blur , Pulp , Supergrass , The Jam , Madness ) .
Having said that , they made a lot of fans at Lolla this year ; I was talking to guys who came to see Tool and Jane 's Addiction , big muscle - bound hard rock guys , and they were blown away by the Kaiser Chiefs .
They surely made a bunch more fans opening for Green Day .
And how is the band going to celebrate this shift in momentum ?
By taking some time off , ugh .
So the band may never become superstars , but I just know that I 'll be playing these albums 20 years from now , something I suspect will not be said often about the bands that came to prominence this decade .
Getting to do what I love for a living
Let this be a lesson to anyone who 's hemming and hawing over attending their next high school reunion : for God 's sake , GO .
I skipped my five - year reunion because I had just graduated from college and had n't done anything with my life yet .
I missed the ten - year because I already had travel plans the week before and could n't really swing back - to - back trips .
But I went to the 15 - year reunion , and was stunned at how excited people were to see each other .
I was set to play golf with four old friends , one of whom was a big music geek like me .
As we got to talking on the back nine , he told me that he wrote for a web site called Bullz - Eye .
( This was in 2001 , for those keeping score at home . )
I was just publishing my reviews on my own ( totally ignored ) site and through an email list , so I was insanely jealous .
He gave me the president 's name and email , and so I dropped him a line .
He hooked me up with the editor , and they put me to work popping out this or that movie or music review .
That led to a writing gig with PopMatters , which led to a gig with the Chicago paper RedEye .
When the wife and I decided to move back to my hometown in 2005 in order to start a family , and I was having trouble finding work , the BE managing editor said , " Why do n't you come work for us ? "
And I said , " Okay . "
And none of it would have happened if I had n't attended my 15 - year high school reunion .
Thank you , Red Rocker .
I am forever in your debt .
Interviewing boyhood idol John Taylor of Duran Duran
This story is equal parts awesome and humiliating .
It 's been almost five years , so I think enough time has passed that the truth can come out : the recording of the interview was stolen before I had a chance to transcribe it .
Here 's the back story : in the spring of 2005 , just before coming on full - time for Bullz - Eye , I was a consultant for a brokerage firm in Baltimore by day and doing the music thing at night .
One day I received an email from PopMatters ' interview coordinator that , miracle of miracles , they scored a slot with Duran Duran bassist John Taylor , a guy whom I did n't just admire as a teenager – I wanted to be John Taylor .
Even better , the band was supporting one of their best efforts in years , the 2004 Fab Five reunion Astronaut .
Whew , I would n't be forced to ask pleasantly - worded questions about an album I thought was crap , like , say , their previous album Pop Trash .
( I tried two years later to score another interview with someone from the band when they released Red Carpet Massacre , but apparently my two - and - a - half - star review took me out of the running .
Oh well . )
So I buy a handheld tape recorder , cassette and phone adapter ( had to get a cab , and ask the cabbie to wait in the parking lot while I ran in to buy everything ) .
The device I bought to connect the recorder to the phone did n't work , so I had to commandeer a nearby conference room and put John on speaker , ugh .
John 's running a little late – 30 minutes , if memory serves – and by the time I get him on the phone , he 's clearly tired of doing press .
( Hey , he was being patched in from Vegas ; I would n't want to be trapped in a hotel room talking to reporters if I were in Vegas , either . )
The best answers I get are to the most routine questions , and he was n't at all afraid to voice his disapproval when I said something he did n't like .
Still , by the time we wrap up , he 's invited me to meet the band before their upcoming concert in my hometown ( which their management completely botched , but that 's another story ) , so I felt pretty good about the interview overall .
I listened to the tape five or six times while walking around Inner Harbor , still stunned that the interview actually happened .
I packed up my stuff when the work week was done and got ready to hop in a cab for the airport .
My carry - on bag was stuffed to the gills , so in my haste , I threw the tape recorder in a side pocket in my suitcase , thinking , " In this age of iPods and camcorders , who 's going to care about a Walkman ? "
Boy , did the baggage handlers at BWI show me .
I get home , and I 'm already in a foul mood because my wife and I had been fighting ( being out of town four days a week for months on end will do that ) , and so I was near tears when I discovered that my tape recorder had been stolen out of my bag …and the tape was still in it .
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck !
So I put the interview together from memory .
That 's why all of John 's answers are so brief .
He talked at length about Bob Dylan 's most recent book , but since I could n't remember that part very well , I left it out .
( You can read the interview here . )
The responses to the interview were very nice , but I never shook the embarrassment that I felt for letting that tape get stolen in the first place .
Still , the shame does n't overshadow what an incredible thrill that was .
I 've done many more interviews since then , but John 's still the biggest star I 've talked to .
The band recently finished their thirteenth album , with producer and DKNY spokesperson Mark Ronson at the helm .
It 's gotta be better than Red Carpet Massacre .
Maybe I 'll request a chat with Nick this time around .
And then store the recording on my external hard drive the second it 's over .
The births of my children
I 'm guessing you all just went , " Lame ! " Yeah , well , fuck you , they 're my kids .
Granted , this has nothing to do with the events or technological advances of the decade , but the years 2007 and 2009 will forever be fond ones for the simple fact that I got to say hi to my son and daughter , respectively , for the first time .
I thoroughly enjoyed my kid - free years , but I can't imagine life without them now .
All of the clichés about becoming a parent are absolutely true .
You never stop worrying about them .
You watch movies and listen to music in a completely different way .
( Language ! Violence !
Encourages bad behavior ! )
Perhaps the most surprising thing about parenthood was how it affected my tastes when it came to movies .
My friends would all tell me that they do n't go for the serious stuff , that they just want to be entertained .
I could n't understand that at all at the time , but I sure as hell get it now .
And worse , I 'm a film critic , so I have little patience for movies where the plot revolves around the grief parents endure when their children are kidnapped or killed ( " Changeling " ) .
Besides , who would want to experience that feeling if they did n't have to ?
Anyway , raising children is not easy , of course , but there is fun to be had if you make it happen .
My son Garrett loves music – his favorite band , natch , is the Kaiser Chiefs – and my daughter Amy is the happiest baby you 'll ever meet .
And since I work from home and they 're only in day care three days a week , I get a lot more time with them than a lot of working parents .
Yes , we 're poor , and slumming through the worst economic climate many of us have ever known , but this is as good as I 've ever had it .
Hamster hotels , you might think , are hotels for real hamsters .
In this case , however , they are hotels for people , but designed as though a hamster might live in it .
For 99 euros ( $ 147 ) a night , visitors to the hotel in Nantes , France can eat hamster chow , run in a giant wheel and sleep in hay .
They even dress up like hamsters .
It ’s known as the “ Hamster Villa ” .
Why would anyone want to live like a hamster , particularly at this price ?
Owner Yann Falquerho told Reuters , “ The Hamster in the world of children is that little cuddly animal .
Often , the adults who come here have wanted or did have hamsters when they were small . ”
Despite this , however , apparently the spartan hamster life is getting an upgrade .
A the same time , the price will rise as they will be adding wi-fi and a giant TV screen .

A voluntary recall of Tylenol Arthritis Pain Caplets is being expanded because of consumer reports of an unusual moldy odor with the 100 - count bottles , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said late on Monday .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A voluntary recall of Tylenol Arthritis Pain Caplets is being expanded because of consumer reports of an unusual moldy odor with the 100 - count bottles , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said late on Monday .
The FDA said it and Johnson & Johnson were expanding the recall to all available product lots of the pain caplets with the distinctive red EZ - open cap .
The initial recall involved five lots of the product in November after reports of an unusual musty or mildew - like odor that was associated with nausea , stomach pain , vomiting and diarrhea , the FDA said .
The agency said the odor was believed to have been caused by the breakdown of a chemical used to treat wooden pallets that transport and store packaging materials .
It said the health effects of the compound have not been well studied , but the events reported to the company have been temporary and not serious .
The FDA said consumers who bought Tylenol Arthritis Pain Caplet 100 - count bottles with the red cap from the lots included in the recall should stop using the product and contact McNeil Consumer Healthcare for a refund or replacement .

Charges filed Monday against a St. Paul Park man for his suspected 20th drunken driving offense are spurring calls for tough measures to prevent repeat offenders from getting behind the wheel .
Paul D. Garay , 55 , faces only gross misdemeanors , carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year .
Minnesota law make a fourth offense within 10 years a felony punishable by three years in prison and a fine of not less than $ 14,000 , but only two of Garay 's previous convictions occurred within the past decade , said Newport City Prosecutor Frederic ( Fritz ) Knaak .
Had Garay had three convictions within a decade , a fourth charge would have been a felony .
For Mother 's Against Drunk Drivers , his repeated violations -- the latest occurred Christmas Eve -- are clear examples of the need for mandatory drunken driving sentences that include ignition interlock devices for every convicted drunken driver .
The devices require a person to blow into them periodically ; if alcohol is detected the car will not start or continue running .
" It 's very irritating that the law has not caught up to folks like this , " said Lynne Goughler of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers in Minnesota .
" It 's scary .
He 's not done harm to anyone else , or property , just to himself .
But the odds are that he will at some point hurt somebody , or drive into their property . "
James Backstrom , Dakota County attorney and an advocate for tougher drunken driving laws , agreed .
" Someone with 19 DWIs certainly should be charged with a felony , regardless of how many occurred in the last 10 years , " he said Monday .
" There should be a lifetime limit to enable a felony to be charged . "
Doug Johnson , Washington County attorney , said he believes that the only way to reduce repeat drunken driving offenses is to exact hefty jail sentences for first offenses .
Johnson points to Europe , where laws are much stricter and drunken driving far less common .
PHILADELPHIA – Transport Workers Union ( TWU ) Local 234 has voted to authorized a strike at the end of this week , if continuing negotiations do not result in a contract by October 31 .
The union has worked without a contract for 8 months .
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority ( SEPTA ) had insisted on no pay raises for TWU workers for 5 years even though SEPTA has received increased funding from both the state and federal governments and ridership has increased by 30 % .
SEPTA wants to increase worker contribution to worker health coverage from 1 % to 4 % and freeze the level of pension benefits .
Local 234 President , Willie Brown said , “ This is the last week of working without a contract .
We will negotiate as long as we can . ”
TWU Local 234 represents 4,700 SEPTA employees in the city , those who drive the buses and trolley cars and operate the subway trains and those who maintain the transportation system .
Local 234 wants a 4 % salary increase each year and an increase in SEPTA ’s contribution to its members ’ pension fund .
Local 234 also wants SEPTA to stop contracting out maintenance and repair work and allow its employees to do the work .
By coincidence 2 weeks after Local 234 announced the strike authorization vote , the Philadelphia Phillies Baseball team won the National League Pennant and is now a participant in the World Series , beginning October 28th in New York .
The World Series games will be played in Philadelphia this weekend .
Neither SEPTA nor the city would like to see negative publicity and the disruption a strike would cause for the 5,000 – 8,000 fans expected to attend .
SEPTA spokesman , Richard Maloney said , “ Our focus is on the 1 million riders who go to work daily not the baseball fans . ”
Local 234 also represents more than 600 SEPTA workers in the surrounding counties of Philadelphia , but their contracts do not expire until April 2010 .
The last time TWU Local 234 went on strike was in 2005 .
“ SEPTA ran a campaign against the union in 2005 ” said Local 234 president , Willie Brown .
“ The inconvenience a strike creates is not the fault of the hard working bus drivers and subway workers , but rather the greedy management . ”
“ Like everyone else , we ’re hoping they reach an agreement , ” said Rina Cutler , the city ’s Deputy Mayor for transportation .

The army have been fighting northern rebels since 2004
Rebels in northern Yemen say they have clashed with Saudi forces at the site of building work for a fence along the border between the two countries .
A statement on the rebels ' website said there were a number of deaths and injuries on both sides .
There was no immediate response from Saudi authorities .
The rebels , known as Houthis , say they are fighting discrimination in Yemen and accuse Saudi Arabia of supporting the Yemeni government .
The group accused Saudi forces of firing on them in the same area on Monday in support of a Yemeni government offensive .
A Yemeni government official told AP news agency that the claim of Saudi involvement in the ongoing conflict was a lie .
The rebels condemned the building of the barrier on the Saudi border : " Residents of the area reject any fence which would have a negative economic impact on them and cut them off from their brethren on the other side , " the statement said .
New wave
Yemeni officials accuse the rebels in the north of the country of wanting to re-establish Shia clerical rule , and of receiving support from Iran .
Houthi rebels say they want greater autonomy and a greater role for their version of Shia Islam .
They complain that their community is discriminated against .
Earlier in the week , 10 rebels captured in 2008 were sentenced to death .
The Zaidi Shia community are a minority in Yemen but make up the majority in the north of the country .
The insurgents first took up arms against the government in 2004 .
The government launched a fresh offensive in August 2009 which has precipitated a new wave of intense fighting .
Aid agencies say tens of thousands of people have been displaced .
A pioneer of television evangelism , Oral Roberts , has died at Newport Beach in California aged 91 .
He founded his own ministry and his own university , funded by millions he raised from supporters .
His oratorical skills were honed by travelling around the United States with a huge mobile tent in the style of an earlier generation of frontier preachers .
He regularly spoke of visions and commands from God .
In 1987 he issued what some interpreted as an ultimatum to sympathisers to donate $ 8 m or he would die – as he put it , God would " call me home " .
It worked : he raised more than $ 9 m .
The evangelist 's latter years were marred by scandal , most revolving round his son , Richard , who inherited his mantle and was at his bedside yesterday , after Roberts had a fall at the weekend and caught pneumonia leading to his death .
Roberts was born a minister 's son in Oklahoma .
After leaving university without a degree , he embarked on crusades with a tent holding up to 3,000 .
As his reputation grew , he left the Pentecostals to establish the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association .
He made his TV debut in 1955 , and attracted a vast following .
In 1963 , he set up the Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma , which forbade students to drink , smoke or have sex before marriage .
The Catholic League has fired a broadside against animal rights outfit PETA after the campaigning organisation decided to ask Playboy model and Dancing With The Stars contestant Joanna Krupa to whip off her kit in defence of homeless mutts :
The image - which clearly demonstrates Krupa sports no fur whatsoever - is a follow - up to a Thanksgiving Be an Angel for Animals poster which featured the model " naked from the waist up holding a dog and a rosary " .
Catholic League prez Bill Donohue let rip in a statement on Tuesday in which he accused PETA of " cheap irreligious scams " .
He claimed that PETA actully kills " 95 per cent of the adoptable pets in its care " and that cats and dogs are " a lot safer in pet stores than they are in the hands of PETA employees " .
He concluded : " PETA is a fraud .
It also has a long and disgraceful record of exploiting Christian and Jewish themes to hawk its ugly services .
Those who support this organization sorely need a reality check .
They also need a course in Ethics 101 . "
Ms Krupa was n't going to take this lying down , and retaliated : " As a practicing Catholic , I am shocked that the Catholic League is speaking out against my PETA ads , which I am very proud of .
I 'm doing what the Catholic Church should be doing , working to stop senseless suffering of animals , the most defenseless of God 's creations . " ®
Bootnote
A suitably shocked CNN yesterday pitted PETA spokeswoman Lisa Lange against Donohoe :
Mr Rathbun , who still believes in the practice of Scientology and the teachings of its founder , L. Ron Hubbard , said many of the allegations detailed in letters written by former Australian church members directly reflect unwritten church policies , Dr Kaye said .
Dr Kaye 's speech follows the tabling in Federal Parliament of those letters by Senator Nick Xenophon .
They accuse the church of bullying and intimidating its members , of denying access to medical treatment and of demanding that members cover up crimes .
The church 's Australian president , Vicki Dunstan , denies the claims and has accused Senator Xenophon of abusing parliamentary privilege .
She says the allegations have been invented by disgruntled '' apostates ' ' .
But according to Dr Kaye , Mr Rathbun said : '' The common big three things that they [ the Australian complainants ] are hitting on are the craziness around what is imposed on the families , including the encouragement of abortion , the incredible commercial emphasis on getting money by any means necessary and the heavy - handed tactics used to silence dissent . ''
Mr Rathbun said the church had sought to bully members of the Sea Organisation - Scientology 's 8000 - strong international leadership group , loosely comparable to a priesthood - into having abortions when Mr Miscavige banned anyone in the group from having children in about 1986 , shortly after Hubbard 's death .
Members of the Sea Org , as it is known , symbolically sign billion - year employment contracts .
'' But accidents occur and people got pregnant , '' Dr Kaye reported Mr Rathbun as saying .
'' The answer to that became , you know , people began to encourage people to have abortions … '' I know at International Base [ the church 's head office in Florida ] in the late 1980s and early '90s , it was a pretty regular practice that [ pregnant ] people were told , ' do you want to let mankind down ? ' ''
Mr Miscavige thought Sea Org members would be easier to control and better able to devote long hours to fund - raising if they had no children , Mr Rathbun said , according to Dr Kaye .
Mr Rathbun also traces the culture of physical violence and intimidation raised in some of the Xenophon allegations to Mr Miscavige , Dr Kaye told Parliament .
'' In about 2000 he got more and more uncontrolled physically and was beating people regularly and assigning more and more tortuous punishments , '' Mr Rathbun says .
'' It got to the point where it was acceptable up there , and I think it rolled down to the other churches …
I received reports that it was happening at the continental bases like Australia and England and South Africa , and it became part of church culture . ''
Mr Rathbun even admits to assaulting Mike Rinder , the organisation 's Australian - born head of communications , who also defected .
'' It became a culture .
I am no angel , I participated .
On two occasions I beat Mike up .
You know , it was a fight .
It was n't like a smackdown , you know , where Miscavige comes in and you can't do anything .
He fought back but I am a bigger guy and it is something that I regretted . ''
Mike Rinder declined to be interviewed for this story .
However , in previous public statements he has confirmed the story .
According to Dr Kaye , Mr Rathbun said the church had become ever more obsessed with raising money .
He estimates that when he left the organisation in 2004 the church had a ' ' war chest ' ' of about $ 750 million set aside to fight off attacks from legislators or media organisations .
'' A lot of people are under so much pressure to increase the sums of their donations that they took huge risks in business or in finance so a lot of people are having personal catastrophes now .
Loans are being called in , values of things they invest in have crashed , '' Dr Kaye reported Mr Rathbun as saying .
It had become common practice to demand employees work 70 or 80 hours a week for as little as $ 50 pay .
According to Dr Kaye , Mr Rathbun said the church used various methods to silence dissent in its flock .
'' One is disconnection from family , '' he explains .
'' If I declare you a ' suppressive person ' , if I expel you , you are never going to be able to talk to your family again .
'' Two is your business career , because you lose your network .
'' And three is , you are never ever going to be able to get to the holy grail in Scientology and reach spiritual enlightenment because you are expelled .
That is three big clubs , and they are being used , increasingly , to extract ever larger and larger sums from people .
I do n't know what happened in Australia , but I am telling you that it would have stemmed from the phenomenon I observed .
It is consistent with that and it has rolled down from the top . ''
Ms Dunstan denies Mr Rathbun 's accusations , describing him as a bitter liar with an axe to grind ever since he was dismissed from the church for '' gross breach of duties ' ' .
Dr Kaye called on the two main parties to support Senator Xenophon 's call for an inquiry into the church .
'' These explosive revelations underline the urgency of investigating the operations of the Church of Scientology in Australia .
It is possible that recognising the organisation as a religion was a grave mistake that has granted legitimacy to a cult that bullies , intimidate and exploits , '' he said .
Loading '' There is a growing case for comprehensive examination not only of the church leadership in Australia but also of the church itself as a religion . '' investigations@smh.com.au
I 've been looking for this game for years !
I remembered playing it , and that it was a Japanese game show , but all i could find was the " above average guy " .
That is until now .
Not gonna lose track of it anymore .
Many Pakistanis blame others for the country 's problems
Guest columnist Ahmed Rashid reports on how the real problems facing Pakistan are being sidelined by a surge of conspiracy theories .
Switch on any of the dozens of satellite news channels now available in Pakistan .
You will be bombarded with talk show hosts who are mostly obsessed with demonising the elected government , trying to convince viewers of global conspiracies against Pakistan led by India and the United States or insisting that the recent campaign of suicide bomb blasts around the country is being orchestrated by foreigners rather than local militants .
Viewers may well ask where is the passionate debate about the real issues that people face - the crumbling economy , joblessness , the rising cost of living , crime and the lack of investment in health and education or settling the long - running insurgency in Balochistan province .
The principal obsession is when and how President Asif Ali Zardari will be replaced or sacked
Send your views on this column
The answer is nowhere .
One notable channel which also owns newspapers has taken it upon itself to topple the elected government .
Another insists that it will never air anything that is sympathetic to India , while all of them bring on pundits - often retired hardline diplomats , bureaucrats or retired Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) officers who sport Taliban - style beards and give viewers loud , angry crash courses in anti-Westernism and anti-Indianism , thereby reinforcing views already held by many .
Collapse of confidence Pakistan is going through a multi-dimensional series of crises and a collapse of public confidence in the state .
Suicide bombers strike almost daily and the economic meltdown just seems to get worse .
But this is rarely apparent in the media , bar a handful of liberal commentators who try and give a more balanced and intellectual understanding by pulling all the problems together .
The media debate ' misses real Pakistani life '
The explosion in TV channels in Urdu , English and regional languages has brought to the fore large numbers of largely untrained , semi-educated and unworldly TV talk show hosts and journalists who deem it necessary to win viewership at a time of an acute advertising crunch , by being more outrageous and sensational than the next channel .
On any given issue the public barely learns anything new nor is it presented with all sides of the argument .
Every talk show host seems to have his own agenda and his guests reflect that agenda rather than offer alternative policies .
Recently , one senior retired army officer claimed that Hakimullah Mehsud - the leader of the Pakistani Taliban which is fighting the army in South Waziristan and has killed hundreds in daily suicide bombings in the past five weeks - had been whisked to safety in a US helicopter to the American - run Bagram airbase in Afghanistan .
In other words the Pakistani Taliban are American stooges , even as the same pundits admit that US - fired drone missiles are targeting the Pakistani Taliban in Waziristan .
These are just the kind of blatantly contradictory and nut - case conspiracy theories that get enormous traction on TV channels and in the media - especially when voiced by such senior former officials .
The explosion in civil society and pro-democracy movements that brought the former military regime of President Pervez Musharraf to its knees over two years has become divided , dissipated and confused about its aims and intentions .
Troops and militants are fighting in South Waziristan Even when such activists do appear on TV , their voices are drowned out by the conspiracy theorists who insist that every one of Pakistan 's ills are there because of interference by the US , India , Israel and Afghanistan .
The army has not helped by constantly insisting that the vicious Pakistani Taliban campaign to topple the state and install an Islamic emirate is not a local campaign waged by dozens of extremist groups , some of whom were trained by the military in the 1990s , but the result of foreign conspiracies .
Economic crisis
Such statements by the military hardly do justice to the hundreds of young soldiers who are laying down their lives to fight the Taliban extremists .
Nor has the elected government of the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) tried to alter the balance , as it is mired in ineffective governance and widespread corruption while failing to tackle the economic recession , that is admittedly partly beyond its control .
Moreover the PPP has no talking pundits , sympathetic talk show hosts or a half decent media management campaign to refute the lies and innuendo that much of the media is now spewing out .
At present , the principal obsession is when and how President Asif Ali Zardari will be replaced or sacked , although there is no apparent constitutional course available to get rid of him except for a military coup , which is unlikely .
The campaign waged by some politicians and parts of the media - with underlying pressure from the army - is all about trying to build public opinion to make Mr Zardari 's tenure untenable .
Pakistan is caught in a spiral of violence Nobody discusses the failure of the education system that is now turning out hundreds of suicide bombers , rather than doctors and engineers .
Or the collapsing and corrupt national health system that forces the poorest to seek expensive private medical treatment , or the explosion in crime or suicides by failed farmers and workers who have lost their jobs .
Pakistan cannot tackle its real problems unless the country 's leaders - military and civilian - first admit that much of the present crisis is a result of long - standing mistakes , the lack of democracy , the failure to strengthen civic institutions and the lack of investment in public services like education , even as there continues to be a massive investment in nuclear weapons and the military .
Pakistan 's crisis must first be acknowledged by officialdom and the media before solutions can be found .
The alternative is a continuation of the present paralysis where people are left confused , demoralised and angry .
Ahmed Rashid is the author of the best - selling book Taliban and , most recently , of Descent into Chaos :
How the war against Islamic extremism is being lost in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Central Asia .
Here is a selection of your comments : Ahmed Rashid may be right in saying that conspiracy theories abound in Pakistan .
I would however request him to explain a few observations .
First , how do these Pakistani Taliban manage to deploy anti-aircraft and other heavy weapons and pay $ 40 per day to their soldiers if they have no external government or external secret agency support ?
Secondly , why are they targeting specific political parties while other right - wing and religious extremist parties hold rallies freely ?
Surely somebody is supporting them .
Will Mr Rashid kindly comment ?
Farrukh Chowdry , Adelaide , Australia
It 's refreshing to know there are still intellectuals in modern Pakistan who know the truth and have the daring to speak it out loud .
On the other hand , it 's such a shame that Pakistanis have been fed a diet of lies that no wonder they are so puzzled and confused about whom to trust .
I do n't think that it would be any exaggeration to say that the Pakistani establishment has not only been inspired by Josef Goebbels , Hitler 's propaganda minister , but also have managed to outdo him .
Now we can say that " government could fool all the people all the time " .
Anupam Gupta , Newcastle , UK I find this article fascinating .
But I will raise one point here .
I have been a close observer of Indian news channels in the past and have seen similar accounts .
My understanding is that Pakistan is now becoming a nation which has really started to think , and this has happened after the explosion of TV channels .
Though I agree that some channels are playing a negative role from government point of view but in the end it does represent the views of Pakistani people .
I see positive coming out of this complete mess .
It has been a few years since Pakistani media got real freedom and they have a lot to learn .
And they acknowledge this fact .
Let 's make this world a happy place for our generations to come .
Umar Butt , Lahore , Pakistan Finally one article that narrates the problem with Pakistani people .
Whenever I 'm browsing through the channels on Sky and come across a Pakistani channel , I 'm most certain to see a debate or discussion on Islam or a discussion on the American and Indian - sponsored Pakistani Taliban .
The Pakistani people clearly live in a state of denial .
And the statements from their foreign secretary or ministers blaming US and India for the country 's misfortune just add up to this sorry state of affairs .
If ever there is a single clue to Indian government sponsoring Pakistani Taliban , the Indian government may be forced to resign the very next day .
It 's hard to imagine Pakistan was once a part of greater India .
If anyone has to study the effects of democracy and secularism on a nation , look no further than 65 years of history of India and Pakistan .
One started out as a confused republic with no clear demarcation between state and religion , the other with a stable , impartial constitution and the difference it made in 65 years is for all to see .
Harsha , London
The author seems quite ill informed and biased .
His lack of intellectual honesty shows through in many of his comments , specially his reference to a " retired senior army officer " claiming that Hakimullah Mehsud has been whisked to safety by the Americans .
This " officer " is none other than General Mirza Aslam Beg , the Commander - in - Chief of Pakistan Army from 1988 to 1992 .
He enjoys considerable prestige and is acknowledged to have reliable contacts in the army and elsewhere .
His claim is that the US has been playing a double game against Pakistan which , I think , is apparent from the chain of events over the past few years and the mass of evidence unearthed by the Pakistan army this year .
That Pakistan is entitled to pursue policies that are in its own interests is a sentiment that is beyond the comprehension of people like Ahmed Rashid .
The US is pursuing its own interests in Central Asia - what is good for it is not necessarily good for Pakistan .
And vice versa .
Of the key personalities in Pakistan who have a hand on the reins of power , only General Kayani seems to understand this .
But his freedom of action appears to be limited .
Sakib Ahmad , UK Good to see Ahmed Rashid finally extending his criticism from Pakistan army - only to highly immature Pakistani television media and leadership - deficient , non-serious , and incapable civil government .
If the civil government shows strong leadership and capability , the Army will never dare to interfere .
Zafar , Sydney , Australia
He does n't even have a clue on what he is talking about .
For the first time in Pakistan 's history , media is free and people have the right to make their own views about what is going on .
Anyways , these are just my views and I am not surprised how he became the author of the best - seller book .
I am also not surprised why you guys choose to publish this article .
Akram , NYC , USA Ahmed Rashid is among a dwindling number of wise people in Pakistan whose voices are being drowned out by a rising , shrill cacophony of madness .
The state of affairs in Pakistan reminds me of Picasso's Guernica - which is what all of Pakistan appears to have become .
And , sadly , we know how long that particular internal strife took to play out .
The world 's first ostensibly modern Islamic state , carved out of India on the basis of religion , has become its most pathetic , held together tenuously only by a hatred of ' the other ' that is systematically nurtured by the establishment , read the military .
Pakistan 's men in uniform are long embittered by their failure to achieve martial greatness despite their tribal self - image of invincibility - an image that they derive curiously not from Pakistani culture , but from Afghan warriors like the Ghoris and Ghaznavis , after whom they name Pakistan 's spanking new missiles and other new weaponry built using a barter system with North Korea .
And that is where Pakistan 's real problem lies : a fundamentalist military that is adept at buying time for itself using the currency of hatred .
That toxic cache will run out some day , hopefully sooner rather than later .
And that day Pakistan will be reborn among the comity of the world 's great nations .
Tony Gill , Sydney , Australia
What does 60 + years of conspiracy theories give you ?
More conspiracy theories .
If they hate the US they should also learn to hate the US dollar ... and then they can debate in their TV shows - what kills more Pakistanis ?
The Taliban or hunger ?
I do believe , beggars cannot be choosers !
Hope Pakistanis see a sunny day soon .
Evo , Australia Dear Mr Ahmed Rashid , are you sure you are Pakistani ?!!!??
Is any part of you Pakistani at all ?!!
When was the last time you even set foot in this country ?!!
You have absolutely no idea what is happening in this country , no wonder the Afghan strategy in Afghanistan is failing , you do n't know the first thing about Pakistan .
You are merely mouthing the kind of biased over - simplistic profound ignorance that Western channels regularly portray when it comes to Pakistan .
Even a kid living here can see through your rubbish .
This article is so nauseating and biased .
Allow us - the Pakistani people that certainly does n't include the likes of you - decide what is in our interests .
Zoh , Lahore , Pakistan
The description given by Mr Rashid of the state of media is true in a way .
Media is nascent in the country where it suffers a fear for its new - found independence or freedom .
Why we see only talk of Taliban and militancy on television shows is because many of the problems that the country faces today such as joblessness and lack of investment is largely due to terrorism and daily attacks in which people are being killed and businesses closed down .
But there is a growing realisation and acknowledgement in the leadership of the country that this problem can only be tackled if hearts and minds of people are won over and that can only be done by improving social indicators .
And while media is semi-educated itself , according to Mr Rashid , so is a large majority of the people in the country , and to educate them is a task that media seems to have taken upon itself .
Although time is short but give it a chance .
Waqas Rafique , Islamabad , Pakistan Pure sensationalism !
Yes , the situation on the ground is far from ideal , but it is nowhere near as desperate as the above article makes out .
As a society we are still evolving and as yet in the early stages of the maturation curve where the leadership is concerned , still caught up in its old feudal habits of bad governance and conspicuous consumption .
But , despite its best efforts , the middle class is gaining critical mass and its educated cadres are increasingly vocal in demanding level playing fields .
In this equation the Taliban have entered as a loose canon that challenges the regressive status quo and hence have found favour with the public in the past .
But the public has recognised them for what they are , a bunch of selfish savages , and they have lost its sympathy as it throws its weight behind the Pakistan army 's military operation against the Taliban .
Adil Ahmad , Karachi , Pakistan
Its ironic that this is yet again another article which does not talk about any of the issues really faced by a Pakistani today .
Like the media personalities he talks about , Ahmed Rashid himself fails to provide any substance for or against any of the arguments .
Aamir Dehlavi , Manalapan , NJ , USA I have said many times before and I 'll say it again - Pakistan 's problems are not a recent development , they are a result of 60 + years of a lack of governance , rampant corruption , brutal land lords ( feudalism ) and an over - ambitious military !
All these and more are coming home to roost !
Basically , Pakistan needs to start from the scratch , establish a comprehensive education reforms covering ALL its citizens , ABOLISH FUEDAL LANDLORDS and contain the military within its responsibilities as a security apparatus .
Get rid of the over - ambitious religious right !
Oh !
Also cross your fingers and pray like hell !
Intrepid , USA
Thanks to Ahmed Rashid for creating the picture which is almost actual .
I want to add that media is trying to direct the country without a strong / literate base of analysts .
It is not following any code of conduct which should be established as per our norms .
It is criticising the system in a way not to teach the system but only pleasing the audience without any effective policy .
As we see from here is that media in Pakistan is becoming a part of " Might is Right " like many other powers .
Deedar Hussain , Karachi & Pakistan
Thanks to Ahmed Rashid for writing a very timely and valuable piece .
Pakistan needs to understand its own social , economic , and political crisis .
The country needs to work towards building a civil society which respects democracy , secularism , and human rights , while respecting its own and its neighbour 's cultural plurality .

The polenta gives these muffins a slightly crunchy and light texture .
Sometimes I change the flavours and use ingredients that are in the fridge .
Try chopped semi-dried tomatoes and goats cheese or Kalamata olives and Feta cheese for a vegetarian option .
These muffins are very quick to make , they are perfect for breakfast or even served as a canape .
They also make a delicious lunch box alternative to ordinary sandwiches .
I love to serve them straight from the oven as I can’t control myself .
I ’m not sure if it ’s the melted cheese that gets stuck to the tray that ’s obviously the cooks privilege or if it ’s eating them .
I need to think about that a bit more so that I can make up my mind .
But in the meantime I shall help myself to another muffin .
The warm aroma of melting cheese mixed with smoky bacon is enough to make anyone salivate .
There is something magical about these Gorgonzola and smoked bacon breakfast muffins .
The tiny size allows second and third helpings , and helps soothe the guilty conscious as they are only little !
100g smoked back bacon
100g Gorgonzola cheese
175g plain flour
75g polenta
1tsp baking powder
small pinch of salt and freshly cracked black pepper
1tsp chopped mixed soft herbs ( such as chives , parsley and basil )
50g melted butter
150 ml full fat milk
1 whole egg
smoked paprika for dusting
Preheat the oven to 200 °C and grease the chosen muffin moulds , I used a flexible oven safe rubber mould with each hole measuring 5 cm wide x 3 cm high .
Cut the bacon in 5 mm dice ; heat a non stick frying pan and sauté the bacon until golden brown and cooked .
Set aside and let the bacon cool completely .
Weigh the flour , polenta , baking powder a very small pinch of salt and a grinding of black pepper in to a mixing bowl .
Chop the chosen soft herbs and add to the flour .
Crumb the Gorgonzola between your fingers and add to the flour .
Stir to coat the cheese with the flour it helps to separate the cheese and it does not all get stuck together in a lump .
Drain the cooked bacon on kitchen paper and add to the flour mixture .
Melt the butter ; add the milk and the egg whisk vigorously for a minute .
Add the egg mixture to the flour , stir to mix , do not over work the mix , the secret for light muffins is do not to mix it too much .
Work light and fast .
Spoon the mixture in to the prepared moulds , fill them to the top as they do not rise much , just a bit of a puff .
Place the tray on the middle shelf of the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes .
Once the muffins are cooked , remove the tray from the oven and dust it lightly with smoked paprika .
Turn the muffins out on to a cooking rack and let them cool slightly before serving .
Makes 15 x 5 cm wide small muffins
Food Fanatics Tips
I am a great believer that cooks should use their own initiative to adjust recipes and experiment with different flavours .
However I have made the classic mistake with this particular recipe in the past where I have tried to add too many alternative exciting ingredients and made the muffins too greasy or heavy .
Do not be constrained by a recipe and feel free to experiment but do remember that less is more .
It ’s easy to over complicate flavours and it can ruin your dish completely .
Bear in mind that if you exchange the cheese use a cheese with a similar texture as it could make the muffins too wet if the cheese is too runny .
In Australia , a range of rugs and the different options in carpets are offered online .
There are expensive rugs , cheap cost rugs and branded rugs that people sell online .
For any kind for rugs that people are looking for Living Room Rugs , they may search out Rugs Sydney or other shops in different areas to buy Rugs Online .
The rug sellers who are selling Shag Rugs and the different styles of Moroccan Rugs may offer the various range of colors and pile styles that people may compare before they buy .
The buyers who offer Modern Rugs that include geometric shapes , odd and asymmetrical shapes and digital designs make sure to cater to all kinds of needs of buyers who are in need of unique styles and colors .
Online buyers of rugs look for all types of rugs that includes Bohemian Rugs as well as the modern sort of options like Wool Rugs and small as well as large rugs .
All these types of rugs are listed online and buyers can choose depending on the style , size and type of the rugs they need .
The three main challenges that people may have to face while buying the rugs from online sellers and rug stores .
In Australia , the material and texture of the rugs are also mentioned with the description of the rugs that are offered .
But buyers may not find it easy to sort out if the texture mentioned is the same as they expect or will it be different .
When buying via brands the options are good enough to choose but from various sellers the quality may vary .
There are Hallway Rugs that also include Jute Rugs and large sized rugs with bright as well as dull colors on it .
So for that kind of rugs you may also find it challenging that the rugs could be soft or rough and sturdy or flimsy .
The prices , sizes and sharp prints are also the key prints people search and may or may not get answers they need .
People also look for the various other options in rugs but online it is not possible to find more comparison points until and unless you can feel the rug with your hand and know the difference of the quality .
There are multiple things that make it easier for the buyers who may want to take the best but online choices may need a little bit more research and a reliable seller who can help you buy the best .
[ UPDATE 12/17/09 ]
I was contacted by phone by GamePro President Marci Hughes on December 4th .
She explained to me that there was a slip up within the company where it was believed there had been no submissions to the contest .
She was very polite and apologetic and assured me the contest entries would still be judged .
I assured her I would be happy to update this post if GamePro could clarify the situation on their developer blog .
As of today , they have done just that .
I understand that communication mistakes happen within companies , and I ’m happy to see Game Pro correct the situation .
I was very disappointed today to learn that GamePro.com has canceled its API programming contest after the entry deadline .
I submitted an entry to the contest , and since the judging results were due , I reached out to the API guys via Twitter .
Here ’s what I learned :
I ca n’t be any more clear when I say this : I and any other developer putting time and energy to create an entry for your contest were very interested .
I think GamePro should be reminded of the first rule of Open Space :
“ Whoever shows up is the right group ”
This is a fabulous example of an API vendor doing it wrong .
I love making mashups .
Experimenting with APIs is my favorite thing to do as a programmer .
They ’re like geek Lego .
One of the most exciting parts of Mashup Camp is the speed geeking contest , where developers pitch their mashup to a couple dozen small groups in hopes of winning recognition and some great prizes .
The speed geeking contest is something I look forward to participating in every time , and over the years I ’ve done well getting votes and winning prizes .
I ’ve won awards from IBM , Thomson - Reuters , Dapper , and others .
In Dublin I even managed to win the Best Mashup grand prize .
A couple times I ’ve come prepared with a mashup , but as my friend Andrew Bidochko can tell you , half of the fun is spending a sleepless night hacking away .
For API providers , sponsoring a mashup contest is a great way to stir interest in their services .
Not only do contests attract developers to using their APIs , but it helps vendors discover valuable use cases for their data .
The kind of creative use cases that clever mashup developers uncover can be invaluable to vendors .
Even simple mashups can evolve to new revenue models and uncover vertical niches not thought of by the vendor .
I would think the return on investment for running a contest , including prizes would be high .
If nothing else , you ’ll get bug reports , feedback , and dozens to hundreds of developer hours in testing your API .
For the developer , mashup contests provide a great incentive to try out an API .
If I had a choice , the only coding I would do would be mashups .
But since I was laid off in September and freelancing once again , time for the fun stuff is scarce .
That ’s why I was excited to read about the GamePro.com API contest on the best mashup news site in the world , programmableweb.com .
Programmable web has a special page for mashup contests , and I perked up a bit when I noticed GamePro was offering $ 5000 for theirs .
Now for the lowly freelancer , five grand is a nice chunk of change .
I figured there would be a decent amount of competition in this contest , but I already had a good idea for it and thought I ’d take a stab .
So , with some great help from my wife Liz and our good friend Emily with the artwork , over the course of several weeks I created Pew Pew Zap !
Pew Pew Zap ! is a devilishly cute and simple mashup using the GamePro API .
It ’s basically a ‘ hot or not ’ style site where the user is presented two games and votes on their favorite .
The games are organized by platform and genre , the end goal being that the human - powered bubble sort will eventually reveal the best game for each platform and genre as indicated by the leaderboards .
This site by no means is a great engineering feat , but I think it ’s a clever use of the GamePro API .
Additionally , I wanted to test this interaction model , as I had previously spent some time on a similar but yet unreleased mashup for Etsy .
My hypothesis being that the average page views per visitor would be high due to the simple nature of the site .
So far , I ’ve found that is the case according to my stats .
Working with the GamePro API was straight forward , although I did run into some errors with the service .
The guys at GamePro were helpful and responsive on the forum , and even answered some questions I asked via Twitter direct messages .
So a couple days before the contest deadline I submitted my mashup to GamePro , and as the now non-existent contest rules page stated , I waited 30 days to hear the results .
Suspiciously , a day or so after the November 1st entry deadline , GamePro removed all the information about the contest from their site .
Here ’s Google ’s cached version of the contest announcement .
The GamePro Terms of Service page , nor its cached version , contain the contest rules any longer .
In fact , the only mention I can find of the contest is this forum post .
I did not contact GamePro about any of this until today , trusting that there would be no issue .
I guess that ’s a lesson learned .
Regardless , I ’m glad I created the mashup .
It ended up winning Programmable Web ’s “ mashup of the day ” on November 19th .
The actions by GamePro will not discourage me from entering programming contests in the future .
I have to wonder though , how many other developers got let down on this one .
I hope the folks participating in GamePro ’s comment drawing do n’t get burned , too .
I ’m not bitter –I got to spend some time doing what I love , and was able to submit some bug reports to help GamePro improve their API .
I just do n’t think it ’s right for them to dangle a carrot .
Recently , Semenya told the Guardian , “ It ’s not so easy .
The university is O.K. but there is not many other places I can go .
People want to stare at me now .
They want to touch me .
I ’m supposed to be famous . ”
She added , “ I do n’t think I like it so much . ”
The law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf announced in September that it was taking on Caster Semenya as a client .
It is still sorting through what happened and deciding whom to sue .
One afternoon , I drove with Benedict Phiri , an associate in the firm ’s Johannesburg office , across the Blood River from Polokwane to Ga-Masehlong to meet Semenya ’s mother .
Ga-Masehlong is a small village dotted with jacaranda trees ; goats graze on the garbage and the grass on the roadsides .
The houses have tin roofs , and people put rocks on top of them to keep them from blowing away .
There are satellite dishes in several yards , but most people have dug their own wells and collect firewood from the bush for cooking .
Everyone knows everyone else in Ga-Masehlong , and it was easy to get directions to the house of the champion .
At the Semenya home , there was a flyer tacked to the front door promoting a lecture that Julius Malema was giving at the local elementary school .
Phiri knocked .
We heard shuffling and then the sound of locks turning and bolts sliding .
Phiri called out that he was Caster ’s lawyer , but nobody came to the door .
A few minutes later , a pretty girl wearing an orange fleece jacket walked into the yard and introduced herself as Maphela .
She said she was fourteen .
“ Do you want my story ? ” she asked in English .
“ I am Caster ’s sister !
But I am not like her .
I am different from Caster . ”
I asked her what she meant , and Maphela replied emphatically , “ I am not that way . ”
Maphela looked toward the window where her mother , Dorcus , was hiding her face behind the curtain and motioning vigorously for her daughter to stop speaking with us .
We asked Maphela if she would tell her mother that Phiri was Caster ’s lawyer .
Maphela ran off toward the back door .
We sat on the stoop of a cooking hut in the Semenyas ’ front yard , and waited with the chickens and the goats .
An elderly neighbor named Ike came into the yard .
“ Caster has done a wonderful thing , ” he said .
“ This has brought to mind when the Philistines were persecuting the Israelites . ”
Ike told us that he just wanted to check on the family and see how their visit from Julius Malema the previous evening had gone .
This made Phiri nervous .
After a few minutes , Maphela returned .
She told us that her mother would not meet with Phiri , because she did not agree that Caster should have a lawyer .
As we drove away through the bush , Phiri called his boss in Johannesburg , a white former rugby player named Greg Nott .
I could hear Nott yelling through the phone .
“ We knew this would happen all along , ” Phiri said , trying to calm him .
“ Julius Malema is Chuene ’s ally , and Julius is giving Caster money . ”
On the occasion of the A.N.C. Youth League ’s sixty - fifth anniversary , in October , Julius Malema presented Caster Semenya with a hundred and twenty thousand rand ( about sixteen thousand dollars ) at a gala dinner in Johannesburg .
“ I can even see it , ” Phiri said on the phone .
“ They probably told the mom , ‘ People will come and say they ’re her lawyer .
Do n’t believe it . ’ ” Phiri was afraid that Malema would step in and persuade the family to side with Chuene , who comes from the same region , and whose interests might not be served by lawyers poking around .
One of the first things that Dewey & LeBoeuf did when the firm took the case was to ask both A.S.A *.* and the I.A.A.F. to provide documentation of the tests and any other pertinent paperwork ; neither organization has fully complied .
The firm is representing Semenya pro bono , so good publicity will be its only reward .
“ And that , ” Phiri said , “ could blow up in our faces . ”
Nobody wants Chuene out of office more than an old friend and colleague named Wilfred Daniels , who started at A.S.A*.* with him , sixteen years ago .
“ From day one we connected , in the struggle days , you know ? ” Daniels said .
“ We were like , we belong together . ” Both Daniels , fifty - eight , and Chuene , fifty - seven , grew up as promising athletes who could never compete internationally because of apartheid .
They understood each other then , but not anymore .
Daniels — whom everyone calls Wilfie — is the unofficial mayor of Stellenbosch , a leafy college town in the wine country .
He likes to hold court at the Jan Cats restaurant , in front of the elegant Stellenbosch Hotel .
As he sat at his street - front table on a sunny afternoon in a green Izod jacket and track pants , drinking a bottle of Chenin blanc , every other person who passed by stopped to pay his respects , or at least waved at him driving by .
Daniels was a famous athlete in his youth , and he is even more famous now .
In early September , he resigned from A.S.A*.* in protest over its handling of Caster Semenya , and had since been in the papers constantly .
“ We allowed it , ” he said .
“ If we as management were on our game , we would ’ve objected .
We accompanied her to the slaughter .
And that is my dilemma . ”
Daniels was not directly involved in the testing or the coverup .
During the first training session in Berlin , “ while she was warming up and stretching , putting on her spikes , she told me they had done tests on her .
I said , ‘ What tests ? ’ ” Semenya told him that she did n’t know what they were for , but she described what had happened .
“ They put her feet in straps and ‘ they work down there , ’ she said .
They told her it was dope tests . ”
Semenya had undergone routine doping tests many times before .
She knew that this was something very different .
“ If you and me who come from the big cities , if we find it repulsive , I mean , what about a rural girl , ” Daniels said .
“ She does n’t know what ’s happening around her .
She ’s seven , eight months in the city now , in Pretoria , a new life altogether , and nobody takes the time to explain to her ? ”
He shook his head in disgust .
“ It was unprovoked talk , and she ’s not somebody who talks , normally .
And she spoke to me as a Colored guy , as a man , about intimate , female things .
That to me was like a cry for help . ”
The sins of A.S.A*.* , as Daniels sees it , are , first , not giving Semenya adequate information about the Pretoria tests — including her right to refuse them — and , second , not pulling her out of the competition in Berlin .
“ It ’s the day before the championships , ” Daniels said .
“ Eighteen years old , your first World Championships , the greatest race of your life .
You ca n’t focus , because you have to go for gender testing .
And you come back and you have to watch on TV : they are explaining the possibilities .
I found her in her room , sitting in front of the TV like this , ” Daniels put his hand up to his face to show how close she was to the screen .
“ And they ’re talking about her and she ’s trying to understand what they ’re saying .
Because nobody has spoken to her , to tell her , Look , this is what these tests might mean .
I felt so ashamed . ”
Daniels has worked in various capacities at A.S.A. over the years , first in management , then as a coach , and , most recently , as A.S.A *.*’s coördinator with the High Performance Centre , the program at the University of Pretoria where Semenya is now .
Daniels does not agree with the I.A.A.F.’s assessment that Semenya ’s seven - and - a - half - second improvement was “ supernatural . ”
She went from training on the dirt roads of Limpopo to a world - class facility .
She is also an extraordinarily hard worker .
“ Understand : Maria Mutola is her hero , ” Daniels said .
“ So she had wonderful goals and ideals for herself ; she was really trying to emulate her hero one day . ”
Maria Mutola is a runner from Mozambique whose event , like Semenya ’s , was the eight hundred metres .
Mutola also happened to have a strikingly masculine appearance .
Daniels believes that the best that can happen for Semenya at this point is to have a career like his .
He has travelled the world and met many of his heroes .
He has a cellar with more than two thousand bottles of red wine .
He eats his grilled springbok at Jan Cats and clearly enjoys being a local eminence .
But it is probably not the life he would have led if apartheid had n’t prevented him from competing internationally ; and it is not the life that was in front of Caster Semenya before she went to Germany .
“ I understand that her running days are over , ” Daniels said .
There ’s another scenario , in which Semenya ’s story could become one of against - all - odds victory .
The I.A.A.F. could apologize and decree Semenya female .
Kobus van der Walt , the director of sport at the High Performance Centre , pointed out that though Semenya has beaten the South African record for her event , she has n’t come anywhere near Kratochvílová ’s world record , which means that there are plenty of women with a chance of besting Semenya .
Conceivably , one day we will see Caster Semenya at the Olympics with a medal hanging from her neck .
She could be the poster child for triumphant transgression .
But that is not what Daniels thinks will happen .
“ Now her life is over , ” he said .
“ Not only as an athlete but as a human being .
Even if the I.A.A.F. says there ’s nothing wrong with her , people will always look at her twice .
There should be hell to pay for those responsible . ”
He pounded his fist on the table .
“ I ’ve got a daughter .
If that was my daughter , what would I have done as a father ?
Somebody might have been dead by now . ”
On November 5th , Chuene and the entire board of A.S.A*.* were suspended by the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee , pending an investigation into how they handled Caster Semenya .
One afternoon at the High Performance Centre , I sat up in the bleachers , killing time before a meeting with Kobus Van der Walt .
I was surrounded by a spread of neatly partitioned fields , like a Brueghel painting : there are twenty - four cricket nets , six rugby fields , twenty - two outdoor tennis courts , nine soccer fields , seven squash courts , and a track surrounded by a three - thousand - seat stadium , all kept in impeccable condition .
Runners in little packs zoomed around the fields and into the distance .
Spring sunlight flicked along the blue of the swimming pool .
A figure in a black sweatshirt with the hood up walked along the path about thirty yards in front of me .
There was something about this person ’s build and movements that drew my attention .
I got up and followed along the path , until I caught up to the person where he or she was stopped behind the cafeteria , talking to a waiter and a cook , both of whom were much shorter than she was .
It was Caster Semenya .
She wore sandals and track pants and kept her hood up .
When she shook my hand , I noticed that she had long nails .
She did n’t look like an eighteen - year - old girl , or an eighteen - year - old boy .
She looked like something else , something magnificent .
I told her I had come from New York City to write about her , and she asked me why .
“ Because you ’re the champion , ” I said .
She snorted and said , “ You make me laugh . ”
I asked her if she would talk to me , not about the tests or Chuene but about her evolution as an athlete , her progression from Limpopo to the world stage .
She shook her head vigorously .
“ No , ” she said .
“ I ca n’t talk to you .
I ca n’t talk to anyone .
I ca n’t say to anyone how I feel or what ’s in my mind . ”
I said I thought that must suck .
“ No , ” she said , very firmly .
Her voice was strong and low .
“ That does n’t suck .
It sucks when I was running and they were writing those things .
That sucked .
That is when it sucks .
Now I just have to walk away .
That ’s all I can do . ”
She smiled a small , bemused smile .
“ Walk away from all of this , maybe forever .
Now I just walk away . ”
Then she took a few steps backward , turned around , and did . ♦
The Paradise Society of a Subversive
von Diehl Ute | Oct 21 , 2009
It began with a small upholstery business in Bologna .
Dino Gavina ( 1922 to 2007 ) inherited the business from his father .
In 1955 , on the advice of Pier Giacomo Castiglioni , he put his first piece , a simple trestle table from the carpenter 's workshop , into series production .
Later , countless companies latched onto the idea and reproduced the table .
Practically all of Gavina 's furniture has either been reproduced or copied in detail .
He once remarked : " I have never patented anything " .
When I come across one of the plagiarists , I just look him straight in the eye and say ‘ you know me well do n't you ? ' "
Gavina quickly won over the elite of Italian design , including the Castiglioni brothers , Vico Magistretti , Mario Bellini , Marco Zanuso and Luigi Caccia Dominioni .
" The ones that are missing are only missing because I rejected their designs " , he said .
He became friends with the architect and furniture designer Carlo Scarpa ( 1906 to 1978 ) .
They had a common aim - to surround themselves with fewer things but of higher quality .
Wassily had a stimulating effect
Italy was only confronted with the changes associated with industrialisation at a late stage .
Solutions for series furniture production were available in the archives but they just had n't been discovered yet .
Fascinated by Marcel Breuer 's designs from the Bauhaus era , in 1962 Dino Gavina took a chair into production , which with its collapsible frame of chrome - plated stainless steel , seemed to him to be a manifestation of rationalism .
He named the bouncy chair the " Wassily " , the reason being that Breuer gave the only prototype to Wassily Kandinsky as a gift .
Today , the " Wassily " is a cult object and serves worldwide as a focus of aesthetic contemplation .
Marcel Breuer related his recollections of his first meeting with Dino Gavina , the ‘ most impulsive , emotional furniture manufacturer in the world ' as follows : " One day , in the early sixties , a small , thin , lively Italian with a piercing , observant eye visited me in my New York office .
He spoke neither German nor English but I understood that he wanted my furniture designs from the 1920s .
We agreed immediately . "
Gavina was the first to manufacture Breuer 's chairs , stools and tables .
The steel tube " backlegless " chair from the series is more widespread worldwide than any other chair .
Gavina 's initiative definitely set an important example .
Breuer 's standardised furniture parts kickstarted Italian design production .
Moreover , designers learnt from the " Wassily " .
But the success the furniture of the Bauhaus master achieved also encouraged the indiscriminate resurgence of other classics .
Gavina got hot under the collar on more than one occasion about this ‘ pernicious fashion ' .
In his office in Bologna stood the ‘ fauteuil grand comfort ' by Le Corbusier , as a deterring example as it were : " welding different metals together in twenty - two places is crazy for a factory - made product " , he said .
He even found a weakness in the much vaunted ‘ Barcelona Chair ' by Mies van der Rohe .
" The way the legs cross is bungled . "
He said he has declined an offer to make Le Corbusier 's furniture , even though it would have earned him a great deal of money .
Then there was Flos
In 1960 Gavina and his production site moved from Bologna to Foligno in Umbria .
Pier Giacomo Castiglioni designed the factory and management offices , the elegance of which , even today , seems totally out of place surrounded by anonymous industrial buildings .
The Company President of Gavina was Carlo Scarpa .
Artists like Lucio Fontana and Gino Marotta worked out of the factory .
Local businesses experienced an upturn thanks to the manufacture of steel tubing , chromium plating and sewing covers for Breuer furniture .
In Umbria , many of the older generation still remember Gavina , whose aim was to generate enthusiasm among all its employees for its aesthetic mission .
Two years after the move , he set up the lighting factory Flos , which Pier Giacomo Castiglioni helped to make a success with his fantastic ideas .
For example , with his brother Achille , he built his Toio lamps from a car headlamp , a transformer and fishing rod components and designed the quirky Arco arc lamp .
Gavina wanted even more lighting and set the Sirrah company on a new course .
For this , Kazuhide Takahama from Japan , developed a lighting range featuring metal structures covered in white .
In 1963 Dino Gavina opened his new salesroom in the Via Condotti in Rome .
Back then , his business premises in Bologna were furnished by Carlo Scarpa .
Today it 's a listed building and a destination for students of architecture from around the world .
Surprisingly , customers did n't find any furniture there , only Marcel Duchamp and a range of his ready - mades , which no - one had ever seen before .
This was Gavina 's way of turning his subsidiaries into cultural venues .
He was constantly experimenting , thus pre-empting much of what Prada stores in Soho and Tokyo now claim , in terms of range .
A Weak State
In 1968 , Gavina was dealt a severe blow .
Public money had been invested in his public limited company Gavina and state corporation ISAP pressed for the post of director to be filled by a protégé , who sexually assaulted a minor When Gavina demanded his dismissal , he was subjected to powerful political pressure , which left him no choice , if he did n't want to lose face .
He had to sell 100 % of the business .
He did n't like talking about it but when you managed to get something out of him , the fury he had felt back then , that the Italian state had not prevented the break up of his company , resurfaced .
" I threw twenty years of my life away " , he said .
The buyers were Knoll International and the American group 's first decision was to fire Carlo Scarpa .
With the takeover , all the glorious designs , Kazuhide Takahama and Tobia Scarpa 's sofas , Cini Boeri 's tables and the Breuer furniture went to Knoll .
" I was very bitter " , he said .
I thought my career as an entrepreneur was over .
I remembered my talent as a cultural organiser and set up the ‘ Centro Duchamp ' and published books and a magazine . "
The same year he also set up a new company , Simon International , partly because the design solutions of the time had become too restrictive for him .
He called the new line " Ultrarazionale " .
The line includes Carlo Scarpa 's three - metre- long table " Doge " made from a solid steel sheet and crystal and the mighty white marble table " Delfi " .
Long before the amusing elk from the north made an appearance , he sold the " Metamobili " range designed by Enzo Mari , which was inexpensive and featured furniture for home assembly .
" Back then , no - one realised that this idea had so much potential ! "
Man Ray and the eye
A shared passion for play led him to form a relationship with artist Man Ray .
In 1970 the pair co-launched a line of surreal " Ultrafurniture " , utilitarian objects and works of art at the same time .
Man Ray designed a big , swinging eye entitled " Le Temoin " [ The Witness ] and Meret Oppenheim a round bronze table with bird feet .
" It was " , Gavina commented , " a fairytale for designers bored with their own perfection . "
Furnishing has to develop
Dino Gavina lived in the high rooms of a former monastery block in the old town of Bologna .
From the windows , one can see the rosette of San Domenico .
His bicycle stood against the wall in the corridor .
For him , there were no rules for " beautiful homes " .
" Furnishing has to develop randomly . "
In the large living room stood a white cube which he slept in .
Over his bed hung a picture of Lucio Fontana , a steep staircase without landings led to the bathroom door high in the wall - a rather way - out ambience for an 85 - year - old man .
The place was full of self - manufactured pictures , books , objects d'art and furniture .
In his final years , three Italian fashion houses courted him , all wanting to launch out their own furniture collections .
But nothing came of it .
There has probably never been another entrepreneur in the world , who clung as stubbornly to an aesthetic , humanist utopia and hated pure consumerism , as Dino Gavina .
Last of all he founded an " earthly paradise society " , which manufactured furniture for city living .
Stubborn as ever , he fought against formal neglect .
So began his public lectures - to the horror of the organisers mostly including a destructive critique on furniture .
And students , who wear jeans had , in his eyes , forfeited the rights to take part in the aesthetics debate .
He could really get on your nerves .
On his visiting cards were the words " Dino Gavina . Sovversivo " - just subversive , no address , no telephone number .

WIRED25 2020 : Cybersecurity Experts on Cybercrime in the Time of Covid
Marc Rogers , Nate Warfield , and Ohad Zaidenberg spoke with Andy Greenberg at WIRED25 about the cyber threats facing hospitals and critical infrastructure during the pandemic , and the volunteer cybersecurity experts stopping them .
Run on the U.S. Dollar .... Soon
Porter Stansberry writes :
It 's one of those numbers that 's so unbelievable you have to actually think about it for a while ...
Within the next 12 months , the U.S. Treasury will have to refinance $ 2 trillion in short - term debt .
And that 's not counting any additional deficit spending , which is estimated to be around $ 1.5 trillion .
Put the two numbers together .
Then ask yourself , how in the world can the Treasury borrow $ 3.5 trillion in only one year ?
That 's an amount equal to nearly 30 % of our entire GDP .
And we 're the world 's biggest economy .
Where will the money come from ?
How did we end up with so much short - term debt ?
Like most entities that have far too much debt – whether subprime borrowers , GM , Fannie , or GE – the U.S. Treasury has tried to minimize its interest burden by borrowing for short durations and then " rolling over " the loans when they come due .
As they say on Wall Street , " a rolling debt collects no moss .
" What they mean is , as long as you can extend the debt , you have no problem .
Unfortunately , that leads folks to take on ever greater amounts of debt ... at ever shorter durations ... at ever lower interest rates .
Sooner or later , the creditors wake up and ask themselves :
What are the chances I will ever actually be repaid ?
And that 's when the trouble starts .
Interest rates go up dramatically .
Funding costs soar .
The party is over .
Bankruptcy is next .
When governments go bankrupt , it 's called a " default . "
Currency speculators figured out how to accurately predict when a country would default .
Two well - known economists – Alan Greenspan and Pablo Guidotti – published the secret formula in a 1999 academic paper .
The formula is called the Greenspan - Guidotti rule .
The rule states :
To avoid a default , countries should maintain hard currency reserves equal to at least 100 % of their short - term foreign debt maturities .
The world 's largest money - management firm , PIMCO , explains the rule this way : " The minimum benchmark of reserves equal to at least 100 % of short - term external debt is known as the Greenspan - Guidotti rule .
Greenspan - Guidotti is perhaps the single concept of reserve adequacy that has the most adherents and empirical support .
" The principle behind the rule is simple .
If you can't pay off all of your foreign debts in the next 12 months , you 're a terrible credit risk .
Speculators are going to target your bonds and your currency , making it impossible to refinance your debts .
A default is assured .
So how does America rank on the Greenspan - Guidotti scale ?
It 's a guaranteed default .
The U.S. holds gold , oil , and foreign currency in reserve .
It has 8,133.5 metric tonnes of gold ( it is the world 's largest holder ) .
At current dollar values , it 's worth around $ 300 billion .
The U.S. strategic petroleum reserve shows a current total position of 725 million barrels .
At current dollar prices , that 's roughly $ 58 billion worth of oil .
And according to the IMF , the U.S. has $ 136 billion in foreign currency reserves .
So altogether ... that 's around $ 500 billion of reserves .
Our short - term foreign debts are far bigger .
According to the U.S. Treasury , $ 2 trillion worth of debt will mature in the next 12 months .
So looking only at short - term debt , we know the Treasury will have to finance at least $ 2 trillion worth of maturing debt in the next 12 months .
That might not cause a crisis if we were still funding our national debt internally .
But since 1985 , we 've been a net debtor to the world .
Today , foreigners own 44 % of all our debts , which means we owe foreign creditors at least $ 880 billion in the next 12 months – an amount far larger than our reserves .
Keep in mind , this only covers our existing debts .
The Office of Management and Budget is predicting a $ 1.5 trillion budget deficit over the next year .
That puts our total funding requirements on the order of $ 3.5 trillion over the next 12 months .
So ... where will the money come from ?
Total domestic savings in the U.S. are only around $ 600 billion annually .
Even if we all put every penny of our savings into U.S.
Treasury debt , we 're still going to come up nearly $ 3 trillion short .
That 's an annual funding requirement equal to roughly 40 % of GDP .
Where is the money going to come from ?
From our foreign creditors ?
Not according to Greenspan - Guidotti .
And not according to the Indian or Russian central banks , which have stopped buying Treasury bills and begun to buy enormous amounts of gold .
The Indians bought 200 metric tonnes this month .
Sources in Russia say the central bank there will double its gold reserves .
So where will the money come from ?
The printing press .
The Federal Reserve has already monetized nearly $ 2 trillion worth of Treasury debt and mortgage debt .
This weakens the value of the dollar and devalues our existing Treasury bonds .
Sooner or later , our creditors will face a stark choice :
Hold our bonds and continue to see the value diminish slowly , or try to escape to gold and see the value of their U.S. bonds plummet .
One thing they 're not going to do is buy more of our debt .
Which central banks will abandon the dollar next ?
Brazil , Korea , and Chile .
These are the three largest central banks that own the least amount of gold .
None owns even 1 % of its total reserves in gold .
All of this is going to lead to a severe devaluation of the U.S. dollar ...
Which I expect to happen within 18 months .
I examined these issues in much greater detail in the most recent issue of my newsletter , Porter Stansberry 's Investment Advisory , which was published last week .
Coincidentally , America 's paper of record – the New York Times – repeated our warnings ( nearly word for word ) last weekend .
Word is getting out .
If you have n't taken steps to protect yourself from the coming devaluation – like owning gold and silver bullion , foreign real estate , and farmland – make sure you do it soon .
The dollar rout is coming .
Good investing , Porter Stansberry Editor 's note : Porter says his latest issue is the most important he 's ever written .
If you do n't act right now to protect yourself from the dollar , he thinks the odds are very high you 'll suffer a significant hit to your net worth soon .

Two things :
What is to keep the govt from confiscating gold ; and What is to keep the govt from hitting gold transfers with a 90 % profit tax ?
So , you get screwed anyway .
Larrabee is Dead , Long Live Larrabee
Intel just announced that the first incarnation of Larrabee wo n't be a consumer graphics card .
In other words , next year you 're not going to be able to purchase a Larrabee GPU and run games on it .
You 're also not going to be able to buy a Larrabee card and run your HPC workloads on it either .
Instead , the first version of Larrabee will exclusively be for developers interested in playing around with the chip .
And honestly , though disappointing , it does n't really matter .
The Larrabee Update at Fall IDF 2009
Intel has n't said much about why it was canceled other than it was behind schedule .
Intel recently announced that an overclocked Larrabee was able to deliver peak performance of 1 teraflop .
Something AMD was able to do in 2008 with the Radeon HD 4870 .
( Update : so it 's not exactly comparable , the point being that Larrabee is outgunned given today 's GPU offerings ) .
With the Radeon HD 5870 already at 2.7 TFLOPS peak , chances are that Larrabee was n't going to be remotely competitive , even if it came out today .
We all knew this , no one was expecting Intel to compete at the high end .
Its agents have been quietly talking about the uselessness of >
$ 200 GPUs for much of the past two years , indicating exactly where Intel views the market for Larrabee 's first incarnation .
Thanks to AMD 's aggressive rollout of the Radeon HD 5000 series , even at lower price points Larrabee would n't have been competitive - delayed or not .
I 've got a general rule of thumb for Intel products .
Around 4 - 6 months before an Intel CPU officially ships , Intel 's partners will have it in hand and running at near - final speeds .
Larrabee has n't been let out of Intel hands , chances are that it 's more than 6 months away at this point .
By then Intel would n't have been able to release Larrabee at any price point other than free .
It 'd be slower at games than sub $ 100 GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA , and there 's no way that the first drivers would n't have some incompatibly issues .
To make matters worse , Intel 's 45 nm process would stop looking so advanced by mid 2010 .
Thus the only option is to forgo making a profit on the first chips altogether rather than pull an NV30 or R600 .
So where do we go from here ?
AMD and NVIDIA will continue to compete in the GPU space as they always have .
If anything this announcement supports NVIDIA 's claim that making these things is , ahem , difficult ; even if you 're the world 's leading x86 CPU maker .
Do I believe the 48 - core research announcement had anything to do with Larrabee 's cancelation ?
Not really .
The project came out of a different team within Intel .
Intel Labs have worked on bits and pieces of technologies that will ultimately be used inside Larrabee , but the GPU team is quite different .
Either way , the canceled Larrabee was a 32 - core part .
A publicly available Larrabee graphics card at 32nm is n't guaranteed , either .
Intel says they 'll talk about the first Larrabee GPU sometime in 2010 , which means we 're looking at 2011 at the earliest .
Given the timeframe I 'd say that a 32nm Larrabee is likely but again , there are no guarantees .
It 's not a huge financial loss to Intel .
Intel still made tons of money all the while Larrabee 's development was underway .
Its 45 nm fabs are old news and paid off .
Intel was n't going to make a lot of money off of Larrabee had it sold them on the market , definitely not enough to recoup the R&D investment , and as I just mentioned using Larrabee sales to pay off the fabs is n't necessary either .
Financially it 's not a problem , yet .
If Larrabee never makes it to market , or fails to eventually be competitive , then it's a bigger problem .
If heterogenous multicore is the future of desktop and mobile CPUs , Larrabee needs to succeed otherwise Intel 's future will be in jeopardy .
It 's far too early to tell if that 's worth worrying about .
One reader asked how this will impact Haswell .
I do n't believe it will , from what I can tell Haswell does n't use Larrabee .
Intel has a different vision of the road to the CPU / GPU union .
AMD's Fusion strategy combines CPU and GPU compute starting in 2011 .
Intel will have a single die with a CPU and GPU on it , but the GPU is n't expected to be used for much compute at that point .
Intel 's roadmap has the CPU and AVX units being used for the majority of vectorized floating point throughout 2011 and beyond .
Intel 's vision for the future of x86 CPUs announced in 2005 , surprisingly accurate
It 's not until you get in the 2013 - 2015 range that Larrabee even comes into play .
The Larrabee that makes it into those designs will look nothing like the retail chip that just got canceled .
Intel 's announcement was n't too surprising or devastating , it just makes things a bit less interesting .
It started about 10 years ago : prior to this I had no male friends .
There were certainly men in my life whom I liked and respected , but no one I would meet up with for a drink and a heart - to - heart .
Why ?
Not , dear readers , because I am a man-hater .
As I have written before , I only hate those who rape and abuse women and children , and those who do nothing to stop other men doing so .
I will give you a little history here .
When I came out as a lesbian , in 1978 , there was a vibrant women 's liberation movement in the UK .
I moved to Leeds two years later to track these women down and join forces with them .
In those days , if you were a truly radical feminist you were a lesbian .
If you were a lesbian , chances are you were involved in feminism in some way .
I made no friends with men because my whole life became about trying to stop the violent and misogynistic ones hurting women .
I knew there were good men , but I had no time for them and often found that they felt threatened by my lesbianism and hardline politics .
As time moved on , I noticed a change in some of the men I came into regular contact with , such as the partners and relatives of heterosexual friends and those I met through work .
They were becoming less defensive about and more responsive to feminism .
My lesbianism , which many men took as a personal slight back in the bad old days , stopped being an issue .
I met gay men who had some politics and not just around issues that directly affected them .
I met Shaun , the partner of a good friend of mine , and he and I became mates , so much so that I even agreed to be best woman at his wedding ( the first one I had ever agreed to attend ) .
Then I started to go on the odd night out with a young man I met while researching a story .
Then I acquired more men , gay and straight , until I began to invite them to parties and then to dinner and then , recently , even on holiday !
I , too , have definitely softened around the edges in the past few years ( yes , really ) and my work as a journalist researching sexual violence and other crimes has brought me into contact with some of the best of men .
I met Gian , a radical psychiatrist and expert on the effects of sexual violence , when doing a story for this newspaper on stalking - related murders .
Only last week he was in my kitchen , devouring most of a leg of lamb I had cooked for us .
Paul is a fellow journalist – his partner describes him as my evil male twin .
I like being close to a few good men , but I will continue to give the bad ones a really hard time .
It is my job .
But in the meantime , I have to go Christmas shopping with a group of female friends .
There are some things you can't even ask a nice man to do with you .
He said that there was no training he could do to prepare for the event and he had no special regime for his unbreakable hair .
" I just use shampoo , like the kind you can get in any pound shop up and down the country , " he laughed .
Cel and Katie take a first look at how the UK's new Official Chart is shaping up !
In a small Minnesota town , the annual beauty pageant is being covered by a TV crew .
Former winner Gladys Leeman wants to make sure her daughter follows in her footsteps .
Explosions , falling lights , and trailer fires prove that .
As the Leemans are the richest family in town the police are pretty relaxed about it all .
Despite everything , main rival ( but nice ) Amber Atkins wo n't be stopped .
There could well be more death and disappointment to come .

From March next year , I ’ll focus my Canonical energy on product design , partnerships and customers .
Those are the areas that I enjoy most and also the areas where I can best shape the impact we have on open source and the technology market .
I ’m able to do this because Jane Silber , who has been COO at Canonical virtually from the beginning , will take on the job of CEO .
Since Jane joined the company , she and I have shared the load of coordinating between the leaders of all the key teams that make up Canonical .
We ’ve been through various permutations as new initiatives needed different kinds of attention ; Jane currently leads the Ubuntu One effort , for example .
I ’ve become very passionate about design and quality , and want to spend more time figuring out how we harness the collaborative process to build better , more insightful products .
I ca n’t think of a more interesting challenge , and luckily I could n’t think of a better person to take over my formal management and leadership responsibilities at Canonical than Jane .
We ’ve worked together long enough , and closely enough , that I can be confident of continuity in the pieces I most care about and also excited about the ways in which I think Jane will raise the bar for the senior team .
As a former VP at General Dynamics , Jane has more experience of large customers and large organisational leadership , which I see as essential for Canonical over the next five years .
We are being welcomed as a partner and supplier to ever - larger businesses , and I want to make sure we are a robust answer to their needs .
Many folks in the community will know Jane from Ubuntu Developer Summits , and of course she ’s well established as a leader at Canonical .
In order to focus on the new role , we ’ll be hiring for a COO and a new lead for Ubuntu One ( both positions will be advertised publicly as well as within Canonical ) .
There ’s no rush , so we plan to coordinate things carefully and I expect I ’ll be focused on my new role by March .

According to Xinhua , the state news agency , the new rules are an acknowledgement that times have moved on .
Over the past decades , China 's marriage system has gone through a series of changes which have so far ignored the individual 's marriage rights and privacy , it said .
Under the new rules , people wanting to wed will only have to provide their identity cards and residence permits , and promise that they are not already married .
If you 've lost sleep over questions like , " How many balloons would it take to airlift a man ? " or " Can a playing card be hurled fast enough to inflict more harm than just a paper cut ?

It 's hosted by Jamie Hyneman , a model maker and special - effects expert for the movie and TV industries , and Adam Savage , whose handy expertise includes carpentry , welding , and animation .
The two devise experiments to prove or disprove urban legends and other esoteric theories .
They combine physics , chemistry , biology , and geometry to lay out their experiments , and the steps preceding the test are as fascinating as the test itself .
For example , to answer the age - old Pop Rocks question , Jamie and Adam hang a pig 's stomach ( similar to a human 's ) in a human skeleton to test its durability against six candy packets and a six - pack of soda consumed simultaneously .

A Taiwanese player under the alias ‘ Little Gray ’ on the Wrathbringer server has completed all 986 achievements in World of Warcaft listed in the World of Warcraft Armory .
Controversy has spread through the WOW community as several players noted he has not legitimately completed the ‘ BB King ’ achievement and only attended it through a glitch during PvP .
Every once in a while you get to see a mainstream outlet cover a story right alongside a blog , so you can put them up against each other and see why one was so much better than the other .
This week TechCrunch and the New York Times ( photo ) provided just such a lesson .
The issue was a company called Zynga , which makes online games , like FarmVille , that have become incredibly popular on Facebook among people who are missing parts of their brains .
On Oct. 31 TechCrunch broke a big story called “ Scamville : The Social Gaming Ecosystem of Hell ” about how Zynga was making money by selling scam ads — the kind that trick kids and other frigtards into signing up for useless subscriptions to stuff they do n’t want .
Arrington packaged his story with a video of himself taking on Anu Shukla , CEO of one of the scam - ad distributors , at a conference .
He also ran an “ insider ’s confession ” piece by a former scammer explaining how these guys operate .
He followed with a story about how Zynga CEO Mark Pincus had acknowledged the problem and said Zynga would stop running those ads , and another story about how Anu Shukla had been pushed out of her company , and another story about Shukla ’s replacement admitting that the company had , indeed , been running scammy ads .
On Friday Arrington capped it off with a coup : he dug up a video clip from earlier this year in which Pincus , the CEO of Zynga , told a laughing audience of scumbag developers about all the scumbaggy things he had done to generate revenue with his games .
After all this , we woke up Saturday to find a story in the New York Times , also about Zynga ( and other Facebook game companies ) with the headline , “ Virtual Goods Start Bringing Real Paydays . ”
The Times put two reporters on the knob - polisher , and somehow they managed to interview Pincus , and to quote him — and yet they included not a single word about the scammy ads .
Not. A. Fucking .
Word .
The piece could not have been nicer if it had been written by Zynga ’s PR people themselves .
Gist : Virtual goods , stupid idea , people play , some spend money , VCs love it , is n’t this great .
Ahem .
So : they walked into this shit - storm and somehow , by some miracle , managed not to notice the fecal matter flying all around them .
It ’s like covering a football game that took place in the middle of the blizzard and neglecting to mention the weather .
Now , maybe they did all the reporting before Arrington ’s stuff broke .
In which case they should have gone back and updated their info .
Or maybe , just maybe , Zynga ’s PR people teed up a Times story as a kind of rebuttal to what Arrington was reporting .
Either way , that ’s what ended up happening : Zynga used the Times to deflect the bad shit flying at them from Arrington .
They need good press because they ’re hoping to cash out by going public next year .
That story in the Times will be worth millions .
Many millions .
Meanwhile , Arrington , still digging , blasted again on Saturday night , reporting that sleazy ads had popped up again on Zynga , despite promises that they would be taken down .
Um , New York Times ?
If you guys are still wondering why people are dropping their subscriptions and getting their news from blogs instead of you — this is why .
And to all those people who go around wringing their hands and saying what are we going to do when the “ real newspapers ” all die and we have to get our news from Gawker and HuffPo and TechCrunch ?
Friends , I think we ’re going to be just fine .
Part of it is the form of the media itself .
If you ’re a reporter at the Times , you get one story , and a fixed number of inches , and you ’re smothered by layers of editors .
At Tech Crunch it ’s one guy who can get his teeth into something and there ’s no limit on how many articles he can do .
What really cracks me up is how often I still hear people say that bloggers are mere “ aggregators ” and the “ real journalism ” gets done at places like the Times .
Because time after time , blogs are simply beating the shit out of the newspapers .
They ’re the ones who still dare to go for the throat , while their counterparts at big newspapers just keep reaching for the shrimp cocktail .
As for the newspapers : Faced with their own demise , fearful of losing even more advertising , newspapers have made the huge mistake of becoming ever more timid , more cautious , more in bed with the companies they cover .
It ’s the exact opposite of what they should be doing .
The truth is , if newspapers want to survive they should go back to doing what they started out doing — muckraking , stirring the shit , calling bullshit .
The other truth is , when these papers are dead , they will not be missed .
Did you know that Ford once employed a Poet Laureate ?
Oh yes ! , we say resoundingly .
To name new cars more poetically , and hopefully excitingly , and to kickstart their stuck development team , the carmaker in 1955 contracted with Marianne Moore , the American writer , who then served for one brief season as the Ford Motor Company ’s unofficial poet laureate .
Some of her new car name suggestions were :
The Ford Silver Sword
Intelligent Bullet
The Ford Fabergé
Mongoose Civique
Anticipator
Pastelogram
Astranaut
Utopian Turtletop
Okay , then .
Well , clearly , those were n’t very good .
And Ford agreed , politely rejecting all of Moore ’s suggestions .
But now , after the government has bought two - thirds of the domestic auto industry in an effort to raise it out of its ongoing malaise , why not have Icarus Landing name new lines of cars ?
And not just for GM and Chrysler , for everybody !
Yes , Icarus Landing – Poet Laureate to the World ’s Finest Automobiles !
Great idea !
We here at Icarus Landing officially love this idea !
So here , already , are some of our suggestions for all the new models coming out soon :

The theft was discovered by one of the former leader 's guards on Friday Thieves have stolen the remains of Tassos Papadopoulos , the former president of the Republic of Cyprus , police say .
Mr Papadopoulos ' body was removed after his grave in Nicosia was broken into overnight , officials said .
Mr Papadopoulos died of lung cancer in Nicosia in 2008 , aged 74 .
The theft from the Deftera village cemetery in Nicosia was discovered a day before the first anniversary of his death .
The desecration was discovered by one of Mr Papadopoulos 's former guards who lights a candle in the cemetery every morning , the official Cyprus News Agency reports .
The robbers are thought to have worked during torrential rain overnight , lifting a marble slab weighing 250kg before unearthing the coffin and removing the corpse .
Eloquence and anger
The theft has been widely condemned .
Republic of Cyprus President Demetris Christofias described it as " sacrilege " .
" It is an immoral and condemnable act which is a blight to our culture and respect for our dead , " said Mr Christofias on the sidelines of the European Council summit in Brussels .
TASSOS PAPADOPOULOS
Born in 1934 Trained as a barrister in London during the 1950s Achieved prominence in the political wing of the right - wing paramilitary group EOKA Became youngest government minister , aged 24 , in 1959 after independence from British rule Occupied several ministerial positions , before narrowly winning the presidential election in 2003
Lost a bid for a second term as president in February 2008 , before dying in December 2008 Marios Garoyan , leader of the former president 's centre - right Diko party , condemned the act as a " heinous and terrible crime " , AFP reported .
Andros Kyprianou , the head of Cyprus ' ruling Akel party , described it as " macabre and utterly condemnable " .
" I am honestly still trying to comprehend what kind of warped minds could even think of doing such a thing , let alone actually carry it out , " he said .
The motive for the theft remains unclear , investigators say .
But it is bound to stir up passions over a UN - led peace effort aimed at reuniting the Turkish and Greek parts of the island , says the BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens .
Mr Papadopoulos was vehemently opposed to the peace plan , and his eloquence and anger convinced a resounding majority of Greek Cypriots to vote against it in a referendum , while Turkish Cypriots voted overwhelmingly in favour .
A veteran of Greek Cypriot politics , he became president in 2003 but lost a bid for a second term in 2008 .
He was defeated by Demetris Christofias , a former coalition partner .
One of the former president 's achievements was to oversee the Republic of Cyprus 's entry into the European Union in 2004 .

MOUNTAIN VIEW , California – Google today unveiled more details of Chrome OS , a lightweight , browser - based operating system for netbooks .
With a strong focus on speed , the Chrome OS promises nearly instant boot times of about 7 seconds for users to login to their computers .
" We want Google Chrome OS to be blazingly fast ... to boot up like a TV , " said Sundar Pichai , vice president of product management for Google .
The first Chrome OS netbooks will be available in late 2010 , Pichai said .
It will not be available as a download to run and install .
Instead , Chrome OS is only shipping on specific hardware from manufacturers Google has partnered with .
That means if you want Chrome OS , you 'll have to purchase a Chrome OS device .
Google is currently working with unnamed computer manufacturers to define specifications for these computers , which Pichai said will include larger netbook - style computers with full - size keyboards , large trackpads and large displays .
Chrome OS netbooks will not have traditional hard disk drives – they will rely on non-volatile flash memory and internet - based storage for saving all of your data .
All the applications will be web - based , meaning users wo n't have to install apps , manage updates or even backup their data .
All data will be stored in the cloud , and users wo n't even have to bother with anti-virus software : Google claims it will monitor code to prevent malicious activity in Chrome OS web apps .
" Chrome OS is a totally rethought computer that will let you focus on the internet , so you can stop worrying about your computer , " according to a Google promotional video shown at the event , held at the Google campus in Mountain View , California .
As part of its announcement today , Pichai said that Google would be releasing all of the operating system 's code and design documents to the public .
Introduced in July , Chrome OS is a Linux - based , open - source operating system centered on Google 's Chrome browser .
Applications will run exclusively inside the browser , Google said Thursday .
" As of today , the code will be fully open , which means Google developers will be working on the same tree as open developers , " said Pichai .
The OS 's focus on design is consistent with the company 's stance that the future is in the web .
In July , Vic Gundotra , Google ’s engineering vice president and developer evangelist , spoke on a panel about app stores , in which he said native apps ( such as those available for the iPhone ) would be obsolete in the future , and that the web will " become the platform that matters . "
" Every capability you want today , in the future it will be written as a web application , " Pichai said Thursday .
Netbooks — lightweight , low - powered subnotebooks — were the surprise hit of 2008 and 2009 .
However , with the growth of netbook sales slowing – and the prices of some full - powered notebooks dropping below $ 400 – the continued viability of the netbook sector is an open question .
Though netbook shipments are falling below manufacturers ' expectations , the inexpensive , low - powered devices appear to still be selling well .
Pichai cited research figures from ABI research indicating that 35 million netbooks shipped in 2009 , more than twice the number sold in 2008 .
Manufacturers have yet to announce pricing on netbooks shipping with Chrome OS , but Google expects the cost to be about the same as current netbooks .
On average , netbooks cost between $ 300 and $ 500 .
Videos demonstrating Chrome OS 's user interface , security , fast boot and other features are below the jump .

Suppose you are a C++ programmer on a project and you have the best intentions to write really good code .
The one fellow that you better make friends with is your compiler .
He will support you in your efforts whenever he can .
Unless you do n’t let him .
One sure way to reject his help is to switch off all compiler warnings .
I know it should be well - known by now that compiling at high warning levels is something to do always and anytime but it seems that many people just do n’t do it .
Taking g++ as example , high warning levels do not mean just having “ - Wall ” switched on .
Even if its name suggests otherwise , “ - Wall ” is just the minimum there .
If you just spend like 5 minutes or so to look at the man page of g++ you find many many more helpful and reasonable - W… switches .
For example ( g++-4.3.2 ) :
- Wctor - dtor - privacy : Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or destructors in that class are private , and it has neither friends nor public static member functions .
Cool stuff !
Let ’s what else is there :
- Woverloaded - virtual : Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a base class .
Example :
class Base
{
public :
virtual void myFunction ( ) ;
} ;
class Subclass : public Base
{
public :
void myFunction ( ) const ;
} ;
I would certainly like to be warned about that , but may be that ’s just me .
- Weffc ++ : Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers ’ Effective C++ book
This is certainly one of the most “ effective ” weapons in your fight for bug - free software .
It causes the compiler to spit out warnings about code issues that can lead to subtle and hard - to - find bugs but also about things that are considered good programming practice .
So suppose you read the g++ man page , you enabled all warning switches additional to “ - Wall ” that seem reasonable to you and you plan to compile your project cleanly without warnings .
Unfortunately , chances are quite high that your effort will be instantly thwarted by third - party libraries that your code includes .
Because even if your code is clean and shiny , header files of third - pary library may be not .
Especially with “ - Weffc + + ” this could result in a massive amount of warning messages in code that you have no control of .
Even with the otherwise powerful , easy - to - use and supposedly mature Qt library you run into that problem .
Compiling code that includes
Qt headers like < QComboBox > with “ - Weffc + + ” switched on is just unbearable .
Leaving aside the fact that my confidence in Qt has declined considerably since I noticed this , the question remains what to do ignore the shortcomings of other peoples code .
With GCC you can for example add pragmas around offending includes as desribed here .
Or you can create wrapper headers for third - party includes that contain
# pragma GCC system_header
AFAIK Microsoft ’s compilers have similar pragmas :
# pragma warning ( push , 1 )
#include
#include
# pragma warning ( pop )
Warning switches are a powerful tool to increase your code quality .
You just have to use them !
Snapping a 23 - year streak on the gridiron , PepsiCo 's beverages will sit out Super Bowl XLIV , as the soft - drink and snack giant puts its advertising muscle behind a new cause - related marketing program .
The move is an about - face for Pepsi , which was the biggest advertiser on last year 's broadcast of the big game and has long made the National Football League championship the centerpiece of its marketing strategy .
Pepsi has used the event , TV 's priciest showcase for ads , to launch splashy spots starring celebrities such as Britney Spears , Cindy Crawford and Ozzy Osbourne .
" In 2010 , each of our beverage brands has a strategy and marketing platform that will be less about a singular event , " says Frank Cooper , senior vice president of PepsiCo Americas Beverages .
However , Doritos , a PepsiCo snack brand , will advertise during the game broadcast .
The decision leaves the field open for archrival Coca - Cola , which is putting the finishing touches on a Super Bowl ad that will feature the Simpsons , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Coke jumped back into Super Bowl advertising in 2007 , after an eight - year hiatus , and has given Pepsi some tough competition in generating Super Bowl buzz .
To implement its new strategy , Pepsi , based in Purchase , N.Y. , will plunge into the crowded field of cause - related marketing in coming weeks with a campaign to kick off " Pepsi Refresh Project . "
Under the program , Pepsi will award grant money for community projects proposed and selected by consumers , such as helping high - school students publish books to develop their writing skills .
Pepsi says it has earmarked $ 20 million of its ad dollars for the grants next year .
Between 1939 and 1945 , one of the worst wars in history was fought out between two opposing forces that were so large and wide - spread , it became known as the Second World War .
In a bid to stop Adolf Hitler and his allies , who were known as the ‘ Axis ’ powers , the ‘ Allies ’ worked on many weapons projects to try to develop new ways to help them win the war .
While many were successful and eventually helped the allied cause , other ideas that went into development ended up being shelved , often because they were just a little too weird to work !

The Pigeon - Guided Missile
American behaviorist B.F. Skinner hit on a novel idea for the war effort when he came up with the idea for ‘ Project Orcon ’ ( which stood for organic control ) , which was his attempt to produce the world ’s first pigeon - guided missile .
The control system had a lens attached to the missile which projected an image of the target to a screen .
Three trained pigeons would then peck at the target on the screen and where they pecked would determine where the missile hit .
As long as they pecked the center of the screen the missile would remain on target but if they pecked off center , the missile would change course , as long as two of the three had it right though , the target would be hit
The National Defense Research Committee put $ 25,000 for research into the project but despite this , for some unfathomable reason , the US military did n’t take the idea too seriously .
On the 8th October , 1944 the project was canceled , the official reason given was ; “ further prosecution of this project would seriously delay others which in the minds of the Division have more immediate promise of combat application . ”

The Flying Jeep
The Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment in Manchester , UK began work in 1940 on attaching rotor blades to a jeep .
Nicknamed the ‘ Rotabuggy ’ , initial tests involved dropping the jeep from heights of a few meters while it was filled with concrete to demonstrate it could take the impact without damage .
The jeep was then fitted with additional equipment including the rotor blades , a tail fairing with twin rudderless fins , a rotor control next to the steering wheel and glider navigational instruments .
In 1943 , the first test flight was conducted when the Rotabuggy was toed behind a Bentley and managed to glide at speeds of up to 65 mph .
The initial flights had limited success as handling proved difficult but after some modifications , the flying qualities of the vehicle were officially described as “ highly satisfactory ” .
However the project became deemed unnecessary with the development of Horsa II and Hamilcar which were gliders equipped to carry vehicles .

The Poisoned Dart Bomb
Between 1941 and 1944 , British scientists were working on a top secret project to developed a projectile bomb that released darts tipped with poison .
A recently de-classified document entitled ‘ Research Into Use of Anthrax and Other Poisons for Biological Warfare ’ revealed that sewing machine needles would be used in the weapon and tipped with a lethal poison , which would probably be either anthrax or ricin .
According to a 1945 memo about the project , light darts could be used as the poison ensured slight penetration would be lethal and there was no need to hit vital organs .
It also had the added advantage , according to the memo , of making it so that medical treatment would be unlikely to prevent the victim ’s death .
The bombs could carry 30,600 needles and if they hit , you were likely to be dead within half an hour .
However the chances of hitting someone varied and while they would have had great effect against troops out in the open , they were virtually useless when there was any type of cover .
This made them unlikely to cause mass damage frequently and therefore uneconomical and as a result , they never made it passed the planning stage .

Previous | Next Vegan Housemate Posted at : 2009 - 12-16 13:51:38 Original ad :
Hey there !
My roommate and I are looking for another housemate .
We live in a large apartment in Upper Darby .
There are two bedrooms and a spacious living area .
The rent is $ 250 a month , which includes cable , internet , electric , and water .
My roommate and I are both vegans and will only live with another vegan .
IF YOU AREN'T A VEGAN , YOU NEED NOT APPLY .
We are looking for someone who will help with the cooking , in addition to the rent .
If you are a vegan and want to live with two vegans who respect your personal space , please e-mail us .
Include some information about yourself , including your source of income .
From Me to ***********@***********.org :
Hey ,
I saw your ad , and I can't tell you how happy I was to see that there are fellow vegans looking for a roommate .
It is so hard to find someone to live with who respects my way of life .
Are you guys still looking for someone to live with ?
Mike
From Joanna ******** to Me :
Yes , we still are seeking a third housemate .
Can you tell us about yourself ?
From Me to Joanna ********:
Well , I am a 24 year old male , and I am currently make a living by being employed .
It pays well .
Now , as I said earlier , I am a hardcore vegan .
I totally respect your lifestyle , but I will occasionally eat a veal burger , maybe two or three times a week .
I hope that is n't a big deal .
If it is , I can eat it outside , but I will still need to cook it in the kitchen .
But besides that , I am easy to get along with .
I love watching TV .
I hope you guys like CSPAN and late night HBO as much as I do .
I also love music , and think I will be a great addition to your apartment .
Mike
From Joanna ******** to Me :
You 're not a vegan if you eat veal .
Seriously , veal ?
That is perhaps the single worst thing a vegan can eat .
Calves that are raised to become veal are ripped from their mothers at birth so they get anemia .
Then they are starved of milk , food , and exercise .
They often are put in crates so they cannot move at all ; they just stand and suffer until their ultimate death .
Veal goes against everything veganism stands for .
How you even consider calling yourself a vegan astounds me .
From Me to Joanna ********:
Well thanks for the veal history lesson .
My ex used to bitch to me about veal all the time , so I know all about it .
Frankly , I think that is why I enjoy veal .
Knowing that the calf suffered so much to make himself that much more tender and delicious for me makes it worth every bite .
If I did n't eat veal , it would probably expire and be thrown away .
Then , the calf would have died in vein .
You would n't want that , would you .
Seriously , veal is n't that bad .
They give the calf a nice safe home to live in .
Would you rather they just let the calf just be let loose out in the wild ?
Then , it would probably be killed by a lion or something .
By supporting veal , you are supporting the safe life of cows everywhere .
Seeing as how you got all uppity about the veal , I guess I should tell you that I own two shotguns and an assault rifle for hunting and will need to store them in the apartment .
I did n't think it would be a big deal , but I may as well tell you everything .
Do n't worry though , both the shotguns are registered and the assault rifle has the serial numbers filed off of it so it does n't have to be registered .
From Joanna ******** to Me :
Do n't worry , you do n't need to tell me anything else because you are n't going to live with us .
I highly doubt there is anything about your life that even makes you close to being a vegan .
You 're argument sounds like something a twelve - year - old would say .
You 're clearly just claiming to be vegan to live in a cheap apartment .
If you really think you are vegan , think again .
Vegans do n't hunt , idiot .
From Me to Joanna ********:
C'mon , it is n't like I 'm eating the animals after I kill them .
I just kill them because I hate deer .
I can't tell you how many times I 've stepped in deer shit - they shit everywhere .
They are worse than old people .
One time my little brother ate some deer shit because he thought it was beans .
We had to take him to the hospital to get him tested for Lyme disease .
I 'm just killing deer to make Pennsylvania a better , safer place for children .
I 'm not eating them , so relax .
I still do n't eat chicken or burgers or any of that shit .
You are really picky about the vegans that you want to live with .
So when is the lease for your place up ?
I 'm looking for a place to live for about five or six months , and the sooner I can move in , the better .
From Joanna ******** to Me :
YOU'RE NOT A VEGAN !
From Joanna ******** to Me :
Not eating certain kinds of meat does n't make you a vegan .
Veganism is a lifestyle which prohibits using any kind of animal product , be it food , clothes , or anything else .
Hunting is absolutely unacceptable and your reasons for hunting are ridiculous .
You wo n't be living at my apartment so give it up .
From Me to Joanna ********:
Wow , I never thought I would find someone as pretentious as Bono , but you take the cake .
Next time I bite into a savory beef brisket , I 'll think of you .

A day without landline phones ?
Some may say that 's inevitable , but it looks like AT&T is now starting to try to speed things up a bit , with it recently responding to an FCC request for comments with a 32 - page filing that details its position on the matter .
That more or less boils down to two major requests : that the FCC eliminate the regulatory requirements that it support a landline network , and that it provide a firm deadline for phasing it out .
To back up that request , AT&T has provided the FCC with a whole host of statistics that paint a bleak picture for landlines , including the fact that less than 20 % of Americans rely exclusively on switched - access lines for voice service ( though plenty more still use them as their primary voice service ) , that at least 18 million homes now use a VoIP service , and that those two numbers are fast growing in opposite directions .
Needless to say , such a change would have a broad range of regulatory implications , and AT&T is n't providing answers for everything -- like exactly how it expects that last mile of users to transition away from landlines , or how to deal with issues of public safety or those with disabilities .
Fox stands firm in Time Warner Cable fee dispute
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A midnight deadline passed Friday , but the Fox network has still not resolved its differences with Time Warner Cable on a deal to keep its channels on the air in several major cities .
Time Warner Cable and News Corp. ( NWS , Fortune 500 ) , Fox 's parent company , have been locked in a public battle over how much the cable giant should pay for the right to deliver Fox networks into its subscribers ' homes .
If a deal is not reached , all of the Fox - owned broadcast networks and some of its cable channels could disappear for most of Time Warner Cable 's 13 million subscribers in cities such as New York , Los Angeles , Chicago and Boston .
Shortly after midnight ET , representatives from both companies said they were still negotiating .
News Corp. wants to charge Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) $ 1 per subscriber for airing its broadcast station , Fox .
The contracts for six Fox cable channels -- FX , Speed , Fuel TV , Fox Reality , Fox Soccer and Fox Sports en Español -- as well as certain regional sports networks are also slated to expire .
But Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network will not be affected .
Public officials weigh in
As the deadline approached , a flurry of government officials tried to intervene .
On Thursday , Rep. Steve Israel , D - N.Y. , wrote a letter calling for a 30 - day " cooling off period " to avoid programming blackouts .
Time Warner Cable responded that it would agree to an interim agreement , but a Fox Network representative said the company was not ready to agree to that temporary deal and would continue to negotiate .
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski also weighed in , saying the companies should " agree to a temporary extension of carriage . "
Fox refused an offer made by Time Warner Cable Wednesday to enter binding arbitration with the FCC .
That offer stemmed from a suggestion made in a letter written Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass. , who is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communication , Technology and the Internet , addressed to both companies .
A Time Warner Cable spokeswoman said " we 've offered reasonable compensation , agreed to carry Fox while we work out a deal , and agreed to binding arbitration .
We 've done everything we can to reach a fair agreement . "
She would not comment on the fees offered to Fox , saying that negotiations are ongoing " but [ Fox 's ] current demands are still unreasonable , " especially during a recession .
What 's at stake
The dispute reflects television 's changing business model , as programming choices continue to expand and advertising revenues plummet , noted David Wertheimer , chief executive of the Entertainment Technology Center at the University of Southern California .
Cable networks have always counted on revenue from both advertising and subscriber fees .
So even as ad sales have declined , cable channels have stayed afloat on those fees , which Wertheimer says have remained steady .
But broadcast networks that rely solely on ad revenue are casting about for new sources of revenue , which is likely what 's driving Fox 's bid for higher fees .
At the same time , providers like Time Warner Cable are in a costly battle to retain subscribers as they fend off threats from satellite TV and Web - based programming .
Time Warner Cable argues that Fox is charging too much to renew the contract and that any cost increase would only hurt consumers .
End - of - year standoffs between cable providers and TV networks are n't uncommon , since these deals typically expire on Dec. 31 .
At midnight , Fox is scheduled to be airing the Billboard New Year 's Eve with Carmen Electra and FX is slated to show paid programming .
If the new year does n't bring a new agreement , it would be a lose - lose situation for the companies .
Time Warner Cable 's customers would undoubtedly be angered to lose access to programming like NFL Football , " House " and " American Idol , " and some might cancel their subscriptions .
At the same time , the Fox networks would lose millions of viewers that its advertisers want to reach .
The companies will likely come to an agreement , however .
Last year Time Warner Cable and Viacom ( VIA ) , which owns MTV , Comedy Central and Nickelodeon , were deadlocked in a similar battle but reached an agreement early on Jan .

Furious football fans
But two Florida cable subscribers , who also happen to be avid football fans , were n't willing to take that chance .
University of Florida alums Thomas Moore and Richard Anderson were so concerned that a stalemate would cause them to miss the Sugar Bowl football game on Jan. 1 that they filed a petition for temporary injunction Wednesday against News Corp .
Their complaint , filed by Morgan & Morgan law firm , claims that the two men " can never be made whole " if they miss the New Year 's Day game .
According to the filing , Thomas Moore and Richard Anderson " have alleged and will demonstrate that [ News Corp.'s ] actions are immoral , unethical , oppressive , and unscrupulous . "
News reports said Circuit Judge Maura Smith in Orlando declined to rule on the case Wednesday , saying she would let a U.S. judge decide if federal court was the proper venue .
Calls to Smith 's office and to Morgan & Morgan were not returned , and it remains unclear whether Moore and Anderson will be able to witness what they describe as an " event of undeniable public interest . "
Cablevision drops Food , HGTV
In a separate dispute , Cablevision Systems , which delivers cable programming to homes in the New York metropolitan area , said Friday it was no longer carrying channels operated by Scripps Networks , including The Food Channel and HGTV .
" We are sorry that Scripps ' current financial difficulties are making it impossible for them to continue our relationship on terms that are reasonable for Cablevision and our customers , " Cablevision said in a statement .
" We wish Scripps well and have no expectation of carrying their programming again , given the dramatic changes in their approach to working with distributors to reach television viewers . "
" Viewers love our talent and our shows , which is why Food Network and HGTV rank among the top networks in cable , " said Kenneth W. Lowe , chairman of Scripps Networks Interactive , in a statement .
" But our valuable networks simply are not being compensated like top ten networks by Cablevision . "
Scripps says it has launched viewer Web campaigns aimed at getting the two networks back on Cablevision , which says it has 4.7 million customers in the New York area .
In a another cable retransmission negotiation , Baltimore - based Sinclair Broadcasting said Thursday it has agreed to an 8 - day extension of its agreement with cable operator Mediacom , to midnight ET on Jan .

St. Louis , Milwaukee and Nashville , Tenn .
Officials at the Arizona Game and Fish Department say a Yavapai County man was attacked by a rabid bobcat on Monday .
Rather than panic , he strangled it with his bare hands .
The man 's name is not being released because of privacy laws , but AGFD officials say the attack happened in the front yard of his Crown King Trail home , about 12 miles north of Lake Pleasant .
" This was particularly unusual because the gentleman killed the animal with his bare hands , and that was very advantageous because the animal was n't out potentially exposing other people to rabies , " Randy Babb , spokesman for the AGFD , tells CBS 5 ( KPHO ) .
Arizona is seeing record numbers of rabid animals in 2009 , with 244 that have tested positive for the disease .
That is an increase from the 176 cases reported last year , which was the previous record .
However , Arizonans prove to not be backing down to these rabid rascals .
Just last month , a Chino Valley woman was attacked by a fox while she was jogging .
The fox bit down on her arm and would n't let go , so the woman kept jogging for about a mile and a half , with the fox clamped into her flesh .
She finally reached her car with the fox still attached , where she managed to pry the thing off and put it in the trunk .
It was later determined that the maniac fox had rabies .
Officials at the AGFD , however , do n't recommend taking matters into your own , um , hands if you can help it .
They say that if confronted by an animal that has allowed you to get close to it , or has no problem with getting close to you , get the hell away as fast as you can because it may be rabid .
Franken objects to Lieberman taking a ' moment ' for extra Senate remarks
Your Browser DoesNot Support IFrames .
Updated 5:52 p.m.
By Joel Achenbach
Tensions flared in the Senate during an otherwise slow afternoon Thursday when Sen .
Joe Lieberman asked for unanimous consent to extend some remarks on health care for " an additional moment . "
He did n't get it .
Lieberman , the independent from Connecticut , has in recent days infuriated his fellow members of the Democratic caucus by nixing any form of public health insurance in the Senate health - care reform bill under consideration .
His actions have particularly enraged liberals , one of whom , Sen .
Al Franken , the freshman Democrat from Minnesota , happened to taking his turn presiding over the Senate when Lieberman made his request to extend his allotted 10 minutes .
" In my capacity as the senator from Minnesota , I object , " Franken said .
" Really ? " Lieberman said , clearly shocked .
He chuckled .
" Okay , " Lieberman said , as if talking to himself .
" Do n't take it personally . "
Moments later , Sen. John McCain , the Arizona Republican who had Lieberman 's energetic support during the 2008 presidential campaign , expressed outrage at what he'd just witnessed .
" I do n't know what 's happening here in this body , but I think it 's wrong , " McCain said .
" I 'll tell you , I have never seen a member denied an extra minute or so , as the chair just did . "
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) quickly corrected McCain , saying that the same thing happened earlier in the afternoon .
He was referring to an attempt by Sen. John Cornyn of Texas ( R. ) to extend remarks by two minutes .
Mark Begich ( D - Alaska ) was presiding at that moment , and objected .
When Cornyn pointed out that there was no one else waiting to speak in the nearly empty chamber and demanded an explanation for Begich 's objection , Begich backed down and Cornyn proceeded .
McCain , however , had missed that exchange .
" I just have n't seen it before myself , and I do n't like it and I think it 's -- it harms the comity of the Senate not to allow one of our members at least a minute , " McCain said .
Lieberman laughed off the incident as much ado about nothing when he returned to the chamber a couple of hours later .
He said that Franken apparently was following procedures for sticking to time limits that had been handed down by Senate leaders .
Franken had made a good - natured gesture with his hands , Lieberman said , " as if to say ' There 's nothing I can do ' . "
Lieberman said he appreciated his good friend McCain coming to his defense .
" No hard feelings , " he said .
The 1991 Science paper by Friis - Christensen & Lassen , work by Henrik Svensmark ( Physical Review Letters ) , and calculations done by Scafetta & West ( in the journals Geophysical Research Letters , Journal of Geophysical Research , and Physics Today ) have inspired the idea that the recent warming is due to changes in the sun , rather than greenhouse gases .
We have discussed these papers before here on RealClimate ( here , here , and here ) , and I think it ’s fair to say that these studies have been fairly influential one way or the other .
But has anybody ever seen the details of the methods used , or the data ?
I believe that a full disclosure of their codes and data would really boost the confidence in their work , if they were sound .
So if they believe so strongly that their work is solid , why not more transparency ?
There is a recent story in the British paper The Independent , where Friis - Christensen and Svensmark responded to the criticism forwarded by Peter Laut ( here ) .
All this would perhaps be unnecessary if they had disclosed their codes and data .
Gavin and I published a paper in Journal of Geophysical Research , where we tested the general approach used by Scafetta & West , and tried to repeat their analysis .
We were up - front about our lack of success in a 100 % replication of their work , but we argue that the any pronounced effect – as claimed by Scafetta & West – should be detectable even if the set - up is not 100 % identical .
However , Scafetta does not accept our analysis and has criticized me for lacking knowledge about wavelet analysis – he tells me to read the text books .
So I asked him to post his code openly on the Internet so that others could repeat our test with their code .
That should settle our controversy .
After repeated requests , he told me that he does n’t really understand why I ’m not able to write my own program to reproduce the calculations ( actually , I did in the paper together with Gavin , but Scafetta would n’t accept our analysis ) , and keeps insulting me by telling me to take a course on wavelet analysis .
Furthermore , he stated that there “ are several other and even more serious problems ” in our work .
I figure then that the easiest way to get to the bottom of this issue it to repeat our tests with his code .
A replication in general does n’t require full disclosure of source code because the description in the paper should be sufficient , though in this case it clearly was n’t .
So to both save having us do it again and perhaps miss some other little detail – in addition to using an algorithm that Scafetta is happy with – it ’s worth getting the code with which to validate our efforts .
It should be a common courtesy to provide methods requested by other scientists in order to speedily get to the essence of the issue , and not to waste time with the minutiae of which year is picked to end the analysis .
The reason why Gavin and I were not able to repeat Scafetta ’s analysis in exact details is that his papers did n’t disclose all the necessary details .
The first point he raised was that we used periodic instead of reflection boundaries .
The fact that the paper referred to the expression ‘ 1/2 A sin ( 2 pi t ) ’ to describe the temperatures or solar forcing would normally suggest that they used periodic rather than reflection boundaries .
There was no information in the paper about reflection boundary .
But this is no big deal , as we have subsequently repeated the analysis with reflection boundary , and that does n’t alter our conclusions .
After further communication , we found out that Scafetta re-sampled the data in such a way that the center of the wavelet band pass filter was located exactly on the 11 and 22 year solar cycles , which were the frequencies of interest .
He also informed me that a reasonable choice of the year when the reflection boudary was made should be the year 2002 - 3 when the sun experienced a maximum for both the 11 and 22 year cycles .
This information was not provided in the papers .
I ’m no psychic , so I could n’t have guessed that all this was needed to reproduce his result .
But since Scafetta has lost faith in my ability to repeat his work , I think it ’s even a greater reason to disclose his code so that others can have a go .
For the record , we did not just use wavelets to filter the data – we obtained the same conclusion with an ordinary band - pass filter .

But that 's the problem with sexism .
It does n't happen because people -- male or female -- think women suck .
It happens for the same reason a sommelier always pours a little more in a man 's wine glass ( check it ! ) , or that that big , hearty man in the suit seems like he'd be a better manager .
It 's not that women should n't be up for the big awards .
It 's just that when it comes down to the wire , we just kinda feel like men . . .
I do n't know . . . deserve them .
The conservatives are right : affirmative action is huge blemish on the face of our nation .
And until we stop giving awards to men who do n't deserve them over women who do , we 're sunk .
Because our default is to somehow feel like Philip Roth 's output is impressive while Joyce Carol Oates ' is a punchline .
Our default is to call John Updike a genius on the basis of four very wonderful books and many truly weird ones , while Margaret Atwood , with the same track record , is simply beloved .
Our default is to title Ayelet Waldman 's book , " Bad Mother , " while her husband 's is " Manhood for Amateurs . "
Our default is that women are small , men are universal .
Well , I know men get sensitive if you call them small .
But gentlemen , sometimes you are .

" It did not look like what we thought discrimination looked like . "
This one sentence from the study , in particular , stood out to me , and it's how I 've begun to think of all the small things that happen individually that on the surface seem like they could not possibly be discrimination .
When I read the quote above , I thought of this study on gender discrimination in Academe and how difficult it can be to detect :

Is it better to walk a human or to walk a dog ?
New research from the University of Missouri has found that people who walk dogs are more consistent about regular exercise and show more improvement in fitness than people who walk with a human companion .
In a 12 - week study of 54 older adults at an assisted living home , 35 people were assigned to a walking program for five days a week , while the remaining 19 served as a control group .
Among the walkers , 23 selected a friend or spouse to serve as a regular walking partner along a trail laid out near the home .
Another 12 participants took a bus daily to a local animal shelter where they were assigned a dog to walk .
To the surprise of the researchers , the dog walkers showed a big improvement in fitness , while the human walkers began making excuses to skip the workout .
Walking speed among the dog walkers increased by 28 percent , compared with just a 4 percent increase among the human walkers .
“ What happened was nothing short of remarkable , ” said Rebecca A. Johnson , a nursing professor and director of the Research Center for Human Animal Interaction at the University of Missouri ’s College of Veterinary Medicine .
“ The improvement in walking speed means their confidence in their walking ability had increased and their balance had increased .
To have a 28 percent improvement in walking speed is mind boggling . ”
Ms. Johnson said that because some people are afraid of dogs , the participants were given the choice of walking with a human or a dog as the companion .
Ms. Johnson said the dog walkers were far more consistent in sticking with the program than those who were walking with humans .
“ In the human walking group , they were regularly discouraging each other from walking , ” she said .
“ Missouri is a hot state .
We would hear them saying : ‘ It ’s hot today .
I do n’t want to walk , do you ? ’ ”
The response from participants in the dog - walking group — and their dog companions — was very different .
“ When the people came to the animal shelter , they bounced off the bus and said , ‘ Where ’s my dog ? ” ’
Ms. Johnson said .
“ And the dogs never gave any discouragement from walking . ”
Ms. Johnson said she suspects differences will show up in other areas , like depression and anxiety , although that data are still under review and the final study has not yet been published .
But there were also other subtle indicators of improvement among the dog - walking group .
Many people in the dog - walking group stopped using canes and walkers .
“ They would say , ‘ Now I ’m physically fit enough to take my dog for a walk , ” ’ Ms. Johnson said .
Sometimes because of the nature of my work I get to hear stories from a greybeard with a past that is , well , " interesting . "
And again , because of the nature of my work , or more accurately , because of the nature of their work , the stories can't be verified .
That 's just life .
Sometimes the stories can't even be told .
But some , after time , can .
I 'm starting to write them up , and this is one of them .
Once upon a time most hackers knew about the infamous IBM " Black Team " .
In case you do n't , I suggest you go read about them first , before you carry on here : The Black Team ( That should open in a new window or tab - just close it when you 're done . )
So let me tell you a story involving a member of the Black Team .
This has come to me 13th hand , so I can't vouch for its veracity , but I can believe it .
Oh yes , I can believe it .
There was a programmer at IBM who was terribly excited to get the job writing the driver / interface software for a brand spanking new tape - drive .
This was one of the fascinating machines - cabinet sized - that you might see in movies from the 60s , 70s and beyond .
Reel to reel tape , running forward , then backwards , stopping , starting , no apparent reason for the direction , speed or duration .
Almost hypnotic .
Maybe I should write a simulator as a screen - saver .
Hmm ...
Anyway , our programmer was very excited by the idea of writing the software for this new piece of hardware , but also a little anxious .
After all , his work would attract the attention of the Black Team , something no programmer ever really wanted .
So he decided to thwart them .
He decided to write his code perfectly .
He decided to prove the code , formally .
He decided to write code that was so clean , so neat , so perfect , that nothing wrong could be found with it .
There are two ways to write code : write code so simple there are obviously no bugs in it , or write code so complex that there are no obvious bugs in it .
-- C.A.R. Hoare
He worked really hard at getting this code perfect , and the time came for a member of the Black Team to inspect his code and test his software , they found no bugs .
None !
And they were annoyed .
They came back .
At first in twos and threes , but finally the entire team descended on him and his code to find the bugs they simply knew must be there , all to no avail .
So our programmer was happy , content , confident , and above all , smug .
So the day came when the hardware was to be unveiled and demonstrated to the world .
This sort of event was always a big one .
" New Hardware " was a big deal , and duly trumpeted .
Then , at the last minute before the demonstration began , a member of the Black Team hurried up to the console and began frantically typing in commands .
Our programmer was confident - he knew the code was perfect .
It was proven and tested .
Nothing could go wrong .
He was n't even perturbed when the tape started spinning at full speed and running right to the end .
It stopped before the end , as he knew it would .
It was safe , it was working , it was perfect .
The tape then started to rewind at full speed , but that was n't a problem either .
Again , it stopped just short of the end .
No problem .
Again and again the tape ran all the way to the end , then all the way to the start .
Again and again it stopped within tolerances .
Our programmer smirked , knowing the Black Team were beaten .
And then he saw it .
The cabinet had started to build up a gentle , rocking motion .
And it was growing .
What could be happening ?
The Black Team had found the fundamental frequency at which the cabinet would rock , and had programmed the tape to resonate .
In mounting horror , matching the mounting amplitude , the programmer watch as the cabinet at first subtly , then clearly , and finally unmistakably began rocking ever more violently , until finally , inevitably , it fell over .
In front of the World 's press .
History does n't relate what happened to the programmer , or to the product .
Despite the tale being utterly believable , I 've been able to find no record of it .
The greybeard who told me the story has moved on to a place where I can no longer ask questions , and so I 'm left with what might just be a tall tale .
Surely there would survive some report of this event , some record , somewhere .
Do you have a copy ?
They may look like just elaborate models of Christian , Jewish and Islamic holy places , but Al Farrow ’s artworks have a much deeper meaning .
Al Farrow ’s Religious Trifecta : A Synagogue , a Cathedral and a Mosque tries to reinterpret three of the world ’s major religions according to their political , military and cultural history .
As you surely know , religion played a major role in some of the greatest conflicts in history and that ’s what the artist is trying to emphasize through his models .
Built with used gun components , bullets and steel shots , these unusual holy places reveal the violent side of religion .
Al Farrow ‘s steel masterpieces are displayed at the de Young Museum , in San Francisco .

At an impromptu meeting in Moura village on the south - eastern coast of Bangladesh last week , 30 families said that their only hope of survival was to become climate refugees .
" The tides come into the village every two weeks .
Twenty years ago the sea was far away .
Now it 's a few yards and we fear that our children will die .
We have lost our farmland and more than 50 people have already lost their homes to the rising sea .
The drinking water is salty and there are no fish in the river .
We all want to leave but where ?
We have no money , " said Hayaun Nesa Khatong .
At the rate that this stretch of the Bangladesh coast is being submerged there is little or no chance of Moura or many other nearby villages being habitable in five years .
Unless the local government finds increasingly scarce land to evacuate them to , the villagers will have no option but to migrate .
Most will go to the slums of Chittagong , 20 miles away , or to the capital Dhaka .
Five hundred miles away in India , on the other side of the Bay of Bengal , researchers in the oceanography department at the University of Jadavpur in Kolkata say dozens of islands in the Indian Sunderban region are being regularly flooded , threatening thousands .
Unexpectedly fast sea level rises and storms are forcing the Indian government to consider evacuating nearly 70,000 people in the next five years .
These are people which developing countries have been saying privately that rich countries must take responsibility for .
Now , ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit , Bangladeshi finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has raised the stakes by stating the point publicly .
" We are asking our development partners to honour the natural right of persons to migrate .
We ca n't accommodate all these people . "
Rich nations could help by providing cash to relocate refugees in their own countries , or by accepting them as refugees .
Wealthy countries are terrified by the thought of climate refugees being given legal access .
Worldwide , nearly 10 m people from Africa , south Asia and elsewhere are thought to have migrated or been displaced by environmental degradation , weather - related disasters and desertification in the last 20 years .
The UN expects a further 150 m people will have to move in the next 50 years .
Climate change cannot be unequivocally linked to individual weather events and specific mass migrations .
But experts , including the UN 's climate change science body and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say warming is increasing the number and severity of humanitarian disasters .
The International Red Cross estimates there are now more than 400 weather - related disasters a year and almost 90 m people need immediate assistance .
This figure could be as high as 350 m by 2050 .
The majority of people displaced by more severe climates will be the extreme poor , whose meagre resources will mean moving within borders , often only short distances from home .
But the UN says 28 countries are now at extreme risk from climate change , of which 22 are in Africa .
Eleven countries have more than 10 % of their land within 5 m of mean sea level and a similar number have all of their territory below 5 m .
Five would be entirely threatened by just a 1 m rise in sea level .
Because most borders between both African and Asian countries are relatively porous , there is a distinct possibility that tens of thousands of people will try to migrate between countries .
Bangladesh , which is expecting its 165 m population to increase by nearly 100 m in the next 60 years , is the most vulnerable large country , with 60 % of its land less than 5 m above sea level .
Two Phoenix police officers have been fired after an internal report revealed inappropriate sexual advances against a woman .
Phoenix radio station KTAR says the incident occurred last July .
The internal investigation report obtained by KTAR says Phoenix police Officers Michel Cruz and John Urban stopped a bikini - clad woman after she fled from a rear - end collision .
The report said the officers handcuffed the woman , drove her back to the accident scene for paperwork , then drove her to a secluded spot at an elementary school , where Cruz allegedly fondled her .
The alleged victim claimed she was handcuffed , that contact was not consensual and that Urban watched without doing anything to stop it .
The report said the woman was given a ticket and dropped off at a nearby store .
Most of the leading buyers of American military hardware in 2008 had two characteristics in common : they speak Arabic and their governments are opposed to democracy and basic freedoms .
Information compiled by the Congressional Research Service revealed that the biggest recipients of U.S. arms sales last year were ( in order ) : the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , Saudi Arabia , Morocco , Iraq and Egypt .
With the exception of the popularly - elected government in Baghdad , all of these American military partners are ruled by autocratic or theocratic regimes .
The leading defense contractors manufacturing the weapons for these governments are Boeing , Lockheed Martin , Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics , and Raytheon .
Earlier this month , the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the potential for $ 2.2 billion of new weapons sales to Arab dictatorships , in particular $ 1.2 billion worth to Hosni Mubarak ’s Egypt for air - to - surface missiles , anti-ship missiles , aircraft engines , and Fast Missile Crafts ( FMC ) .
The rest of the proposed weapons sales are for the royal families of Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and the UAE .

This season 's fashion in conspiracy theories — for those out of the loop of enlightenment — concerns health .
The Web sites , marginal cable shows and radio phone - ins are full of tales about how Big Pharma and Bad Government are deliberately spreading diseases or manufacturing scares in order to sell us expensive drugs , gull us into dangerous vaccinations or just simply to create an atmosphere of panic which will allow " them " to take over .
Swine flu ?

The year 2009 can be marked as one of the most defining years for Yanko Design and its community .
The year can be re-capped with the Best of 2009 , but on the same note it ’s important to iterate our accomplishments .
When the world was facing its worst global recession in decades , ( including the design industry as a whole ) , YD on its part grew its outlook by innovating to stay ahead of the game .
For a moment you can actually say that Innovation has been the theme symbolic to YD and this year ’s best designs .
I am equally proud of every member in the YD family .
The team took initiatives and spearheaded projects that added value in every sense of the word .
The Job Board has proven to be more effective in landing positions v/s recruitment and agencies .
The YD Store made business sense to us but it made a stronger statement for the individual designers .
It gave them freedom to focus on creativity , while YD Store took care of bringing those products to the design advocates .
The equation is perfect ; the designers get to do what they ’re passionate about , while YD realizes their inspirations .
With our readers ranging from the creative industry ( industrial , graphics design , interior , fashion design , ect ) to the traditional industry ( info tech , finance , entertainment , marketing , manufacturing , ect ) , we can proudly say that we have one of the most vocal communities where voices are heard .
The innovations that you see on YD are all a result of those suggestions .
This includes the interviews , reviews & Podcasts .
To sum it up , we ’ve had a pretty innovative year , and we hope next year will be bigger , better and brighter for all of us !
Merry Christmas & Happy New Year !

Those magical pony tails bugged the hell out of me .
That , aside from the predictable and formulaic plot , was the most frustrating part of the film .
I mean , we can't even get a universal cell phone charger but this world has managed to evolve this cross-species universal connector ?
I spent the first hour and a half of the movie just looking at all the things in the universe that did n't make sense evolutionary .
Spinning , light up lizards ?
Easy prey .
Light up plants ?
Waste of energy .
Sentiment network of trees ?
Trees do n't have the ability to move so increased intelligence does n't do a whole lot for them .
But those plugs were worst .
It allowed the horses and dragons to be enslaved , pretty much .
I mean , the dragon goes from hating Jake Sully to complete obedience once he plugged in to him .
I 'd have to think any dragon that does n't have a built - in tool for domestication would have an advantage .
Plus , how could so many species all evolve to the same form ?
It 's too complex to be a leftover from before they diverged and it was n't even shown being used with two members of the same species ( except for sex , apparently .
If that 's the evolutionary function of these things , then the movie suddenly became infinitely creepier .
And the loin clothes make no sense . )
Oh , and one other thing :
The society of the Na'vi was ridiculously similar to human society .
I mean , chimpanzees have 98 % of our DNA , but when a chimp shows its teeth , it signals danger .
So what are the odds an independent alien species has all of the exact same facial expressions as humans ?
And yes , I realize this is a movie and artistic license is given .
I know it would n't work if they had different methods of kissing or counting then humans .
But I still feel like James Cameron wanted us to accept that this world could somewhere exist in the universe , and it really could n't .
The movie presents itself in the context of science fiction , but it is much closer to fantasy .
I would have been much happier if they had arrived by wardrobe , not spaceship .
WASHINGTON  Nasty charges of bribery .
Senators cut off midspeech .
Accusations of politics put over patriotism .
Talk of double - crosses .
A nonagenarian forced to the floor after midnight for multiple procedural votes .
In the heart of the holiday season , Senate Republicans and Democrats are at one another ’s throats as the health care overhaul reaches its climactic votes .
A year that began with hopes of new post - partisanship has indeed produced change :
Things have gotten worse .
Enmity and acrimony are coursing through a debate with tremendous consequences for both sides as well as for the legislative agenda in the months ahead .
Should Democrats prevail , it will put an exclamation point on an eventful first year of their control of Congress and the White House and leave Republicans on the Napoleonic side of what one predicted could be President Obama ’s Waterloo .
A Republican victory would invigorate an opposition party that was back on its heels at the beginning of 2009 and would strike a crushing blow to Democrats and their claims to governing .
Boehner still hates ' garlic milkshakes '
The garlic lobby is n't going to be happy .
After checking out the Senate 's 2,074 page health care bill released last night , Minority Leader John Boehner has reprised his now famous ( infamous ? ) punch line .
" The American people have soundly rejected this , " Boehner said Thursday morning .
" And I told you several months ago how popular it was .
It 's as popular as a garlick milkshake . "
We 've never tried a garlic milkshake , but the good folks in Gilroy , Calif. , site of the annual Garlic Festival , serve garlic ice cream every year .
And they took a shot at Boehner last time he made such a reference .
Brian Bowe , the executive director of the garlic festival , told Greg Sargent over at The Plum Line last month : “ I would invite him [ Boehner ] to our festival and would urge him to try the garlic ice cream .
It ’s the longest line of people at the festival every year .
Everyone loves it . "
One thing is clear :
The Senate 's garlic milkshake is a bit smaller and less expensive than the House version , if you believe the CBO .

It has long been obvious that Vladimir Putin  the current prime minister and former president of Russia  craves his dominant hold on power .
Still , it was disconcerting to hear him signal publicly on Thursday that he might seek the presidency again in 2012 .
Mr. Putin displayed a master politician ’s coyness in addressing the issue at a public forum where he took scores of questions .
Would he run again ?
“ I ’ll think about it , ” he replied .
Asked at another point if it was time to relax after decades of government service , he said : “ Do n’t hold your breath . ”
A lot could happen between now and then .
Politicians change their minds all the time .
Mr. Putin could decide to stay as prime minister and have his sidekick , Dmitri Medvedev , the current president , run again for president .
At a minimum , Mr. Putin may be encouraging speculation about his political future to enhance his influence  or to divert attention from more important matters like economic reform or the demographic crisis facing Russia .
Whether or not the two men trade jobs or try to keep the ones they have , Mr. Putin  who first became president in 2000 and would be eligible to run again in 2012  could conceivably stay in power until at least 2024 .

Like everything else in life , the BDSM community is a variation of degrees .
There is what is considered " light bondage " which is at the less severe end of the spectrum .
Going to the opposite extreme , we find hardcore M/s relationships where nothing is off limits .
And , of course , there are variations in between .
The question is , where do you fit ?
Many seem to picture the extreme in their mind .
This is due to the fact that this side of the lifestyle is promoted through imagery online .
Websites like to go for the " shock value " when promoting their goods and services .
Nevertheless , there is some basis in reality for what they promote .
The Master / slave relationship is considered one of the more extreme aspects of this way of life .
At the core of this interaction is the complete exchange of power .
Those who choose to engage in this particular flavor need to be aware of the limitations ( or lack thereof ) .
Many claim to be slave material yet fail miserably when asked to do something .
This is why it is important to know where you fit .
I wrote on a number of occasions how I believe only a few are truly cut out to be slaves .
A cruise around different chat rooms quickly reveals the fantasy many are engaging in .
While they claim that living real time M/s is their dream , they fail to realize what that entails .
If one is open to dwelling in the extreme , one better be prepared for what that is like .
Sadly , few do .
A true M/s relationship means that the Master ( or Mistress ) is to be obeyed at all times .
There is no limit to what one is willing to do .
There is debate within the lifestyle of whether there is such a thing as hard limits or not .
For practicality sake , I am going to omit this argument and presume there are some hard limits .
However , they exist , in my mind , only as to the psychological damage they can cause .
In the end , physical pain and lack of interest do not qualify as a hard limits .
Are you willing to do whatever you are told ?
Again , this is the foundation of M/s. Will you obey the directives of the one you submit to without question ?
Are you willing to suffer the consequences as a result of being disobedient ?
Can you be trusted to respect the tenets of this relationship while living under his or her domain ?
Here are some of the actual directions I have heard given to a slave over the years : - having sex with animals - piecing oneself - being branded - sexually satisfying a homeless guy (s ) - being ignored for weeks on end - eating shit / drinking piss - engaging in suspension - not cumming for over a year - sleeping in a cage or on the floor - living like a dog ( or pony ) - having to give up your career / job - all possessions given up including children - exposing yourself on demand regardless of where and whom is around - being passed around sexually for the pleasure of others - watching your Master or Mistress with others - Being humiliated in public - Getting embarrassing tattoos - Engaging in homosexual sex acts when you are straight - physical pain include cbt , titty torture , whippings , and paddlings - Partaking in electrical , needle , and medical playAll these activities were actually directed at a slave .
Could you fulfill these if asked ?
Are you sitting there stating " No , I would never do that " ?
If so , you might want to look at the choices you make .
The M/s lifestyle is not for the faint of heart .
It is considered extreme for a reason .
The comeback I often hear is that " I will not get with someone who is into those things " .
My reply is simply " that is not your choice " .
A Master ( Mistress ) is in complete control .
Whatever he or she desires is your course of action .
Over time , that person can evolve and develop whatever interests he or she chooses .
Are you ready to accept what they are ?
I surmise that most " online slaves " are ill - prepared for this reality .
BDSM is not a romantic fairy - tale .
It is the lifestyle answer for many of us .
However , people will get into trouble when they try to make it into something it is not .
The story of Cinderella was already written .
BDSM relationships might have the romantic component .
Then again , they might not .
It is up to the Master ( Mistress ) to decide .
The Mayo Clinic Foundation has determined that 24 slaughterhouse workers who fell ill from 2006 to 2008 were experiencing an autoimmune response caused by the inhalation of pig brain tissue mist .
The study , published in the Lancet Neurology , found that all 24 workers who had worked near high powered air compressors used to extract brains from pig heads , developed polyradiculoneuropathy which is a painful inflammatory disorder affecting the peripheral nerves and the spine nerve roots .
" The neurological disorder described is autoimmune in origin and is related to occupational exposure to multiple aerosolised porcine brain tissue antigens .
The pattern of nerve involvement suggests vulnerability of nerve roots and terminals where the blood -- nerve barrier is most permeable . "
Mayo Clinic neurologist James Dyck told Wired Magazine , " When you 're breathing in pig brain tissue , your body develops an antibody against it .
There 's enough overlap between pig brains and human brains that it was a problem . "
All of the patients have improved since being removed from the slaughterhouse environment and being treated at the Mayo Clinic .
It was determined that other workers in the factory had antibodies in their systems indicating exposure to the aerosolized pig brains but did not develop any sickness .
In 2007 , the factory shut down the pig brain processing center and no new cases of polyradiculoneuropathy have been reported .

The United States government might have a bigger budget to work with -- if one bodybuilding governor would pay the back taxes it appears he never got around to paying .
According to documents filed in L.A. County Superior Court , Arnold Schwarzenegger owes the IRS $ 39,047 from 2004 and $ 40,016 from 2005 .
In total the Guv owes $ 79,064.00 ... and as we all know , he 's definitely not saving the money for rainy day traffic violations .
An official at the L.A. County Recorder 's Office tells TMZ their system shows the lien is still active .
Arnold 's rep released the following statement : " No one , including the IRS , has notified the governor of any issues whatsoever with his taxes .
We are contacting the IRS to determine if the document in question , which appears to be a penalty for missing info and not for unpaid taxes , is legitimate and if there is any discrepancy to resolve . "
Carol Rosenberg at the Miami Herald broke the news on Saturday that 12 prisoners have been released from Guantánamo , bringing the total number of prisoners held to 198 .
The news followed hints in the Washington Post on Friday that six Yemenis and four Afghans were set to leave , but Rosenberg — and the East African media — reported that the men had already been freed and that two Somalis were also released .
I ’ll be writing soon about the Afghans and the Yemenis , but for now I ’d like to focus on the stories of the two Somalis : Mohammed Sulaymon Barre and Ismail Mahmoud Muhammad ( identified as Ismael Arale ) .
Rosenberg reported that the two men “ were processed by the Somaliland government and then released to rejoin their families in Hargeisa , ” the capital of “ the breakaway region in northern Somalia that has its own autonomous government . ”
She added , “ The United States does not recognize the government in Somaliland and there were no official statements on how Arale and Barre arrived there .
A local newspaper , the Somaliland Press , said they arrived aboard a jet provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross , suggesting that the United States had released the men to the Red Cross in a third country . ”
As President Obama attempts to close Guantánamo , with the administration recently announcing its intention of purchasing a prison in Illinois to hold some of the prisoners , the release of these two men — as with the overwhelming majority of releases from Guantánamo — yet again demonstrates how hysterical and unsubstantiated are Republican claims that Guantánamo is full of hardcore terrorists , as their stories demonstrate :
Seized in Pakistan : Mohammed Sulaymon Barre
Mohammed Sulaymon Barre , who was 37 years old at the time of his capture , was one of the first men to be seized in the “ War on Terror . ”
As I explained in my book The Guantánamo Files , he had been living in Pakistan as a UN - approved refugee since fleeing his homeland during its ruinous civil war in the early 1990s , and was seized at his home in Karachi on November 1 , 2001 “ by police and intelligence agents who had made two previous visits to check his papers , and who seem , therefore , to have seized him on this third occasion because they were looking for easy targets to hand over to the Americans . ”
As I also explained in The Guantánamo Files :
Barre worked from his home as the Karachi agent for the Dahabshiil Company , a Somali organization with branches around the world , which provides essential money transfer operations for the Somali diaspora .
According to the Americans , Dahabshiil was “ closely related to al - Barakat , a Somali financial company designated as a terrorism finance facilitator , ” [ which had been added to a US terrorism watch list and had its assets frozen ] .
Barre said that he knew nothing about this allegation , pointing out that his job only involved making small transactions on behalf of Somalis living in Pakistan .
In fact , as was noted in a report in 2004 [ for a UN conference on Trade and Development ] , the enforced US - led closure of money transfer operations with suspected links to terrorism was “ disastrous for Somalia , a country with no recognized government and without a functioning state apparatus .
After the international community largely washed its hands of the country following the disastrous peacekeeping foray in 1994 , remittances became the inhabitants ’ lifeline .
With no recognized private banking system , the remittance trade was dominated by a single firm ( al - Barakat ) . ”
Crucially , the report added that , although the US authorities closed down al - Barakat in 2001 , labeling it “ the quartermasters of terror , ” only four criminal prosecutions had been filed by 2003 , “ and none involved charges of aiding terrorists . ”
Nevertheless , the authorities at Guantánamo — operating in a bubble of terror - related allegations that largely bore no relation to the realities of the outside world — had no time for Barre ’s protestations of innocence .
“ I am convinced that your branch of the Dahabshiil company was used to transfer money for terrorism , ” the presiding officer of his tribunal at Guantánamo told Barre in 2005 .
“ What I am trying to find out is if you think maybe there were some people that were using your company and using your branch to transfer money , or whether you were just totally not paying attention . ”
A year later , as the BBC reported in August 2006 , al - Barakat had been removed from the US watchlist of terrorist organizations .
The report explained that al - Barakat had been included on the watchlist because US intelligence analysts thought it had been used to finance the 9/11 hijackers , but the 9/11 Commission had investigated the claim and had found it baseless .
In February 2009 , in a report for the Washington Post , Peter Finn noted that , in the allegations against Barre at Guantánamo , Dahabshiil ’s alleged ties to al - Barakat had been dropped by 2006 , although even then the taint of the allegation was not entirely removed .
In a letter to the Post , an attorney for Dahabshiil was obliged to point out that the firm has “ never been the subject of any investigation in relation to alleged terrorist funding ” and that it “ has no involvement whatsoever with money laundering or the funding or of terrorist organizations and … places the highest importance on money laundering compliance . ”
As the Post noted ruefully , “ Dahabshiil should have been given an opportunity to comment for the article . ”
Shorn of this central allegation , it is no wonder that , as Barre ’s lawyers explained in a court filing in connection with his habeas corpus petition , the allegations against him have “ varied dramatically . ”
In 2006 , for example , presumably through a false allegation coerced from some other prisoner , the authorities claimed that he was not in Pakistan in 1994 and 1995 — despite the existence of UN papers documenting his meetings in Pakistan in those years — but was actually working in Osama bin Laden ’s compound in Khartoum , Sudan , an allegation so worthless that his lawyers described it as “ implausible and unsubstantiated . ”
According to Emi MacLean of the Center for Constitutional Rights , which represents Barre , most of his problems at Guantánamo stemmed from his opposition to the regime at prison , and his involvement in several hunger strikes .
“ If you were detained for seven years without charge and any fair process , you might be engaged in activities that would be considered disciplinary violations that are really protests for your detention , ” she said .
The truth , as Barre himself noted at his tribunal in 2005 , was that “ A lot of interrogators said to me that … a lot of mistakes were made and they must be corrected .
They told me many times that I am here by mistake . ”
Sadly , this was not enough to prevent him from suffering in Guantánamo , and also in US custody in Bagram before his transfer to Guantánamo in 2002 , when , as he explained in his tribunal :
They interrogated me and one of the interrogators told me I was from al - Wafa [ a Saudi charity that was also regarded with suspicion by the US authorities ] and I needed to confess to that .
You have no choice .
I told them it was n’t true .
They pressured me .
They whispered something then spoke to the guard .
The guard came in , grabbed me by my neck and threw me .
He took me in a bad way to isolation .
All my blankets , except one , were taken from me .
It was freezing cold .
They did n’t feed me lunch and sometimes they did n’t feed me twice .
At night it is very cold and if you do n’t eat dinner it gets colder .
This torture lasted fifteen to twenty days .
My feet and hands were swollen .
I was n’t able to stand because I was in so much pain .
I asked for treatment and an interrogator brought a nurse and asked if I wanted treatment .
They told me they could cut my legs to stop the pain .
They did this so I would confess to the accusations that I did n’t do .
Nothing happened .
After the torture ended , I met another interrogator who told me injustice was done to me and I did n’t have anything to do with this .
He said he would do a report so I could go home .
He told me I would be released .
Suddenly , I was taken back to Kandahar and then to Cuba .
Seized in Djibouti : Ismail Mahmoud Muhammad
Unlike Mohammed Sulaymon Barre , Ismail Mahmoud Muhammad was one of the last prisoners to arrive at Guantánamo , one of just six men flown to the prison after the arrival of 14 “ high - value detainees ” in September 2006 .
Identified by the Pentagon as Abdullahi Sudi Arale , he arrived with little fanfare in June 2007 , and , as I explained in an article in September 2007 :
Possibly … his arrival was little trumpeted because it involved the deliberately under - reported “ War on al - Qaeda ” in the Horn of Africa , and because the administration had very little information to offer about him .
In almost questioning terms , Arale was described as a “ suspected ” member of “ the al - Qaeda terrorist network in East Africa , ” who served as “ a courier between East Africa al - Qaeda ( EAAQ ) and al - Qaeda in Pakistan . ”
In a press release , the DoD added that , after returning to Somalia from Pakistan in September 2006 , he “ held a leadership role in the EAAQ - affiliated Somali Council of Islamic Courts ( CIC ) , ” and noted , with distressing vagueness , that there was “ significant information available ” to indicate that Arale had been “ assisting various EAAQ - affiliated extremists in acquiring weapons and explosives , ” that he had “ facilitated terrorist travel by providing false documents for AQ and EAAQ - affiliates and foreign fighters traveling into Somalia , ” and that he had “ played a significant role in the re-emergence of the CIC in Mogadishu . ”
Unmentioned , of course , was the subtext of the situation in Somalia : the role of the CIC in returning some semblance of order to one of the world ’s least - governed countries , and the US government ’s use of Ethiopia as a proxy army in yet another secret , dirty war .
It took some time for the truth about the Pentagon ’s “ distressing vagueness ” to be explained , in part because the US authorities released no further information about him , and , in two and a half years , do not appear to have conducted a Combatant Status Review Tribunal , to ascertain whether he was correctly designated as an “ enemy combatant . ”
However , when Reprieve , the legal action charity whose lawyers represent dozens of Guantánamo prisoners , became involved , another narrative emerged , in which Muhammad not only had no connection to al - Qaeda , but was , in fact , “ an English teacher and centrist political activist . ”
Born in Mogadishu in 1970 , Muhammad had remained in the capital throughout the civil war of the 1990s until the security situation deteriorated to such an extent that he moved north to Somaliland , establishing the first English school in the new country , and working as a journalist .
In 1998 , he traveled to Pakistan , where he studied English Literature at the International Islamic University , and became , as Reprieve described it , “ a respected leader of the Somali community in the country . ”
When his father died , he moved back to Mogadishu , “ where the rule of the Union of Islamic Courts had brought relative stability to the war - torn capital , ” but at the end of 2006 , when , backed by the US , the Ethiopian Army invaded , he moved north one more .
Opposed to the Ethiopian invasion , he was asked , “ as a respected member of the community … to attend a conference in Eritrea aimed at organizing a political campaign ” to ensure that the Ethiopians left .
It was while he was on his way to this conference that he was seized by local police in Djibouti , “ apparently at the behest of the Americans . ”
Handed over to the US military , he was taken to Camp Lemonier , the US military base that played a key role in American interference in the Horn of Africa , where other prisoners have been held , possibly including an unknown number of “ ghost prisoners . ”
There , as Reprieve explained , “ he was held in a shipping container and interrogated by Americans . ”
Compared to Mohammed Sulaymon Barre , Ismael Mahmoud Muhammad was fortunate that his wrongful imprisonment lasted for only two and a half years , but as the eighth anniversary of the opening of Guantánamo approaches , the release of these two men — neither of whom was cleared until the Obama administration ’s inter-agency Task Force began its deliberations this year — demonstrates , yet again , that , when it comes to undoing the shameful legacy of Guantánamo , much work still remains to be done .

As he began to despair , on three separate nights as they came of age , bags of gold appeared in his home , seemingly tossed through a window or down the chimney as they slept , landing in shoes left by the fire .
You would n’t fly on a commercial jet plane unless you were confident that the pilot had logged some serious time in a flight simulator , preparing for every eventuality .
Someday it may be just as inconceivable to undergo delicate surgery without assurances that your doctor has taken a few practice runs on a three - dimensional , interactive simulation of your own anatomy .
Researchers at Stanford University are hastening that day by developing a training technology that allows doctors to rehearse surgical procedures before the patient reaches the operating room .
The demonstration project , called the Stanford Rhino­logical Virtual Surgical Environment ( VSE ) , uses a haptic interface — mechanical feedback that simulates the sense of touch — developed by SensAble Technologies of Woburn , Massachusetts .
The VSE system combines that interface with a set of detailed CT scans , taken before the operation , to create a digital “ body double ” of the patient .
Using the patient ’s own scans in the simulation could greatly assist doctors performing surgery near critical parts such as the optic nerve and carotid artery , where damage could cause permanent debilitation or death .
In such operations , knowing the precise quirks of an individual ’s anatomy is crucial to a successful outcome .
Kenneth Salisbury , a professor in Stanford ’s departments of computer science and surgery , says that tactile feedback combined with the personalized information gives the VSE system a big advantage over current medical training simulations that use virtual surgery .
“ Existing systems allow you to move surrogate instruments around , watch how they look on the screen , and learn to make movements in the correct direction , ” he says , adding , “ It starts to get more interesting when you add the feeling and the reaction of tissue . ”
The Stanford team has developed an enhanced haptic interface that can re-create essentially all of the physical challenges a surgeon would encounter in a procedure .
From a clinical point of view , though , plastic training mannequins will probably always be useful .
“ It ’s the same with an airplane , ” Salisbury says .
“ You want a simulated plane that looks and feels like the one you ’ll be flying . ”
Clinical trials of the VSE system are slated to take place over the next couple years .
HOW IT WORKS
Rendering of a surgeon 's work station for rehearsing sinus surgery with the assistance of haptic training technology .
| Image : Joshua Scott
A haptic - feedback device ( A ) operates in a way analogous to the graphics card in your computer monitor , but instead of creating an image , it renders the feeling of a physical object — in this case bone , cartilage , or a tumor .
“ Rather than controlling red , green , and blue pixels that are visible to the eye , the device controls the three - dimensional forces felt by the hand , ” says Daniel Chen , chief technology officer at SensAble Technologies .
To create models of patients ’ sinuses , multiple two - dimensional scans were taken of their sinus cavities to create a composite 3 - D display ( B ) that is viewable on a standard PC .
From the same data , physical mass , friction , and compliance properties are assigned to the anatomical parts within the sinus .
The virtual sinus is then engaged by the haptics device , an armlike series of joints containing lightweight motors connected to an endoscope - tipped stylus ( C ) .
The device contains optical encoders that link the stylus ’s movements with the image on the screen .
When the encoders sense that you have “ bumped ” into something , they signal the device to engage its motors so they respond with appropriate force .
When a surgeon grazes the wall of the virtual nose , he or she will feel soft resistance ; if the surgeon presses harder , the resistance will increase to mimic the feel of the underlying cartilage or bone .
Mass shooting at Fort Hood : collateral damage from Iraq and Afghanistan wars
7 November 2009
The mayhem at Fort Hood in Texas , which has left 13 men and women dead and 30 injured , is a byproduct of the brutal wars in the Middle East and Central Asia .
It is a form of “ collateral damage ” for which the American political and military establishment is ultimately responsible .
The US interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan have now lasted a combined 14 and a half years .
Not only is there no end in sight in either case , there is the prospect of the wars ’ expansion into Pakistan , with bloodier and more disastrous consequences .
The invasions have already led to the devastation of Iraqi and Afghan society , the deaths of as many as a million Iraqis alone , and thousands of Americans killed , or maimed .
The wars are not about democracy , overthrowing tyrants , or protecting the American people from terrorism .
The US ruling elite is waging these interventions to seize control of critical energy supplies , to strengthen its position vis à vis its rivals in Europe and Asia , to gain global hegemony through its military superiority .
The impact of these neo-colonial wars , including the moral impact of the enormous gulf between the “ official story ” and harsh reality , must find expression within sections of the US military itself .
To fight a predatory war against a hostile population is a demoralizing and inevitably brutalizing experience .
The alleged perpetrator at Fort Hood , Maj . Nidal M. Hasan , the son of Palestinian immigrant parents now both dead , spent most of his Army medical career at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington , DC .
For six years , from 2003 until last summer , he worked as a liaison between wounded soldiers and the hospital ’s psychiatric staff .
In that capacity , he dealt with severely wounded military personnel .
His aunt told the Washington Post that on the rare occasions “ when he spoke of his work in any detail … Hasan told her of soldiers wracked by what they had seen .
One patient had suffered burns to his face so intense ‘ that his face had nearly melted , ’ she said .
‘ He told us how upsetting that was to him . ’ ”
An op - ed piece in the Baltimore Sun by a Vietnam veteran and psychiatrist asks , only half - facetiously , “ Is post - traumatic stress disorder something you can catch from your patients like a virus ? ”
Hasan , a devout Muslim , apparently developed a fierce opposition to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
Promoted to the rank of major in May , he subsequently learned he was going to be deployed to Afghanistan .
He had hired a military lawyer and had been attempting to avoid being sent overseas and to leave the Army since September .
Hasan ’s aunt told the Post that the military “ would not let him leave even after he offered to repay ” the cost of his medical training .
His cousin commented to the media that Hasan was deeply traumatized about seeing wartime service .
“ We ’ve known for the last five years that that was probably his worst nightmare .
He would tell us how he hears horrific things [ from the wounded ] … that was probably affecting him psychologically . ”
Many factors combine to produce the sort of breakdown that Hasan obviously underwent , including the overall social and political atmosphere in the country .
A co-worker told reporters that Hasan was angry about American involvement in the ongoing wars , and that he “ was hoping Obama would pull troops out and that things would settle down , and when things were not going that way , he became more agitated and frustrated with the conflicts over there . ”
The imperviousness of the existing political system to the sentiments of the population , along with the resulting feelings of alienation and powerlessness , is no small contributor to apparently “ senseless ” violence .
Personal mental instability is undoubtedly an element .
Unmarried and without a girlfriend , a “ bookish loner , ” increasingly devoted to religion , Hasan had told relatives that “ the military was his life . ”
Bitter disappointment and a sense of betrayal as he discovered the true character of the occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan , and horror over the possibility of being compelled to participate in those wars , may well have pushed a psychologically vulnerable individual over the edge .
The media is already harping on one of its favorite themes whenever a mass shooting takes place in America : how did the authorities miss the “ warning signs ” ?
Indeed , there seem to have been numerous such signs in this case , including Hasan ’s alleged web site postings in defense of suicide bombers , and his frantic anxiety about deployment to Afghanistan .
On the one hand , the Army ’s apparent indifference to Hasan ’s state of mind gives some indication of the value the military command places on the work of its psychiatric staff , overworked and overwhelmed in any event as a result of the volume of mentally damaged Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans thrust into the system .
On the other , how is the military to pick out signs of a potential individual collapse , when there are so many indications of mass , collective breakdown ?
The Wall Street Journal reported November 3 , two days before the Fort Hood killings , that 16 US soldiers killed themselves in October , “ an unusually high monthly toll that is fueling concerns about the mental health of the nation ’s military personnel after more than eight years of continuous warfare . ”
The Journal notes that 134 active - duty soldiers had taken their lives so far in 2009 , putting “ the Army on pace to break last year ’s record of 140 . …
The number of Army suicides has risen by 37 % since 2006 , and last year , the suicide rate surpassed that of the US population for the first time . ”
More soldiers killed themselves in 2008 than at any time since the Pentagon began keeping track nearly three decades ago .
In late October , a National Guard soldier , who had served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan , home on a 15 - day leave , shot himself in the head in a Muncie , Indiana movie theater .
In July a 30 - year - old soldier was shot and killed by a fellow soldier at a party at Fort Hood , and in September a soldier shot and killed a lieutenant at the base , before killing himself ( Fort Hood , the largest military installation in the world , has suffered more than 500 combat deaths and 75 suicides since 2001 ) .
In Baghdad earlier this year , an Army sergeant walked into a combat stress center and opened fire , killing five of his fellow soldiers .
Ten members of a single military unit at Fort Carson , Colorado , were charged with murder , attempted murder , or manslaughter from 2006 through the fall of 2008 .
An article in the September 2009 issue of Management Science notes that the tempo of deployment cycles in Iraq is higher than for any war since World War II and that survey data suggests that the rate of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder among Iraq war veterans may be as high as 35 percent .
Endless war is wreaking havoc on American society .
The Fort Hood shootings emerge almost inevitably out of this horror and confusion .

The sex scandal that engulfed Tiger Woods may have cost shareholders of companies endorsed by the world ’s No. 1 golfer up to $ 12 billion in losses , according to a study by two economics professors from the University of California , Davis .

The study , released on Monday by researchers Victor Stango and Christopher Knittel , gave an estimate for damage to the market value of Woods ’ main sponsors caused by revelations of alleged extramarital affairs that surfaced after he was involved in a minor car accident outside his Florida home on November 27 .
“ We estimate that shareholders of Tiger Woods ’ sponsors lost $ 5 - 12 billion after his car accident , relative to shareholders of firms that Mr. Woods does not endorse , ” the researchers wrote , adding that millions of shareholders were affected .
“ Our analysis makes clear that while having a celebrity of Tiger Woods ’ stature as an endorser has undeniable upside , the downside risk is substantial , too , ” Stango , a professor at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management , said in a statement released along with the study .
Woods , believed to be the world ’s wealthiest athlete who was estimated to earn about $ 100 million a year in endorsement deals before his troubles , confessed on December 11 to “ infidelity ” to his Swedish wife Elin Nordegren .
He announced he would take an indefinite break from golf to save his marriage .
Some of the star golfer ’s main commercial sponsors have backed away from him as a result of the scandal .
Others , while standing by him , have said they are evaluating their future relationship .
STOCK MARKET RETURNS
In their study , the two professors said they looked at stock market returns for the 13 trading days after November 27 , the date of the car incident that ignited the Woods scandal .
They compared returns for Woods ’ sponsors during this period to those of both the total stock market and of each sponsor ’s closest competitor .
They also reviewed returns for four years before the car accident to build up a comparative picture of the sponsors ’ market performance .
The study looked at sponsors of Tiger Woods for which stock prices were available , in several cases through quoted prices for the parent companies .
Sponsors included : Accenture ; AT&T ; Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf ( Electronic Arts ) ; Gillette ( Proctor and Gamble ) ; Nike ; Gatorade ( PepsiCo ) ; TLC Laser Eye Centers .
The report carried a caution that this kind of statistical study might have a “ particularly large ” margin of error because many sponsors were subsidiaries of larger quoted companies .
Overall , Knittel and Stango concluded that the scandal reduced shareholder value in the sponsor companies by 2.3 percent , or about $ 12 billion .
They called the results statistically significant and said the overall pattern of losses at the parent companies was unlikely to stem from ordinary day - to - day variation in their stock prices . ”
“ Our findings speak to a larger question of general interest in the business and academic communities :
Does celebrity sponsorship have any impact on a firm ’s bottom line ? ” Stango and Knittel said in presenting the report .
The scandal saw a parade of more than a dozen women -- from cocktail waitresses to porn stars -- come forward to say they had affairs with the married father of two .
Since the start of the scandal , Woods has kept out of sight of the media .

Military agency studying space garbage service

SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : December 12 , 2009
The Pentagon 's research and development division is studying concepts to remove dangerous space debris from orbit , an endeavor long dismissed as too costly but potentially feasible with technology advancements .

The study is called Catcher 's Mitt and will explore technically and economically feasible ways to rid Earth orbit of space junk that threatens active space missions , including the International Space Station and valuable satellites .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the Department of Defense 's technology development arm , is leading the Catcher 's Mitt study .
The analysis was the subject of a conference sponsored by DARPA and NASA this week in Washington .
Nearly 300 participants and approximately 60 speakers attended the event .
Representatives from NASA , the European Space Agency , Russia , Japan and industry were at the first - of - a- kind conference , according to DARPA .
Presenters discussed exotic concepts including lasers , tethers , solar sails and methods of capturing debris to move objects out of often - used orbits .
Some of these techniques , if practical , promise to be less costly than older concepts .
Removing space debris from orbit is not a new idea .
There have been evaluations of techniques for such an effort since the 1970s , but they have all fallen flat because of insurmountable technical and cost hurdles .
Any debris removal system will also have to contend with legal and policy issues .
Nations and companies can retain ownership of hardware in orbit after it is retired , so an international agreement or legislation may be required .
" Cost is often the principal factor impeding orbital debris removal concepts , " said Nicholas Johnson .
" Several concepts appear to be technically feasible , but the expense of removing a single large object or numerous small ones has not yet proven cost - effective .
However , technology advances and perhaps future reductions in space transportation costs could alter this situation . "
Despite the expense and challenges , experts believe the only way to solve the space debris problem is to remove objects from orbit .
" NASA studies have shown that the current Earth satellite population is unstable and will lead to the creation of new debris via accidental collisions at a rate faster than the debris will be removed by natural forces , " Johnson said .
" The only means of curtailing this debris growth is to remove existing resident space objects , preferably the larger and more massive ones in highly congestion regions first . "
International space agencies have agreed to guidelines to improve the space debris environment .
The guidelines aim to reduce the odds of orbital collisions , limit debris release events , minimize the potential for on - orbit breakups , and set standards for disposal of old rockets and satellites .

But the population of space debris is predicted to grow at faster rates in the future .
Two significant events fundamentally changed the debris environment in the last three years , creater an even greater sense of urgency .
In January 2007 , China tested an anti-satellite weapon and destroyed a weather satellite , creating a cloud of debris comprising nearly 3,000 objects .
An accidental collision between a Russian military satellite and a commercial communications spacecraft in February added nearly 2,000 more objects to the crowded low - altitude orbital catalog .
Roughly 15,000 objects larger than 4 inches circle Earth , and about 95 percent of those are fragements or unusable satellites and rocket stages .
Hundreds of thousands more pieces of debris , smaller than the palm of a hand , also pose a serious threat to operational missions , but military radars can't track those objects .
Scientists predict a cascading number of orbital collisions in the coming years , as more objects are launched and liberated during impacts .
The likelihood of a debris collision with an individual spacecraft is relatively low , but the consequences are catastrophic and the odds will only increase in the coming decades , according to analysts .
" Current analysis indicates collisions between orbital objects could potentially lead to a sustained growth in the debris population .
Debris mitigation alone will not be sufficient to prevent a continual increase in the number of debris objects , " says a DARPA fact sheet on the Catcher 's Mitt study .
Johnson said he expects about one accidental collision every five years for the next few decades , each producing more debris .
" Later in this century the collision rate will increase , " Johnson said .
" Therefore , the sooner an effective debris removal technique can be employed , the better . "
DARPA is collecting information for the study from this week 's conference , independent utility analyses by the military and NASA , and a formal request for information released to industry in September .
" DARPA intends to use the results of these three approaches to determine whether DARPA investment in a new program is warranted and where and how to be most effective .
If justified , potential follow - on efforts might include a new DARPA led program , or DARPA support for an effort led by another U.S. government organization , " said Wade Pulliam , a program manager with the DARPA Tactical Technology Office .

LATELY more people have begun to express an interest in where the meat they eat comes from and how it was raised .
Were the animals humanely treated ?
Did they have a good quality of life before the death that turned them into someone ’s dinner ?
Some of these questions , which reach a fever pitch in the days leading up to Thanksgiving , pertain to the ways in which animals are treated .
( Did your turkey get to live outdoors ? )
Others focus on the question of how eating the animals in question will affect the consumer ’s health and well - being .
( Was it given hormones and antibiotics ? )
None of these questions , however , make any consideration of whether it is wrong to kill animals for human consumption .
And even when people ask this question , they almost always find a variety of resourceful answers that purport to justify the killing and consumption of animals in the name of human welfare .
Strict ethical vegans , of which I am one , are customarily excoriated for equating our society ’s treatment of animals with mass murder .
Can anyone seriously consider animal suffering even remotely comparable to human suffering ?
Those who answer with a resounding no typically argue in one of two ways .
Some suggest that human beings but not animals are made in God ’s image and hence stand in much closer proximity to the divine than any non-human animal ; according to this line of thought , animals were made expressly for the sake of humans and may be used without scruple to satisfy their needs and desires .
There is ample support in the Bible and in the writings of Christian thinkers like Augustine and Thomas Aquinas for this pointedly anthropocentric way of devaluing animals .

OTTAWA  Given their dependence on the device , it is no surprise that many BlackBerry owners are quick to complain when their smartphone fails to deliver on its promise of offering e-mail anywhere , at any time .
But will a major disruption of BlackBerry e-mail and Internet service from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning  the second failure in a less than a week  prompt any of them to make the switch to another smartphone , threatening the BlackBerry ’s market - leading position ?
The shutdown , which affected users in North and South America , appears to have started about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday .
Service was generally restored by 2:45 a.m. Wednesday .
BlackBerry users turned to another communication platform , Twitter , to express outrage over the latest interruption .
“ Never Again BlackBerry , ” one user post read .
Like other shutdowns in the past , including a major disruption 18 months ago , this week ’s failure appeared to be an unintended consequence of a software upgrade .
But Research
In Motion , the company in Ontario that makes the BlackBerry , again provided relatively little information to users , wireless carriers and the news media .
BRITNEY Spears ' Melbourne concerts look set to be derailed as fans flock to offload tickets to her shows .
Hundreds of tickets to her Rod Laver Arena shows were listed on eBay this week .
The sell - off by fans follows a lip - synch controversy that has dogged the star since she arrived in Australia just a week ago .
Dozens more went on sale on Thursday after the pop princess failed to wow fans with her first Melbourne show on Wednesday night .
Some have been listed with a starting price of just 99 c - with no reserve .
At Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday , fans walked out early in disgust at a lacklustre performance with some demanding their money back .
Other disillusioned fans were offering to give away premium tickets outside the venue .
With tickets ranging between $ 200 and $ 1500 they were promised " a dazzling display of music , dance , magic and theatrics " at the year 's " biggest spectacle " .
Instead they said they felt ripped off .
Spears came under fire for sloppy dance routines .
" If you 're going to mime , at least learn how to dance , " one disappointed fan said .
" It was the worst $ 200 I 've ever spent . "
Independent ticket broker Shaun Black said the Circus tour was a flop .
" It has been really tough .
I will lose a lot of money with this tour , " Mr Black said .
' But it 's not just my tickets that are n't selling , people are just deciding they do n't want to go , " he said .
" The market has been flooded with people wanting to offload their tickets and now there 's just too much supply .
" There were more than 300 tickets listed for Britney on eBay the other day - I have never seen anything like it .
" But no one wants to go . "
Spears , who regularly keeps her fans updated through social networking site Twitter , made no comment about the show .
But her manager Adam Leber told fans : " Britney rocked it in Melbourne last night ! "
He said despite the lip - synch controversy , she had received rave reviews .
Spears performs at Rod Laver Arena tonight before heading to Sydney for the next leg of her tour and will return to Melbourne on November 27 for a final show .
It is believed sales for Spears ' Brisbane leg of the tour have been so poor some tickets have been slashed to just $ 50 .

Wanxiang - Tiancheng shopping centre in China has built a women only car park .
The car park has the following features –
Wang Zheng , the manager of the facility , said that the design would appeal to women ’s “ strong sense of colour and different sense of distance ” .
He said : “ There is a scientific basis for all this .
Women have a poorer sense of distance when they are locked inside a small space .
That is why female drivers often bump the front and back of their cars .
There is also a 15 per cent greater chance that a woman will whack her car door into another car when she opens it . ”
One female driver interviewed by the Hebei Youth Daily newspaper said she appreciated the gesture .
The driver , who was named only as Miss Zhang , said : “ Female drivers just are not as good as male drivers , technically .
The added space helps us to park safely .
I think it shows respect for women .
I hope that other facilities will take women ’s needs into consideration . ”

Obama : We Can't Treat Tax Dollars Like " Monopoly Money "
" In the long run we can't continue to spend as if deficits do n't have consequences , as if waste does n't matter , as if the hard earned tax dollars of the American people can be treated like monopoly money , that 's what we 've seen time and time again , Washington has become more concerned about the next election than the next generation .

The Christian Science Monitor has a neat little piece on America ’s burgeoning shadow economy :
Perhaps the biggest surprise about America ’s shadow economy is its size .
Long associated with colorful street hawkers in the developing world , the shadow economy makes up a larger portion of the economies of countries like Greece ( 25 percent ) or Mozambique ( more than 40 percent ) than it does in the US .
But because America ’s economy is so much bigger , its shadow economy amounts to nearly 8 percent of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) — in the ballpark of $ 1 trillion , estimates Friedrich Schneider , an economics professor at Johannes Kepler University in Linz , Austria .
That ’s bigger than the GDP of Turkey or Australia .
Many nations would n’t survive if not for their gray and black markets .
Some of Europe is more heavily regulated than America , but with large segments of the economy operating outside the radar of the regulatory and tax police .
Of course , many of the Soviet Union ’s subjects only survived thanks to illegal economic activity .
This expanding black market in America demonstrates something important :
The capacity of the market to exist without the state .
Indeed , we libertarians who believe that a free society could thrive without a monopoly on violence ( i.e. , a state ) , should look upon the growing black market as overall a positive thing , and a model , for the most part , of civilized behavior .
In a free market society , there would be no black market as such , at least not in anything that would be legitimate ( there might still be small amounts of exchange in the realm of properly illegal activity , such as the hiring of hitmen ) .
In a free society , contracts could be upheld for a large range of activity where there is no government protection , such as the street drug trade .
But consider : Most of the illegal drug trade works and thrives .
People get what they want out of it .
Most illegal drug transactions are upheld and carried out honestly , with most economic actors walking away from the transactions satisfied .
This all happens not just in the absence of government protection of contracts , but in the face of outright government hostility , prohibitions , policing , and threats of jail time .
If a market can operate without the government protecting it , and indeed while the state is attempting at great cost to obstruct it , then we can safely argue that it would probably operate fine , and even better , without the state being involved at all .
Not only would taking the state out of the picture allow for the now - illegal market to flourish without the cost of avoiding state sanction ; getting rid of the state would allow for the advent of more market mechanisms , such as arbitration , openly publicized customer reviews leading to sophisticated public calculation of a business ’s reputation , and contract enforcement .
That one trillion dollars is moving around in the economy in direct confrontation with state intervention shows that the market is self - organizing .
We do not need the state to oversee all this business — in fact , despite the state ’s obstructive presence , the underground market thrives .
Are there problems ?
Of course .
There is fraud , which would be harder to get away with if this market were all out in the open , and not forced into the shadows by the state .
There is misrepresentation and dishonesty .
But these are the exceptions .
And can we really believe there is less of this in the legal , regulated economy ?
It seems to me , the more involved the state is in overseeing the economic sector — banking , military spending , education , health care — the more we see corruption , waste and fraud .
This is because the state itself represents the legitimization of violent and predatory behavior , and the more it expands its role in overseeing and attempting to direct the economy , the more illegitimate and dishonest behavior gets the state ’s official seal of approval and protection through the force of law .
The state allows corrupt business practices to operate under the facade of legitimacy .
The black market , on the other hand , must exist with efficiency and mostly with honesty , so as to overcome the cost of avoiding government obstacles and detection .
Indeed , I would guess we are less likely to see speculative bubbles and systemic fraud in the illegal market than in huge swaths of the more highly regulated and politicized sector .
But the remaining problems with the black market , such as with the turf wars and adulterated products in the drug market , would mostly disappear if the state just withered away , as almost all these problems could be traced to the effect of police intervention and the need of illicit entrepreneurs and customers to circumvent the state ’s watchful eye .
But most of the black market is much more peaceful than the drug market , since it is just taxes and regulations , rather than iron clad punitive drug laws , that are being avoided .
Competition , reputation and arbitration would allow for a more honest market than we see today either below ground or above the board .
CRITICS WHO blame the Government for the economic crisis should “ dig the garden or grow bluebells or do something useful ” , former taoiseach Bertie Ahern has said .
In an interview , Mr Ahern attacked “ cynics and knockers , people who always see the glass as half empty .
I ca n’t understand people who are always bitching , saying ‘ It ’s the Government ’s fault , it ’s the doctor ’s fault , it ’s the cat ’s fault . ’
It ’s everybody ’s fault except their own .
“ I do n’t know why they would n’t go out and dig the garden or grow bluebells or do something useful !
I like doers – people who paint their house , bake , work , whatever , ” he told the latest edition of VIPmagazine .
He said that since he resigned as taoiseach last year , “ life is not as controlled as it was .
I ’m busy doing different things , some quite important , but it ’s just not the same .
If I want to go to a match , I go to a match ; if I want to see some friends tomorrow night , I can do that , so it ’s a big change . ”
Asked whether he was happier now , he said : “ Yes , definitely , but there are times I miss it . ”
Commenting on the economic difficulties facing his successor , he said : “ Brian has had it rough because of the huge international slowdown .
The big trick for him is how we can get out of it quickly . ”
In another interview , which is to be broadcast on TV3 this week and which was reported in yesterday ’s Sunday Times , Mr Ahern says an unnamed political colleague had worked “ night and day ” to bring him down .
“ One person working night and day to screw me up and I think I know why and I think I know how .
Maybe , along the way , they got things wrong , and maybe they had to be punished a bit for that , and maybe they set about then trying to screw up .
“ I know who the person is .
But libel laws are dangerous and if you ca n’t prove it , you ca n’t say it .
But you can still know it , ” the former taoiseach says .
Bertie Ahern also told the Sunday Timesa colleague had worked “ night and day ” to bring him down
homeopathic physics abuse , take two
It really seems homeopaths do n't understand basic middle school physics and are hoping you do n't either in the asinine pitches for their snake oil .
After reviewing the horrifying evils unleashed on unsuspecting physics equations by Dr. Charlene Werner and explaining just how wrong she really was , I thought that her video would go unrivaled as an example of wild , clinical inanity for a long , long time .
And as odd as it may seem , I was wrong .
Cancer surgeon and glutton for punishment , Orac , has found a certain Dr. John Benneth who boldly tries to jump the bar set by our airheaded homeopathic optometrist and comes disturbingly close .
Yes ladies and germs , we have another desecration of physics on our hands and believe it or not , if homeopathy really worked the way he explains , it would be an extreme weapon that would rival nuclear warheads and weaponized pathogens in any military arsenal …
As anyone who ’s familiar with homeopath ’s explanations of how their cures are supposed to work can guess at this point , Benneth ’s speech is all about energy and how this energy reacts with the cells and molecules in the client ’s body .
The disturbing thing is where he claims this energy comes from and how it works …
The dilution and succussion process that is used to make homeopathic medicines creates self - replicating hydrate clathrates .
These are crystalloid polymers that appear as nanobubbles that are emitting electromagnetic radiation transformed from the natural background radiation .
The cells of the body pick this up and react to it .
Why oh why do woo- meisters love to use words like energy and radiation while blissfully oblivious to what the words mean or how the physics behind them actually work ?
Let ’s think about this for a moment .
Energy , if we go by the strict physical definition , is the ability of a system to perform work .
That ’s it .
If you direct energy into a body , you ’ll be knocking around molecules .
And if you ’re an organism , that ’s a really bad thing because all the particles and ionizing electromagnetic rays will eventually start hitting something important .
Like your genome for instance .
When exposed to high levels of radiation , living tissues decay and die .
So when you ’re drinking a radioactive remedy that works by bombarding your cells with energy , you ’re effectively drinking poison .
Why do you think beams of radiation are used in oncology ?
They bombard cancer cells and kill off tumors .
The irony of an alt med practitioner ranting against the destructive power of modern medicine while promoting radiation as the key to homeopathic remedies would be hilarious if we knew people did n’t fall for it .
Oh and there ’s more .
The background radiation we experience in everyday life is heat , light and a steady buzz of microwaves from communication satellites , cellular towers and power lines .
And all of these phenomena take the form of waves propagating through space , or electromagnetic radiation .
So how exactly does shaking up water with a few drops of some mysterious substance transform electromagnetic radiation into more of the same ?
Could it be that ( gasp ! ) Dr. Benneth has no idea what he ’s talking about and that since all releasing a propagating wave of energy in water would do is heat it up , he ’s really telling you that if you just warm up water , you ’ve effectively made a viable homeopathic cure right at home ?
No , of course not , the woo faithful will cry in his defense .
That ’s not the “ right form of energy ” and it would never work .
But since energy is just the ability for work to be done in a system , energy only comes in different levels and vehicles .
Under the hood , it ’s the same effect working its way through stars , planets and living things via different mechanisms .
As most other skeptics who tackle homeopathy , I ’m asked all the time why I ca n’t just ignore this fluffy woo and let it coexist with modern medicine .
What ’s the harm in having people do what makes them feel good as long as they ’re not hurting themselves or others ?
For all those who ask , I want to point to Charlene Werner and the other homeopaths who trip over their own tongues when they try to explain what they actually do and make so many gross mistakes , they would fail eight grade science in a heartbeat .
Would you trust a doctor who ’s totally lost when you ask about the heart ’s basic functions ?
Or one who thinks that your spleen is somewhere below your kidneys , sandwiched between your reproductive system and the large intestine ?
Why would you possibly trust someone who clearly has no clue how their remedies are supposed to work and why would you choose them over people who actually know enough about anatomy and biology to explain how they ’d rather treat you and why they want to do it that way ?
THE SAFEST airline in the world , it is widely agreed , is El Al , Israel 's national carrier .

No El Al plane has been attacked by terrorists in more than three decades , and no flight leaving Ben Gurion has ever been hijacked .

According to a just - completed study by the New America Foundation , quoted in Mayer ’s piece , Obama has authorized as many drone strikes in Pakistan in nine and a half months as George W. Bush did in his last three years in office — at least 41 C.I.A. missile strikes , or about one a week , that may have killed more than 500 people .
The dead have included high - value targets like Osama bin Laden ’s oldest son and Baitullah Mehsud , the Taliban leader in Pakistan — as well as bystanders .
Circling drones have struck panic .
But as Mayer notes , “ The embrace of the Predator program has occurred with remarkably little public discussion , given that it represents a radically new and geographically unbounded use of state - sanctioned lethal force . ”
These are targeted international killings , no less real , and indeed more insidious , for their video - game aspect .
The thing about robotic warfare is you can watch people get vaporized on a screen in Langley , Virginia , and then drive home for dinner with the kids .
The very phrase “ go to war ” becomes hard to distinguish from going to work .
That ’s a conflation fraught with ethical danger .
The barriers to war get lowered .
P.W. Singer , the author of an important new book called “ Wired for War , ” told me that , “ We are at a breakpoint in history .
The U.S. Air Force this year will train more unmanned system pilots than fighter and bomber pilots combined .
And , as Bill Gates has noted , robotics are now where computers were back in 1980 . ”
Now you might think that a “ pilot ” sitting behind a computer bank in Nevada blowing away people in Afghanistan is less liable to combat stress than a soldier in a unit deployed there , but Singer said the opposite has often proved the case
It ’s time for a reckoning , especially from a president who campaigned so vigorously against the “ dark side ” of the war on terror .
Congressional review of the drone programs and the full implications of robotic warfare is essential to cast light and lay ground rules .
The Obama administration should not be targeting people for killing without some public debate about how such targets are selected , what the grounds are in the laws of war , and what agencies are involved .
Right now there ’s an accountability void .
There are also broader questions .
When robots are tomorrow ’s veterans , does war become more likely and more endless ?
Do drones cow enemies with America ’s technological prowess or embolden them to think America is not man enough to fight ?
What is the psychological toll on video - screen warriors ?
There ’s nothing innocent after all about the fluttering of a fruit fly ’s wing .

Gmail colpita dagli hacker
Rubate 500 password
Attacco anche a Hotmail , Yahoo e Aol .
Un portavoce di Google : " Cambiate le chiavi di accesso "
ROMA - Massiccio attacco agli indirizzi di posta elettronica di Gmail , la e-mail di Google , per rubare password e nomi utenti di decine di migliaia di utenti : è l'ultimo allarme per la sicurezza online , ammesso oggi alla Bbc dal grande motore di ricerca di Mountain View , California .
L'emittente inglese aveva parlato in un primo tempo di trentamila utenti colpiti .
" Ci siamo accorti di recente di uno schema di phishing con il quale gli hackers ottenevano credenziali di accesso per indirizzi e-mail e abbonamenti , inclusi quelli di Gmail " , ha detto un portavoce di Google alla tv britannica .
" Raccomanderei di cambiare la password su ogni sito sul quale fosse usata " , ha suggerito un consulente di sicurezza , Graham Cluley .
E' dimostrato infatti , che circa il 40 per cento delle persone usano la stessa password su tutti gli account elettronici ( mail , banca , aerei , treni , ecc. )
Gli account attaccati sono 500 , di cui diecimila di hotmail .
Nelle liste in possesso della società , figurano anche indirizzi di Yahoo , Aol , Comcast ed Earthlink , ma sono in gran parte vecchi : quelli tuttora attivi riguarderebbero soprattutto Hotmail e Gmail .

A Graceful Arc
Credit & Copyright : Tony Hallas
Explanation :
The graceful arc of the Milky Way begins and ends at two mountain peaks in this solemn night sky panorama .
The view was created from a 24 frame mosaic , with exposures tracking Earth and sky separately .
In the final composition , northern California 's Mount Lassen was positioned at the left and Mount Shasta at the far right , just below the star and dust clouds of the galactic center .
Lassen and Shasta are volcanoes in the Cascade Mountain Range of North America , an arc of the volcanic Pacific Ring of Fire .
In the dim , snow - capped peaks , planet Earth seems to echo the subtle glow of the Milky Way 's own faint , unresolved starlight .
Designer water connoisseurs can try a new tipple , directly sourced from the military zone between the two Koreas .
The water is called DMZ 2 km and is bottled near the buffer zone separating North and South Korea .
It comes from an area unspoilt for decades , enclosed by razor wire fences , filled with land mines and monitored by more than one million armed soldiers .
The zone is a wildlife haven but also boasts one of the world 's largest concentrations of weapons .
In spite of its name , the Korean demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) is the world 's most heavily armed frontier .
It is a 4 km ( 2.5 - mile ) thick ribbon that has divided the Korean peninsula since the end of the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
The two Koreas are still technically at war .
But the makers of the drink hope it will appeal to those who do not think of the area in geo-political terms .
" We decided on water from the DMZ because it 's different , and the environment there is untouched , so many people thinks it 's clean , " brand spokesman Lee Sang - hyo says .
The bottler draws the water from a plant close to the South Korean end of the DMZ , from a spring that flows directly under it .
" Getting the water is not dangerous at all .
We worked it all out with the military , " Mr Lee added .

RAICHUR : You ca n’t google in Google .
In what must surely the most delicious irony of modern times , the tiny village of Google , about 510 km north - east of Bangalore , does n’t have internet connectivity .
This village on the banks of the river Krishna with 1,000 residents in Raichur district is far removed from the search engine company based in Mountain View , California .
How you spell the name is left to you as there are no English boards anywhere .
All the boards , including those of government offices , are in Kannada .
And , on all of them , the name sounds exactly like how Google is pronounced .
When the government tried to put up English boards , activists stopped them .
“ We asked officials what was the purpose of putting up boards in English .
Would anyone from Cambridge University come here to read these boards ” asks teacher and Kannada activist K P Yallayyanayaka .
“ My grand - daughter told me that two boys have named a website after our village .
I feel happy and proud , ” says octogenarian landlord Basavarajappa Gouda Police Patil .
The aftermath of the attempted bombing has been marked by an increasingly fierce partisan exchange over culpability heading into a midterm election year .
With Republicans on the attack against the administration as not taking terrorism seriously enough , Democrats returned fire by accusing the opposition of standing in the way of needed personnel and money while exploiting public fears .
The debate has escalated since Mr. Obama ’s secretary of homeland security , Janet Napolitano , said Sunday that “ the system worked ” after officials said the suspect tried to ignite explosive chemicals aboard a Northwest Airlines flight approaching Detroit .
Ms. Napolitano made clear the next day that she had meant the system worked in its response to the attempted bombing , not before it happened .
Mr. Obama appeared to be trying to contain the damage on Tuesday , offering “ systemic failure ” as a substitute diagnosis for “ system worked . ”
He framed Ms. Napolitano ’s statement by saying she was right that “ once the suspect attempted to take down Flight 253 , after his attempt , it ’s clear that passengers and crew , our homeland security systems and our aviation security took all appropriate actions . ”
The president praised the professionalism of the nation ’s intelligence , counterterrorism , homeland security and law enforcement officials .
But he spared little in his sharp judgment about how a known extremist could be allowed to board a flight bound for the United States after his own father had warned that he had become radical .
“ There was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , ” Mr. Obama told reporters at the Marine Corps base at Kaneohe Bay outside Honolulu , near his vacation home in Kailua .
“ We need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . ”
Mr. Obama suggested that he would overhaul the watch - list system .
“ We ’ve achieved much since 9/11 in terms of collecting information that relates to terrorists and potential terrorist attacks , ” he said .
“ But it ’s becoming clear that the system that has been in place for years now is not sufficiently up to date to take full advantage of the information we collect and the knowledge we have . ”
Mr. Abdulmutallab , who has been linked to the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda , came to the attention of the American authorities when his father went to the American Embassy in Nigeria last month to report that his son had expressed radical views before disappearing .
The father , a respected retired banker , did not say his son planned to attack Americans but sought help locating him and bringing him home , United States officials said .
Police laid a trap and arrested Mr Verma A man in the Indian capital , Delhi , faked his own kidnapping to fund a holiday with his girlfriend in Macau , police said .
Pawan Verma , 22 , demanded a ransom of nearly $ 43,000 from his businessman father .
Mr Verma had a taste for high - life and had run up a debt of $ 18,000 .
He was arrested when he went to pick up the money from a mall .
Police said that Mr Verma 's father , who owns two shops , would decide if he wanted to press charges .
Ransom call " Pawan 's girlfriend demanded he take her to Macau on New Year 's eve .
He hatched a plan to fake his own abduction with the help of a friend , Himanshu Kumar , " the Hindustan Times newspaper quoted deputy commissioner of police Jaspal Singh as saying .
" Due to his limited earnings , he had accumulated a huge debt but he wanted to fulfil his girlfriend 's wish .
Mr Verma is believed to have wanted a taste of the high life On Saturday , Mr Verma 's father , Ram Sahay Verma , complained to the police that his younger son had been abducted and that he had received a ransom call .
The police laid a trap and arrested Mr Verma when he turned up to collect his own ransom , police said .
" The [ ransom ] calls and SMS [ text messages ] were being made from Verma 's mobile .
Verma 's elder brother Punit accompanied us to deliver the ransom .
Six hours later a man in black jacket came to pick up the bag , " Mr Singh said .
" Punit was shocked to find it was his own brother . "
Police said Verma 's father would have to decide if he wanted to pursue a criminal case against his son .
" If the father , who is a complainant in the case , decides to withdraw the complaint , the son can walk free with the orders of the court , " a police officer said .

All the talk has been of the tiny island nation of Tuvalu , most famous until this week for the .tv top level domain so favoured by TV stations across the globe .
It has a population of just over 12,000 ( in other words , two ten thousandths of one percent of the global population ) .
But because it is less than 4.5 m above sea level , somehow it has become the poster child for climate change , because “ rising sea levels caused by global warming ” will flood the islands sooner than anywhere else .
Ironic , then , that sea levels have been rising at about 3 mm per year since the end of the last Ice Age , with no perceptible acceleration due to “ global warming ” – in fact possibly a slight slowing :
So at current rates , it will take about 1,500 years for the sea to rise 4.5 metres , so hardly a climate emergency that requires urgent action today at Copenhagen rather than in 100 or 200 or even 500 years time , when the costs of adaptation will be far less .
And furthermore , the islands are all coral atolls and reefs , notoriously unstable and most of which are known to be sinking into the sea anyway – that kind of sounds like a problem for them to deal with , rather than blackmailing the rest of the world .
Warning :
If you hate having a logic puzzle you can't solve , you should stop reading now .
The problem with most logic puzzles is that they are inelegant .
They either rely on difficult mathematical concepts , long induction chains , phrasings based on puns / cultural assumptions , or totally anti-climatic " lateral thinking " surprises .
And of the few elegant logic puzzles left , many are too well - known ( i.e. , the 3 light - bulbs problem ) .
I think an elegant logic puzzle is one that can be told to anyone age 10 and up and does n't rely on gimmicks , but always seems impossible to anyone when first told .
In other words , the problem is tough but the solution is satisfactorily simple once explained .
The solution does n't involve a person or tool that was n't explicitly stated in the problem itself .
What follows are two logic puzzles I 've found that I think are elegant but which are relatively unknown .
To increase the challenge , I will not post the solutions here ( nor will I tell you even if you email me ) .
Furthermore , I have altered the phrasings and context such that similar versions of the puzzles can't be easily googled .
Amulet Transfer Galendor and Kellen are two spies working for the same underground organization .
Galendor has recently stolen a rare artifact - The Mithril Amulet - from the Queen of Rengefall .
Galendor must pass the artifact to Kellen to be transported out of Rengefall but the Queen 's henchmen are closing in on them .
Galendor and Kellen are staying in two different rooms in a tavern at the border of Rengefall .
Because of the henchmen , neither of them can leave the room tonight for fear of being caught .
Thus , the only way that Galendor and Kellen can transfer objects between each other is via the tavern servants .
The problem is that all the servants in the tavern are known to be thieves and will steal anything that is not secure .
Both Galendor and Kellen have an iron safe with a large clasp that can be secured with a padlock .
Both of them have a padlock and its corresponding key .
In other words , there is 1 Amulet , 2 Safes , 2 Padlocks , and 2 correponding Keys .
Anything that is not padlocked in a safe will be stolen by the servants .
This includes any unlocked padlocks , keys , and of course the Amulet itself .
Given these constraints , how did Galendor manage to transfer the Amulet to Kellen ?
One Hundred Copper Coins
In Rengefall , copper coins are minted with the portrait of the Queen on one side and the portrait of the King on the other side .
On this day , the half - crazed executioner gives the captured Talin one chance to avoid execution .
The executioner brings Talin into an unlit room .
He tells Talin that scattered on the table in front of him are one hundred copper coins of which twenty have the Queen side facing up while the rest have the King side facing up .
If Talin can separate the coins into two piles , each with the same number of Queens facing up , he will release Talin .
One other constraint is that Talin must accomplish this task in 5 minutes .
If Talin fails , he will be beheaded .
It is impossible for Talin to see which side the coins are facing up in the darkness , and the contours of the portraits are too similar to decipher by touch .
Nevertheless , Talin managed to separate the coins into two piles with the same number of Queens facing up in the time allotted .
How did he accomplish this ?
( The correct answer does not involve standing coins on their edges .
Elegant logic puzzles do not involve semantic loopholes . )

Copenhagen Climate Conference Collapses
Ronald Bailey 's fifth and final dispatch from the Copenhagen climate conference
World leaders are abandoning the Bella Center like rats off a sinking ship after declaring that a deal has been reached at the Copenhagen climate change conference .
Two years ago at the Bali climate conference , it was agreed that the signatories to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol would finalize a binding global treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the Copenhagen meeting .
That goal was put aside even before the meeting here got started .
In turn , the Copenhagen conference was supposed to resolve major issues like the mid-term reduction commitments by developed countries , how to monitor those commitments , and how to fund adaptation and mitigation in poor countries .
Now those goals have been put off to the indefinite future .
Although the detailed language is not yet available , the broad outlines are apparently these :
(1) The agreement sets a target of no more than two degrees Celsius for the increase in global temperatures .
(2) The agreement sets the goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050 with the developed countries cutting their emissions by 80 percent .
(3) Going into the Copenhagen conference , the goal was to adopt a binding treaty by next meeting in Mexico City in 2010 .
That goal has been dropped and no date set for a future deal .
(4) With regard to transparency — the big sticking point between China and the U.S. — countries are supposed to provide information tracking their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions , but the guidelines for monitoring those activities are to be negotiated later .
Ignore the spin that the politicians try to put on it :
In any meaningful sense , the Copenhagen climate conference collapsed .

Cannabis is an illegal drug in most countries People who smoke potent skunk are more at risk of psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia than those who use other types of cannabis , scientists suspect .
According to new research , regular users double their risk of psychosis but heavy skunk users increase theirs seven - fold .
UK experts have a theory it is down to skunk 's composition - it contains more of the chemical that gets users stoned .
The work is published in British Journal of Psychiatry .
The findings come only weeks after the UK's chief drugs adviser was sacked after he criticised the government 's decision to reclassify cannabis up to Class B from C. Public education about the risks of heavy use of high - potency cannabis is vital
Researcher Dr Di Forti
The authors of the latest research from the Institute of Psychiatry were quick to stress that their work is merely to inform .
And they point out that drug use only accounts for the minority of cases of psychotic illnesses - somewhere between 10 % and 15 % .
Other risk factors , such as family history of mental health problems , play a far bigger part .
But they say cannabis , and particularly stronger skunk , should be considered a potential health hazard in a similar way to alcohol .
Lifestyle choices
Just as downing a bottle of whisky a day is riskier than drinking half a glass of wine each evening with your dinner , smoking strong skunk every day poses a greater threat than smoking less potent types of cannabis every now and then , they say .
When Dr Marta Di Forti and colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry screened 280 patients admitted to their hospital with psychotic symptoms for the first time , they found most - nearly 80 % - were heavy skunk users .
You never truly know what you 're getting and stronger cannabis , such as skunk , can increase the chance of suffering a nasty reaction
Chris Hudson , addictions expert at the charity Frank
They also questioned healthy controls of a similar age and social background , who they recruited through newspaper ads and the internet , about their personal drug use .
They found no real difference between the two groups in whether they had ever used cannabis or their age at first use .
But the patients with psychosis were twice as likely to have used cannabis for longer than five years , and over six times more likely to use it every day .
Moreover , among those who had used cannabis , patients with psychosis were seven times more likely to use skunk than controls .
The experts believe skunk is particularly damaging because it contains more THC .
Potency
This is the main psychoactive ingredient and has been shown to produce psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions in experiments .
Unlike skunk , hashish - cannabis resin - contains substantial quantities of another chemical called cannabidiol or CBD and research suggests this can act as an antidote to the THC , counteracting its psychotic side effects .
Dr Di Forte said their findings were concerning , particularly as skunk has come to dominate the UK cannabis market in recent years .
" Public education about the risks of heavy use of high - potency cannabis is vital . "
She said more far work was needed to assess the exact risks of smoking different types and quantities of cannabis .
Experts do know that the risks go up with both duration and amount of use .
Zero tolerance A spokesman from The Legalise Cannabis Alliance UK said : " We do n't need to worry about the health harms of people smoking cannabis per se , whether it is skunk or not .
" What is a concern is that as a result of prohibition some dealers put other stuff into the cannabis they sell that may be damaging .
I 've heard of lead and glass being put in it . "
Chris Hudson , addictions expert at the charity Frank , said : " You never truly know what you 're getting and stronger cannabis , such as skunk , can increase the chance of suffering a nasty reaction . "
A Home Office spokesman said : " The reclassification of cannabis as a Class B drug was partly in response to emerging concerns about the growing use of stronger strains of cannabis , such as skunk , and the harm they may cause to users ' mental health .
" We remain determined to crack down on all illegal substances and minimise their harm to health and society as a whole . "
Marjorie Wallace of the mental health charity SANE said : " We receives daily evidence that the long - term use of skunk , with its specific chemical make - up , can trigger frightening psychotic episodes , cause relapse and may bring about mental conditions such as schizophrenia .
" It can also rob developing young minds of their potential and wreck their futures and those of their families . "

BBC News , Gaza
Mariam El - Sharif was born a year ago into a world of conflict and violence .
Her extended family crowds around a cake with one pink candle on it .
The walls of this front room in northern Gaza are still riddled with bullet and mortar shell holes .
Life is hard for my daughter - we still live in fear in Gaza and there is no hope that life will get better
Saadiyia al - Sharif , Gaza resident Israel began a three - week long assault on Gaza , a couple of hours after Mariam came in to the world .
Panic and chaos spread throughout Gaza 's main hospital .
Israel says its operation was aimed at Palestinian militants , who for years had been firing rockets at Israeli families over the border .
But hundreds of Gaza 's civilians were killed and thousands were injured in Israel 's military campaign .
Born prematurely , Mariam spent the war here in an incubator .
Her mother was sent home to make room for the wounded .
I met Saadiya Sharif days after the war .
She had just been reunited with her daughter .
" I 'm always holding her .
I do n't let her out of my sight now , " she told me .
" It was very difficult .
Mariam was in the hospital without me for 21 days .
We could n't leave our house to pick her up because of the shelling .
Israeli soldiers were based across the road from us . "
Frustrations
One year later Gaza is still bruised and battered and Mariam is still sickly .
We went with her and her mother to a UN clinic .
GAZA CONFLICT CASUALTIES Total Palestinian deaths :
1,409 ( PCHR )
1,387 ( B' Tselem )
1,166 ( Israeli military ) Palestinian children killed :
326 ( under 17 , PCHR )
252 ( under 16 , B'tselem )
89 ( under 16 , Israeli military ) Palestinian civilians killed :
916 * ( PCHR )
773* ( B'tselem )
295 plus 162 unknown ( Israeli military ) Israelis killed :
3 civilians
10 security forces ( includes 4 by friendly fire ) * Figs exclude about 250 Hamas police officers
PCHR=Palestinian Human Rights Centre , B'Tselem=Israeli human rights group
Voices : Gaza , one year on Gaza : Still on a knife edge
Two families struggle to recover Gallery : Impact on Gaza children Locals return to rocket - hit towns Mariam is examined regularly there , but the medicine she needs is often unavailable or too expensive .
Israel allows basic humanitarian supplies in to Gaza but it still has a punishing blockade in place here .
Israel says the aim is to put pressure on the militants , but the people of Gaza say everyone suffers .
Last month , the World Health Organization warned that 125 of 480 essential drugs were at " zero level " .
This means there was less than one month 's supply left .
Israel allows most medicines into Gaza , but amounts can vary and their transfer can be slowed by Israeli and Palestinian bureaucracy .
The entry of medical equipment and other goods is severely limited .
After weighing and measuring Mariam , Dr Salim Ramadan told us of the frustrations of being a doctor in Gaza .
He said Mariam 's case was typical .
He often prescribes medicines to patients that either turn out not to be available in Gaza or that have been smuggled in from Egypt through the tunnels but at such a cost that few Gazans can pay .
' What to do ? ' he said .
' We have 65 % of people living here under the poverty line and the situation is just getting worse . '
Mrs Sharif is also exasperated .
As a mother , she should be able to provide for her daughter , she says , but she could n't give Mariam her breastmilk when she was born as they were kept apart by the war and now , a year later , she still can't protect her - economically , medically or in terms of safety .
" Life is hard for my daughter .
We still live in fear in Gaza and there is there is no hope that life will get better , " she says .
" She wants to be like children in the Western world - to play , to have complete freedom .
In the future , if she wants to travel , if she wants a normal life , she can't have this in Gaza .
Israel 's siege controls our lives . "
Twelve months after Israel 's military operation in Gaza , Hamas , Israel 's enemy , remains in power while ordinary people feel unable to pick up the pieces of their lives Mariam 's family like so many others here say they trust no - one and fear for the future .

The continued presence of European troops in Afghanistan , and the hope of a few more , demonstrates how Europe 's apathy can be worked around .
Washington can still pressure governments to lead their populations rather than merely follow their wishes .
And it can be pointed out that combat , which is what European publics are specifically averse to , constitutes only a small part of the military activity we are likely to see in the 21st century .
True , warfare will always be about killing , but militaries will be used in more and more ingenious ways .
Counterinsurgency , in and of itself , while it requires monopolizing the use of force in any given space , is often about avoiding manhunts and concentrating on rural development projects , as well as the training of indigenous forces .
There is much work in Afghanistan that European troops can theoretically perform without alienating citizenries back home who are conflicted about the use of force -- more so now that counterinsurgency will be emphasized over counter - terrorism .
The way the world is shaping up , America will have no choice but to yank Europe kicking and screaming into conflict zones , even as America will have to learn to live with all of the restrictions that come with European forces .
Consider : China is rising as a great power , particularly in the naval sphere .
The U.S. will not fight a war with China , but it will leverage like - minded , democratic others such as India , Indonesia , Australia , South Korea , and Japan to help manage Chinese ascendancy in the maritime rimland of Eurasia .
This will take a lot of work , and a lot of ships .
And with the U.S. increasingly tied up in the Indian and Pacific oceans as the years and decades march on , it will help to rely increasingly on European forces to cover the the Atlantic and Africa for them .
Imagine a state collapse in the oil - rich Gulf of Guinea , and then think how a neopacifist Europe could still help with humanitarian assistance , relieving the U.S. of some of the burden .
In fact , if one is looking for a way in which a debellicized Europe can make a difference , it is in the naval sphere .
European countries such as Holland , Norway , Germany , and Spain have , in fact , been investing over the years in various kinds of warships .
Since Europe increasingly seeks to avoid conflict and geopolitics altogether , an emphasis on sea power makes sense .
Sea power is inherently less threatening than land power .
It is the limited capacity of navies to extend force inland that makes sea power no threat to liberty , wrote Alfred Thayer Mahan in 1900 .
Sea power allows for sizable military missions with a small on - shore footprint .
And because of the slow rate at which ships travel , sea power enables more diplomacy than is possible with lightning quick air maneuvers and airborne insertions of ground forces .
Sea power is also perfectly suited for many types of rescue missions , as the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 demonstrated .
I got this cute little embroidery that says " happy fuckin ' holidays , devilpliers " which I think is the coolest part of the gift .
I 've used that name online for over 10 years , so it 's not just my reddit username . ;)
I was also just talking online somewhere the other day about how I needed something to hang on my walls , but I do n't think it ended up in my comments .
Kind of strange .
I hung it up next to my front door , and took a pic of it .
I also got Triops .
So , these things kinda freak me out , but my best friend has some and she says they can't live outside of the water .
I 'll probably grow them .
I wish I could attach a few pics so I could show you how weird it looks .
I also got a book called " How to eat like a child " which seems like something I probably should read , I 'm far too serious sometimes .
Also , a candy poopin penguin and one of those water inflatable Buddha things .
I did n't put in any explanation for what I wanted , and I 'm kinda glad I did n't .
I liked the surprise , and the handmade part of the gift was awesome .
I also stalked my SS afterwards , and I thought this comment of hers was funny in the right context :
" Everybody at work thinks I am crazy .
I 've had to explain the concept of Reddit so many times I decided to just go with " There 's a website of 4000 + people and we 're having a secret santa .
I 'm embroidering this for my person and " xxxxx " is their username . "
Makes me wonder what all those people thought devil pliers were .
There was some interesting feedback on my last article , and I ended up wanting to say too much in reply that here I am again , typing at the ether .
Stephen reflects the common confusion that somehow this is just a little file that might or might not work .
No man , this is Guile !
That 's the implementation of Guile 's eval .
So unit tests , yes , we have more than 12000 of them .
Only some of them specifically test the evaluator , but all of them go through the evaluator .
But to be honest , I think unit tests help , but when I 'm hacking the compiler the most useful test is to simply rebuild the compiler .
If it successfully bootstraps , usually we 're doing pretty well .
Zed raises a more direct criticism :
This is why I hate lisp : [ link to my article ]
Long and dense , no comments , not semantic .
That 's " awesome code " ?
I do n't think I used the word " awesome " , but yes , I believe so , in the sense of " inspiring awe " -- at least for me .
I 'm going to call on my homie Alan Kay for some support here .
There was an oft - cited interview with Alan Kay a few years back , when he described eval as " Maxwell 's equations of software " .
I quote :
[ Interviewer : ]
If nothing else , Lisp was carefully defined in terms of Lisp .
[ Alan Kay : ]
Yes , that was the big revelation to me when I was in graduate school — when I finally understood that the half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself .
These were “ Maxwell ’s Equations of Software ! ”
This is the whole world of programming in a few lines that I can put my hand over .
I realized that anytime I want to know what I ’m doing , I can just write down the kernel of this thing in a half page and it ’s not going to lose any power .
In fact , it ’s going to gain power by being able to reenter itself much more readily than most systems done the other way can possibly do .
Just for context , here is that half - a- page -- Maxwell 's equations of software :
evalquote is defined by using two main functions , called eval and apply .
apply handles a function and its arguments , while eval handles forms .
Each of these functions also has another argument that is used as an association list for storing the values of bound variables and function names .
evalquote [ fn ; x ] = apply [ fn ; x; NIL ] where apply [ fn ; x;a ] = [ atom [ fn ] → [ eq [ fn ; CAR ] → caar[ x ] ; eq [ fn ; CDR ] → cdar[x ] ; eq [ fn ; CONS ] → cons[ car[ x ] ; cadr[ x ] ] ; eq [ fn ; ATOM ] → atom [ car[ x ] ] ; eq[ fn ; EQ ] → eq[ car[ x ] ; cadr[x ] ] ; T → apply [ eval [ fn ;a ] ; x;a ] ] ; eq[ car[ fn ] ; LAMBDA ] → eval [ caddr [ fn ] ; pairlis [ cadr [fn ] ; x;a ] ] ; eq[ car[ fn ] ; LABEL ] → apply [ caddr[ fn ] ; x;cons[cons [ cadr[fn ] ; caddr[fn ] ] ; a ] ] ] eval [ e ;a ] = [ atom [ e ] → cdr[assoc [ e ;a ] ] ; atom [ car[e ] ] → [ eq [ car[e ] ; QUOTE ] → cadr[e ] ; eq[ car[e ] ; COND ] → evcon[ cdr[ e ] ; a ] ; T → apply [ car[e ] ; evlis [ cdr[ e ] ; a ] ; a ] ] ; T → apply [ car[e ] ; evlis [ cdr [ e ] ; a] ;a ] ] pairlis and assoc have been previously defined .
evcon [ c ; a ] = [ eval [ caar [ c ] ; a ] → eval [ cadar [ c ] ;a ] ; T → evcon[ cdr [ c ] ;a ] ] and evlis [ m;a ] = [ null[m ] → NIL ; T → cons[ eval [ car[ m ] ;a] ;evlis[ cdr [ m ] ; a ] ] ]
From the LISP 1.5 Programmer 's Manual
What a mess !
Where are the unit tests ?
Where are the comments ?
A little bit of whitespace , please !
They use " cdar " , " caar " , and " cadr " .
They should be using named accessors !
What if you eval an atom that 's not found in the association list ?
Did they really name a function " evlis " ?
Et cetera .
Now , I do think the LISP 1.5 ( it was n't yet spelled " Lisp " then ) evaluator is awesome , as it was in McCarthy 's first papers on the subject .
If you disagree with that , that 's cool , I see why one would " hate " my poor imitation .
But given the Lisp history of meta - circular evaluators , one does n't need to comment every one as if it were the first .
In the same way that one recognizes an if statement without the need for a design pattern behind it , I would want anyone who 's hacking on Guile 's evaluator to have read or perhaps even written several evaluators ; and once you 've written one , you know the pattern .
More substantively , Charles speculates on source - to - source transformations to ease interpretation .
I admit almost total ignorance regarding PreScheme ; I 've been meaning to learn about it for years now .
But the point of this evaluator was to have it use the same representation as VM - compiled procedures ; ideally it should run fast , but the first priority is for it to run on the VM itself instead of on a separate stack .
There 's certainly many more clever things that can be done there , and thankfully since eval is implemented in Scheme and compiled like anything else , it will also reap advantages of an improving compiler .
Regarding Emacs , I hope to say more on that point within a week or so , when the video for my talk at the recent GNU Hackers Meeting gets put up .
Finally , Bubo asks if this work is in a released tarball .
Not yet is the answer , but it will be in Tuesday 's 1.9.6 release .
Happy hacking !
The television show Lost has been going on now for five seasons , with the final season starting in 2010 .
It 's a rich show filled with strong characters and a deep underlying mythology .
Unfortunately things on the Island do n't always work out the same way they would in the real world .
I 've taken observations and compiled them into a series of ten laws ; not laws in the physical sense , but more like laws of the universe , or Laws of the Island if you will .
These are a great way to help new viewers follow along with the storyline and understand what most of us already know .
The Speed Limit is 5 MPH and it is Enforced Slow the fuck down or you 'll get your ass beat .
More sinister than any other phenomena attached to the Island is its strange and bewildering ability to have vines , roots , dead falls , branches , sticks , fallen trees , moss , mud , rocks , gorges , rivers , streams and rotting carcasses whose sole purpose to to handout a faceplant to anybody moving at a faster pace than a brisk walk .
In the event that the Island is not able to trip the offender itself , an antagonist is immediately dispatched to coldcock , trip or deliver a flying tackle to provide the same function .
Consider the entire Island to be a school zone .
If you do n't want to be on the receiving end of a beatdown , do not exceed the speed limit at any time .
Healing Powers Only Work on Major Injuries
That 's the stuff of nightmares .
The exception to this is John Locke .
Sure Locke 's spine was healed , but what about his face ?
In the first episode Locke has a nasty cut extending from his right cheek to his forehead , right across the eye and yet despite this increased ability to heal , the cut not only does n't close completely for several days , but it consequentially scars , leaving the gash right on his face indefinitely .
I can only guess that the Island seems to be a fan of Apocalypse Now and believes that it can make its bald dictator - like guy even more bad - ass by scarring him in the face .
If the same idea is further expanded on , a papercut would likely never close on the Island and the victim would need to chop off his hand in order to stop the bleeding .
This would also explain why Jack Shephard appears to suffer from asthma so bad that it borders on emphysema .
Every Show Can be Improved with a Murray Head Reference - No Exceptions
Now that 's why you do n't play with M - 80s .
Bear with me here .
In the first season finale " Exodus " , Arzt accidentally kills himself by detonating a stick of dynamite outside of the Black Rock .
Siam 's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha
In this scene Siam refers to the Black Rock itself , which was a slave ship destined for Siam when it was lost .
It towers over the other characters .
Arzt 's explanation of the proper way to handle dynamite and after his death , the other characters ' struggle to transport it could be considered ' the ultimate test of cerebral fitness ' .
The scene of course is quite thrilling , and ' grips me more than would a muddy old river ' , which of course the Island also has in abundance .
Even the character of Jacob is a reference to the song , as it describes how he continually duels for control of the Island , using the Others as his pawns :
And thank God I 'm only watching the game -- controlling it -- Simply put , every show is improved by the addition of One Night in Bankok references .
People with Knowledge of the Future are Dicks Daniel Faraday : Dick .
Hell no !
They do n't even try to stop the plane crash !
Between all of them , they had decades to make sure that the plane never took off and enough money to buy up the airline and close it down altogether .
But no , they decide to twiddle their collective thumbs and let several dozen people die .
Nice .
The sad fact is that Lost has taught us that people who know what 's going to happen are utter dicks .
It is Not Possible for Dominoes to Make Their 30 - Minute Guarantee on the Island The Pearl Station has a McDonalds .
The 30 - minute time dilation that effects the Island would mean disaster for Dominoes .
Lets say that the pizza takes 15 minutes to make , and the pizza guy has a high - powered motor boat that can easily do 60 mph if not more .
Well given the temporal distortion , the pizza would be 20 minutes late and thus free .
Needless to say , this would have disastrous repercussions for the franchise , and they 'd either get shut down by the branch office for continually giving away free pizza , or they would have to discontinue the 30 - minute guarantee at that location .
Business would likely suffer after that .
Everybody on the Island is Connected to Everybody Else This man is connected to everybody on the Island .
Twice .
No matter how bizarre , you will have a link to everybody on the Island at any given time .
Your brother 's best friend once bought cocaine from the second cousin twice removed of the guy you 're talking to .
Your mother visited a hairdresser that later became a dog groomer that prepared the pooch that won out in the dog show against their third grade teacher 's niece 's prized poodle 's now - grown puppies .
It might be strange , but it seems to be a continuation of Murphy 's Law .
If you could possibly be related to another person , you will be .
It 's the six degrees of Kevin Bacon , except , unless he's on the Island , Mr. Bacon is n't involved and there 's about a hundred times more degrees .
Also , as an addendum , the less people who are involved at the time , the more convoluted the links can become .
Just About Everything on the Island is Hallucinogenic Charlie 's having a freakout and Sayed is tripping balls .
It 's the brown acid that the singer called out for you not to eat at that crazy concert , all the time .
Whatever it is , it seems to also be addictive , in that people who leave the Island seem to go through a form of withdrawal and begin to crave the Island .
Like crack addicts , they have to return for their next fix .
It also appears that this substance is fat soluble , as Hurley , arguably the fattest tub to ever not get eaten by panthers while in a survival situation on a tropical island , not only continues to hallucinate , but does n't feel the same compulsion to return to the Island that his skinnier compatriots do .
Likely his fat tissue is storing the hallucinogen and gradually releasing it into his system as he slowly loses weight in an insane asylum .
You Can't Lose Weight on the Island Put down the ranch dressing you fat tub .
These are people who are eating very little , losing water weight by the gallon due to a humid tropical climate and doing work such as manual labor and running ( with the inevitable falling down ) .
By all accounts , they should be stick people , and Hurley should be at his ideal BMI .
Somehow , they all manage to retain more or less the exact same weight that they had when they arrived .
The only explanation has to be weight gain powder slipped into the ranch dressing .
Most People on the Island Can't Grasp the Plot of Back to the Future Great Scott !
It can be theorized that the Island seems to reject or kill anybody who 's enjoyed the adventures of Marty McFly and Doc Emmett L. Brown as they travel between the years 1955 and 2015 .
Since Miles was born on the Island he seems to be exempt from this law .
Anybody on the Island would be well advised to not utter the phrases " Great Scott ! " , " Make like a tree and get out of here ! " or " This is heavy . " for fear of accidentally getting themselves killed .

January 2010 sees the publication of the result of the National Centre for Social Research ’s 26th British Social Attitudes study .
As a bit of teaser for the main report , NatCen has released a snapshot of this year ’s findings which makes for very interesting reading – or should that be depressing reading , if you happen to be a social conservative .
As a confirmed secularist one of the more cheering aspects of the study ’s findings is that religious belief is declining rapidly .
In 1983 , only 34 % said that they did not belong to any religion .
In the new study that ’s risen to 46 % and the study appears to support the view that the decline in the prevalence of religious belief is primarily a function of generational changes in attitudes :
These changes reflect deep - rooted differences between the generations , with older generations ( who are the most religious ) dying out and being replaced by younger ( less religious ) ones .
This does n’t appear to indicate a corresponding rise in number of people who identify themselves as atheists , although it appear that membership of no - god squad now exceeds the number of people who are certain that god exists , although the figures given by Andrew Brown seem to be a bit garbled .
Having given the figures for non-believers and people who have no doubts about the existence of their favourite sky - fairy as being 18 % and 17 % respectively , Brown goes on to note that :
If you ask whether people believe in God , identify with a religion and attend services , the figure in Britain is only 25 % , as opposed to the 31 % who do none of these things …
Which seems to indicate that 31 % of people do not believe in god , in addition to not identifying with a religion and not attending services .
As Terry Jones noted , when talking about the furore that surrounded the original release of ‘ The Life of Brian ’ , the Python ’s found it impossible to take the piss out of the Biblical character of Jesus and the central moral content of the gospels precisely because it does contain a solid core of sound moral philosophy that stands up independently of any appeals to supernatural authority .
Elsewhere in the study it appears that the British population continues to become more liberal in its outlook on a range of moral and social issues .
The number of people who said that they absolutely or mostly disapprove of sex before marriage fell from 28 % in 1983 to only 11 % today , although its not clear as yet how many answered that question by cracking gags like ‘ only if the bridesmaid is n’t up for it ’ or ‘ only if it holds up the ceremony ’ .
Attitudes towards the gay community are also improving .
In 1983 , 62 % said that they thought that sexual relations between adults of the same sex were wrong .
Today that figure has fallen to 34 % and if , as the evidence for religious belief suggests , difference in attitudes between generations account for most of the change then , even though its not as good as it might be , there ’s probably nothing much that could n’t be quickly sorted out with a decent flu pandemic .
The study also confirms that support for abortion rights is solid , even in the face of the recent , and massively dishonest , anti-abortion campaigns mounted by the Christian Taliban and its fellow travellers ( Nadine Dorries ) .
Support for the proposition that a woman who decides herself that she does not want a child should be allowed to have an abortion has risen from 37 % in 1983 to 60 % today .
Most of the studies main findings are hardly novel or surprising .
Young people are more liberal in their outlook than older people and graduates are both more liberal and more likely to interested in and / or engaged in politics than non-graduates .
Education is a truly a wonderful thing , and all more so , from where I ’m sitting , for the fact that it seems likely to bode ill for the long - term prospects of the Daily Mail .
Having cracked the half - life gag earlier , I did wonder whether it might be possible to make a similar inference about the currrent readership of the Daily Mail and work out what their half - life might be …
… then I remembered what the comments are like over at the Mail ’s site and realised that a half - life in just their normal state of being .
South African trainer Herman Brown has brought Mourilyan out for Tuesday 's Cup and if the highly fancied stayer gets up , the $ 3.3 million prize money and the gold cup will be headed for Grozny , Chechnya 's capital .
" It 's a moral dilemma .
If Kim Jong - il applies to have a horse run next time , what should we do ? " said Australian National University academic Leonid Petrov .
" Perhaps there should be stricter criteria put forward for applicants .
" Kadyrov is implicated in many nasty things in Chechnya , in Russia and outside the borders of Russia .
Personal enemies of Kadyrov die like flies in Russia and also in Dubai . "
Russian security forces last week foiled an assassination attempt on Kadyrov , who thrives on the financial and political backing of the Kremlin .
" Lots of money has been pumped into Chechnya to prop up the regime of Kadyrov , " Dr Petrov said .
" How much of this money has been used on his horses , we do n't know but if the horse wins , the money will be the personal property of Ramzan Kadyrov .
" In that case it will become quite questionable whether the Melbourne Cup is participating in an international money laundering scheme . "
Brown said he was aware of the controversy surrounding Kadyrov , whom he has only met once and communicates with through a government interpreter .
" I 'm obviously aware of what people talk about , " he said .
" I 'm not really sure I 'm the man to really talk about it .
I 'm just concentrating on the race .
" I do n't know this [ allegations against Kadyrov ] for a fact .
Maybe after the Cup , I 'll investigate it . "
British racing authorities are investigating Kadyrov and will rule in February whether to ban his horses from competing in the country .
If a British ban is enforced , he is likely to be shunned globally .
" Clearly we have to abide by the laws of whatever country we race in , " Brown said .
Brown said it was his idea to bring Mourilyan - which races in the red , white and green colours of the Chechen flag - to the Melbourne Cup and he has very little direct contact with Kadyrov who will watch the race in Grozny .
" He 's easy to deal with , " Brown said .
" I 've met him once in Dubai last December and he was very pleasant to me .
" As an owner and a business relationship , the guy 's great .
He buys expensive horses , he pays the bills really well and he does n't interfere with the training .
Ask any trainer and they 're the criteria you want from an owner . "

Twelve years after the Royal College of Physicans warned about the practice of “ switching the patients out with the lights ” in old people ’s homes , and a decade since the Alzheimer ’s Society first demanded an end to the use of the “ liquid cosh ” , the Government yesterday announced an action plan to tackle over - prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs to elderly people .
Ministers ’ belated response to the problem was highlighted by an independent review , published yesterday , which estimated 180,000 people with dementia are currently receiving powerful cocktails of sedative drugs of whom over three quarters - 144,000 - are being prescribed them inappropriately .
The drugs are estimated to cause 1,800 deaths and 1,620 strokes a year but despite warnings about the risks prescribing has continued .
The findings of the review , commissioned by the Department of Health in June 2008 in response to pressure from charities for the elderly , echo those of the RCP ’s report more than a decade ago which warned too many care home residents with dementia were spending their final months and years in a state of suspended consciousness occupying a half - world , waiting for death to come .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Doctors have warned for years about the overuse of antipsychotic drugs - normally prescribed for schizophrenia - to keep challenging residents of old people 's homes quiet and easy to manage .
Some refer to it as a “ chemical ball and chain ” .
Why spend time and energy keeping an eye out for an Alzheimer 's sufferer who is prone to wander when you can effectively lock him in his chair with high doses of risperidone or haloperidol ?
There are an estimated 700,000 people in Britain with dementia , most with Alzheimer ’s disease , of whom more than half suffer symptoms of agitation , aggression , wandering , shouting and other difficult behaviours .
Antipsychotic drugs are recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence for short term use in severe cases to curb distressing symptoms .
But in almost 80 per cent of cases in which they are prescribed , they are given long term or inappropriately and “ cause more harm than good ” , Professor Bannerjee said .
The Care Services minister , Phil Hope , accepting the 11 recommendations in the review including local targets to reduce prescribing of antipsychotics by two thirds over three years , said : “ It is unacceptable that antipsychotic drugs are routinely prescribed to people with dementia . ”
However , Mr Hope , announced no new funding to back the recommendations , which include better training in dementia for health and social care staff , improved access to psychological therapies for patients and more specialist dementia teams .
Professor Bannerjee said the cost of his proposals , estimated at £ 450,000 for each primary care trust , equivalent to £ 68 million for England , would have to come from existing resources .
“ There is a need for PCTs to commission extra capacity to provide specialist dementia teams , ” he said .
Neil Hunt , chief executive of the Alzheimer ’s Society , hailed publication of the review as a “ landmark ” .
But he added that there was a “ resourcing question ” .
Mr Hope said he had visited a home where use of the drugs had been reduced by 62 per cent after managers organised specialist dementia training for the staff , including simple steps to reduce agitation in affected individuals .
He said : “ Substantial resources are being spent on dementia care .
This is about making sure that the money spent is spent to the best effect .
I have visited care homes where it is being done .
If it can be done in one home it can be done in every home . ”
Paul Burstow , a Liberal Democrat MP who has been campaigning on the issue for years , said the measures were long overdue .
“ This review comes much too late for thousands of elderly people whose lives have been cut short by the reckless prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs . ”
Plastic may be fantastic , but it takes an awful lot of petroleum to make it .
As such , efforts to cut oil use in the U.S. have produced , among other results , a budding bioplastics industry specializing in plastic manufacturing that relies less on oil for its raw material and more on biomass , carbon dioxide or even microorganisms such as Escherichia coli .
Such efforts got a boost Monday when Ithaca , N.Y. –based Novomer , Inc. , announced an $ 800,000 effort co-funded by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority ( NYSERDA ) to begin commercializing the company 's polypropylene carbonate ( PPC ) materials , made using a combination of CO2 and petroleum .
By adding CO2 , Novomer uses half as much oil as that which is required to make conventional plastics , says Mike Slowik , Novomer 's manager of strategic planning and analysis .
Conventional plastics include polystyrene ( used to make packaging foam ) and polycarbonate ( for compact discs and eyeglasses ) .
Novomer 's process works by employing a zinc - based catalyst to bond environmental by - products such as CO2 to liquid epoxides ( a highly reactive ether ) in a reactor that produces the same result as a pressure cooker , albeit with less energy required in terms of temperature and pressure .
The resulting material is a honeylike liquid that companies can use to make plastic products including bottles , clear packaging wrap and scratch - resistant coatings .
Kodak Specialty Chemicals , along with Rochester Institute of Technology , plans to provide Novomer with the equipment and facilities needed to scale up production .
With Kodak 's help Novomer has been able to make sample batches of up to 14 kilograms at a time , Slowik says .
Novomer 's long - term goal is to get additional big manufacturers to use its CO2 - based polymers in the plastic products they make and sell .
NYSERDA , a state - charted corporation that promotes research and development aimed at reducing New York State 's dependence on petroleum , began working with Novomer in December 2008 on a $ 150,000 feasibility study .
The results convinced Novomer to move forward with its work developing catalyst chemicals used to create PPC materials that can be produced with existing manufacturing infrastructures at a competitive cost to petroleum - based plastics .
NYSERDA considered a number of projects aimed at developing , demonstrating or commercializing new energy - efficient technologies for use in the industrial processes in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors before choosing Novomer , according to NYSERDA spokesperson Colleen Ryan .
" With about 10 percent of all crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. being used for plastics manufacturing , the benefits of ( Novomer 's ) PPC being commercialized are not only for a greener solution when compared to current materials , " she says .
" It is also lower in cost and offers higher performance for many applications . "

University of Queensland researchers are testing new materials to withstand the extreme heat experienced by hypersonic vehicles in flight so they can fly for substantially longer .
Previous Australian experimental flight tests of scramjets , a type of very fast jet engine , have not lasted longer than five seconds .
The tests , conducted at Woomera in South Australia over the past eight years , have used scramjet engines made of conventional materials which have problems with extreme heat including melting , and are not designed for re-use .
Source : Professor Michael Smart , Professor John Drennan , David Yu of The University of Queensland .
However , further experimental tests are planned in 2011 through to 2013 in the HiFIRE series at Woomera using free - flying engines and eventually , a whole free - flying vehicle which will generate enough thrust to fly for a minute .
The leader of UQ's Hyshot scramjet experiment program and UQ Professor in Hypersonic Propulsion , Professor Michael Smart said the project was testing new composite materials for the longer flights at Mach 8 ( eight times the speed of sound ) .
“ If they can fly for a minute , they can fly for an hour , ” he said .
“ A scramjet - powered vehicle could fly between London and Australia in two hours so we 're looking at materials that can survive hypersonic speeds for longer periods . ”
[ Hypersonics is the study of flight speeds faster than Mach 5 ( five times the speed of sound or more than twice as fast as the Concorde ) .
Supersonic speed is greater than Mach 1 , while modern commercial airliners fly below the speed of sound . ]
Professor Smart said the research was particularly looking at new materials for leading edges , the parts of the wings that first contact the air .
In high speed aircraft , air friction can cause extreme heating of the leading edge — temperatures on the surface of an object travelling at Mach 5 can reach 1000 degrees C ( 1800 deg F ) .
These high temperatures can not be sustained by most materials .
Another challenging problem area is inside the scramjet engine , which must handle a corrosive mix of hot oxygen and combustion products , as well as high thermal , mechanical and acoustic loadings .
At higher speeds the temperatures can be even more extreme — for example at Mach 8 the temperatures can reach 2700 degress C at the leading edge and 3000 degrees C in the engine combustion chamber .
Extreme heating of the leading edge was the cause of the Space Shuttle Columbia accident during re-entry in 2003 .
The accident was preceded by damage to protective tiles on the leading edge which occurred during takeoff .
Professor Smart said hypersonic propulsion heating problems could be overcome through the selection of materials , as well as design and cooling arrangements .
He is working with ceramic composite materials pioneer Professor John Drennan , Director of UQ's Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis , and postdoctoral researchers Dr James Turner and Dr Anna Lashtabeg on the current project .
Student David Yu ( School of ITEE , eResearch Centre ) has prepared animations showing processes occurring at extreme temperatures .
Professor Drennan is looking at a number of concepts to enable hypersonics vehicles to handle extreme heat for prolonged periods .
One of the concepts that is looking promising is to design materials which ablate at high temperature .
However , unlike the usual systems where material is lost to the surroundings , this new material is able to replenish the lost material through microstructural design .
“ The technologies we are developing will have application anywhere where performance is needed from materials in high temperature environments for long periods , ” he said .
“ Some potential uses for the new materials might include in power plants and for exhaust nozzles of jet engines . ”
Professor Drennan said the technologies developed would benefit Australian industry by providing further capabilities in materials science .
“ Australian industries will be able to build components of aircraft , rather than having to import these materials from the U.S. and Europe , ” he said .

The security at the red - brick and glass - walled horseshoe of the John Joseph Moakley courthouse on Boston 's waterfront was unusually tight .
Anybody who was not a member of the city 's bar association was swept with a search wand .
Photo IDs were checked .
Mobile phones were taken from guests , who included the Hollywood star Tom Cruise .
The occasion was a memorial service for Scientology 's top legal adviser for a quarter of a century , Earle Cooley .
The controversial head of Scientology worldwide , David Miscavige , delivered the eulogy , thanking his late friend for his contribution to the neo-religion during his career , much of which was spent pursuing journalists and former members who spoke out against it .
Miscavige may since have wondered privately what Cooley would have made of the events of last week .
Scientology , founded in 1953 by the late science fiction pulp novelist , serial fantasist and inveterate self - publicist L Ron Hubbard , is under fire again across the globe , following years of struggle to be recognised – with some success – as a legitimate church .
The church has just been denounced in the strongest possible terms in the Australian parliament .
Prime minister Kevin Rudd has expressed his concern over allegations of " a worldwide pattern of abuse and criminality " and is contemplating a parliamentary inquiry .
The organisation is under police investigation and yesterday angry ex-Scientologists , spurred on by the claims , converged on its Australian headquarters calling for its tax - exempt status to be revoked .
And it is not only in Australia that Scientology is facing problems .
A new book in America – Blown for Good : Behind the Iron Curtain of the Church of Scientology – by Marc Headley , an employee of the church 's Los Angeles headquarters for 15 years , details – as others have – allegations of systematic abuse and bizarre episodes , such as the three weeks Headley claims he spent under instruction from Cruise in how to move bottles and other objects by concentrating on them .
Headley 's book follows a year in which Scientology has been plagued by unwelcome revelations from high - profile defectors and fresh media investigation into its practices .
Last month the church narrowly avoided being banned in France after being prosecuted for fraud , following claims that four leaders – all given suspended jail sentences – had preyed financially on several followers in the 1990s .
In Belgium , too , Scientology is embroiled in a long criminal investigation .
Perhaps most embarrassing for an organisation that prides itself on its wealthy Hollywood followers , Oscar - winning director Paul Haggis , an adherent of 30 years , abandoned Scientology in October , accusing it of homophobia .
That is not all .
Some of the worst damage done to Scientology in the past two years appears to have been self - inflicted .
Earlier this year the official spokesman in the US , Tommy Davis , son of the actress Anne Archer , stormed out of an ABC TV interview with Martin Bashir when Bashir had the temerity to ask about one of its central beliefs – relating to an evil intergalactic warlord named Xenu .
More ridicule was invited , unwittingly , by Cruise , the church 's most high - profile member , in a leaked video produced for the organisation last year that went viral on the internet .
It showed a rambling Cruise laughing inexplicably while saying that Scientologists were uniquely equipped with the knowledge necessary to cure most of the world 's ills , including crime , drugs , mental health problems and violence .
A religion to some , a business certainly , and a cult to many , whose innermost cadres wear pseudo naval uniforms , Scientology 's religious tenets are a mixture of therapy - style self - improvement steps – at least at first – mixed with a weird space - opera metaphysics , which is revealed only to its highest acolytes .
The church has frequently been accused of breaking up families and preying on the vulnerable .
The history of Scientology and its critics has been a story played out in the courts in interminable proceedings that supported Cooley 's very lucrative career , underwritten by a very lucrative religious practice in which followers pay large sums of money to progress through a series of training courses called " auditing " .
In a quote attributed in the US courts to the late Hubbard himself , it is made clear that the court cases serve a useful purpose , even when they are lost .
According to Hubbard , " law can be used very easily to harass ...
If possible , of course , ruin… entirely . "
Scientology has attempted to sue newspapers , including the Washington Post .
Time magazine beat off a court claim for $ 400 m after describing the church on its cover as " the Cult of Greed " .
It has pursued authors , those who have campaigned against it , defectors and rivals .
It has also made unsuccessful claims that details of its most secret practices should be regarded as both copyright and a trade secret .
The repeated attempts to use the courts to silence critics have been criticised in the judgments that have been upheld against Scientology , including one in 1996 that described its " documented history of vexatious behaviour " and abuse of " the [ US ] federal court system by using it , inter alia , to destroy their opponents , rather than to resolve an actual dispute over trademark law or any other legal matter " .
So when Nick Xenophon stood up last week in the Australian parliament he was the latest critic in a long line .
Xenophon made a carefully calculated decision – to use the protection of parliamentary privilege to denounce an organisation that he claims " abuses its followers , viciously targets its critics and seems largely driven by paranoia " .
Xenophon 's aim was simple : to challenge the tax - exempt status of Scientology as a religion .
If the allegations Xenophon detailed – including the claims by former high - ranking members that David Miscavige physically assaulted senior Scientologists – were familiar ones to critics of the movement , Xenophon 's speech brought to the widest audience possible a synthesis of the recent and not so recent claims against the leadership of Scientology , allegations picked up worldwide within minutes of him speaking .
He described claims of " false imprisonment , coerced abortions , embezzlement of church funds , physical violence , blackmail and the widespread deliberate abuse of information obtained by the organisation " .
At the centre of Xenophon 's long , impassioned speech were the allegations of Aaron Saxton , who was " born " into Scientology and " rose to a position of influence in Sydney and the United States " .
According to Xenophon , Saxton 's abuse started as a child when his mother was coerced into signing over guardianship of him to the organisation and he was made a security guard at the age of 16 .
" In 1991 Aaron says he was sent to Scientology headquarters in Florida where he was involved in … putting five individuals under house arrest " and " ordered by superiors to remove documents that would link a Scientology staff member to murder " .
" Aaron says women who fell pregnant were taken to offices and bullied to have an abortion .
If they refused , they faced demotion and hard labour …
Aaron says one staff member used a coat - hanger and self - aborted her child for fear of punishment .
He says she was released from the organisation and the files were destroyed . "
Saxton also " ordered more than 30 people to be sent to Scientology 's work camps , where they were forced to undertake hard labour " , Xenophon said .
He said another former Scientologist , Carmel Underwood , who worked as a financial officer in the organisation and claims to have been assaulted by another member , " witnessed a young girl who had been molested by her father being coached as to what she should say to investigating authorities in order to keep the crimes secret " .
In a letter described by Xenophon as " one of the saddest correspondences I have received " , a father , Paul Schofield , admits to being part of a cover -up of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of his two daughters .
The Church of Scientology in Australia 's response last week was to accuse Xenophon of abusing parliamentary privilege and adding that the allegations were " unquestionably false " .
" This was not free speech .
It was abuse and slander protected by the forms of our parliament , " spokesman Cyrus Brooks said in a statement .
It did not , however , reply to a series of written questions from the Observer about the cases detailed .
But if something has changed in the past few years , it has been the emergence of an increasingly empowered and vocal global opposition to the Scientologists .
The development has been fuelled in part by the internet 's Anonymous movement – which posted the Tom Cruise video to YouTube last year – and has been behind a series of denial - of - service attacks on Scientology websites , protests and prank calls since the Scientologists had it removed it from the site , inevitably claiming copyright infringement .
The Australian intervention by Xenophon was part of a wider and growing backlash against one of the world 's most controversial movements .
If there has been a catalyst for many of the Scientologists ' most recent problems it has been provided by a newspaper in Florida – the St Petersburg Times – which covers the area including the organisation 's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater .
The paper ran an investigative series featuring interviews with former members of the church 's leadership .
These included Marty Rathbun and Mike Rinder , two of the highest - ranking executives to leave Scientology .
According to the two men's accounts – denounced as " lies " by Miscavige and Tommy Davis – Miscavige routinely assaulted his lieutenants , including Rinder , 50 times .
In one article , citing the testimony of four former members , the newspaper described Miscavige administering a vicious beating to another senior church figure , Tom De Vocht .
The men described a complex system of internal justice , enforced by security checks and the threat of isolation as a so - called " suppressive person " or SP .
In the interviews the men admitted using violence against other members of the church , often , they claimed , at the behest of Miscavige , also alleging that the church used private information gathered on its members to bully them and force them to do its bidding .
At least some of the recent allegations will be familiar to Jason Beghe , the American actor .
Last year he became the first of its celebrity followers – for whom the church maintains a " Celebrity Centre " – to break with it , after giving Scientology more than $ 1 m in donations over 12 years .
These days
Beghe prefers to warn that the church is " destructive and a rip - off " .
He claims that since his renunciation of Scientology he has been pursued to seminars in Europe – held to speak of its dangers – by private investigators employed by Scientology and " disconnected " from former friends who remain within it .
The decision of Beghe and Haggis to quit Scientology appears to have caused the movement its greatest recent PR difficulties , not least because of its dependence on Hollywood figures as both a source of revenue for its most expensive courses and an advertisement for the religion .
The involvement of such high - profile figures as Haggis , Cruise and John Travolta has acted as a reassurance for potential recruits against the allegations of its critics .
And while Haggis quit the church over its attitude to gay marriage , his lengthy leaked letter of repudiation of Scientology , written to Davis , included another complaint : that he had lied on television about a key Scientology practice .
Haggis said he had been stunned to see a CNN clip of Davis denying that the church practises a policy of " disconnection " by encouraging members to cut ties with non-members who may disapprove of their beliefs .
" I was shocked , " wrote Haggis .
" We all know this policy exists .
I did n't have to search for verification – I did n't have to look any further than my own home . "
He then detailed how his wife was ordered by the church to disconnect from her parents because they were themselves ex-members .
His wife followed the orders and did not speak to her parents for a year and a half .
" That 's not ancient history , Tommy .
It was a year ago …
To see you lie so easily , I am afraid I had to ask myself : what else are you lying about ? "
The answer to that question may now be sought within the context of an Australian parliamentary inquiry .
Notoriously litigious and undoubtedly secretive , Scientology is under the microscope again .
After a bad year for Cruise 's church , things could be about to become a whole lot worse .
History of scientology
Founded by L Ron Hubbard ( 1911 - 1986 ) , a science - fiction novelist who turned to pulp writing after a wartime military career marked by a number of disgraces .
It was while writing for Astounding Science Fiction in 1949 that he published his first article on the subject of dianetics , which would later become Scientology .
It was described by one critic as " a lunatic revision of Freudian psychology " .
His book Dianetics : the Modern Science of Mental Health was published in 1950 .
Attempts to set up dianetics as a therapeutic practice collapsed .
1952 Having failed to present dianetics as an empirically supported scientific system , Hubbard founded a religion called Scientology , which he claimed was the result of years of research .
Using " e- meters " to " measure " the mind , he claimed it could be " cleared " by a process of " auditing " .
At this point based in England , he ran into problems with the authorities .
He founded the Sea Organisation , or the Sea Org , which would become the movement 's central group .
1970 Scientology establishes its celebrity centre in Los Angeles , aiming to attract Hollywood high flyers .
1977 Scientology runs into trouble in the US , this time for domestic espionage against the federal government , for which Hubbard 's wife and a dozen other officials were convicted of conspiracy .
1986 Hubbard dies of a stroke in California .
1993 Scientology is declared tax - exempt as a church in the US , ending a 40 - year battle .
1999 Refused tax - exempt status by the UK charity commission , which rules it is not a religion .
However , in the years that follow it is recognised as a religion in a number of countries , including Sweden , New Zealand and Portugal .
2006 A repeat of a South Park episode that spoofs Tom Cruise and Scientology is pulled from the air .
2009
The church is found guilty of fraud in France .
Screenwriter Paul Haggis splits with Scientology amid accusations of homophobia .
Tom Cruise and John Travolta are still members of the Church of Scientology .

We said that the St Petersburg Times was in Tampa , Florida , which is one of the areas it covers but is not where it is based .
This has been corrected .
I do n't know when global oil supplies will start to decline .
I do know that another resource has already peaked and gone into free fall : the credibility of the body that 's meant to assess them .
Last week two whistleblowers from the International Energy Agency alleged that it has deliberately upgraded its estimate of the world 's oil supplies in order not to frighten the markets .
Three days later , a paper published by researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden showed that the IEA 's forecasts must be wrong , because it assumes a rate of extraction that appears to be impossible .
The agency 's assessment of the state of global oil supplies is beginning to look as reliable as Alan Greenspan 's blandishments about the health of the financial markets .
If the whistleblowers are right , we should be stockpiling ammunition .
If we are taken by surprise , if we have failed to replace oil before the supply peaks then crashes , the global economy is stuffed .
But nothing the whistle - blowers said has scared me as much as the conversation I had last week with a Pembrokeshire farmer .
Wyn Evans , who runs a mixed farm of 170 acres , has been trying to reduce his dependency on fossil fuels since 1977 .
He has installed an anaerobic digester , a wind turbine , solar panels and a ground - sourced heat pump .
He has sought wherever possible to replace diesel with his own electricity .
Instead of using his tractor to spread slurry , he pumps it from the digester on to nearby fields .
He 's replaced his tractor - driven irrigation system with an electric one , and set up a new system for drying hay indoors , which means he has to turn it in the field only once .
Whatever else he does is likely to produce smaller savings .
But these innovations have reduced his use of diesel by only around 25 % .
According to farm scientists at Cornell University , cultivating one hectare of maize in the United States requires 40 litres of petrol and 75 litres of diesel .
The amazing productivity of modern farm labour has been purchased at the cost of a dependency on oil .
Unless farmers can change the way it 's grown , a permanent oil shock would price food out of the mouths of many of the world 's people .
Any responsible government would be asking urgent questions about how long we have got .
Instead , most of them delegate this job to the International Energy Agency .
I 've been bellyaching about the British government 's refusal to make contingency plans for the possibility that oil might peak by 2020 for the past two years , and I 'm beginning to feel like a madman with a sandwich board .
Perhaps I am , but how lucky do you feel ?
The new World Energy Outlook published by the IEA last week expects the global demand for oil to rise from 85 m barrels a day in 2008 to 105 m in 2030 .
Oil production will rise to 103 m barrels , it says , and biofuels will make up the shortfall .
If we want the oil , it will materialise .
The agency does caution that conventional oil is likely to " approach a plateau " towards the end of this period , but there 's no hint of the graver warning that the IEA 's chief economist issued when I interviewed him last year : " We still expect that it will come around 2020 to a plateau … I think time is not on our side here . "
Almost every year the agency has been forced to downgrade its forecast for the daily supply of oil in 2030 : from 123 m barrels in 2004 , to 120 m in 2005 , 116 m in 2007 , 106 m in 2008 and 103 m this year .
But according to one of the whistleblowers , " even today 's number is much higher than can be justified , and the International Energy Agency knows this " .
The Uppsala report , published in the journal Energy Policy , anticipates that maximum global production of all kinds of oil in 2030 will be 76 m barrels per day .
Analysing the IEA 's figures , it finds that to meet its forecasts for supply , the world 's new and undiscovered oilfields would have to be developed at a rate " never before seen in history " .
As many of them are in politically or physically difficult places , and as capital is short , this looks impossible .
Assessing existing fields , the likely rate of discovery and the use of new techniques for extraction , the researchers find that " the peak of world oil production is probably occurring now " .
Are they right ?
Who knows ?
Last month the UK Energy Research Centre published a massive review of all the available evidence on global oil supplies .
It found that the date of peak oil will be determined not by the total size of the global resource but by the rate at which it can be exploited .
New discoveries would have to be implausibly large to make a significant difference : even if a field the size of all the oil reserves ever struck in the US were miraculously discovered , it would delay the date of peaking by only four years .
As global discoveries peaked in the 1960s , a find like this does n't seem very likely .
Regional oil supplies have peaked when about one third of the total resource has been extracted : this is because the rate of production falls as the remaining oil becomes harder to shift when the fields are depleted .
So the assumption in the IEA 's new report , that oil production will hold steady when the global resource has fallen " to around one half by 2030 " looks unsafe .
The UK Energy Research Centre 's review finds that , just to keep oil supply at present levels , " more than two thirds of current crude oil production capacity may need to be replaced by 2030 …
At best , this is likely to prove extremely challenging . "
There is , it says " a significant risk of a peak in conventional oil production before 2020 " .
Unconventional oil wo n't save us : even a crash programme to develop the Canadian tar sands could deliver only 5 m barrels a day by 2030 .
As a report commissioned by the US Department of Energy shows , an emergency programme to replace current energy supplies or equipment to anticipate peak oil would need about 20 years to take effect .
It seems unlikely that we have it .
The world economy is probably knackered , whatever we might do now .
But at least we could save farming .
There are two possible options : either the mass replacement of farm machinery or the development of new farming systems that do n't need much labour or energy .
There are no obvious barriers to the mass production of electric tractors and combine harvesters : the weight of the batteries and an electric vehicle 's low - end torque are both advantages for tractors .
A switch to forest gardening and other forms of permaculture is trickier , especially for producing grain ; but such is the scale of the creeping emergency that we can't afford to rule anything out .
The challenge of feeding seven or eight billion people while oil supplies are falling is stupefying .
It 'll be even greater if governments keep pretending that it is n't going to happen .
Independent artists who sold their music through imeem 's Snocap music storefronts on MySpace and other sites wo n't be paid what 's owed even after MySpace Music 's acquisition of some – but not all – of imeem , Wired.com has learned .
MySpace Music bought " certain assets " from imeem , and they do not include imeem 's liability to more than 110,000 independent artists with Snocap storefronts , according to a source with inside knowledge of the deal .
Those artists ' contracts mandate they be paid each month if they 're owed more than $ 20 .
Some artists have been owed money for more than a year , and the chance of them seeing any money now is , for all intents and purposes , zero , the source says .
Artists attempting to get paid for songs sold through Snocap stores – many or most of which were on MySpace itself – must get in line with imeem 's bank and other creditors .
MySpace Music paid less than $ 1 million for imeem , so it 's doubtful much will remain for the artists .
“ MySpace Music bought a limited set of imeem 's assets including the domain name and certain technology and trademarks , " a MySpace spokeswoman said in an e-mail to Wired.com .
" The asset sale to MySpace Music was part of a foreclosure process which resulted from the lien certain secured creditors had on all the assets of imeem .
MySpace Music did not acquire imeem 's outstanding debts , including the money imeem owed to artists under the Snocap relationship .
Upon closing , users trying to access the Imeem website were redirected to MySpace Music .
We did not acquire imeem 's contracts or relationships as we have our own in place .
MySpace Music has its own distribution platform , which includes relationships with prominent aggregators and indie labels , that provides indie artists ways to monetize their music on our site . "
One source with inside knowledge of the deal said MySpace Music 's rushed purchase of imeem 's assets forced it to " leave behind anything that either had explicit liability or potential liability , " including Snocap and its debts to thousands of independent artists and bands .
Napster creator Shawn Fanning co-founded Snocap in 2002 to let artists sell their music through an embeddable storefront widget .
At one point , the service was marketed as the exclusive way for artists to sell music on MySpace .
Imeem bought Snowcap last summer .
But because MySpace left most aspects of Snocap out of its acquisition of imeem 's assets , all 110,000 or so of those storefronts are gone .
The server that hosts them is offline and so is the Snocap website .
Possibly the last band to be paid by imeem for music sold through a Snocap store embedded on MySpace was Javelin , which happens to be my brother 's and cousin 's band .
After they inquired about money listed as owed in its online account , imeem sent them a check for about $ 400 for approximately a year and a half of sales .
That may not be " a princely sum , " as Tim Quirk put it .
But for growing bands – many of whose income trickles in from a variety of sources – it matters , especially when you consider that imeem 's payments to major labels helped drive it out of business in the first place .
There 's nothing technically wrong with MySpace Music only acquiring certain assets from imeem , and teams of lawyers scrutinized the deal before it was done .
Regardless , in this latest round of digital musical chairs , independent artists who set up music stores in good faith have been left holding the bag .
POST UPDATED 9:25 p.m. : MySpace Music got back to us with a written comment , which we 've included in its entirety .

Reconstruction of the Ocean Sink of Anthropogenic Carbon
Samar Khatiwala Introduction
The global atmospheric concentration of CO 2 has increased dramatically as a result of human activities since 1750 and now far exceeds pre-industrial values .
Indeed , present - day CO 2 levels are higher now than at any time in the past 650,000 years .
The reason we care about this increase of course is because of concerns over climate change .
CO 2 is a greenhouse gas ( GHG ) .
That is , it absorbs outgoing longwave radiation and thus warms the atmosphere .
CO 2 is not the only GHG that is increasing due to human activity , but as the table from the IPCC report shows , its radiative effect is greater than that of all other anthropogenic GHG gases .
Given the importance of CO 2 for climate , a key question is where does this CO 2 come from , and where does it go .
The cartoon below attempts to summarize our current knowledge of the sources and sinks of anthropogenic CO 2 .
There are two principal sources .
The largest is the burning of fossil fuels which emits on the order of 8 PgC/y .
( A petagram ( Pg ) is 1 billion metric tons . )
The second largest , at around 1.5 PgC/y , is changes in land use , primarily deforestation in the tropics to make way for agriculture .
Estimates for this source are relatively very uncertain however .
Together , these two sources contributed somewhere between 370 to 610 PgC between the start of the industrial period ( nominally taken as 1765 ) and 2005 .
So what happened to this CO 2 ?
Less than 50 % of it , or 215 PgC , currently resides in the atmosphere so the balance must have been taken up by the ocean or the terrestrial biosphere .
It is believed that the ocean sequesters 20 to 35 % of manmade CO 2 emissions and thus plays a critical role in mitigating the effects of this perturbation to the climate system .
However , considerable uncertainties remain as to the distribution of anthropogenic CO 2 in the ocean , its rate of uptake over the industrial era , and the relative roles of the ocean and terrestrial biosphere in taking up manmade CO 2 .
To address these questions , I and my colleagues , Francois Primeau at UC Irvine and Tim Hall at NASA GISS , have reconstructed the first spatially - resolved , time - dependent history of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean over the industrial era .
Our work is unique in many ways .
First , it is based solely on observations , and not on numerical ocean models .
Second , it provides the full 3 - dimensional distribution of anthropogenic CO 2 in the ocean at any instant in time between 1765 and the present .
Third , our reconstruction resolves the spatial distribution of the uptake of CO 2 at the surface of the ocean , thus identifying the most intense sinks of anthropogenic CO 2 and their evolution over time .
And last , the inverse method we have developed to perform this reconstruction overcomes many of the fundamental problems and limitations that have plagued previous attempts at solving this problem .
Our reconstruction thus provides the first and most comprehensive view of the ocean sink of manmade carbon and , by combining with the known CO 2 emission history , the terrestrial biosphere sink .
Thus , whereas before we had a single fuzzy snapshot of manmade CO 2 in the ocean , we now have a relatively sharp movie that runs from the start of industrialization to the present .
Estimating Anthropogenic CO 2 in the Ocean
The problem of estimating anthropogenic carbon ( C ant ) in the ocean has challenged scientists for several decades .
To understand why it is so difficult , it is useful to review some basic aspects of the problem .
There are four key points to keep in mind : Anthropogenic carbon is not a directly measurable quantity .
It has to be estimated using indirect means .
The anthropogenic signal in the ocean is only a few percent of the ( unknown ) natural background of dissolved inorganic carbon ( DIC ) .
Carbon in the ocean participates in rather complex in situ biogeochemistry .
biogeochemistry .
Due to long transport time scales , the C ant distribution in the ocean is highly heterogeneous .
Thus , unlike the atmosphere , which is relatively well mixed , and where we have ice core and instrumental data going back many thousands of years , the ocean is much more challenging in this regard .
What we do know about C ant in the ocean is based on so - called " back calculation " methods that attempt to separate the small anthropogenic perturbation from the large background .
The essential idea , which goes back to work by Brewer , Chen , and Millero , is that we can estimate C ant by correcting the measured total inorganic carbon for changes due to biological activity .
The basic equation is shown below , where the first term is the measured DIC , the second is the change in DIC due to soft tissue remineralization and carbonate dissolution , and the third term is the air - sea CO 2 disequilibrium when the water sample was last in contact with the surface .
C ant = DIC meas - biological correction - air - sea disequilibrium correction …
Estimating these terms is a messy business to say the least , and it requires making several critical assumptions :
The stoichiometric or so - called Redfield ratios necessary to account for the biology are known and constant ,
Mixing in the ocean is a negligible component of tracer transport compared with advection ( the so - called " weak mixing " assumption ) , and
The air - sea disequilibrium has remained constant over the industrial era .
How valid are these assumptions ?
As we see below , not very .
However , before we get to that , its useful to see what sort of results can be obtained with traditional inference methods .
The figure below compare the results of applying three different back calculation methods to estimate anthropogenic carbon in the Indian Ocean .
Clearly , while there is some qualitative agreement between them , there are large quantitative differences as well .
In fact , integrated inventories differ on average by 20 % between the different methods .
And many of these methods , including the " ΔC * " method , which is perhaps the best known of all , give negative values of anthropogenic carbon , which points to serious problems .
Lastly , back calculation methods can only provide us with a single snapshot in time .
Considering that only one attempt has been made thus far to apply the ΔC * method globally ( Sabine et al. , 2004 ) , resulting in an estimate for the mid-1990's , this is a perhaps one of the major limitations of this approach .
Assumption I : Redfield ratios are known and constant in space and time
A key assumption made by back calculation methods is that we know what Redfield ratios to use to correct for the biology .
The difficulty with this is that there are in fact large uncertainties in our knowledge of the Redfield ratios and this translates into a correspondingly large error in the inferred C ant .
As an example , the plot below , from Wanninkhof et al. ( 1999 ) , shows the fractional uncertainty in the inferred C ant using the ΔC * method by propagating a typical ( 12 % ) uncertainty in the C:O remineralization ratio .
The error is not small even for large values of C ant .
In the upper ocean , this can easily translate into a 30 - 50 % uncertainty in the inferred C ant .
Assumption II : Ocean transport is dominated by advection
A second implicit but crucial assumption is that ocean transport is largely advective in nature .
This is an implicit assumption because back calculation techniques use transient tracers ( which have a time - varying input into the atmosphere and hence the surface mixed layer of the ocean ) such as CFCs to infer the time it takes for a fluid parcel to go from the surface to the interior .
This works as follows .
If you assume there is no mixing , then the measured interior tracer concentration is related to the surface history of the tracer through a simple time lag .
If you know the surface history you can calculate the time lag .
This is shown schematically in the figure on the left below .
Mathematically , we can write this as :
However , even though it underlies much of chemical oceanography , this simple picture of the ocean is fundamentally incorrect .
The ocean is turbulent and diffusive , and in the presence of mixing there is no unique time scale or pathway that connects the ocean surface to an interior point .
Instead , there is a multiplicity of pathways and associated transit times ( see schematic on right , above ) , that is , a probability distribution of transit times or " transit time distribution " ( TTD ) .
Consequently , the measured tracer concentration is a weighted average of the surface history of the tracer , the appropriate weight being given by a TTD or , more generally , a Green function G , and expressed mathematically as a convolution integral :
You can think of G as a way to partition each water parcel according to when and where it was last in contact with the surface .
A typical example of a TTD or G is shown below .
Note in particular the early peak and long tail that seems characteristic of advective - diffusive transport in the ocean .
Also note that the Green function for purely advective transport would be a delta function centered at the appropriate " transit time " .
There is plenty of evidence for this messier view of the ocean .
As an example , the figure on the left below shows the observed relationship between two different tracers ( CFC - 11 and CFC - 12 ) in the Indian Ocean .
The gray dots represent data while the various curves are attempts at modeling the observed tracer distributions with TTDs ( or G 's ) of different widths .
Evidently , the data are best explained by broad G 's implying strong mixing .
The purely advective case ( red line ) is completely inconsistent with the data , something we find in other ocean basins as well .
The plot on the right shows simulations in a 1 º resolution data - assimilated ocean general circulation model .
( The simulations were performed using the Transport Matrix Method ( TMM ) developed by us , an efficient new technique for performing biogeochemical tracer simulations . )
Here too , we see broad TTDs , a feature that seems independent of model resolution .
Effect of mixing on C ant So how does the neglect of mixing impact estimates of anthropogenic carbon ?
The figure below shows the inferred C ant as a function of measured CFC - 12 concentration for two scenarios .
The first , shown in blue , assumes perfect advection .
The second , shown in red , assumes strong mixing .
You can see that in the upper ocean ( higher CFC concentrations ) the difference between the two is small , i.e. , CFC is a good proxy for C ant .
But at intermediate depths the no-mixing assumption predicts substantially higher values of C ant .
This is because the no-mixing estimate is based on tracer ages which are biased toward younger values .
Since anthropogenic carbon in the surface ocean is increasing over time , this results in a higher estimate of anthropogenic carbon in the interior .
In the deep ocean , the bias is the opposite .
If there is no detectable CFC , we assume that there is no anthropogenic carbon , which really cannot be true in the presence of finite mixing and the fact that anthropogenic carbon has been around for a lot longer than CFCs .
Hence , this leads to an underestimate .
Assumption III : Constant air - sea disequilibrium
The third assumption is that the ocean surface has kept up with increasing levels of atmospheric CO 2 .
This is known as the constant disequilibrium assumption .
Now , there are two main reasons why the ocean is not in equilibrium with the atmosphere .
The first is the fact that it takes a finite amount of time for air - sea exchange of gases .
This is about a month for most gases , but for CO 2 it is about a year because of its buffer chemistry in seawater .
The second reason is ocean circulation which is continuously pumping CO 2 - depleted waters away from the surface at high latitude and bringing up CO 2 enriched water in the tropics .
This is why the subpolar ocean surface is highly undersaturated while the tropics are oversaturated .
The assumption is that this air - sea disequilibrium has remained unchanged over the industrial period .
To evaluate how well this assumption holds , we have performed explicit simulations of anthropogenic carbon in an ocean biogeochemical model .
The top right panel in the figure below shows the preindustrial disequilibrium ( surface ocean p CO 2 minus atmospheric p CO 2 ) in the model .
The bottom panel shows the change in disequilibrium between the preindustrial and 2005 .
It is evident that the changes are quite substantial .
In fact , in the Labrador Sea the disequilibrium changes by ~ 80 % , while in the tropical pacific it changes by ~ 40 % .
Since much of the anthropogenic carbon enters the ocean at high latitude regions such as the Labrador sea , the constant disequilibrium assumption leads to an overestimate ( by almost 20 % ) in the estimated anthropogenic CO 2 .
More fundamentally , as we show below , the uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 by the ocean is in fact driven by the change in disequilibrium .
Thus , assuming constant disequilibrium to estimate C ant uptake is a contradiction .
Estimates of C ant based on ocean models
The discussion above has focused on observational - based methods for estimating C ant in the ocean .
A much simpler approach is to directly simulate anthropogenic CO 2 in coupled carbon cycle - ocean circulation models , an approach taken by a number of recent studies ( e.g. , Mikaloff - Fletcher et al. , 2006 ) .
The problem with this approach , however , is that there is little agreement between different ocean models because they often have rather different physical circulations .
In fact , as seen in the figure below , out of 19 models participating in the OCMIP - 2 study ( Matsumoto et al. , 2003 ) , only two managed to simulate both the Southern Ocean CFC - 11 and anthropogenic CO 2 inventories within the estimated error .
Certainly , over time ocean models will improve and will be essential for predicting future ocean CO 2 uptake .
But first they will need to be evaluated against data - based estimates of C ant , which as the discussion above shows remain highly problematic and limited .
A New Approach to Estimating C ant
To overcome the problems and limitations of traditional methods for estimating anthropogenic CO 2 in the ocean , we have developed an alternative approach .
In many ways it is a much simpler and cleaner approach than back calculation methods because it makes no attempt to separate the small anthropogenic component from the large background .
Our method not only allows us to relax many of the ( incorrect ) assumptions traditionally made , it also uniquely provides us with the time - evolving spatial distribution of anthropogenic carbon over the entire industrial era .
The basic ideas and assumptions are as follows :
The anthropogenic perturbation is sufficiently small for us to treat C ant as a conservative tracer that is transported by the circulation from the surface to the interior .
as a conservative tracer that is transported by the circulation from the surface to the interior .
Ocean transport can be characterized by a Green function .
Ocean circulation is in steady state .
Given these assumptions , we can write the interior anthropogenic carbon concentration as a convolution of the surface history of C ant with the Green function G :
The time integral above is over the industrial era and the space integral is over the ocean surface ( since different regions will in general have different surface histories ) .
To apply this equation , we need two pieces of information : The Green function G , and the surface history of anthropogenic carbon .
Estimating G from tracer observations
Since the Green function G is an intrinsic property of the ocean circulation , and not of any particular tracer , the concentration of any passive conservative tracer satisfies an equation analogous to that for C ant :
We exploit this fact by using a suite of well sampled oceanic tracers such as CFCs , temperature , salinity , radiocarbon , and nutrients , to deconvolve the above equation for G .
To regularize this under - determined problem we use a maximum entropy ( ME ) method .
In practice , to reduce the indeterminancy , we assume that the ocean circulation is in steady state except for a cyclo-stationary seasonal cycle and we discretize the sea surface position variable , x ' , into a discrete set of surface patches .
The ME solution for the i - th patch is then given by :
where M is a prior estimate of G , and α j is the Lagrange multiplier required to enforce the j - th observational constraint .
Substituting the above solution into the convolution integral for each tracer results in a small nonlinear problem whose solution is the α's .
The figure belows shows a particularly successful example of the inversion .
The blue line shows the directly simulated G in an ocean model .
Several tracers were also simulated in the same model and the ME method was applied to these synthetic data .
The red line shows the resulting ME inverse solution .
The prior estimate used is shown by the green line .
Here , for illustrative purposes we have used a uniform prior .
In practice , we use analytical solutions to the 1 - d advection - diffusion equation as priors .
Estimating the surface history of C ant The second piece of information we need is the surface history of C ant .
To estimate this boundary condition , we enforce mass conservation , i.e. , require that the rate of change of the inventory of C ant in the ocean be equal to its net flux into the ocean :
ant is in turn given by :
where k is a gas - transfer coefficient , D represents the air - sea difference , and d represents the anthropogenic perturbation .
This equation shows that the flux is proportional to the change in surface disequilibrium of CO 2 .
To make further progress , we exploit the empirical result from ocean carbon cycle models ( shown below from one such model ) that the change in disequilibrium is to a very good approximation , proportional to the ( known ) anthropogenic perturbation in atmospheric p CO 2 :
e is the ( unknown ) proportionality constant .
2 in sea water , and requiring that our solution match observed p CO 2 values averaged over a discrete set of surface patches allows us to rewrite the mass conservation equation entirely in terms of e .
Discretizing this equation in time and space then results in a nonlinear equation for the discrete set of e i ( one for each surface patch i ) .
We solve it using least - squares .
To summarize , then , our inversion method provides improvements to reduce the main biases of most previous techniques .
In particular ,
The air - sea disequilibrium is allowed to evolve in space and time .
No assumptions are made on biogeochemical processes or parameters such as Redfield ratios .
The mixing of waters of different ages and end - member types is explicitly accounted via a Green function constrained using multiple steady and transient tracers .
Verification of Green function method in an Ocean Model
As a first step , we have applied our approach to synthetic tracer " observations " simulated in a global ocean model .
Tracers simulated include , CFCs , natural 14C , nutrients , and O 2 .
As " truth " , we also simulate anthropogenic carbon .
The figure below shows the column inventory of C ant simulated in the model ( left ) and the error between the ME inverse solution and the " true " simulated solution .
The agreement between the two is remarkably good , with maximum differences of O ( 2 mol / m2 ) in the Southern Ocean .
The total inventory simulated in 1995 in the model is 123.7 PgC , while the inverse method gives an inventory of 125.9 PgC , an error of less than 2 % .
Reconstruction of Anthropogenic CO 2 in the Ocean Having gained confidence in our method from the synthetic inversion , we next applied it to oceanographic data .
Tracers used include gridded fields of CFC - 11 , CFC - 12 , and natural 14C from the GLODAP database ( Key et al. , 2004 ) , and temperature , salinity , oxygen and phosphate from the World Ocean Atlas ( 2005 ) .
Following Broecker et al. ( 1998 ) , oxygen and phosphate are combined into a quasi - conservative tracer known as PO * .
The surface is partitioned into 26 discrete patches based on sea water density .
p CO 2 data required to estimate the C ant surface boundary condition are taken from the Takahashi et al. ( 2009 ) database .
Using our new inverse method on this suite of observations , we have reconstructed the first 3 - dimensional , time - varying , history of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean from 1765 to 2008 .
The figure on the left below shows the column inventory of C ant in 2008 .
The total inventory in that year was ≈ 140±25 PgC .
( The Arctic Ocean and marginal seas are not covered by the GLODAP database .
Using the recent estimate of Tanhua et al. ( 2009 ) for the former , and the area scaling approach advocated by Sabine et al. ( 2004 ) for the latter , would increase our estimate of the global inventory by ~ 11 PgC . )
These are net global estimates , but , uniquely , we can go further .
We can partition the uptake according to where at the surface the anthropogenic CO 2 penetrated the ocean .
As is evident from the right panel in the figure above , the high latitude oceans , driven by intermediate and deep water formation , constitute the most intense sinks of C ant .
( The white lines in the figure delineate the 26 surface patches used for the inversion . )
In particular , the Southern Ocean is by far the largest conduit by which anthropogenic CO 2 enters the ocean : roughly 40 % of the C ant residing in the ocean in 2008 entered the ocean south of 40ºS .
Interestingly , only a small fraction of the CO 2 taken up by the Southern Ocean accumulates in that region .
Much of this CO 2 is transported northward by ocean circulation .
The animation below shows the cumulative uptake ( in PgC ) through each of the 26 surface patches .
The movie runs from 1775 to 2007 .
It is useful to compare our results with previous estimates of C ant in the ocean .
To date , only two global estimates of C ant have been made .
Both are snapshots for 1994 .
Our estimate of the global inventory in that year is 114±22 PgC , which is consistent with both the ΔC * based estimate of 106±21 PgC ( Sabine et al. , 2004 ) , and the TTD - derived estimate of 107 ( 94 - 121 ) PgC ( Waugh et al. , 2006 ) .
However , the previous TTD based estimate incorrectly treated air - sea disequilibrium as constant .
To account for this , Waugh et al. included an ad - hoc 20 % downward correction based on numerical model simulations in their reported result .
Our estimate does not require such a correction because our inverse method explicitly accounts for changing air - sea disequilibrium .
While our estimate for the global inventory also agrees well with the ΔC * based estimate , the spatial distribution we obtain is quite different .
In particular , relative to the ΔC * based estimate , our estimate of C ant is generally lower in the upper ocean and higher in the deep ocean .
The reasons for this can be understood in terms of the various assumptions made by the ΔC * method .
In particular , two fundamental assumptions of the ΔC * are the use of a single tracer age to characterize transport ( effectively assuming that ocean circulation is essentially advective ) and that air - sea disequilibrium has remained constant since the start of the industrial period .
As the discussion above showed , both these assumptions are incorrect , and give rise to competing biases which happen to largely cancel out , leading to the close , but fortuitous , agreement in total inventory estimated using the ΔC * method and our estimate .
So much for the inventory and distribution of C ant .
What about the uptake rate ?
From the time - varying inventory , we can compute the uptake history over the industrial era .
The figure below shows the uptake between 1765 and 2008 .
As is evident , the uptake rate has changed dramatically over time .
In particular , there was a sharp increase in ocean uptake since the 1950's , driven by the higher growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 .
It currently stands at 2.3 PgC/y , i.e. , for every four tons of CO 2 that humans produce , the oceans absorb a bit over a ton .
rate of increase appears to have slowed somewhat even though atmospheric CO 2 levels continue to increase at roughly the same rate .
This seems consistent with recent evidence ( 2 emissions that remain in the atmosphere ) , suggesting that the intensity of both the land biosphere and ocean sinks is declining .
Indeed , we find that between 2000 and 2007 , the fraction of emissions taken up by the ocean has declined by almost 10 % .
Why might this be ?
Since we assume a steady circulation , it can't be due to changes in ocean circulation as suggested by some recent studies based on ocean climate models .
For example , 2 , its capacity to take up more anthropogenic carbon decreases due to the nonlinear nature of the CO 2 chemistry in sea water .
This " buffering " effect is well understood .
In fact , when we linearize the chemistry in our calculations , the aforementioned decline in the rate of increase of uptake reduces substantially .
The second explanation is that the ocean is simply not able to ' keep up ' with the rapid growth in emissions .
There is a physical limit ( due to air - sea gas exchange and ocean circulation ) on how rapidly CO 2 can enter the ocean .
If the emissions grow too quickly , then the ocean can't keep up .
Indeed , we have 2 .
Also shown on the figure above are the IPCC AR4 " consensus " estimates .
( These are decadal averages . )
There is generally good agreement between our estimates ( which cover the entire industrial period ) with the IPCC ones ( which only go back to the 1980's ) .
In particular , our estimate for the present decade is 2.3±0.6 PgC/y , while the IPCC estimate ( which is actually based on an ocean model ) is 2.2±0.4 PgC/y .
Implications for the Role of the Terrestrial Biosphere in Uptake of Anthropogenic CO 2
One of the major uncertainties in our understanding of the anthropogenically - perturbed carbon cycle is the role of the terrestrial biosphere .
Since direct CO 2 flux measurements , especially on a global scale , are at best difficult to make , the terrestrial source / sink term has typically been computed as a difference between the relatively well constrained source of anthropogenic CO 2 due to fossil fuel burning , and the atmospheric and ocean sinks .
The difficulty with this approach is that until now only a single estimate of the inventory of C ant in the ocean has been available ( for 1994 ) .
To get around this , scientists have resorted to using numerical models of ocean CO 2 uptake to quantify the land term .
However , as discussed above , this approach has its own problems , among them being the large errors in simulated transport in current ocean models , and the correspondingly large disagreement in simulated uptake between different models .
Our time - evolving , purely data - based estimate of the ocean uptake allows us to circumvent these problems , and provide a more precise and detailed view of the land sink .
The figure below between shows the time evolution of the main fossil fuel source and the ocean and atmosphere sinks between 1765 and 2005 .
Also shown is the terrestrial biosphere inventory , computed as the difference between the fossil fuel source and the ocean and atmosphere .
Sources are shown as positive values and sinks as negative values .
Fossil fuel data are taken from Marland et al. ( 2007 ) .
As is evident , the terrestrial biosphere was a source of anthropogenic carbon until the 1940's , subsequently turning into a sink .
Cumulatively over the entire industrial period , our best estimate is that the terrestrial biosphere was a net source of C ant .
Propagating uncertainties , we find that the terrestrial biosphere has been anywhere from neutral to a net source of CO 2 , contributing up to half as much C ant as has been taken up by the ocean over the same period .
More recently , however , while the uptake rate has kept on increasing , itsappears to have slowed somewhat even though atmospheric COlevels continue to increase at roughly the same rate .
This seems consistent with recent evidence ( Canadell et al . , 2007 ) for an increase in the airborne fraction ( the proportion of human COemissions that remain in the atmosphere ) , suggesting that the intensity of both the land biosphere and ocean sinks is declining .
Indeed , we find that between 2000 and 2007 , the fraction of emissions taken up by the ocean has declined by almost 10 % .
Why might this be ?
Since we assume a steady circulation , it can't be due to changes in ocean circulation as suggested by some recent studies based on ocean climate models .
For example , Le Quere et al. ( 2007 ) claim that the Southern Ocean sink of manmade carbon is declining - in the model - because of an increase in the strength of the meridional overturning circulation in response to changes in the westerly winds .
This is debatable , however , since there are both empirical and theoretical grounds for suspecting that coarse resolution ocean models - in which eddies are parameterized - do not correctly capture the behavior of the real ocean .
We should also keep in mind that the rate of growth of emissions is increasing .
According to Raupach et al. ( 2007 ) , the growth rate of emissions has increased sharply this decade compared with the previous one .
Between 1990 - 1999 emissions grew by 1.1 % per year , while from 2000 - 2004 they grew by over 3 % a year , almost a 3 - fold increase .
Taking these together , there are two plausible explanations for why the ocean uptake is slowing down relative to emissions .
The first explanation is ocean chemistry .
As the ocean takes up CO , its capacity to take up more anthropogenic carbon decreases due to the nonlinear nature of the COchemistry in sea water .
This " buffering " effect is well understood .
In fact , when we linearize the chemistry in our calculations , the aforementioned decline in the rate of increase of uptake reduces substantially .
The second explanation is that the ocean is simply not able to ' keep up ' with the rapid growth in emissions .
There is a physical limit ( due to air - sea gas exchange and ocean circulation ) on how rapidly COcan enter the ocean .
If the emissions grow too quickly , then the ocean can't keep up .
Indeed , we have shown recently that the airborne fraction is quite sensitive to the emission history and that a 10 % increase in the rate - of - growth of emissions leads to a 3 - 4 % increase in the airborne fraction .
Thus , rather than invoking ' exotic ' mechanisms such as large scale changes in ocean circulation , we believe it is basic physical and chemical factors that are limiting the ocean 's ability to take up fossil fuel COAlso shown on the figure above are the IPCC AR4 " consensus " estimates .
( These are decadal averages . )
There is generally good agreement between our estimates ( which cover the entire industrial period ) with the IPCC ones ( which only go back to the 1980's ) .
In particular , our estimate for the present decade is 2.3±0.6 PgC/y , while the IPCC estimate ( which is actually based on an ocean model ) is 2.2±0.4 PgC / y .
One of the major uncertainties in our understanding of the anthropogenically - perturbed carbon cycle is the role of the terrestrial biosphere .
Since direct COflux measurements , especially on a global scale , are at best difficult to make , the terrestrial source / sink term has typically been computed as a difference between the relatively well constrained source of anthropogenic COdue to fossil fuel burning , and the atmospheric and ocean sinks .
The difficulty with this approach is that until now only a single estimate of the inventory of Cin the ocean has been available ( for 1994 ) .
To get around this , scientists have resorted to using numerical models of ocean COuptake to quantify the land term .
However , as discussed above , this approach has its own problems , among them being the large errors in simulated transport in current ocean models , and the correspondingly large disagreement in simulated uptake between different models .
Our time - evolving , purelyestimate of the ocean uptake allows us to circumvent these problems , and provide a more precise and detailed view of the land sink .
The figure below between shows the time evolution of the main fossil fuel source and the ocean and atmosphere sinks between 1765 and 2005 .
Also shown is the terrestrial biosphere inventory , computed as the difference between the fossil fuel source and the ocean and atmosphere .
Sources are shown as positive values and sinks as negative values .
Fossil fuel data are taken from Marland et al. ( 2007 ) .
As is evident , the terrestrial biosphere was a source of anthropogenic carbon until the 1940's , subsequently turning into a sink .
Cumulatively over the entire industrial period , our best estimate is that the terrestrial biosphere was a net source of C. Propagating uncertainties , we find that the terrestrial biosphere has been anywhere from neutral to a net source of CO , contributing up to half as much Cas has been taken up by the ocean over the same period .
In the discussion above , we only included fossil fuel burning as a source of anthropogenic CO 2 in the computation of the " net terrestrial sink " .
However , another source of C ant is changes in land use , estimates of which , as mentioned previously , remain highly uncertain .
Including this term as a source provides a different perspective on the role of the terrestrial biosphere .
The figure below show the evolution of what is sometimes termed the " residual terrestrial sink " ( computed as above , but including land use changes ( from Houghton , 2008 ) as a source ) .
Note the very large error envelope associated with this curve .
Our best estimate suggests that cumulatively , the terrestrial biosphere currently contains roughly the same amount of anthropogenic CO 2 as the ocean .
However , given the uncertainty , the terrestrial biosphere could be anywhere from neutral to twice as important a sink of anthropogenic CO 2 as the ocean .
Implications for Future CO 2 Uptake and Ocean Chemistry Lastly , we explore the implications of our work for future CO 2 uptake by the ocean .
As discussed above , our results suggest that changes in ocean chemistry ( i.e. , acidification ) may already be limiting the ability of the ocean to take up more manmade CO 2 .
It is therefore useful to explore how continued penetration of CO 2 by the ocean will impact ocean chemistry and thus the role of the ocean as a sink of man made CO 2 .
As a preliminary step , we have used our Green function method to predict future CO 2 uptake in response to projections of atmospheric CO 2 .
As an example , the animation below shows the evolution of the aragonite lysocline depth for 4 different IPCC emission scenarios , starting with the most aggressive ( A1FI ) in the top left corner to the least aggressive ( B2 ) in the bottom right .
The movie runs from 2000 to 2100 .
The lysocline represents the surface above which CaCO 3 is able to precipitate out of seawater ( and form shells ) .
Below this surface , the water is undersaturated with respect to CaCO 3 .
As is evident , by the year 2100 , much of the surface Southern Ocean and large parts of the North Pacific become undersaturated for the A1 FI scenario ( grey shading ) .
Even in the most optimistic case ( B2 ) , we find that many parts of the surface Southern Ocean become undersaturated .
Summary
We have developed a new , purely data - based , inverse method to reconstruct the first 3 - dimensional , time - varying , history of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean over the industrial period ( 1765-2008 ) .
Our approach overcomes many of the fundamental problems and limitations that have hindered previous attempts at solving this problem , and provides the most comprehensive view to date of the ocean sink of manmade carbon .
We find a total inventory of anthropogenic CO 2 in the ocean in 2008 of ≈ 140±25 PgC ( ≈ 150 PgC if we include the Arctic ) , and a corresponding uptake rate of 2.3±0.6 PgC/y .
Thus , the world 's oceans currently absorbs roughly a quarter of manmade carbon .
Our reconstruction quantifies the spatial and temporal distribution of where at the surface this CO 2 enters the ocean , and indicates that roughly 40 % of this CO 2 penetrated via the Southern Ocean .
However , only a small fraction remains in the Southern Ocean , with the bulk of it being transported northward by ocean circulation .
We also find that CO 2 uptake has increased sharply since the 1950's , with a small decline in the rate of increase in the last few decades .
In particular , between 2000 and 2007 , the proportion of emissions absorbed by the ocean has declined by as much as 10 % .
There may be several reasons for this slowdown , but changes in ocean chemistry , compounded by the ocean ’s slow circulation in the face of accelerating emissions , offer plausible explanations .
This is in contrast to other studies , based on climate models , suggesting large scale changes in ocean circulation as a cause for the relative decline in the ocean sink .
Lastly , combining our reconstruction with the known history of anthropogenic emissions , gives us a more precise and detailed view of the terrestrial biosphere sink .
Our results suggest that the terrestrial biosphere was a source of CO 2 until the 1940's , subsequently turning into a sink that has averaged ≈ 1.1 ( 0.4 - 1.8 ) PgC over the past decade .
Cumulatively , the terrestrial biosphere has been anywhere from neutral to a net source of CO 2 , contributing up to half as much CO 2 as has been taken up by the ocean since the start of the industrial period .

The second piece of information we need is the surface history of C .
To estimate this boundary condition , we enforce mass conservation , i.e. , require that the rate of change of the inventory of Cin the ocean be equal to its net flux into the ocean :
The air - sea flux of Cis in turn given by : whereis the ( unknown ) proportionality constant .
Combining the above equations with the equilibrium chemistry for COin sea water , and requiring that our solution match observedCOvalues averaged over a discrete set of surface patches allows us to rewrite the mass conservation equation entirely in terms of .
Discretizing this equation in time and space then results in a nonlinear equation for the discrete set of ( one for each surface patch ) .
We solve it using least - squares .
To summarize , then , our inversion method provides improvements to reduce the main biases of most previous techniques .

Der Zwiebelfisch erklärt , warum das eine so gut wie das andere ist .
The UK borrowed a staggering £ 20.3 bn last month , by far the highest November figure on record .
So far during this financial year , HM Treasury has put another £ 107bn on tick , compared to less than £ 50bn by the same stage in 2008 / 09 .
The grim reality is that Britain is on course to borrow the thick end of £ 200 bn a year for the next three years .

Since Tony
Blair stepped down , he has received millions of pounds from an unusual mixture of income streams .
His financial affairs have been described as ' Byzantine ' and ' opaque ' .
Can you shed any light on them ?

The former prime minister Tony Blair has received millions of pounds through an unusual mixture of commercial , charitable and religious income streams .
Since he stepped down from office in 2007 , his financial affairs have been described by observers as " Byzantine " and " opaque " .
The Guardian is now launching an online competition offering a prize to the person who can shine the brightest light on those financial structures .
Blair has a commercial consultancy , called Tony Blair Associates , plus jobs advising a US bank and a Swiss insurer .
He has a multimillion pound book deal .
He also has a charity , the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative , and another called the Tony Blair Faith Foundation .
But much of the income , which includes charitable donations from other sources , has been funnelled through a structure called Windrush Ventures No 3 Limited Partnership .
Our contest asks : what is Windrush ?
Blair has a complex web of structures involving 12 different legal entities handling the unprecedented millions he is receiving since he stepped down from office in 2007 .
So mystifying are the former prime minister 's financial structures – which involve highly specialised limited partnerships and parallel companies – that the Guardian today launches an open invitation to tax specialists and accountants to attempt to explain the motivation behind such structures .
We have published the Companies House documents and other legal papers regarding the structure of the partnerships at guardian .
co.uk and invite expert comment via our site at guardian.co.uk/politics/series/blair-mystery .
There is no suggestion Blair is doing anything illegal .
But he refuses to explain the purpose of the secretive partnerships .
Tax specialists say Blair could use these unusual arrangements at some point in the future to seek to transfer millions tax - free to his four children .
Blair denies , however , that the structures are such an inheritance tax avoidance scheme , known as a " family limited partnership " .
" Family limited partnerships " were being publicized to lawyers and accountants in November 2007 at the time Blair 's lawyers started to set up his structures .
Known in the trade as " Flips " , family limited partnerships are a way of getting round stricter inheritance tax rules in the 2006 budget , imposed by Gordon Brown while Blair was still prime minister .
Jay Krause , a partner at the law firm Withers , is credited with inventing the Flips concept for use in the UK .
He told the Guardian it is " entirely possible " to use such Blair - style partnership structures legally to avoid inheritance tax .
Instead of setting up trusts , which are now heavily taxed , children can be granted an ongoing interest in the partnership 's wealth , as a " limited partner " .
There are other more conventional uses of such specialised limited partnerships , accountants say .
These include venture capital schemes , private equity investments , or short - term projects such as film finance .
In each of those cases , the so - called limited partner invests cash , but has little control over what is done with it by the general partner .
In return , they are protected from unlimited liability if anything goes wrong .
None of this seems to apply to Tony Blair , however .
No outside " angel " investing cash in Blair Enterprises appears in the records .
The structure is so artificial that in one part of it , Blair is , in effect , forming partnerships with himself .
The former prime minister refuses to offer any explanation of why he is using the complex structures .
As they stand , they were recently described by the Financial Times as " neither tax efficient nor managerially useful " .
Millions of pounds have been funnelled through one arrangement called Windrush Ventures and a second parallel structure called Firerush Ventures .
They may handle some of the large amounts coming in from Blair 's book deal , his six - figure speaking fees , his banking and insurance consultancies , and his pay from Middle Eastern regimes .
The Windrush structure pays for Blair 's £ 560,000 a year lease on his Mayfair office , in Grosvenor Square near the US embassy .
Blair 's profit - making commercial schemes involve 12 different Windrush and Firerush legal entities centring on a pair of " limited partnerships " .
His spokesman , former No 10 staff member Matthew Doyle , refuses to say who Blair 's partner is .
Windrush Ventures
No 3 LP , for example , consists on paper of a partnership between an entity owned by Blair himself and an anonymous off - the - shelf company .
This off - the - shelf company , which appears to have been set up by Alex Harle , Blair 's lawyer at the Westminster solicitors Bircham , Dyson Bell , is merely called BDBCO No 819 Ltd .
Set up as a nominee company to act as a trustee or an executor of a will , this entity does not reveal its ownership on records at Companies House .
Instead , its shares are listed as held by a second off - the - shelf entity , BDBCO No 822 .
This company in turn conceals its true ownership .
Its shares are listed as held by the lawyers , acting as nominees .
This partner company does not appear to have made any significant investments on its own behalf .
The register shows that its sole contribution to the partnership when it was set up in December 2007 was the sum of £ 19 .
The Guardian asked Doyle who owned Blair 's partner company .
We also asked for the terms of the partnership agreement which divides up the rights to Blair 's money .
We asked the purpose of the schemes , and what funds had been paid into them .
Doyle refused to answer .
He even refused to say why the name " Windrush " was chosen .
In a written statement , he said : " Why we set it up ... was in order to allow Mr Blair 's office sensibly to administer his different projects , in accordance with relevant regulations and company law in the UK .
He has an operation that has over 80 people working for it around the world .
This was done on the basis of advice . "
The limited financial information available under company law shows that more than £ 6 m has been passed through the Windrush partnerships , and on to a company owned personally by Blair , called Windrush Ventures Ltd .
The £ 6 m is extracted from the partnership funds by being described as " management fees " going to the general partner – which is a Blair - owned entity .
There is no published record of what other cash or assets remain in the partnership , or how it will be distributed .
The opacity of Blair 's Windrush structures is increased by the fact that they have also been used to handle some charitable donations for projects in Africa .
A Sainsbury family charity , the Gatsby foundation , declares it has paid a total of £ 992,000 to the Windrush limited partnership .
This was for charitable projects in Rwanda , in the two financial years to April 2009 .
The Gates foundation , funded by the founder of Microsoft , declares it paid $ 2.46 m ( £ 1.49 m ) to the Windrush LP in June 2008 , for similar capacity - building projects in Sierra Leone .
Blair this year applied to set up a charity , the Tony Blair Africa Governance initiative , in February 2009 , according to the Charity Commission .
But its application was not accepted until this month , partly because of its novelty and partly through concerns as to whether it was sufficiently separated from Blair 's personal office arrangements .
The link with Blair and his office was " one of the issues we considered ... when looking at public benefit and the independence of the charity , " the Commission said .
BLAIR'S WEALTH
Blair is estimated to be in the process of receiving up to £ 14 m , making him one of Britain 's wealthiest ex-prime ministers .
This includes a £ 4.6 m memoirs deal with Random House .
He is also receiving a series of US fees from the Washington Speakers Bureau for making speeches estimated to include a £ 600,000 signing - on fee ; consultancies with the US bank , JP Morgan and with Swiss insurers Zurich Financial Services ; and commercial consultancy deals through his private firm , Tony Blair Associates , with regimes in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates among others .
The growth in Blair 's personal wealth was illustrated in May 2008 , when he agreed to pay £ 5.75 m for the late actor John Gielgud 's Buckinghamshire residence , described as " a small stately home " .
This was in addition to the £ 4.45 m paid earlier for a London home in Connaught Square , together with an adjoining mews house .
Israeli settler Yaakov
Teitel goes on trial for murder
Police say Mr Teitel has confessed to murder of a Palestinian
The trial of a Jewish settler charged with two murders and a string of other attacks has begun in Jerusalem .
Yaakov Teitel , an American immigrant who lives in the West Bank , faces 14 charges , including two counts of murder and three of attempted murder .
Police called him a " Jewish terrorist " when he was arrested in October .
His lawyer says he is mentally disturbed .
He refused to stand before the court or make statements , saying only " the Lord is king , " Israeli media reported .
Relatives of Mr Teitel 's alleged victims were present in court , Israeli media reported .
" My brother is gone , but Teitel must receive the punishment he deserves .
Such a person should remain in prison all his life , " Hani Balbisi told Israel News .
Police say Mr Teitel has confessed to killing Mr Balbisi 's brother Samir , a Palestinian taxi driver , in 1997 .
' Proud '
As he entered a previous court hearing in November , Mr Teitel said he had no regrets .
" It 's been a pleasure and an honour to serve my God , " he said , " God is proud of what I have done , I have no regrets " .
Police say Mr Teitel , a 37 - year - old and father of four , has confessed to the 1997 murder of a Palestinian taxi driver in East Jerusalem and a shepherd in the West Bank , which he told them were to avenge suicide bombings in Israel .
The charge sheet says some of the attacks were motivated by Mr Teitel 's " hatred and objection " to individuals and groups whose lifestyles and ideology conflicted with his own .
Charges include : Premeditated murder , attempted murder , weapons violations , arson in grave circumstances , incitement to violence and terror and threatening from a motive of hostility against a specific group .
He is also accused of : Placing a bomb near a convent west of Jerusalem , wounding a Palestinian , after previously attempting to set fire to the building
Sending a bomb disguised as a gift for the Jewish holiday of Purim to a family of messianic Jews - Jews who believe in Jesus as a saviour - seriously wounding a 15 - year - old boy
A bomb attack which lightly wounded the left - wing Israeli academic Zeev Sternhell last year
Placing a bomb in a police station in an attempted attack which police say was aimed at diverting them from providing security for gay pride parades
Laying an explosive device next to a Palestinian home near the West Bank settlement of Eli
Putting poisonous antifreeze in three bottles of juice and leaving them near a Palestinian village in the hope of poisoning a passer - by .
He was arrested in Jerusalem after he was found giving out leaflets in the ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood praising an attack on a gay youth club in Tel Aviv in August that killed two people .
A large weapons cache was later found at his home in the West Bank settlement Mr Teitel 's lawyer , Adi Keidar , at the time said his client was " mentally disturbed " and believed he was an " emissary of the Lord " who was instructed to carry out the attacks by God .
He said Mr Teitel had confessed to attacks he did not commit , and therefore his confessions could not be relied on .

London , England ( CNN ) --
You wo n't hear much about it in the vast conference halls of the Copenhagen climate change summit , but living " off- grid " -- beyond the water and power lines that intersect much of the modern world -- could hold a solution to some of the planet 's worst environmental woes .
Initially adopted by hippies and environmental mavericks , the pioneering lifestyle has grown to attract thousands of devotees who choose to live completely independently of the local utilities power grid and instead generate their own electricity and water .
Some begin their off - grid quest out of environmental concerns and some see it as an antidote to rocketing energy prices and fears of economic collapse .
Others simply want to be independent .
Off - grid practitioners generate most of their power from solar panels and wind turbines .
They build rainwater tanks to harvest their water and chop wood to fuel their heating units .
They use only what they can produce but can still live a rewarding lifestyle .
" Things require more care and planning , but it 's pretty easy , it 's not like we 're putting on a hair shirt to live that way , " TV producer and editor of http://www.off-grid.net/
Nick Rosen told CNN .
" And if you 're happy with candles at night and you do n't mind putting on a couple of jerseys when it gets cold , then life is as comfortable as on the grid but at a fraction of the cost . "
In 2008 , Rosen wrote " How To Live Off - grid : Journeys Outside The System , " which chronicles his travels across the UK in a vegetable oil - fueled camper van to meet off - grid practitioners representing all walks of life : from millionaires living in eco-palaces and business professionals in canal boats to backpackers who reside in traditional yurts and rely on torches for illumination .
Although candle lighting may seem like a romantic concept , having to deal with your own sewage or scavenge for firewood to fuel your cooking stove could be a nightmare for most metropolitan dwellers .
Yet , an ever - growing number of communities are choosing to live unplugged .
In December 2006 , USA Today reported that some 180,000 families live off - grid in the U.S. , a figure that has leapt 33 percent a year for a decade , according to Richard Perez , publisher of Home Power magazine .
Exact figures are difficult to be estimated but a further 40,000 people are believed to have gone off - grid in the UK .
One such community is Scoraig , an 80 - strong off - grid settlement located on a secluded peninsula on the north - western coast of Scotland .
The land is owned by Lady Jane Rice , the estranged wife of songwriter Sir Tim Rice , and can only be reached by boat or a five - mile walk through the hills .
" Actually we do n't live so differently from everybody else , " said Hugh Piggott , 57 , who moved to the wind - swept hamlet in 1974 .
Piggott , who has become a world authority on wind power , pays an annual rent of just £ 10 ( $ 16.3 ) .
During his first two years in Scoraig he did n't use any electricity at all .
But now , almost all of the township 's households source their own electricity , water and fuel , getting most of their power from wind turbines and solar panels .
That means that local residents are able to access modern essentials such as the Internet and hot water .
" We have the same sort of facilities as everybody else -- televisions , computers , fridges and washing machines .
The difference is that we 're doing it with renewable energy rather than connecting to the national grid , " Piggott told CNN .
The lifestyle has lately been given an additional boost as several celebrities , including Darryl Hannah , Ed Begley Jr. and Kristin Davis , have endorsed the idea , setting up their own , untethered , solar - powered mansions .
But , unless you have the means to build and house your own lavish off - grid setup -- with a huge oversupply of solar panels and batteries -- opting to live independently of public utility services is not short of struggles .
" The big challenge is to adapt your requirements to the available resources , " said Piggott .
" If there 's a shortage of water you need to change your habits and use less water and if there 's a shortage of wind you need to switch off lights and conserve electricity . "
Another obstacle for off - gridders is securing planning permission to install alternative energy technology .
Rosen found that the situation varies widely across the U.S. and Europe and set up his own off - grid haven in the mountains of Mallorca , Spain .
Located at 700 meters above sea level , his property is equipped with two wood burning stoves and a couple of solar panels .
Rain water is caught and stored in a big stone tank while dozens of candles provide light once night falls .
It is far easier to set up eco-projects in places like southern Spain , where there is an abundance of wind and sunshine .
Landscape gardener Robert Kite moved from London to Cadiz to set up an off - grid home with his partner , Flavia , located away from large urbanizations and close to woodland and the sea .
" It makes you appreciate the earth 's natural resources .
And , of course , on a financial level the benefits include no bills from utility companies for electricity , water and sewage , " Kite told CNN .
The off - grid lifestyle is likely to gain an even bigger following as global warming concerns , soaring energy prices and technological advances in renewable energy are all expected to lead the trend towards eco-living .
Earlier this week , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon told world leaders in Copenhagen that they had the chance to " change the course of history . "
During the summit he called for both industrialized and developing countries to " do more " to reach an agreement on limiting carbon emissions .
Nevertheless , the advocates of off - grid living look at the proceedings in Copenhagen with increasing skepticism .
" We are still being fed the lie that we can somehow keep our lifestyles just like they are -- just tweak them a little bit with some economical use of energy here and some taxes there -- and somehow it can just go on as before , " Rosen said .
" I see people who live off - grid as the foot soldiers of the environmental revolution , the early adopters of what we will all have to do in the very near future . "

GUEST BIO
Paul Stitt : Weighing
In on the ' Super Size ' Phenomenon
The 700 Club
In his Sundance Award - winning documentary " Super Size Me , " filmmaker Morgan Spurlock begins a mission to eat nothing but McDonald 's fast food for 30 days .
He is monitored by three doctors .
His comic quest sends him on an emotional rollercoaster as he gains an injurious 24.5 pounds within those 30 days and his vital signs go off the charts .
How is that possible ?
Paul says that is possible because the American food industry deliberately makes food that does not satisfy .
" It 's hollow food , food that has no substance to it , " he says .
That 's why one feels hungry soon after eating it .
In their processing , the food companies take out the nutrients , and add artificial flavorings and lots of sugar .
They add stimulants that create cravings .
In the film Paul says Morgan eats 5,000 calories per day !
People can eat that many calories per day and still be hungry soon after because the food is specially designed to do that .
That seems to be shortsighted on the part of the industry .
Paul says they think in terms of making as much money as they can today , not thinking about the long - term effects of what they are doing .
Paul knows this subject firsthand because he worked for several major food companies years ago and became alarmed at what he saw as unhealthy food practices .
Scientifically , he knew this was not the best way to process food .
When he voiced his concerns , he was ignored at best , called a crazy radical at worst .
He says they tried to ban him from speaking in the media and on TV , but they could not since there is free speech in America .
He started his own company in 1976 .
" I predicted this epidemic of obesity 25 years ago , " he says .
" Now that there is an epidemic of obesity , many call me now to speak at their conferences . "
TRIED AND TRUE
In his film Morgan crosses the country talking to fast food customers , visiting schools , and interviewing many experts .
Paul says he came to Morgan 's attention when Morgan did a Web search to find a healthy school lunch program .
He found only one , which was the one in Wisconsin 's Appleton School District .
In the movie Morgan shows what happens when things are done right .
This bright spot is the Peak Performance school lunch program created by Paul and his wife , Barbara , which is now in its sixth year .
" I am delighted to be part of Super Size Me , " he says .
" Morgan has humorously depicted in 96 minutes what has taken me 20 years to research . "
Morgan highlighted an Illinois school lunch program where a plate of french fries or a slice of pizza are daily fare - much like the rest of the nation's .
Contrast that to Paul 's program where burgers and soda machines are out and salad bars and energy drinks are in .
After removing every vending machine , the school hired two cooks to prepare meals based on fresh produce , whole grains , and energy drinks .
School officials noted a decided change in the students ' behavior - they are able to better focus in class and they feel better .
" Kids are bombarded with fast food - even in school , " Paul says , " but I 've proven if you give them healthy alternatives , they 'll make the right choice and life - changing results will follow . "
Parents and educators need to accept responsibility for our exploding childhood obesity problem .
" So many kids are suffering because they are obese and unhealthy , " he says .
In 1997 the Stitts underwrote the $ 100,000 five - year program in Appleton 's Central Alternative High School for students identified as at - risk or with discipline problems .
The school district has plans to expand the program to its 25 schools that serve 15,000 students .
VALUE
When asked if eating healthy costs too much , Paul puts this in perspective .
A loaf of whole grain bread averages $ 2.00 per loaf .
Because this bread feeds and satisfies the body , one slice per meal is enough .
Three slices per day ( a loaf and a half ) equals $ 3.00 per week , which totals $ 150 per year .
Whole grain bread provides 50 percent of all the nutrients you need .
Add some turnip greens , apples , bananas , chicken , or fish , and you have a healthy , satisfying meal .
Contrast that to spending at McDonald 's ( per the movie ) $ 27 per day on average - that is $ 9 per meal - and staying hungry .
That totals $ 850 per month .
Paul says fast food gives you the perception of being cheap , but it 's not .
To eat well you have to think ahead and plan .
To enjoy a healthy pot of beans , you have to start them the day before .
This is not high tech , he says , not gourmet , but just fresh fruits , vegetables , and whole grains .
Paul says the Lord put in food all we need to stay healthy .
We have to be wise in eating it .
Paul says he would like to encourage young people to start companies .
Look at the long - term benefits .

ST . PETERSBURG , Florida ( Reuters ) - A neo -Nazi gang member went on trial for murder Monday with his swastika and other tattoos covered by makeup on the order of a Florida judge who thought they could prejudice jurors .
The judge ordered the state to pay for a cosmetologist to apply makeup before trial each day to cover up the tattoos on John Ditullio ’s face and neck , which include a swastika , barbed wire and an obscene word .
Ditullio , 23 , is charged with stabbing to death 17 - year - old Kristofer King in 2006 in New Port Richey , north of St. Petersburg .
His lawyer argued in a pretrial motion that the tattoos , which Ditullio acquired after his arrest , could prejudice a jury .
The judge agreed but ruled that any tattoos Ditullio had before his arrest should not be covered .
Ditullio could face the death penalty if convicted .

From Bloomberg : Morgan Stanley to Give Up 5 San Francisco Towers Bought at Peak ( ht MikeinLongIsland , Brian )
Morgan Stanley ... plans to relinquish five San Francisco office buildings to its lender two years after purchasing them from Blackstone Group LP near the top of the market .
“ This is n’t a default or foreclosure situation , ” [ Alyson Barnes , a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman ] said .
“ We are going to give them the properties to get out of the loan obligation . ”
...
The Morgan Stanley buildings may have lost as much as 50 percent since the purchase ...
It is difficult to study the strategic default decision , because it is de facto an unobservable event .
While we do observe defaults , we cannot observe whether a default is strategic .
Strategic defaulters have all the incentives to disguise themselves as people who cannot afford to pay and so they will appear as non strategic defaulters in all the data .
One of the greatest fears for lenders ( and investors in mortgage backed securities ) is that it will become socially acceptable for upside down middle class Americans to walk away from their homes .
“ Our research showed there is a multiplication effect , where the social pressure not to default is weakened when homeowners live in areas of high frequency of foreclosures or know others who defaulted strategically ”
Note that Morgan Stanley is current on the loan and is not in foreclosure .
They are simply " walking away " because the buildings are worth less than the amount owed .
On residential , the WSJ has an article : Debtor 's Dilemma : Pay the Mortgage or Walk Away ?
( ht Sabine ) .
The article contains a graph of " strategic defaults " by state - however I 'm not sure how this is estimated .
In very few cases does the borrower admit they can afford the payments and are just walking away ( like Morgan Stanley above ) .
In most cases the borrower either does n't respond or says they are having a financial crisis .
From a research paper earlier this year on homeowners with negative equity walking away : Moral and Social Constraints to Strategic Default on Mortgages by Guiso , Sapienza and Zingales .
The researchers argued that the pace of strategic defaults is increasing - and that is terrifying for lenders .
This is what I wrote in 2007 :
And that remains the greatest fear - and it probably does n't help that companies like Morgan Stanley are walking away from commercial buildings .
As the researchers noted , the more people hear about strategic defaults , the more willing they are to walk away .
Zingales was quoted in the WSJ earlier this year : I wonder if hearing about " rich " banks that are paying " large " bonuses walking away from commercial buildings also weakens the social pressure ?

HDR Tutorial – How to Make Beautiful HDR Photos with Ease !
Free HDR Photography Tutorial
I wrote this HDR photography tutorial over 9 years ago and I update it about every few months .
I recently rewrote it from scratch to incorporate all of the new things I ’ve learned and I ’m happy to share them with you here .
Hundreds of thousands of people have used this free tutorial to learn how to make beautiful HDR photos —
I am sure it can teach you too !
Remember , anyone can do this stuff .
All it takes is a tiny bit of curiosity .
You will surprise yourself in no time !
Let ’s get going ! 🙂
Aurora HDR – NO Halos , NO Noise , NEW Looks
Entirely New HDR Algorithm with Artificial Intelligence
How do you follow up from Mac ’s App of the Year in 2018 ?
That ’s a tough one but we put our heads together with the team from Skylum and we ’ve done it !
The latest Aurora HDR uses Skylum ’s new Quantum HDR Engine .
It is a completely redesigned HDR algorithm , paired with artificial intelligence , which took 3 years of development by Skylum ’s AI lab .
My favorite thing about this new version is you no longer need to make corrections on the initial results because it virtually eliminates noise , halos , and other little issues you often needed to fix .
This means you can focus on your creative side .
Begin by trying out the new “ looks ” ( formerly called presets , a few of mine are included for free ) .
And try tweaking out the “ HDR - ness ” of your creation with the new and improved HDR Enhance and Smart Structure sliders .

What is HDR ?
HDR is an acronym for High Dynamic Range .
If you use some special HDR software , you can see all the light in the final photo that you can see when you are standing on the scene .
Perhaps you ’ve been in a beautiful place and taken a photo and it comes out flat and disappointing .
With HDR processing there is no longer a need for that ; now the final image can be as truly evocative as it was when you were there .
The human eye can see so much more than a single shot that your camera takes by itself .
I ’ll show you how you can get these files into this software and make the scene as beautiful as it was when you were actually there .
I ’ll show you how .
Do n’t worry , it ’s easy and super fun !

Sample HDR Photos
Here are a few interesting HDR photographs that people seem to enjoy .
This shows the sort of style I have arrived at over the years by using the techniques described in this tutorial .
You can see many more in my portfolio ; .
Step 1 : Get your box of 128 Crayons ready !
The first step is to get the Aurora HDR Software .
It works on Windows and Mac .
The software has now been through at least 10 iterations and it ’s absolutely amazing .
Do you need a new camera or lens too ?
Most any camera nowadays will do , but I have a bunch of great camera , lens , and goodies recommendations .
Hey , go ahead , get some more stuff ; you know you want it ! 🙂
Some optional things you may want to pick up are Trey ’s Presets / Looks for Aurora HDR and the HDR Video Tutorial with sample files .
Step 2 : Get your photo(s ) ready
Notice I said photo(s ) with an “ s ” because you can use a single photo or multiple photos .
Personally , I use a single photo about 75 % of the time , but I ’ll explain more .
A Single RAW Photo
RAW photos are the format most cameras now use and write them to the memory card .
Note that if you have a new camera , sometimes JPG is turned on by default .
You might have to go into the settings and change it over to RAW .
Single RAW files make a great source for the new Aurora HDR , which is especially tuned for these .
I used to do multiple photos in bracketing ( see next section if you do n’t know what that is ) , but I find a single RAW is sufficient for almost all situations .
Note you CAN use a single JPG in Aurora HDR as well , but a RAW is recommended because it has more light stored inside .
Bracketed Photos
You can also import a series of photos called bracketed photos .
Many cameras have a setting that will let it take a burst of photos at different brightness levels .
So , you would end up with three photos : a dark , medium , and bright photo .
This setting in your camera is typically called Auto - bracketing .
I put my camera in A ( Aperture ) mode , and then the camera will automatically adjust the shutter speeds .
Most of the time , I shoot with the basic exposure settings of - 2 , 0 , and +2 .
I still use bracketed photos when I ’m shooting and there is a big difference in the lighting , from bright to dark .
For example , if I ’m shooting into a very bright sunrise and something quite dark is also in the image .
What should you do ?
Well , I suggest you do shoot bracketed RAW images and then try bringing the middle RAW photo into Aurora HDR and see if that has enough light for you .
If it does n’t , you have the other two brackets ready to go .
Step 3 : Import your photos into Aurora HDR
Okay now the fun starts !
Use Aurora HDR to open your files .
You can also use the Lightroom Plugin if you wish .
Depending on what you import , you have slightly different options :
Importing a single photo
On the opening screen select “ Open Image ” and then you ’ll see the screen below .
There are other options under the gear , but I almost never use them .
They have good explanations inside the tab that opens though .
Importing a set of bracketed photos
After selecting “ Open Image ” and then choosing your three exposures you ’ll see an option for “ Auto Alignment ” – yes , do this .
I do this even when I am using a tripod to get all the shots .
Inside the gear , you ’ll see another good option for “ Ghosts Reduction . ”
If you have movement between your frames in the photo ( like you are shooting horses mating or something ) , then check that box too along with the default options .
Step 4 : Play with the Presets / Looks !
Okay now that you ’re in , you may notice your photo already looks a bit different !
If you click on the eyeball on the top bar , you ’ll see the before / after .
Pretty slick eh ?
Now , we can make more changes to amp it up even more !
First , let ’s talk artistically here .
There ’s no RIGHT and WRONG decisions here , so do n’t be hard on yourself .
You can choose if you want it to be a subtle HDR or a more extreme one .
You may want it cartoony or glowy or desaturated or even more grungy .
Your call !
A great way to get started is with the Presets / Looks .
Open up the presets / looks panel along the bottom and have a gander ( you do this using the button at the top right that looks like three litte squares with a line above them ) .
You ’ll notice there are different categories as well .
Architecture , Landscape , even some from me , Trey !
Once you fall in love with the presets / looks , I hope you will also enjoy buying my additional set– they ’re great !
Here ’s a special note about the presets / looks .
If you hover over them , you ’ll see a slider with 100 .
That means percent .
So if you like the result , but not too much of it , you can slide that back to 50 % or 25 % or whatever you like .
Presets / looks are very powerful and they keep the tool very simple so you do n’t really need to use all those controls on the right that we ’ll get to next .
I know all that can be intimidating to new beginners , so do n’t feel like you need to understand all of them .
Presets / looks are your friends !
Step 5 : Play with my favorite sliders for more powah !
Once you have the panels open on the right ( you ’ll see a toggle above in the top bar to open and close them , just like the presets / looks this time it ’s lines with circles on them ) , you ’ll see there are a TON of sliders .
Do n’t get scared , I ’ll start out by just showing you my 4 or 5 favorite ones .
First , mosey on over to the “ Smart Tone ” slider .
Crank that thing all the way over to the right to see what happens .
Cool eh ?
Then just move it back and forth until you like the look .
This is a new slider and is very powerful … almost AI - level stuff going on behind the scenes .
Second , check out the looks on that “ HDR Clarity ” slider .
This allows you to add a bit of sharpness .
Third , somersault down to the “ HDR Smart Structure ” slider .
This is where you can really AMP IT UP if you so choose .
Again , try moving the slider all the way to the right just to see what it does , then back off .
This whole area can be used to make your photo look as “ HDRish ” as you want .
See that “ Softness ” slider in there ?
That is handy if you do n’t want your edges to be too sharp … sometimes soft is nice .
But , then again , if you want a really hard edge and quite a bit of sharpness , move that Softness slider to the left .
Fourth , head down to frozen food section and find the “ HDR Denoise ” panel .
Often times , when you move the sliders above , the sky can get a little noise .
This will get rid of that lickity McSplitickity .
Wow , imagine if that was really your last name and you ’re stuck talking to customer service in India and they ’re trying to find your customer name .
Fifth , parkour using only one hand down to the “ Image Radiance ” panel .
This area gives it that Fairy Tale Glow I love so much .
Amp up that first Amount slider , then be sure to go down and pull up the Shadows a few sliders down .
Quite a cool effect , eh ?
Step 6 : Discover Layers
Layers allow you to do different things to different parts of the photo .
For example , sometimes I want just part of the photo to have a very strong HDR look .
Other times , I might just want a silky smooth sky .
Let ’s try it .
1 ) Go click on the + in the Layers section and add a new Adjustment Layer .
2 ) Go move one of the HDR Enhance sliders pretty far to the right .
3 ) Go move the Image Radiance Amount Slider pretty far to the right as well as the Shadows down below it
4 ) Now , go up to your new layer and you ’ll see a little brush in the rectangle .
Click it .
5 ) Now start painting by clicking on your photo and dragging around .
She what happened there ?
All your adjustments are just where you are painting .
Note you were painting at 100 % , but you can see that can be lowered in the panel along the top .
This is all called “ Masking ” by the way , but I know that terminology can be confusing to newbies .
That ’s how layers work .
Of course , now you can still go back and make adjustments to all the sliders , and it will only happen where you ’ve painted .
You can make as many layers as you like !
( Optional ) Step 7 : Have fun with all the other panels !
Wow there ’s a lot of panels .
Where do I start ?
Well , my first suggestion is to have you go play with all of them like a kid .
Do n’t worry .
You ’re not going to mess anything up , and it ’s a great way to get to know the tool .
Remember when you try a new slider , be sure to violently move it around so you can see what it does .
Here ’s a few panels that are pretty sweet .
History Panel
This panel is actually on the top bar .
It gives you all your history , except for when girls made fun of you in high school .
You can go back and reverse any decision you made , except for that pesky high school stuff .
HDR Details Boost
You might think this is like the HDR Microstructure , but it ’s not .
Think of it more as very detailed sharpener .
When you use this tool , be sure to zoom into 100 % so you can see the effects .
You wo n’t otherwise .
Top and Bottom Tuning
This area is handy for making different adjustments to the top and bottom of your photo .
Some people like to use this when not using layers .
For example you can make the top part of the image a cooler color and the bottom part warmer .
Dodge and Burn
This is a new area and allows you to selectively brighten and darken different areas of the photo .
The End !

The abrupt merging of Nouveau
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN .

The merge window is normally a bit of a hectic time for subsystem maintainers .
They have two weeks in which to pull together a well - formed tree containing all of the changes destined for the next kernel development cycle .
Occasionally , though , last - minute snags can make the merge window even more busy than usual .
The unexpected merging of the Nouveau driver is the result of one such snag - but it is a story with a happy ending for all .
Dave Airlie probably thought he had enough on his plate when he generated the DRM pull request for 2.6.33 .
This tree contained 203 commits touching 122 different files , and adding over 9,000 lines of code .
One of the key features aimed at the kernel is the new " page flipping ioctl ( ) , " helpfully described in the commit message as " The ioctl takes an fb ID and a ctrc ID and flips the crtc to the given fb at the next vblank . "
In English , it means that a specific video output can be quickly switched from one region of video memory to another , allowing for clean video changes without the " tearing " that results from display of a video buffer which is being changed .
Other changes for DRM this time around include support for Intel 's " Ironlake " GPU and " Pineview " Atom processor , and a great deal of work supporting kernel mode setting on Radeon GPUs .
Radeon , it seems , only lacks good power management support at this point ; it will likely lose its " staging " designation before the end of this development cycle .
Linus was not impressed by any of that , though .
Instead , he had one concern : the fact that the Nouveau driver - a reverse - engineered driver for NVIDIA chipsets - was not a part of the pull request .
Nouveau had been discussed at the 2009 Kernel Summit , and it was generally agreed that this code should find its way into the mainline as soon as possible .
2.6.33 is the first merge window since the summit , and Linus clearly had expected some action on that front .
When he did n't get it , he made his disappointment known .
One might wonder what the problem with Nouveau was .
The world is full of out - of - tree Linux drivers ; recent efforts have reduced their number considerably , but they still exist and Linus does not normally complain about them .
Certainly Nouveau has a higher profile than most other out - of - tree drivers ; it is the only hope for a free driver for a large percentage of available machines .
But the real problem is that Fedora ( at least ) has been shipping this driver without doing enough ( in Linus 's opinion ) to get it upstream .
In Linus 's words :
I 'm pissed off at distribution people .
For years now , distributions have talked about " upstream first " , because of the disaster and fragmentation that was Linux - 2.4 .
And most of them do it , and have been fairly good about it .
But not only is Fedora not following the rules , I know that Fedora people are actively making excuses about not following the rules .
I know Red Hat actually employs ( full - time or part - time I have no idea ) some Nouveau developer , and by that point Red Hat should also man up and admit that they need to make " merge upstream " be a priority for them .
A number of reasons for the non-merging of Nouveau have been given , ranging from " not ready yet " and " unstable user - space API " to " we have n't found the time yet . "
The real blocker in recent times , though , has been the binary blob loaded into some NVIDIA GPUs by the driver .
This chunk of code , known as the " voodoo " or " ctxprogs , " was obtained by watching the proprietary drivers in action .
Since nobody in the Nouveau project wrote this code , nobody has been willing to sign off on it ; it 's not at all clear that it can be legally distributed .
Linus has not been impressed by this reason either , but the fact remains : developers take the Signed - off - by : line seriously and are not willing to attach it to something which might be legally questionable .
The obvious answer , one which has been applied in other situations , is to pull the firmware out of the driver and load it into the kernel at run time .
And that is exactly what happened with Nouveau : Ben Skeggs put in an intensive effort to remove ctxprogs and use the firmware loading API to get it when the driver loads .
Dave then put together the " DRM Nouveau pony tree " and requested that it be pulled for 2.6.33 .
Linus , of course , did exactly that .
Potential users will still have to get the " ctxprogs " from elsewhere .
For whatever reason , pointers to " elsewhere " are hard to find , but your editor happens to know that the firmware can be found in the Nouveau git tree .
Simply grabbing the right version and placing it in the local firmware directory should be sufficient .
All of this marks significant progress for Nouveau , but a dependence on firmware of dubious origin is likely to inhibit the adoption of this driver in the long term .
So it was good to learn ( via an LWN comment posting ) that the contents of the ctxprogs blob are not quite as obscure as many of us had thought :
[ W]e know a lot about ctxprogs these days , including their purpose [ context switching ] , what they do [ save / restore PGRAPH state ] , and most of their opcodes .
There are still some unknowns that prevent us from writing new ctxprogs from scratch right now , but we 're working on that and it * will * be resolved in the proper way .
Which is throwing out nvidia 's progs and writing our own prog generator .
It seems that things are moving quickly on this front too ; on December 15 , Ben announced the availability of a replacement firmware for NVIDIA GeForce 6/7 hardware .
This is a first posting for this code ; doubtless testers will encounter some problems .
But it sounds very much like the hardest problems have been overcome , at least for this particular variant of the hardware .
With luck , NVIDIA 's firmware will not be needed for much longer .
In the longer term , it might even turn out to be possible to program interesting functions into the hardware , extending its capabilities in surprising ways .
Once upon a time , Linux users had to be very careful about which hardware they bought .
Over the years , most of those problems have gone away ; it is now easy to find systems which are completely supported by free software .
One of the biggest exceptions has been in the area of graphics .
Vendors like Intel and ATI / AMD have made the decision that their hardware should be supported with free drivers ( most of the time ) and have invested resources to make that happen .
NVIDIA has been rather less cooperative , and support for its hardware has suffered accordingly .
It would appear that the driver problem is getting close to a solution , but we should never forget the effort which was required to get to this point .
NVIDIA would be far more worthy of our future commercial support if it had not made that effort necessary .
What Teabagger Signs Say Vs. What They Mean
For those who have a hard time reading between the lines , here 's a list of what Teabagger signs say followed by what they really mean .
It 's 25 years since the world 's worst industrial disaster struck Bhopal , a town in central India .
On 3 December 1984 , a toxic leak in Union Carbide Corporation 's factory unleashed 40 tonnes of lethal gas into the sleeping town .
It killed 3,500 people instantly and an estimated 20,000 have died from complications since .
According to activists , the actual figures are much higher .
The compensation paid by Union Carbide to the Indian government was laughably low : nowhere near enough to pay for the actual numbers of people affected by the gas spill .
For victims , getting the money from the government proved a Sisyphean task .
For those who did manage to obtain compensation , the measly amount quickly ran out in the wake of new or persistent medical complications , hospital bills , and economic problems compounded by disabilities .
Many have still not been paid .
Worse , the factory remains a contaminated site , its ruins full of toxic waste , its soil rife with mercury , lead , nickel and other metals , its secretions polluting water for miles around .
And nobody wants to clean it up .
Dow Chemical , which bought Union Carbide eight years ago , denies culpability and the state is eager to prove that the factory site is no longer harmful .
As the novelist Indra Sinha has pointed out , Dow and the State are cosy colluders in this sordid saga .
Meanwhile , the people of Bhopal are still suffering the effects : skin disease , deformed babies , contamination of soil , plants and animals .
Earlier this month , in a bizarre form of disaster tourism , the government of Madhya Pradesh ( the state in which Bhopal lies ) announced they would commemorate the 25th anniversary by opening the factory gates for two weeks , in an effort to show the site is safe .
They wanted to display " that the 350 metric tonne waste lying in the factory is not at all harmful , " as Babulal Gaur , minister for Bhopal gas tragedy relief and rehabilitation , told newspapers recently .
People closer to the ground – and the truth – were outraged .
For a quarter of a century , the people of Bhopal have been fighting to get what is their due : adequate medical care , compensation , employment opportunities and a clean environment .
They have had to protest , stage demonstrations , cry and wait .
Outside courts , outside government buildings , outside ministerial residences and Dow Chemical offices .
Twenty - five years is a long time to be stuck in the one horrible moment when life turned itself inside out .
The government 's latest attempt to deny the truth is not entirely unexpected but it does sink to new levels of subhuman behaviour .
It 's small relief that they have not acted out the absurd plan yet .
On 3 December , there will be memorial functions across our capital – lots of singing , candle - lighting , swaying with hands on hearts and so on .
Then it 'll be business as usual for most .
For the people of Bhopal , though , the battle will have to go on .
The least we can do is remember , and extend our support to them .
Countries that have not broken so cleanly from communist ideology , however , are in decay - serving as an indictment of top - down state control .
Russia , once the power nucleus of the USSR , has been slower than many of its former satellite countries to embrace capitalism and political reform .
Its elections have been widely regarded as rigged .
And the 2009 Freedom House Map of Freedom notes that property rights are precarious and the rule of law is too frequently subjugated to politics .
In the 1930s and 1940s , decades after steam engines had made wind power obsolete , Dutch researchers obstinately kept improving the – already very sophisticated – traditional windmill .
The results were spectacular , and there is no doubt that today an army of ecogeeks could improve them even further .
Would it make sense to revive the industrial windmill and again convert kinetic energy directly into mechanical energy ?
This is a guest post by Kris De Decker .
It was previously published by Low - tech Magazine ( a very interesting web magazine ) and by Energy Bulletin .
More than 900 years ago , medieval Europe became the first large civilisation not to be run by human muscle power .
Thousands and thousands of windmills and waterwheels , backed up by animal power , transformed industry and society radically .
It was an industrial revolution entirely powered by renewable energy – something that we can ( and do ) only dream of today .
Wind and water powered mills were in essence the first real factories in human history .
They consisted of a building , a power source , machinery and employees , and out of them came a product .
Fig. 2
Windmills and waterwheels were not new technologies – both machines appeared already in Antiquity and the ones used in the early Middle Ages were technically no different from those .
However , ancient civilisations like the Greeks and the Romans hardly used them , possibly because of religious reasons and because of a large enough reservoir of human slave labour .
Water versus wind
Water powered mills were – overall – more important and numerous than windmills .
This is logical since they are a simpler and more reliable technology ; the flow of a river might change according to the seasons , but generally a river always contains water .
Moreover , by making use of canals and sluice gates the flow of water could be precisely controlled to provide the speed or load required by the gearwork inside the factory .
The wind , on the other hand , does not always blow .
When it does , wind velocity and direction can change at any moment and windmills had no efficient method to control the strength of the wind – at least not in early medieval times .
Water powered mills appeared in Europe in large amounts from the end of the 11th century onwards and only 200 years later almost all available energy in rivers and streams was put to use .
However , not all regions were suited for watermills .
The reasons could be that they did not have sufficient water resources ( like Spain ) , that they were too flat and their rivers did not have enough flow ( like the Netherlands and the downlands of England ) or that rivers generally froze during winter ( like in Scandinavia , Russia and parts of Germany ) .
In these countries , windmills appeared in the 13th century , possibly earlier , and spread fast .
Later , also regions that had abundant water resources constructed windmills , to relieve the pressure on rivers and streams .
How many windmills ?
Fig. 3
The amount of windmills in early medieval times remains unknown , because the few inventories that could be studied do not distinguish between water and wind powered mills .
For instance , we know that there were between 10,000 and 12,000 mills in the UK in 1300 , but we do not know how many of them were wind powered ( it must have been a minority ) .
All we have are data on individual windmills , which start to appear at the end of the 1200s .
Only in the 1700s and 1800s , when windmill technology really caught on , more accurate inventories appear .
In 1750 , there were 6,000 to 8,000 windmills in the Netherlands , in 1850 there were 9,000 of them .
For comparison , this is almost 5 times as much as there are wind turbines in the Netherlands today ( 1,974 turbines as of September 2009 ) .
In the UK there were 5,000 to 10,000 windmills in 1820 .
France had 8,700 windmills ( and 37,000 watermills ) in 1847 .
Fig. 4
Germany had 18,242 windmills in 1895 ( compared to around 18,000 wind turbines today ) and Finland had 20,000 windmills in 1900 .
Portugal , Spain , several Mediterranean islands and many Eastern European and Scandinavian countries had many windmills , too .
The total amount of wind powered mills in Europe was estimated to be around 200,000 ( at its peak ) , compared to some 500,000 waterwheels .
Windmills were built in the countryside and in cities , and even on the walls of castles and fortifications in order to catch more wind .
Initially , the only applications of windmills were the grinding of grain and ( to a lesser extent ) the pumping of water and the draining of lowland areas ( for which they were connected to a waterwheel working in reverse – the scoopwheel - or to an Archimedean screw ) .
Around 1600 , many new industrial applications of windmills appeared : saw mills , paper mills , mustard mills , tobacco mills , ...
Fig. 5
Bread and oats were the staple diet of the Middle Ages ( meat , fish and vegetables were only available to the rich ) and all that grain had to be crushed or ground .
It took one person with a hand mill two hours a day to grind enough flour for an average family .
Corn windmills were also used to make Dutch gin and other liquors .
The grinding of grain remained the most important use of windmills - as late as 1900 , the entire wheat harvest of Northern Europe was ground by windmills in the Netherlands , Denmark and Germany .
However , around 1600 many new applications of windmills appeared .
New applications
Windmills were used for hulling barley and rice , grinding malt , pressing olives to olive oil , and pressing coleseed , linseed , rapeseed and hempseed for cooking and lighting .
There were also cocoa mills , mustard mills and pepper mills ( also used for other spices ) , even tobacco mills and snuff mills .
Besides food production , two other major applications of windmill technology were the production of paper ( using ropes and sails from ships as a raw material ) and the sawing of wood .
Windmills were also crushing chalk ( to make cement ) , grinding mortar , draining mines , ventilating mineshafts ( and even a prison ) , polishing glass and making gunpowder .
Textiles were another industry in which wind power came to the rescue : windmills were crushing seeds from flax ( to make linen ) , preparing hemp fibres ( to produce ropes and sailcloth ) , fulling cloth ( to create soft wool ) , making paint and tanning and dying animal skins .
The Zaan district
One of the most spectacular developments of industrial wind power technology occurred in the Zaan district , a region situated just above Amsterdam in the Netherlands .
Although the area is surrounded by water , the potential of water power was limited because the land is as flat as it can be and so the flow of the rivers is low .
The wind , on the other hand , is strong .
Many of the applications of windmills described above appeared first ( and sometimes only ) in the Zaan district .
Fig. 6
It is said that the region was the world ’s first industrialized area .
From 1600 to 1750 , when the Netherlands became an important economical power , around 1,000 windmills were built and operated here ( see Fig. 6 ) .
Mills were given names , just like ships .
A vital element of the wind powered industry in the Zaan district was the saw mill .
Wood was required to construct houses , sluices , ships and of course more windmills .
Hand sawing was a very laborious task and windmills greatly reduced the time needed for the process .
With hand sawing , 60 beams or trunks would take 120 working days , with wind power this only took 4 to 5 days ( see Fig. 7 , more here ) .
The first sawmill ( " Het juffertje " or " The missy " ) was built in the town of Zaandam by Cornelis Corneliszoon in 1596 .
By 1630 , there were 83 sawmills north of Amsterdam , of which 53 were located in the Zaan district .
The peak was reached in 1731 when there were 450 sawmills in the Netherlands , 256 of them in the Zaan district .
Eventually even the crane of these mills , to haul up the timber , was driven by the sails .
Another early industrial application of wind power in the Zaan district was the production of paper – this was , after all , the era in which the printing press appeared .
The first papermaking windmill ( " De Gans " or " The Goose " ) dates from 1605 and by 1740 there were 40 of them .
In the middle of the 17th century , the Dutch paper mill was substantially improved , which enabled it to make whiter paper and make it faster .
Fig. 7
One remaining example is “ De Schoolmeester ” ( " The Teacher " ) , built in 1692 ( see the introductory picture [ Fig. 8 ] and the interior below ) .
Wind powered paper mills were rare in other countries , but water powered versions already appeared in the 11th century and became quite common – in England there were 417 of them in 1800 .
In saw mills , even the crane to haul up the timber was driven by the sails .
Other remarkable windmills in the Zaan district were snuff and tobacco mills ( 38 in 1795 ) , oil mills ( 140 in 1731 ) , barley hulling mills ( 65 in 1731 ) , dyestuff mills ( 21 in 1731 ) and hemp mills ( 20 in 1731 ) .
The Dutch also built hundreds of windmills in the West Indies for crushing sugar cane .
Relatively few of the 1,000 surviving windmills in the Netherlands are industrial windmills - drainage and corn mills remained economically viable much longer .
Fig. 8
Backup power : animals
In many other European countries , similar functions were mainly performed by watermills .
However , not all activities powered by waterwheels could be powered by sails .
The fickleness of the wind made windmills unsuited for processes that required a very steady and reliable power output , like metal making , spinning , tool - sharpening or extracting minerals from mines .
In countries where the potential of water power was insufficient , some of these activities were powered by animals , mainly horses .
Horses were also used as a backup power in long periods of calm , in order to guarantee delivery .
For instance , in the Netherlands in 1850 , there were 1,800 windmills for the grinding of corn , but also 1,300 horsemills for the grinding of buckwheat – a grain that required a more steady power source for grinding .
Post mills and tower mills
Early medieval windmills were simple machines , derived from waterwheels .
During the following centuries , however , windmills became a very sophisticated technology .
Windmills are much more complicated machines than waterwheels because wind velocity and speed change continually .
Earlier windmills in Iran and Afghanistan were of the horizontal ( vertical - axis ) type , and thus did not have to adapt to changes in wind direction .
But these machines , which were much less efficient , were never used in Europe .
Fig. 9
Initially , medieval millwrights solved the problem of varying wind direction by positioning the whole mill on a central spindle so that it could be turned to face the wind .
This was the so - called “ post mill ” ( see Fig. 9 ) .
Around the 1400s , a second type of windmill appeared , in which only the cap and sails rotated and the body of the mill remained stationary .
This was the so - called “ tower mill ” , which was later perfected by the Dutch ( see Fig. 10 ) .
Fig. 10
Tower mills were also the dominant type around the Mediterranean , but these were less efficient machines with very different sails .
Because it was stationary , the main body of a tower mill could be constructed from stone or brick , and thus they were more sturdily built .
Both types continued to be in use , but many post mills were replaced by tower mills from the 1600s to the 1800s .
Turning the sails into the wind
Fig. 11
These days , wind turbines are turned into the wind automatically by means of electronic equipment .
When the wind becomes too strong , the electronics turn the blades out of the wind so they are not blown to smithereens .
Medieval millwrights had no microchips and so they had to find another solution .
For many centuries , windmills were turned into the wind by mere muscle power .
This was done by lifting a large tailpole at the back of the mill ( hooked up to the tail ladder in the case of a post mill ) , moving it to the required position , and fixing it again at one of the twelve anchor posts sunk into the ground in a circle around the mill .
This was not an easy task , because the body of a post mill had to be turned with the weight of all the machinery inside .
Some mills were equipped with a winch at the end of the tailpole , riding on a circular track , which made the task a bit easier .
The cap of tower mills was turned in a similar fashion , by means of a much longer tailpole - reaching to the ground ( Fig. 11 ) or to the terrace in the case of a tower mill with a stage ( here ) .
Vent holes were drilled in the sides of the body of the mill – when the wind started blowing through one of these holes , the miller knew that wind direction had changed .
Adjusting the sails : a daunting task
Adapting to variations in wind velocity was even more challenging .
The factory machinery inside the mill required a rather precise operating speed .
For instance , corn mills worked best at 50 to 60 sail revolutions per minute .
Once surpassing 80 sail revolutions per minute the grain would burn .
Another risk was that when sails started turning too fast , the windmill could be destroyed .
Fig. 12
Again , for centuries , the miller had to do this by hand .
Basically , there were two ways to adjust to changing wind speeds .
Minor differences in wind velocity could be absorbed inside the mill , by increasing or decreasing the load .
For instance , in a corn mill , adapting to a higher wind speed could be done by widening the gap between the milling stones and adding more grain .
Because the load is increased , the amount of revolutions of the sails remains more or less the same in spite of the higher wind speed .
When the changes in wind speed became too large , however , the miller had no choice but to get out of the mill and adjust the sails .
Traditional windmills were not equipped with blades , but with sails – mostly a wooden framework covered with canvas ( in colder climates the canvas was generally replaced by slats of wood , which were easier to handle in freezing conditions ) .
Reefing two or even four sails , or reducing sail area were very effective methods to adjust to higher wind speeds , but these must have been daunting tasks in high winds .
At least two sails had to be brought within a vertical position and stopped so that the miller , climbing the sail , could take off the cloth .
If the brake failed while the miller was in the sail , he would be in for a spectacular ride .
Tying and reefing all four sails was also a standard procedure at the beginning and end of each working day .
During the second half of the eighteenth century , several complex but effective techniques were developed that made it possible for a traditional windmill to be left mostly unattended
During the second half of the eighteenth century , several complex but effective techniques were developed that made it possible for a traditional wind mill to be left mostly unattended , at least when it concerned changes in wind speed and direction .
In 1745 , the English blacksmith Edmund Lee invented the " self - regulating wind machine " or " winding " , a device that automatically adapted the positioning of the windmill to the direction of the wind .
It consisted of a fantail ( two fantails for larger windmills ) and a gearwork ( Fig. 13 ) .
Fig. 13
A fantail can be described as an auxiliary windmill that is mounted behind the main sails , at a right angle to them .
If the direction of the wind changes , it hits the fantail , turning the mill until the main sails are again perpendicular to the wind .
Fig. 14
The fantail is geared down to a travelling wheel in the cap of the tower ( in case of a tower mill , above ) or around the building ( in case of a post mill , see picture ) .
Fantails were later used for wind - powered water pumps in the US , but because these machines were much lighter there was no need for a gearwork to turn them .
The winding not only made the handling of the mill much easier , it also augmented the power output .
A substantial amount of power can get lost because of slight variations in the wind direction , but the miller did not always have the time ( or the will ) to turn the windmill following every minor change .
Automatic control : spring and patent sails
Fig. 15
Around the same time as the fantail and winding were invented , mechanisms started to appear that were aimed at automatically adapting the sails to varying wind speeds .
This led to the development of the so - called “ spring - sail ” in 1772 , invented by Scottish millwright Andrew Meikle .
On a spring sail , the sailcloth is replaced by dozens of shutters like those of a Venetian blind .
Each shutter is controlled by a spring .
Fig. 16
As the wind increases , it overcomes the force of the spring and the shutter will open , letting the wind through and slowing down the sails .
The stronger the wind , the more the shutters will open .
When the wind speed decreases , the shutters will be closed by the spring , again forming one uninterrupted surface .
All of this results in having sails with a similar rotation speed at any wind velocity .
The problem with spring - sails is that the tensions of the springs ( which are all connected to each other by means of a long pole ) have to be adjusted beforehand depending on the expected wind speed and the power needed .
Once set , it is impossible to make adjustments while the sails are turning .
Fig. 17
This was solved in 1789 by Stephen Hooper , who introduced blinds that could be adjusted with a manual chain from the ground without stopping the mill ( " roller reefing sails " , Figure 17 ) .
However , the system was too complicated .
The final improvement to self - reefing sails came in 1807 when William Cubit attached counterweights to the adjustment chain of spring sails , making the control of the sails fully automatic without the complexity of the roller reefing method – these were called “ patent sails ” ( Fig. 15 ) .
Berton sails
The only problem left was that patent sails had a lower efficiency than normal sails , and as a result it was common to combine two patent sails with two normal sails as a compromise between handling and efficiency .
In 1848 , the Frenchman Berton replaced the many small shutters by fewer longitudinal shutters operating according to the same principle , an intriguing method that gave a sturdier construction and a better aerodynamic performance ( " Berton Sails " , see Fig. 18 ) .
Moreover , the system could be adjusted by the miller from inside the cap of the mill .
In 1860 , Catchpole introduced air brakes , which were a very effective means to automatically slowing down the sails in a gale .
Inside the mill , an automatic centrifugal governor replaced the manual adapting of the distance between the milling stones .
Of course , self - reefing sails and other automatic systems did not solve the problem of windless days - that is why the miller worked day and night when there was a good breeze .
Millers were even exempt from Sunday 's rest .
Fig. 18
As was the case with the fantail , self - reefing sails did not only improve the handling of the windmill , but also the power output .
Because there was no longer a need for the miller to stand on the ground to fix or unfurl the sails , the wind shaft could be installed much higher so that the mill could benefit from higher wind speeds ( the Dutch had solved this issue before by constructing tower mills where the sails could be reefed from a stage at a higher level ) .
Power output of a windmill
Another important improvement was the introduction of cast iron for the manufacture of the gearwork .
This happened in 1755 , only ten years after the introduction of the winding , by John Smeaton .
For centuries , all gears inside the mill were made of wood .
This resulted in serious energy losses .
Measurements performed by the Dutch in the 1930s , on a drainage windmill constructed in 1648 , showed that the mill generated around 40 horsepower at the windshaft but only 15.6 horsepower at the machines – an efficiency of only 39 percent .
Almost two thirds of the generated power was lost in the transmission .
Drainage mills had a slightly higher efficiency of around 50 percent .
Windmills with wood gearings had an efficiency of only 39 percent
Fig. 19
The use of cast - iron ( and later iron ) did not only improve the efficiency of the gearwork , but also allowed for the construction of larger windmills .
The use of wood limited the diameter of the sails to around 30 meters – already common in the 1600s .
The maximum length of a stock ( more than twice the length of one sail ) was around 30 metres ( 100 feet ) because there were no larger trunks available .
Only in the second half of the nineteenth century iron stocks came to be used for the sails and for the windshaft .
Innovations came too late
Unfortunately , the many important improvements of windmill technology came too late .
Already at the end of the 1700s , around the same time that these innovations appeared , the first corn mill switched from wind power to steam power – and to the black smoke that came with it .
Around 1850 , steam powered mills became more common and the importance of windmills started to decline .
To make things worse , fantails , self - reefing sails and iron stiffening were slow to catch on - in many countries and regions they were never even used .
Fig. 20
Berton sails were only applied in France , patent sails were mainly used in England .
Although iron stocks allowed for the construction of larger sails , that never happened .
The highest tower mill ever constructed was made entirely out of wood .
It was standing in the Netherlands and was constructed in 1899 ( " De Hoop " or " The Hope " in Prinsenhagen , now the city of Breda ) .
It stood 38 metres ( 125 ft ) tall , with sails around 27 metres ( 88.5 ft ) in diameter .
The cap and sails were removed in 1929 but the tower is still there .
Largest windmill ever built
The two Dutch windmills with the largest sail diameter are standing in the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco , built between 1903 and 1905 .
The largest one , the " Murphy Windmill " , stands 29 metres ( 95 ft ) tall with sails 35 metres ( 114 ft ) across .
The stocks were cut from one single log - the US had larger trees .
But its gearwork is made entirely of cast iron and that shows : the mill pumped up to 150,000 litres ( 40,000 gallons ) of water per day to irrigate the park .
The Murphy Mill was replaced by an electrical engine some years later and fell into disrepair .
The decline of the windmill was slow , especially in the Netherlands - the Dutch even preferred windmills with auxiliary steam engines over fully steam powered mills .
More than 6 million wind powered waterpumps ( with annular sails ) would be built in the United States between the 1850s and the 1930s , but elsewhere few windmills were erected after 1900 .
The attention shifted to wind turbines generating electricity , and that has remained so ever since .
Impressive improvements in the 1920s and 1930s
In the 1920s and 1930s , however , when windmills had stopped working almost everywhere in Europe , the Dutch started a research program that led to the final development of the classical windmill .
In 1923 , the “ Dutch Windmill Society ” was founded , with the mission to improve the performance of windmills generating mechanical energy .
Among the members were famous millwright builders like the Dekker Brothers .
The results were spectacular .
The maximum power output of a windmill was doubled from 50 to 100 horsepower at the end of the 1920s .
Through the application of aeronautical principles and the use of sheet metal ( basically equipping traditional windmills with sails somewhat similar to the blades of modern wind turbines ) the maximum power output of a windmill was doubled from 50 to 100 horsepower at the end of the 1920s .
Fig. 21
More than 70 windmills were equipped with the new " Dekkerized sails " during the following decade .
Moreover , improvements in the gearwork slashed energy losses and allowed for windmills to generate much more power at lower wind speeds .
Doubling energy output
Fig. 22
Tests conducted in 1939 by the “ Prinsenmolen Committee ” showed that an improved windmill would start to turn with a wind speed of 3.5 to 4 m/s ( 7.75 to 9 mph ) compared to 5 to 6 m/s ( 11 to 13.5 mph ) for the old design .
At 5.5 m/s ( 12.5 mph ) their power was found to be equal to that of a normal mill at 8 m/s ( 18 mph ) .
This meant that while a traditional windmill could be worked for around 2,671 hours per year in the Netherlands , the new streamlined design could be operated for 4,442 hours per year – more or less doubling the annual energy output .
The improved windmill had two advantages ; a greater output at a given wind speed , and longer working hours by utilizing lighter winds .
The gain was especially found in lower wind speeds , because with stronger winds the sails of the improved windmill had to be reefed sooner .
Fig. 23
More improvements during the 1930s by Chris van Bussel , Kurt Bilau , G.J. Ten Have , Van Riet , P.L. Fauël ( Fig. 23 ) , Sabinin and Yurieff led to a windmill , installed in 1940 and demolished in 1960 , with up to two and a half times the power output of windmills with traditional sails : 125 horsepower .
Next , the Second World War stopped further investigations and after the war , like the rest of the world , the Dutch shifted their attention to the generation of electricity .
Revert to traditional windmills ?
Today , windmills and waterwheels that convert kinetic energy directly into mechanical energy are considered obsolete , and while some have survived , few of them have any commercial function in developed countries .
Wind turbines now turn renewable energy into electricity , which might later be converted back to mechanical energy .
Of course it is impossible to operate a flat screen television or a laptop with mechanical energy , but many other processes could in principle still be driven in that old - fashioned way .
Grain still has to be ground , wood still has to be sawn , seeds still have to be pressed , but now we use electricity to drive machines that perform the same processes .
This electricity can be generated by means of modern wind turbines , or other renewable energy sources , and that is the future that everybody has in mind .
Embodied energy
However , there are some reasons that might make it interesting to revert to a direct conversion from kinetic to mechanical energy .
Planting a few million high - tech wind turbines , covering deserts with solar plants and developing a smart grid and an elaborate electrical car infrastructure all sound attractive , but the most important question is whether there are enough material , energy and financial resources available to make those dreams ever come true .
Traditional windmills could be improved substantially with today ’s knowledge and materials
Available data on the reserves of exotic resources required for many eco-technologies look grim , and some time ago it was heard that China ( the main producer of important ecotech metals ) plans to restrict the export of those metals .
Windmills that convert kinetic energy directly to mechanical work could be operated without exotic materials .
High - tech traditional windmills
On a more positive note , traditional windmills could be improved substantially with today ’s knowledge and fairly common materials .
The gearings and sails could be made of steel or aluminum , which would seriously improve efficiency and also make windmills fireproof .
Being made entirely or in large part of wood , many windmills were destroyed by fire .
Of course , also the factory machinery inside the mill could be made much more efficient now .
Fig. 24
Windmills could be built much larger and thus more powerful .
To give an indication ; in 2005 , the Dutch built another traditional windmill , that generates electricity - the " Noletmolen " in Schiedam .
It stands almost 42 metres tall with sails 30 metres across , slightly less than the Murphy Mill in San Francisco .
It was built for promotional purposes by a distillery ( the town hosts 5 more historical mills built to produce Dutch gin ) .
Although the mill is not really a " mill " , it is built according to a traditional design , but using high - tech materials and sails ( Fig. 24 ) .
The result is a power output of more than 200 horsepower at the windshaft .
Take that , Energy Ball .
Fig. 25
Ecotech treatment
Backup power for a traditional windmill could be delivered by an electrical motor instead of horses ( or we could just work when the wind blows ) .
There is no doubt that now , 70 years later , an army of ecotech geeks could still seriously improve the Dutch experiments from the 1930s .
The results might not look as romantic as a traditional windmill , but very useful .
Of course , this is not a plea to eliminate electricity - generating wind turbines or even the electricity infrastructure altogether .
But , some things might be more efficiently done with direct conversion of kinetic energy to mechanical energy .
We will dive deeper into the history of renewable energy in forthcoming articles .

Few things are more cringe - inducing than blackface .
For a group of University of Toronto students , that 's the most recent lesson learned .
At a Halloween party on Oct. 29 , a Trinidadian student and four white friends decided to dress up as the Jamaican bobsled team from the 1993 kitsch film Cool Runnings .
They wore brightly coloured tracksuits , one dreadlocks wig and Jamaican flag T - shirts .
Oh , and face paint : for the black student , posing as the coach played by John Candy , thick white clown makeup .
For the white students , brown foundation slightly darker than George Hamilton 's self - tanner .
The day after the party , torontoist.com posted a photo of the group , kicking off a heated comment section debate on satire and tribute .
Criticism centred on the notion that the bobsled team had apparently won a costume prize .
" There was n't voting or any rationale or best costume award , " says Deryn Robson , a South Asian student at St. Michael 's College , who organizes events like the Halloween gathering for 1,500 at Mansion Bar and Wet Lounge .
Robson , who went as Mickey Mouse , says that after every party , he sends his mailing list a bunch of photos .
This time , he singled out group costumes he thought were fun .
But the U of T's Black Students ' Association wanted official apologies from the three colleges that threw the party .
Halloween is exuberantly tasteless , which usually slides until there 's an accusation of racism .

Thoughtful depictions of blackface ( think Bamboozled or Tropic Thunder ) have recently been considered worthwhile commentary .
In a defence posted on torontoist.com , the U of T group said the costume was a specific tribute to a movie that played " a large part in our childhoods . "
But Sanelifo Moyo , social chair for the Black Students '
Association , says their costumes were too undefined to be taken seriously .
" In no way did their costumes represent the Jamaican bobsled team . "
" If you ask 50 different people , they 'll all see 50 different things , " says Stephen Johnson , a professor at U of T who has studied blackface and minstrelsy for 20 years .
Johnson says that while actors and costume - wearers want to invoke specific characters , viewers who have had racist experiences could be legitimately hurt or offended .
The Black Students ' Association and other student groups organized a Tuesday night town hall meeting on the uproar .
Some 250 students turned up for a quick lesson on the history of blackface from U of T professors , followed by a discussion .
The bobsled group was there and submitted an apology .
Robson was n't bothered by the Cool Runnings getup , saying the fivesome are being " unfairly pegged as racist . "

It is day six of the ' scandal ' over the hacked emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia ’s School of Environmental Sciences , in which a thousand or so private email messages between climate scientists were hacked into and made public .
According to the ostriches hoping that Copenhagen will fail , these emails demonstrate that climate - science is in serious trouble .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
If you need a full backgrounder on the ‘ scandal ’ , see the University of East Anglia ’s statement , which includes a direct rebuttal of the single seemingly most - damaging e-mail , which read :
I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline .
See also the Guardian ’s initial coverage , and Carbon Fixated ’s post on Newtongate for a brilliant historical parallel and parody of James Delingpole ’s hysteria in the Telegraph .
The University of East Anglia is where I work and teach .
The ‘ scandal ’ here has I think been gotten out of all proportion in some of the media , old and new .
I have now read a good number of the ' worst ' of the hacked emails .
I also know a couple of the protagonists personally , and for human - interest value the hacked emails certainly do offer some tidbits .
But when the dust settles , I predict that the climate - deniers will be left holding onto hardly anything here .
There is so far as I can tell at this stage no significant scientific scandal , and most importantly absolutely no reason to doubt any of the fundamentals of the science of man-made climate change here , just a few unpleasant or silly or ( at worst ) unwise and bad - practice emails .
Scientists are n't angels ; like the rest of us , they sometimes get angry with their detractors , and even work to marginalise them , and so on .
Some good that may come out of this is :
For more people to realise that scientists are simply human , and that science is not holy writ , but to realise too that these facts and the poor behaviour at times of some scientists does n't in itself cast any doubt over the central findings of their research .
To doubt the greenhouse effect or to doubt major anthropogenic climate change is about as sensible as doubting anthropogenic lung cancer ( The two cases are actually quite similar - both involve pollution of a finite air - system ; and both have seen long - lasting and well - funded campaigns of denial .
The smoking companies got away with denying anthropogenic lung cancer for a whole generation , before they were finally smoked out . )
There are quite a lot of calls now for the full data - sets which the best British climate scientists base their work and their predictions on to be made fully public .
That would I think be welcome , and the UEA climate - scientists should step up efforts to realise this aspiration - it would among other things dispose of the climate - sceptics ' silly accusations of there being a conspiracy here , of something big being hidden .
There do seem to be a few instances in the hacked emails - if these particular ones are genuine - of clearly unethical and possibly unlawful behaviour .
If this hacking episode means that there is less of that in future , then that will of course be a very positive result .
That is presumably why the UEA administration have now initiated an independent review , “ which will address the issue of data security , an assessment of how we responded to a deluge of Freedom of Information requests , and any other relevant issues which the independent reviewer advises should be addressed . ”
As a philosopher of science , it worries me to see the level of ignorance displayed by many of those who are jumping all over this leaked information as if it undermines the science around global warming .
Except possibly in some literally marginal ways , it simply does not , once you understand the context of most of these emails .
Furthermore , as a commenter said on my blog , “ I would like to be able to inspect all e-mails ever sent or received by ( a ) anyone connected with the major oil companies [ that funded climate - denial organisations ] , ( b ) at least a few of those who have been most vocal in their scepticism to man-made climate change . ”
A reasonable request …
But changes 1 through 3 are nevertheless potentially good news for science and for all of us .
To find out more , the best place to go is Real Climate .
Meanwhile , several UEA and other scientists are having to change their bank accounts , their passports , etc. , because the hackers thoughtlessly publicised emails with details of those things in them .
Thoughtless and heartless , as well as ( obviously ) illegal .
As I ’ve said : there are some things in the e-mails that should n’t be there .
I think that there will need to be more apologies , before this thing is over , and some changes of future practice .
But the real scandal is not what is in the emails ; nor is it even the illegal and thoughtless hacking operation .
The real scandal is that , as we run up to Copenhagen , much of the media and blogosphere is pre-occupied with a few minor pieces of dirty - laundry in some e-mails , when the very fate of humankind is at stake .
The real scandal is that climate - change scepticism has brought us to this point , where only a few years separate us from the likely onset of runaway climate change .
Respect to any climate - deniers who invest all their pension funds in seashore hotels in the Maldives … otherwise , they should step aside , and let the work of saving the future begin .
The real scandal is that the human race has neither paid enough attention to the climate scientists nor changed its ( by which I mean our ) way of life so that that life can go on .
Sam Tanenhaus ' New Yorker review of Sarah Palin 's book , as well as another book about the former governor , contains this nugget :
Palin , though notoriously ill - travelled outside the United States , did journey far to the first of the four colleges she attended , in Hawaii .
She and a friend who went with her lasted only one semester .
“ Hawaii was a little too perfect , ” Palin writes .
“ Perpetual sunshine is n’t necessarily conducive to serious academics for eighteen - year - old Alaska girls . ”
Perhaps not .
But Palin ’s father , Chuck Heath , gave a different account to [ Scott ] Conroy and [ Shushannah ]
Walshe [ authors of ' Sarah From Alaska ' ] .
According to him , the presence of so many Asians and Pacific Islanders made her uncomfortable : “ They were a minority type thing and it was n’t glamorous , so she came home . ” [ Italics Mine ]
Why -- and readers should weigh in -- has this gotten absolutely no media attention ?
The military at large has also felt the growing influence of JSOC .
Indeed , General Stanley McChrystal , now the top military commander in Afghanistan , led JSOC from 2003 to 2008 .
McChrystal 's extensive special operations in Iraq , credited as crucial in the country 's stabilization , earned both him and JSOC wide support in the military and in Washington .
In his high - powered role in Afghanistan , McChrystal is increasingly turning to his old command .
Spencer Ackerman reports that JSOC 's current leadership is " playing a large and previously unreported role in shaping the Obama administration 's Afghanistan and Pakistan strategy . "
That new influence includes strategic decision - making and direct involvement in the more traditional warfare conducted by the conventional military .
Ackerman writes :
In his Afghanistan review , McChrystal said that a key goal for him would be to increase coordination between his NATO command and the independent command of JSOC , which suggested that the dichotomy between using Special Operations Forces for counterterrorism and conventional forces for counterinsurgency was eroding .
More evidence of the the growing special operations footprint can be found in the Special Operation Command 's latest budgetary requests , which include 2,000 all - terrain vehicles and $ 7 million in training for handling detainees .
All of which begs the question , Is JSOC an intelligence agency or a branch of the military ?
It is technically part of the military hierarchy , but its de facto status may be more complicated .
Though it 's unclear who JSOC currently reports to , it developed under McChrystal as a tool of the Bush White House .
In a story on JSOC 's contracting of private military firm Blackwater , Scahill quotes former Col. Lawrence Wilkerson , the former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell :
" What I was seeing was the development of what I would later see in Iraq and Afghanistan , where Special Operations forces would operate in both theaters without the conventional commander even knowing what they were doing . " ...
Wilkerson said that almost immediately after assuming his role at the State Department under Colin Powell , he saw JSOC being politicized and developing a close relationship with the executive branch .
He saw this begin , he said , after his first Delta Force briefing at Fort Bragg .
" I think Cheney and Rumsfeld went directly into JSOC .
I think they went into JSOC at times , perhaps most frequently , without the SOCOM [ Special Operations ] commander at the time even knowing it .
The receptivity in JSOC was quite good , " says Wilkerson .
" I think Cheney was actually giving McChrystal instructions , and McChrystal was asking him for instructions .
...
At that point you had JSOC operating as an extension of the [ administration ] doing things the executive branch -- read : Cheney and Rumsfeld - - wanted it to do .
This would be more or less carte blanche .
You need to do it , do it . "
It 's hard to say exactly why JSOC 's authority is being expanded so rapidly .
It could be little more than internal politics .
The CIA was widely disgraced by revelations that it was funding Ahmed Wali Karzai , brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and a big player in the opium trade that indirectly funds the Taliban .
The CIA has also been embattled in a politically contentious turf war with the Director of National Intelligence , as Marc reported .
Or , McChrystal may simply be giving his former colleagues a leg up , or any number of back - room political machinations .
But I have a hunch this bit from Scahill 's story could have something to do with it :
The military intelligence source says that the CIA [ predator drone ] operations are subject to Congressional oversight , unlike the parallel JSOC bombings .
President Obama has had a tough time surrendering Bush - era executive powers on national security .
The use of JSOC as an independent intelligence and military force run out of the White House and unconstrained by congressional oversight would be tough to resist for any president .

Three US Congressmen , outraged that parts of US government airport security manuals were inadvertently published and then posted on Wikileaks and Cryptome , are demanding to know what legal weapons are available against whistleblowing websites .
Republicans Peter King , Charles Dent and Gus Bilirakis wrote to the Department of Homeland Security this week with a series of questions about the bodged publication of a Transport Security Administration ( TSA ) document .
The manual revealed standard screening procedures at airports .
Sensitive portions had been redacted before it was published , but a simple cut - and - paste operation beat the attempted blackout .
The results , which discussed limitations of screening equipment and procedures , were posted on Cryptome and Wikileaks .
In a letter the Congressmen asked : " How has the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration addressed the repeated reposting of this security manual to other websites and what legal action , if any , can be taken to compel its removal ? "
The answer of course , as experience shows , is none .
Repeated legal huffing and puffing at Wikileaks by offshore banks , air traffic controllers , calculator makers and Scientologists has met with no success .
Or at least no success that has had any effect , thanks to the site 's global network of mirror servers .
Cryptome meanwhile specialises in national - security - related documents , and is long - versed in the celebrated strategy adopted by the respondent in Arkell v Pressdram .
But perhaps aware that takedown has proved impossible , the Republican trio also ask if DHS believes " criminal penalties necessary or desirable to ensure such information is not reposted in the future ? "
The Congressmen 's other questions are about TSA redaction procedures , how the blunder came about and what officials will do to avoid a repeat .

I ’m going to jump on the band wagon today and talk about something that is a hot topic for the day .
Currently News Corp. ( owners of Fox ) and Time Warner Cable are in deadlocked negotiations over renewing of a contract .
This effects me directly as their current contract is set to expire at the end of the year , as in tonight .
If an agreement is n’t met then at that time all of News Corp ’s television stations we be blacked out on Time Warner Cable ’s television services .
As a Time Warner subscriber I stand to loose my ability to watch these channels come the new year .
Now , I highly doubt that it will come to that , as both companies stand to loose a lot from not reaching a deal .
Generally speaking I am not a fan of Time Warner , over the years I ’ve had a lot of issues with their service ( or lack there of sometimes ) , their pricing structure and above all our the idea of pro-rated bandwidth .
Despite all that however in this argument I feel compelled to take their side .
The demands News Corp is making on them just seems to me to be greedy .
Where most networks get $ 0.25 per customer per month News Corp is now demanding $ 1 .
My initial feelings about this is they are trying to make up for lost revenue from a continue increase in people who are no longer spending time in front of their TV , much less spending time watching Fox stations .
With an increase in the number of people using DVRs and streaming Media I can see why advertising dollars may be down , but that should n’t be a call to arms to try and nickel and dime people to death .
News Corp needs to find new creative and innovative ways to generate revenue off of their content rather than trying to charge television providers more for simply offering the availability to view their content .
There is many different ways to view the content that is provided by News Corp , unfortunately right now the easiest , and yes something the only choice , is over standard television networks .
I do n’t particularly care if I loose the Fox Network as any show on there that I feel like watching I will find a way to watch , it is that simple .
Unfortunately , at the current time it seems that Fox is favored to win it ’s full demands .
Which will likely lead me and many others to re-evaluate our Time Warner Subscriptions .

Abu Dhabi : A South Korean consortium won a Dh75 billion ( $ 20.4 billion ) contract to build nuclear reactors in the UAE , beating more favoured American and French companies for one of the Middle East 's biggest energy deals .
President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and South Korean President Lee Myung - bak attended the signing of a series of landmark cooperation agreements , WAM reported .
The agreements , signed by Foreign Minister Shaikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and South Korean Minister of Knowledge Economy Choi Kyung - hwan , cover a framework protocol to boost economic partnership to strengthen cooperation in a number of areas , including the development of peaceful nuclear energy .
Shaikh Abdullah said : " As negotiations between the UAE and South Korea on peaceful nuclear energy advanced , the two governments discovered the huge potential for joint cooperation in various fields . "
Under the nuclear contract , the group led by Korea Electric Power Corporation ( Kepco ) will design , build and help operate four 1,400 - megawatt civilian nuclear power units , a statement by Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation ( Enec ) said .
" Enec has determined that the Kepco team is best equipped to fulfil the government 's partnership requirements in this ambitious programme , " Enec Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said in a statement .
Mohammad Al Hammadi , Chief Executive of Enec , said ten locations for the plants have been proposed .
Al Hammadi said Emiratis will make up 60 per cent of the estimated 2,200 professionals overseeing operation of the plants .
The plants are expected to provide 25 per cent of the country 's power needs by 2020 .
Key points
The winning consortium includes Korea Electric Power Corp , Hyundai Engineering and Construction , Samsung C&T Corp and Doosan Heavy Industries .
The award is the largest - ever energy contract in the Middle East and one of the world 's biggest nuclear power plant contracts .
The first of the four units is scheduled to begin providing electricity to the grid in 2017 , with the three later units being completed by 2020 .
" Following a comprehensive and detailed review of three excellent bids from some of the world 's top nuclear suppliers , operators and construction firms , Enec has determined that the Kepco team is best equipped to fulfill the government 's partnership requirements in this ambitious program , " said Khaldoon Al Mubarak , Chairman of Enec .
" The nature of this project will require a partnership that endures for nearly 100 years .
This arrangement has driven us to focus on a very careful assessment of what characteristics among the competing consortia would translate into the best over - all fit in a partner for our program . "
Enec Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Al Hammadi , further explained the decision , saying : " We were impressed with the Kepco team 's world - class safety performance , and its demonstrated ability to meet the UAE program goals .
Additionally , Kepco dedicated a highly experienced team to our project and has shown a serious commitment to transferring the knowledge gained from Korea 's 30 years of successful nuclear industry operation into the UAE program . "

" We look forward to a long and productive relationship as we work toward powering the future growth of the UAE with low - carbon , peaceful nuclear energy , " Al Hammadi said .
The contract calls for the Kepco team to design , build and help operate four 1,400 - MW civil nuclear power units .
The value of the contract for the construction , commissioning and fuel loads for four units equaled approximately US $ 20 billion , with a high percentage of the contract being offered under a fixed - price arrangement .
In addition to the delivery of the four plants , Enec and Kepco have also agreed to key terms under which Korean investors will have an equity interest in the project .
This arrangement will further strengthen the business relationship and powerfully incentivize the partners to ensure that the necessary experience , technology and skills are available to achieve on - time and on - budget delivery and safe and reliable operation of the plants .
The contract contains provisions that lower risk to the project and allow the UAE to model its nuclear industry on that developed by Korea during the past three decades .
The first of the four units is scheduled to begin providing electricity to the grid in 2017 , with the three later units being completed by 2020 .
Given the growth in electricity demand projected for the United Arab Emirates , it is expected that additional units beyond the original four will be procured in the future as the UAE expands its fleet of civil nuclear power plants .
The contract also calls for extensive training , human resource development , and education programs as the UAE builds the capacity to eventually staff the vast majority of the nuclear energy program with national talent , and develops the industrial infrastructure and commercial businesses to serve a thriving nuclear energy industry .
Additionally , Enec and Kepco have agreed to work together on business ventures in the utility and energy fields outside the boundaries of the UAE project .
" We are extremely pleased to be selected by Enec as its partner in the United Arab Emirates civil nuclear power program and it will be our top priority to devote our resources and efforts towards the successful delivery of the world 's safest , most reliable and cost - efficient nuclear power plants , " said Mr. Ssang Su , Kim , President and CEO of Kepco .
" We are fully committed to Enec 's goal of providing electricity to the UAE using safe and peaceful nuclear energy , and we have begun mobilizing a team so that we can begin work immediately , " Kim added .
Kim emphasized the far - reaching nature of the commercial partnership , noting that the plant to be commissioned in 2017 will remain in operation until at least 2077 .
" Kepco will also provide the UAE with its accumulated know - how and experience in developing nuclear power plants , and the Korean government will provide its full support in various aspects of the program to encourage further exchange and collaboration between our two countries , " he said .
While welcoming the new partnership with the Kepco - led consortium , Enec officials were quick to point out that discussions continue with the other bidders with regard to potential cooperation in areas outside the scope of the Prime Contract , like long - term fuel supply , joint investments , training and education , among others .
About Kepco
Kepco , a government owned - utility , is the world 's third largest nuclear energy business with an installed nuclear generation capacity of 17,716MW as of the end of 2008 .
Kepco operates 20 commercial nuclear power units as of 2009 , with eight more units currently under construction and an additional 10 units planned to be built by 2030 .
Kepco is also recognized as a world leader in safety , and plant reliability and efficiency , as assessed by the World Association of Nuclear Operators ( Wano ) , the international organization established to maximize the safety and reliability of the operation of nuclear power plants .
Kepco currently receives among the highest scores in the Wano Performance Indicator program , which quantifies performance standards for nuclear operators around the world .
Importantly , Kepco has also developed a strong record for constructing nuclear power plants that meet stringent industry quality standards and are delivered on time and on budget .
Kepco will supply the full scope of works and services for the UAE Civil Nuclear Power Program including engineering , procurement , construction , nuclear fuel and operations and maintenance support with the assistance of other Korean members of the Kepco team , including Samsung , Hyundai , Doosan Heavy Industries and Kepco subsidiaries :
Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co. , Ltd. ( KHNP ) , which will play a key role as the Engineering , Procurement and Construction ( EPC ) contractor and operator
Korea Power Engineering Co. , Inc. ( Kopec ) , which will provide the nuclear power plant design and engineering service
Korea Nuclear Fuel Co. , Ltd. ( KNF ) , which will provide the nuclear fuel
Korea Plant Service and Engineering Co. , Ltd. ( KPS ) , which will be involved in plant maintenance
Non-Korean companies involved in the KEPCO team include Westinghouse of the US , and Toshiba of Japan .
The Technology
Enec has decided to build Kepco's APR1400 , a Generation III , 1400 Megawatt nuclear power plant with evolutionary improvements in safety , performance , and environmental impact that meets the highest international standards for safety and performance .
The APR1400 design was developed by the Korean nuclear industry under the leadership of Kepco over a period of 10 years beginning 1992 .
A certificate for the standard design approval was issued for the APR1400 by the Korean regulatory authority in 2002 .
The APR1400 is similar to , but represents an improvement over , the System 80 + design which was previously certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) in the United States .
The first of the APR1400 units , Shin-Kori units 3&4 , are now under construction , having obtained a Construction Permit from the Korean regulatory authority .
Shin -Kori unit 3 will be connected to Korea 's grid by 2013 .
The first UAE nuclear power plant will be the fifth unit of the APR1400 plants in the world , and Shin-Kori plants will serve as the " reference plants " for the UAE program .
As such , Kepco will construct plants that are essentially the same as the " reference plants , " but supplemented with changes required to adapt to UAE climactic conditions and any specific requirements of the UAE nuclear safety regulator , the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation ( FANR ) .
Enhanced Safety
As a Generation III reactor , the APR1400 has been designed to meet heightened safety goals developed in accordance with the latest international safety standards , which aim to secure an additional margin of safety to protect the public health .
The APR1400 design incorporates more than 30 years of operational learning and resulting enhancements to safety , reliability and efficiency .
The APR1400 safety system is designed to prevent or mitigate severe accidents by ensuring reactor shutdown , removing decay heat , maintaining the integrity of the containment facility , and preventing radioactive releases .
It is designed to meet the procedural requirements and criteria of the US NRC regulations , including the post Three Mile Island ( TMI ) accident requirements for new plants .
In addition , the building and structures in the UAE plants will be designed to fulfill the latest requirements for earthquake safety and aircraft impact resistance .
By deploying only a third - generation design , the UAE 's future fleet of nuclear reactors will boast safety levels significantly above those of existing nuclear fleets that are still dominated by second - generation designs .
Enec evaluation process
Enec 's year - long prime contractor selection process was designed to identify the best long - term partner for the UAE as it undertakes its civil nuclear energy program .
The process was guided by the Policy of the United Arab Emirates on the Evaluation and Potential Development of Peaceful Nuclear Energy , which set strict standards for safety and security , non proliferation and sustainability .
Specifically , Enec focused on five core criteria in reaching its final decision .
Safety –
All three teams involved in the Prime Contractor Selection process demonstrated that their technology and safety programs fully met the latest international standards and that their operational safety performance was among the world 's highest .
Having all met that most important criterion , the three teams were further evaluated against the remaining criteria :
Deliverability – A demonstrated ability to meet the Enec program goals and to begin delivering electricity to the UAE power grid in 2017 .
Contract Compliance – Conformance with Enec 's proposed " prime contractor " business structure , which was designed to ensure that accountability for project deliverables would rest with a single prime contractor entity , while appropriately minimizing the contractor integration and management burden on Enec .
Human Resource Development – A commitment to , and detailed planning for , human resource development in the UAE in support of the development of a sustainable , domestically sourced nuclear energy workforce that is dominated by competent national talent .
Commercial Competitiveness – A commercial proposal that promoted UAE economic competitiveness via the provision of low - cost electricity and via the establishment of partnering opportunities to accelerate the development of the UAE nuclear industry , as well as appropriately assigned risk reflecting the long - term nature of the commercial and operational relationship contemplated within the draft prime contract .
A team of 75 dedicated experts evaluated the bids during the last year .
Collectively , the team boasted more than 900 years of directly relevant experience in the nuclear industry .
The team was made up of experts in the following fields : nuclear power plant safety , design and construction ; operations and maintenance ; nuclear quality assurance , supply chain management and procurement ; nuclear fuel procurement and management ( including safeguards , non proliferation and spent fuel management ) ; siting analysis ( including environmental impact assessment , seismology , geology , meteorology and hydrology ) ; finance ( including generation cost modeling and project finance ) ; legal and contracting ; program management ; utility operations ; and communications and community relations .
Kepco is expected to begin mobilizing its team in Abu Dhabi immediately .
Hee Yong Lee , one of Kepco 's most senior executives , will lead the UAE project .
A trained nuclear engineer , Mr. Lee has worked for Kepco 's for more than 30 years in the fields of construction management , quality assurance , long - term power planning , as well as in training , commissioning and operations at nuclear power plants .
Enec is currently in the advanced stages of evaluating a number of potential sites for nuclear power plants throughout all regions of the UAE .
A team of UAE and international experts is conducting detailed scientific studies on seismology , geology , environment impact and other factors related to siting .
That study and others will contribute to the final decision on where to build the units .
Program Background
Energy Demand
The Government of Abu Dhabi established Enec following an evaluation of the UAE 's future energy needs that determined the country would need to substantially increase its generating capacity to meet expected electricity demand .
The UAE 's evaluation of its energy needs was wide - ranging and resulted in the following findings :
That volumes of natural gas that could be made available to the nation 's electricity sector would be insufficient to meet future demand .
That the burning of liquids ( crude oil and / or diesel ) would be logistically viable but both costly and environmentally harmful .
That coal - fired power generation while potentially cheaper , would be environmentally unacceptable , and potentially vulnerable from a security of supply standpoint .
And finally , that the deployment of renewable and other alternative energy supplies , while desirable , would only be able to supply approximately 6 - 7 % of the required electricity generation capacity by 2020 .
Four factors supported the decision to begin the program :
Economics –
Well run nuclear energy plants are among the most efficient producers of electricity .
Security of fuel supply – Nuclear power plants have high availability factors ( in excess of 90 % ) and can operate for 18 - 24 months on a single fuel load .
Environment – Nuclear plants emit no greenhouse gases and represent an important tool for combating climate change .
Industrial Development – A sustainable nuclear energy program will create new service industries and high - value jobs , while enhancing economic development throughout the UAE .
Human Resource Development – Essential to the Program and the Nation
Central to the UAE 's approach to developing a nuclear energy program has been the importance of building a qualified workforce in the short and long term .
Enec has joined with the Khalifa University of Science , Technology and Research , the Institute of Applied Technology , the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation , other parts of the UAE educational system , as well as universities internationally to ensure that there will be a reservoir of talent , both Emirati and expatriate , well into the future .
Current estimates are that the program will need between 2,100 and 2,300 staff by 2020 .
Enec is committed to ensuring that talented Emirati women and men play a major role in the program – occupying positions of authority and responsibility in all aspects of the nuclear energy industry .
Nuclear Fuel – Strategies under development
Enec is in the process of developing and implementing a strategy for the management of all nuclear fuel cycle activities including the procurement , use , and short - and long - term management of nuclear fuel for its nuclear power plants .
The strategy conforms to guidelines established by the International Atomic Energy Agency and will be continually updated , taking into account new information and technological advances from the nuclear industry during the next decades , before the long - term spent fuel management plan is implemented .
The UAE policy on nuclear energy
The UAE 's comprehensive approach to nuclear energy is detailed in the Policy of the United Arab Emirates on the Evaluation and Potential Development of Peaceful Nuclear Energy , a document released in April 2008 .
One of the main pillars of the policy is the decision to develop the program with safety and non-proliferation as its foundation , and to forgo domestic enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear fuel , the two parts of the nuclear fuel cycle that can most readily be used for non-peaceful purposes .
This policy establishes a new model through which non-nuclear states may explore and potentially deploy nuclear energy with the full support and confidence of the international community .
International observers and non-proliferation experts have called the UAE model the " gold standard " for developing a nuclear energy program .
The UAE has now signed or is in the process of signing agreements for cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear energy with numerous countries , including the France , Korea , the United States and others .
This one is either a sequel or prequel to the last comic .
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
A train collision in northern India killed at least 22 people early Wednesday .
Indian Railway Protection Force personnel look at a damaged carriage after the collision Wednesday .
Railway officials confirmed the deaths and also said people were 26 injured in the crash .
The Goa Express slammed into the stationary Mewar Express apparently because the driver overshot a signal to stop , said Anant Swaroop , spokesman for India 's northern railway .
Indian Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee ordered an inquiry into the crash , according to CNN 's sister station in India , CNN - IBN .
The Goa Express , bound for New Delhi from the western coastal state of Goa , was running on the same track as the Mewar , which shuttles between New Delhi and Udaipur , in western Rajasthan state .
Both trains have stops in Mathura , about 90 miles south of New Delhi .
Rescuers had to cut trapped passengers from a wrecked car of the Mewar Express .
The car had a special compartment for women , disabled passengers , cargo and train guards , said Aditya Verma , a senior police official in Mathura .
Bannerjee said victims ' relatives would receive compensation of about $ 10,000 , according to CNN - IBN .
Several other trains that go through the Mathura station had to be diverted .
Trains are the most widely used mode of transportation for national travel in India .

NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Google Inc. has blacklisted all CNET reporters for a year , after the popular technology news website published personal information of one of Google 's founders in a story about growing privacy concerns for the Internet search engine , according to a CNET statement .
CNET on Friday reported " Google representatives have instituted a policy of not talking with CNET News reporters until July 2006 in response to privacy issues raised by a previous story . "
That story , by reporter Elinor Mills ran under the headline " Google balances privacy , reach . "
Google spokesman David Krane told CNN the company declined comment .
The CNET story , dated July 14 , focused on privacy concerns since Google is amassing such enormous amounts of data about people .
It reported that some analysts fear it is becoming a great risk to privacy , because it would be a tempting target for hackers , " zealous government investigators , or even a Google insider who falls short of the company 's ethics , " the article said .
To underscore its point about how much personal information is available , the CNET report published some personal information about Google 's CEO Eric Schmidt -- his salary ; his neighborhood , some of his hobbies and political donations -- all obtained through Google searches .
Schmidt is officially Google 's chief champion and defender , and has publicly said that there has to be a trade - off between privacy concerns and functionality .
He has brought up Google 's corporate motto , " Do n't Be Evil " in those defenses .
Just last week , a different technology changed its mind about cutting its ties with a Wall Street analyst .
Altera Corp 's chief financial officer apologized , and reversed its decision to stop talking to Tad LaFountain , an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities LLC who had argued that the company 's share buyback program would hurt Altera 's stock .
Altera CFO Nathan Sarkisian said in a press release , " Regrettably , as a result of our action and the ensuing press coverage , some have concluded that our intention was to manipulate opinion . "

Zach Braff – Facebook Proved I was alive
So Zach Braff , star of Scrubs was on Conan last night .
I am not a Scrubs fan , or really much of a Zach Braff fan , but he dropped a gem last night .
Conan and Braff were talking about the fake death rumors that were circulating the internet about Braff earlier this year .
Conan asked him how you clear up something like that ?
Braff responded with :
I went on Facebook … You know …
You can quickly be like , hey I ’m alive !
This was hilarious .
He then went on to talk about how he and Co - Stars of scrubs had a little fun with proving his vitality on the internet .
Comedy aside , Braff is absolutely right .
Facebook is a great medium to communicate with fans and the “ real world ” .
Whether it ’s interacting with fans , or proving that you have n’t committed suicide , Facebook and social media in general is a tool that all stars should adapt to connect with their fans .
So , well - played Zach , happy to still have you here .

The Jerusalem Post says Obama is scaling back his diplomacy :
With the Palestinians refusing to return to the negotiations , Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu not calling for a complete settlement freeze and the Arab world declining to make any gestures to Israel , the current sense in Jerusalem is that the US is scaling back its intensive involvement in the diplomatic process .
The best example of this is that US Middle East envoy George Mitchell has not been to the region in over a month and is not now expected to come back until January , after the holiday season in the US .
The feeling in Jerusalem is that Washington believed that Netanyahu 's moratorium would move the process along a bit , and when the Palestinians failed to respond positively to the move , the US decided to sit back and see how things would play out .
Obama took office claiming a once - in - a - generation opportunity for a comprehensive peace had arrived .
Sadly , it seems that it may have passed .

We economists have a reputation for being dry and boring .
That 's why Ben Stein 's scene in Ferris Bueller 's Day Off works so well — and why this guy is such a novelty .
Given our dismal reputation , I am happy to report that some economists ' recent defenses of the efficient - markets hypothesis are laugh - out - loud funny .
Outside Cirque du Soleil , you will not see such contortions as when these economists try to defend their theory from either refutation or triviality .
Krugman Launches the Attack
The efficient - markets hypothesis ( EMH ) comes in many forms of varying strength .
Much like evolution , it is difficult to debate the issue because people can switch the definition in mid-argument .
In evolution , not even a TV evangelist would deny that " organisms evolve over time , " while on the other hand , many biologists would recognize that Richard Dawkins goes too far when he thinks that the theory of evolution by itself virtually disproves the existence of God .
This same problem exists when it comes to the EMH .
In its weakest form , it simply means that new information tends to get incorporated quickly into stock prices , meaning that there can't be any obvious arbitrage opportunities lying around ( since someone would have exploited them already ) .
However , the most fanatical EMH advocates come close to saying that financial bubbles are literally impossible .
The EMH is associated with the Chicago School of economics .
It has been understandably condemned after the financial crisis — especially since the statists have done a good job pinning the blame on " deregulated free markets . "
Paul Krugman summed up the anti-EMH view nicely in this pop article in the New York Times magazine .
In response to Krugman and other critics of neoclassical economics , the mainstream defenders have left their ivory castles to repel the invaders .
Although Austrian readers are naturally sympathetic to anyone who picks a fight with Paul Krugman , we should be careful in choosing our allies .
Elsewhere I have pointed out the serious flaws ( from an Austrian perspective ) in John Cochrane 's response to Krugman .
In the rest of this article , I 'll highlight some of the sillier defenses offered by other neoclassical apologists of the EMH .
Robert Lucas
In a lengthy and very serious piece , Nobel laureate Robert Lucas defends mainstream economics ( and the EMH in particular ) from the scurrilous charges :
Macroeconomists in particular were caricatured as a lost generation educated in the use of valueless , even harmful , mathematical models , an education that made them incapable of conducting sensible economic policy .
I think this caricature is nonsense and of no value in thinking about the larger questions :
What can the public reasonably expect of specialists in these areas , and how well has it been served by them in the current crisis ?
One thing we are not going to have , now or ever , is a set of models that forecasts sudden falls in the value of financial assets , like the declines that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers in September .
This is nothing new .
It has been known for more than 40 years and is one of the main implications of Eugene Fama 's " efficient - markets hypothesis " ( EMH ) , which states that the price of a financial asset reflects all relevant , generally available information .
If an economist had a formula that could reliably forecast crises a week in advance , say , then that formula would become part of generally available information and prices would fall a week earlier .
Lucas 's arguments here are typical in this debate .
He offers a seductive mixture of assertion and non sequitur to make his case .
First , the EMH is itself under dispute , so it hardly helps to cite the EMH and its implications .
( This is akin to a Christian quoting the Bible to an atheist to prove the authority of Scripture . )
Now , in what sense has it " been known for more than 40 years " that it 's impossible to predict sudden falls in asset values ?
Did n't Mark Thornton and others warn us that the housing bubble was too good to be true several years before the crash ?
What more could an Austrian cynic do to disprove the EMH , than to predict that " the market " was all wrong when it came to housing prices , risk premiums , and so forth ?
Investors who heeded the warnings of Thornton and others got out of the stock market , did n't buy houses to flip in 2005 , and , otherwise , managed to outperform other people who were caught up in the euphoric boom .
If that 's not " beating the market , " what is ?
Notice , there is a flaw in Lucas 's argument .
He is saying that if an economist could reliably predict a crash in a week , then everyone would know it now and the crash would happen immediately .
There are two problems here .
First , an economist can accurately predict a crash , but it does n't follow that everyone else will automatically follow suit .
In the real world , some economists are bullish and some are bearish at the same time .
So , which way is the market supposed to move ?
The EMH fan would probably say , " Aha !
That just proves how right the EMH is .
We do n't have any reason to suspect the market will go up or down , because the current price reflects all available theories and information . "
Yet , the market price will go up or down , showing that at least one forecaster was wrong .
( The other one might have just been lucky , so we can't say for sure that his prediction was really correct in the grand scheme . )
The second major flaw in Lucas 's neat little demonstration , is that he assumes the formula for an impending crash must be very time specific .
But what if someone like Mark Thornton says , " This situation is unsustainable .
Housing prices cannot continue to rise at these rates " ?
That is still an accurate prediction .
It is definitely useful to investors , especially if the forecaster gives a broad period , within which the move will occur .
In this situation , where some forecasters make qualitative predictions , Lucas 's quick argument falls apart .
We are back in the conventional world , where different forecasters rely on different theories to make different recommendations .
The investors who listen to the bad ones lose money , while the investors who heed the more accurate theories make money .
You can " beat the market " if you invest based on more accurate predictions .
Is this really that strange a concept ?
Lucas goes on to argue that the EMH is not a mere tautology ; empirical testing backs it up :
Mr Fama arrived at the EMH through some simple theoretical examples .
This simplicity was criticised in The Economist 's briefing , as though the EMH applied only to these hypothetical cases .
But Mr Fama tested the predictions of the EMH on the behaviour of actual prices .
These tests could have come out either way , but they came out very favourably .
His empirical work was novel and carefully executed .
It has been thoroughly challenged by a flood of criticism which has served mainly to confirm the accuracy of the hypothesis .
Over the years exceptions and " anomalies " have been discovered ( even tiny departures are interesting if you are managing enough money ) but for the purposes of macroeconomic analysis and forecasting these departures are too small to matter .
( emphasis added )
Wait a second .
Lucas has now considerably weakened his defense .
Earlier he said that beating the market was an impossibility ; moreover , an impossibility that had been known for 40 years .
Yet in his discussion of the falsifiable tests , he admits that there are departures from the theory .
So , now we have Lucas himself admitting that the EMH fails in the microscopic particulars .
I still maintain that it failed spectacularly in the recent housing bubble , as well as the earlier dot - com bubble ( which many Austrians also called , before it popped ) .
What would it take for Lucas to admit that the EMH is n't true ?
Before moving on , let 's quote one more gem from Lucas :
The Economist 's briefing also cited as an example of macroeconomic failure the " reassuring " simulations that Frederic Mishkin , then a governor of the Federal Reserve , presented in the summer of 2007 .
The charge is that the Fed 's FRB / US forecasting model failed to predict the events of September 2008 .
Yet the simulations were not presented as assurance that no crisis would occur , but as a forecast of what could be expected conditional on a crisis not occurring .
Until the Lehman failure the recession was pretty typical of the modest downturns of the post - war period .
There was a recession under way , led by the decline in housing construction .
Mr Mishkin 's forecast was a reasonable estimate of what would have followed if the housing decline had continued to be the only or the main factor involved in the economic downturn .
After the Lehman bankruptcy , too , models very like the one Mr Mishkin had used , combined with new information , gave what turned out to be very accurate estimates of the private - spending reductions that ensued over the next two quarters .
When Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Fed , warned Hank Paulson , the then treasury secretary , of the economic danger facing America immediately after Lehman 's failure , he knew what he was talking about .
Mr Mishkin recognised the potential for a financial crisis in 2007 , of course .
Mr Bernanke certainly did as well .
But recommending pre-emptive monetary policies on the scale of the policies that were applied later on would have been like turning abruptly off the road because of the potential for someone suddenly to swerve head - on into your lane .
The best and only realistic thing you can do in this context is to keep your eyes open and hope for the best .
( emphasis added )
Let 's put aside Lucas 's funny defense of Mishkin and Bernanke , which says they 're very good at predicting economic conditions , except for those pesky financial disasters .
Beyond that side splitter , Lucas is simply making stuff up in the excerpt above .
Ben Bernanke , most assuredly , did not convey that he had any inkling of what lay ahead for the US economy .
Watch this incredible compilation of Bernanke 's consistent errors from 2005 to 2007 , where at every stage he either failed to see the coming storm , or predicted that the trouble would soon end .
Again , I ask Mr. Lucas ,
What would Bernanke have to say for him to be guilty of what his critics accuse ?
Would we have to have Bernanke on tape saying , " I am 100 percent certain that no financial crash will occur " ?
It seems Lucas has set the bar really low for our Fed chairman .
David K. Levine
In an open letter to Paul Krugman , David Levine offers physics as an analogy to exonerate his macro colleagues :
The predictive failure is not a problem of the field — it is a problem for those who are under the impression that we should be able to predict crises .
Do you number yourself in this bunch ?
Do physicists get it wrong because their theory says that they cannot predict where a photon shot through a sufficiently narrow slit will land ?
Economic models are like models of photons going through slits .
Just as those models predict only the statistical distribution of photons , so our models only predict the likelihood of downturns — they do not predict when any particular downturn will occur .
Saying " most economists failed to predict the downturn " is exactly like saying most physicists failed to predict the impact of the twelfth photon passing through the slit .
Anyone familiar with the incredible precision — and experimental confirmation — of the forecasts of quantum physics should recognize the absurdity of Levine 's analogy .
It 's a bit like comparing a Euclidean proof to a closing argument by Johnny Cochrane .
A better analogy for Levine would be a bunch of particle physicists inviting you over to look at their super collider , and then calling you the next week to say they exposed you accidentally to a lethal dose of radiation .
Jeremy Siegel
In a recent WSJ op - ed , Jeremy Siegel defends the honor of the EMH .
Like any fanatic , he manages to transform vice into virtue :
The EMH , originally put forth by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago in the 1960s , states that the prices of securities reflect all known information that impacts their value .
The hypothesis does not claim that the market price is always right .
On the contrary , it implies that the prices in the market are mostly wrong , but at any given moment it is not at all easy to say whether they are too high or too low .
The fact that the best and brightest on Wall Street made so many mistakes shows how hard it is to beat the market .
( emphasis added )
Siegel is to be congratulated for his masterful stroke here .
During the bubble , when investment bankers were earning multimillion - dollar bonuses , the defender of the EMH would have said , " It 's crazy for an average investor to try to beat the market .
Some of the brightest minds in the world have enormous computers and an army of mathematicians at their service , squeezing every ounce of mispricing from the market .
Do n't bother trying to compete with those experts .
Put your money in an index fund instead . "
Yet , after many Austrians ( and others from different schools of thought ) predicted that the market would crash , and that investors should get into cash , Siegel points to the monumentally incompetent investment bankers as proof of the wisdom of " the market . "
William Easterly
I 've saved my favorite for last .
The Queen of England famously asked why none of the economists had seen the crisis coming .
Here 's what William Easterly said in reply :
[ E] conomists did something even better than predict the crisis .
We correctly predicted that we would not be able to predict it .
The most important part of the much - maligned efficient - markets hypothesis ( EMH ) is that nobody can systematically beat the stock market .
Which implies nobody can predict a market crash , because if you could , then you would obviously beat the market .
Now c'mon — that 's just plain funny .
Conclusion
The efficient - markets hypothesis comes in various forms .
There is , indeed , a large empirical literature , in which Fama and others conducted falsifiable tests .
However , as I hope I 've demonstrated with the quotations above , in practice the efficient - markets hypothesis is actually a tautology , or a way of viewing the world .
There 's nothing wrong with using a priori mental frameworks to parse economic reality ; indeed that is one of the defining characteristics of Misesian praxeology .
However , as the quotes show , many of the EMH apologists think they 're independently confirming the EMH , when , in fact , their goggles simply force all evidence into conformity with their presuppositions .
It just keeps getting better and better .
Now we learn that the CRU has admitted to throwing away the primary data on which their climate models were based .
I quote : “ We do not hold the original raw data but only the value - added ( quality controlled and homogenised ) data.â€ 
This means that even the CRU itself has no idea how accidentally corrupt or fraudulently altered its data might be .
And the IPCC reports used the CRU ’s temperature reconstructions as a gold standard .
So did other climatologists all over the world .
And now they ca n’t be verified !
Without a chain of provenance tieing them back to actual measurements , every single figure and trendline in the CRU reconstructions might as well be PDOOMA , a fine old engineering acronym expanding to “ Pulled Directly Out Of My Ass ” .
Words do n’t often fail me , but this is beyond ridiculous .
How could anyone who calls himself a scientist allow the primary data and metadata to be destroyed ?
I ’ve long thought the AGW case was built on sand , but it ’s worse – it ’s built on utter vacuum .
Somebody will have to do the work of collating raw historical data from the weather stations and time periods the CRU mined all over again before we will know anything about the quality of their results .
A significant portion of the climatological literature — everything that used CRU reconstructions or models as an input — will have to be outright scrapped .
While I still think the leaked emails and code make a strong case for active fraud , the scale of this disclosure makes that almost irrelevant .
It is , at the very least , procedural incompetence on a breathtaking scale — the most astounding case of my lifetime , and I ’m hard - put to think of a parallel in the entire history of science .
UPDATE : High drama !
There ’s a strong argument , based on the CRU dump , that the CRU ’s claim to have lost the data in the 1980s has to be a falsehood .
If so , we ’ve moved from an incompetence - centered explanation back to a fraud - centered one .
But then , a counterclaim that the reporting was bad and they ’ve only destroyed 5 % of their data .
Pass the popcorn …
" Let 's see , shall we put money on it , I am going to put money on a Circle being your first train in , " he began , before adding that the train was likely to be empty which meant everybody was likely to get a seat .
The resulting photograph soon found its way on to a South Carolina blog , the Palmetto Scoop , and then on to social media site Mashable , before being sent around the internet in a series of emails and blog posts .

A hiker discovered a body in an abandoned vehicle in an unincorporated area near Milpitas late Friday .
The gender , age and cause of death were not released , pending the outcome of an autopsy early this week , Santa Clara County sheriff 's officials said .
The body was reported at about 5 p.m. Friday near Calaveras Boulevard at Felter Road , but because of poor lighting and rough terrain homicide detectives were unable to investigate until Saturday morning .
The preliminary investigation showed no signs of foul play .
It was unknown how long the body had been in the car , said sheriff 's spokesman Sgt. Rick Sung .
Anyone with information in the case is asked to contact Sgt. Herman Leon or Sgt. Paula McAllister at ( 408 ) 808-4500 or the anonymous tip line at ( 408 ) 808-4431 .
Ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on Friday pulled out of an agreement that was supposed to solve the country 's political crisis , leaving the next moves to voters in a presidential election on Nov. 29 -- and to Latin American leaders who will have to decide whether to accept the winner .
" This deal is dead .
The other side has failed to uphold their end , " said Mr. Zelaya in a radio interview Friday .
His move followed the Honduran Congress 's failure to vote this week on reinstating him .
Mr. Zelaya and the interim government , led by President Roberto Micheletti , agreed a week ago to create a government of national unity and let the country 's Congress decide on the issue of Mr. Zelaya 's return to office , which has been the central issue of the crisis since he was removed on June 28 .
In return , the U.S. , in what was a policy turnaround , said it would recognize this month 's election even if Congress did n't return Mr. Zelaya to power , and would lift economic sanctions Washington had placed on Honduras , one of the hemisphere 's poorest countries .
After Mr. Zelaya 's statement Friday , a U.S. State Department spokesman said the U.S. did n't consider the agreement to be dead .
" Both sides need to return to the table and negotiate the formation of a national unity government , " the spokesman said .

Isaac Newton held a clear glass prism to the sunbeam that penetrated the shutters of his darkened room and watched in awe as the wall of his office danced with all the colours of the rainbow .
The 28 - year - old physicist at Trinity College , Cambridge , was the first to show that white light is a blend of primary colours , a discovery that explains why grass is green and the sky is blue .
His written account of the experiment in 1671 is among the oldest in a collection of scientific milestones described in Letters to the Royal Society , which are made public today to celebrate the 350th anniversary of Britain 's academy of science .
The documents are released through an online library project called Trailblazing , a name inspired by Newton 's famous nod to the work of his predecessors in a note to his rival Robert Hooke : " If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants . "
The letters to the society record the march of science from the earliest blood transfusions , and attempts to capture lightning , to the confirmation of Einstein 's theory of relativity , the discovery of DNA and Stephen Hawking 's first musings on black holes .
The letters reveal a history of failure eclipsed by success , and the maturation of science from a haphazard amateur pursuit to the systematised professionalism of today .
" At that time the only scientists who were in any sense professionals were astronomers and maybe medical doctors , and of the two , the astronomers were the only ones who probably did more good than harm , " said Professor Martin Rees , the astronomer royal and president of the society .
" If you look at these records , you can't help but notice the immense range of interests they had .
They were motivated by curiosity . "
There is the letter from the chemist Robert Boyle , asking the physician Richard Lower about the consequences of transfusing blood from one animal into another .
Does a dog lose its quirks after transfusion and gain those of the donor ?
Does blood from a big dog make a small dog grow ?
Can you safely replace a frog 's blood with blood from a calf , and might that change one species into another ?
The answers were no , no , no and no .
That did not stop Lower moving on to human experiments , paying an " addle - brained " man 20 shillings to receive blood from a lamb .
There were hopes it might cure the man 's mental condition , but when Samuel Pepys , a president of the society , questioned the physician afterwards , Lower noted that his subject was still " a little cracked in the head " .
A letter from Benjamin Franklin from 1752 dispels the myth that lightning is a supernatural force .
He recounts an experiment in Philadelphia that he was lucky to survive , involving a thunderstorm and a kite armed with a long metal spike .
Franklin had a keen eye for the appliance of science .
On witnessing the Montgolfier brothers ' hot air balloon flight , the polymath declared such a device might be strapped to one 's errand boy , so he could hop over hedges more swiftly as he ran from house to house .
Or , Franklin mused , it could carry wine to great altitude and keep it cool .
In 1769 , the English naturalist Daines Barrington wrote to the society after a barrage of tests confirmed that Mozart was indeed a child genius .
Barrington visited the eight - year - old at his parents ' home , and asked him to play scores he had never seen and to compose on the spot .
" His execution was amazing , considering his little fingers could scarcely reach a 5th on the harpsichord , " Barrington wrote on hearing one recital .
He vouched for Mozart 's age , by confirming birth certificate detail and documenting his behaviour .
" Whilst he was playing to me , a favourite cat came in , upon which he immediately left his harpsichord , nor could we bring him back for a considerable time , " he wrote .
" He would also sometimes run about the room with a stick between his legs by way of horse . "
After a safe return to Britain aboard HMS Resolution , Captain James Cook wrote to the Royal Society in 1776 to disclose how he saved his crew from scurvy by filling the hold with " sweet - wort " , sauerkraut , lemons and vegetables .
One sailor died of an unrelated disease .
" Two others were unfortunately drowned , and one killed by a fall ; so of the whole number with which I set out from England I lost only four , " Cook wrote .
Scientific progress brought inevitable clashes with scripture .
The fossilised remains of elephants , tigers , rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses in Kirkdale , Yorkshire , were not washed there by a biblical flood , but showed life on Earth had existed for millions of years , noted the Rev William Buckland in 1822 .
To mark the anniversary , the society is calling leading researchers together to thrash out the biggest issues for modern science .
Feeding the world and providing clean , green energy will doubtless feature , as will more basic questions on the nature of ageing and consciousness .
" Our world is completely transformed through the application of scientific concepts which could not even be conceived of at the time the society was founded , " said Rees .
" New questions come into focus as old ones are answered .
The important thing about science is it's an unending quest . "
The rise of the ' invisible college '
The Royal Society emerged from an " invisible college " of natural philosophers who met in London in the 1640s to discuss the ideas of Francis Bacon .
It became a formal society at Gresham College in November 1660 and included prominent names of the time such as architect Christopher Wren , scientist Robert Boyle and John Wilkins , inventor of the metric system .
The society held weekly meetings where experiments were described or performed before the audience .
In a royal charter of 1663 , the group was officially named as The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge .
It is the world 's oldest scientific academy in continuous existence , with more than 60 Nobel laureates among its 1,400 fellows and foreign members .
Since 1967 , it has occupied a row of buildings overlooking St James 's Park in London .
Every year , the society names 44 scientists as fellows in recognition of their scientific achievements .
The accolade is the highest a scientist can have , short of a Nobel prize .
Existing fellows include neuroscientist Dame Nancy Rothwell , astronomer Jocelyn Bell - Burnell and Cambridge cosmologist Stephen Hawking .

White House aide David Axelrod said President Barack Obama was “ committed ” to allowing the re-importation of pharmaceutical drugs into the U.S. and would push ahead with efforts to open the market .
During debate on the health - care bill , some senators had unsuccessfully sought to attach language that would allow the re-importation of drugs into the U.S. from Canada and other countries .
Obama had endorsed re-importation during the presidential campaign .
“ Let me be clear :
The president supports re-importation , as he said , safe re-importation of drugs into this country , ” Axelrod told CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” on Sunday .
“ There ’s no reason why Americans should pay a premium for the pharmaceuticals that other people in other countries pay less for . ”
LOS ANGELES - One morning in May 2008 , an eighth - grader walked into Janice Hart ’s office at a Beverly Hills middle school crying .
She was upset and humiliated , and could n’t possibly go to class , the girl told the counselor .
The night before , a classmate had posted a video on YouTube with a group of other eighth graders bad - mouthing her , calling her “ spoiled , ’’ a “ brat , ’’ and a “ slut . ’’
Text and instant messages had been flying since .
Half the class must have seen it by now , the girl told Hart .
Hart took the problem to the school ’s vice principal and principal , who took it to a district administrator , who asked the district ’s lawyers what they could do about it .
In the end , citing “ cyber - bullying ’ ’ concerns , school officials suspended the girl who posted the video for two days .
That student took the case to federal court , saying her free speech rights were violated .
Last month , a US District judge in LA sided with the student , saying the school went too far .
Amid rising concerns over cyber - bullying , and even calls for criminalization , some courts , parents , and free speech advocates are pushing back - students , they say , have a First Amendment right to be nasty in cyberspace .
“ To allow the school to cast this wide a net and suspend a student simply because another student takes offense to their speech , without any evidence that such speech caused a substantial disruption of the school ’s activities , runs afoul [ of the law ] , ’’ judge Stephen V. Wilson wrote in a 60 - page opinion .
“ The court can not uphold school discipline of student speech simply because young persons are unpredictable or immature , or because , in general , teenagers are emotionally fragile and may often fight over hurtful comments , ’’ he wrote .
Schools ’ ability to limit student speech is an age - old issue that has been repeatedly tried and tested in the courts , from armbands protesting the Vietnam war to banners promoting marijuana use .
But with teens ’ social lives moving increasingly to cyberspace , where what previously might have been a private bickering is reproduced , publicized and documented for all to see , school officials find themselves on unfamiliar grounds in dealing with e-mails , instant messages , profile pages , videos , and the like that may result in hurt feelings or something more serious .
Free -speech advocates said the notoriety of highly publicized cases , such as the Missouri girl who committed suicide after a mean - spirited MySpace message , have led to schools overreacting and excessively cracking down on student expression when it comes to the Internet .
“ It ’s better to have a lawsuit and lose some money than have a situation where a student commits suicide , ’’ said Eugene Volokh , a First Amendment scholar and law professor at the UCLA who has criticized a bill in Congress that would make cyber bullying punishable by as long as two years in prison .
“ People do n’t appreciate how much the First Amendment protects not only political and ideological speech , but also personal nastiness and chatter .
. . .
If all cruel teasing led to suicide , the human race would be extinct , ’’ Volokh said .
The murkiness of this area of law and educational policy has led to legal challenges across the country over school officials ’ restriction or discipline of student speech .
Attorneys and analysts said court decisions have been “ all over the map ’ ’ on such cases , offering little clarity to confused school administrators .
The US Supreme Court has yet to take up a case involving student speech online ; the governing decision is from the 1969 Tinker v. Des Moines School District case , which held that student speech could not be limited unless it causes substantial disruption on campus .

A Troubling Story of SFPD Bias Against Bicycle Riders
An injured bicyclist is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics on 14th Street and Market Thursday evening after being hit by a driver .
Photos by Bryan Goebel .
Thursday was a momentous day for the growing and diverse population of people who ride bicycles in San Francisco , though as I ’m about to relate to you , the city still has a steep hill to climb , particularly in the San Francisco Police Department .
All day , my job took me to the sites of new bicycle improvements : California ’s first green bike box , the city ’s first physically separated bike lane and bike racks installed on sidewalks .
Although these additions are baby steps toward making the city more bicycle friendly , they are important symbols , and they were roundly cheered by bicycle riders who have been starved for even minimal improvements .
As I coasted eastbound down Market nearing Church on my way home from the Lower Haight last night , I was confronted by a grim picture , the stark reality of life that daily bicycle commuters intimately imagine any time a door is opened into our path , or a vehicle makes an unsuspecting right or left turn without seeing , or caring , that we are riding there .
At the scene , to my left , a woman was lying in the crosswalk on 14th Street , surrounded by paramedics and SFPD officers .
The intersection was illuminated by the flashing red and blue lights of emergency vehicles and patrol units .
My first thought was , " another serious pedestrian injury or fatality in a crosswalk . "
The injured woman , who appeared to be in her 20s , was in fact hit by a northbound
driver in a gray Toyota Camry making an illegal left turn onto 14th Street from
Church , according to a witness .
She was on a bicycle and
the wrecked light - blue 70s Gitane ten-speed , with its crank arms and wheels bent , was resting on a utility pole outside
Trigger .
It was hard to tell , but it appeared as though she had been seriously injured : her head
was in a brace .
The driver , an unidentified woman , remained behind the
wheel , parked in the crosswalk , talking on a cell phone while
paramedics tended to the victim and officers interviewed witnesses .
The injured woman was then loaded
onto a gurney and into the ambulance , where she remained surrounded by
paramedics , and was rushed to the hospital .
The only witness I could find was Carlos Corujo , the owner of the Freewheel Bike Shop in the Mission , who saw the whole thing , with his 3 - year - old niece in his arms .
" I
was walking across the crosswalk and I saw a girl on a bike coming the
other direction and she was hit while the driver was taking a left - hand
turn , " he said .
" I looked at the
light right after the accident just to see who had the right of way ,
for sure , and the bicyclist had the right of way . "
He pointed out that
a sign nearby said it is illegal to make a left turn onto 14th Street .
In fact , there are three signs around the intersection .
The driver remained in her vehicle talking on a cell phone during the investigation .
And now to the very disconcerting part about the police .
As I tried to get information from three SFPD police officers on the scene of the crash , two of them showered me with unadulterated disdain for bicyclists and pedestrians .
One officer said she thought bicyclists and pedestrians are always at fault in crashes and that they are stupid for not watching out for drivers .
She was very upset with cyclists running red lights .
She told me the bicyclist was at fault in this crash without any knowledge that a witness was saying the opposite .
Another officer complained that bicyclists should be ticketed a lot more , then he said that he thought San Francisco bicyclists should all be moved to Treasure Island , where presumably they would n’t be in the way .
Though I deplore the argument made by some that cyclists are second - class citizens or that they face bias and discrimination in a way that resembles African Americans or other people of color in the U.S. , this perverse suggestion by a sworn officer of the law is despicable .
When it dawned on him that his bigotry might make it into my story , given
the bright pink SFPD press badge dangling around my neck , he made a slightly menacing reference to memorizing the information on my pass .
In a follow - up interview today , Corujo said that when he was being interviewed by the officers they seemed to have a preconceived idea of what happened , and were fixated on confirming whether the woman had lights on her bike .
" It seems like they were trying to bias the story to even out the score or something , " said Corujo .
" I do n’t know if they were even listening to the idea that [ the driver ] had made an illegal turn . "
Bicycle riders routinely report this kind of hostile reaction from the people sworn to protect and serve , but when I interviewed San Francisco ’s new police chief ,
George Gascon , a few months ago , I was encouraged that he seemed to be
more open to embracing bicyclists than his predecessor , Heather Fong .
He even promised to go on a bike ride with
Streetsblog , though we ’re still awaiting a firm date .
Even if Chief Gascon ’s approach to enhancing the effectiveness of his police force through Compstat bodes well for the city in certain respects , no amount of data analysis will dispel preconceived notions and prejudice among his personnel .
The bias against bicyclists by some SFPD officers is a deeply endemic
problem on the force that needs to be addressed immediately , especially
as the city is installing more bicycle improvements , and the number of
bicyclists is expected to soar .
I ca n’t help but wonder what the " accident " report from last night is going to say .
I imagine it will fault the bicyclist , despite what Corujo said , and it ’s very likely the driver wo n’t be cited .
Clearly , in the minds of these officers , drivers hold an entitlement to the streets , and bicyclists and pedestrians be damned .
For the sake of the injured woman on 14th and Church and for any cyclist involved in a crash in San Francisco , the San Francisco Police Department must not disregard the rights of anyone , particularly people who choose one form of mobility over another .
All of this was no surprise to Leah Shahum , the executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition .
" It ’s not only deeply disturbing that this bias against bicyclists
still exists within the SF Police Department , but I believe it is
illegal , given the Department ’s responsibility to uphold the law fairly
and without personal bias .
Chief Gascon should make it a priority
to educate his officers and hold them accountable .
Without leadership
from the new Chief , there is no doubt in my mind that bicyclists will
continue to bear the brunt of a dangerously biased police force .
In
this day and age , San Francisco cannot turn a blind eye to this . "
SFPD public affairs returned my phone calls late this afternoon , and was expected to get back to me with a response , and more details on the crash .
Is there any way to use roasted , salted almonds instead of raw almonds ?
I thought about rinsing them in water before putting them to soak .
Kind of like how you shower before you go in the hot tub .
Also , I really wanted to reserve the water for vegetable stock .
I 'm willing to take the squirrel 's risk .
But , outside of earlier arguments , would there be any additional reason for not using almonds that have been heavily processed like the ones I 'm planning on using ?
And I was hoping to use my slow cooker instead of the oven ( less electricity ) .
The only advice I 've found on curing or drying in a slow cooker has come from cannabis - related sites .
I guess it 's reliable , though .
I 'm asking all of this because of this asinine scheme I 've been literally cooking up all week .
If you want to read about it , feel free .
But also feel free not to .
I just typed it to get it out of my system .
Okay .
I 'm hoping this does n't sound stupid .
I 've challenged myself to make a week 's menu plan using a soy - free , gluten - free version of eco-Atkins .
I want to spend less than $ 100 and feed my family of four with three daily meals and an additional snack .
( Eco -Atkins is a high protein diet that relies on plant protein instead of animal protein .
It differs from Atkins in that you are allowed up to 130 net carbs per day -- closer to the " Maintenance " or final phase of Atkins , whereas the initial phase of Atkins keeps net carbs at 20 or less . )
I eat seitan , but just wanted to create a bigger challenge for myself .
I normally keep soy - free because I developed soy sensitivities most likely from overconsumption .
My fault .
I ate soy in every over processed form at every meal .
If I 'd done the same with Stevia , I 'd probably have gotten cancer , too .
( Somewhat kidding .
Just referencing earlier comments about supposedly cancer - causing Stevia .
But only somewhat kidding because who knows how much Stevia I could inhale if left to my own devices .
Any gluttonous consumption can lead to consequences .
And my soya love was gluttonous . )
Anyhow , eco-Atkins has gotton a lot of criticism from vegans just for reminding them of the Atkins diet ( where you can eat an all - you - care - to - eat buffet 's worth of bacon , but need to refrain from the forbidden fruits of carb - ridden apples ) .
Atkins ' loyalists have given the plan criticism because it's not Atkins -y enough ( too many carbs ) , people might think it implies that this version is healthier than their version , and it relies too much on soy and gluten .
And , of course , the usual criticisms about any plan that cuts out an entire food group like dairy , how veganism is too restrictive for people to follow , and any implementation would be too costly .
This is so long because I 'm just so excited !
It was really just a study conducted by David Jenkins , who helped develop the Glycaemic Index .
He was just exploring if vegans could follow the Atkins diet .
He also wanted to see if there were any benefits to relying on plant - based protein as opposed to animal - based protein .
I 'm just doing this to prove something to myself .
I have no idea why .
But I 'm having fun , and that 's all that matters .
And my six - year old daughter acted like the spaghetti squash was magic when we de-seeded and de-pulped " the plant that grows noodles inside of it . "
I avoided calling it a squash , but did say it was in the pumpkin family .
She said " that pumpkin 's cousin is really creative . "
Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , a non-profit group dedicated to defending the freedoms of individuals in the digital age , thinks the U.S. government may be violating the privacy of individuals who post content to Facebook and Twitter .
The organization has filed suit in San Francisco 's U.S. District Court , Northern District , against the Department of Defense , the CIA , the Department of Homeland Security , the Department of Justice , the Department of the Treasury and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in order to get " information concerning the government ’s use of social - networking websites for investigative and data gathering purposes to help inform Congress and the public about the effect of such uses and purposes on citizens ’ privacy rights and associated legal protections . "
According to the complaint , EFF is aware that the government is using content posted to social media sites in their investigations .
After their initial requests for more information and documentation on the specific policies around these activities went unanswered , the EFF began seeking a court order to force the government 's hand in full disclosure .
One of the incidents cited in the complaint was the widely publicized FBI search of an activist 's home , which came after the man in question used radio scanners to post the movements of police on Twitter during the G - 20 Summit .
From the complaint :
" Although the Federal Government clearly uses social - networking websites to collect information , often for laudable reasons , it has not clarified the scope of its use of social - networking websites or disclosed what restrictions and oversight is in place to prevent abuse . "
While it should come as no surprise that the government would be monitoring social media sites for information ( earlier in the year the White House sought to hire a social media archivist , while the CIA invested in a social media monitoring firm ) , it does seem that the EFF has a valid complaint , and that the public should know the scope of the government 's monitoring activities .
The full 8 - page complaint is embedded below .
We 're curious to see how this all plays out , so we 'll keep you posted on new developments .

Modern koalas are known for their cuteness , nearly exclusive eucalyptus - leaf diet , and the unexpectedly weird noises they make .
Now , new research into their ancient ancestors shows that the koalas ' odd appeal arose through the evolutionary interplay between an increasing reliance on an odd food supply and the need to maintain distinct ear structures for hearing each others ' bellows .
By studying the skulls of koala predecessors that lived five to 24 million years ago in the Miocene , an Australian team argues that evolution reshaped the animals faces to enable them to eat the tough leaves while maintaining their specialized communication anatomy .
" The unique cranial configuration of the modern koala is therefore the result of accommodating their masticatory adaptations without compromising their auditory system , " write the researchers , led by Mike Archer , a paleontologist at the University of New South Wales , in a paper in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .
The koalas communicate across the Australian forests by making low - frequency calls that are shockingly uncute ( listen to the embedded video ) .
The upside to the sounds is that they can travel longer distances – they act like the long waves of AM radio instead of the shorter waves of FM .
The researchers hypothesize that the ancient koalas evolved their communication system at a time when the Australian continent was drying out and the koala habitat becoming less dense .
By lowering the frequency of their calls , they were able to maintain communication in the sparser forests .
To hear the lower frequencies , they evolved an ever larger apparatus in the middle ear .
Modern koala bellows can travel more than 2,500 feet .
Meanwhile , as the Miocene wore on , those same forests were increasingly dominated by the eucalyptus , which became the koalas ' main food source .
To make use of that resource , though , they had to add chewing power to deal with the tough leaves .
And it's that combination of evolutionary quirks that yielded the strange skull of Phascolarctos cinereus , the modern koala .

What DNS Is Not
Paul Vixie , Internet Systems Consortium
DNS is many things to many people — perhaps too many things to too many people .
DNS ( Domain Name System ) is a hierarchical , distributed , autonomous , reliable database .
The first and only of its kind , it offers realtime performance levels to a global audience with global contributors .
Every TCP / IP traffic flow including every World Wide Web page view begins with at least one DNS transaction .
DNS is , in a word , glorious .
To underline our understanding of what DNS is , we must differentiate it from what it is not .
The Internet economy rewards unlimited creativity in the monetization of human action , and fairly often this takes the form of some kind of intermediation .
For DNS , monetized intermediation means lying .
The innovators who bring us such monetized intermediation do not call what they sell " lies , " but in this case it walks like a duck and quacks like one , too .
Not all misuses of DNS take the form of lying .
Another frequently seen abuse is to treat DNS as a directory system , which it is not .
In a directory system one can ask approximate questions and get approximate answers .
Think of a printed telephone white pages directory here : users often find what they want in the printed directory not by knowing exactly what the listing is but by starting with a guess or a general idea .
DNS has nothing like that : all questions and all answers are exact .
But DNS has at least two mechanisms that can be misused to support approximate matching at some considerable cost to everybody else , and a lot of that goes on .
Stupid DNS Tricks
The first widespread form of DNS lie was to treat DNS lookups as mapping requests .
CDNs ( content distribution networks ) such as Akamai and Web optimizer products such as Cisco Distributed Director treat incoming DNS lookups as opportunities to direct the activities of Web browsers .
Using the IP source address of a DNS request , these products and services try to guess the proximity of the requester to each of many replicated content servers .
Based on the measured load of each content server 's system and network , and on an estimate of each content server 's proximity to that requester , a DNS response is crafted to direct that requester to the closest or best content server for that URI domain .
Problems abound from this approach , but none affects the CDN operator 's revenue .
First and foremost it is necessary to defeat or severely limit caching and reuse of this policy - based data ( " DNS lies " ) .
Caching and reuse , which once were considered essential to the performance and scalability of DNS , would allow a policy - based response intended for requester A also to be seen by requester B , which might not otherwise receive the same answer — for example , when server loads have changed and there 's a new balance .
The effects of this noncaching are a higher DNS request rate ( perhaps leading to higher revenue for CDNs that charge by the transaction ) and more network load for access - side networks and a slightly higher floor for average transaction time .
Furthermore , it has never been wise to assume that a DNS request 's IP source address gives any hint of an end - system Web browser 's network location .
This is because DNS requests heard by a CDN come from recursive DNS servers as a result of cache misses ; they do not come from end systems themselves .
Some ISPs regionalize their recursive name servers , allowing CDNs to encode rules improving the quality of their estimates .
Many recursive name servers are per-country or per-continent or even per-hemisphere , however , so it 's always necessary for a CDN to deploy well - connected supernodes , and these always end up hearing a lot of out - of - region requests .
The primary benefit of a CDN is the same as gimmick - free outsourcing : it gives a content owner somebody to sue if things do n't go well .
That DNS system performance and stability has to pay the price for such liability shielding is at best unfortunate .
Given that a CDN still requires supernodes that will hear many out - of - region requests , a gimmick - free approach here would be to answer DNS truthfully and let existing pseudorandom distribution mechanisms do their work .
Noting that there is no patent on the existing pseudorandomization technologies and that nobody ever got fired for buying a CDN , we can expect to see ever - more content distributed this way in the decades to come .
NXDOMAIN Remapping
Fairly often , as in millions of times per second worldwide , somebody looks up a domain name in DNS that is n't there .
Maybe this is a user at a Web browser making a typographical error , or maybe there 's a broken link on a Web site , or maybe a hardware or software error is causing nonexistent names to go into DNS requests .
One way or another , the answer is generally supposed to be NXDOMAIN ( sometimes written as RCODE=3 ) .
These negative answers are cacheable , as is any other kind of DNS information , since DNS is designed to express truth , not policy .
A network application ( perhaps a Web browser , or mail server , or indeed anything at all that uses TCP / IP flows to do its business ) that gets back one of these negative responses is supposed to treat it as an error and reject its own underlying work item that led to this lookup .
For a Web browser , rejection takes the form of an " error page . "
For a mail server , rejection takes the place of " bounced e-mail . "
Every TCP / IP application , large or small , new or old , knows how to cope with NXDOMAIN .
The World Wide Web has changed the rules .
Though the Web is young — and though the Internet was here before the Web and will be here after the Web and is much larger than the Web — the fact remains that the Web is what end users are looking at .
Advertisers have a whole language to describe the value of end users , with words such as " impressions , " " click - throughs , " and " eyeballs . "
Why on earth , these advertisers ask , would you ever send back an NXDOMAIN if an impression was possible ?
So it is , increasingly , that in place of the NXDOMAIN your application knows how to handle , if you ask for a name that does not exist , you 'll get a positive ( deceptive ; false ; lying ) answer that your application also knows how to handle .
For example , if I ask my own recursive name server for a name that does not exist , it will tell me NXDOMAIN .
If I ask OpenDNS 's recursive name server for a name that does not exist , it will send me a NOERROR response with an answer pointing at an advertising server .
Note that I 'm using OpenDNS as a convenient example ; it did not invent this technique .
Indeed , Nominum and other DNS vendors now sell an add - on to their recursive name service products to allow any ISP in the world to do this , and a growing number of ISPs are doing it .
Why so many ?
Simply because whoever remaps these NXDOMAIN responses gets the impression revenue .
There are unverified claims that some ISPs are blocking access to OpenDNS and / or all non-ISP name servers in order to force their customers to use the ISP 's own name server .
I say unverified , but I find the claims credible — ISPs have wafer - thin margins and if they see this kind of manna going out the door , they can't just let it happen .
To demonstrate the extreme desire to capture this revenue , a true story : a few years ago VeriSign , which operates the .COM domain under contract to ICANN ( Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ) , added a " wild card " to the top of the .COM zone ( *. COM ) so that its authoritative name servers would no longer generate NXDOMAIN responses .
Instead they generated responses containing the address of SiteFinder 's Web site — an advertising server .
The outcry from the community ( including your humble narrator ) was loud and long , and before ICANN had a chance to file a lawsuit to stop this nonsense , many people had patched their recursive name servers to remap any response from a .COM name server that was not a delegation ( for example , telling how to find the GOOGLE .
COM name servers ) back into an NXDOMAIN .
Some ISPs put logic into their policy - based routers to turn SiteFinder responses into pointers to the ISP 's own advertising server instead .
Damage Control
NXDOMAIN was n't designed to be a revenue hook — many applications depend on accurate error signals from DNS .
For example , consider the " same origin trust model " used for Web cookies .
If you 're holding a cookie for GOOGLE .COM and you can be fooled into following a link to KJHSDFKJHSKJHMJHER .
GOOGLE .COM , and the resulting NXDOMAIN response is remapped into a positive answer to some advertising server , then you 're going to send your cookie to that advertising server when you send your HTTP GET request there .
Not such a bad thing for a GOOGLE .
COM cookie , but a real problem for a BANKOFAMERICA .COM cookie .
( Thanks to Dan Kaminsky for telling me about the " same origin trust model " problem . )
Remapping could also cause e-mail to be captured if an MX ( mail exchanger ) request is captured in this way .
Many NXDOMAIN remappers try to avoid this by triggering only on A ( address ) requests , but to make this work they have to turn off caching , since NXDOMAINs are not type specific and since an SMTP initiator will fall back to type =A if it gets no answer from type =MX .
Similar protections ( designed to keep lawsuits away while still attracting revenue ) include the idea of triggering the remapping logic only if the query domain begins with WWW . — but as far as I know there are a lot of typographical errors beginning WW. , or ending with .CM , so I do not hold out a lot of hope for it long term .
Too much money is involved , and nobody wants to leave it on the table ( where in this case it belongs ) .
Standard Bad Practices
There is at the time of this writing an IETF draft ( think : proto - RFC ) on the Recommended Configuration and Use of DNS Redirect by Service Providers .
The goal of this document is to present some rules for how DNS lies should be delivered in order to give all the vendors and operators in this growing market a common frame of service .
Some Luddites may feel that the " standard best practice " in this area is simply not to do it at all , but this being unrealistic , we now face standards action .
As a standard feature of DNS technology we can expect a day to come when all DNS services are delivered this way and our kids think of end - to - end DNS the way they think of eight - track tapes .
This document makes a substantial contribution to the debate around this feature area by suggesting that opt - out for this service should be a network layer attribute ( in other words , associated with one 's Ethernet [ MAC ] address or equipment port number ) and not a transport layer attribute .
Noting that as with any other kind of information , spam opt - out is not as good for the economy as opt - in , it 's valuable to the debate that this IETF draft 's authors have said that Web cookies are n't good enough .
Others may disagree but at least this point is now on the table .
This document also talks about " legally mandated " DNS redirection , which is exactly the nightmare it sounds like it is and which we can all hope becomes a historical curiosity as rapidly as possible .
The absolutely best part of this IETF draft is Section 10 ( DNSSEC Considerations ) , which ends as follows :
" So the only case where DNS security extensions cause problems for DNS Redirect is with a validating stub resolver .
This case does n't have widespread deployment now and could be mitigated by using trust anchor , configured by the applicable ISP or DNS ASP , that could be used to sign the redirected answers .
As noted above in Section 9.7 , such improper redirection of valid responses may also cause DNSSEC trust verification problems . "
A Rescue Being Thought Of
Fifteen years ago a bunch of ivory tower theoreticians got together at IETF and said , " Let 's secure DNS . "
The threat model has evolved over time , and now this set of protocol enhancements ( DNSSEC ) is more or less ready for deployment and more or less allows for the possibility that DNS liars will be caught and ignored .
Noting that DNSSEC has taken too long and is a committee - based horror in its inelegance and complexity , here 's how it 's supposed to work and how it may help curtail the current market in DNS lies .
In DNS , data producers are the authoritative name servers , each of which is the delegated authority for one or more zones .
For today , think of a DNS zone as everything at or below a certain name , so , for example , WWW .
GOOGLE .COM is in the GOOGLE .COM zone .
DNSSEC allows these zones to be signed and verified using public - key cryptography .
The private ( signing ) key is used by the editor of the zone to generate signature records for each set of real records .
The public key is used by recursive name servers to verify that the data they receive was signed by the holder of the corresponding private key .
Public ( verification ) keys are published using DNS itself , by including each zone 's key in the zone 's parent zone — so the public key for the GOOGLE .
COM zone is published in the COM zone and so on .
I 'm deliberately skipping a long and unpleasant story about where the public key for COM is supposed to be published , since it 's not germane to this article .
In theory , an end - system owner who does n't like being lied to can work cooperatively with zone editors who do n't like their zones getting lied about if each of them deploys DNSSEC .
An application that is supposed to receive an NXDOMAIN but that today receives a pointer to an advertising server would in a DNSSEC world receive a " signature not present " error .
This would be an error because DNSSEC has a way to inform a validator that a signature should have been present .
Note that in the vast majority of cases zone editors do n't care whether their zones are being lied about , and , therefore , DNSSEC will remain silent most of the time .
Consider also that this was not the original DNSSEC threat model ; we really thought we had to stop on - the - wire corruption such as that discovered by Dan Kaminsky in 2008 , and the idea of stopping in - the - middlebox corruption such as NXDOMAIN remapping really is just gravy .
DNSSEC will complicate life for CDN providers using Stupid DNS Tricks , but it wo n't end that war since it 's still possible to sign every policy - based answer and keep all the answers and signatures available , and still send different answers to the same question based on requester identity and policy , and have the signatures all be perfectly valid .
DNSSEC will also complicate life for sysadmins and application developers .
We ( ISC — the BIND people ) are doing what we can to improve on that in BIND9 9.7 ( due out by December 2009 ) , and there are plenty of other service and technology providers in the space as well .
The killer app for DNSSEC will be a Web browser and Web server that can authenticate to each other without using X.509 ( volunteers are hereby encouraged to get together and try to make that happen ) .
Directory Services
Browser implementers including Microsoft and Mozilla have begun doing DNS queries while collecting URIs from their graphical front end in order to do fancy " auto - completion . "
This means that during the typing time of a URI such as http://www.cnn.com/, the browser will have asked questions such as W , WW , WWW , WWW.C , WWW.CN , WWW.CNN , and so on .
It 's not quite that bad , since the browsers have a precompiled idea of what the top - level domains are .
They wo n't actually ask for WWW.C , for example , but they are now asking for WWW.CN , which is in China , and WWW.
CNN.CO , which is in Colombia .
Although one simple - sounding solution is for Microsoft and Firefox to buy some name - server hardware and network links for China and Colombia ( and no doubt many other affected top - level domain operators ) , that wo n't stop the information leak or remove this stupid and useless traffic from the rest of the network .
Since the truly best solution is , as usual , stop doing this stupid thing — and we all know that is n't going to happen — perhaps this behavior can be made optional , and then we can just argue about what the default ( opt - in vs. opt - out ) should be .
This is the first time in the history of DNS that someone has used it prospectively , to find out if what has been typed is or is n't a valid domain name , in order to support something like auto - completion .
As in so many other novel uses of DNS , this is not what it was designed for .
Had DNS been designed with this kind of thing in mind , one of the ways we would be able to tell is that domain names would be written from highest - to lowest - order term ( COM.CNN.WWW ) .
This would allow partial name completion just as happens in graphical file system browsers .
Absent a complete redesign , which wo n't happen in our lifetime because of the size and usefulness of the installed base , all we can do is ask browser implementers to be smarter and prepare for more DNS traffic on our networks .
Conclusion
What DNS is not is a mapping service or a mechanism for delivering policy - based information .
DNS was designed to express facts , not policies .
Because it works so well and is ubiquitous , however , it 's all too common for entrepreneurs to see it as a greenfield opportunity .
Those of us who work to implement , enhance , and deploy DNS and to keep the global system of name servers operating will continue to find ways to keep the thing alive even with all these innovators taking their little bites out of it .
These are unhappy observations and there is no solution within reach because of the extraordinary size of the installed base .
The tasks where DNS falls short , but that people nevertheless want it to be able to do , are in most cases fundamental to the current design .
What will play out now will be an information war in which innovators who muscle in early enough and gain enough market share will prevent others from doing likewise — DNS lies vs. DNS security is only one example .

Modern Warfare 2 is no longer available in Russia for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners , it seems , despite the game hitting store shelves as scheduled early last week .
Noticed by fan site Hellforge on Friday , Russian game site GotPS3 claims Russian officials had threatened to ban the game , prompting retailers to yank copies from store shelves and distributors to shut down the outflow of new stock .
Apparently the thematic content of the controversial " No Russian " level in which players must choose whether to fire on innocent civilians in a Moscow airport managed to escape broad public notice before launch .
It 's not clear whether the threatened governmental ban came about because of the level 's play mechanics ( the compulsion to shoot and terrorize innocent civilians ) or the fact that you play a CIA agent pretending to be a Russian ultranationalist pretending to be an American terrorist .
Presumably someone 's decided Russia comes off looking badly , and that America comes off looking nobler - than - thou ( albeit , per the level in question , pretty single - minded about it ) .
GotPS3 writes that the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions will be recalled and replaced by Infinity Ward / Activision with a version that does n't contain the airport level in " 10 - 20 days , " and that both the retail and digitally distributed ( read : Steam - only ) PC version has been patched to remove the level entirely , thus allowing the game 's continued sales .
I 've dropped Activision a note requesting clarification on the issue .

Michigan universities should n't be able to pick and choose which constitutional amendments apply to them - and that includes the right to bear arms , a state senator from Monroe County says .
" Universities should n't be allowed to choose what parts of the constitution they think are good enough for them or not , " said Sen .
Randy Richardville , R- Monroe , whose district includes southern Washtenaw County .
" It would be tantamount to saying illegal search and seizure can be allowed on a college campus . "
George Mason University student and former active duty Marine Andrew Dysart stands on the George Mason campus with an empty holster in Fairfax , Va .
In the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings , Dysart is advocated the right of students with concealed handgun permits to carry guns on campus for protection .

Richardville sponsored Senate Bill 747 , which would give universities the discretion - but not force them - to allow individuals with permits to carry concealed guns in classrooms and dormitories .
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony on the bill earlier this month , but took no action and wo n't meet again until Jan 1 .
That legislation has prompted talk ofÂ revising Richardville 's bill to eliminate all designated gun-free zones - including theaters , stadiums , hospitals , classrooms and dormitories , said State Sen .
Wayne Kuipers , R- Holland , chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" The testimony was mixed and sparked a broad debate , " Kuipers said .
" There 's discussion now on whether or not Michigan should eliminate all its gun-free zones . "
Currently , the local boards that govern Michigan 's universities and community colleges can pass policies on whether guns are allowed - carried by a concealed weapon license holder or otherwise - on campus .
State law bans the institutions from allowing guns in gun- free zones such as classrooms , dormitories and stadiums .
SB 747 would remove classrooms and dormitories from that list .
Michigan State University is the only of the state 's 15 public universities to allow concealed pistol license holders to bring firearms on campus , except for the banned areas .
Southwestern Michigan College is the only of 28 community colleges in that allows the same .
Richardville said beyond the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , the Michigan Constitution dictates individuals have " a right to keep and bear arms for the defense of himself and the state . "
Officials from Washtenaw Community College , the University of Michigan and Eastern Michigan University have condemned legislation that would allow concealed permit holders to carry anywhere on campus .
To obtain a concealed weapons permit , a person must be a 21 years old , a U.S. citizen and a Michigan resident for at least six months , with some exceptions .
Applicants must have a record clear of various crimes , a clean bill of mental health and complete a safety training course .
" One of the things that came up were the shootings down in Virginia Tech , " Richardville said .
" The professor in that class was a CPL holder .
His university did not allow him , because of a no - gun rule , to have his concealed with him .
It was in his car , in the parking lot locked up .
He was murdered and so were 31 other people . "
Lobbyists from the Michigan Community Colleges Association and the Presidents Council , State Universities of Michigan , testified against the bill .
" Nobody is intending to violate someone 's national constitutional rights , " said Michael Hansen , president of the MCCA .
" On the other hand , we want to be able to recognize that all of those rights come with certain natural restrictive conditions . "
And local boards should have control over student conduct on their campuses , Hansen said .
A separate measure that would also change laws regulating guns on campus , House Bill 5474 , is now waiting in a House committee , where one of its sponsors , Rep. Joel Sheltrown , D - West Branch , says it will stay while he educates the public about what the bill really does .
The House measure would allow concealed pistol license holders to have guns on roads , sidewalks , green space and other open spaces on campus , but not in closed campus spaces like museums , student unions , dormitories or classrooms .
The bills have sparked debate on local college campuses .
At U - M , the Michigan Student Assembly passed a resolution condemning the HB 5474 .
" Having concealed weapons on campus is not something we endorse , " MSA President Abhishek Mahanti said .
The majority of students who spoke about the bills at a November panel discussion at EMUÂ opposed changing laws to allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry guns on campus .
Sheltrown said he 's been inundated with e-mails in recent months , and most of them either opposed the bill or confused the House bill with one that would allow guns everywhere on campus .
" If the public has concerns , we can slow this process down and address those concerns to make sure everyone understands , " he said .
" This could be a very long process . "
And not all students oppose the measures . Â
U -M history senior Julian Lizzio is a member of Students for Concealed Carry , a volunteer group of activists that supports expanding gun rights on college campuses .
It has 42,000 members on its Facebook page .
" Our group supports allowing qualified individuals with concealed pistol licenses to do on campus what they do everywhere else , " Lizzio said .
" We do n't think campus is a special place where you are automatically safer by not having a gun .
We want the same rights that apply everywhere else to apply while we 're at a school . "

The " Arbeit macht frei " sign stolen from Auschwitz in southern Poland has been found in the north and five men are being questioned by police .
The five suspects , aged in their 20s and 30s , were not members of a neo - Nazi group , Krakow police said .
The metal sign from the main gate , which symbolises for many the atrocities of Nazi Germany , had been cut into three pieces , they added .
A major search was launched after the sign was stolen before dawn on Friday .
This symbol , probably one of the most important of the past century , can be put back in its place
Pawel Sawicki
Spokesman for Auschwitz museum
Sign of death and defiance Viewpoint :
Why sign is irreplaceable Andrzej Rokita , the local police chief in Krakow - where the men were being questioned - said the theft had been financially motivated , and it remained unclear whether it was carried out to order .
" From the information we have , none of the five belong to a neo - Nazi group nor hold such ideas , " Andrzej Rokita said of the suspects .
' Enormous relief '
The sign 's theft had caused outrage in Israel and among Polish politicians .
The sign has been cut into three pieces , police say More than a million people - 90 % of them Jews - were murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz during World War II .
Pawel Sawicki , a spokesman for Auschwitz museum , said the recovery of the sign was an " enormous relief " .
" We are extremely grateful to the police who have done fantastic work , " he told AFP news agency .
" This symbol , probably one of the most important of the past century , can be put back in its place . "
The museum is preparing to celebrate the 65th anniversary of Auschwitz - Birkenau 's liberation by Soviet troops on 27 January .
Scrap metal yards searched Police had stepped up security checks at airports and border crossings and searched scrap metal yards over the weekend in their hunt for the 5 m ( 16ft ) sign , which translates as " Work sets you free " .
The sign has been restored since the camp was liberated in 1945
" We have arrested five men aged from 20 to 39 in the north of Poland , " said Krakow police spokesman Dariusz Nowak .
" They were picked up shortly before midnight and the sign was found in a house , " he added without giving further details .
The wrought - iron sign was half - unscrewed , half - torn off from above the death camp 's gate between 0330 and 0500 on Friday .
Investigators said at least two people would have been needed to steal the 40kg ( 90 lb ) sign .
Auschwitz museum spokesman Jaroslaw Mensfelt said the thieves had apparently carried the sign 300 m ( 328 yards ) to an opening in a concrete wall .
The opening was left intentionally to preserve a poplar tree dating back to the time of World War II .
Four metal bars that blocked the opening had been cut and footprints in the snow led from the wall opening to the nearby road , where police presume the sign was loaded on to a vehicle .

A creative plan to help wounded veterans and their exhausted families adapt to the strain of long - term home care is on the brink of bipartisan approval  but for the familiar obstructionism of Senator Tom Coburn .
This is one of the most deplorable displays by the lawmaker - physician , an Oklahoma Republican who relishes playing the self - styled budget hawk by putting attention - grabbing holds on crucial legislation .
The urgently needed legislation consolidates more than a dozen improvements in veterans ’ health care  most notably a new assistance program for family members who wind up providing lifelong home nursing to severely disabled veterans .
These vital caregivers  who sacrifice careers and put huge strains on their own mental health  assume an obligation “ that ultimately belongs to the government , ” Senator Daniel Akaka , the bill ’s chief sponsor , properly notes .
The measure also expands benefits for women veterans who suffered sexual trauma on duty , extends veterans ’ care in rural areas , tightens quality control at V.A. hospitals , and ensures that catastrophically disabled veterans will not be charged for emergency services in community hospitals .
The omnibus legislation drew unanimous committee approval .
But Senator Coburn objected to quick floor passage , demanding that the five - year , $ 3.7 billion cost be offset with immediate budget cuts .
The senator ’s argument rings hollow in the face of veterans ’ suffering and the world of deficit budgeting brought on by his party ’s tax cuts and zealous war investments .
Be grateful there is a comic here because Tony spent his weekend in a fireplace while Wes contemplated the consequences of being on the naughty list .

The world is much closer to running out of oil than official estimates admit , according to a whistleblower at the International Energy Agency who claims it has been deliberately underplaying a looming shortage for fear of triggering panic buying .
The senior official claims the US has played an influential role in encouraging the watchdog to underplay the rate of decline from existing oil fields while overplaying the chances of finding new reserves .
The allegations raise serious questions about the accuracy of the organisation 's latest World Energy Outlook on oil demand and supply to be published tomorrow – which is used by the British and many other governments to help guide their wider energy and climate change policies .
In particular they question the prediction in the last World Economic Outlook , believed to be repeated again this year , that oil production can be raised from its current level of 83 m barrels a day to 105 m barrels .
External critics have frequently argued that this cannot be substantiated by firm evidence and say the world has already passed its peak in oil production .
Now the " peak oil " theory is gaining support at the heart of the global energy establishment .
" The IEA in 2005 was predicting oil supplies could rise as high as 120 m barrels a day by 2030 although it was forced to reduce this gradually to 116 m and then 105 m last year , " said the IEA source , who was unwilling to be identified for fear of reprisals inside the industry .
" The 120 m figure always was nonsense but even today 's number is much higher than can be justified and the IEA knows this .
" Many inside the organisation believe that maintaining oil supplies at even 90 m to 95 m barrels a day would be impossible but there are fears that panic could spread on the financial markets if the figures were brought down further .
And the Americans fear the end of oil supremacy because it would threaten their power over access to oil resources , " he added .
A second senior IEA source , who has now left but was also unwilling to give his name , said a key rule at the organisation was that it was " imperative not to anger the Americans " but the fact was that there was not as much oil in the world as had been admitted .
" We have [ already ] entered the ' peak oil ' zone .
I think that the situation is really bad , " he added .
The IEA acknowledges the importance of its own figures , boasting on its website : " The IEA governments and industry from all across the globe have come to rely on the World Energy Outlook to provide a consistent basis on which they can formulate policies and design business plans . "
The British government , among others , always uses the IEA statistics rather than any of its own to argue that there is little threat to long - term oil supplies .
The IEA said tonight that peak oil critics had often wrongly questioned the accuracy of its figures .
A spokesman said it was unable to comment ahead of the 2009 report being released tomorrow .
John Hemming , the MP who chairs the all - party parliamentary group on peak oil and gas , said the revelations confirmed his suspicions that the IEA underplayed how quickly the world was running out and this had profound implications for British government energy policy .
He said he had also been contacted by some IEA officials unhappy with its lack of independent scepticism over predictions .
" Reliance on IEA reports has been used to justify claims that oil and gas supplies will not peak before 2030 .
It is clear now that this will not be the case and the IEA figures cannot be relied on , " said Hemming .
" This all gives an importance to the Copenhagen [ climate change ] talks and an urgent need for the UK to move faster towards a more sustainable [ lower carbon ] economy if it is to avoid severe economic dislocation , " he added .
The IEA was established in 1974 after the oil crisis in an attempt to try to safeguard energy supplies to the west .
The World Energy Outlook is produced annually under the control of the IEA 's chief economist , Fatih Birol , who has defended the projections from earlier outside attack .
Peak oil critics have often questioned the IEA figures .
But now IEA sources who have contacted the Guardian say that Birol has increasingly been facing questions about the figures inside the organisation .
Matt Simmons , a respected oil industry expert , has long questioned the decline rates and oil statistics provided by Saudi Arabia on its own fields .
He has raised questions about whether peak oil is much closer than many have accepted .
A report by the UK Energy Research Centre ( UKERC ) last month said worldwide production of conventionally extracted oil could " peak " and go into terminal decline before 2020 – but that the government was not facing up to the risk .
Steve Sorrell , chief author of the report , said forecasts suggesting oil production will not peak before 2030 were " at best optimistic and at worst implausible " .
But as far back as 2004 there have been people making similar warnings .
Colin Campbell , a former executive with Total of France told a conference : " If the real [ oil reserve ] figures were to come out there would be panic on the stock markets … in the end that would suit no one . "

President Obama ’s visit to China this week inevitably invites comparisons between the world ’s two leading powers .
You know what they say : Britain owned the 19th century , America owned the 20th century , and , it ’s all but certain that China will own the 21st century .
Maybe , but I ’m not ready to cede the 21st century to China just yet .
Why not ?
It has to do with the fact that we are moving into a hyperintegrated world in which all aspects of production  raw materials , design , manufacturing , distribution , fulfillment , financing and branding  have become commodities that can be accessed from anywhere by anyone .
But there are still two really important things that ca n’t be commoditized .
Fortunately , America still has one of them : imagination .
What your citizens imagine now matters more than ever because they can act on their own imaginations farther , faster , deeper and cheaper than ever before  as individuals .
In such a world , societies that can nurture people with the ability to imagine and spin off new ideas will thrive .
The Apple iPod may be made in China , but it was dreamed up in America , and that ’s where most of the profits go .
America  with its open , free , no-limits , immigrant - friendly society  is still the world ’s greatest dream machine .
Who would cede a century in which imagination will have such a high value to an authoritarian society that controls its Internet and jails political prisoners ?
Remember what Grandma used to say : Never cede a century to a country that censors Google .
The spacious manicured streets of the illegal Israeli settlement Kiryat Arba .
I ’ve been to al - Khalil a number of times .
I ’m intentionally using the Arabic name for the city because every time I ’ve visited it has been to the areas populated by Palestinians .
I ’ve visited on my own , with Palestinian friends and with the Christian Peacemaker Team ( CPT ) who maintain a presence in the old city .
Every visit is a new lesson in the occupation .
Today for the first time I visited Hebron rather then al - Kahlil ; the streets where Palestinians cannot drive and sometimes cannot walk and the illegal settlements of Kiryat Arba on the periphery of the city and the inner city illegal settlements of Beit Hadassah and Tel Rumeida with B’tselem an Israeli human rights organization .
Driving to Hebron from Jerusalem was mind blowing .
Living in Bethlehem I associate “ going to Israel ” with a combination of checkpoints and slow public transport .
This is not the case if you are Israeli or traveling with Israeli ’s and are going to the West Bank .
Driving from Jerusalem into the West Bank was seamless .
We got all the way to Hebron and unless you knew what you were looking for there was nothing , no signs or road changes that would tell let you know that you had entered the West Bank .
We entered the old city of Hebron through the illegal settlement of Kiryat Arba .
I know I am probably annoying you , maybe even alienating you , by prefacing all of these settlements with illegal but I do n’t have a choice .
International law and foreign consensus is pretty unanimous on this point .
Israeli settlements within the occupied Palestinian territories , including East Jerusalem , are illegal .
Traveling by private car or bus from Bethlehem the last part of the journey into the old city is always a set of narrow busy streets .
Not so coming in through the settlement , it was easy to drive our huge tour bus right up to the convenient parking lot outside of the Ibrahimi Mosque / Cave of Machpelah .
Hebron is one of the largest Palestinian cities , home to 250,000 Palestinians .
As part of the “ Road Map to Peace ” coming out of the Oslo Accords Hebron was supposed to be gradually turned over to Palestinian Authorities .
As a step towards this in 1997 , the city was divided into two parts – H1 and H2 .
The Palestinian Authority would control H1 , and H2 would remain under Israeli military control .
H2 is home to 25,000 Palestinians , 500 - 800 illegal settlers ( should n’t we be a bit worried that no one will confirm the exact number ) and at any given time around 1,000 Israeli soldiers .
Check out this link for more information about Hebron including excellent maps : http://www.btselem.org/english/Hebron/Index.asp.
These numbers are bit misleading though .
While there are only 500 - 800 settlers in the four settlements located in the old city of Hebron , the illegal settlement of Kiryat Arba is perched right outside Hebron and flows seamlessly into the old city .
Kiryat Arba is home to 7,000 settlers and is part of the Gush Etzion settlement bloc .
This large settlement bloc falls within Area C from the Oslo Accords , which is an area of land covering some 60 % of the West Bank and is under complete Israeli control .
When you look at the Hebron settlements in this larger context they appear not as wild outposts but as a continuous part of a larger colonial settlement system .
In H2 Israeli settlers are subject , as citizens of Israel to Israeli civil law , their Palestinian neighbors , as an occupied population , are subject to Israeli military law .
The apartheid street system in Hebron , Palestinians can only walk to the right of the concrete barrier while israelis and internationals are free to walk or drive in the wider left lane .
Walking within through the parts of H2 Hebron that are not illegal settlements was a heart wrenching mixture of post - war zone and ghetto .
The former Palestinian markets were vacant , crumbling and desecrated with racist anti-Arab propaganda .
There were posters of “ Israel ” that showed it occupying large chunks of Jordan , Syria , Lebanon and Egypt .
Palestinians unlucky enough to live in this area are subject to the worst living conditions I ’ve seen in the West Bank .
You ca n’t tell me this is not apartheid when Palestinians have fenced off lanes for walking .
When Israeli settlers are allowed to drive cars on a street Palestinians can only walk down .
When on certain streets Palestinians have to turn right , if they continue straight they will be arrested .
When settlers can carry guns .
In the settlement of Beit Haddash we met with David Wilder .
The name should be familiar to some of you .
David is the “ spokesman ” for the illegal settler community in Hebron .
A native of New Jersey , David has a degree in education a great Jersey accent and a leather jacket .
He showed us around the settlement ’s museum , a series of dark rooms with exhibits meant to establish a continuous Jewish history in Hebron and persecution of Jews ( highlighted by the killing by Palestinians in 1929 of 67 members of the tiny , 500 - 700 out of a city of 20,000 , Jewish community of Hebron during the early stages of the Zionist movement within historic Palestine )
A former open air market now completely off limits to Palestinians .
David Wilder will not use the word Palestine or Palestinians .
He refers to his Palestinian neighbors categorically as Arabs .
Their lack of equal rights is to him , simply “ the price of war ” a phrase he repeated often .
His line is that since “ the Arabs ” , all of them evidently in consensus ( even Ben Gurion ’s own diaries show this to be a lie , Israel was the undoubtedly the aggressor in 48 ) decided to attack Israeli in 48 and 67 and lost , they deserve what they get .
Of course Israel as a benevolent nation has tried to give them “ gifts ” , he was n’t clear as to the exact nature of these “ gifts ” , but “ the Arabs ” wo n’t shut up and graciously accept so what is to be done ?
He very clearly tried to build up Iran as a threat and link Iran to Palestinians .
The kicker for me though was when he framed the illegal settlements in Hebron as something , which is widely accepted throughout the world , civil disobedience .
The irony of a man with a gun on his hip , part of a community that routinely physically and verbally abuses their Palestinian neighbors and their children ( Please check out the photos and videos at B’tslem , CPT and even the NYTimes for examples of this ) calling their actions civil disobedience was hard to stomach .
I had a very visceral reaction to visiting the settlements ; fear , for myself and Palestinians and outrage , the kind I always feel when people try to put a PR spin on injustice .
However , that is not enough analysis .
I ’m not writing this to tell you that the illegal settlers deep inside of the 1967 green line are a bit off - kilter .
You know that already , or you should .
It was the Palestinian counterpart to the tour , Issa , who helped put the settler phenomenon in context .
He met us the end of Shuhada Street .
As a Palestinian he was not allowed to walk any farther to meet our group .
So you just met with David Wilder ?
He asked after welcoming us .
Yeah we mumbled warily
Did he show you his gun ?
Issa continued .
Which is really the perfect question to highlight the hypocrisy of a man who plays himself off as just this regular Jersey guy who hopes for a good life for his family and justice for his people .
And Wilder as you can see if you goggle him does indeed wear a gun or at least poses for pictures with one prominently displayed on his hip .
You know , Issa said at the end or our tour ( and I ’m not quoting directly but basing this on my notes ) David Wilder talked a lot about the Massacre in 1929 , right ?
It was a horrible thing that happened to those Jewish families he said .
Did he talk about the 19 Palestinian families who took Jewish families into their homes to protect them .
By some accounts over 400 Jews were sheltered by their Palestinian neighbors .
My wife ’s relatives were one of those families , that Palestinian family living in a cage up near Tel Rumeida , they were one of those families .
We have more of a connection to the Jewish community in Hebron then David Wilder does as an American from New Jersey .
Yet we live under terrible conditions and he moves freely with a gun on his hip .
All of this is very true of course but nothing revelatory .
But what he said next helped to remind me of the larger perspective and get past my own disgust .
I do n’t hold the settlers responsible for this he said .
This is not the settler ’s fault .
This is the fault of the Israeli State , they use the settlers as a political tool .
Most of the new settlers now he said , they ’re no religious fanatics , they ’re poor people from Russia and now even from India .
They do n’t know that they are going to end up in this situation .
And I think this is an incredibly important point to remember .
The settlers may or may not be crazy .
But they do not have control over the Israeli state .
Israel removed 8,000 illegal settlers from Gaza in less then two weeks .
If there are settlers in Hebron , in the West Bank they are there because they serve a political purpose for Israel domestically and internationally .
They are there because Israel wants them there .
If the Israeli state did not want them there , they would not be there .
When we reduce any aspect of the occupation to the rational or irrational actions of individuals we over look the fact that they are operating as part of and often in service of a system .

What sort of incentives could get them to do that ?

Well , readers , are there any incentives that would get you to use less data ?
Feel free to offer your suggestions for AT&T in the comments below .
And do n't worry about actually paying more for data ( yet , anyway ) , as AT&T 's Ralph de la Vega is now saying that " we have not made any decision to implement tiered pricing , " which is a slight backtrack from previous hints to the contrary .

I had been cautioned not to discuss the details of the case with anyone except my defense team .
At one point , I told Amy that I had decided to keep a journal of the experience .
Apparently , this was a bad idea .
A journal could be subpoenaed , and even if it contained no evidence of wrongdoing , the plaintiff ’s lawyer could very likely find something that would be used against me .
So talk only to Amy and my claims representative ; other than that , suck it up .
After the initial flurry of activity , things subsided , and more than a year elapsed before I was deposed .
For a grueling four hours , the plaintiff ’s lawyer asked a lot of questions , but he did not hold my feet to the fire , and then that was that .
It is often the case that these suits drag on for years , so I was taken by surprise when , in fall 2007 , a trial date was scheduled for Oct. 27 , 2008 , in Middlesex Superior Court .
In January 2008 , I left my primary care practice after almost 30 years .
I ca n’t say it was because of being sued , but I ca n’t say it was irrelevant either .
In September 2008 , Amy and I resumed the process of reviewing records and discussing strategy .
In early October , I was coached on how to testify : keep your feet on the floor , do not cross your legs or fold your arms .
Do n’t put your fingers together and pontificate .
For heaven ’s sake , do n’t slump .
Answers should be crisp and cogent , but do not hesitate more than three seconds before responding .
Look at the jury .
Do n’t lose your cool during the cross-examination .
And above all , relax and be yourself .
On Oct. 16 , 11 days before trial , I got an urgent e-mail message from Amy .
It turned out that the plaintiffs and their law firm had “ irreconcilable differences . ”
These differences were n’t spelled out , but it appeared that the lawyers had decided they were not going to win the case .
They could n’t have figured this out four and a half years earlier ?
Before all this wasted time , the emotional anguish , and the more than $ 150,000 spent by my insurance company in the run-up to trial ?
The plaintiffs , my patient ’s children , refused to let their lawyers drop the case .
I could imagine that they did n’t feel well served by this process .
They met with their lawyers to resolve this , but neither side gave in .
As this slowly unfolded , my mood turned from stoic resignation to a toxic muck of apathy and irritation .
On Oct. 23 everyone except me went in front of the judge .
The plaintiffs ’ lawyers asked to withdraw from the case , and the family requested a continuance , which would allow the case to be tried at a later time with a new set of lawyers .
Amy opposed the continuance .
The judge denied the continuance and ordered everyone to proceed with the trial as scheduled .
Just before Amy left , the children and their lawyers conferred again .
The lawyers told them that they were unlikely to win and that they would have to pay for the expert witnesses if the case went forward .
Finally , the family agreed to drop it , and they all went before the judge to seal the deal .
Amy called me .
All in all , I thought I was pretty cool about the whole thing by now .
The initial turbulent emotions had been squeezed out or tamped down , and I was ready for whatever happened .
But when she told me the news , I started to cry .
Nope , that 's not a headline from The Onion .
POGO has just learned that researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory accidentally blew a building apart a few weeks ago with a massive gun that acts like a Civil War cannon .
From our press release :
According to a Los Alamos National Laboratory ( LANL ) Occurrence Report , " Shock and Detonation Physics Group researchers heard a loud unusual noise from Technical Area 15 , Building 562 after firing a shot from a large - bore powder gun ( LBPG ) . "
The researchers accidentally blew a building apart at Technical Area - 15 , on December 16 , 2009 while testing a gun which acts like a Civil War cannon .
While no one was hurt , sources advise POGO that there was over $ 3 million in damage to property .
The explosion blew the doors off the building -- which is described in the report as , " two doors were propelled off the facility . "
The Facility Operations Director " declared a management concern due to the significant facility structural damage incurred resultant of the shot . "
Parts of the cannon were found outside the building .
" I must say that this is a new twist in the long history of screw - ups by Los Alamos , " said POGO 's Senior Investigator , Peter Stockton .
“ I have no idea in the world why they have a gun like this , let alone testing it . ”

Every delegate to the Copenhagen summit is being greeted by the sight of a vast fake planet dominating the city 's central square .
This swirling globe is covered with corporate logos – the Coke brand is stamped over Africa , while Carlsberg appears to own Asia , and McDonald 's announces " I 'm loving it ! " in great red letters above .
" Welcome to Hopenhagen ! " it cries .
It is kept in the sky by endless blasts of hot air .
This plastic planet is the perfect symbol for this summit .
The world is being told that this is an emergency meeting to solve the climate crisis – but here inside the Bela Centre where our leaders are gathering , you can find only a corrupt shuffling of words , designed to allow countries to wriggle out of the bare minimum necessary to prevent the unravelling of the biosphere .
Staggering across the fringes of the summit are the people who will see their countries live or die on the basis of its deliberations .
Leah Wickham , a young woman from Fiji , broke down as she told the conference she will see her homeland disappear beneath the waves if we do not act now .
" All the hopes of my generation rest on Copenhagen , " she pleaded .

Mohamed Nasheed , the President of the drowning Maldives , said simply : " The last generation of humans went to the moon .
This generation of humans needs to decide if it wants to stay alive on planet Earth . "
We know what has to happen to give us a fighting chance of avoiding catastrophe .
We need carbon emissions in rich countries to be 40 per cent lower than they were in 1990 – by 2020 .
We can haggle with each other over how to get there but we can't haggle with atmospheric physics over the end - goal : the Earth 's atmosphere has put this limit on what it can absorb , and we can respect it , or suffer .
Yet the first week of this summit is being dominated by the representatives of the rich countries trying to lace the deal with Enron - style accounting tricks that will give the impression of cuts , without the reality .
It 's essential to understand these shenanigans this week , so we can understand the reality of the deal that will be announced with great razzmatazz next week .
Most of the tricks centre around a quirk in the system : a rich country can " cut " its emissions without actually releasing fewer greenhouse gases .
How ?
It can simply pay a poor country to emit less than it otherwise would have .
In theory it sounds okay : we all have the same atmosphere , so who cares where the cuts come from ?
But a system where emissions cuts can be sold among countries introduces extreme complexity into the system .
It quickly ( and deliberately ) becomes so technical that nobody can follow it – no concerned citizen , no journalist , and barely even full - time environmental groups .
You can see if your government is building more coal power stations , or airports , or motorways .
You can't see if the cuts they have " bought " halfway round the world are happening – especially when they are based on projections of increases that would have happened , in theory , if your government had n't stumped up the cash .
A study by the University of Stanford found that most of the projects that are being funded as " cuts " either do n't exist , do n't work , or would have happened anyway .
Yet this is n't a small side - dish to the deal : it 's the main course .
For example , under proposals from the US , the country with by far the highest per capita emissions in the world would n't need to cut its own gas by a single exhaust pipe until 2026 , insisting it'll simply pay for these shadow - projects instead .
It gets worse still .
A highly complex system operating in the dark is a gift to corporate lobbyists , who can pressure or bribe governments into rigging the system in their favour , rather than the atmosphere's .
It 's worth going through some of the scams that are bleeding the system of any meaning .
They may sound dull or technical , but they are life or death to countries like Leah's .
Trick one : hot air .
The nations of the world were allocated permits to release greenhouse gases back in 1990 , when the Soviet Union was still a vast industrial power – so it was given a huge allocation .
But the following year , it collapsed , and its industrial base went into freefall – along with its carbon emissions .
It was never going to release those gases after all .
But Russia and the eastern European countries have held on to them in all negotiations as " theirs " .
Now , they are selling them to rich countries who want to purchase " cuts " .
Under the current system , the US can buy them from Romania and say they have cut emissions – even though they are nothing but a legal fiction .
We are n't talking about climatic small change .
This hot air represents 10 gigatonnes of CO2 .
By comparison , if the entire developed world cuts its emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 , that will only take six gigatonnes out of the atmosphere .
Trick two : double - counting .
This is best understood through an example .
If Britain pays China to abandon a coal power station and construct a hydro- electric dam instead , Britain pockets the reduction in carbon emissions as part of our overall national cuts .
In return , we are allowed to keep a coal power station open at home .
But at the same time , China also counts this change as part of its overall cuts .
So one tonne of carbon cuts is counted twice .
This means the whole system is riddled with exaggeration – and the figure for overall global cuts is a con .
Trick three : the fake forests – or what the process opaquely dubs " LULUCF " .
Forests soak up warming gases and store them away from the atmosphere – so , perfectly sensibly , countries get credit under the new system for preserving them .
It is an essential measure to stop global warming .
But the Canadian , Swedish and Finnish logging companies have successfully pressured their governments into inserting an absurd clause into the rules .
The new rules say you can , in the name of " sustainable forest management " , cut down almost all the trees – without losing credits .
It 's Kafkaesque : a felled forest does n't increase your official emissions ... even though it increases your actual emissions .
There are dozens more examples like this , but you and I would lapse into a coma if I listed them .
This is deliberate .
This system has been made incomprehensible because if we understood , ordinary citizens would be outraged .
If these were good faith negotiations , such loopholes would be dismissed in seconds .
And the rich countries are flatly refusing to make even these enfeebled , leaky cuts legally binding .
You can toss them in the bin the moment you leave the conference centre , and nobody will have any comeback .
On the most important issue in the world – the stability of our biosphere – we are being scammed .
Our leaders are are n't giving us Hopenhagen – they 're giving us Cokenhagen , a sugary feelgood hit filled with sickly additives and no nutrition .
Their behaviour here – where the bare minimum described as safe by scientists is n't even being considered – indicates they are more scared of the corporate lobbyists that fund their campaigns , or the denialist streak in their own country , than of rising seas and falling civilisations .
But there is one reason why I am still – despite everything – defiantly hopeful .
Converging on this city now are thousands of ordinary citizens who are n't going to take it any more .
They are n't going to watch passively while our ecosystems are vandalised .
They are demanding only what the cold , hard science demands – real and rapid cuts , enforced by a global environmental court that will punish any nation that endangers us all .
This movement will not go away .
Copenhagen has soured into a con – but from the wreckage , there could arise a stronger demand for a true solution .
If we do n't raise the political temperature very fast , the physical temperature will rise – and we can say goodbye to Leah , and to the only safe climate we have ever known .

The US government ’s double standard on extradition : CIA agents vs. Roman Polanski
By David Walsh
6 November 2009
It is worth considering the contrast between the refusal of the US government to cooperate with the extradition to Italy of 23 convicted CIA and Air Force kidnappers , and its determined effort to see filmmaker Roman Polanski returned to Los Angeles so that “ justice can be served . ”
The CIA agents ( and one Air Force colonel ) , in collaboration with the Italian intelligence services , organized the abduction of Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr , known as Abu Omar , an Egyptian cleric , on a Milan street in February 2003 and flew him to Egypt , where he was sadistically tortured over several years .
Nasr was never charged with a crime or brought before any court of law .
An accompanying article posted today on the World Socialist Web Site explains the horrific details of the case , but it should be noted that Abu Omar alleges he was beaten severely by his CIA captors , that he was subsequently held in an underground cell in Egypt “ where you cannot distinguish between night and day , and the cockroaches and rats and insects walk all over ” one ’s body , and that he was “ hung up like slaughtered cattle , head down , feet up , hands behind my back , feet also tied together , and I was exposed to electric shocks all over my body and especially the head area to weaken the brain … ”
Milan prosecutors provided evidence indicating that US involvement did not end with turning Nasr over to Egyptian authorities .
The prosecutors produced cell phone and hotel reservation records revealing that Robert Seldon Lady , the CIA ’s chief in Milan and one of the defendants in the case ( who received an 8 - year sentence in absentia ) , traveled to Cairo four days after Abu Omar was deposited there and stayed in the city for two weeks — no doubt , to see if the torture was bearing fruit .
Lady fled the villa in northern Italy to which he had retired when the investigation into the Abu Omar case became more serious .
He is assumed to be living in the US .
There is no clamor , however , in the American media that “ Lady must face justice ” for his serious crimes .
In February 2007 , after a judge in Milan ordered the group of American agents to stand trial on kidnapping charges , the Bush administration announced its intention to protect the CIA personnel .
State Department legal adviser John Bellinger told a news briefing , “ We ’ve not got an extradition request from Italy …
If we got an extradition request from Italy , we would not extradite US officials to Italy . ”
In any event , the Italian government has steadfastly refused the prosecutors ’ extradition request .
Prosecutor Armando Spataro told the media he was now “ considering asking Rome to issue international arrest warrants for the fugitive Americans on the strength of the convictions . ”
The right - wing Berlusconi government is unlikely to take any such action .
The Obama administration is continuing the Bush policy , expressing its “ disappointment ” with the Italian verdict and promising not to hand over the CIA criminals .
The US Justice Department ’s Office of International Affairs ( OIA ) , which would handle any Italian request for extradition of the CIA agents from the US , treated the Polanski matter in a quite different fashion .
Its agents monitored the film director ’s movements in Europe since at least last December , according to emails obtained by the Associated Press , rejecting Austria as a possible site for his arrest before settling on Switzerland , after a tip from authorities there in September .
On September 25 , OIA officials emailed the Los Angeles district attorney ’s office , confidently predicting that the Swiss would hold onto Polanski .
“ Generally , Switzerland does not release fugitives sought for extradition , ” the email explained .
“ The default in Switzerland is that a fugitive will be detained until s/he is either extradited or determined by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court to be non-extraditable . ”
The campaign against Polanski , who pled guilty to having sex with a teenage girl in 1977 and then fled the US after a judge threatened to renege on a plea bargain agreement , is entirely vindictive .
It is a sop to the right - wing “ family values ” crowd that now has such a significant influence on social policy in the US .
On October 2 , a team of Polanski ’s lawyers met with Justice Department officials , including Clinton appointee Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bruce Swartz , who oversees the OIA , in an effort to convince them to drop the extradition proceedings .
The attorneys presented the Obama administration officials with arguments against returning Polanski to Los Angeles .
They summarized allegations of prosecutorial and judicial misconduct in the 1977 case , and contended that Polanski had little chance of receiving a fair hearing in California should he be extradited to the US .
The Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s Office said the “ lobbying ” effort would have no impact on the process .
Declared public information officer Sandi Gibbons ,
“ We will be following the procedure that we follow in all international extraditions .
We send all the necessary materials to Washington and the request goes out from there . ”
And , indeed , the Swiss announced October 23 that the US government , through its embassy in Bern , had formally asked for Polanski ’s extradition the evening before .
When it comes to intelligence and military personnel guilty of major crimes , the Obama administration , like the Bush regime before it , flouts international law and protects the perpetrators .
It proceeds with zeal when it comes to a film director wanted for a 30 - year - old crime , whose prosecution is useful in whipping up social backwardness and strengthening the powers of the state .
The double standard could hardly be clearer .
Being raped or sexually assaulted should not happen at institutions of higher learning .
Unfortunately , many young women learn that their colleges and universities are unequipped to prevent sexual violence - and reporting the action could prompt a wall of silence .

The Center for Public Integrity is in the process of publishing a multi-part series on campus assault .
Their initial findings are chilling , and accurately summarized as " High Rates of Rape , Closed Hearings , and Confusing Laws : "
One national study reports that roughly one in five women who attend college will become the victim of a rape or an attempted rape by the time she graduates .
But while the vast majority of students who are sexually assaulted remain silent - just over 95 percent , according to a study funded by the research arm of the U.S. Justice Department - those who come forward can encounter mystifying disciplinary proceedings , secretive school administrations , and off - the - record negotiations .
At times , policies lead to dropped complaints and , in cases like [ Kathryn ]
Russell 's , gag orders later found to be illegal .
Many college administrators believe the existing processes provide a fair and effective way to deal with ultra-sensitive allegations , but alleged victims say these processes leave them feeling like victims a second time .

Kathyrn Russell was a student at the University of Virginia .
She was allegedly * raped by another student and initially went through the normal channels to try to get help :
Days before filing her complaint , Russell learned that the local district attorney would n't press criminal charges - a typical outcome .
Experts say the reasons are simple :
Most cases involving campus rape allegations come down to he - said - she - said accounts of sexual acts that clearly occurred ; they lack independent corroboration like physical evidence or eyewitness testimony .
At times , alcohol and drugs play such a central role , students can't remember details .
Given all this , says Gary Pavela , who ran judicial programs at the University of Maryland , College Park , " A prosecutor says , ‘ I 'm not going to take this to a jury . ' "
Often , the only venues in which to resolve these cases are on campus .

Out of options , Russell pursued her case through the with the campus based process .
The Center then describes how these panels work from school to school .
Internal disciplinary panels , like the UVA Sexual Assault Board , exist in various forms on most campuses .
But they 're not the only way schools handle rape allegations .
For decades , informal proceedings run by an administrator have represented the most common method to adjudicate disciplinary matters .
Typically , an administrator meets with both students , separately , in an attempt to resolve a complaint .
Occasionally , they " mediate " the incident .
Officials find such adjudication appealing in uncontested situations .
If a dean elicits a confession , says Olshak , of Illinois State , who headed the student conduct association in 2001 , " We 'll be able to resolve the complaint quickly , easily , and without the confrontation of a judicial hearing . "
Resolution , as in formal hearings , can mean expulsion , suspension , probation , or another academic penalty , like an assigned research paper .
By all accounts , informal processes take place almost as frequently as formal ones ; at UVA , for example , the administration has held 16 hearings since 1998 , as compared to 10 informal meetings .
And these proceedings can turn out positively for student victims .
In January 2005 , Carrie Ressler , then a junior at Concordia University , near Chicago , reported being raped by a football player after attending a party in his dorm .
On January 19 , within hours of the alleged assault , the police arrested the student athlete ; by October , he 'd pled guilty to battery for " knowingly [ making ] physical contact of an insulting nature , " court records show .
At Concordia , Ressler 's report landed on the desk of Dean of Students Jeffrey Hynes .
The morning of the arrest , the dean summoned her to his office .
" He told me he'd be telling the perpetrator he needed to leave by choice , " she remembers Hynes saying .
" If not , he'd be expelled . "
Within days , the athlete had left Concordia .
Hynes declined to comment on Ressler 's case .
" The dean acted in my interests , " Ressler says .
She recognizes , though , that the informal adjudication served the university 's interests , too .
" I got the sense from the dean that the school wanted to keep this case hush - hush . "

Resolving the cases speedily and quietly are in the school 's best interest , from a publicity and liability standpoint .
But what happens when this emphasis on discretion begins to help the assailant ?
More formal proceedings are sometimes no less shrouded .
College disciplinary hearings , unlike courts , lack the trappings of transparency - campus spectators .
Advocates can't attend unless serving as " advisers " to students .
Only integral participants like board members or administrators have any clue when a hearing occurs .
" They 're secret because they 're closed , " says S. Daniel Carter , of Security on Campus Inc. , a watchdog group .
Administrators see it differently , arguing that there are important distinctions between " secrecy " and " privacy . "
They can't open up internal proceedings - formal or informal - because that would amount to granting access to private educational records , which FERPA prohibits , they say .
But that does n't mean they 're operating in secret .
" Not providing private information to the rest of the world is respecting confidentiality and respecting FERPA as a law , " says Mary Beth Mackin , assistant dean of student life at the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater .
And while proceedings remain hidden to outsiders , administrators maintain they 're conducted so students feel they 're as open as possible .
Lisa Simpson would probably disagree .
Her allegations of rape at the University of Colorado at Boulder blew open a scandal of sexual assault allegations against football players and recruits in 2004 ; three years later , her Title IX lawsuit brought against CU ended in a $ 2.85 million settlement in her favor .
Yet she found CU 's judicial process a mystery .
In December 2001 , Simpson , then a CU sophomore , alleged she was raped by five football players and recruits during a beer - soaked party .
They claimed she was a willing participant .
Within days , Simpson 's rape report made its way to CU 's judicial affairs director , Matthew Lopez - Phillips .
During a meeting in his office , she recalls him relaying how a panel of students , faculty , and staff would adjudicate .
At the time , CU 's official conduct code stated that alleged victims would generally be expected to participate in the process by " providing testimony at the formal hearing of the accused , " among other things .
But Simpson never appeared before a panel .
No panelist interviewed her about the report , or the victim impact statement she filed .
Even after her five - year legal battle against CU over its response to her case - a battle that sparked a broader investigation , as well as systematic reform - she has no idea what transpired before the panel , or if it actually even existed .
CU documents obtained by the Center show one accused student underwent a formal hearing as a result of Simpson 's report ; three others had informal , administrative proceedings .
But some CU documents on the panel remain sealed by protective order , and only one includes a list of 17 possible panelists .
Court records have revealed the identity of only one panelist .
" For all I know , " Simpson says , " it could have been a panel of athletic coaches . "

The report returns to Russell 's experience .
Bound by the school 's repeated admonishments that all proceedings were confidential , she and the student she accused were to both come before the panel and present their case .
The person she accused had this to say :
Russell and the alleged assailant agreed on initial details - they ran into each other at a bar ; he ended up at her dorm ; she offered him an air mattress to sleep .
But they painted different pictures of what transpired next .
The man , Russell said , grabbed her from behind , ignored her pleas to stop , and " used [ me ] for his sexual need . "
Russell , the man countered , " tacitly agreed to have sex , " demanding a condom , and never saying no .
" Not all my actions would in a day - to - day situation be considered kosher , " he wrote in his April 23 , 2004 defense .
" But none of my actions broached or even swept near the arena of rape . "

So , something was amiss .
He just did n't think it was rape .
Interesting .
I wonder if he would have seen things differently if , instead of looking for the absence of a no , the cue to continue sexual activity was universally understood as an enthusiastic yes .
However , Russell did n't realize how deeply ingrained this type of thinking is until the panel came back with its decision .
The report continues :
Kathryn Russell did n't think much about her school 's policy until things went badly .
At the hearing , board members asked questions making her wonder about their training - " Did it occur to you to perhaps leave the room ? "
" Why not just shut the door [ on him ] ? "
Sources familiar with the UVA board 's training describe it as extensive ; in 2004 , the school required members to undergo a day of preparation featuring a videotape and reading materials , as well as sessions with outside experts on campus sexual assault .
One previous board member describes Russell 's panelists as open - minded and thoughtful .
But the panel also judged her complaint using a " clear and convincing " evidence standard , which the Education Department ruled , in one 2004 case , is higher than Title IX authorizes - and which victim advocates argue is illegal .
In the end , the student Russell accused was found " not responsible " for sexual assault .
The board instead slapped him with a verbal reprimand .
" We … believe that you used very bad judgment , " Sisson declared .
The case resulted in one of nine " not - responsible " verdicts the UVA board has handed down over the past decade , as compared to seven responsible ones .
" You can have a bad sexual experience but not be sexually assaulted under the university 's definition and standard of evidence , " says the prior UVA board member .
Russell saw it differently .
" It was just a charade , " she said .
Russell is n't the only one who found herself pressured into accepting an unsatisfactory decision .
In November 2003 , Mallory Shear - Heyman , then a sophomore at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania , underwent a confidential mediation after reporting being raped in her dorm by a fellow student .
Mediations became popular in disciplinary matters involving sexual assault earlier in the decade , and remain common today - despite controversy .
In 2001 , the Education Department deemed mediations improper partly because they carry no punishment .
And while mediation is generally considered effective for resolving interpersonal conflicts , the department - and many critics - argue that it falls short in instances of sexual violence .
The reason : an intimidating element exists between victims and their assailants because , like other serious assault , sexual assault is a violent act " In some cases , " the department states in its guidance document , referring to sexual assault cases , " mediation will not be appropriate even on a voluntary basis . "
But Bucknell administrators defend their use of the practice , which they now call " voluntary facilitated dialogue , " precisely because it only occurs at the request of an accusing student , with the willing participation of an accused student .
Any power imbalance , they argue , is evened out by the presence of two administrators - one male , one female - guiding the conversation and assuring a comfortable setting .
" Our students have really been key spokespeople for indicating they want some sort of option to have this dialogue , " says Kari Conrad , judicial administrator for sexual misconduct .
" We feel confident in keeping this process as a responsible response . "
Shear - Heyman remembers Bucknell officials portraying the off - the - record session as an attractive way to confront the accused student , " as if it were the best option ever . "
Confidentiality , they relayed , would allow for more open and honest discussion .
She was presented with a waiver , which specified that " information first disclosed during mediation may not be used in any subsequent internal University proceeding . "
But Shear - Heyman would n't grasp the waiver 's implications until the accused student , she says , implicated himself .
Bucknell records show the student apologized to her in instant messages , admitting " b/ c you got hurt , yes , " what had occurred was rape .
She says he repeated the admissions before the two deans who participated in the mediation - Gerald Commerford and Amy Badal .
The waiver did not prevent Shear - Heyman from pursuing outside remedies .
But the deans , she says , gave her the strong impression that she could n't use what had occurred in the session - on or off campus .
When she later considered pursuing criminal charges , she says , the deans claimed not to remember the accused student 's alleged admissions .

In response to the painful facts pulled into sharp focus by the study , Feministing points to The Campus Accountability Project , a joint effort by SAFER and V - Day .
The Campus Accountability Project has set a three year time frame to gather data on the school sexual assault policies , reach out to activists looking to challenge unfair policies , and prepare a new report based on their findings .
* Here , allegedly is used only because no conclusion was reached in this case in the court of law .

Yemen : New frontier in US ' war on terror '
By Humphrey Hawksley
BBC News
Yemen is fertile ground for al - Qaeda
The increased violence in Yemen is a clear indication that military campaigns to crush al - Qaeda - inspired violence extend far beyond the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
It also shows up hostile fault - lines within the Middle East , pitting mainly Shia Iran against Sunni Saudi Arabia , who condemn each other for taking sides in Yemen 's long - running civil war .
Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Arab world with almost half its 24 million people living below the poverty line and an authoritarian government that has failed to win the trust of a substantive part of its own population .
This makes fertile ground for al - Qaeda .
US intelligence agencies have determined that , along with Pakistan , Yemen is a key area on which to concentrate on al - Qaeda .
More than 90 detainees still in America 's Guantanamo Bay detention centre come from Yemen .
That is nearly half the total .
Despite the policy to close Guantanamo , US authorities do not want to send them back for fear that they would boost al - Qaeda 's operations and morale there .
The US has invested some $ 70 m ( £ 40 m ) in military aid in Yemen in the past year , believed to include training , the use of drones and intelligence to pinpoint al - Qaeda camps and activity .
Much is classified because neither Yemen nor the US wants American activities there to stir up yet more dissent .
The instability in Yemen is becoming critical .
Al - Qaeda has announced that its networks in Yemen and Saudi Arabia have merged to create al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
The civil war is being waged by the Shia community in the north that borders Saudi Arabia .
Saudi forces have actively intervened .
In one case it was accused of bombing a market killing many civilians .
Iran has publicly warned against any foreign intervention .
And - although the phrase is now frowned upon - US intelligence agencies are keeping a closer and closer watch in this newly - emerging theatre in the " war on terror " .

Online sketch comedy team LoadingReadyRun is back behind the wheel , promising to play the most boring video game ever designed - Desert Bus , from Penn & Teller 's Smoke and Mirrors for Sega CD - in return for your donations .
Desert Bus is a simulator that depicts driving a bus between Tucson , Ariz . and Las Vegas in real time .
The game can not be paused .
The first hour of driving - which begins this very minute at LoadingReadyRun 's bus campaign HQ in Vancouver - requires only a $ 1 donation .
But additional hours require donations that increase by 7 percent every hour .
You keep donatin ' and they keep drivin ' .
As of writing , they had already collected $ 5,640 before even cranking the bus ' engine , buying a total of 88 hours so far .
By their scale , a million dollars donated would double that playing time .

The bus crew played the game over five days last year , raising $ 70,000 in the process .
Penn Jillette referred to the marathon in the latest edition of Game Informer , marveling that the team was able to pile up a score of " eight points . "
You get one point per completed trip between the two cities .
You can follow the action on two live streaming cams :

“ This is no idle danger , ” Mr. Obama said , “ no hypothetical threat . ”
He warned that new attacks were being plotted in the region , and raised the terrifying prospect of an unchecked Al Qaeda taking over a nuclear - armed Pakistan .
Mr. Obama ’s decision to send an additional 30,000 troops  and ask NATO allies for several thousand more  is unlikely to end the political debate .
Republicans are certain to point out that it is still short of the 40,000 requested by the top field commander , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , and object to the president ’s pledge of a quick drawdown .
Many Democrats and the president ’s own vice president had opposed any escalation .
At this late date , we do n’t know if even 100,000 American troops plus 40,000 from NATO will be enough to turn the war around .
But we are sure that continuing President Bush ’s strategy of fighting on the cheap ( in January 2008 , the start of Mr. Bush ’s last year in office and more than six years after the war began , there were only 27,000 American troops in Afghanistan ) is a guarantee of defeat .
Mr. Obama said he planned to move those 30,000 troops in quickly  within six months  to break the Taliban ’s momentum , secure key population centers , speed up training of Afghan security forces and then hand over control to Afghan authorities .
He said he expected to be able to start drawing down American forces in July 2011 .
But he made no promise about when all American combat troops would be gone , saying only that the decision would be based on conditions on the ground .
Over all , we found the president ’s military arguments persuasive .
The Afghan people have no love for the Taliban ’s medieval ideas and brutality , but the Karzai government ’s failure to provide basic services or security has led many to conclude that they have no choice but to submit .
Driving the Taliban back swiftly and decisively from key cities and regions should help change that calculation .
Coupled with an offer of negotiations , it may also peel away less committed fighters .
Index to Five Millennium Catalog of Lunar Eclipses
- 1999 to +3000 ( 2000 BCE to 3000 CE )
Introduction
Eclipses of the Moon can occur when the Moon is near one of its two orbital nodes [ 1 ] during the Full Moon phase .
It is then possible for the Moon to pass through Earth 's penumbral or umbral shadows thereby producing an eclipse .
There are three types of lunar eclipses :
Penumbral - Moon traverses Earth 's penumbral shadow ( Moon misses Earth 's umbral shadow ) Partial - Moon traverses Earth 's penumbral and umbral shadows ( Moon does not pass completely into Earth 's umbra ) Total - Moon traverses Earth 's penumbral and umbral shadows ( Moon passes completely into Earth 's umbra )
Furthermore , total eclipses can be classified as either central [ 2 ] or non-central .
The visual appearance of each of these eclipse types differs dramatically from each other .
The recurrence of lunar eclipses is governed by the Saros cycle .
For more information , see Periodicity of Lunar Eclipses .
Statistics for Lunar Eclipses : - 1999 to +3000 ( 2000 BCE to 3000 CE )
During the five Millennium period - 1999 to +3000 ( 2000 BCE to 3000 CE [ 3 ] ) , Earth will experience 12064 lunar eclipses .
The following table shows the number of eclipses of each type over this period .
Lunar Eclipses : -1999 to +3000 Eclipse Type Symbol Number Percent All Eclipses - 12064 100.0 % Penumbral N 4378 36.3 % Partial P 4207 34.9 % Total T 3479 28.8 %
During most penumbral eclipses , only part of the Moon passes through Earth 's penumbral shadow .
However , it is also possible to have a penumbral eclipse in which the Moon passes completely within Earth 's penumbral shadow without entering the inner umbral shadow .
Such total penumbral eclipses are quite rare compared to normal ( or partial ) penumbral eclipses .
The table below shows the distribution of the two penumbral eclipse types during the 5000 - year period of this Catalog .
Penumbral Lunar Eclipses : -1999 to +3000 Classification Number Percent All 4378 100.0 % Partial Penumbral 4237 96.8 % Total Penumbral 141 3.2 %
Total lunar eclipses through Earth 's umbral shadow can be categorized as :
Central - Some part of the Moon passes through the central axis of Earth 's umbral shadow .
Non-Central - The Moon misses the central axis of Earth 's umbral shadow .
Using the above categories , the distribution of the 3,479 total eclipses is shown in the table below .
Total Lunar Eclipses : - 1999 to +3000 Classification Number Percent All 3479 100.0 % Central Total 2074 59.6 % Non-Central Total 1405 40.4 %
There are a minimum of two and a maximum of five lunar eclipses in every calendar year .
Statistics for the number of eclipses each year over the 5000 year period are listed below .
Number of Eclipses Per Year Number of Eclipses Number of Years Percent 2 3541 70.8 % 3 887 17.7 % 4 539 10.8 % 5 33 0.7 %
The longest eclipses of the 5,000 year period are listed below .
Longest Penumbral Lunar Eclipse : 1322 Nov 24 Duration = 296.5 m Longest Partial Lunar Eclipse : 2669 Feb 08 Duration = 210.0 m Longest Total Lunar Eclipse : 0318 May 31 Duration = 106.6 m
Five Millennium Catalog of Lunar Eclipses : - 1999 to +3000 ( 2000 BCE to 3000 CE )
The table below summarizes the statistical distribution of lunar eclipse types over this five millennium period .
Each line in the table corresponds to one century and gives the breakdown of each eclipse type ( penumbral , partial , and total ) .
The date intervals themselves are each a link to a catalog listing complete details for every lunar eclipse in the selected century .
The data in these 100 year eclipse tables include the date and time of greatest eclipse [ 4 ] , ΔT , lunar libration number , Saros series , the eclipse type , quincena solar eclipse parameter , gamma , eclipse magnitudes , eclipse phase durations , and local circumstances .
For a detailed key and additional information about the catalogs , see : Key to Catalog of Lunar Eclipses .
Calendar
The Gregorian calendar is used for all dates from 1582 Oct 15 onwards .
Before that date , the Julian calendar is used .
For more information on this topic , see Calendar Dates .
The Julian calendar does not include the year 0 .
Thus the year 1 BCE is followed by the year 1 CE ( See : BCE / CE Dating Conventions ) .
This is awkward for arithmetic calculations .
Years in this catalog are numbered astronomically and include the year 0 .
Historians should note there is a difference of one year between astronomical dates and BCE dates .
Thus , the astronomical year 0 corresponds to 1 BCE , and astronomical year - 1 corresponds to 2 BCE , etc . .
Predictions
Lunar eclipse predictions must take into account the enlargement of Earth 's shadows .
In this Catalog , Earth 's penumbral and umbral shadow sizes have been calculated using Danjon 's enlargement method .
The coordinates of the Sun used in the predictions are based on the VSOP87 theory [ Bretagnon and Francou , 1988 ] .
The Moon 's coordinates are based on the ELP - 2000 / 82 theory [ Chapront - Touze and Chapront , 1983 ] .
For more information , see : Solar and Lunar Ephemerides .
The revised value used for the Moon 's secular acceleration is n- dot = - 25.858 arc - sec / cy*cy , as deduced from the Apollo lunar laser ranging experiment ( Chapront , Chapront - Touze , and Francou , 2002 ) .
The largest uncertainty in the eclipse predictions is caused by fluctuations in Earth 's rotation due primarily to tidal friction of the Moon .
The resultant drift in apparent clock time is expressed as ΔT and is determined as follows :
pre-1950's : ΔT calculated from empirical fits to historical records derived by Morrison and Stephenson ( 2004 ) 1955 - 2006 : ΔT obtained from published observations Post - 2006 : ΔT is extrapolated from current values weighted by the long term trend from tidal effects
A series of polynomial expressions have been derived to simplify the evaluation of ΔT for any time from - 1999 to +3000 .
The uncertainty in ΔT over this period can be estimated from scatter in the measurements .

A former reader emails today to pass along a firsthand account of the shooting at Fort Hood on Thursday .
It ’s unedited except for paragraph breaks :
I was walking into the medical SRP building when he started firing ( he never made it to the main SRP building …. the media accounts are understandably pretty off right now ) .
He was calmly and methodically shooting everyone .
Like every non-deployed military post , no one was armed .
For the first time in my life I really wish I had a weapon .
I do n’t know how to explain what it feels like to have someone shoot at you while you ’re unarmed .
He missed me but did n’t miss a lot of others .
Just pure random luck .
It ’s a very compressed area , thus the numbers .
I saw a lot of heroism .
So many more would have died if this was n’t an Army post .
We ’re almost all CLS trained and it made a huge difference .
Cause the EMTs did n’t get there for almost an hour ( they thought there was a second shooter ) .
I just ca n’t believe one of our own shot us .
When I saw his ID card I could n’t believe it .
After he shot the female police officer he was fumbling his reload and I saw the other police officer around the corner and yelled at him to come shoot the shooter .
He did .
Then I used my belt as a tourniquet on the female officer .
I hate to tell you this but in the course of the day it became clear that it was another Akbar incident .
1
( Once they convinced them the blood drenching my clothes was n’t mine I spent the day being interviewed by the alphabet . )
Akbar again .
God help us .
He was very planned .
I counted three full mags around him ( I secured his weapon for a while ) .
Found out later that his car was filled with more ammo .
This was premeditated .
This was n’t VBC again .
That guy snapped , not this one .
He was so damn calm when he was shooting .
Methodical .
And he was moving tactically .
The Army really is diverse and we really do love all our own .
We signed up to be shot at but not at home .
Not unarmed .
No one should ever see what the inside of that medical SRP building looked like .
I suppose that ’s what VA Tech looked like .
Except they did n’t have soldiers coming from everywhere to tourniquet and compress and talk to the wounded while rounds are still coming out .
No one touched him …the shooter that is …other than to treat him .
Though I told the medic ( and I ’m not proud of this ) that was giving him plasma that there better not be anyone else who needed it because he should be the last one to be treated .
But I had just finished holding a soldier who was critical ( I counted three entry wounds ) and talking to him about his children … .
If the shooter had a grievance he should have taken it out on those responsible ; he was n’t shooting people he knew ( media reports to the contrary ) .
He was just shooting anybody who happened to be present for SRP medical processing , mainly lower enlisted .
But please , no one use this politically !
The Army is not “ broken ” , PTSD does n’t turn people into killers , most Muslims are n’t evil , and whether we should stay or go in Afghanistan has nothing to do with this .
I ’m babbling … sorry .
BioWare is always careful to make sure they give us a hateful venomous bitch to accompany us on our world - saving adventures .
Morrigan is our companion Shrew in Dragon Age , and you can count on her to want to save the murderers , punish the innocent , strengthen the oppressors , and kick the beggars .
And if you fail to do these things she will let you know what an unworthy sap you are , right to your face .
Like all companions , she will grow to like you or hate you based on how often you do what she wants .
She supposedly follows an anarchic " survival of the fittest " worldview , although she really does n't .
When a splinter group of mages go rogue and cause trouble , she supports killing all mages on both sides , including the young and innocent .
But , mages are powerful .
Should n't she side with one of the mage factions ?
The logic she uses to come to the " kill everyone " conclusion is more more twisted than a sack of Christmas lights and barbed wire .
This is because she does n't actually care about survival of the fittest or anything like that .
Her actual drive is just a desire to go through life and grief people for amusement or profit .
She 's a griefer , and enjoys seeing people unhappy .
On the other hand , her outfit lets you see the sides of her boobs .
So she has that going for her .
I still left her crazy ass at camp for most of the game .

Festivus is a secular holiday celebrated on December 23 as an alternative to the pressures and commercialism of the Christmas season .
Originally created by author Daniel O'Keefe , Festivus entered popular culture after it was made the focus of the 1997 Seinfeld episode " The Strike " , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] which O'Keefe 's son , Dan O'Keefe , co-wrote .
The non-commercial holiday 's celebration , as depicted on Seinfeld , occurs on December 23 and includes a Festivus dinner , an unadorned aluminum Festivus pole , practices such as the " Airing of Grievances " and " Feats of Strength " , and the labeling of easily explainable events as " Festivus miracles . " [ 3 ]
The episode refers to it as " a Festivus for the rest of us " .
It has been described both as a parody holiday festival and as a form of playful consumer resistance .
[ 4 ]
Journalist Allen Salkin describes it as " the perfect secular theme for an all - inclusive December gathering " . [ 1 ]
History [ edit ]
Festivus was conceived by author and editor Daniel O'Keefe , the father of TV writer Dan O'Keefe , and was celebrated by his family as early as 1966 .
While the Latin word festivus means " excellent , jovial , lively " , [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and derives from festus , meaning " joyous ; holiday , feast day " , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
Festivus in this sense was coined by the elder O'Keefe .
According to him , the name " just popped into my head " .
[ 1 ]
In the original O'Keefe tradition , the holiday would take place to celebrate the anniversary of Daniel O'Keefe 's first date with his future wife , Deborah . [ 10 ]
The phrase " a Festivus for the rest of us " originally referred to those remaining after the death of the elder O'Keefe 's mother , Jeanette , in 1976 ; i.e. , the " rest of us " are the living , as opposed to the dead . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
In 1982 , Daniel O'Keefe wrote a book , Stolen Lightning : The Social Theory of Magic , that deals with idiosyncratic ritual and its social significance , a theme relevant to Festivus tradition . [ 13 ]
It is now celebrated on December 23 , as depicted in the Seinfeld episode written by the younger O'Keefe . [ 2 ]
Seinfeld [ edit ]
The Seinfeld episode that featured Festivus was titled " The Strike " , although O'Keefe notes that the writers later wished they had named it " The Festivus " .
It was first broadcast on December 18 , 1997 .
The plot revolves around Cosmo Kramer ( Michael Richards ) returning to work at his old job , H&H Bagels .
While dining at Monk 's Restaurant , as George Costanza ( Jason Alexander ) is opening his mail , he receives a card from his father saying , " Dear Son , Happy Festivus . "
This leads to Jerry Seinfeld and Elaine Benes ( Julia Louis - Dreyfus ) discussing George 's father 's creation of Festivus despite George not wanting it to be discussed .
[ 3 ]
Kramer then becomes interested in resurrecting the holiday when , at the bagel shop , Frank Costanza ( Jerry Stiller ) tells him how he created Festivus as an alternative holiday in response to the commercialization of Christmas . [ 3 ]
Meanwhile , George creates donation cards for a fake charity called The Human Fund ( with the slogan " Money for People " ) in lieu of having to give office Christmas presents .
When his boss , Mr. Kruger ( Daniel von Bargen ) , questions George about a $ 20,000 check he gave George to donate to the Human Fund as a corporate donation , George hastily concocts the excuse that he made up the Human Fund because he feared persecution for his beliefs , of celebrating Festivus instead of Christmas .
Attempting to call his bluff , Kruger goes home with George to see Festivus in action . [ 3 ]
Kramer eventually goes back on strike from his bagel - vendor job when his manager tells him he cannot take December 23 off to celebrate his new - found holiday .
Kramer is then seen on the sidewalk picketing H&H Bagels , carrying a sign reading " Festivus yes !
Bagels no ! " and chanting to anyone passing the store : " Hey !
No bagel , no bagel , no bagel ... " [ 3 ]
Finally , at Frank 's house in Queens , Jerry , Elaine , Kramer , and George gather to celebrate Festivus .
George brings Kruger to prove to him that Festivus is " all too real " . [ 3 ]
O'Keefe was initially reluctant to insert his family 's tradition into this episode , but when executive producers Alec Berg and Jeff Schaffer caught wind of the bizarre holiday through his younger brother , they became curious , then enthusiastic , then insisted it have a place in the episode .
Schaffer later reflected : " That 's the thing with Seinfeld stories , the real ones are always the best ones .
There 's a nuance to reality sometimes that is just perfect .
We could have sat in a room for a billion years and we never would have made up Festivus .
It 's crazy and hilarious and just so funny and so disturbing .
It 's awesome . " [ 14 ]
Customary practices [ edit ]
The holiday , as portrayed in the Seinfeld episode , [ 1 ] [ 15 ] includes practices such as the " Airing of Grievances " , which occurs during the Festivus meal and in which each person tells everyone else all the ways they have disappointed them over the past year .
After the meal , the " Feats of Strength " are performed , involving wrestling the head of the household to the floor , with the holiday ending only if the head of the household is pinned . [ 3 ]
Festivus pole [ edit ]
In the episode , the tradition of Festivus begins with an aluminum pole .
Frank Costanza cites its " very high strength - to - weight ratio " as appealing .
During Festivus , the pole is displayed unadorned .
According to Frank , " I find tinsel distracting . "
Dan O'Keefe credits fellow Seinfeld writer Jeff Schaffer with introducing the concept .
The aluminum pole was not part of the original O'Keefe family celebration , which centered on putting a clock in a bag and nailing it to a wall . [ 16 ]
Festivus dinner [ edit ]
In " The Strike " , a celebratory dinner is shown on the evening of Festivus prior to the Feats of Strength and during the Airing of Grievances .
The on -air meal shows Estelle Costanza serving a sliced reddish meatloaf - shaped food on a bed of lettuce . [ 17 ]
In the episode no alcohol is served at the dinner , but George 's boss , Mr. Kruger , drinks something from a hip flask . [ 3 ]
The original holiday dinner in the O'Keefe household featured turkey or ham as described in Dan O'Keefe 's The Real Festivus . [ 11 ]
Airing of Grievances [ edit ]
The " Airing of Grievances " takes place immediately after the Festivus dinner has been served .
In the television episode , Frank Costanza began it with the phrase , " I got a lotta problems with you people , and now you 're going to hear about it ! "
It consists of each person lashing out at others and the world about how they have been disappointed in the past year . [ 18 ]
Feats of Strength [ edit ]
The Feats of Strength are the final tradition observed in the celebration of Festivus , celebrated immediately following ( or in the case of " The Strike " , during ) the Festivus dinner .
The head of the household selects one person at the Festivus celebration and challenges them to a wrestling match .
Tradition states Festivus is not over until the head of the household is pinned .
In " The Strike " , however , Kramer manages to circumvent the rule by creating an excuse to leave .
The Feats of Strength are mentioned twice in the episode before they take place .
In both instances , no detail was given as to what had happened , but in both instances , George Costanza ran out of the coffee shop in a mad panic , implying he had bad experiences with the Feats of Strength in the past .
What the Feats of Strength entailed was revealed at the very end of the episode , when it took place .
Failing to pin the head of the household results in Festivus continuing until such requirement is met . [ 3 ]
Festivus miracles [ edit ]
Cosmo Kramer twice declares a " Festivus Miracle " during the Festivus celebration in the Costanza household .
Kramer causes the occurrence of two " miracles " by inviting two off - track betting bookies ( Tracy Letts and Colin Malone ) to dinner with Elaine ( men whom Elaine wished to avoid ) , and by causing Jerry 's girlfriend Gwen to believe that Jerry was cheating on her . [ 19 ]
Wider adoption [ edit ]

Some people , most of them inspired by the Seinfeld episode , [ 1 ] subsequently began to celebrate the holiday with varying degrees of seriousness .
Allen Salkin 's 2005 book Festivus : The Holiday for the Rest of Us [ 10 ] chronicles the early adoption of Festivus .
Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut 's 2012 book A Kosher Christmas : ' Tis the Season to Be Jewish ' references Festivus . [ 20 ]
During the Baltimore Ravens ' run to the Super Bowl XXXV Championship in 2000 , head coach Brian Billick superstitiously issued an organizational ban on the use of the word " playoffs " until the team had clinched its first postseason berth .
[ 21 ] " Playoffs " was instead referred to as " Festivus " and the Super Bowl as " Festivus Maximus " . [ 22 ]
In 2005 , Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle was declared " Governor Festivus " , and during the holiday season displayed a Festivus Pole in the family room of the Executive Residence in Madison , Wisconsin . [ 23 ]
Governor Doyle 's 2005 Festivus Pole is now part of the collection of the Wisconsin Historical Museum . [ 24 ]
In 2010 , a CNN story featuring Jerry Stiller detailed the increasing popularity of the holiday , including US Representative Eric Cantor 's Festivus fundraiser , [ 25 ] and the Christian Science Monitor reported that Festivus was a top trend on Twitter that year . [ 26 ]
In 2012 , Google introduced a custom search result for the term " Festivus " .
In addition to the normal results , an unadorned aluminum pole was displayed running down the side of the list of search results and " A festivus miracle ! " prefixes the results count and speed . [ 27 ] [ 28 ]
Also in 2012 , a Festivus Pole was erected on city property in Deerfield Beach , Florida , alongside religious - themed holiday displays . [ 29 ]
A similar Festivus Pole was displayed next to religious displays in the Wisconsin State Capitol , along with a banner provided by the Freedom From Religion Foundation advocating for the separation of government and religion . [ 30 ]
In 2013 and 2014 , a Festivus Pole constructed with 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) of beer cans was erected next to a nativity scene and other religious holiday displays in the Florida State Capitol Building , as a protest supporting separation of church and state . [ 30 ]
In 2015 , the same man was granted permission to display a Festivus pole decorated with a gay pride theme and topped with a disco ball to celebrate the United States Supreme Court 's decision on same - sex marriage , at state capitols in Florida , [ 31 ]
Georgia , Illinois , Michigan , Missouri , Oklahoma , and Washington . [ 32 ]
In 2016 , US Senator Rand Paul released a special Festivus edition of The Waste Report . [ 33 ]
The Festivus " airing of grievances " has become an annual tradition for Paul on Twitter . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]
In 2016 , the Tampa Bay Times became the first newspaper to allow readers to submit Festivus grievances through its website , with the promise to publish them on December 23 , the day of the Festivus holiday . [ 37 ]
In 2017 , CNN's Jake Tapper recapped President Donald Trump 's berating of the news media as " instead of focusing on his accomplishments and offering an optimistic positive view of what he 's doing for this country , it was an airing of grievances , it was Festivus , it was complaints about the media . " [ 38 ]
On Christmas Eve 2017 , a meme circulated on social media of a screenshot depicting Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren delivering a Fox News Alert in which the lower third graphic overlay had been photoshopped to read , " Tomi : Obama Created Festivus to Destroy Christmas . "
In response , Lahren tweeted , " You idiots think this is real ? " and called the meme " fake news . " [ 39 ]
In Pittsburgh , an annual public Festivus celebration has been held since 2005 , featuring live bands , a Seinfeld trivia contest , and the holiday traditions .
In 2017 , the Pittsburgh City Paper called its 13th iteration " the longest - running celebration of Sein-Culture in the ' Burgh " . [ 40 ]
In 2018 , a Newsweek article was titled " Donald Trump Calls Troops On Thanksgiving But Ends Up Having A Festivus Airing Of Grievances " . [ 41 ]
In 2018 it was proposed that an unnamed lane in Corrimal , New South Wales be named Festivus Lane , which went through successfully . [ 42 ]
O'Keefe family practices [ edit ]
The O'Keefe family holiday featured other practices , as detailed in The Real Festivus ( 2005 ) , a book by Daniel O'Keefe 's son , Dan O'Keefe . [ 11 ] [ 43 ]
Besides providing a first - person account of the early version of the Festivus holiday as celebrated by the O'Keefe family , the book relates how Dan O'Keefe amended or replaced details of his father 's invention to create the Seinfeld episode . [ 44 ]
Festivus clock [ edit ]
In a 2013 CNN segment on the origins of Festivus , O'Keefe spoke about the real - life experiences related to the holiday .
O'Keefe 's father , who originated some of the now - recognized Festivus traditions , used a clock in a bag nailed to a wall , not an aluminum pole .
It was never the same bag , rarely the same clock , but always the same wall .
The nailing was most often done in secret , and then revealed proudly to his family .
The younger O'Keefe told CNN : " The real symbol of the holiday was a clock that my dad put in a bag and nailed to the wall every year ... I do n't know why , I do n't know what it means , he would never tell me .
He would always say , ' That 's not for you to know . ' " [ 16 ]

Fifty lashes for the teenage girl who wore an ' indecent ' knee length skirt in Sudan
A girl of 16 was given 50 lashes after a judge ruled her knee length skirt was indecent .
Silva Kashif was punished without her family being told after she was arrested while walking alone near her home in the Sudanese capital , Khartoum .
Her mother , Jenty Doro , said : ‘ I only heard about it after she was lashed .
Later we all sat and cried .
‘ She is just a young girl but the policeman pulled her along like she was a criminal .
It was wrong . ’
The Omdurman market in Khartoum ( file picture ) , one of the city 's many markets .
Silva Kashif was arrested as she walked to a market near her home in the Khartoum suburb of Kalatla last week
She said she would sue the police and the judge because her daughter is a Christian and underage .
The law states that under - 18s should not be given lashes .
Doro said Khashif was taken to Kalatla court where she was convicted and punished by a female police officer in front of the judge .
' I only heard about it after she was lashed .
Later we all sat and cried ...
People have different religions and that should be taken into account ' she said .
Khartoum is governed by Islamic sharia law .
But although Miss Kashif is living there she is originally from the south of the country , which is not .
The government is supposed to be working to soften the impact of sharia for southerners living in Khartoum .
Her lawyer , Azhari al - Haj , said : ‘ She was wearing a normal skirt and blouse , worn by thousands of girls .
They did n’t contact a guardian and punished her on
the spot . ’
The case will add fuel to a debate already raging over Sudan 's decency laws after this year 's high - profile conviction of Sudanese U.N. official Lubna Hussein , who was briefly jailed for wearing trousers in public .
Hussein , a former journalist who used her case to campaign against Sudan 's public order and decency regulations , is touring France to publicise her book about the prosecution .
She had faced the maximum penalty of 40 lashes but was given a lighter sentence .
Arrests for indecency , drunkenness and other public order offences are not uncommon in Khartoum which is governed by Islamic sharia law .
Earlier this year Sudanese UN official Lubna Hussein was briefly jailed for wearing trousers in public .
Rachel Maddow reports on the ' PrayerCast ' attended by Senators Jim DeMint and Sam Brownback and Rep. Michele Bachmann where they prayed for the defeat of the health care bill .
This has to be one of the creepiest things I 've watched in a long time .
Transcript via MSNBC .
MADDOW : Those two vaguely looking familiar men you see there at the end of that clip , those are two sitting Republican U.S. senators , Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas .
They were the headlining politicians at last night ‘s effort to stop health reform with prayer .
And we thank you , Living God , that you hear in Jesus name , amen .
Lord , we ‘re praying , give them wisdom .
The wisdom that comes down from up above .
For such a time as this we cry out to you !
Lord , right now , we ‘re calling on you .
Oh , Lord , come and come to our senators .
Would you break into their hearts and minds ?
Would you rule over them ?
LOU ENGLE , PASTOR : Let ‘s take hands together and let ‘s pray right now for our leaders , the senators who are in this debate now .
Would you just lift your voices just for a few moments ?
And let ‘s just altogether pray together .
MADDOW : A lot of attention being paid today to the fight within the left over whether or not to support health reform now that it ‘s been so watered down .
I ‘m here to tell you that this is the other side of that fight .
Senators DeMint and Brownback were the headlining politicians at last night ‘s online anti- health reform prayercast .
But the marquee pastor chosen to lead the prayers at the anti-health reform event was Lou Engle .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
ENGLE : We dare to believe today that you overthrow , overrule keys , that you actually rule in the Senate debates even as we pray .
So now we stand before you and worship you .
The God who answers prayer , rise , oh , God .
Hear , show mercy and turn this nation to you , we pray .
In Jesus name , break in — break in at this moment as we lift our voices all across America .
Come , Lord .
Hear from heaven and intervene in Jesus name we pray .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Liberals are debating whether or not it is smart and ethical to have a mandate without a public option .
On the Jim DeMint and Sam Brownback side of the aisle , they are approaching this rather differently , as you can see here .
Lou Engle leading the prayer part of the anti-health reform fight with Senators Brownback and DeMint is founder and president of a group called Call to Conscience , as we reported last night .
Call to Conscience describes itself as a movement to bring holiness and purity back to America .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
ENGLE : What happened to California will release a spirit that is more demonic than Islam , a spirit of lawlessness and anarchy .
And a sexual insanity will be unleashed into the Earth .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : It is Mr. Sexual Insanity there who presidential hopefuls , like Senator Jim DeMint and Senator Sam Brownback have turned to as their interlocutor , for killing health care reform maybe not by voting it down , maybe not by filibustering it , maybe not by delaying it to death , maybe not by getting liberals to fight each other to death over it , but killing health care reform through God ‘s intervention .

SEN .
JIM DEMINT ® , SOUTH CAROLINA :
If we have the government making decisions about the most personal and private part of our lives , it is so naive to think that that coverage is not going to include a number of things that cause people of faith a lot of heartburn , whether it ‘s funding abortions , whether it ‘s rationing care , whether it ‘s funding medical marijuana , whether it ‘s euthanasia .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Funding abortions , rationing care , medical marijuana and killing people .
None of which is actually in the bill .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
TONY PERKINS , FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL : The Democratic leadership wants to fund abortion in this bill .
And it ‘s a real tragedy , because abortion is not health care .
DEMINT : It ‘s not about health care .
It ‘s about government control .
SEN .
SAM BROWNBACK ® , KANSAS : It ‘s a debate about life or death .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Also not actually talking about what ‘s in the bill .
But as off the wall as those senators ‘ claims sound about health reform , the senators often sounded almost rational next to the other leaders of this national prayercast .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BROWNBACK : Most people agree with this statement , I ‘m satisfied with my own health care .
I think it costs too much and I ‘m concerned about people that do n‘t have health coverage .
PERKINS : I think that about milk , though , too .
I mean , I think I pay too much for it , but I like it .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : And that penetrating interviewer ‘s name is Tony Perkins .
Tony Perkins is the president of the Family Research Council which does n‘t just produce prayercasts against health reform .
They also produce broadcast ads against health reform .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
They wo n‘t pay for my surgery .
But we ‘re forced to pay for abortions .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : The Family Research Council ‘s Tony Perkins was joined at the prayercast against health reform by James Dobson of Focus on the Family .
Mr. Dobson phoned it in literally to the anti-health reform prayercast and he gave his own interpretation of what he thinks the health reform bill would do .
( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP )
DR . JAMES C. DOBSON , FOCU ON THE FAMILY ACTION : Heavenly Father , the principles of righteousness that you taught us are just being abandoned now by our governmental leaders .
And if they prevail in the measures that they ‘re now considering , even more babies will die .
More than 50 million already have .
And in other measures , the institution of marriage itself , will be destroyed .
( END AUDIO CLIP )
MADDOW : It ‘s amazing that they found room in the health reform bill to abolish marriage .
I mean , what with all the room taken up in the bill by the “ killing the babies ” and the marijuana and the expensive milk being taken away .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
DEMINT : We cannot fall for this idea that we need to keep our faith in a closet and let the country go its own secular way .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : Senator DeMint not falling for that old separation of church and state canard , even as Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , another participant of last night ‘s event , praised , in this case , for power .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
REP .
MICHELE BACHMANN ® , MINNESOTA : Lord , as leaders of our country , Lord , I pray as a stand - in for myself , I pray as a stand - in for others , Lord , who may not have looked to you in all your ways , Father , as leaders .
Father , we want to represent you in the way that we should .
And so , Lord , I ask for forgiveness for that and our own country .
Lord , we know that we have failed and we have n‘t done as we should .
And so that ‘s why now , Lord , we ask for your forgiveness .
And we repent and we turn from that .
And we say , oh , Lord , we deserve your wrath .
But would you yet give our nation mercy ?
We ask for your mercy .
We cry out to you , oh , God .
This is our moment and this is our time .
Lord , we are at the end of ourselves .
And now , we need you .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : At the end of ourselves and now we need you .
And now , I ‘m not sure what we need .
But we have had a bit of a revelation about some of the less well - known opposition to health reform .
We will have much , much , much more on that in just a moment .
Wow .
Talk about burying the lede .
Obama and Clinton went BAD .
ASS on some sucka climate change opposition .
The two 've been chipping away at this Copenhagen summit , but it took them busting down a door to get things " handled . "
Observe :
Via the New York Times , our president announced that there had been an " unprecedented breakthrough " on climate change , negotiated between five major nations last night after taking matters into his own hands .
Forget that the negotiation did n't mean much ( " bare minimum " ) .
When addressing all of this , Obama appeared to have been dusting himself off from dispatching with some bullshit - bullshit .
Some Chinese bullshit :
Mr. Obama 's announcement came late in a day that began with his 11 - minute address to world leaders shortly after noon , and that was filled with brinksmanship and 11th - hour negotiations .
Mr. Obama , whose speech included remarks that appeared pointed at China 's resistance to mechanisms for monitoring emissions reductions , met privately with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao afterward .
But Mr. Wen did not attend two smaller , impromptu meetings during the day that Mr. Obama and United States officials conducted with the leaders of other world powers , an apparent snub that infuriated administration officials and their European counterparts .
Right ?
Who do they think they are ?
Or rather , who the hell do they think they 're trying to pull a fast one on ?
If you do n't know , now you know , China :
The deal eventually came together after a dramatic moment in which Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton burst into a meeting of the Chinese , Indian and Brazilian leaders , according to senior administration officials .
Mr. Obama said he did not want them negotiating in secret .
The intrusion led to new talks that cemented central terms of the deal , American officials said .
For those who can't picture it , a dramatic reenactment :
Do not try to get one past us , or The U.S. , sneaky people .
We will kick in your doors and then your faces in order to reduce everyone 's long - term greenhouse gas emissions .

In 2006 , a team of Spanish and American researchers found the fossil remains of a whale , 4.5 million years old , in Bonares , Huelva .
Now they have published , for the first time , the results of the decay and fossilisation process that started with the death of the young cetacean , possibly a baleen whale from the Mysticeti group .
This is not the first discovery of the partial fossil remains of a whale from the Lower Pliocene ( five million years ago ) in the Huelva Sands sedimentary formation , but it is the first time that the results of the processes of fossilisation and fossil deposition following the death of a whale have been published .
The work of this international group , published in the latest issue of Geologica Acta , is the first taphonomic ( fossilisation process ) study done on cetacean remains combined with other paleontological disciplines such as ichnology ( the study of trace fossils ) .
" Once the whale was dead , its body was at the mercy of scavengers such as sharks , and we know that one of these voracious attacks resulted in one of its fins being pulled off and moved about ten metres .
It remained in this position in the deposit studied , " Fernando Muñiz , one of the study 's authors and a researcher in the University of Huelva 's " Tectonics and Paleontology " research group , currently working as a palaeontologist for the City Council of Lepe , in Huelva , said .
The researchers have described the fossil remains discovered in Bonares , Huelva , at an altitude of 80 metres above sea level and 24 kilometres from the sea , and have studied the main taxonomic characteristics and associated fauna .
The team also created a paleoenvironmental model to explain how the skeleton -- which is incomplete apart from some pieces such as its three - metre- long hemimandibular jaw bones -- was deposited .
The results show that these remains came from a " juvenile whale that died and became buried on the sea floor , at a depth of around 30 - 50 metres , and were subject to intense activity by invertebrate and vertebrate scavengers ( as can be seen from the presence of numerous shark teeth associated with the bones ) , " says Muñiz .
Based on the remains studied , it is hard for the researchers to say whether the cause of death was illness , old age , or attack by a larger predator .
In terms of its taxonomic description , the researchers say this is " difficult , " although the morphology of the scapula ( shoulder blade ) suggests it is " from the Balaenopteridae ( rorqual ) family , belonging to the group of baleen whales from the Mysticeti sub-order , " says the paleontologist .
Dead bodies as a source of nutrients
The occasional presence of a cetacean corpse on the sea floor represents an exceptional provision of nutrients for various ecological communities .
According to recent studies of current - day phenomena , four ecological phases associated with whales have been recognised " that can be partially recognised in the fossil record " -- the presence of mobile scavengers ( sharks and bony fish ) , opportunists ( especially polychaetes and crustaceans ) , sulphophilic extremophiles ( micro organisms ) and hard coral .
Once the bones deposited on the sea floor , free of organic material , were exposed , bivalve molluscs of the species Neopycnodonte cochlear colonised them .
The presence of these bivalves suggests that the process to transform the biological remains after death was " relatively lengthy before it was definitively buried , " explains the researcher .
" The fat and other elements resulting from the decomposition of the organic material would have enriched the sediment around and above the body , and this can be seen in the numerous burrowing structures in this sediment , created by endobiotic organisms , such as crustaceans and polychaete annelids , " adds Muñíz .
The bones were also " used , " not only as a base to which these could attach themselves , but also as food .
According to the paleontologists , the presence of bioerosion structures indicates that the contents of the bones were used as an extraordinary source of nutrients , possibly by decapod crustaceans .
This would be the first known evidence in the fossil record of a whale bone being consumed by decapod crustaceans with osteophagic feeding habits .
The material is currently undergoing in - depth analysis by the authors of the study .
Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin ( Ill. ) blasted Senate Republicans on Wednesday for threatening the chamber 's ability to pass a defense spending bill on time .
The chamber 's second most - powerful Democrat predicted a reading of that spending resolution -- as Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) demanded of Sen. Bernie Sanders ' ( I - Vt. ) single - payer healthcare proposal this afternoon -- could keep the bill from clearing the Senate by Saturday .

That means money could run out for troops abroad , delaying equipment purchases and a proposed military pay increase , and further postpone another extension of unemployment benefits , the senator explained .
" This is no accident , and this is no decision by one Republican from Oklahoma , " Durbin told reporters , before learning Sanders had withdrawn his amendment .
It is unclear whether the day 's dispute could still threaten the Defense bill .
" How in the world can we in good conscience do this at this time of year ? "
Durbin added .
Republicans have stressed since the healthcare debate began this summer that Senate Democrats were moving too fast for their own good .
Many in the GOP have even acknowledged they were actively trying to slow down debate -- a strategy Democrats said comes at the expense of voters .
Sen. Bob Menendez ( D - N.J. ) , speaking alongside Durbin , repeated that line on Wednesday , noting that Coburn 's tactic was merely a microcosm of a larger GOP strategy to set Democrats up for failure .
" It 's become very clear to me , as it should be clear to just about everyone , that everything they 're doing has nothing to do , nothing to do , with helping Americans get affordable healthcare or get jobs , but everything to do , everything to do , with winning the next election , " Menendez said .
" The Republicans have decided their road to electoral victory in 2010 and to poise themselves 2012 is for this president and this Congress to fail . "
" If the tables were turned , Republicans would vilify Democrats as un-American , un- patriotic , un -Democratic .
They would wave the flag , and claim they were the true patriots , " he added , comparing the GOP 's behavior to that of Ebeneezer Scrooge .
" Well this time , they are not .
They are playing politics in its worst form , plain and simple . "
North Korean authorities have said they have arrested a US man who crossed into their territory .
The North 's official KCNA news agency said the man had entered the country from China on 24 December .
There is no official word on the man 's identity .
However there have been reports that Robert Park , a US Christian activist , recently crossed into North Korea .
Colleagues say he wanted to highlight the country 's human rights record and demand the release of prisoners .
" On December 24 , a US citizen illegally entered the country across the North Korea - China border and has been detained .
The person is currently undergoing questioning by a related agency , " KCNA news agency said .
Visions
Associates of Mr Park reported that he had walked into North Korea from China across the frozen Tumen River on Christmas Day , 25 December .
Mr Park , a US citizen of Korean ancestry from Tucson , Arizona , claimed he had seen a vision from God of North Korea 's liberation and redemption , his colleagues said .
They said he walked across the border shouting : " I am an American citizen .
I brought God 's love .
God loves you and God bless you . "
South Korean activists supporting Mr Park say he carried a letter urging the North 's leader , Kim Jong - Il , to free political prisoners and improve human rights in the communist state .
Earlier this year North Korea detained two US journalists on the border with China .
Laura Ling and Euna Lee were sentenced to 12 years ' hard labour but were freed as part of a diplomatic mission spearheaded by former US President Bill Clinton in August after four months in captivity .

Evangelical Christians plan to distribute more than 100,000 free copies of Charles Darwin 's seminal work on the theory of evolution , " On the Origin of Species , " on college campuses this month .
Are the evangelists affiliated with the religious organization Living Waters really spreading the word of Charles Darwin ?
Yes -- but .
" All we want to do is present the opposing and correct view , " says actor Kirk Cameron , a supporter , in a video on the website .
That view , which both precedes and counters Darwin 's theory in the copies of the book they will distribute , has been penned by the organization 's leader , Ray Comfort .
In a 50 - page introduction , no less .
An excerpt :
Keeping in mind that the most intelligent of human beings can’t create even a grain of sand from nothing , do you believe that the “ something ” that made everything was intelligent ?
It must have been , in order to make the flowers , the birds , the trees , the human eye , and the sun , the moon and the stars .
If you believe that , then you believe there was an intelligent designer .
You have just become an unscientific “ knuckle - dragger ” in the eyes of our learning institutions that embrace Darwinism .
But you are not alone if you believe in God .
Which learning institutions may expect Living Waters representatives to show up on their campuses with boxes of the Comfort - introduction edition of " On the Origin of Species " has n't been announced , although Living Waters described the schools as " 100 of America ’s top universities " in an e-mail to the Los Angeles Times .
According to the website , Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort will pass out copies of the book together on Nov. 19 , perhaps here in Southern California .
Charles Darwin's
" On the Origin of Species " was first published 150 years ago , on Nov. 24 , 1859 .
It begins :
When on board H.M.S. Beagle , as naturalist , I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America , and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent .
These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species -- that mystery of mysteries , as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers .
The book , having been in the public domain for quite some time , is also available for free via Project Gutenberg .
With no introduction but Darwin 's own .

“ I take the conventions from the fashion world and apply them to the underclass barnyard animal , ” Rob MacInnis said .
Some of the first animals he photographed belong to Angela and Frazer Hunter , who own a farm overlooking the Northumberland Strait in Nova Scotia .
Luckily , Mr. MacInnis knew the Hunters through a mutual friend .
Had he called them out of the blue with a proposal for a fashion shoot on their organic dairy farm , they might not have been quite as receptive .
“ I would have thought he was crazy , ” said Mr. Hunter .
“ Who wants to take a portrait of an animal ? ”
Instead , he chose to make portraits of barnyard animals .
Or , as Mr. MacInnis puts it , “ The blue - collar animals of the animal kingdom . ”
These are “ animals not left to their own devices , ” he said .
“ They ’re the animals we selected for consumption and production . ”
Mr. MacInnis is n’t the only photographer thinking of animals as portrait subjects .
James Mollison made portraits of apes , and Vincent J. Musi ’s portraits accompanied a story in National Geographic about animal intelligence .
Mr. MacInnis uses a medium - format Hasselblad camera and photographs his subjects under dreamy lighting , much like that used in Glamour Shots or glossy editorial spreads .
Under his lights , cows and chickens possess soulful expressions , their eyes sparkling .
Goats and donkeys are proud , defiant , bashful .
A sheep grins .
There are group portraits , too ; ensembles that he said are intended to recall “ Annie Leibovitz star - studded photo shoots , ” like those in Vanity Fair .
Mr. MacInnis , 32 , was trained as a fine artist at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design .
One of his pictures , “ Opening Night , ” was purchased recently by Leonard and Susan Nimoy .
The animals in this image were photographed separately and then assembled together on stage during the production of the print .
Rob MacInnis
“ There ’s something so startling and tender about it , ” Ms. Nimoy said .
“ Some of the animals are stars in the making and those animals on the left are anxious to come on stage . ”
The Hunters might have had doubts about Mr. MacInnis and the assistants he brought from school .
“ Farmers are fairly conservative in their outlook , ” said Mr. Hunter , remembering the shoot .
“ When you get four or five art students coming to your farm , they certainly look different . ”
But now , the Hunters own a portrait by Mr. MacInnis .
“ He epitomized Davey , ” Mr. Hunter said of the picture Mr. MacInnis took of their Great Pyrenees .
“ Down to a tee . ”
The aspiration of any portrait photographer .
The UK has a relatively good road safety record Some of the world 's poorest countries are to receive a cash injection of £ 1.5 m from the UK government to help improve road safety .
Road accidents are now a bigger cause of death than malaria in developing countries , with one person dying on the roads every 30 seconds .
The funding will pay for pedestrian crossings and better road markings .
It was announced at the first ministerial global road safety summit , which was held in Moscow .
Minister for Development Gareth Thomas said the road safety statistics in developing countries were " shocking " .
" I want to see this funding make a real impact on reducing casualty numbers where it 's needed most .
It will help with implementing basic safety measures , " he said .
" Statistics show that the UK has some of the safest roads in the world .
We must use our expertise to help developing countries meet the safety standards that we take for granted . "
' Change of direction ' Edmund King , president of the Automobile Association ( AA ) , who was in the Russian capital for the summit , urged the governments present to make a commitment .
We have the vaccines for this epidemic , now we need the political will for a decade of action for road safety
Lord Robertson , Make Roads
Safe campaign
" A decade of action is crucial - we will achieve nothing if we do not work together , " he said .
" The UK has a relatively good record on road safety but it is vital that we help the global , as well as local , efforts to cut road carnage . "
Former UK Defence Secretary Lord Robertson , who is chairman of the global Make Roads Safe campaign , said the conference must " signal a change of direction " .
" We know how to make roads safe : better road design and speed management ; helmets and seatbelts ; police enforcement , " he said .
" We have the vaccines for this epidemic , now we need the political will for a decade of action for road safety . "
The funding is being provided by the Department for International Development , which has already given £ 3.5 m for research on improving the design and quality of transport in Africa and Asia .

Is it true or false that when you sit on a jury , you may vote on the verdict according to your own conscience ?
" True , " you say , but then why do most judges tell you that you may consider " only the facts " and that you are not to let your conscience , opinion of the law , or the motives of the defendant affect your decision ?
In a trial by jury , the judge ’s job is to referee the trial and provide neutral legal advice to the jury , beginning with a full and truthful explanation of a juror ’s rights and responsibilities .
But judges rarely " fully inform " jurors of their rights , especially their power to judge the law itself and to vote on the verdict according to conscience .
Instead , they end up assisting the prosecution by dismissing any prospective juror who will admit to knowing about this right , starting with anyone who also admits having qualms with any specific law .

In fact , if you have doubts about the fairness of a law , you have the right and obligation to find someone innocent even though they have actually broken the law !
John Adams , our second president , had this to say about the juror : " It is not only his right but his duty … to find the verdict according to his own best understanding , judgment , and conscience , though in direct opposition to the direction of the court . "
It was normal procedure in the early days of our country to inform juries of their right to judge the law and the defendant .
And if the judge did n’t tell them , the defense attorney very often would .
The nation ’s Founders understood that trials by juries of ordinary citizens , fully informed of their powers as jurors , would confine the government to its proper role as the servant , not the master , of the people .
It was our Constitution that gave us the foundation that enables us to remain a democracy .
The Constitution provides five separate tribunals with veto power  representatives , senate , executive , judges and jury .
Before a law gains the power to punish that law must first pass the test of each constitutionally guaranteed authority .
" Jury nullification of law , " as it is sometimes called , is a traditional American right defended by the Founding Fathers .
Those patriots intended that the jury serve as one of the tests a law must pass through before it assumes enough popular authority to be enforced .
Our constitutional designers saw to it that each enactment of law must pass the scrutiny of these tribunals before it gains the authority to punish those who choose to violate any written law .
Thomas Jefferson said , " I consider trial by jury as the only anchor yet imagined by man , by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution . "
Mr. Jefferson Nock , Albert J. Best Price : $ 4.24 Buy New $ 15.99 ( as of 11:15 EST - Details )
Four decades before Jefferson spoke these words , a jury had established freedom of the press in the colonies by finding John Peter Zenger not guilty of seditious libel .
He had been arrested and charged for printing critical  but true  news stories about the Governor of New York Colony .
" Truth is no defense , " the court told the jury !
But the jury decided to reject bad law , and acquitted .
Why ?
Because defense attorney Andrew Hamilton informed the jury of its rights : he related the story of William Penn ’s trial  of the courageous London jury which refused to find him guilty of preaching Quaker religious doctrine ( at that time an illegal religion ) .
His jurors stood by their verdict even though held without food , water , or toilet facilities for four days .
The jurors were fined and imprisoned for refusing to convict William Penn  until England ’s highest court acknowledged their right to reject both law and fact and to find a verdict according to conscience .
It was exercise of that right in Penn ’s trial which eventually led to recognition of free speech , freedom of religion , and of peaceable assembly as individual rights .
American colonial juries regularly thwarted bad law sent over from mother England .
Britain then retaliated by restricting both trial by jury and other rights which juries had won or protected .
Result ?
The Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution !
Afterwards , to forever protect all the individual rights they ’d fought for from future attacks by government , the Founders of these United States in three places included trial by jury  meaning tough , fully informed juries  in our Constitution and Bill of Rights .
" Bad law "  special - interest legislation which tramples our rights  is no longer sent here from Britain .
But our own legislatures keep us well supplied …
That is why today , more than ever , we need juries to protect us !
Even though it was once the written law , would you vote to convict an escaped slave from the south , return him to his " Master " and to then be punished , maybe by inflicting torture and disfigurement to that escaped slave ?
Your answer is hopefully " NO ! "
But , at one time that was the law .
How about burning a witch ?
Once too that was the law , a bad law and one that should not to be acted upon by our juries .
If these laws were again passed today , how should you vote if on that trial ’s jury ?

" If a juror accepts as the law that which the judge states then that juror has accepted the exercise of absolute authority of a government employee and has surrendered a power and right that once was the citizen ’s safeguard of liberty . "
( 1788 ) ( 2 Elliots Debates , 94 , Bancroft , History of the Constitution , 267 )
Despite the courts ’ refusal to inform jurors of their historical veto power , jury nullification in liquor law trials was a major contributing factor in ending alcohol prohibition .
( Today in Kentucky jurors often refuse to convict under the marijuana prohibition laws . )
Fewer incidents of jury veto actions occurred as time increased after the courts began concealing jurors ’ rights from American citizens and falsely instructing them that they may consider only the facts as admitted by the court .
Researchers in 1966 found that jury nullification occurred only 8.8 percent of the time between 1954 and 1958 , and suggested that " one reason why the jury exercises its very real power [ to nullify ] so sparingly is because it is officially told it has none . "
( California ’s charge to the jury in criminal cases is typical : " It becomes my duty as judge to instruct you concerning the law applicable to this case , and it is your duty as jurors to follow the law as I shall state it to you …
You are to be governed solely by the evidence introduced in this trial and the law as stated to you by me . " )
Today no officer of the court is allowed to tell the jury of their veto power .
To better explain to prospective jurors their rights , an explanation that is not forthcoming from our courts ’ judges , an organization called the Fully Informed Jury Association has been established .
" FIJA " is a national jury - education organization which both educates juries and promotes laws to require that judges resume telling trial jurors " the whole truth " about their rights , or at least to allow lawyers to tell them .
FIJA believes " liberty and justice for all " wo n’t return to America until the citizens are again fully informed of their power as jurors , and routinely put it to good use .
About 18 months ago , armed with a number of pamphlets explaining the importance to each of us in having the courts fully inform juries of their rights , I stood in the Mendocino County Courthouse .
I had been talking about this issue , with courthouse visitors when I was " invited " into Judge James Luther ’s courtroom by two of his bailiffs .
Judge Luther , showed me how in general our courts have eroded .
I was told to stop talking to my fellow citizens about their constitutional rights .
Their right to understand a jury ’s role in the court procedure .
I was told to stop or be arrested for jury tampering .
We can only speculate on why there is a general distrust by judges .
A distrust of our citizen juries to decide on the fairness of laws that are often enacted by self - serving legislators ?
Disrespect for the idea of government " of , by , and for the people " ?
Unwillingness to part with their power ?
Ignorance of all the rights and powers that trial jurors necessarily acquire upon assuming the responsibility of judging a case ?
Actual concern that trial jurors might " misuse " their power if told about it ?
How can people get fair trials if the jurors are told they ca n’t use their consciences ?
If jurors were supposed to judge " only the facts , " their job could be done by computer .
It is precisely because people have feelings , opinions , wisdom , experience , and conscience that we depend upon jurors , not upon machines , to judge court cases .
Why is so little known about what is now called " jury nullification " ?
In the late 1800 ’s , a number of powerful special - interest groups ( not unlike many we have with us today ) inspired a series of judicial decisions which tried to limit jury rights .
While no court has yet dared to deny that juries can " nullify " or " veto " a law , or can bring in a " general verdict , " they have held that jurors need not be told about these rights !
However , jury veto power is still recognized .
In 1972 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the trial jury has an " … unreviewable and irreversible power …to acquit in disregard of the instruction on the law given by the trial judge . "
The pages of history shine upon instances of the jury ’s exercise of its prerogative to disregard instructions of the judge ; for example , acquittals under the fugitive slave law ( 473 F 2dl 113 )
Today thousands of harmless citizens are in prison only because their trial juries were not fully informed , and the U.S. now leads the world in percent of population behind bars !
More prisons are being built than ever before for those whose " crime " affects no one but themselves .
We need to be wary and / or critical of any proposals to " streamline " the jury system , or to create jurisdictions or regulations which " do not require " trial by jury ( two of the means by which your power as a juror is stolen ! )
We now hear about plans to allow a court to find a person guilty of a crime with less then a 120 vote .

raw video ( no audio ) PORTLAND - A terrifying experience for a Portland father as he and his son are separated by the closing doors of a MAX train , leaving the son on the platform and the father stuck on the train .
Tonight the dad is furious .
TriMet tells us they are still trying to find out exactly what happened on board the northbound Green Line train , but what is certain , dad is not happy and says his emergency was ignored by the train operator .
" I thought the doors were going to close on my arm , so I let him go , " said the father , Aaron Bailey .
In surveillance video you can see the 3 - year - old , Aiden Bailey , left the Green Line train .
" You 're son's on one side of the train and you 're on the inside and if that gal had n't been there you can only imagine what would have happened , " said Bailey .
Aiden stayed with the stranger as his dad tried to get off the train and back onto the platform .
" I could not get off that train , those doors would not open when I pushed that button repeatedly , " Bailey added .
Bailey admitted his son pushed the wheelchair ramp button .
When pushed it is supposed to close the train doors , extend the wheelchair ramp , and then reopen the doors .
But the doors never reopened for Aaron .
" They can say it 's a malfunction , but likely it 's not , in my opinion , " said Bailey .
Bailey believes he was ignored by the train operator , even after he repeatedly pushed the emergency call box .
" Of course it was ignored there was no answer on the other end , he did not take responsibility for his passengers , " said Bailey .
TriMet could n't provide KOIN Local 6 many answers as to what happened , including whether it was a malfunction or an operator error .
"
We 're still investigating all the different things .
We 're investigating the door , the ramp , and the audible system , " said Mary Fetsch , a TriMet spokesperson .
You 'll see in the surveillance video that Bailey was reunited with his son after a tense and frightening 7 minutes .
Aiden was safe and he 's learned a very valuable lesson .
" You going to push another button again ? "
Bailey asked of his son , Aiden , who shook his head no .
This all happened on one of TriMet 's Type 4
Max trains , the newest in their fleet .
TriMet says they will inspect all of their Type 4 trains to find out if it is a problem with the trains ' emergency call boxes or wheelchair ramps .
According to Siliconera , Nintendo recently managed to establish a new trademark for videogames and electronic devices under the name of ‘ Zii ’ in Japan .
The trademark was filed on October 30th , but did n’t show up until earlier this week in the Japanese trademark database .
It is unclear what the future use of this trademark might be , if any , though the most obvious speculation would be that it is the name for a successor to the Nintendo Wii .
However , Singaporean consumer electronics producers Creative Technology is known to be working on a media device also known as the Creative ‘ Zii ’ as the successor to the Creative Zen media player .
Whether Creative Technology has already established rights to this name in territories other than Japan is unclear at this point .
UPDATE : Engadget has explored this topic further , and found that this is perhaps merely a renewal of a 2006 Trademark request .
Furthermore , it appears as though Nintendo also possess the Oii , Yii , Bii and Cii trademarks .
Looking sharp and looking for light - Berkeley Lab researchers have engineered a new class of bowtie - shaped devices that capture , filter and steer light at the nanoscale .
These " nano - colorsorter " devices act as antennae to focus and sort light in tiny spaces , a useful technique for harvesting broadband light for color - sensitive filters and detectors .
Currently , optical fibers employ light to transport data with very high bandwidth , but the technique hits a roadblock as light is squeezed into smaller and smaller photonic circuits .
This roadblock is the diffraction limit - a fundamental restriction in concentrating photons into regions smaller than half their wavelength .
In contrast , electronic devices are readily fashioned at nanometer scales ; however , electronic data transfer operates at frequencies far below those for fiber optics , with much lower bandwidth , reducing the amount of data carried .
A recent technology , coined " plasmonics , " crowds electromagnetic waves into metal structures with dimensions much smaller than the wavelength of light for transmitting data at optical frequencies , marrying the best aspects of optical and electronic communications .
A particularly promising class of structures for enhancing this crowding effect is nanoscale optical antennas made of gold , which leverage plasmonic behavior to efficiently capture and confine light in miniscule dimensions .
" Like the antenna on your TV or radio , optical nanoantennas efficiently catch and concentrate energy , but the wavelengths are much smaller , " says Jim Schuck , a staff scientist withn the Molecular Foundry , a U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) national user facility at Berkeley Lab that provides support to nanoscience researchers around the world .
" We 've made the first engineered and nanofabricated stucture for nanoscale light distribution that can ship and manipulate ultra - confined optical information with a knob you can easily tune — the energy or color of light , " says Schuck , who works in the Foundry 's Imaging and Manipulation of Nanostructures Facility .
Molecular Foundry post - doctoral researcher Zhaoyu Zhang , working with Schuck and Nanofabrication Facility Director Stefano Cabrini , fabricated nanoantennas from four equilateral triangles of gold lithographically patterned to create a ' cross ' geometry .
Breaking the symmetry of this cross - shaped device affects its primary resonance mode - a property best illustrated by the shattering of a champagne flute when it encounters a musical tone of the right pitch .
In these cross nanoantennas , the resonant modes correspond to different frequencies , or colors , of light .
" We can now control the plasmonic properties of these devices by introducing asymmetry , and we find red and blue light is literally sent left and right , " says Zhang .
" By pushing the limits of manipulating light in a smaller volume , we can move information to one place or another quickly and efficiently , which is important for fast , color - sensitive photodetection . "
Indeed , shifting the vertically aligned bowtie in the cross nanoantenna just five nanometers left of center generates two resonance modes , producing a two - color filter .
The team further demonstrated this effect by breaking other symmetries of the bowties , leading to a three - color filter .
This symmetry breaking gives scientists the ability to " auto - tune " a device to a desired set of colors or energies , crucial for filters and other detectors .
Using the nanofabrication capabilities available at the Foundry , the scientists plan to explore adjusting the size , shape , and position of the bowties to optimize device properties .
For example , thousands of bowties could be packed in an area less than one millimeter across , enabling large , but ultrafast , detector arrays .
James Schuck and Zhaoyu Zhang at the Molecular Foundary fabricated nano - sized antennae from four equilateral triangles of gold that were lithographically patterned to create a " cross " geometry .
These bowtie - shaped antennae function as nano color sorters , able to capture , filter and steer light at the nanoscale .

" Our findings lend insight into the link between simple symmetry breaking and the coherent coupling properties of localized plasmons , providing a pathway for engineering intricate devices that can control light in extremely confined spaces , " Schuck adds .
A scientific paper reporting this research entitled " Manipulating nanoscale light fields with the asymmetric bowtie nano - colorsorter , " by Zhaoyu Zhang , Alexander Weber - Bargioni , Shiwei Wu , Scott Dhuey , Stefano Cabrini and James Schuck , appears in Nano Letters and is available in Nano Letters online .
This scanning electron image of a nano color sorter with the vertical bowtie antenna shifted 5 nanometers ( nm ) to the left of center .
In ( a ) the bowtie has been exited at 820 nm and in ( b ) at 780 nm .
The two modes are spectrally and spatially distinct while maintaining nanoscale mode volumes .

TUESDAY , Dec. 29 ( HealthDay News ) --
Winter can put a chill on even the most enthusiastic exerciser 's plans .
It 's hard to get motivated to go jogging when you have to sidestep icy patches .
And who wants to go to the gym when you have to scrape the ice off the windshield first ?
But sticking to your exercise program throughout the colder months is beneficial for multiple reasons , experts say .
Not only can physical activity lift your spirits during days of limited sunlight , it can help make sure you 're in good shape when it 's time to pull out those shorts and bathing suits again .
To exercise safely in more challenging conditions , you may need to make some adjustments to your routine , said Tony Breitbach , director of athletic training education at Saint Louis University .
" A change in weather should bring a change to your mindset , " Breitbach said .
" As temperatures get colder ... you need to have a winter sports strategy . "
When exercising outdoors , it 's important to dress properly .
Wear layers that you can peel off as necessary .
Ideally , the layer closest to your skin should be made of a breathable wicking material and not sweat - absorbing cotton .
Then add a layer of fleece or cotton for warmth and , finally , a windbreaker or waterproof outer layer .
Make sure you 've adequately insulated your extremities .
The face , fingers and toes are most likely to get frostbitten .
Pain or tingling in your ears , fingers or toes is a sign that it 's time to come in from the cold , Breitbach said .
And do n't forget a hat .
Substantial body heat is lost through your head .
Though you may feel less thirsty in cold weather , continue to drink water while exercising .
Avoid caffeine and alcohol - based beverages , which can contribute to dehydration .
If you run in the dark , wear reflective clothing so that drivers can see you .
Warming up is extra important when it 's cold outside .
Before leaving home , do some stretching and other exercises to limber up .
Once outside , start with some brisk walking before beginning to jog .
Also watch out for overuse injuries .
Indoor surfaces such as gym floors or concrete can be hard on the knees and can worsen overuse issues .
If the winter blues have extended to your feelings about exercise , get creative .
Find an indoor pool or go to that Pilates class you 've been wanting to try .
Ice skating and cross-country skiing burn lots of calories .
And there 's nothing like a snowball fight with your kids to get your heart pumping .

File - sharers could be jailed under proposed ACTA provisions
Leaked details of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement being negotiated in secret by most of the world ’s largest economies suggest Internet file - sharers could be blocked from accessing the Internet if they are repeatedly accused of sharing copyrighted material , say media and digital - rights watchdogs .
ADVERTISEMENT
And the worst - case scenario could see popular Web sites like YouTube and Flickr shut down because of a provision in the treaty that would force them to monitor everything uploaded to the site for copyright violations .
Internet law professor Michael Geist published details of “ leaked ” portions of the discussions on ACTA on his blog Tuesday , as a new round of ACTA negotiations began in Seoul , South Korea .
The US , along with all the countries of the European Union as well as Japan , Canada , Australia and a handful of other countries , are involved in the negotiations .
“ The provisions would pave the way for a globalized three - strikes and you ’re out system , ” Geist blogged Wednesday , referring to a proposal from copyright holders to have Internet service providers cut off service to anyone accused at least three times of illegally sharing copyrighted material .
“ This means that your entire family could be denied [ access ] to the Internet — and hence to civic participation , health information , education , communications , and their means of earning a living — if one member is accused of copyright infringement , without access to a trial or counsel , ” blogged tech writer and digital - rights supporter Cory Doctorow .
Doctorow also noted that another provision being proposed for the treaty would mean “ that ISPs have to proactively police copyright on user - contributed material .
This means that it will be impossible to run a service like Flickr or YouTube or Blogger , since hiring enough lawyers to ensure that the mountain of material uploaded every second is n’t infringing will exceed any hope of profitability . ”

And , as Geist noted in a follow - up article on Wednesday , the proposed treaty could end up seeing file - sharers jailed for sharing copyrighted material , even if they had no financial gain from the transaction .
Geist wrote that the treaty , as currently proposed , would “ extend criminal enforcement to both ( 1 ) cases of a commercial nature ; and ( 2 ) cases involving significant willful copyright and trademark infringement even where there is no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain .
In other words , non-commercial infringement could lead to criminal penalties . ”
“ The US government appears to be pushing for Three Strikes to be part of the new global IP enforcement regime which ACTA is intended to create -– despite the fact that it has been categorically rejected by the European Parliament and by national policymakers in several ACTA negotiating countries , and has never been proposed by US legislators , ” writes Gwen Hinze at the Electronic Frontier Foundation .

ACTA negotiations were being held entirely in secret until this past May , when the Wikileaks Web site released a 2007 draft proposal .
The Obama administration has resisted attempts to make the negotiations public , though it did make an exemption for a long list of senior executives at major corporations .

In June , the administration announced it would continue the ACTA negotiations started under the previous administration .

A chat with David Goyer , David Goyer interview , FlashForward , Blade , Dark City
Interviews Home / TV Home / Bullz - Eye Home
As the man responsible for the screenplay for “ Dark City , ” David S. Goyer has long since earned his sci - fi stripes , and when you throw in his contributions to the “ comic book movie ” genre ( he wrote all three of the “ Blade ” films , co-wrote “ Batman Begins , ” and contributed the story for “ The Dark Knight ” ) , his street cred is well above board .
Now , however , he ’s picking up considerable respect for his work as the executive producer of ABC ’s “ FlashForward . ”
Bullz - Eye chatted with Goyer in conjunction with the show ’s appearance in the TV Power Rankings , and he discussed the origins of the series , what we can expect in upcoming episodes , and whether or not we ’re even going to find out what the deal is with that damned kangaroo .
Bullz - Eye : Hey , David , how are you ?
David S. Goyer : I ’m good .
How are you ?
BE : I ’m good .
Pleasure to talk to you .
DG : Likewise .
BE : So I understand we had our delay because you are busy directing .
DG : Well , I was .
Yeah , I finished the thing I was doing about 2:00 last night …or this morning .
BE : What episode are you guys working on right now ?
DG : Well , we are filming episodes 11 and 12 .
We cross together because we shoot two at a time .
But I am sort of the in - house director , too , so we were doing some reshoots for episode eight .
So that ’s what I was doing yesterday .
BE : Well , I do n’t know if you had heard , but the reason we ’re talking is because “ FlashForward ” is pretty high up on our TV Power Rankings for Bullz - Eye.com …
DG : Great !
BE : … so we ’re big fans of the show .
So how did Robert Sawyer ’s novel first appear on your radar ?
" I felt that if you are going to deal with this on a serious basis , it felt like seeing a future that was more pressing , six months out , was potentially more dramatic .
It ’s one thing if you ’re worried your wife might cheat on you 21 years from now , or even if you ’re worried you might be killed 21 years from now .
But if it ’s six months from now , I feel like the weight of the future pressing down upon our characters has that much more gravitational force . "
DG : Jessika Borsiczky , one of the producers , we were friends and she had read it .
She might have even picked it up in the bookstore , I ’m not sure , about eight years ago .
She contacted me at the time about possibly doing it as a feature , because I was doing more features back then .
I was really interested in the book and I do n’t know , one thing led to another and it just kind of fell by the wayside .
We never pursued it .
About two years ago , I was unpacking some books , I had moved , and the paperback she had given me fell out of a box .
It was filled with passages that I had highlighted .
And I reread the book and called her up and said , “ You know , this is a really good …we should do this .
Except I think it should be a TV series , because I just think the concept is way too big to deal with in a single movie . ”
And that ’s what happened .
BE : So when the time came to adapt it to a series format , what did you find were some of your greatest challenges ?
DG : Well , in the book , the flash forward takes place about 21 years in the future .
So first and foremost , there was the question of , did we want to be dealing with a future that involves “ Blade Runner ” - like flying cars or what not .
And the other issue was , even though I loved the book , I felt that if you are going to deal with this on a serious basis , it felt like seeing a future that was more pressing , six months out , was potentially more dramatic .
It ’s one thing if you ’re worried your wife might cheat on you 21 years from now , or even if you ’re worried you might be killed 21 years from now .
But if it ’s six months from now , I feel like the weight of the future pressing down upon our characters has that much more gravitational force .
I also was intrigued with the idea of catching up to that future by the end of the first season .
I think that ’s an interesting promise to make the audience .
So those are the primary reasons .
The other thing in the book is that all the main characters in the book are particle physicists .
And I just felt , frankly , from a purely market analysis , that having mainstream audiences not be able to relate to any of the characters might not make the most compelling television .
That being said , one of the characters still remains a particle physicist , and we will be getting into that world .
BE : So how much input did Robert Sawyer have in the adjustment to the TV version ?
Or did you consult him at all when you were doing it ?
DG : Yeah , we did .
He came to Los Angeles .
Brannon Braga and I , who ’s a friend of mine , once I decided I wanted to do it as a TV show , I asked Brannon if he would like to do it with me because I enjoy working with him and he also loves science fiction .
Robert Sawyer came to Los Angeles , Brannon and I pitched , along with Jessica , the changes that we had in mind in order to make it a TV show .
The other thing is that Sawyer wrote it as a closed ended novel , whereas we had to come up with something that could potentially live for five , six , seven years and tell over 100 hours of stories .
So he grasped why we wanted to make the changes .
He approved them ; he signed off on it .
We made an arrangement with him to have him continue to be a signed advisor on the show , and also write an episode .
He ’s actually coming to Los Angeles in another week or so , he ’s going to be writing episode 17 .
So he ’s going to work with the writers in the room as we write the story , write the episode .
BE : Excellent .
Well , from a writing / producing standpoint , what are the challenges of wrangling an ensemble cast in all of their individual fast forwards ?
I mean , like , how far ahead do you have to plan when you ’re working with that ?
DG : The challenges are immense .
Now that we ’re in the midst of writing episode 15 , only now do I realize just how …if I had known how daunting the task was going to be when I set out doing the pilot , I might have taken pause before I decided to dive in .
It ’s very complicated .
We have 11 series regulars .
We have another six or so recurring characters .
Some of them are recurring so much that they are effectively series regulars , like Zoey , who is Gabrielle Union .
It ’s complicated .
You have to weave … I have a lot of respect for Damon and Carlton on “ Lost , ” because they have a lot of different story lines that you have to weave and service .
And sometimes while you are refocusing the spotlight on one character , you have to take the spotlight off another .
You ca n’t take the spotlight off of him that long , or then the audience gets anxious .
So it ’s a constant juggling act .
BE : Speaking of “ Lost ” , were you at all reluctant to cast two people who were known for “ Lost ” on a show that messes with time , kind of like “ Lost ” does ?
DG : You know , when we started casting Sonya Walger , who obviously is on “ Lost ” but is n’t a series regular , and then the Dominic Monaghan thing happened , we gave it a lot of thought .
You know , do we really want to have two actors that were on “ Lost ” on our show ?
At the end of the day , we decided to go for it .
Particularly , we were very enchanted with Dominic and we had a character in mind .
We pitched the character to him and we asked him what he wanted to do .
And essentially what he said was , “ Whatever the opposite of Charlie is , that ’s what I want to play . ”
So if Charlie is a boy and somebody that to a certain extent relegated to Claire ’s babysitter , I want to be the opposite .
And that worked for us with the character .
So , you know , his character stepped on stage in a big way in tonight ’s episode .
He ’s only in three scenes tonight , but I think when audiences see it , or if they have n’t already seen it , they will realize that the character he is playing of Simon is pretty far removed from Charlie .
BE : In fact , I was going to say that , due to the timing , I have not had a chance to watch tonight ’s episode yet .
I ’m on the east coast , so it has already aired , I just have n’t had a chance to watch it yet .
DG : It ’s pretty interesting .
BE : Yeah , I was going to say that , based on the clips , I think it ’s fair to say that Simon is a bit evil ?
DG : I wo n’t say whether or not he ’s evil , but he ’s definitely a controversial character .
There ’s one scene that we did not release a clip of , when you see it you will know what scene I am talking about , it ’s pretty damn shocking .
I wo n’t say whether he ’s evil or not , but he ’s definitely controversial .
" I have a lot of respect for Damon and Carlton on “ Lost , ” because they have a lot of different story lines that you have to weave and service .
And sometimes while you are refocusing the spotlight on one character , you have to take the spotlight off another .
You ca n’t take the spotlight off of him that long , or then the audience gets anxious .
So it ’s a constant juggling act . ”
BE : Music plays a tremendous part in this series .
DG : Yes .
BE : Who is responsible for selecting the songs ?
I presume you have a hand in that yourself , at least to a certain extent .
DG : For good or bad , I ’m the person responsible .
I pick the songs .
BE : Well , I ’ll say that the choice of song in episode four , the opening with Bjork was fantastic .
So how many takes did it require to set up that very first opening scene with the …
DG : The bus ?
BE : Yeah , the bus , the bike crash …all of the above .
DG : Well , the bus going into the water we did twice .
And the bike crash and people falling we did three or four times .
But we were very happy with that sequence and we had the Bjork song in mind , even when we were writing the script .
So we were glad that that worked out .
BE : And I very much liked the use of “ Boogie Shoes . ”
DG : Yeah , “ Boogie Shoes . ”
It ’s funny , I ’ve read everything from people saying they love the song choice to they do n’t like the song choice .
It just depends .
I mean , we used Jeff Buckley in episode three and most people seem to love that choice , but some people are saying they did n’t like it .
Different strokes , I guess .
BE : Well , as a longtime Night Ranger fan , I of course appreciated the use of “ Sister Christian . ”
DG : Thank you .
We continue to use … the other thing that we did in tonight ’s episode is that I had a band that I ’m a fan of – Fuel – cover a David Bowie song .
So that was a whole new song that we recorded just for the purposes of the show .
And we ’re actually starting to do that with a couple of other songs .
Later on in the season , we ’re having indie bands cover sort of some old time favorites or things like that .
That ’s kind of fun , too , that we ’re generating new material as well .
BE : Well it ’s funny , actually .
I was going to ask if the reason that you used The Rolling Stones ’ cover of “ Like a Rolling Stone ” was kind of like an end run to get the song without having to pay Dylan prices .
DG : The Stones are more expensive , actually .
BE : Really ?
I ’m surprised .
DG : Yeah .
We ’re using a Dylan song in episode nine , and The Stones are more expensive .
The Stones … I just like that cover .
I think their version of that song is an amazing version .
BE : As far as Janis and Maya , how far into the series did you know Janis ’s sexuality , or how that was going to play out ?
Or was it something that you had had in mind from the very beginning ?
DG : We knew in the pilot .
BE : Okay .
Should we have known in the pilot ?
DG : Um , no , not necessarily .
Although the ring that Geyer mentions is in the pilot .
If you go back and look closely , you ’ll see that she ’s wearing that ring in the pilot .
You know , I think our issue with Janis and her sexuality is we drop some hints here and there .
As an audience member , I kind of cry foul sometimes when you had a character on the stage for a long time and suddenly just say they are gay .
We thought it was more interesting to maybe drop some hints and then just do it .
But we feel like we laid some groundwork .
She also says in the pilot , “ I do n’t even have a boyfriend now . ”
You can construe it that she is heterosexual from that , but there were definitely hints along the way .
In episode three , Geyer even questions her sexuality .
BE : In the writing process , which came first : the idea that she would be pregnant , or the idea that she would be gay ?
Or do you even remember ?
DG : No , no , no .
They happened at the same time .
That being said , there are plenty of gay women that get pregnant .
BE : Of course .
Now , the warehouse of dolls in the second episode was extremely creepy imagery .
What were the origins of that ?
It actually struck me as something that I would see in a comic book .
DG : Well , you know , of course , we have the burnt doll photo in the pilot , so , again , that was something that we had planned from the pilot onward .
We will get back to some doll imagery later on in the series .
But the other reason they were there was for the “ ring around the rosie , all fall down ” thing that was meant to thematically reflect back on the children in a playground … and , of course , all of the people in the blackout falling down .
BE : I guess the big question the readers have been asking is , what ’s going the happen after the six months are up ?
How long can you extend the story ?
I understand that you kind of laid out your game plan to the network right at the very beginning .
" The first question ( ABC ) asked was , ' Do you have a plan ?
Do you know what caused the blackout ? '
When I said , ' Yeah , and the first season is going to take us to a day past the flash forward date , ' they said , ' Okay , what happens then ? '
And I told them .
I think it would be doing our audience a disservice just to tell them right now what is going to happen .
But I think it ’s pretty cool .
We certainly are n’t going to run out of stories , that ’s for sure . "
DG : We did .
The first question they asked was , “ Do you have a plan ?
Do you know what caused the blackout ? ”
When I said , “ Yeah , and the first season is going to take us to a day past the flash forward date , ” they said , “ Okay , what happens then ? ”
And I told them .
I think it would be doing our audience a disservice just to tell them right now what is going to happen .
But I think it ’s pretty cool .
In some ways I think it ’s cooler than what we ’re doing in the first season .
We certainly are n’t going to run out of stories , that ’s for sure .
BE : Do you read the theories online from the fans ?
DG : We read some of them .
I do n’t have time to read them all .
But every once in awhile , I go online myself , and we have …every Monday , one of the people that works for us sort of culls through all of the online postings and kind of runs down the top ten theories , top ten things people like , top ten things people did n’t like .
Just so we have a broad spectrum sense of what people are saying .
BE : What ’s the most ridiculous theory you have seen ?
DG : Most ridiculous theory I have seen ?
Well , I appreciate people trying to tie it to “ Lost , ” that the anomaly effect , the magnetic effect from “ Lost ” that brought the plane down is what caused the blackout .
Or the nuclear bomb going off at the end of the last season caused the blackout .
But the shows are n’t connected .
BE : One of the other editors wanted to know if anyone has questioned the paradox of the main character ’s plot .
The theory being that , if his investigation is based on the fact that he ’s in charge of the Mosaic in his flash forward , would n’t that future be completely dependent on the fact that he even had a flash forward ?
DG : Depending on what model of the universe and the flow of time you work on , yes .
But we are aware of the potential paradox , we were aware of it when we wrote the pilot .
You know , it ’s interesting , I ’m surprised that some of the posters have n’t … there are a lot of different models of how time works .
There are certainly many more models out there than the predominant postings have indicated .
I ’m actually surprised , given how steeped in science and whatnot a lot of the people online are , that they have n’t gone to some of the other theoretical models .
But , yes , we are well aware of the paradox .
You know , one of the other things people have said is , “ Well , how come no one in their flash forward seems to be aware of the flash forward having happened ? ”
But we actually start to answer that question in tonight ’s episode .
BE : How did you decide who would keep their British accents and who would have to go American ?
DG : You know , we did n’t intend to have so many British people .
Basically , it was who came through the door first .
You know , we cast Joe Fiennes first .
We decided we wanted him to be American .
I had seen him play American before a number of times , I knew he could do a pretty good American accent .
So we decided , alright , he ’s American .
I ’m ashamed to say that Sonya Walger … I did n’t actually realize that the actress in “ Tell Me You Love Me ” was the same actress as in “ Lost . ”
I thought they were two different actresses .
And her accent was quite good in “ Tell Me You Love Me , ” so that happened .
When Jack Davenport and Dominic Monaghan came along , we cast Sonya and Joe first , they said , “ What about playing American ? ”
And I said , “ You ’re too late , our quota has already been filled . ”
BE : Our music editor wanted me to ask you if you could get Shohreh Aghdashloo to say more things on the show … anything , really … just because her voice is so fantastic .
DG : Your music editor will get their wish .
She reappears at least twice in the first season .
We ’ve already filmed her next appearance .
And she says a lot .
BE : Now , she was in Hong Kong , is that correct ?
DG : Well , we did n’t state that .
It depends how well you know Hong Kong .
BE : I do n’t know it that well , but my understanding is that there is some familiar architecture in that shot .
DG : Yeah , it would seem to be …it certainly seems like she is in Hong Kong , at least if you know the architecture of Hong Kong .
BE : Did you always decide from the get - go that you were going to have an episode that kind of focused on the government ’s reaction to the flash forward ?
DG : Absolutely .
That was planned from day one .
And I thought it was interesting because there are a lot of people posting online , saying how is it that only this one small bureau is investigating the blackout , which of course we never intended .
But there is only so much you can do in a couple of 42 minute episodes .
So obviously , by the time you get to episode five , you see that that ’s not the case at all .
That many , many , many agencies are investigating .
And we will meet some of the people from those other agencies in future episodes .
BE : And way to bring the Nazis into it .
You can never go wrong by having a Nazi as a bad guy .
DG :
They are the all purpose villain , I guess .
Look , we wanted to do …I ’m half Jewish , and we wanted to put Mark in a really difficult moral conundrum , which is , what if this guy has information that could prevent another blackout ?
Do we make a deal ?
And he was going on faith , you know , to a certain extent that …of course , the other thing having been said is it ’s not to say that the government could n’t try to revoke being repatriated , if the information did n’t pan out .
BE : Like I was saying , I have n’t seen tonight ’s episode yet .
Has there been any further movement on the identity of Suspect Zero ?
DG : You know , I get some of the episodes blurred .
I know there is significant movement in eight and nine on Suspect Zero .
I ’m trying to remember if there is …you will find out who Suspect Zero is by the end of the first season .
But …yeah , I just ca n’t remember .
I do n’t know if there is Suspect Zero tonight .
We have a lot of different avenues of the investigation going on .
So we do n’t always have core movements happening on every single avenue in every episode .
But there is definite significant movement within the next few episodes .
BE : Can you speak a little bit about Marc ’s departure ?
Was that something that was a surprise to you or was it his decision ?
DG : You know , we had always talked about him being on short term .
I had worked on shows before , but the truth is that the job of a show running is definitely too big for one person .
So I always needed a number two .
Originally , I had hoped it would be Brannon , but Brannon could n’t get out of “ 24 ” because he was contractually obligated .
So I started looking around for somebody to help me run the room .
But now that we ’ve got things up and running … the other issue is that one of our most senior writers , Lisa Zwerling , found out she was …well , she was significantly pregnant by the time we started , and she had to go on maternity leave after six weeks .
She was the co-show runner on “ E.R. ” for the last few years .
So she was out of the room for ten weeks , and she came back and was capable of picking up more of the reigns .
And Marc wanted to do other things .
It was kind of a combination of things , her coming back from maternity leave .
BE : Can you speak to if there are any seemingly minor characters who are going to become major in the next few episodes ?
DG : Minor characters that are going to become major .
You mean that we have n’t seen yet ?
BE : Or characters that have been kind of in the background who are going to become more important than we realize .
DG : Definitely .
You ’re going to meet …well , there is a character in a little bit named Al Gough , who is one of the other FBI agents , who is in a lot of this episode and pretty much takes center stage the next episode .
We ’re going to meet another character the next episode who becomes pretty significant by the end of the season .
I ’m trying to think .
A lot of our “ recurring ” characters , like Barry Shabaka Henley , who plays an FBI agent .
He is sort of African - American , kind of jowly faced .
He is in and out of the first five episodes .
He has a much bigger role later on in the season .
They did that on “ The Wire ” a lot , too .
I always kind of liked that when they did that .
You would have people in the background that would kind of come to the forefront later on .
I will say that we meet a major , major player at the end of episode eight , that has n’t shown up on stage yet .
He is a very , very significant player in the series .
BE : And can you tell me what ’s up with the kangaroo ?
DG : The kangaroo is in tonight ’s episode .
I ca n’t tell you what ’s up , but the kangaroo came back and will continue to come back .
BE : Will we get resolution on that by the end of the season ?
DG : We ’re hoping to .
We have a plan to .
I think it ’s going to be kangaroo dependent .
I mean , literally , there are not that many trained kangaroos , and we ’re hoping to schedule it right .
So hopefully , pending the kangaroo ’s schedule , yeah .
BE : And I just have a couple more , mostly just about your solo stuff , if you do n’t mind .
DG : I ’ll tell you what I can .
A couple I ca n’t say anything .
BE : Oh , I understand .
First , I just want to say I ’m a big JSA fan , so I loved your work on that series .
DG : Thanks .
One day I hope to get back to comics .
BE : Were there any characters from the Golden Age that you personally wanted to bring back that you did n’t have a chance to ?
DG : I ’m sure there are , but it ’s been so long since I ’ve been thinking JSA I would have to give it some thought .
I mean , I brought the character back , but I would have liked to have done more with Spectre .
BE : What was the experience of working on " Threshold " like ?
Did you have visions for what season two would have been ?
DG : We did .
I mean , the problem with " Threshold " was just , unfortunately , I think CBS was never that comfortable with it being a serialized show .
And it was always intended to be a serialized show .
And once we got going into the series , they wanted episodes to be more closed ended .
And they have had a lot of success with that , and we had n’t really designed it for that , so it felt like we were stalling .
And I think the audience unfortunately sensed that as well .
But in terms of the overall arc of the show , we had always intended or planned to have …it was three stages .
It was “ Threshold , ” “ Foothold , ” “ Stranglehold . ” Meaning “ Threshold ” is contact , “ Foothold ” is the aliens get a foothold , and “ Stranglehold ” is the aliens actually overthrow the indigenous population and become the overlords .
And we were actually planning on changing the title of the show , based on that plan .
So it goes from contact , to they ’re here , to now we are fighting a resistance battle .
But obviously we never got that far .
BE : Which do you think is more likely to come out on DVD , " FreakyLinks " or " Sleepwalkers " ?
DG : At this point , probably “ FreakyLinks , ” because I know they have sort of been re-airing it online or on fear .
net or something like that .
I ’ll be honest , I really did n’t have much …
“ Sleepwalkers ” I was actually involved in with all of the episodes .
“ FreakyLinks ” I left before the pilot even filmed .
I was not happy where that show went .
BE : Oh , really ?
DG : Definitely not .
BE : Why ?
What did n’t go right ?
DG : It ’s not what we intended .
If you were to read the original pilot that I co-wrote with Gregg Hale , it is a much different show than what is out there .
BE : What is the status of “ Super Max ” ?
I am sure you get asked that every other day , if not every day .
DG : Yeah , the status is Warner Brothers is rethinking their whole approach to the DC universe .
They still have n’t definitively decided on exactly what they are doing .
There was some talk about spinning Green Arrow off into a solo movie and to make “ Super Max ” something else .
They just have n’t come to a decision on how they are going to handle all of this .
BE : Now , you did a “ Flash ” script once upon a time , too , did n’t you ?
DG : I did , and sadly it is dormant and orphaned right now .
BE : So now what do you actually have in the works that looks like it ’s going to finally get made ?
Because I know you ’ve got a lot of stuff on IMDb that they like to throw your name onto .
DG : Well , I think the two most pressing things are I ’ve been working on a new “ The Invisible Man ” with Universal .
Kind of a reimagining of the Invisible Man , like Stephen Sommers reimagined “ The Mummy . ”
And it looks like Sony is going to resurrect …
I did a “ Ghost Rider ” script about a decade ago .
They are going to resurrect that , retool it , and possibly use that as kind of a reboot for the next age .
Those are kind of the next two immediate things that are happening .
BE : Are you still working with “ Y : The Last Man ” at all ?
DG : Yeah , in the background .
We ’re trying to get that made .
We ’re trying to possibly see if we can do it as a TV show .
We ’ll see .
Although right now , I admit I ’m pretty damned busy with what ’s been going on with “ FlashForward . ”
BE : I would love to see that as a TV show .
DG : Me , too !
Unfortunately , I have arrived at my destination , so I am going to have to …
BE : Perfect timing .
That was actually my last question , anyway .
It ’s been great talking to you , David , and thanks again .
I really appreciate you taking the time .
You ’re welcome .
Bye !
There are seven wonders of the world , but most of them were already destroyed either by the hands of humans or by the cruel passing of time .
And last year a group of some Russian TV - channels , newspapers and radio stations hold an official opinion poll and discovered what kinds of real wonders Russia has .
Anyone could participate in the poll taking votes via internet or SMS services .
So , the seven best - looking and really fascinating places were chosen .
Here they are :
The Baikal Lake
This lake is situated in Eastern Siberia and considered to be the deepest lake in the world as well as the biggest freshwater tank on the Earth .
It is 1500 meters deep ( ~5000 feet ) .

The view is really enthralling .
Valley of the Geysers
The landmark is located on the Kamchatka peninsula and comprises of hundreds living geysers .

A few words from their founder , Dominik :
We sponsored the TSL for two reasons , because StarCraft is the best game and it deserves big tournaments , and because we strongly believe that everyone who likes StarCraft should try Poker .
It 's similar to a challenging RTS , but one where you can win money too .
The best thing about Poker is that it 's easier to be successful than StarCraft .
You do n't have to be one of the top ten non-Koreans .
You just have to beat the players at your table .
I 'm convinced that even someone who only understands StarCraft from a fan 's perspective ( and is " too slow " to even be C on ICCup ) can still become a great poker player .
Many big and small names from the StarCraft community now call Poker their hobby , or even their profession .
So we ’d be happy if the sponsorship were also a success for our poker community , and would love it if you at least gave PokerStrategy .com a try !
For legal reasons , we sadly have to exclude all US citizens / residents from our offers .
But our most important message to the TeamLiquid community is this : enjoy the fantastic TSL – we surely will !

This is a “ draft ” of our ( my and QuestionCopyright.org ‘s ) first Minute Meme .
A draft because the audio track is a placeholder , and we ’re eager to hear what all you musicians out there can do with it .
Also a draft because we need to make a fancier , more informative page than just this post here !
But what is the Internet for , if not to hastily post creative work by the seat of your pants ?
There are some blank credits at the end for “ Arranged and Recorded by ” and “ Sound Design . ”
Any interested musicians / sound designers can re-release the whole thing with their own tracks and appropriate credits .
Add and remove credits as needed ( but do n’t remove mine ! ) .
If you do n’t add sound effects , cut out the “ Sound Design ” card ; if you want to credit additional voices , add a card for them .
I used the fonts Gill Sans and Gill Sans Ultra Bold .
Be sure to keep the CC - BY - SA symbols on all the credits – you ’ll be releasing your modifications under the same license .
Here are the lyrics :
Copying is not theft .
Stealing a thing leaves one less left
Copying it makes one thing more ;
that ’s what copying ’s for .
Copying is not theft .
If I copy yours you have it too
One for me and one for you
That ’s what copies can do
If I steal your bicycle
you have to take the bus ,
but if I just copy it
there ’s one for each of us !
Making more of a thing ,
that is what we call “ copying ”
Sharing ideas with everyone
That ’s why copying
is
FUN !

The Android explosion is well underway -- and now , the platform 's app market is starting to reflect the growth .
The Android Market has just reached 20,000 apps , according to the app - watchers at AndroLib .
The numbers show Android doubling its app selection in a matter of about three months , jumping from 10,000 apps in September to 20,000 in December .
While the 20k - figure may not be as impressive in sheer size as the App Store 's 100,000 - strong selection , that kind of growth is certainly a promising sign for the platform 's future .
Still , size is n't everything ; it 's what you can do with it that counts .
The Android Market is rapidly proving it has the goods to get the job done -- and I 'm not just talking about Google Goggles , either .
Mobile Defense : An Android App You Need
The latest cool program to become widely available for Android owners is a must - have security utility called Mobile Defense .
The app has been released in limited beta for some time , but it was previously accessible only to users on the T - Mobile network .
Now , Mobile Defense has opened its arms to Sprint and Verizon , too , meaning those of us with the Motorola Droid , Samsung Moment , and HTC Hero can get in on the action .
From what I 've experienced of the program so far , I would highly suggest you do .
Mobile Defense , put simply , helps you protect your Android phone in case it 's lost or stolen .
The app runs quietly in the background of your device , using a negligible amount of memory and battery power ( in fact , its creator says the program employs practically no resources unless you 're actively using it ) .
When you install the app , you set up a secure account that allows you to log on from the Mobile Defense Web site .
Then , anytime you can't find your phone , you simply sign in , click " Connect to Phone , " and you 're locked into your Android device .
Mobile Defense will pinpoint your phone 's location down to an exact address , even displaying it for you on an embedded interactive map .
Within the same dashboard , you can remotely lock or unlock your phone and sound a loud " scream " ( think obnoxious car alarm noise ) through your phone 's speaker .
Android Security Power
One reassuring aspect of the Mobile Defense app is that it does n't rely solely on GPS data to track your phone :
It uses a combination of GPS , cell tower triangulation , and known Wi-Fi hotspots to find and connect to your Android device .
What 's more , if someone tries to swap out your SIM card , Mobile Defense will alert you immediately via e-mail .
It 'll even give you the subscriber ID and phone number tied to the new card and allow you to issue " emergency commands " that your friendly neighborhood thief will be hard - pressed to block .
The greatest power of Mobile Defense , however , is still on the way .
The app will eventually allow you to remotely back up and then wipe all of your data from your device , a functionality that could prove invaluable in the event of theft .
The remote backup / wipe option was actually available on an earlier incarnation of Mobile Defense , but the developers temporarily pulled it for re-engineering .
( The program is still in beta , so these things do happen . )
Android Security Comparisons
There are a few other tracking / security utilities available in the Android App Market , and I 've experimented with them all .
Aside from its ease of use and consistent effectiveness , Mobile Defense stands out to me for its intelligent implementation -- while other Android security apps announce their presence upon the phone 's startup , Mobile Defense does n't display so much as an icon in the notification panel or even program list -- and also for its problem - free performance .
Other security apps dragged down my phone 's performance and caused various issues with my system ; Mobile Defense has yet to cause me a single moment of grief .
Oh , and I should also mention : Mobile Defense is free .
Its developers have said they may eventually charge for some premium services , but the basic functionality available now , they 've indicated , should remain available without a fee .
Is Mobile Defense 100 percent foolproof ?
Of course not .
But does it provide a powerful way to find your phone if lost -- and substantially increase your chances of protecting your data if stolen ?
Absolutely .
For a free app that runs in the background without hogging any resources , those are odds I 'm more than willing to embrace .

It was Mr Alastair Campbell who first formulated the 11 - day rule .
This was that , if a story in the papers lasted for this period , it was important , but that it was forgotten afterwards .
By this test , the story about Mr Nick Griffin and the BBC had lasted longer than the allotted span .
I am fairly sure that it will quickly be forgotten .
Most people , by the way , do not use " story " in the manner in which media folk commonly use it .
The ordinary usage takes in fiction , even fantasy and exaggeration .
Just so , one might say .
It is an overlapping sort of word : what the late William Empson once called a type of ambiguity .
An account of Mr Griffin and the corporation was a story indeed , exaggerated in all respects .
It has come to something – quite what I am not sure –when our two leading journals of liberal opinion can lead their front pages with a television programme of the utmost inconsequence .
There it is .
And with that we can pass on to other matters , such as the postal strike .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Those of us who were around in the 1970s remember the industrial unrest of 1978 - 79 , when a hapless James Callaghan lost Labour the election to Margaret Thatcher .
In fact this was neither wholly accurate nor entirely fair to Callaghan .
But that version of history is what most people believe .
Similarly , many writers now say that the Profumo affair of 1963 " brought down " Harold Macmillan , the Conservative government of that day , or both : whereas Macmillan packed it in several months afterwards , and the Tories , under a new prime minister , went on for well over a year , and very nearly won the general election .
Likewise , the Labour government of 1979 did not lose the vote in the House of Commons because of the chaos of the previous winter , but because the Scottish Nationalists and a few others withdrew their support from a minority government .
They did this because the Government was paralysed by the result of a referendum on Scottish devolution .
Even so , there was a broad truth in the view that the unions " brought down " Callaghan ; just as there was in the view that Profumo finished off Macmillian .
I read in the last couple of days that Mr Gordon Brown had tried to detach himself from the unions in the grand project of New Labour inaugurated by Mr Tony Blair and the present Prime Minister .
This does not seem to me to be entirely correct .
For the past 12 years and more , Mr Brown has tried to separate himself from Mr Blair over the unions .
His friends and admirers – a declining band , but that cannot be helped – claimed that he enjoyed the warmest relations with assorted Terrys , Kevins and Daves .
There was even a close connection with the apparatchiks of No 10 and one or two functionaries of the huge union Unison .
Before he became Prime Minister in summer 2007 , Mr Brown cultivated this relationship .
He did so because he wanted to detach himself from Mr Blair , and he indicated that he was really an old Labour man at heart .
More than this , he wanted to secure a preponderance of union votes in the electoral college in any future contest for Labour leader .
As things turned out , no such election was necessary .
Mr Brown was crowned by acclamation .
It needed only a wreath of laurel to make the triumph complete .
Alas !
In September 2007 , Mr Brown might have won a fourth victory for his party .
Instead , he is looking at a Conservative majority of over 100 , or so the opinion
polls now claim , which I must say I do not altogether believe .
But even by the most optimistic forecasts , from Mr Brown 's point of view , Labour is heading for dry dock .
It is perfectly reasonable to suppose that , with stormy waters in store , the good ship Cameron will have only four or five years on active service .
But by then , Mr Brown will have other matters with which to occupy his attention .
The question is : what does the Labour Party , what does Mr Brown , do now ?
The standard answer , or answers , I have given already in previous columns .
The Labour Party does not get rid of its leaders : the exception was George Lansbury in 1935 .
Still less does it replace its prime minister : the exception , semi-exception , was Mr Blair , who was succeeded by Mr Brown .
My own view is that , with Mr Brown having been imposed on the British public in the old Tory style , the voters would not be prepared to have another dubious character foisted on them without the intervention of a general election .
But what could the poor old voters do about it ?
They could , I suppose , simply refuse to vote for a Labour candidate in even greater numbers than they are threatening to do already .
This is an attitude I find sympathetic .
But it is probably lacking in realism .
Never underestimate the attractions of the new .
Mr Brown was once new , as Prime Minster , in September 2007 , when everyone now says he would have won ( though I doubt it myself ) .
Six months is a good period in which a new prime minister can play himself or herself in .
Do not undervalue Ms Harriet Harman .
Whenever I mention her , my friends among the political editors and parliamentary sketch writers fall about with exaggerated hilarity .
She would , they say , be the equivalent of Mr Michael Foot in 1983 .
But times have changed .
Desperate times require remedies of last resort .
A six - month interval before a general election brings us to January and the new year .
Mr Brown 's period at No 10 has been marked by a series of tests imposed partly by himself ( or those in Downing Street ) and partly by others , chiefly in the newspapers .
And so , we are told , such - and - such a by - election will prove crucial to the success of Mr Brown 's government and to his future as Prime Minister .
Or there is some other event upon which the wellbeing depends .
The by - election is duly lost ; or the event refuses to take place , or turns out differently from what Mr Brown had expected .
Mr Brown is surprised , or disappointed .
Sorry about that , he says ; try again ; better luck next time .
He is the Tommy Cooper of No 10 ; with the difference that the late comedian exercised considerable skill in his act .
Perhaps Mr Brown can inspire an underlying affection , as the magician did , though I doubt it .
He has certainly had his share of bad luck .
Recently , Mr Brown accepted Sir Thomas Legg 's recommendation on MPs ' expenses , as Mr David Cameron did likewise .
The British public warmly applauded this application of lynch – or Legg – law .
There was nothing to choose between Mr Cameron and Mr Brown in this respect .
And yet the voters seem to disapprove of Labour MPs in relation to expenses more strongly than they do they Conservatives .
Moreover , the Labour members are more discontented with their leader than the Tories are with theirs .
Labour expenses , combined with the postal strike , may just tip the balance against Mr Brown .
But despite everything that is going wrong , I would not bet on it .
In test after test , imposed by himself or by others on his behalf , Mr Brown fails , and he is still there .
He is like one of those old - fashioned toys that have lead in their bottoms .
But the Labour benches are in a fatalistic mood .
To them , another prime minister would not make much difference – and a new one might even make things even worse .
The Box
( 2009 )
The box is a test administered by aliens through Mr. Steward ( Frank Langella ) .
Mr. Steward assumes this position after being killed by a lightning strike by " those who control it " and coming back to life .
Human extinction is mentioned , so you would assume if humans fail the test , aliens will make humans extinct .
Norma ( Cameron Diaz ) and Arthur ( James Marsden ) are married with a son , Walter .
They are presented the box by Mr. Steward .
They are told if they press the button , they 'll get a million dollars , but someone they do n't know will die .
If they do not press the box , then it will be taken to another person and they 'll receive the same offer .
Norma presses the button .
When the button is pushed , a man shoots his wife in the heart , and the police find that couple 's daughter locked in their bathroom .
Norma and Arthur get the million dollars , and Mr. Steward takes the box and tells them it will now be given to someone they do n't know .
After trying to determine who Mr. Steward his , and being confronted with countless people that are under Mr. Stewards mind control , Arthur runs into the man who shot his wife .
The man tells him that his wife pressed the button , and that he ended up shooting her for his own daughter 's sake ( this will make sense shortly ) .
Walter ends up being kidnapped by Mr. Stewards " employees " ( those he has mind control over ) .
Norma and Arthur find themselves back in their home with Mr. Steward there as well .
He informs them that Walter is safe , but he is now blind and deaf .
They are presented 2 more options .
Option 1 is to live with Walter , blind and deaf , with the one millions dollars .
Option 2 is for Arthur to shoot Norma in the heart , and Walter will regain his sight and hearing and the million dollars will be put into an interest bearing account for him to receive when he turns 18 .
It is at this point they realize Walter is upstairs locked in the bathroom .
Norma convinces
Arthur to shoot her in the heart .
( As he does it we cut to a scene where another couple is pushing the button ) .
Walter regains his sight and hearing .
This is the same situation that the previous man and wife were in when Norma pushed the button .
So the previous person to press the button is the one who dies .
The only way to live if you press the button is if the next person does not press it .

Chase and Citibank announced via their websites that they are no longer participating in Federal Deposit Insurance Company ( FDIC ) Transaction Account Guarantee Program .
Both banks are still insured under the general FDIC program , however .
What is the FDIC ?
It ’s the government entity that makes it safer to keep your money in the bank rather than stuff it in a mattress .
In the case of a bank failure , your funds deposited in that failed bank are guaranteed and will be returned to you .
From the FDIC website :
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) is an independent agency of the United States government that protects funds depositors place in banks and savings associations .
FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government .
Since the FDIC was established in 1933 , no depositor has ever lost a single penny of FDIC - insured funds .
What does dropping the Transaction Account Guarantee protection mean to you ?
Actually , you should be pretty scared .
Taking a protection away from your hard earned funds is not a good thing .
Nor is it a good sign of the health of these banks .
Dropping out of the program means that the banks do n’t have to be quite as strict with their banking procedures .
What is the difference between coverage under the Transaction Account Guarantee Program and FDIC ’s general deposit rules ?
With the general deposit rules , any account which is covered under the general rules is covered up to $ 250,000 but above this amount , the funds are not covered .
If funds are covered under the Transaction Account Guarantee Program , funds exceeding $ 250,000 are still covered .
It ’s sort of double protection .
The fact that Chase is dropping out is not exactly a secret , since they ’ve posted it on their website , but I have n’t really seen it in the news or a press release .
From Chase ’s website :
Beginning January 1 , 2010 , JPMorgan Chase Bank , N.A. will no longer participate in the ( FDIC’s ) Transaction Account Guarantee Program .
As a result , after December 31 , 2009 , funds held in non-interest bearing transaction accounts * and IOLTA , IOLA and IOTA accounts will no longer be guaranteed in full under the Transaction Account Guarantee Program .
However , these accounts will be insured up to $ 250,000 per depositor under the FDIC ’s general deposit rules …
There is also a link on Citibanks ’s website as well .
Note : Beginning January 1 , 2010 , Citibank will no longer participate in the FDIC ’s Transaction Account Guarantee Program .
Thus , after December 31 , 2009 , funds held in noninterest - bearing transaction accounts ( non-interest and interest - bearing checking accounts ) will no longer be guaranteed in full under the Transaction Account Guarantee Program , but will be insured up to $ 250,000 under the FDIC ’s general deposit insurance rules .
What are all these rules that a bank does n’t have to follow if they drop out of the program ?
If a bank decides not participate in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program , they no longer have to certify that they compliant in section 4 ( k ) of the Bank Holding Company Act ( 4 ( k ) .
What are 4 ( k ) compliant activities ?
Any bank not participating in 4 ( k ) compliant activities means a bank can invest in any company , risky or not , or financial in nature or not .
Which means they are taking your money and perhaps gambling with it .
They are just trying to duck out of government regulation :
( k) ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FINANCIAL IN NATURE . –
(1) IN GENERAL .
–Notwithstanding subsection ( a ) , a financial holding company may engage in any
activity , and may acquire and retain the shares of any company engaged in any activity , that the
Board , in accordance with paragraph ( 2 ) , determines ( by regulation or order ) –
( A ) to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity ; or
( B ) is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or
soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally .
So what about you ?
Are you going to keep your money in Chase or Citibank ( if it ’s there ) ?
Are you alarmed by this shift in money protection programs disappearing ?

A geologist on trial for setting off home - wrecking earthquakes during experiments to produce clean energy has told a court he was surprised by the strength of the tremors .
But Markus Haering , who designed the geothermal project in Basel , Switzerland , rejected allegations that he deliberately damaged properties and said local people knew the risks .
Haering 's company Geopower had been working with the authorities in Basel to try to convert the heat in deep - seated rocks into electricity .
The deep drilling underground caused a series of earthquakes in 2006 , including one of 3.4 magnitude .
Haering could be sentenced to up to five years in prison .
Geopower has paid around 9 million Swiss francs ( $ 9 million ) in compensation for cracked walls and similar damage on nearby houses and other buildings .
Haering said those involved had " very little knowledge of seismicity " before drilling began in the Petit - Huningue area of the city .
A verdict is expected next week .

Republicans said they would resist the legislation with every tool available , and they denounced the deal struck on Saturday .
“ This process is not legislation , ” said Senator Tom Coburn , Republican of Oklahoma , referring to a variety of special - interest provisions .
“ This process is corruption .
It ’s a shame the only way we can come to a consensus in this country is to buy votes . ”
Mr. Baucus defended the assistance for those affected by the asbestos site in his state .
“ The people of Libby were poisoned and have been dying for more than a decade , ” he said .
“ New residents continue to get sick all the time .
Public health tragedies like this could happen in any town in America .
We need this type of mechanism to help people when they need it most . ”
Items were inserted into the bill by the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada , to get or keep the support of various lawmakers .
He needs support from all 60 members of his caucus to overcome a Republican filibuster and pass the bill by his self - imposed Christmas deadline .
Senator Ben Nelson , Democrat of Nebraska , was the critical final Democrat to endorse the bill .
He obtained tighter restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion , and additional Medicaid money and other benefits for his state .
Another item in the package would increase Medicare payments to hospitals and doctors in any state where at least 50 percent of the counties are “ frontier counties , ” defined as those having a population density less than six people per square mile .
And which are the lucky states ?
The bill gives no clue .
But the Congressional Budget Office has determined that Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Utah and Wyoming meet the criteria .

“ Josh Klinghoffer has been playing with the group for a couple of months now , ” a source close to the band explained .
“ Optimistically , the Peppers are trying to lock down a replacement for John , who has apparently quit .
“ Mentally , John checked out a long time ago .
He ’s interested in doing his own thing , his own albums – the whole big rock band machinery just does n’t appeal to him anymore . ”
As a session guitarist , Klinghoffer has worked with artists including Perry Farrell , Tricky , PJ Harvey , Neon Neon and Gnarls Barkley .
He also played with Frusciante on several of the guitarist ’s solo projects .

Janet Porter says it is “ time to fight for your lives ! ” and lays out five ways to do so , with numbers 4 and 5 being prayer and fasting , which are necessary because America “ made the choice of death last November ” and is therefore cursed for electing Barack Obama :
4. Fast .
That ’s right .
High octane prayer – a weapon they do n’t have .
Have one more Christmas cookie , and then let God know we ’re serious about our desperate need for Him to intervene and rescue us from the consequences of our actions .
America made the choice of death last November , and as Deuteronomy 30:19 tells us , there are some consequences for such action .
They ’re called curses .
The good news is there is a way to break a curse .
It ’s called repentance , which leads me to my next point .
5. Reserve your calendar for May 1 , 2010 .
We ’re going to meet at the Lincoln Memorial at sunrise for “ May Day – A cry to God for a nation in distress . ”
We ’re not gathering to do cartwheels for the media in hopes that they ’ll give us a 20 - second sound bite .
Our goal is n’t to impress the Washington elite .
We are gathering at our nation ’s capitol to ask for an audience with the Creator of the universe .
As we step out in obedience , following the checklist God gave us in 2 Chronicles 7:14 to humble ourselves , repent and pray , to seek God ’s face and turn from our wicked ways , it is our hope that God will look down and see enough of a remnant to hear us from heaven , forgive our sins and heal our land .
Nashville Predators fans are downright giddy these days .
A lousy start has been turned around remarkably , first with a seven - game winning streak in mid-November , and currently with a 6 - 0 - 1 stretch that has lifted them up among the Western Conference leaders like Chicago , San Jose and Los Angeles .
In the background , however , a tiny voice wonders - are they playing above their heads ?
Are the Predators really this good , or is this just a hot streak full of fortunate bounces that will surely be balanced out in the near future ?
Let 's take a look at what the numbers might tell us ...
In the past I 've used a method called " Pythagenpuck " ( PDF ) to compare the actual points percentage ( points earned in the standings as a fraction of the total possible ) of various teams to what would be expected based on their Goals For and Against .
Over the course of time it proves to be a very reliable indicator of team performance .
The basic idea is that if you see a team with a points percentage well above or below the Expected value , one should anticipate that going forward they 'll fall back in line , unless there 's a significant reason for the Goals For & Against ratio to change ( say , due to major roster or coaching changes ) .
This model excludes points in the standings earned by winning a game in the shootout , as that 's basically a coin - flipping exercise .
You get two points for winning in regulation or OT , one point for losing in OT or the shootout , and zero for losing in regulation .
So what does Pythagenpuck tell us about the Nashville Predators this season ?
As we all know , the Preds got off to a slow start this season , going 2 - 5 - 1 in the opening weeks as the team struggled to score goals , and J.P. Dumont missed action after taking a vicious hit in the second period of Game 1 .
After he returned things started looking up on the offensive end , and as Francis Bouillon rounded into shape playing a Top Four defensive role after signing at the end of training camp , the Goals Against began to settle down as well .
The following table lays out how the season has gone , breaking out the first 8 games , along with two looks at the short - and long - term positive streaks the team has been on , and the season totals :
Record Goals For Goals Against Exp. Points Actual Points Diff Opening 8 games 2-5-1 11 25 2.3 ( .141 ) 4 +1.7 Last 26 19-5 - 2 85 68 32.3 ( .620 ) 37 +4.7 Last 7 6-0-1 32 21 10.0 ( .716 ) 12 +2.0 Total to date
22 -11-3 102 100 36.8 ( .511 ) 43 +6.2
Again , remember that the " Actual Points " may be a few points short of what you 'd expect from the record , due to the exclusion of shootout winners in the Pythagenpuck analysis .
Basically , although the Preds have won a few more points than one would expect based on Goals For and Against all along the way , their play since the opening weeks of the season has been truly excellent ; using GF / GA from the 26 - game stretch ( 85 - 68 ) across all 82 , along with a few shootout wins , would yield something around a 105 point season , just a hair ahead of what Chicago earned for 4th place in the Western Conference last spring .
In other words , with a relatively healthy lineup and decent , but not spectacular goaltending , the Predators have played like a strong playoff contender , not just a hopeful .
And while there are legitimate questions about how well they can keep up the scoring pace , there is also upside on the defensive side of the puck .
Pekka Rinne ( .905 ) and Dan Ellis ( .910 ) can both do better in terms of save percentage ; even a modest improvement there would balance out any expected decline in goal - scoring from the forwards .
In NASCAR , they like to use the phrase " drive it like you stole it . "
For the Predators , those extra points in the standings are like stolen goods that are now stocked away safely ; if they can keep up the Goals For & Against performance like they have over the last two months , those early gains could make enough of a difference to earn them home - ice advantage during the playoffs .
FREDERICK , Colo .
—A Colorado mom with a nose for trouble marched her son into the principal ’s office and said he was planning to set off a stink bomb at the school .
Frederick High School was briefly evacuated on Thursday after the woman reported the alleged plot .
There were no reports of any would - be bombs going off .
Police Chief Gary Barber says officers found a bag the boy had left near the school containing such ingredients as baking soda , flour , sugar and salt .
Barber says the concoction would have to be set on fire to produce fumes , and it was n’t clear if they ’d be noxious .
It ’s not certain what kind of punishment the boy might face .
No names were released .
Frederick is a town of 8,200 about 25 miles north of Denver .

In the book Strong Women , Deep Closets : Lesbians and Homophobia in Sports , Pat Griffin discusses the pressure on female athletes to constantly prove they , and their sport , are acceptably feminine , for fear of being labeled lesbians .
Women who engaged in , and openly enjoyed , sports have often been viewed with suspicion or concern , ranging from beliefs that physical exertion might make them infertile to a fear that women ’s sports teams serve as recruiting sites for lesbians .
Some college coaches even try to get young women to play on their teams by hinting to their parents that other schools their daughter is considering are known for having a lot of lesbians and it might not be the “ type of environment ” where they want their sweet little girl to go .
Female athletes , and women ’s sports teams , thus often feel a lot of pressure to prove their heterosexuality to quell homophobic fears and to make women ’s sports appealing to a broad audience .
One way to do so is to dissociate themselves from lesbians .
Another is to emphasize the femininity of female athletes , signaling that they are , despite their athletic abilities , still physically attractive to , and interested in , men .
Texas A& M put out this promotional media guide , which features an image of the male coach surrounded by the team in sexy clothing :
While these types of materials have traditionally been for the media , they ’re increasingly used as recruiting tools for players as well .
Those who produce them argue that they ’re just trying to put out something distinctive that will set them apart .
And as Jayda Evans at the Seattle Times says , it ’s not like men ’s sports teams are never photographed off the court .
But as many researchers have pointed out , and as Evans herself discusses , female athletes are often photographed and discussed in ways that largely erase their athletic abilities .
When men ’s teams are dressed up for publicity materials , it ’s usually for one or two images that are outnumbered by ones that highlight their sports participation .
For female athletes , images that exclude any connection to sports often become nearly the entire story .
And despite the fact that the creators often stress their interest in doing something unique and distinctive to set themselves apart , there is a very common set of elements in promotional materials for women ’s sports : clothing , make - up , hair , and poses that sexualize the players and implicitly include a reassurance to parents , potential players , and fans that the women are pretty , charming , and feminine , regardless of what they do on the court or the field .
That is , they are blending masculinity and femininity by being athletic and pretty , not giving up their femininity altogether .
Of course , part of an acceptable performance of femininity is showing that you want male attention , and that you actively try to make yourself appealing to men .
So while these materials might do many other things , they also carry a particular message : these girls like to pretty themselves up , and that should reassure you that it ’s not a team full of lesbians .
The effect of all this is that female athletes may feel pressured to keep their hair long , wear make - up even on the court , and emphasize any relationships they have with men or children to “ prove ” they are straight , and a lesbian who likes makeup and sexy clothing may face less suspicion and stigma than a straight woman who does n’t .
Also see our posts on Serena Williams ’s ESPN cover , Candace Parker “ is pretty , which helps , ” groundbreaking female sailor is also pretty , sexualizing female Olympic athletes , diets of champions , media portrayals of female athletes , and valuing dads in the WNBA .

According to a graduate student ’s research into the spying policies of major U.S. telecommunications companies , at a recent security conference a Sprint surveillance manager told a group of onlookers that half of all police requests include the target ’s text messages .
Half of millions — including some 8 million automated , web - based requests for GPS location , all in just over a year ’s time .
ADVERTISEMENT
The revelation was made by Indiana University grad Christopher Soghoian , as part of his PhD dissertation published Dec. 1 , 2009 .
He attributes the stunning number to Paul Taylor , an Electronic Surveillance Manager with Sprint Nextel , who was speaking recently at the Washington , D.C. International Securities Systems conference , otherwise known as ISS World .
“ Looking around at the name badges pinned to the suits milling around the refreshment area , it really was a who ’s who of the spies and those who enable their spying , ” he wrote .
“ Household name telecom companies and equipment vendors , US government agencies ( both law enforcement and intel ) .
Also present were representatives from foreign governments — Columbia , Mexico , Algeria , and Nigeria , who , like many of the US government employees , spent quite a bit of time at the vendor booths , picking up free pens and coffee mugs while they learned about the latest and greatest surveillance products currently on the market . ”
According to Soghoian , it was during the telecom service providers roundtable discussion that Taylor dropped the bombs .
“ [ M ]y major concern is the volume of requests .
We have a lot of things that are automated but that ’s just scratching the surface , ” he said in an audio recording that has since been removed due to alleged copyright violation .
“ One of the things , like with our GPS tool .
We turned it on the web interface for law enforcement about one year ago last month , and we just passed 8 million requests .
So there is no way on earth my team could have handled 8 million requests from law enforcement , just for GPS alone .
So the tool has just really caught on fire with law enforcement . ”

“ He ’s talking about the wonderful automated backend Sprint runs for law enforcement , LSite , which allows investigators to rapidly retrieve information directly , without the burden of having to get a human being to respond to every specific request for data , ” added Julian Sanchez at the Cato Institute .
“ Rather , says Sprint , each of those 8 million requests represents a time when an FBI computer or agent pulled up a target ’s location data using their portal or API .
( I do n’t think you can Tweet subpoenas yet . )
For an investigation whose targets are under ongoing realtime surveillance over a period of weeks or months , that could very well add up to hundreds or thousands of requests for a few individuals .
So those 8 million data requests , according to a Sprint representative in the comments , actually ‘ only ’ represent ‘ several thousand ’ discrete cases . ”
Taylor continued : “ Two or three years ago , we probably had less than 10 % of our requests including text messaging .
Now , over half of all of our surveillance includes SMS messaging . ”
He added that his team , which handles all of Sprint ’s police requests , is 110 people strong .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s useful to keep in mind that , as Sprint spokesman Matt Sullivan [ said ] , ‘every wireless carrier has a team and a system ’ through which police can access GPS data , ” noted a follow - up report by Talking Points Memo .
“ Sprint is the company unlucky enough to find itself the focus of scrutiny , but it reportedly controls just 18 % of the U.S. wireless market , making it the third largest carrier . ”
GPS location “ likely outnumber [s ] all other forms of surveillance request , ” Soghoian added .

Sprint has over 47 million customers in the U.S .
We 'd heard last month that this month was the month that Google would finally launch its highly - anticipated Chrome OS , and now we 've got a " reliable source " over at TechCrunch asserting that the software is gearing up for launch " within a week . "
Granted , we can't ever be too certain when it comes to a rumor such as this , but if the system really does hit the wilds , we probably wo n't see it available for every machine on the face of the planet .
The presumed Alpha build will likely only support a select few products that Google engineers have had a chance to specifically work with -- possibly something such as an Eee PC netbook , which has generally the same specifications regardless of design or model number .
Either way , we'd go ahead and prepare ourselves for something new before the end of November -- but do n't let it spoil your holidays should things get pushed back a bit , okay ?
As more than 200 Saline school districtÂ parents , staff members and students streamed into Liberty School tonight to talk about the district ’s financial state , they quickly grabbed all the available copies of the night ’s PowerPoint presentation .
Superintendent Scot GradenÂ told those without copies the numbers would be on the screen behind him .
And if they had trouble seeing it ?
“ I can assure you the numbers are n’t pretty , ” he said .
“ You might not want to get too close . ”
The next couple hours proved Graden right .
Saline Superintendent Scot Graden
The budget numbers Saline is facing paint a stark picture .
On a $ 52.4 million budget , the district - thanks to funding cuts from the state , enrollment losses and other factors - is anticipating a $ 5,465,000 budget shortfall over the next 18 months .
The shortfall is equivalent to the district completly closing its middle school , laying off all the middle school staff and not educating the middle school students , Graden told the audience .
The district is working to avoid that , but cuts are almost certain .
If teachers are laid off , the earliest staff would leave at the beginning of March , thanks to contract rules , Graden said .
Graden spent several hours tonight wading through financial numbers , pausing often to take questions from the audience .
They wanted to know about issues such as step increases for teachers , transportation costs , increasing pay - for - play fees and even schools of choice .
Parent Marcie Williams , who has two children in the district , said she hopes everything is on the table .
" I think ( the district administrators and school board ) need to look at every line item and see if it is helping students learn , " she said .
" If not , then they should cut it . "
District administrators will meet at the end of the month to determine any non -staff saving measures .
In late January , Graden plans to bring any possible mid-year staff reductionsÂ to the school board .
Saline , like all other districts across the state , has taken a $ 292 cut in per-pupil funding in the last several weeks from the state .
Â
Projections have those cuts continuing and growing into next year .
Also , earlier this month , voters turned down a countywide schools enhancement millage that would have raised $ 30 million a year for five years to be divided between Washtenaw County ’s 10 traditional school districts .

Trailer for Hot Tub Time Machine .
Hot Tub Time Machine follows a group of best friends who 've become bored with their adult lives : Adam ( John Cusack ) has been dumped by his girlfriend ; Lou ( Rob Corddry ) is a party guy who can't find the party ; Nick 's ( Craig Robinson ) wife controls his every move ; and video game - obsessed Jacob ( Clark Duke ) wo n't leave his basement .
After a crazy night of drinking in a ski resort hot tub , the men wake up , heads ' pounding , in the year 1986 .
This is their chance to kick some past and change their futures – one will find a new love life , one will learn to stand up for himself with the ladies , one will find his mojo , and one will make sure he still exists !
John Cusack has said in interviews that he decided to join the cast almost entirely just because of the title , Hot Tub Time Machine .
After the guys are transported back to the 80s , a series of images and videos are seen on a television that keys the group into the fact that they ’ve been transported back in time .
One of those images is a shot of Chevy Chase in the music video for Paul Simon ’s “ You Can Call Me Al ” .
Chase also appears in the film as the repairman who makes the time travel possibly .
While the guys are on the mountain , a man skis past talking on an 80s era cell phone .
The man asks whoever ’s on the other end , “ Where ’s my $ 2 ? ” , a reference to the 1985 movie Better Off Dead , also starring John Cusack .
The title alone is a certain kind of genius .
Hot Tub Time Machine .
It ’s such a simple title , but it tells you everything you need to know about the movie .
There is a hot tub and it is apparently a time machine .
Hijinks ensue .
The trailer sets up the trip as some middle aged friends trying to regain a shred of their youth , trying to relive old times .
Then the hot tub time machine messes it all up by actually sending them back to relive old times .
Duke looks to play a kid of one of the group , making him even more out of place in the past and possibly threatening his very existence !
The Hot Tub Time Machine trailer really lets John Cusack , Rob Corddry , Craig Robinson , and Clark Duke show off their comedy chops .
Each and everyone one of them is capable of delivering great one liners and improving hilarious lines , a couple of which no doubt made it into this trailer .
Particularly funny are Robinson ’s lines of “ What color is Michael Jackson , ” as a way to see which decade they ’re in , and his deadpan , “ It must be some kind of hot tub time machine ” as he looks right at the camera .
Hot Tub Time Machine has real potential .
Will it receive a bunch of prestigious awards ?
Almost certainly not .
Will it be a fun movie that will get some good laughs ?
Almost definitely .
Close followers of the Climategate controversy know that much of the mêlée surrounds an e-mail in which Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) chief Phil Jones wrote about using “ Mike ’s Nature Trick ” ( MNT ) to “ hide the decline . ”
And yet , seventeen days and thousands of almost exclusively on - line op - eds into this scandal , it still seems that very few understand exactly which “ decline ” was being hidden , what “ trick ” was used to do so , and why Jones ’s words have become the slogan for the greatest scientific fraud in history .
As the mainstream media move from abject denial to dismissive whitewashing , CRU co-conspirators move to Copenhagen for tomorrow ’s U.N. climate meeting , intent on changing the world as we know it based primarily on their now - exposed trickery .
Add yesterday ’s announcement of a U.N. investigation into the matter , which will doubtless be no less corrupt than those being investigated , and public awareness of how and why that trick was performed is now more vital than ever .
So please allow me to explain in what I hope are easily digestible terms .
First and foremost -- contrary to what you ’ve likely read elsewhere in the blogosphere or heard from the few policymakers and pundits actually addressing the issue , it was not the temperature decline the planet has been experiencing since 1998 that Jones and friends conspired to hide .
Certainly , the simple fact that the e-mail was sent in November of 1999 should allay any such confusion .
In fact , the decline Jones so urgently sought to hide was not one of measured temperatures at all , but rather figures infinitely more important to climate alarmists -- those determined by proxy reconstructions .
As this scandal has attracted new readers to the subject , I ask climate - savvy readers to indulge me while I briefly explain climate proxies , as they are an essential ingredient of this contemptible conspiracy .
Truth be told , even reasonably reliable instrumental readings are a relatively modern convenience , limiting CRU ’s global measured temperature database to a start date somewhere in the mid-19th century .
That ’s why global temperature charts based on actual readings typically use a base year of 1850 , or somewhere thereabout .
And yet , most historical temperature charts , including the one Al Gore preached before in An Inconvenient Truth , go way back to 1000 AD .
That ’s where proxies come in .
While historical documents ( e.g. , ship ’s logs , diaries , court and church records , tax rolls , and even classic literature ) certainly provide a glimpse into past temperature trends , such information is far too limited and generalized to be of any statistical value .
So climate scientists have devised means to measure variations in such ubiquitous materials as lake sediments , boreholes , ice cores , and tree rings to evaluate past temperature trends .
They then employ complex computer programs to combine such “ proxy ” data sampled throughout a region and plot that area ’s annual relative changes in temperature hundreds or even thousands of years prior .
By then combining the data sets , they believe they can accurately reproduce hemispheric and global temperature trends of the previous millennia .
And while reconstructions -- as past temperature interpretations from proxy data are called -- can differ greatly from one source to another , those generated by the CRU have often been accepted as the de facto temperatures of the past .
This is largely because the U.N. ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) proclaims them to be .
Warmist Public Enemy Number One : The Medieval Warming Period
It ’s important to understand that early analyses , and even many contemporary studies , of these “ proxies ” clearly demonstrate that three radical temperature shifts occurred within the past millennium .
Indeed , the years 900 - 1300 AD were labeled the Medieval Warming Period ( MWP ) , as global temperatures rose precipitously from the bitter cold of the previous Dark Ages to levels several degrees warmer than today .
The Little Ice Age , a sudden period of cooling , then followed and lasted until the year 1850 .
And then began the modern warming period , which is by no means unique and appears to have ended with the millennium itself .
Originally , even the IPCC accepted that pre-20th - century analysis .
In fact , the 1990 First Assessment Report used this schematic IPCC 1990 Figure 7c ( courtesy of Climate Audit ) to represent last millennium ’s dramatic temperature swings .
But this image of a fluid climate system subject to abrupt and natural up - and - downturns made " unprecedented " 20th - century warming about as marketable as Florida swampland .
And opportunists who depended on the aberrance of post - industrial revolution warming in order to condemn and control mankind ’s CO 2 emissions soon recognized that perhaps the LIA , and most certainly the MWP , simply had to go .
And as many of these hucksters were closely connected to the IPCC -- both sender and recipient names on those illuminating CRU emails include many of its editors , lead authors , and contributors -- that task was far less daunting than one might imagine .
Proxies , Tricks , and Hockey Sticks
The first step was taken in the 1995 Second Assessment Report , when the above Figure 7c was replaced with a 1993 reconstruction from R.S. Bradley and Phil Jones himself that used 1400 AD as its base -- effectively wiping the MWP off the radar screen .
But it was n’t until the 2001 Third Assessment Report ( TAR ) that the MWP simply vanished .
This multi-proxy reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies appeared in chapter 2 , page 134 of the Working Group 1 ( WG1 ) report [ PDF ] .
IPCC 2001 WG1 Fig 2.20
Of course , the first thing you ’ll notice is that both the MWP and LIA have indeed disappeared .
In fact , temperatures appear to trend downward throughout the millennium until a sharp jump upward last century .
But if you look closer , you ’ll also notice that the “ reconstructed ” series terminates in 1980 .
What forms the dramatic blade to the hockey stick shape ( yes , this is indeed the famous “ Hockey - Stick ” graph ) is instead the distal segment of the 1902 - to - 1999 instrumental data series .
Mann has recently claimed that the available proxy data ended in 1980 , but even his co-conspirators at RealClimate admit that ’s nonsense .
The truth is that the proxy data was scrapped because unlike those measured , reconstructed temperatures showed a marked decline after 1980 .
And as the chart plotted temperature anomalies against what the plotters selected as the “ normal ” period and temperatures of 1961 to 1990 , the reconstruction would have been quite unremarkable otherwise .
So at the 1980 mark , the actual post - 1980 measurements were attached to the truncated proxy series to create the illusion that they were one .
The figure below , found on the same page of the WG1 report , reveals this trick more clearly .
This chart plots the original four reconstructions used : two from Mann et al , one from Jones et al , and one from Briffa et al .
Notice how all but the first series continue to trend downward around 1960 while instrumental readings begin to trend upward ?
And even that series ends abruptly in 1980 .
IPCC 2001 WG1 Fig 2.21
So not only did conspirators cherry - pick the one series of the four that approximated measured temperatures the longest , they also terminated that series at the point that it too , began to trend down .
They then joined it to the actual 1980 - 1999 temperatures to “ hide the decline ” in the final product , as that decline created an inexplicable divergence between the reconstructed and measured temperatures .. the existence of which challenges the entire series dating back to 1000 AD .
Remember , all the temperatures prior to 1850 were estimated by computer algorithms , and no actual readings exist to prove or disprove those figures .
So a relatively short window of opportunity exists to test the programs against observations .
Had 20 th - century measured temperatures continued to align with those recreated as smoothly after 1960 as they did previously , then the programmers could declare their code and hence their millennial temperatures sound .
But the divergence , if allowed to stand , instead reveals serious design flaws in the proxy reconstructions ... which suggests that just as the decline was dealt with through trickery , so was the MWP .
And it seems that each time the trick was used , its involvement would be more deeply concealed .
Every multi-volume IPCC Assessment has been accompanied by a relatively brief and highly - politicized Summary for Policymakers ( SPM ) .
This synopsis invariably commands the bulk of the media and political attention .
Here ’s the version of the graph depicted prominently on page 3 of the 2001 TAR SPM [ PDF ] , the only version of the report most policymakers and reporters would ever actually see .
Notice how they further obscured their chicanery by omitting the series - defining legend and the “ 1988 instrumental value ” declaration :
IPCC 2001 SPM Fig 1 b
And despite the fact that the only confirmable segment of the series failed that very test , which should have declared the entire series null and void , the chart ’s caption informed policymakers that
the rate and duration of warming of the 20th century has been much greater than in any of the previous nine centuries .
Similarly , it is likely that the 1990s have been the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year of the millennium .
And it ’s this highly fraudulent version that has become the poster child of the equally fraudulent Anthropogenic Global Warming ( AGW ) movement .
All this is thanks in large part to the trick that hides the decline .
Trick or Cheat
Now we 'll take a closer look at exactly what Jones meant when he wrote that he had “ just completed Mike ’s Nature Trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( i.e. , from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline . ”
Why did Jones refer to the ruse as “ Mike ’s Nature Trick
”
?
As die - hard Hockey Team opponents and fans alike already know , the original 600 - year version of the now infamous “ Hockey - Stick ” graph was dubbed MBH98 because it first appeared in the Michael Mann , Raymond Bradley , and Malcolm Hughes paper “ Global - Scale Temperature Patterns and Climate Forcing Over the Past Six Centuries ” [ PDF ] , originally published in the science journal Nature in 1998 .
And “ Mike ’s Nature Trick ” received its dubious designation among CRU insiders for the very same reason .
As to the rest of the sentence , it seems Jones was working on a cover chart for a forthcoming World Meteorological Organization report [ PDF ] , “ WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 1990 , ” when he wrote the e-mail .
As the graph would incorporate one reconstruction of his own plus one each from Michael Mann and Keith Briffa , Jones was informing them that he had used the trick on Mann ’s series at the same 1980 cutoff as MBH98 , but found it necessary to use 1960 as the cutoff on the Briffa series .
And what I uncovered in the source code told why .
While Mann used multiple proxy sources , Briffa ’s reconstructions were based solely on a property of annual tree ring growth known as maximum latewood density ( MXD ) .
And the MXD - only - driven plots began to diverge from actual temperatures as early as 1960 .
In fact , while many of CRU ’s programs are designed to exclude all data after 1960 for later manual splicing with instrumental data , others employ “ fudge factors ” to force the generated plot to more closely adhere to measured temperatures as far back as 1930 .
And as you ’ll soon see , Jones ’s admitted use of MNT took it to an entirely new level of fraud .
Here ’s the original reconstruction , with the three proxy and measured temperature ( black ) series intact :
Notice how Briffa ’s series ( green ) begins to trend sharply downward around the mid-20 th century .
Jones ’s series ( red ) soon follows , but less sharply , and then it begins to trend higher .
Mann ’s ( blue ) appears to flatten out around the same year that Jones ’s begins to fall .
Meanwhile , all three have broken with the measured rising temperatures of the late 20 th century .
Now take a look at the chart actually published by the WMO , with all three proxy series having been surreptitiously subjected to MNT :
Since the release of CRU ’s FOI2009 , alarmists have continued their claim that there ’s nothing deceptive about the “ trick ” and that it has been openly discussed in scientific journals like Nature since 1998 .
But I defy anyone to compare the above chart -- the one to which Jones wrote he had applied MNT -- to the unadulterated version above it and tell me there ’s been no deception committed .
At least with MBH98 , a sharp eye might recognize the ruse .
Here , there is no indication given whatsoever that the graph represents an amalgam of proxy and measured temperatures .
This , my friends , is fraud .
And I hope that those investigating the fraud will carefully consider this explanation of the WMO cheating given last week by Jones :
One of the three temperature reconstructions was based entirely on a particular set of tree - ring data that shows a strong correlation with temperature from the 19th century through to the mid-20 th century , but does not show a realistic trend of temperature after 1960 .
This is well known and is called the ‘ decline ’ or ‘ divergence ’ .
The use of the term ‘ hiding the decline ’ was in an email written in haste .
CRU has not sought to hide the decline .
Indeed , CRU has published a number of articles that both illustrate , and discuss the implications of , this recent tree - ring decline , including the article that is listed in the legend of the WMO Statement figure .
It is because of this trend in these tree - ring data that we know does not represent temperature change that I only show this series up to 1960 in the WMO Statement .
[ My emphasis . ]
And they ’ll immediately recognize the dishonest denial they ’re dealing with when they read the WMO Statement figure from the inside cover Jones referred to :
Northern Hemisphere temperatures were reconstructed for the past 1000 years ( up to 1999 ) using palaeoclimatic records ( tree rings , corals , ice cores , lake sediments , etc. ) , along with historical and long instrumental records .
The data are shown as 50 - year smoothed differences from teh 1961 - 1990 normal .
Uncertainties are greater in the early part of the millennium ( see page 4 for further information ) .
For more details , readers are referred to the PAGES newsletter ( Vol. 7 , No .
1 : March 1999 , also available at http://www.pages.unibe.ch) and the National Geophysical Data Center ( http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov).
Even if MNT had been explained as Jones claimed -- which it had n’t -- just how was the observer expected to differentiate the reconstructed from the actual data ?
And good luck finding that newsletter .
Spin it any way you want -- Mike ’s Nature Trick is Phil ’s WMO cheat .
More Tricks of the Charade
While suddenly the most famous , Mike ’s is not the only trick in CRU ’s bag .
Many of the programs I reviewed contained routines to exclude proxy data that demonstrated poor correlations with local temperature , which of course explains why CRU ’s 19th - through mid-20th - century proxy temperatures appeared to be observationally accurate .
Others “ estimated ” values for missing data .
And then there ’s the Yamal matter -- also a popular subject of the CRU e-mails .
In an October 5th e-mail to climatologist Tom Wigley , Jones took issue with a piece I had written that day exposing the lies in CRU - based U.N. climate reports , which included a section on Keith Briffa ’s mistreatment of Polar Ural data in order to exaggerate 20th - century warming .
That e-mail prompted the reply from Wigley -- now familiar to AT readers -- in which he admitted it was “ distressing to read that American Stinker item ” -- before offering to help Briffa , who “ does seem to have got himself into a mess , ” write an “ explanation ” for his deceitful cherry - picking of Yamal peninsula data .
Indeed , Keith ’s Yamal Trick also “ fudged ” proxy reconstructions , not by overwriting them with instrumental data à la Mike , but rather by underhandedly stacking the actual data set with trees handpicked to assure his predetermined outcome .
Yet both methods intentionally corrupted reconstruction results for the same devious purpose -- to skew late - 20th - century temperatures higher in order to artificially create the dreaded hockey - stick effect .
Now , you might be wondering why all this fuss is being made over late - 20th - century temperatures when even we realists accept that they did rise until 1998 .
Hopefully , you now understand why the divergence between proxy and measured temperatures betrays a potential serious flaw in the process by which temperatures are reconstructed from tree - ring density .
And any reconstruction demonstrating such a flaw - revealing divergence should be dismissed outright , not presented as policy fodder .
But there ’s another issue at stake here .
Anthony Watts has surveyed over 75 % of the 1,200 - plus U.S. weather stations from which national temperatures are accumulated .
Most of those were found to be inaccurate by more than 2 °C , largely due to being located within ten meters of an artificial heating source .
In fact , less than 10 % met strict placement guidelines set forth by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Not to worry -- NOAA claims it has methods to “ adjust ” for such bias , including the use of “ smoothing ” adjustments to “ homogenize ” station data to that of surrounding stations .
Unpublished computer programs artificially adjusting the data -- what could possibly go wrong with that ?
Would you be shocked to learn that at ICCC 3 , Watts told us he had calculated such adjustments to raw temperature data between 1940 and 1999 to be 0.5 °F to the positive ?
That accounts for almost one half of the 1.2 °F warming over the last century .
And that ’s here in America .
Try to imagine what kind of shenanigans might be going on elsewhere in the world .
Consequently , even the “ instrumental ” temperatures the CRU crooks were using as a basis for fudging were likely themselves fudged .
So they were pumping the incline while hiding the decline .
Hold the Fudge , and the MWP Wo n’t Budge
In a June 2003 e-mail to Jones and company , Mann discussed the notion of expanding CRU charts to two millennia in an effort to “ try to " contain " the putative " MWP . " ” No deception in that , I suppose .
Of course , an honest 2000 - year reconstruction , such as this one from CO2Science.org , adapted from a 2005 Moberg , et al temperature history derived from tree - rings and lake and ocean sediments , would actually emphasize rather than “ contain ” the MWP :
Any questions why Mann and friends work so diligently to “ contain ” ( hide ) the MWP ?
As you can see , the post - LIA warming that began around 1850 is neither unprecedented nor spectacular .
And it 's certainly not worth rewiring the economic circuitry of the planet over .
And the CRU / IPCC reconstructions have been counterfeited for the express purpose of hiding that very fact .
After all , the stakes are enormous : perhaps trillions of dollars and unquestionably every American ’s personal liberties .
Tomorrow , over 20,000 delegates from 193 nations will gather in Copenhagen to craft an agreement which would not only force American power consumption to levels equal to those of about 1910 , but would also have us pay reparations for an imaginary “ climate debt ” we ’ve accumulated by building the world ’s greatest economy of all time .
That debt is based on the amount of CO 2 our financial growth has purportedly pumped into the atmosphere , which , according to the conclusions of the IPCC and based largely upon reports from the CRU , has selfishly imperiled the planet by inducing climate change .
Of course , asking Americans to pay reparations based on the claim they ’ve done harm to other nations by spoiling the climate is like asking me to pay damages to my neighbor based on his claim that he can’t sell his house because my great - grandmother ’s ghost is haunting it .
As many have known and as Climategate has proven , both situations are equally preposterous .
Second visit to the Second City ( come on , where else is ?
Manchester ?
Birmingham ? ) .
Well , strictly speaking , third , but the first time was when my eye was untrained , and was spent mainly watching friends get stoned while watching Curb Your Enthusiasm , so does n't count .
I was there to give a lecture , but used the opportunity to do some extensive flaneuring and to try out my new camera - hence , you will find a drastic decline in quality here from the usual .
The walk progressed from the genteel Hillhead through Partick to Anderston , then through the centre of town to Glasgow Cross and Glasgow Green .
I do n't have a Pevsner for Glasgow so am unable to identify lots of these - any information is , as ever , greatly appreciated .
Glasgow is perhaps the only city in Britain where I could unambiguously and definitively say that the Victorian architecture really is better than that of the 1940s - 70s .
Not so much because of the crapness of latter , but because the determinedly urban , powerful , dramatic nature of the former is extremely hard to surpass .
However , given that as far as I can tell the largest concentration of old tenements is in the West End , it 's hard to guess just how bad their proletarian equivalents were .
Almost all accounts I 've come across argue that they were very bad indeed , worse presumably than the straggling wastescape of the contemporary East End .
The West End tenements below , though , are truly lovely .
My modernist get - out clause here is that their order , repetition , lack of extraneous tat , and their unashamed modernity , exempts tenement fetishism from the peasant associations of the hooray - for - back - to - backs - and - gardens tendency in England .
New tenements seem as unconvincing as new terraces though , as we will see .
There are a few bits of modern infill which largely just seem inept - importations from Manchester or Leeds , little yuppiedromes using , as is customary , five or six cladding materials at once , and far further than the 60s blocks from the consistency and focus of 19th century Glaswegian architecture , standing almost entirely blind to their surroundings , while at the same time scrupulously respecting the height limits set by heritage ideology .
Hence , they manage to be both petty and bluff .
Impressively .
The first of these is about as good as it gets - it at least makes a bit of an effort , the other none whatsoever .
On the way to the city centre , one passes various institutional buildings - those of the University , which has a couple of fine Brutalist compositions - but also the Western Infirmary , whose long block on stilts is bracingly warlike , and its concrete looks clean and shiny in the cold sunshine .
Nearby , however , overshadowing it , are the red sandstone explosions of Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Kelvin Hall .
Kelvin
Hall is the first example on this walk of a building type which seems peculiar to Glasgow , and which will run throughout this post - the near - skyscraper , the building which wants to be a skyscraper or , in this case , appears as the lost , truncated top of a skyscraper , with its preceding 20 storeys chopped off .
The manner in which it dramatically forces itself upwards , its lack of tastefulness and the air of melodrama make it undeniably Americanist , the assemblage of obelisks and globes on the tower nearer to Raymond Hood or Eliel Saarinen than Edwin Lutyens .
At Anderston the contradictions of Glasgow architecture are especially vivid .
There are a series of interlinked blocks of flats , and the contrast with the tenements is horribly unfair .
The windows are absolutely tiny , as against the generous height of the tenement ceilings , and the chromatic complexities of the red and blond stone are near to the cheapest plattenbau concrete panels .
The walkways attempt to add some futurist appeal to it all , but even they look poky .
The overwhelming impression is grim , but to be frank , not uninterestingly so – the bracing Siberian air gives a Low - esque patina of tragic , imposing grimness .
A ' ladies ' hair and beauty salon ' called Intrigue certainly helps this impression along .
Across the road , postmodernist tenements seem to have ceilings as low as the modernist barracks they face .
Still , at least they do n't declare their distrust of their inhabitants as loudly as the ubiquitous CCTV does .
Then there 's a massive rupture , where the ordered , only intermittently interrupted city is torn apart , in favour of the motorway landscape where the M8 meets the Kingston Bridge .
Wrongheaded as all this is , the first feeling on crossing it is awe , as you attempt to trace all the different directions that the traffic is going in , vertiginously aware of how puny , how easily killed you are , and how terrifyingly close you can get to these channels of motorised death .
The bridge across is extremely icy , which does not help .
On the other side are blocks showing another Americanism , the weirdly Mid-Western style of Glasgow 's commercial postmodernism .
Inside this area is a completely self - enclosed alien landscape , in amazingly close proximity to a preserved Victoriana .
Then we get to the Grid , and the blocks that make up commercial central Glasgow , where the one - time vigour and independence of the city 's ruling class is still palpable .
Another version of Glasgow Americanism is that of Miami rather than Mid-West : ' The Beresford ' , a 1938 building which has variously been offices for ICI , a Halls of Residence , and is currently - obviously - luxury flats .
Again , it appears to have weirdly little to do with Glasgow , or with the independent line of proto - skyscrapers that it developed at the turn of the century ( more of which in a moment ) .
Nonetheless , the way it has accommodated so many different functions at least partly qualifies it as an example of Manhattanism as defined by Koolhaas .
Like many of the tallest pre-war buildings in Glasgow it 's at the bottom of a hill , as if they did n't actually want to create a skyline .
The central grid means that Manhattanism makes more sense here than anywhere else in the UK , and the city 's architects clearly knew it during the period where this was – after London , New York and Berlin – the fourth largest city in the world .
Today , the only attempts in the grid to skyscrape are a tallish recent hotel by GM&AD and a decent post - war curtain wall by George Square .
The pictures below , though , are all examples of the ( if you will ) halfscrapers of 1880s - 1930s Glasgow , and the internet is quiet on who the architects might be .
A variety of styles are employed – Flemish Gothic , Beaux - Arts , etc – although you can often discern the metal frames that lie beneath , and the distant inspiration of the likes of Daniel Burnham or Louis Sullivan .
None of them ever manage to leap out of the grid , but you can tell they want to , that they 're just itching to transcend their 9 or 10 storeys up to 20 or 30 .
James Salmon designed the two Glasgow office blocks which seem most keen to make this leap .
Salmon 's buildings are as sachlich in their technical display as anything by the Chicago School , who were themselves inspired by Glasgow architects like Alexander Thomson ( they certainly held the latter in higher regard than Glasgow Council seems to , given that his astonishing churches in the Gorbals and St Vincent Street feel decidedly lost ) .
Salmon 's hard to photograph 1899 ' Hat - Rack ' building uses large expanses of glass , its gaunt symmetry veritably pricking upwards , its bays seeming to predict Auguste Perret .
Even more interesting is Lion Chambers , one of the strangest buildings I 've ever come across .
Constructed using the then cutting - edge Hennebique Concrete system , it was so experimental that it 's apparently almost impossible to restore .
It is currently held up with string so that it wo n't completely fall apart , but is derelict and noticeably crumbling .
A combined office block and chambers for solicitors , it includes some very dubious looking concrete judges on the façade .
The block seems to mash several different buildings together , with one part seeming like a glass and concrete Chicago skyscraper , another side all Scottish baronial , with the front a bizarre composite .
This freakishly original building was surely the potential point of take - off for the Scottish skyscraper that never occurred .
One of the tall office blocks of Victorian Glasgow is Charles Rennie Mackintosh 's offices for the Glasgow Herald , a craggy , cranky thing which barges into a small side street .
Famously , Glasgow 's visitors are enthralled by the variety of available ' Mockintosh ' .
I pop along to one of the Glasgow School of Art 's tours of the building , which is given by an amiable former textile student who clearly knows next - to - nothing about architecture , but is keen to tell us it's all about nature , symbolism and stuff .
The dizzying library , with its lighting effects borrowed from – oh yes – American skyscrapers , is worth the asking price , but is given about as much attention as the question of how annoying it apparently was to have been educated in the ' concrete monstrosity ' opposite .
They really ought to employ some of the architectural enthusiasts in the city who are now likely to be jobless .
The Lighthouse , the architecture centre that attaches itself to the Glasgow Herald building , recently went into administration .
Its small exhibition on Mackintosh provides far more insight into his work than the tour you pay a tenner for at GSA .
A city whose architectural inequalities are as gross as Glasgow 's should not be even thinking about closing a facility for architectural education , but as it is you can go to the viewing platform at the top and see it completely empty , as the strange and complex skyline is presumably less interesting than pondering what the ogee windows of GSA were ' about ' .
One of the exhibitions at the Lighthouse is on ' labour ' - more specifically , a set of proposals to reindustrialise this once overwhelmingly productivist city .
I do n't think one falls into Spiked Online - style Neo-entrepeneurialism in thinking this a marvellous idea , abandoning the pernicious tyranny of the servile service industry and the patronising tourism represented by the Mockintosh , through creating jobs that might induce some degree of pride or purpose .
Sadly the actual images and proposals , ranging from the usual greenery to some melancholy images of abandoned mines , lack the libidinal force that could make this idea really convince .
At the top of Page & Park 's Lighthouse extension you can see , atop the hills that overlook the metropolis , a series of wind turbines , which make the same case more simply , with elegance and succinctness .
As things are , this is an idea very far from anyone 's agenda .
On the train , I spot graffiti alongside the vast , derelict steelworks which closed in 1993 .
An SNP logo , and the words ' SAVE RAVENSCRAIG , SAVE SCOTTISH STEEL ' .
The steel for BDP 's 2001 Glasgow Science Centre was made in Gdansk .
I wanted to see the People 's Palace , as a ferrovitreous tribute to Glasgow 's finest ( ahem ) ' deconstructionist ' , Entschwindet , but also to see the Glasgow tube .
Which is ... cute , the only architectural evidence that we are in the ( musical ) home of Twee , aside perhaps from the laughably provincial pomo buildings that house Mono , the Pastels ' vegan cafe and record shop ( and I suspect you can guess my opinion on the Pastels also ) .
So I took a roundabout route , which entailed amongst other things a wander round Laurieston , New Gorbals , where I saw Norfolk Court , the place above , which is the most striking thing on the way into Central Station .
It 's colossal , nearly as wide as it is high .
Like the similarly gigantic Whitevale / Bluevale blocks , Sighthill or Red Road , it 's hard to make a case for it on strictly architectural grounds - no clever detailing , no smart angles , no textured surfaces , no futuristic extrusions , just a gigantic slab ( two , specifically ) .
What it does is display power , and presence .
Here we are , if you do n't like it then fuck off .
It 's a tower about to fuckin ' chin ye .
It 's also , according to some accounts , popular with tenants , who are less than pleased about proposals for , alternately , demolition and clearance or recladding and transformation into yuppiedromes .
This riverside site is prime real estate , and is being left to rot until a suitable plan for cleansing is agreed .
From there , across the river , passing the arrant Mancunian tripe above , to Glasgow Cross and then to Glasgow Green , and to the sandstone baroque / ferrovitreous People 's Palace , next to the Doge 's Palace , or rather its transliteration into a redbrick carpet factory .
Before that , though , this - a piece of 1990s axial planning , where an arch from a completely different building was aligned perfectly with the stern Grecian temple opposite , though certainly not with the obelisk on the other side .
In the middle , if you click on the photo above , is a white - bearded gentleman wondering what on earth is going on here .
Elsewhere on the Green , a zoom lens can indicate surviving industry , sat next to the Last Year in Marienbad angular topiary .
On the other side is ' Homes for the Future ' , a peculiar scheme which I profiled for BD , and which is not entirely bad once its utterly non-Glasgow nature is assumed - the walkways of the part facing the green are particularly , well , interesting .
The People 's Palace features , among its interactive exhibits , the desk of John Maclean , Britain 's first Bolshevik Commissar , under some ' 80s neo -expressionist murals of insurgent Glasgow .
The items - pamphlets , papers , artfully scattered - on the desk are under glass .
In the Crystal Palace at the back , the huge airy space is filled with the sound of Cliff Richard 's ' Mistletoe and Wine ' .
Red Clydeside seems to have been quiet since the bizarre suicide of the Scottish Socialist Party , which rose and fell with equal abruptness .
A wander round the corner , to a Red Bookshop , where , as I stock up on Workerist literature , the elderly owner guesses my politics ( the badges are a bit of a giveaway - ' I used to make ones like that ' ) and engages me in conversation about the weather in a viscous - thick Glasgow accent .
' It 's started already ' , he says .
' It 's terrible .
And from here it 's only going to get worse and worse . '
Afterwards , I wonder if he was actually talking about the icy cold outside or actually meant , y'know , the weather .
The landscape around is a mess of waste , surface carparks and unambitious ' vernacular ' housing .
It sharpens itself up as you get to Glasgow Cross , and then to the ' Merchant City ' , an uneasy mix of yuppiedrome infill and more 1860s - 30s grandiosity .
Here , as elsewhere , you see a combined and uneven credit crunch , dereliction and shininess sitting next to each other , trying to pretend it is n't happening .
George Square is where the grid of central Glasgow opens out for brief breathing space , and is the last place in Britain to have been occupied by the army , unless you count the theory that the military were reinforcing the police in certain areas during the Miners ' Strike .
In early 1919 , the British government were absolutely convinced that this was to be the place where Bolshevism would erupt .
A pitched battle here between police and demonstrators led to reinforcement with tanks , and a brief military occupation of the entire city , with the Red Clydesiders taken by surprise , left wishing they 'd taken Maryhill Barracks in time .
It 's too cramped here now to imagine an insurrection beginning on this spot .
The lions and the stark , abstract cenotaph are one thing , but the light architecture that fills the square in the run-up to Christmas is something else entirely .
On the way up I saw countless freight trains packed with Chinese containers , which is as good an indicator of Christmas ' imminence than any advent calendar , as we stock up on tat from the places that still make stuff .
Looking at the seasonal George Square , you have to stare very hard to imagine it as the site of revolutionary action .
It 's hard , but not impossible .
You 'd just have to utilise the carousels and decorations in some strategic manner .

For years , I ’ve kept a store of rice , oats and canned goods , along with pickles , potatoes , shelled beans and frozen vegetables , in the cellar of our old farm house .
I buy food in bulk quantities and put up as much as I can from our garden .
Going to all this trouble in summer is like holding down an extra part - time job , but I do it because I like to have some idea of where my family ’s food comes from .
Recently , though , I began to have doubts about the bulk buying part of my hoarding strategy .
Three months ago , I ordered a 5 - pound bag of organic black beans from my local food - buying club .
When the bag arrived , I was dismayed to find that the source origination cited on the package from United Natural Foods Inc. was not California , or the Midwest .
Get all of VTDigger 's daily news .
You 'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox .
The country of origin was a place I tend to associate with melamine - laced baby formula : China .
Until that point , I had naively assumed that the bulk food I ordered through the club and purchased from my local co-op was grown domestically .
It turns out my assumption was wrong .
A surprising number of organic products available at co-ops and natural food stores in Vermont now come from China .
These are the Chinese organics I ’ve been able to identify : fresh garlic , pine nuts , pumpkin seeds , black beans , soybeans , adzuki beans and mung beans .
In addition , most natural foods stores and co-ops offer frozen foods from Woodstock Farms , a house brand owned by UNFI that distributes imported Chinese broccoli , asparagus , spinach , peas , mushrooms , edamame and peppers .
Some frozen foods from Cascadian farms , including the company ’s California mix ( cauliflower , broccoli and carrots ) , are also from China .
Since I bought that first bag of Chinese beans in September , I ’ve asked a lot of questions and been transferred from one communications officer to the next , put in voicemail hell and given punts like my personal favorite , “ Could you please put your questions in an e-mail ? ”
( So that we can ignore them forever . )
I wanted to know why co-ops do n’t post the country of origin on bulk foods ; what steps USDA officials have taken to regulate organic foods from China ; and why these products are n’t produced domestically .
Each of these lines of inquiry is taken up in a series of stories this week in Vtdigger.org , “ Your organic food : Now made in China . ”
For the most part , store managers were forthcoming , as were representatives from Eden Foods , which is privately owned , and Frontier , which is a cooperative owned by food co-ops around the country .
VTDigger is underwritten by :
I was stonewalled by the major corporations .
I made a dozen calls to UNFI , which is based in Providence , R.I. , and I was never able to reach a company official .
Nor did I get through to the Organic Trade Association or Hain - Celestial Inc. , one of the largest organic food manufacturers in the U.S .
In my long - running communications with the USDA National Organics Program , I was referred to the Web site repeatedly , and though I received verification of certain tips from sources , I did not get an interview with an official from the agency .
So why am I telling you all this ?
Why should you care about how difficult it has been to report this story ?
Because , dear reader , when government officials and businesses are this reluctant to provide information about basic quality controls for organic foods that are grown in China , one wonders what they do n’t want us to know .
I was n't as surprised as many others were , when it was revealed that climate - change " researchers " had discussed in private e-mails how to keep important data from public view lest it shake public belief in the dogma that human activities are contributing significantly to global warming .
I was n't particularly surprised because just a few weeks earlier I had spoken at the Oakland Rethinking AIDS Conference about the dogmatism and strong - arm tactics that are rampant in a seemingly increasing range of fields of medicine and science .
PowerPoint presentations of most of the talks at the Conference are available at the Conference website .
Here 's a slightly modified , more readable , text version of my own talk .
The theme in a nutshell :
For several centuries , modern science was pretty much a free intellectual market populated by independent entrepreneurs who shared the goal of understanding how the world works .
Nowadays it 's a corporate enterprise where patents , pay - offs , prestige , and power take priority over getting at the scientific truth , and the powers - that - be have established knowledge monopolies .
I had met Peter Duesberg in person only at the Conference , but I had been quite familiar with him from many videos .
What had always stuck in my mind was his expression of surprise , astonishment , sheer disbelief , as he told what happened to him after he questioned whether HIV could be the cause of AIDS :
I had all the students I wanted . . . lab space . . . grants . . . . elected to the National Academy . . . . became California Scientist of the Year .
All my papers were published .
I could do no wrong . . . professionally . . . until I started questioning . . . that HIV is the cause of AIDS .
Then everything changed .
What happened then was that he got no more grants ; his manuscripts were rejected without substantive critiques , just that " everyone knows that HIV causes AIDS " ; Robert Gallo , who earlier had talked of Duesberg 's distinction as a leading retrovirologist , now publicly called him dishonest on scientific matters .
Defenders of the mainstream view have even held Duesberg responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of South Africans and have described him as the moral equivalent of a Holocaust denier .
What had Duesberg done to bring about that radical change ?
Scientific Literacy an ... Henry H. Bauer Best Price : $ 4.25 Buy New $ 12.28 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
Absolutely nothing .
He was doing science just as before : gathering data , documenting his sources , making his analyses , presenting his conclusions for comment by others .
Of course Duesberg was surprised that suddenly he had gone from lauded leading scientist to discredited crackpot .
Of course Duesberg was surprised , because his experience of suddenly being sent beyond the pale was obviously an aberration .
Science is n't like this .
Science is done by the objective self - correcting scientific method .
Peer review is impersonal and impartial .
Arguments are substantive , not ad hominem .
This experience must be unprecedented , unique .
Or , perhaps , shared just by other AIDS Rethinkers , because questioning that HIV causes AIDS is just too outrageous , and quite justifiably it puts AIDS " denialists " outside the norms of scientific behavior and discourse .
You would n't find anything like this in other , more normal fields of medicine or science .
Well , actually , you would .
You do .
Duesberg and AIDS Rethinkers are not alone in this .
Duesberg 's experience is not unique , it 's even far from unique .
The Skeptical Environm ... Bjorn Lomborg Best Price : $ 2.51 Buy New $ 22.32 ( as of 05:15 EST - Details )
For example , there 's The Skeptical Environmentalist ( Cambridge University Press , 2001 ) in which Bjørn Lomborg discussed global warming and pointed out , documented by >500 mainstream source - references , that Kyoto - type policies would not reduce warming enough to avoid such major consequences as sea - level rises .
Therefore it makes sense to devise adaptations that will be needed in any case , a much better investment than trying to reduce global CO2 emissions .
A rather unremarkable economic argument based solidly on calculations from mainstream data .
So Lomborg was surely just as surprised , astonished , disbelieving , as Duesberg had been , to find that his scholarly discussion placed him beyond the pale of civilized scientific discourse .
The Chair of the International Panel on Climate Change asked , Where is the difference between Lomborg 's view on humans and Hitler's ?
An Australian columnist agreed : Perhaps there is a case for making climate change denial an offence  it is a crime against humanity after all .
An American environmentalist seconded the notion , writing that there should be " war crimes trials for these bastards  some sort of climate Nuremberg . "
Of course those comments were not made in the scientific literature , which does n't countenance that sort of character assassination .
Or so one might hope .
Hope in vain , it turns out , because a book review in Nature ( 414 : 149-50 ) held that Lomborg 's text employs the strategy of those who . . . argue that gay men are n't dying of AIDS , that Jews were n't singled out by the Nazis for extermination .
. . .
So global - warming denialism is as much beyond the pale as AIDS denialism .
Except that  and perhaps you 've noticed 
Duesberg has never denied that AIDS exists , he just has a different explanation for what caused it .
And Lomborg does n't deny that global warming is occurring , he does n't even question that human activities are contributing significantly to it , he is just making a cost - benefit argument .
Of course , both HIV / AIDS and global warming are matters that involve not just science but public policy and large public expenditures .
You would n’t find anything like this in a pure science like astronomy or cosmology , would you ?
Yes , you would .
Yes , you do .

Take cosmology and the Big - Bang theory of the origin of the universe .
Halton Arp was a respected , senior American observational astronomer .
He noticed that some pairs of quasars that are physically close together nevertheless have very different redshifts .
How exciting !
Evidently some redshifts are not Doppler effects , in other words , not owing to rapid relative motion away from us .
That means the universe - expansion calculations have to be revised .
It may not have started as a Big Bang !
That 's just the sort of major potential discovery that scientists are always hoping for , is n't it ?
Certainly not in this case .
Arp was granted no more telescope time to continue his observations .
At age 56 , Halton Arp emigrated to Germany to continue his work at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics .
But Arp was not alone in his views .
Thirty - four senior astronomers from 10 countries , including such stellar figures as Hermann Bondi , Thomas Gold , Amitabha Ghosh , and Jayant Narlikar , sent a letter to Nature pointing out that Big Bang theory
relies on a growing number of hypothetical . . . things . . . never observed ;
that alternative theories can also explain all the basic phenomena of the cosmos
and yet virtually all financial and experimental resources in cosmology go to Big - Bang studies .
Just the sort of discussion that goes on in science all the time , arguing pros and cons of competing ideas .
Except that Nature refused to publish the letter .
The Trouble With Physi ... Lee Smolin Best Price : $ 1.85 Buy New $ 2.99 ( as of 10:41 EST - Details )
It was posted on the Internet , and by now hundreds of additional signatures have been added  just like what happened with the letter the Group for Rethinking AIDS had sent to Nature , Science , the Lancet , and the New England Journal of Medicine , all of which had refused to publish it .
At a mainstream conference on " Outstanding questions for the standard cosmological model "  there was not even a mention of the stunningly outstanding question of those anomalous redshifts .
So the non-Big - Bang cosmologists organized their own separate meeting  again , like AIDS Rethinkers , or like those who question the mainstream dogma about how to cope with global warming .
For some reason , non-Big - Bang cosmology is as much beyond the pale as AIDS " denial " which is n't denial or global warming " denial " which is n't denial .
Then there 's that most abstract of fundamental sciences , theoretical physics .
The problem has long been , How to unify relativity and quantum mechanics ?
Quantum mechanics regards the world as made up of discrete bits whereas relativity regards the world as governed by continuous , not discrete , fields .
Since the mid-1970s , there has been no real progress .
Everyone has been working on so - called " string theory , " which has delivered no testable conclusions and remains a hope , a speculation , not a real theory .
Nevertheless , theoretical physicists who want to look at other approaches can't find jobs , can't get grants , can't get published .
( Read Lee Smolin , The Trouble with Physics . )
You begin to wonder , do n't you , how many other cases there could be in science , where a single theory has somehow captured all the resources ?
And where competent scientists who want to try something different are not only blocked but personally insulted ?

Well , there 's the matter of what killed off the dinosaurs .
Everyone knows that the dinosaurs were killed off 65 million years ago when an asteroid hit the Earth .
Everyone knows that , that is , except the paleontologists , whose specialty this sort of question is supposed to be .
The asteroid theory had been developed by Luis Alvarez , Nobel Laureate in physics , and his son Walter , a geologist .
Paleontologist Dewey McLean had earlier developed a detailed theory based on volcanism  it had long been known that tremendous volcanic activity , the " Deccan Traps , " had occurred at the relevant time .
Do you think Alvarez engaged McLean in civilized , substantive discussion ?
Or would you be surprised to hear that at a conference , Alvarez said to McLean in private : " I 'll wreck your career if you persist . "
And Alvarez did indeed contact McLean 's university and tried to block McLean 's promotion 
I know that for sure because I was Dean of Dewey McLean 's College at the time .
Of course , there 's always been resistance to change in science , as in other human activities .
But this degree of suppression of minority views and the use of gutter language and character assassination makes it seem like a new phenomenon .
At least it has seemed so to the people who have found themselves suddenly ejected from mainstream discourse and resources .
Arp , Duesberg , Lomborg , McLean and other " denialists " of various mainstream theories are surprised because it is n't supposed to be like that in science .
Lomborg does n't know that " AIDS denialists " are treated rather like " global warming denialists . "
Arp does n't know that AIDS and global warming " denialists " have it even worse than those who question the Big Bang .
McLean does n't know that " denialists " about AIDS , Big - Bang , and global warming also have their careers threatened .
Everyone who experiences personally this sort of thing imagines it's a unique experience , because science is n't supposed to be like this .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
But science nowadays IS like this : Disagree with the conventional contemporary scientific wisdom and you wo n't get grants , wo n't get published , will be compared to Holocaust deniers .
And it really was n't always this way .
Nowadays " science , " " pure research , " has become cutthroat in the extreme , and there 's much corner - cutting and sheer dishonesty in science .
For example , NIH newsletters routinely name specific individuals who are being barred from seeking grants for some specified period because of some act of dishonesty .
There was no need , in the good not - so - old days , for a federal Office of Research Integrity  a designation that George Orwell would have relished .
But now we do have such an Office , and at colleges there are Centers for Research Ethics , and publishers put out journals like Accountability in Research  there 's a burgeoning young academic industry devoted to telling scientists how to behave properly .
That 's what science has come to .
Genuine science , the search for better understanding , has been hijacked by self - interest and vested interests and is now captive to knowledge monopolies and research cartels :
A single theory exerts dogmatic control over grants , publications , jobs , promotions .
WHY ??
How did this happen ?
In a follow - up piece , I 'll describe how we arrived at this New World Order in Science .

The Best of Henry Bauer
Washington ( CNN ) --
A handful of Republican senators have proposed a constitutional amendment to limit how long a person may serve in Congress .
Currently , there are no term limits for federal lawmakers , but Sen.
Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , and several of his colleagues are advocating that service in the Senate be limited to 12 years , while lawmakers would only be allowed to serve six years in the House .
" Americans know real change in Washington will never happen until we end the era of permanent politicians , " DeMint said in a statement released by his office .
" As long as members have the chance to spend their lives in Washington , their interests will always skew toward spending taxpayer dollars to buyoff special interests , covering over corruption in the bureaucracy , fundraising , relationship building among lobbyists , and trading favors for pork -- in short , amassing their own power . "
Two - thirds of the House and Senate would need to approve the amendment -- a stumbling block that short - circuited the idea 14 years ago .
The new proposal echoes the Citizen Legislature Act , part of the original Contract with America proposed by Republicans before they won control of Congress in 1994 .
That measure , which would have allowed both senators and members of the House to serve just 12 years , won a majority in the Republican - controlled House in 1995 , but failed because it did not meet the constitutionally - required two - thirds threshold .
" There is no question there are big obstacles in the way , " said Philip Blumel , president of U.S. Term Limits , a nonpartisan organization that advocates putting time restrictions in place .
" It is difficult to pass a constitutional amendment , however the goal is worthwhile and it is very important to the country .
Also , if not now , when ? "
This time around , proponents are not calling on lawmakers who believe in the idea to place a self - imposed term limit on themselves .
" If you are asking people to self - limit , what might happen -- and what did happen -- is that honorable politicians who made the pledge left office , " while others did not , Blumel said .
" The answer to the term - limit supporter is not self - limiting .
It is the body as a whole . "
DeMint , who is currently serving his first six - year term in the Senate , echoed Blumel 's rationale for dismissing self - imposed term limits .
" I want to be clear : demanding that reformers adopt self - imposed term limits is a recipe for self - defeat on this issue , " DeMint said in Tuesday 's statement .
" We lost the battle for term limits after the 1994 Republican Contract with America because we forced our best advocates for reform to go home , while the big - spending career politicians waited them out .
We must have term limits for all or term limits will never succeed .
Only when we apply the same rules to all will we be able to enact vital bipartisan reforms . "
One of the original co-sponsors of the amendment is Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas , who is serving her third term in the Senate , but is expected to resign her seat to focus on a gubernatorial bid .
A spokesman for Hutchison said it is easy to square the fact that the Texas Republican is advocating a cap of two terms , even though she is currently in the middle of her third term .
" Throughout her career she has fought for term limits and continues to do so , and that is why she is co-sponsoring this bill , " said Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky .
" But until it is passed , it would do a disservice to Texas and the people of Texas to do away with the seniority she has gained , unless all the states and all of the senators hold themselves to the same standard . "
The two other original co-sponsors of the amendment are Sen. Tom Coburn , R - Oklahoma , and Sen. Sam Brownback , R - Kansas .
Coburn , a first - term senator , is up for re-election to his second term in 2010 , while Brownback is retiring next year after pledging to serve only two full terms in the Senate .
As congressmen , both voted in favor of the GOP's Contract with America term limit proposal in 1995 .
Coburn , a longtime term - limits supporter , retired from the House in 2000 after serving three terms , based on that pledge .

Mortgage rescue : Credit score killer
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Most troubled homeowners view President Obama 's foreclosure rescue plan as a way out of their financial troubles .
But many do n't realize that entering a trial mortgage modification can actually hurt their credit .
CNNMoney recently received a flood of e-mails from readers complaining about the impact of trial modifications on their credit reports .
To be sure , many people who apply for the president 's plan are already delinquent in their mortgage payments , which wrecks their credit backgrounds .
And obtaining a trial modification should affect borrowers ' scores because it shows they cannot meet their original obligation , experts said .
But being in a months - long trial period may only add to the pain .
Jason Axelrod learned that the hard way .
Axelrod , a municipal employee who lives outside Chicago , entered a trial mortgage modification program this spring .
He had not fallen behind in his mortgage , but he was finding it harder to make ends meet after his overtime was cut and his property taxes skyrocketed .
Told it would not hurt his coveted 750 score , Axelrod secured a $ 565 reduction in his monthly payments .
Eight months later , Axelrod is still stuck in the trial modification , trying to satisfy his loan servicer 's endless requests for documents .
And to his horror , his credit score has plummeted to 644 .
" It 's completely destroyed my credit , " said Axelrod .
" If I had known it would affect my score , I would have never entered the program . "
Representatives at JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , which services Axelrod 's loan , are instructed to tell applicants that entering a modification could impact their credit histories , a bank spokeswoman said .
Despite his weakened credit score , there is at least some good news for Axelrod : After being contacted by CNNMoney.com , JPMorgan Chase said his permanent modification had been approved .
Credit reporting guidelines
Under the president 's plan , troubled borrowers can have their monthly mortgage payments reduced to 31 % of their pre-tax income .
Homeowners are first put in a trial modification for several months to prove they can handle the new commitment and to give the bank time to collect the necessary income and hardship verification documents .
During this period , industry guidelines call for loan servicing companies to report borrowers to the credit bureaus according to their status before they entered the modification - either current or the number of days delinquent .
However , borrowers ' accounts are also designated with a code indicating they are in a partial payment plan .
The coding alone can impact credit scores , which measure a consumer 's financial health and range from 300 to 850 under the FICO system .
The severity depends on how many payments the borrower missed before entering the program .
Those who were current in their mortgages could see their scores fall up to 100 points , according to the Treasury Department .
Just what banks are reporting to the credit bureaus remains a matter of some debate .
Some servicers have been inconsistent in following the guidelines , according to a Treasury official .
Also , they do n't always report that their current borrowers have entered modification plans .
Some 24,000 trial modifications were given to those still current with their payments , as of early September .
A total of 366,000 trial modifications were in effect at that time .
The total number has since risen to just under 700,000 , as of the end of November .
JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , which are among the nation 's largest servicers , declined to be interviewed for this article .
A Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) spokeswoman said the bank follows industry guidelines .
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association , an industry group , servicers are required to report all information about their clients , including whether they are in modification plans .
For seriously delinquent borrowers , this may improve their status somewhat since they will start making payments again .
" If you are in the trial period , over that three month period , you are going to improve your situation in most cases , " said Vicki Vidal , the group 's associate vice president for government affairs .
Once borrowers receive a permanent modification , their payment status is listed as current .
However , the delinquency remains on their credit reports for up to seven years .
On top of that , the longer homeowners are listed as delinquent , the greater the impact on their credit score .
That 's one reason why servicers should be quicker to convert borrowers from trial modifications to permanent adjustments , said Jan Jones , a housing counselor in Alaska .
Financial institutions have come under fire in recent weeks for dragging their feet in evaluating borrowers for permanent adjustments .
" What 's making people upset is the length of time lenders are taking to consider these workout plans , " said Jones , who works for Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Alaska .
Axelrod is already feeling the impact of his lower credit score .
He ordered a new car this summer , believing it would come with a lower monthly payment .
It arrived in mid-December .
But because of his newly blemished credit background , his two credit unions turned him down for a car loan .
His dealership told him the best he could get is a 12 % rate , a hefty hike from the 4.7 % he was paying before .
" This is the biggest nightmare , " he said .
" My credit is completely useless . "
The media analysis group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) issued an action alert September 22 titled " NYT Slams Single - Payer " that described lopsided reporting in a New York Times article about " Medicare for all , " a form of a single - payer health care system .
FAIR noted that the article , titled " Medicare for All ?
‘ Crazy , ’ ‘ Socialized ’ and Unlikely " , laid out a list of arguments against single - payer while failing to include any balancing responses from the option 's supporters .
In explaining the slant , article author Katharine Seelye said she was trying to explain why Medicare - for - all was " not going anywhere . "
" I thought the substance of [ single - payer ] had been dealt with elsewhere many times , " she said .
On October 13 , Times public editor Clark Hoyt conceded that FAIR " had a point , " and agreed that the article excluded the point of view of single - payer health care system supporters .
FAIR said it finds Seelye 's defense " alarming , " and points out that the Times , like the rest of the corporate - owned media , has given the issue of single - payer health care " scant attention . "

Manhattan Declaration 's most eye - opening signature yet
by Jeremy Hooper
Guess who has just been added to the list of Manhattan Declaration signers :
Yes that 's right : Scott Lively .
A man who is most known for being an anti-gay Holocaust revisionist , and who is currently under much scrutiny for his role in the heinous Uganda legislation .
He 's also a man whose ministry is one of only eleven outfits to be listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a bona fide anti-gay hate group , which means that the Manhattan Declaration signatory list now includes representatives from two of the eleven groups on SPLC 's list ( with the Traditional Values Coalition being the other ) .
But hey , if the Manhattan Declaration 's guiding voices over at Focus on the Family and The National Organization For Marriage ( Jim Daly and Robert George , respectively ) want to get in bed with Scott Lively , we 're not gonna kick 'em out .
We will , however , pull back the covers .
* Lively 's signature here : Additional Signers [ Manhattan Declaration ]

* For those not familiar with the Manhattan Declaration :
It 's a new document being supported by " mainstream " pro-fam groups like Focus on the Family .
Read it here .
Information about some of its other overheated signers can be found here .
** UPDATE : Just noticed that Lively is fittingly listed right behind Lafferty / TVC , his fellow SPLC - lister :

I followed the link to Scott Lively 's drivel of a book on Amazon to read the reviews .
What do I find , this from former Assembly member Scott Baldwin 77 district , CA : Excellent book !
This book gives ample evidence that the sexual perversion of homosexuality easily lends itself to authoritarian impulses .
Not only do the authors make a strong case that homosexuals played a critical role in the formation of the Nazi Party , but they also show how many Nazi leaders in Europe and the USA also came from the gay movement .
The myth that all gays were persecuted by the Nazis is demolished in this book -- most of the camp guards were sadistic gays .
The underlying theme is that when a society accepts a moral relativistic philosophy ( leading to acceptance of homosexuality ) it could very well lead to the eventual destruction of our constitutional rights .
The authors show that the reason why the Nazis were so anti-semitic had to with historical reasons .
The Jewish culture -- with its old testament ethical system -- brought an end to the macho - gay / Warrior mentality that dominated so much of ancient Europe , especially ancient Rome and Greece .
These ancient pagen cultures , which glorified sex between warriors , were worshiped by the Nazis who blamed the Jews for the introduction of biblical morality which , of course , condemned homosexuality and ended much of the pagan lifestyle in Europe .
I highly recomment this book .

Scott Lively tortured Oregonians for years with his anti-gay rhetoric when he was working with the Oregon Citizen 's Alliance .
He is fundamentally certifiable and dishonest .
In his professional c.v. , he lists himself , with incredible irony , as a " Human Rights Advocate " claiming to have received a " Certificatè " from the Institute of International Human Rights , Strasbourg , France .
I 'm sure that technically he earned his " certificate of participation " or perhaps a " certificate of attendence " as the IIHR calls them in their brochures but to state in a professional bio that he has a " certificatè " is disingenuous at best .

It only takes one lying liar who is willing to go on record by fabricating the lies , to provide fodder for all of the other lying liars to quote ( with impunity ) as if the lies were gospel ( which , come to think of it , may not be that far from a perfect analogy ) .
And , these lying liars have quite the cabal of exceptionally eager liars to turn to as the source of their lies .

Jeremy said " It 's a new document being supported by " mainstream " pro-fam groups like Focus on the Family . " .
As a matter of accuracy one should never use the term pro-" family " without quotes - they are not pro-family , the are pro-antigay or " family " .
Its not Focus on the Family , but Focus on the " Family " .

Ha , priya .
Out of the approximately ten billion times I 've written " pro-family , " you found the one time I did so without quotes .
I promise to never let it happen again ;-)

I think that Rachel Maddow should start an exhaustive new investigative journalism segment called " Family Ties ! "
Where she , obviously , documents all of the sordid ties that religiots , politicos , and pundits have to the Talibanistic cult - The Family .

In 1991 , Lively forcibly ejected lesbian activist Catherine Stauffer from a private Oregon Citizens Alliance event in a church that she was filming .

Stauffer received a monetary judgment of over $ 31,000 against Lively and the OCA in 1992 .

Managing editor Rick Stengel announced , on the Today Show , that the Federal Reserve chairman gets the nod .
He Noted that Bernanke led " the most powerful , least understood government force shaping our lives . "
Here 's the announcement , and some of Stengel 's rationale .
The magazine , essentially , feels that he stopped a recession becoming a depression .
It comes the day before a Senate committee vote on whether Bernanke deserves a second term .

So Modern Warfare : Remastered is very much on the way , bundled exclusively with Call of Duty : Infinite Warfare 's special edition but how does it look ?
Well the good news is that devs Raven - with Infinity Ward keeping an eye on things - has given the original far more than just a lick of HD paint .
The images below were handily collected by cantsaymynamehere on Reddit from Infinity Ward 's livestream of Infinite Warfare .
There 's not just a couple of new bullet holes and textures added here and there but a complete overhaul of lighting and design .
Take a flick through and try not to be too sad about what you thought were the visuals of the future back in 2007 .
Seen something newsworthy ?
Tell us !
Here 's a modestly clever idea that will never come to pass in a thousand years because it 's absolutely not the way modern life or America work right now , but it 's nevertheless all sorts of delightfully ironic fun to ponder anyway .
I 'm reading a bit about how our fine , God-loving nation just executed John Allen Muhammad , aka the Washington D.C. sniper , injected his remorseless flesh with a megadose of sodium pentothal as dozens of people actually chose to sit behind a glass wall and watch him writhe and twitch and die sans any final statement or single sign of penitence or satisfying explanation as to his murderous actions .
If you like , you can read the story right now on this fair site , and then jump to the bottom where you will certainly find a reeking cesspool of some of the most nasty , disturbing anonymous comments from fine , God-fearing Americans , and then proceed calmly to feeling utterly soiled , disgusted and sad about the human race as a whole .
Here 's a better idea : Skip that , and instead check out the recent study from the Death Penalty Information Center , which states that after all court costs , fees and various social machinations are factored in , the average death sentence costs each state that supports it about $ 30 million per inmate , running well into hundreds of millions in wasted taxpayer dollars every year .
I say " wasted " because the study proves that , even from a simple economic perspective , the death penalty is ridiculous and culturally debilitating , and the various states in question could save hundreds of millions a year simply by locking the prisoner up for life .
To be honest , the first idea to occur to me was n't even all that clever .
I initially wondered what would happen if you took , say , 30 of the nastiest , most hateful , eye - for - an - eye death penalty supporters and anonymous commenters in America today , and made them the following offer :
I will hereby give each of you $ 1 million if you agree that we will not kill this insane , murderous criminal , and instead just let him rot in prison for the rest of his life without a chance of parole .
A million bucks , all for you .
Or , we kill him , waste the $ 30 million and you get nothing .
Do you know how many would accept ?
Of course you do .
All of them .
Which means , for most , support of the death penalty is no serious moral conviction at all ; it 's merely an ugly , black hunk of reactionary spittle , the bleak human vengeance synapse writ large , something reptilian and small and just about as far from our often hypocritical concepts of God and forgiveness , compassion and understanding , as you can possibly get .
Thankfully , this admittedly spiteful thought soon passed and quickly led to the wider idea I mentioned at the top of this column .
Do you know what $ 30 million can buy these days ?
What your average cash - strapped urban playground could do with that kind of money , particularly during a recession ?
Here 's my simple and semi-obvious idea : what if Washington D.C. had taken the same $ 30 million , and instead of killing a single remorseless criminal , created upwards of 600 full - ride college scholarships for lower - income or minority students , at 50 grand each .
In other words , for every criminal a given state is seeking to execute -- like , for example , the Fort Hood killer , who they say might well be eligible for the death penalty -- we take the same tens of millions in taxpayer dollars and send hundreds of kids through college instead , kids who otherwise would never have been able to afford it and in fact might 've ended up on the streets or in prison .
We 'll call it the Lethal Injection College Fund .
It shall , by its very existence , do nothing less than completely transform the ugly American revenge impulse into something celebratory and optimistic .
We shall transmute a brutal crime into a glimmer of hope and possibility .
From dark to light .
From excrement , flowers .
From our most violent nightmares , a hint of grace .
What a thing .
In 2008 , the United States executed about 30 males , all by lethal injection , unless they lived in South Carolina , in which case it was electrocution preceded by being forced to stare for two full weeks at a poster of Lindsay Graham .
Horrible .
That 's nearly $ 1 billion in taxpayer money wasted last year alone across the U.S. -- mostly in the South -- just to kill a few criminals , just to keep alive a vile and primitive idea that 's proven to be not the slightest deterrent to violent crime , and only puts us on par with some of the world 's most cruel and sadistic third - world nations .
Theoretically , that 's 18,000 kids we could 've put through college .
One dead criminal , or 18,000 educated kids .
What a choice .
Did you note the fascinating kicker regarding the Lethal Injection College Fund ?
The amazing twist ?
Among those theoretical 18,000 , it 's a safe bet that , had it not been for the LICF , many would 've eventually wound up in prison themselves , a few probably on death row .
Translation :
One violent criminal saves countless potential future criminals from the same fate .
There 's a karmic lesson in there somewhere .
Do not misunderstand .
I am well aware of the utter absurdity of this idea , not to mention that you could take the same simplistic formula and apply it just about anywhere -- for example , say , flipping the insane cost of a single U.S. military fighter jet ( also about $ 30 million , ironically ) into how many homeless puppies could be saved if we used that money for shelters .
I realize that the economy simply does not work this way .
Unless it does .
Because of course , the death penalty has a special , particularly nasty tang .
It is no weapon for peace .
It is no advancement of the human experiment .
It only serves to devolve , regress , keep us low and brutal and mean .
I would like to report that we are nearing the end of the reactionary bloodlust phase of the American experiment , that , with the Obama - inspired resurgence of positivism and the concomitant lessening of the bogus , pseudo - cowboy American fantasy , the dark energy that seems to welcome the death penalty is lessening , and it feels as if we are about to join the rest of the civilized world in rejecting this inhumane , animalistic practice .
But of course , I can't possibly say such a thing .
We are nowhere near that point .
Not when 65 percent of Americans still support the death penalty , bullets are sold out across the land , and millions absolutely refuse to evolve past paranoia and fear and vengeance , the ugliest of American cornerstones and the most clenched , spiritually bereft aspects of our national identity .
And now , John Allen Muhammad is dead , and no one anywhere feels the slightest bit better , not really , not if they 're honest , not if they truly look their god in the eye and try to justify this dark , spirtually bereft human impulse .
And , oh yes , 600 hypothetical kids will now never go to college .
Oh well .
It was all just a silly fantasy anyway .

A maker of some of the most popular games for the iPhone has been surreptitiously collecting users ' cell numbers without their permission , according to a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday .
The complaint claims best - selling games made by Storm8 contained secret code that bypassed safeguards built into the iPhone to prevent the unauthorized snooping of user information .
The Redwood City , California , company , which claims its games have been downloaded more than 20 million times , has no need to collect the numbers .
" Nonetheless , Storm8 makes use of the ' backdoor ' method to access , collect , and transmit the wireless phone numbers of the iPhones on which its games are installed , " states the complaint , which was filed in US District Court in Northern California .
" Storm8 does so or has done so in all of its games . "
Messages left for Storm8 representatives were n't returned .
The complaint , filed on behalf of iPhone owner and gamer Michael Turner of Lynnwood , Washington , seeks class action status so other users of Storm8 games can also join .
It claims that as of Monday , five of the companies games ranked in the top 50 free apps on Apple 's App Store , and seven of them ranked in the top 100 .
Titles include World War , iMobsters , Racing Live , Vampires Live , Kingdoms Live , Zombies Live , and Rockstars Live .
The complaint claims Storm8 has violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Calfornia 's computer crime law , among other statutes .
It 's not the first time Storm8 has been accused of spying on its users .
In August , SFGate.com writer Yobi Benjamin analyzed precisely what information his iPhone was sending to Storm8 and dropped it into this column .
" I would not want just anyone to have my personal phone number , " he wrote .
" Worst of all , the information is transmitted unencrypted in plain text . "
Other sites have made similar claims about Storm8 titles .
In addition to taking the game maker to task , some critics have also blamed Apple for allowing the software to be sold in its heavily controlled App Store .
( Storm8 titles such as iMobster continue to be available there . )
Storm8 responded by acknowledging it had been collected user phone numbers and blamed the situation on " a bug that has been fixed . "
Attorneys for the plaintiff are n't buying that .
" Storm8 's characterizations of its practice of harvesting phone numbers as a ' bug ' and an ' oversight ' are false , " they wrote .
" Storm8 could not have accidentally harvested its users ' phone numbers - it used very specific and specialized software code to do so . " ®
A stray Chabrol , the next Juno and more Toni Servillo brilliance are among this year 's hidden gems on the festival circuit .
Hunt them down now before they 're buried for ever
Home festivaling is one of the few perks of losing mobility through a back injury .
What better way to cover 300 + screen events across the UK for Empire Online 's Festivals & Seasons page than letting them come to you ?
Much festival fare falls squarely into the three - star category .
But , every now and then , a disc arrives in the post containing a gem that leaves you wondering how the distributors missed it .
So here 's a personal selection of the festival favourites that have either failed to secure a UK release in 2009 or are not currently on the schedule for next year .
10 ) Let 's Dance ( dir. Noémie Lvovsky , France )
Festivals are invariably stuffed with quirky ensemble pieces , with Laís Bodanzky 's superbly choreographed The Ballroom and Ivy Ho 's intricately structured Claustrophobia among this year 's best .
But nothing compares to Noémie Lvovsky 's audaciously frantic celebration of late - life exuberance , which is all the more remarkable as it succeeds in being hilariously offbeat about Alzheimer 's and the Holocaust .
The ever - reliable Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi excels as the dutiful Jewish daughter concerned about parents Jean - Pierre Marielle and Bulle Ogier , who have lived apart for 25 years while remaining married .
But it 's Marielle 's romance with kooky teacher Sabine Azéma that ensures the action keeps veering off in wholly unexpected directions .
9 ) Constantin and Elena ( dir. Andrei Dascalescu , Romania )
Sharing a sense of bucolic melancholy with Slovakian Marko Skop 's Osadné , Andrei Dascalescu 's profile of his grandparents captures a passing lifestyle with respect rather than regret .
Together for 55 years , Constantin and Elena potter around their Edenic garden in a picture - book village in north - eastern Romania .
He belts out tunes that sustained wartime morale , while she trills the hymns learned at her childhood convent .
They are the epitome of soulmates , and while they wish they had more time ahead of them , they view what they have achieved on behalf of their community and family with a quiet pride that is deeply moving .
8 ) Ballast ( dir. Lance Hammer , USA )
When it came to hardscrabble landscapes , only Hungarian newcomer Csaba Bollok 's Iska 's Journey and Russia documentarist Oleg Morozov 's Until the Next Resurrection could match the waterlogged expanses of the Mississippi Delta captured by British cinematographer Lol Crawley for Lance Hammer 's directorial debut .
This grindingly rigorous and austerely authentic tale of an African - American shopkeeper trying to reconnect with his family is superbly enacted by the non-professional cast , while Kent Sparling 's inspired sound design saps the spirit with each squelching footstep and doleful car journey along a characterless backwater highway .
Simultaneously beautiful and bleak , warm and sombre , this is what slice - of - life cinema should look and feel like .
7 ) Bellamy ( dir. Claude Chabrol , France )
It 's inconceivable that Claude Chabrol 's first collaboration with Gérard Depardieu wo n't eventually find a distributor .
The study of a Maigret - like police inspector who can't resist investigating an insurance scam while holidaying in Provence with wife Marie Bunel , this is as much a domestic drama as a policier .
With Edouard Serra 's camera prowling around locations in Nimes and Sète , this is a typically atmospheric Chabrol outing that delves into his recurring themes of bourgeois hypocrisy and the unfathomable logic of love .
Dedicated to Georges Simenon and Brassens , this cryptic treatise on ambiguous motivation and flawed perception could easily give rise to a sequel .
6 ) Everyone Else ( dir. Maren Ade , Germany )
Birgit Minichmayr won the Best Actress prize at Berlin for her superb performance in Maren Ade 's sophomore feature , as a vulnerable eccentric whose spikiness makes her duel with introspective architect Lars Eidinger so compelling and excruciating .
Recalling Giulieta Masina in Nights of Cabiria ( 1957 ) and Johanna Wokalek in Barefoot ( 2005 ) , Minichmayr is a bundle of contradictions and provocations .
But it 's the courageous way that Ade sustains the emotional intensity and dares to risk such an unconventional denouement that puts this on a par with Ingmar Bergman 's Scenes from a Marriage ( 1973 ) as a study of the inexplicable dynamics of togetherness .
5 ) Dear Lemon , Lima ( dir. Suzi Yoonessi , USA )
The debuting Suzi Yoonessi ably remains the right side of twee in turning her adolescent journal into a delightful misfit comedy .
Taking her cues from Ghost World ( 2001 ) and Juno ( 2007 ) , she treats the darker moments with due gravity .
But she also uses fond nostalgia and gentle lampoon to explore identity , peer pressure and belonging without ever patronising her protagonists or the audience .
Drolly designed to temper the kitsch of 13 year - old Savanah Wiltfong 's pastel - coloured imagination with the rougher realities of her Alaskan existence , this rousing celebration of heritage and diversity culminates in Wiltfong 's team of no-hopers triumphing in the school 's Snowstorm Survivor competition .
4 ) The Girl By the Lake ( dir. Andrea Molaioli , Italy )
Relocating Karin Fossum 's novel , Do n't Look Back , from Norway to the Friulian Dolomites , Andrea Molaioli 's cerebral whodunit won 10 Donatello Awards in its native Italy .
Having mischievously trailed a red- herring case of child abduction , Molaioli springs the murder of a vicacious babysitter and begins to reveal the dark secrets lurking behind the locale 's postcard façade .
Ramiro Civita 's cinematography superbly conveys the chill beneath the surface tranquility .
But it 's Toni Servillo 's mercurial detective that leaves the deepest impression , as he combines the impassivity familiar from his collaborations with Paolo Sorrentino with a Maigret - like inscrutability that depends as much upon reading character as unearthing clues .
3 ) Snow Prince ( dir. Joji Matsuoka , Japan )
In my opinion , the best kidpix usually emanate from northern Europe .
But in relocating Ouida 's much - loved 1872 novel , The Dog of Flanders , to Japan in the mid-1930s , director Joji Matsuoka and Departures scribe Kundo Koyama have produced the most beautiful children 's film of the year .
Everything about this poignant account of bourgeois Marino Kuwajima 's adolescent friendship with impoverished artist Shintaro Morimoto is exquisite .
The photography and period design are impeccable , while the script deftly acquaints younger viewers with the good that can still emerge from the harsher realities of life .
This is the kind of family entertainment that Hollywood has long forgotten how to make .
2) The Yellow House ( dir. Amor Hakkar , Algeria )
Among the many films about middle - aged males struggling to retain their niche and dignity in the face of drastic social change , Hajime Kadoi's Vacation and Rashid Masharawi's Laila 's Birthday were bettered only by Amor Hakkar 's charmingly understated drama .
Hakkar also stars as an Algerian vegetable farmer , who trundles across country on his Lambretta tricycle to collect the body of the son killed on national service before returning to devote himself to rekindling grieving wife Tounes Ait Ali 's love for life .
Indebted to Iranian and Kurdish cinema , as well as David Lynch 's The Straight Story ( 1999 ) , this is screen humanism at its most elegiac and sanguine .
1 ) The Portuguese Nun ( dir. Eugène Green , Portugal )
Strewn with long silences and even longer takes , this is a deadpan reverie on love and faith , film and life .
Yet it 's also impishly poetic and singularly moving and would form a fine double bill with Michael Whyte 's No Greater Love .
In Lisbon to shoot De Guilleragues 's Letters of a Portuguese Nun , atheist actress Leonor Baldaque has an epiphany after encountering Sister Ana Moreira in a backstreet church .
Some will bridle at Eugène Green 's highly stylised minimalism , the self - reflexive friskiness , the surfeit of literary and cinematic references and the extended fado interludes .
But for all its idiosyncratic charm , this is a deceptively passionate and poignant picture .
Google
Talk is now speaking to other Jabber servers , nearly six months after the company released the instant messaging application .
Open federation is now part of Google Talk , meaning the software can communicate eith other Jabber - based instant messaging clients , according to Google 's developer FAQ .
This enhanced interoperability is a departure from the software 's initial incarnation .
Google Talk was released as a Google Beta in late August to much fanfare .
But it was missing one key critical feature :
The ability to communicate with other Jabber XMPP servers .
