I wrote Practical Common Lisp because I felt that Common Lisp needed a new introductory book that could ease folks raised on other languages into Common Lisp and then show them what it ’s really all about .
Based on emails from readers , reviews on Amazon , word of mouth in the Lisp world , and the fact that the online version of PCL is the top hit when you Google for “ lisp book ” , I ’ll say I succeeded tolerably well .
So imagine my dismay when someone pointed out to me today the Google results for “ lisp tutorial ” .
The top hit is a page which apparently has n’t been updated since around 1999 and is n’t really a tutorial anyway , so much as a large list of links including a link to the Hyperspec when it was hosted at harlequin.com .

The next few “ lisp tutorial ” hits are — with all due respect — exactly the sort of dated , dry tutorials that inspired me to write Practical Common Lisp in the first place and to do a deal with Apress to allow me to keep it online even after the dead tree version was published .
Practical Common Lisp does n’t appear anywhere , as far as I can tell , in the results for “ lisp tutorial ” .
With that in mind I did a small bit of search engine optimization today to make sure that the phrase “ Common Lisp tutorial ” appears on the main page of the Practical Common Lisp web site .
If you also think Lisp might be better served if PCL was at least one of the results returned to a would - be Lisper searching for a Lisp tutorial you can help out : if you have a web page where it would be reasonable to do so , consider linking to the url http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/ with a link text of “ lisp tutorial ” or “ common lisp tutorial ” .
Yes , I ’m asking you to participate in a Google bombing .
But it ’s for a good cause .
Think of the children .
Update : Based on the first couple folks I ’ve seen providing links to the PCL website ( thanks , guys ! )
I must not have made myself quite clear enough .
The name of the game in a Google bombing is for everyone to use the same text for the link .
If you want to play along , your HTML should look like this :
< a href = " http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/ "
>Common Lisp tutorial </a>
or
< a href = " http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/ " >

CARACAS , Venezuela , Aug. 14 — President Hugo Chávez will unveil a project to change the Constitution on Wednesday that is expected to allow him to be re-elected indefinitely , a move that would enhance his authority to accelerate a socialist - inspired transformation of Venezuelan society .
The removal of term limits for Mr. Chávez , which is at the heart of the proposal , is expected to be accompanied by measures circumscribing the authority of elected governors and mayors , who would be prevented from staying in power indefinitely , according to versions of the project leaked in recent weeks .
Willian Lara , the communications minister , said Mr. Chávez would announce the project before the National Assembly , where all 167 lawmakers support the president .
Supporters of Mr. Chávez , who was re-elected last year with some 60 percent of the vote , also control the Supreme Court , the entire federal bureaucracy , public oil and infrastructure companies and every state government but two .
The aim of the overhaul is “ to guarantee to the people the largest amount of happiness possible , ” Mr. Lara said at a news conference on Tuesday .

Choose a web host that is going to provide your needs as they stand now as well as where they lead to in the future .
Here we go :
1. Understand the different types of hosts : shared , collocated , unmanaged dedicated , and managed dedicated .
2 . Go for stability , not just size .
Research how long the hosting business has been in operation .
See if they have recently changed ownership and if they show positive cash flow .
3 . The possession of fully redundant data centers .
If you are considering doing business with a smaller hosting vendor , ensure that they have adequate power and connectivity capabilities .
Inquire as to the number of lines the facility has .
Do they possess an on -site generator ?
Does the generator receive regular checks and maintenance ?
What is the average utilization of the connections available ?
Also , check other customer ’s reviews of the hosting services .
Same as any business , the hosting vendor should be able to provide good references .
The highest standard in Web hosting
1 – Security and Reliability .
In today 's world , with the threat of viruses , hackers , and data thieves , you need extra layers of electronic protection .
Make sure that your Web hosting provider keeps your data behind firewalls , protected by dynamic encryption and port blocking , and reinforced by a knowledgeable , dedicated security staff .
Be certain that your provider offers automatic , fail - safe redundancy so that when a server fails or is disabled by an attack , another will immediately take up the load and continue without interruption .
2 – Stability .
Your needs are likely to change as your business grows , so the flexibility to upgrade your service is important .
Can your
Web hosting provider grow with your needs should your business evolve from a starter Web site to a high traffic e-commerce site ?
Does it offer an array of services , including shared and dedicated hosting packages ?
3 – Service and Support . 24 x 7 .
When something goes wrong with your service , you will want fast , intelligent answers and the problem resolved immediately , regardless of when it occurs .
Consequently , you should investigate your hosting provider 's ability to proactively inform customers before t becomes an emergency .
Having access to self - help tools and trained technicians enables you to obtain answers quickly and streamlines your process to resolution .
4 – Financial Stability .
Your Web host is a direct reflection of your business .
Be sure to choose a hosting partner with the financial strength to succeed in all economic times .
Failure on its part puts your business at risk .
Seek a provider that has proven experience in providing business class hosting with a state of the art network , unsurpassed reliability , and superlative customer service .
Different modes of web host
Domain - based shared hosting :
It works on the Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) technology and provides each website with a unique URL , even though they are hosted on a single server .
The VPS technology achieves by creating effective partitions in the server and gets them to act as individual servers .
Name - based shared hosting :
In name - based shared hosting , a websites name appears as a subset of the service providers name .
Example of such service providers is Geocities , blogspot etc .
Directory - based shared hosting :
With respect to directory - based shared hosting , the customer 's website will be mentioned as a directory in the host domain name .
The most important point that comes through with shared hosting is the relative lack of a dedicated IP address .
That ’s because most of the web security apparatus are applicable on the IP address level .
That ’s the reason why , dedicated servers are capable of providing a more secure environment ; as they guarantee a unique IP address .
choosing a web host for an adult website
Adult hosting basically provides a platform for those customers or organizations dealing with adult industry or pornography .
It is very similar to normal web hosting as you get an option to choose either dedicated server hosting or shared server hosting .
You also get webspace to host the domain , bandwidth , email addresses , domains , subdomains etc .
A customer can host Adult or Porn Data in the form of images , videos , animations and written content .
If a customer is making a plan of building an adult website then the customer should keep in mind the laws which are very strict and before taking the adult hosting from any service provider customer should read all the laws that apply on hosting an adult website .
Searching the best adult hosting company can be time - consuming .
As it is not to rate the adult hosting company without even trying that adult hosting provider is a good web hosting provider or not .
Let 's take a look at top adult hosting companies
Posted by Big Gav in biofuel , cellulosic ethanol , energy , ethanol , oil
Its been over a year since I last did a roundup of cellulosic ethanol news - time for another one .
Wired has a good introductory article on the subject ( albeit one viewing the subject through rose coloured glasses ) - " One Molecule Could Cure Our Addiction to Oil " which looks at some of the companies pioneering the underlying technology - Mascoma , Novozymes and Verenium .
In the sidebar there are 4 Alternative Technologies On The Brink , courtesy of Dave Roberts - Energy storage with ultracapacitors , geothermal power , thin film solar and synfuel .
While the article thinks biofuels are a better bet than transitioning electric powered vehicles in the medium term , I 'd have to say that this seems both incorrect and a far less than optimal way to proceed .
On a blackboard , it looks so simple : Take a plant and extract the cellulose .
Add some enzymes and convert the cellulose molecules into sugars .
Ferment the sugar into alcohol .
Then distill the alcohol into fuel .
One , two , three , four — and we 're powering our cars with lawn cuttings , wood chips , and prairie grasses instead of Middle East oil .
Unfortunately , passing chemistry class does n't mean acing economics .
Scientists have long known how to turn trees into ethanol , but doing it profitably is another matter .
We can run our cars on lawn cuttings today ; we just can't do it at a price people are willing to pay .
The problem is cellulose .
Found in plant cell walls , it 's the most abundant naturally occurring organic molecule on the planet , a potentially limitless source of energy .
But it 's a tough molecule to break down .
Bacteria and other microorganisms use specialized enzymes to do the job , scouring lawns , fields , and forest floors , hunting out cellulose and dining on it .
Evolution has given other animals elegant ways to do the same : Cows , goats , and deer maintain a special stomach full of bugs to digest the molecule ; termites harbor hundreds of unique microorganisms in their guts that help them process it .
For scientists , though , figuring out how to convert cellulose into a usable form on a budget driven by gas - pump prices has been neither elegant nor easy .
To tap that potential energy , they 're harnessing nature 's tools , tweaking them in the lab to make them work much faster than nature intended .
While researchers work to bring down the costs of alternative energy sources , in the past two years policymakers have finally reached consensus that it 's time to move past oil .
The reasoning varies — reducing our dependence on unstable oil - producing regions , cutting greenhouse gases , avoiding ever - increasing prices — but it 's clear that the US needs to replace billions of gallons of gasoline with alternative fuels , and fast .
Even oil industry veteran George W. Bush has declared that " America is addicted to oil " and set a target of replacing 20 percent of the nation 's annual gasoline consumption — 35 billion gallons — with renewable fuels by 2017 .
But how ?
Hydrogen is too far - out , and it's no easy task to power our cars with wind - or solar - generated electricity .
The answer , then , is ethanol .
Unfortunately , the ethanol we can make today — from corn kernels — is a mediocre fuel source .
Corn ethanol is easier to produce than the cellulosic kind ( convert the sugar to alcohol and you 're basically done ) , but it generates at best 30 percent more energy than is required to grow and process the corn — hardly worth the trouble .
Plus , the crop 's fertilizer - intensive cultivation pollutes waterways , and increased demand drives up food costs ( corn prices doubled last year ) .
And anyway , the corn ethanol industry is projected to produce , at most , the equivalent of only 15 billion gallons of fuel by 2017 .
" We ca n't make 35 billion gallons ' worth of gasoline out of ethanol from corn , " says Dartmouth engineering and biology professor Lee Lynd , " and we probably do n't want to . "
Cellulosic ethanol , in theory , is a much better bet .
Most of the plant species suitable for producing this kind of ethanol — like switchgrass , a fast - growing plant found throughout the Great Plains , and farmed poplar trees — are n't food crops .
And according to a joint study by the US Departments of Agriculture and Energy , we can sustainably grow more than 1 billion tons of such biomass on available farmland , using minimal fertilizer .
In fact , about two - thirds of what we throw into our landfills today contains cellulose and thus potential fuel .
Better still : Cellulosic ethanol yields roughly 80 percent more energy than is required to grow and convert it .
So a wave of public and private funding , bringing newfound optimism , is pouring into research labs .
Venture capitalists have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in cellulosic - technology startups .
BP has announced that it 's giving $ 500 million for an Energy Biosciences Institute run by the University of Illinois and UC Berkeley .
The Department of Energy pledged $ 385 million to six companies building cellulosic demonstration plants .
In June the DOE added awards for three $ 125 million bioenergy centers to pursue new research on cellulosic biofuels .
There 's just one catch :
No one has yet figured out how to generate energy from plant matter at a competitive price .
The result is that no car on the road today uses a drop of cellulosic ethanol .
Cellulose is a tough molecule by design , a fact that dates back 400 million years to when plants made the move from ocean to land and required sturdy cell walls to keep themselves upright and protected against microbes , the elements , and eventually animals .
Turning that defensive armor into fuel involves pretreating the plant material with chemicals to strip off cell - wall protections .
Then there are two complicated steps : first , introducing enzymes , called cellulases , to break the cellulose down into glucose and xylose ; and second , using yeast and other microorganisms to ferment those sugars into ethanol .
The step that has perplexed scientists is the one involving enzymes — proteins that come in an almost infinite variety of three - dimensional structures .
They are at work everywhere in living cells , usually speeding up the chemical reactions that break down complex molecules .
Because they 're hard to make from scratch , scientists generally extract them from microorganisms that produce them naturally .
But the trick is producing the enzymes cheaply enough at an industrial scale and speed .
Today 's cellulases are the enzyme equivalent of vacuum tubes : clunky , slow , and expensive .
Now , flush with cash , scientists and companies are racing to develop the cellulosic transistor .
Some researchers are trying to build the ultimate microbe in the lab , one that could combine the two key steps of the process .
Others are using " directed evolution " and genetic engineering to improve the enzyme - producing microorganisms currently in use .
Still others are combing the globe in search of new and better bugs .
It 's bio -construction versus bio - tinkering versus bio-prospecting , all with the single goal of creating the perfect enzyme cocktail .
...
Step 1 : Thermochemical treatment
The raw plant feedstock is treated with chemicals — often dilute sulfuric acid — to break down cell walls and make the cellulose accessible .
Step 2 : Enzymes
A mix of cellulase enzymes is then added to convert the cellulose and hemicellulose molecules into the simple sugars glucose and xylose .
Step 3 : Fermentation Yeast or bacteria are added , converting the sugar into a mixture of ethanol and water , what refineries call " the beer . "
Step 4 : Distillation
The ethanol is refined and purified , producing a fuel that could one day end up in your gas tank .
The U.S. uses about 9.2 million barrels ( 219,000 gallons ) of Finished Motor Gasoline a day .
Automobile engines can run on an E10 blend , i.e. , fuel that is 10 % ethanol , with the only difference , a barely discernible reduction in mileage .
“ Regular ” gasoline has a value of 85 - 92 g CO2 eq / MJ , while cellulosic ethanol , when derived from municipal solid waste , has a value of about 5 g CO2 eq / MJ. ...
There are approximately 4.5 million E85 capable motor vehicles now on American roads .
If that many vehicles were operating on an E - 85 blend , with ethanol made from cellulosic feedstock — Okeelanta bagasse or otherwise , then Americans might be able to make some claim to responsible action toward the mitigation of climate change .
Autoblog Green relays an announcement from Mascoma Corporation about the five - million - gallon - a - year cellulosic ethanol Tennessee plant to open in 2009 .
The company intends that this facility be the first in the country to produce cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass .
Mascoma ’s partner in the plant is the University of Tennessee , which has been conducting research that suggests “ that Tennessee is capable of generating over one billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass alone . ”
Note that while the research was with switchgrass alone , the push is for relatively small amounts of cellulosic feedstock mixed with a coal slurry .
With East Tennessee in the Eastern coal belt , it would be difficult to imagine that this effort is something other than another CBTL ( Coal / Biomass To Liquids ) greenwash .
On September 14 POET Biorefining , formerly the Broin Companies , opened their 21st ethanol production facility , a 65 million gallon per year plant that brings
Poet 's total capacity to 1.1 billion gallons per year of corn ethanol , making POET the largest producer of ethanol in the world .
The facility , the 27th ( including administrative facilites ) constructed by POET since they were founded 20 years ago , is equipped with technology that decreases its environmental footprint .
That technology includes POET ’s patent - pending BPX ™ process that eliminates the need for heat in the cooking process of producing ethanol , reducing energy usage by 8 - 15 percent in comparison with conventional plants .
It will also be outfitted with a regenerative thermal oxidizer that eliminates up to 99.9 percent of air emissions .
The BPX process is a patent - pending raw starch hydrolysis process that converts starch to sugar , which then ferments to ethanol without heat .
The process not only reduces energy costs , but also releases additional starch content for conversion to ethanol , increases protein content and quality of co-products , increases co-product flowability , potentially increases plant throughput and significantly decreases plant emissions .
POET Biorefining - Portland , IN will utilize 22 million bushels of corn from the area to produce 65 million gallons of ethanol and 178,000 tons of Dakota Gold Enhanced Nutrition Distillers Products ™ per year .
The $ 105 million facility will provide around 40 jobs with an annual payroll of about $ 2 million .
In February 2007 POET and the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) agreed to jointly fund the development of a cellulosic ethanol plant .
The DOE announced a grant that will fund a portion of Poet 's $ 200 million expansion of a conventional corn dry mill facility in Emmetsburg , Iowa into a bio -refinery that will include production of cellulosic ethanol from corn cobs and stover .
The project will convert a conventional corn dry mill facility in Emmetsburg , Iowa into a commercial scale biorefinery designed to utilize advanced corn fractionation and lignocellulosic conversion technologies to produce ethanol from corn fiber and corn cobs and stover .
Known as Project LIBERTY , the expansion will utilize an existing infrastructure with projected costs for the increased capabilities at just over $ 200 million dollars .
The expansion will take approximately 30 months and is slated to begin as soon as the terms of the agreement with the DOE are finalized .
Discusions of the final details of that agreement are still underway .
Poet is currently able to produce about 435 gallons of ethanol per acre ( based on 150 bushels per acre ) .
Cellulosic ethanol production from corn cobs adds another 80 gallons per acre and fractionated fiber adds another 40 gallons per acre , potentially bringing each acre ’s ethanol production to more than 550 gallons .
To complement their own technology , POET has forged relationships with other leaders in the cellulosic ethanol field .
It has licensed a unique integrated lignocellulose conversion technology package developed by DuPont that converts high volumes of both the cellulose and hemicellulose in corn plants into ethanol .
They are also collaborating with Novozymes , a world leader in industrial biotechnology , on providing state - of - the - art enzyme technology in the cellulosic biomass field .
POET is taking two phases to producing cellulosic ethanol , the first phase will use only the cobs and the second phase will use as much of the rest of the plant as possible without comprimising soil quality .
By adding cellulosic production to an existing grain ethanol plant , POET will be able to produce 11 percent more ethanol from a bushel of corn , 27 percent more from an acre of corn , while almost completely eliminating fossil fuel consumption and decreasing water usage by 24 percent .
In the future , in cellulosic plants , they will use some of the leftover lignin to power the entire facility and almost , or possibly completely , eliminate the need to power the facility with any fossil energy .
I believe our generation faces a sobering choice :
Take serious steps to reduce our fossil fuel usage now - and this will undoubtedly entail some amount of hardship - or leave it to our children to face a great deal of hardship .
I firmly believe this is our choice , and we must look to solutions that move us in that direction .
I also believe that if most people understood that we are pushing a very serious problem onto our children - instead of assuming scientists and engineers will solve the problem - then we would collectively pursue a solution with far greater urgency .
Berkeley Professor Tad Patzek , who has written many articles that are critical of our present attempts to replace fossil fuels with biofuels , has just published a new article in which he also discusses solutions - " How Can We Outlive Our Way of Life ? "
Many of you know Tad Patzek as the co-author of a number of papers with David Pimentel .
If you are pro corn-ethanol , then you have probably been conditioned to discount everything Professor Patzek writes .
But even if you disagree with his corn ethanol position , there is still a lot to take away from this paper .
Patzek 's conclusion on cellulosic ethanol is the same as my own :
The status of cellulosic ethanol has been exaggerated and over - hyped , and the solution that we really ought to be pursuing is electric .
The abstract of the paper reads :
In this paper I outline the rational , science - based arguments that question current wisdom of replacing fossil plant fuels ( coal , oil and natural gas ) with fresh plant agrofuels .
This 1:1 replacement is absolutely impossible for more than a few years , because of the ways the planet Earth works and maintains life .
After these few years , the denuded Earth will be a different planet , hostile to human life .
I argue that with the current set of objective constraints a continuous stable solution to human life cannot exist in the near - future , unless we all rapidly implement much more limited ways of using the Earth ’s resources , while reducing the global populations of cars , trucks , livestock and , eventually , also humans .
To avoid economic and ecological disasters , I recommend to decrease all automotive fuel use in Europe by up to 6 percent per year in 8 years , while switching to the increasingly rechargeable hybrid and all - electric cars , progressively driven by photovoltaic cells .
The actual schedule of the rate of decrease should also depend on the exigencies of greenhouse gas abatement .
The photovoltaic cell - battery - electric motor system is some 100 times more efficient than major agrofuel systems .
The paper is highly technical , which will turn off many people .
But what I enjoy - and I believe is one of my strengths - is to distill technical information and present it so that it is more readily digestible for the layperson .
My hope is that this essay succeeds in doing that .
The paper was presented at the 20th Round Table on Sustainable Development of Biofuels in Paris , and therefore contains a lot of Europe - specific discussion and recommendations .
The paper covers a lot of ground .
Petroleum depletion is discussed , and the business - as - usual scenario is discarded as simply not possible .
Cellulosic ethanol is covered , with a close examination of the energy efficiency of Iogen 's plant in Ottawa .
This result is then compared to the energy efficiency claims of the six proposed demonstration plants in the U.S.
The last section compares the potential of photovoltaic cells to biofuels for mitigating our depleting fossil fuel reserves .
Summarizing the Paper
Introduction
In the introduction , Professor Patzek states that world production of conventional petroleum peaked in 2006 , and will decline exponentially within a decade .
He suggests that heroic measures such as infill drilling , horizontal wells , and enhanced oil recovery methods can stem the decline initially , but this will lead to a steeper decline rate later on .
He extrapolates the current per capita use of petroleum with the growth of population in the U.S. , and concludes " that the US and the rest of the world soon will be on a head - on collision course . "
He also states that the U.S. currently uses 33 times as much energy in transportation fuels than is required to feed the population .
Background
In this section , Professor Patzek outlines five constraints that impact humanity 's survival , followed by possible solutions given these constraints .
The constraints include exponential population growth , overuse of the earth 's resources , and our current political structure in which " more is better . "
He presents two solutions to our current situation : 1 ) . Go extinct ; or 2 ) .
Fundamentally and abruptly change .
The status quo is not an option , as Patzek believes it will lead to solution ( 1 ) .
I understand that many doubt that ( 2 ) is possible , which is why they believe we are doomed .
Personally , I believe the most likely solution is a combination of the two .
People will go extinct as food and energy become unaffordable ( this is happening even now ) , but there will be pockets of fundamental and abrupt change .
Fast recognition and adaptation - both on a personal and governmental level - are going to be very important .
Patzek examines the impact of fossil fuel usage on population growth , and concludes that of the present world population , " 4.5 billion people owe their existence to the Haber - Bosch ammonia process and the fossil fuel - driven , fundamentally unstable ' green revolution , ' as well as to vaccines and antibiotics . "
He comments that too many in society consider themselves more knowledgeable about energy matters than they really are , and this is why we are n't urgently confronting the problem .
As his 2nd conclusion of the paper , he writes :
Business as usual will lead to a complete and practically immediate crash of the technically advanced societies and , perhaps , all humanity .
This outcome will not be much different from a collapse of an overgrown colony of bacteria on a petri dish when its sugar food runs out and waste products build up .
He concludes this section by pointing out that we have been conditioned to think that technology is almost magic and will solve our problems .
He quoted a biofuels expert who suggested " Biotechnology is not subject to the same laws of chemistry and physics as other technologies .
In biology anything is possible , and the sky is the limit ! ”
Efficiency of Cellulosic Ethanol Refineries
This section was extremely interesting to me .
Real energy efficiencies of cellulosic ethanol plants ( which presently exist only on paper or in demonstration scale ) are hard to come by .
Those 4:1 or 8:1 energy returns that you often see claimed are hypothetical ; nobody in the cellulosic ethanol business has demonstrated anything like this .
Professor Patzek attempts to shed some light on this subject .
In his words :
I start from a “ reverse - engineering ” calculation of energy efficiency of cellulosic ethanol production in an existing Iogen pilot plant , Ottawa , Canada .
I then discuss the inflated energy efficiency claims of five out - of - six recipients of $ 385 millions of DOE grants to develop cellulosic ethanol refineries .
Using published information , Professor Patzek calculated the efficiency of the Iogen plant .
He defined the efficiency ( albeit by an equation that could have been more clear ) as the BTUs of ethanol produced , divided by the theoretical maximum .
His calculated efficiency of the process was 20 % ; input 1 BTU into the process and return 0.2 BTUs , for a net of - 0.8 BTUs .
This calculation is in the same form as Dr. Wang 's gasoline efficiency calculations - the initial BTUs of the feedstock are counted as an input into the process , and then the processing energy is counted against it .
In simple terms , if you take 1 kilogram of wheat straw , add in the distillation energy and take credit for the heating value of the lignin , you have the denominator of the equation .
The numerator is the heating value of the ethanol that was produced from that kilogram of wheat straw .
If you started with 1 BTU of straw , and produced 1 BTU of ethanol , the efficiency is then governed purely by the distillation energy ( essentially the amount of external energy required to drive the process ) .
Of particular note , the equation did take a credit for the lignin , which is always the assumption that cellulosic ethanol proponents use to obtain inflated energy returns .
However , the most significant piece of the calculation for me - and one that Patzek did not call attention to - is that if you look at only the distillation energy ( the 2nd term in the denominator of Eqn 1 ) , it is 55 % greater than the ethanol that is yielded from the distillation .
That means that production of 1 BTU of cellulosic ethanol requires a distillation step that consumes 1.55 BTUs .
The reason for this is one I have stated numerous times .
As Patzek writes " there is ca. 4 % of alcohol in a batch of industrial wheat - straw beer , in contrast to 12 to 16 % of ethanol in corn-ethanol refinery beers . "
I do note that if you take full credit for the heating value of the lignin , it just barely satisifies the distillation requirement .
If you run through the math , the lignin BTU credit gives an energy balance of 1.05 , which is worse than the 1.3 of corn ethanol plus by - product credits .
But remember , the lignin in the process is not dry .
It is very wet .
Drying co-products in a corn ethanol plant requires a substantial input of energy .
If lignin is to be used in a cellulosic ethanol plant , it will have to be dried .
Furthermore , even if the lignin is dry , no other energy inputs into the process have been considered ( so this is not a complete energy balance calculation ) .
In other words , if those inputs were all free ( of course trucking the biomass back and forth will require significant energy inputs ) , and the lignin was dry , you would get 1.05 BTUs of cellulosic ethanol out for a lignin input of 1 BTU .
Even presuming that Iogen has made major advances recently , it is not surprising why they have been slow to build a commercial facility ; they know the score .
Patzek concludes :
The Iogen plant in Ottawa , Canada , has operated well below name plate capacity for three years .
Iogen should retain their trade secrets , but in exchange for the significant subsidies from the US and Canadian taxpayers they should tell us what the annual production of alcohols was , how much straw was used , and what the fossil fuel and electricity inputs were .
The ethanol yield coefficient in kg of ethanol per kg straw dmb is key to public assessments of the new technology .
Similar remarks pertain to the Novozymes projects heavily subsidized by the Danes .
Until an existing pilot plant provides real , independently verified data on yield coefficients , mash ethanol concentrations , etc. , all proposed cellulosic ethanol refinery designs are speculation .
Patzek then addresses the six proposed cellulosic ethanol plants that were awarded $ 385 million USD by the US Department of Energy .
For reference , he gives the energy efficiency of Sasol 's coal - to - liquids ( CTL ) process as 42 % , the efficiency of an average oil refinery as 88 % ( and I can verify that this number is spot on ) , and that of an optimized corn ethanol refinery as 37 % .
Figure 1 , from Patzek 's paper , compares the claimed efficiencies of the various cellulosic ventures .
Of the six proposed plants , only Abengoa , reporting 25 % estimated energy efficiency , was close to Patzek 's reverse - engineered efficiency for Iogen .
The other five all claimed energy efficiencies in the 40 - 60 % range .
The most optimistic was Vinod Khosla 's former Kergy ( now Range Fuels ) venture .
See the last section of Cellulosic Ethanol vs. Biomass Gasification for some discussion on Kergy .
This process is actually a gasification process , and as such wo n't have the same sorts of issues that Patzek documented for Iogen .
But I do n't think in an apples - to - apples comparison they can beat a CTL process on efficiency , because it is much easier to handle coal than biomass ( not that I endorse CTL ) .
They are also going to have one problem that the others do n't , and that is the production of significant amounts of various mixed alcohols .
There are theoretical reasons why cellulose is unlikely to produce an ethanol concentration in the range of corn ethanol .
Patzek writes that at " about 0.2 to 0.25 kg of straw / L , the mash is barely pumpable " , and states that this straw concentration will result in a fermentation beer of 4.4 % ethanol at a maximum .
Yet five of the proposed plants are claiming energy efficiencies that are as great or greater than those of corn ethanol plants .
Where Will the Agrofuel Biomass Come From ?
In this section , Patzek tackles an issue that I have also addressed :
Where could we get that much biomass to begin with ?
Patzek asks and answers : " Where , how much , and for how long will the Earth produce the extra biomass to quench our unending thirst to drive 1 billion cars and trucks ?
The answer to this question is immediate and unequivocal : Nowhere , close to nothing , and for a very short time indeed . " ...
Professor Patzek 's Conclusions
I will let Professor Patzek 's conclusions speak for themselves .
Here are some excerpts :
In this paper I have painted a radical vision of a world in which fossil fuels and agrofuels will be used increasingly less in transportation vehicles .
Gradually , these fuels will be replaced by electricity stored in the vehicle batteries .
With time the batteries will get better , and electric motors will take over powering the vehicles .
The sources of electricity for the batteries will be increasingly solar photovoltaic cells and wind turbines .
The vagaries of cloudy skies and irregular winds will be alleviated to a large degree by the surplus batteries being recharged and shared locally , with no transmission lines out of a neighborhood or city .
I have shown that even mediocre solar cells that cost 1/3 of their life - time electricity production to be manufactured are at least 100 times more efficient than the current major agrofuel systems .
When deployed these cells will not burn forests ; kill living things on land , in the air , and in the oceans ; erode soil ; contaminate water ; and emit astronomic quantities of greenhouse gases .
Finally , no future transportation system will allow complete “ freedom of personal transportation ” for everyone .
I suggest that good public transportation systems will free many , if not most people from personal transportation .
My Conclusions
I am not sure whether Professor Patzek believes that biofuels have no place at all among our future energy options .
In my opinion , there is a place for them , albeit in niche applications and not as a major energy source .
I think we will continue to have a need for some long - range transportation options ( e.g. , shipping , airline transportation ) that would be difficult to electrify .
But for the most part , the future has to be electric .
The sooner we shift focus from biofuels to electric transportation , the better .
As someone who has debated Tad Patzek , I think his views about biofuels are less important than the remarkably pessimistic view he has of humanity ’s future that results from his methodology .
He and his mentor and sometime co-author David Pimentel seem to believe that the planet ’s human population has long since overshot its carrying capacity and that renewable energy can play only a minor role in meeting our energy needs .
This is where the debate should take place , not about the application of his thermodynamic methodology to what all but Vinod Khosla thinks will be a tiny slice of our energy future .

Jean Laherrere of ASPO
France last year presented a paper entitled " Uncertainty on data and forecasts " .
A TOD commenter grabbed the following figures from Pp.58 and 59 :
I finally put two and two together and realized that the NGL portion of the data really had little to do with typical crude oil discoveries , which only occasionally coincides with natural gas findings .
Khebab has duly noted this as he always references the Shock Oil model with the caption " Crude Oil + NGL " .
Taking the hint , I refit the shock model to better represent the lower peak of crude - only production data .
This essentially scales back the peak by about 10 % as shown in the second figure above .
So I restarted with the assumption that the discoveries comprised only crude oil , and any NGL would come from separate natural gas discoveries .
This meant that that I could use the same discovery model on discovery data , but needed to reduce the overcompensation on extraction rate to remove the " phantom " NGL production that crept into the oil shock production profile .
This essentially will defer the peak because of the decreased extractive force on the discovered reserves .
I fit the discovery plot by Laherrere to the dispersive discovery model with a cumulative limit of 2800 GB and a cubic - quadratic rate of 0.01 .
This gives the blue line in the following figure .
... I still find it endlessly fascinating how the peak position of the models do not show the huge sensitivity to changes that one would expect with the large differences in the underlying URR .
When it comes down to it , shifts of a few years do n't mean much in the greater scheme of things .
However , how we conserve and transition on the backside will make all the difference in the world .
Acciona 's financing of Nevada Solar One , and a recent series of a financing , a prominent hire , and a big announcement from Concentrating Linear Fresnel Reflector ( CLFR ) developer Ausra has been keeping long - underappreciated Concentrating Solar Power ( CSP ) technology in the news recently .
I consider this great news , because the potential for cheap thermal storage of CSP and the gigantic size of the available resource means that CSP is likely to provide the backbone of reliability for any future decarbonized electric grid [ Word Doc ] where the clear skies which it requires to operate properly and sufficient transmission are available .
But CSP is only one of a broad range of Solar technologies , and here I will outline the framework which helps me understand and predict which ones are likely to be most successful .
To understand the future of any technology , you first need to understand its applications , which will lead to an understanding of the characteristics necessary to meet them .
Broadly , solar power is used to produce heat for climate control and process heat , and for electricity , both on the grid and off .
Daylighting
The oldest solar application is daylighting , the use of windows and other means allowing indirect sunlight to provide effective internal illumination inside buildings .
For individual homes , window and skylights are usually sufficient for the job , but there also exist architectural features such as light shelves and even active sun tracking systems which combine with fiber optics or mirrors [ pdf ] to provide light to the interior of large buildings .
Such systems can provide significant energy and maintenance cost savings , as well as increase worker productivity .
They are particularly popular in schools because of studies which show enhanced student learning under natural light .
Thermal Applications
Solar thermal , when used for space heating is needed mostly in the winter in cold and temperate climates .
Because of the fact that it is only useful for part of the year , it needs to be simple and inexpensive to be practical .
Here , passive solar design and proper orientation of buildings is the hands down winner , because passive solar measures are inexpensive to free , with one of the most expensive steps being adding extra thermal mass , something which greatly enhances performance where daily temperature swings are large , and tends to remain fairly inexpensive given its low tech nature .
Passive solar design is almost certain to be a long term winner , although it is unlikely to be a big winner for investors because it does not require special products or materials .
Active solar thermal systems are typically too expensive to economically be used for only the part of the year when the heat is necessary , although when the heat from the system can be switched between multiple applications , such as domestic hot water or electricity generation , it can be economic for an active solar thermal system for at least part of a building 's space heating load .
For process heat , which includes solar domestic hot water , as well as heat for industrial processes [ pdf ] , the active solar thermal systems shine because year round usage can make these still relatively inexpensive systems easily economic .
These systems tend to be either flat plate collector systems , which circulate a working fluid under a black heat collector , or evacuated tube systems , which are somewhat more expensive , but can reach higher temperatures because the heat collector is a solid wire , which avoids problems with boiling the working fluid .
Solar parabolic trough systems are also sometimes used in large scale , high temperature industrial applications .
Electricity Generation
With electricity generation , both time and location become important .
Electric transmission is constrained by infrastructure , and and electric storage is often more expensive than the power being stored , leading to large price premiums for power delivered where and when it 's needed most .
The right place
For off - grid applications flat plate photovoltaic ( PV ) panels , which can be either thin - film or the more traditional crystalline silicon with a battery backup tend to be suitable despite the relatively high cost of power because of the scalability , relative simplicity , lack of moving parts , and low maintenance of the systems .
Concentrating photovoltaic ( CPV ) is seldome used in off grid homes to reduce up - front costs , because it tends not to work as well as flat plate collectors when there are clouds , and the need for a solar tracking system adds to maintenance costs which can be especially critical in the remote locations where off grid power is usually needed .
Another form of practical off grid application is small scale power for lighting or equipment in areas where the grid is available but where the savings from avoided wiring make an investment in PV and a battery pack economical .
A common example of this are the now ubiquitous solar garden lights .
Photovoltaic technologies also have an advantage in distributed generation : placing the power source at the point of use .
The main advantage here is in their simplicity ( which allows for low maintenance ) and scalability , allowing the sizing of the power source to fit the need .
For instance , an electric utility might place west - facing PV on a transmission base station which is near capacity during times of peak load , thereby meeting a portion of that load and avoiding an expensive upgrade to the base station .
The right time
Since electricity typically requires expensive batteries for storage , technologies which can have inexpensive , built in storage have a cost advantage over ones that only produce power when the sun is shining .
Most solar electric technologies conveniently produce power on sunny summer afternoons , a time which normally corresponds to peak load in climates where air conditioning drives peak load .
This effect can often be enhanced by orienting the panels towards the west or southwest so that they are producing their greatest output in the afternoon .
This produces intermediate power , which is available when electric demand is high , but is also often available at non peak times , such as during the day in the winter .
Although such power is more valuable than other forms of intermittent power generation , which often have no correlation with the load profile , they also cannot be relied on to be available when needed , and are less valued by utilities which are responsible for providing power whenever customers want it .
Dispatchable power is the most valuable form of generation ( per kWh ) on the electric grid , because the utility can use it only when demand is high and cannot be met with cheaper resources , while utilities also value base load power , which is almost always available and can be relied on at any time .
Since the sun is not always shining , these forms of power require some form of storage , and this means that they are best met with Concentrating Solar Power , which can be built with thermal storage , a much less expensive way to store power than batteries and other forms of electric storage ( with the possible exception of Pumped Hydro , which is limited in its available capacity and location . )
Thin film vs. CPV
The incumbent photovoltaic technology , crystalline silicon is typically very expensive per watt , and there are two approaches currently being taken to cut costs : thin film and concentrating PV .
Thin film is another form of flat plate PV that requires much less and less specialized materials but typically has lower conversion efficiencies and durability than crystalline PV , which makes it inappropriate for applications that require a large amount of power generation in a small area , while concentrating photovoltaic ( CPV ) uses lenses or mirrors in to focus sunlight on small but very high efficiency cells to generate power at a lower cost .
CPV usually requires the ability to track the sun and few clouds , which means that it is unlikely to be as economic in distributed applications , although some companies are working to overcome these limitations .
Central Power Generation
For central power generation , the main factor in choosing between technologies is cost .
Here , the concentrating technologies ( CSP and Concentrating PV ) tend to have the advantage , and the ability to use transmission to bring the power to the point of use means that the generation can be placed in areas with a lot of sun and very few clouds where these technologies perform best .
The need for additional maintenance for solar trackers is less of an issue at a central solar plant , and this also give and advantage to the concentrating technologies .
Concentrating Parabolic Trough plants , Solar Tower , and Concentrating Linear Fresnel Reflector generators need large scale ( in the hundreds of megawatts ) to achieve their superior economics , while Dish Stirling and Concentrating photovoltaic ( CPV ) technologies achieve their economies of scale at less than a megawatt .
The superior scalability of Dish Stirling and CPV is largely negated by the cheap thermal storage ( referenced earlier ) available with the first three technologies which is not available with Dish Stirling or CPV .
Conclusions
Whenever a company announces a new technology with higher efficiency , lower cost , or better storage , it 's easy to get carried away and think that that one technology is destined to win out over all the others .
I hope you now appreciate that there are as many or more applications as there are technologies , and which technology has the upper hand will depend on the intended use .
When evaluating companies , it 's most important to consider the target market , and compare the technology to its true competitors .
This article and the following tables should provide a useful cheat - sheet when you do so .

It 's been a while since we 've looked at the state of the electric vehicle market .
Everyone has heard of Tesla , but what else is coming down the road ?
And what 's out there already ?
Last year in Worldchanging , Joel Makower wrote a roundup mentioning the Wrightspeed and Tesla vehicles -- but there are also practical utility vehicles , neighborhood vehicles , and more from the likes of Phoenix Motors , Javlon Electric , and Zap .
Plus , the first commercially available solar - powered cars by Venturi , and other fun toys .
The Venturi Fetish
Sports Cars
VenturiFetish.jpgVenturi
Motors , in Monaco , would like to make it very clear that it did the electric roadster before Tesla did -- Venturi's Fetish vehicle spent two years on a round - the - world tour before going into production , and has been on sale for a couple years now .
It also costs four times what the Tesla does .
The Wrightspeed X1 roadster ( almost dragster ) is still just a prototype at this point , but founder Ian Wright is trying to raise money to make a production car that would have more impressive performance than any other commercial EV roadster : 0 - 60 mph in 3 seconds at 170 mpg equivalent .
Tesla has delayed its first run of shipping vehicles , but the company is promising vehicles will hit the road by Q1 of 2008 .
Zap , perhaps the longest - lived electric vehicle company , which has eked out an existence since 1994 , claims to have a sports car in the works as well .
Zap 's Zap - X is being developed with help from Lotus Engineering ( note that Lotus was the company that designed the Tesla 's body , though the Zap - X's styling does n't have the same sex appeal ) .
The list of features is long enough and impressive enough to be implausible , so I would n't hold your breath on this one , but I 'll be delighted if it does come out with everything advertised : photovoltaic glass , a 10 - minute recharge time , 155 mph top speed , an onboard computer with HD video , iPod , bluetooth , Firewire , and USB ports .
All for just $ 25 K .
Phoenix Motors 's truck and the Corbin Sparrow , now Myers Motors NmG
Practical Cars
Phoenix_n_Sparrow.jpgPhoenix
Motorcars sells electric trucks and SUVs , mostly to companies that run fleets of vehicles .
Phoenix 's vehicles go full freeway speeds , have good battery ranges , and can carry cargo .
AutoBlogGreen says the company 's cars have unique batteries with an amazing lifetime :
Recently , the company conducted an in - house test on their NanoSafe batteries and found that after 15,000 ( not a typo ) deep charge and discharge cycles , the product retained over 85 percent of its charge capacity .
In theory that would push the life of these batteries beyond 40 years if you recharged everyday , though , the company admits that under real - world wear and tear a battery life of 20 years is more realistic .
That 's easily four times the life of most current EV batteries .
Miles Automotive Group has a number of cars which , despite golf cart speeds , have real car size and style .
Here 's a pretty interesting video interview with the company , about the Javlon model .
ZENN is the name of both the car and the company for a Toronto - based neighborhood EV maker .
Another slow speed but full size car , this won the Michelin Bibendum Challenge 's Top Urban Vehicle award in 2006 .
Venturi's Eclectic is a neighborhood vehicle which has such a futurismo design that you can't call it a golf cart .
Its ' claim to fame is the ability to generate its ' own power , from the solar panels on the roof as well as a wind turbine that comes attached .
( And no , you can't power it on the wind generated by driving the car ; it 's not a perpetual motion machine . )
Sexier than that , though , is the Venturi Astrolab , a two - seater solar car featured at this past month 's Wired NextFest in Los Angeles .
For urbanites , a truly practical car is a mini-car .
Zap does have a number of real neighborhood mini-cars on the road with top speeds around 40 mph , and they 're pretty cute : check out the Xebra sedan , for instance .
Indian - made Reva is supposedly the best selling EV in the world .
Another micro-car , it has a top speed of around 50 mph , can fit four snugly , and has boxy - but cute styling that reminds me of plastic toy dinosaurs .
( It 's imported into the United Kingdom under the name G - Wiz . )
My favorite micro-car is the Myers Motors NmG -- formerly the Corbin Sparrow .
Just a one - seater , as small as a fat motorcycle with room for a couple bags of groceries in the back , it is the ultimate commuter vehicle : not limited to neighborhood streets , it can go 75 mph on the freeway .
And it 's the cutest car ever .
The Tango is an impressively engineered micro-car .
Like the NmG , it 's about half the width of a normal car , but it can carry a passenger and go a startling 130 mph , accelerating off the line almost as fast as the roadsters mentioned above .
It 's not pretty -- actually it 's miserably boxy - looking -- but it 's both fast and safe .
Not in production yet , the Tango has been around for a few years , gathering advance - order deposits to demonstrate to investors that the market demand is there .

Irish scientists have isolated a bacterium that can convert a toxic waste product into safe , biodegradable plastic .
This week , scientists Kevin O'Connor and Patrick Ward , of the Department of Industrial Microbiology at University College Dublin , announced that they have discovered a bacterial strain that uses styrene , a toxic byproduct of the polystyrene industry ( which produces Styrofoam , among other things ) , as fuel to make a type of biodegradable plastic , polyhydroxyalkanoate , known as PHA .
Bacteria can live and grow pretty much anywhere , from boiling springs to deep sea , solid rock to stomach acid .
Their versatility is at the heart of countless past successes of the biotech industry as well as current efforts , including several by scientists striving to develop toxin - reducing strains such as oil - eating bacteria .
But O'Connor and Ward 's bacteria go a step further and produce a useful end product .
" Our bacteria detoxify styrene and return it to us as a green plastic , " said O'Connor .
Styrene is found in many types of industrial effluent , and in the United States alone it accounts for 55 million pounds of hazardous waste every year .
It causes lung irritation and muscle weakness , and affects the brain and nervous system in people and animals .
Up to 90,000 workers in the polystyrene industry are potentially exposed to styrene , so a method of disposing of it safely would have health , as well as economic , benefits .
" The current methods of dealing with waste styrene include underground injection , spreading it on land or burning it in incinerators to generate energy , which results in toxic emissions , " said Ward .
" We all use plastics in our everyday lives , from disposable drinking cups to car parts , so millions of tons are made , used and discarded every year .
But the slow rate of degradation of polystyrene means that it can last thousands of years in our environment . "
To tackle the problem , the Irish scientists turned to a species of bacterium , Pseudomonas putida , that occurs naturally in soil and can live on styrene .
They grew it in a bioreactor with styrene as the sole source of carbon and energy .
Their efforts resulted in the isolation of the styrene - eating Pseudomonas putida strain CA - 3 , which converts styrene into the plastic polymer PHA as a stored energy source .

The Energy Blog reports that Poet Biorefining has become the largest ethanol producer in the world , and may be first to produce cellulosic ethanol using technology from DuPont and Novozymes .
I think its worthwhile keeping the Seven Commandments of Biofuel in mind whenever evaluating these kinds of schemes .
Robert Rapier has been a critic of ethanol and other biofuels in their various forms for some time .
His latest post takes a look at Ted Patzek 's new paper on biofuels - " Review : How Can We Outlive Our Way of Life ? " . I should note I 'm very dubious about the prophets of overshoot like Patzek and David Pimental - however , while I remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for some types of biofuel production replacing a portion of our current oil consumption , I am in complete agreement with the conclusion that we need to move to an electric transport system and fuel it with renewable energy sources - primarily solar ( along with wind , ocean and geothermal ) energy .
As long time readers know , I 'm rather less enthralled by his thoughts about population levels .
Commenter David Morris adds some further cautionary words I 'd also note that I consider the idea that you can't replace existing energy sources with 100 % renewable equivalents ridiculous .

Ms Rice is making her seventh trip to the region this year
Condoleezza
Rice said reaching a two - state solution was a priority for her and US President George Bush .
Ms Rice was speaking from the West Bank , where she has been trying to get agreement for a peace summit in the US .
Meanwhile the Israeli PM has hinted he may consider giving up Palestinian districts in Jerusalem in a peace deal .
Ehud Olmert told parliament " legitimate questions " could be asked about the Israeli annexing of outlying Palestinian neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem following the 1967 war .
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state of Palestine , and the issue is one of the most sensitive and intractable of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
' It is time '
" Frankly it is time for the establishment of a Palestinian state , " Ms Rice told reporters in a news conference which she held with the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas .
Every time I visit , the situation seems to have worsened
John Dugard ,
UN special rapporteur
Quartet 's ' deaf ears '
She said the US regarded a two - state solution " as absolutely essential for the future , not just of Palestinians and Israelis but also for the Middle East and indeed for American interests " .
She said Mr Bush would make finding a resolution a top priority of his time in office , and that she would devote her " last ounce of energy " to the issue .
Ms Rice said she wanted agreement on the peace summit , set to be held in Annapolis , Maryland - but that it would have to be " a serious and substantive conference that will advance the cause of a Palestinian state .
" We frankly have better things to do than invite people to Annapolis for a photo op , " said Ms Rice .
The Palestinians have warned that if no tightly - worded text is agreed on which to base talks , they will not attend .
The Israelis say they do not believe an agreed text is necessary .
Despite Ms Rice 's assertion that the current diplomacy represented " the most serious effort to end this conflict in many , many years " , the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Ramallah cautions that huge differences remain between the two sides .
Ms Rice will now meet other regional leaders .
She will need to convince them , too , that a peace conference will be worth turning up for , says our correspondent .
Difficult negotiations
At the same news conference , Mr Abbas said Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were working together .
" We are working on a joint document with the Israeli side .
The document will set out the basis of the solutions to the final status issues : Jerusalem , borders , settlements , refugees , security , water and bilateral relations , " he said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Is the Mid-East Quartet failing Palestinians ?
No , it has failed them - years ago

The Palestinians want detailed agreement and a timetable for the implementation of solutions to some of the key disputes , while the Israelis want a broader , more general document with no timetable .
The disagreement has threatened to derail the conference entirely .
But on Monday , Mr Olmert appeared to suggest he might be open to compromise on one of the thorniest issues - the status of Jerusalem .
He questioned the logic of a decision to include Palestinian areas within the city 's expanded boundaries after Israel captured them in the 1967 Middle East war .
" Was it necessary to annex the Shufat refugee camp , al - Sawahra , Walajeh and other villages and state that this is also Jerusalem ? "
Mr Olmert asked in a speech to the Knesset .
" I must admit , one can ask some legitimate questions on the issue , " he told parliament .

Sure , everyone knows that the Hamburger comes from Hamburg and the frankfurter comes from Frankfurt .
What could be plainer ?
But it may interest you to know that while the meats themselves are German in origin , the idea of placing a Hamburger or a frankfurter in a bun is an American innovation and institution .
The fact is those countries that do regularly consume the frank and the Hamburger are more likely to import them from the United States than Germany !
The Hamburger is a more recent invention than the frankfurter .
During the middle ages , traveling merchants from Hamburg learnt from the Tartars of the Baltic lands how to scrape raw meat and season it with salt , pepper , and onion juice for what came to be known as “ Tartar Steak ” .
Many restaurants still serve a similar dish known as “ steak tartare ” .
No one knows the name of the first cook to shape scraped or chopped beef into a patty and broil it , but we do know that the first Hamburgers were browned on the outside and almost raw inside .
When the Hamburger arrived in America , it was eaten quite raw , the way the French , for instance , still prefer their meat .
The English and Irish were the first to cook their beef patties well done throughout .
The English called the burger Salisbury Steak after Dr. James H. Salisbury , who in the 1880s recommended to his patients that they eat well done beef patties three times daily , with hot water before and after , to relieve colitis , anemia , and other ailments .
Modern doctors might scoff at Salisbury ’s ideas .
But you ’ll find Salisbury Steak on many dinner menus side by side with the Hamburger .
The difference ?
Well , many diners buy their chopped meat frozen in large plastic bags .
To prepare Hamburger patties , an implement such as ice cream scoop is used to extract thawed meat from the bag and set it on pieces of wax paper .
The chef then forms the patties by swatting the lumps of chopped meat with a heavy can of vegetables , round of course .
For the Salisbury Steak , however , an oval can ( usually a sardine can ) is used to shape the meat .
Burgers were first popularized in the US by German immigrants settling around Cincinnati .
But the first Hamburger was n’t laid between the halves of a bun until early this century .
The sandwich , meat of any kind between pieces of bread , has been with us since the eighteenth century .
The sandwich was reputedly the brainstorm of inveterate gambler John Montagu , fourth earl of Sandwich , who stuffed his meat between bread slices so that he could dine at the gambling table .
Officially , the first Hamburger sandwich appeared at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis , Missouri , also the birthplace of the ice cream cone .
As for the modern Hamburger , the last decade has seen a huge increase in burger corruption , with Soy protein being a common culprit .
But consider yourself lucky .
A Welsh zoologist has been working on a high - protein burger made from rat meat .
And other scientists with tainted tastebuds have proposed a Hamburger made from cotton .
Talk about flannel mouth .
If the popularity of the frankfurter has tapered off somewhat in recent years , the Hamburger is certainly on the rise .
Chopped meat now accounts for about 30 percent of all consumer meat sales .
As late in the 1920s , many American dictionaries still did not have the word Hamburger , though most did mention the Hamburger steak .
Today , it would be indeed hard to find a restaurant , diner , coffee shop , or road side stand that did not serve the Hamburger in some shape or form .
Burger joints have been mushrooming all over Europe too , led by a British chain known as Wimpy ’s .
And you ’ll have no trouble in Paris finding a McDonald ’s for “ Le Cheeseburger ” .
McDonald ’s is a story in itself .
A chain known as White Castle was the first to serve cheap , mass produced Hamburgers .
Since then , Hamburger joints have proliferated .
Today , McDonald ’s is definitely the leader of the pack .
Beginning with a stand in Des Plaines , Illinois , which raised its now famous yellow beams on April 15 , 1955 , McDonald ’s has grown into a huge corporation with well over several billion dollars in annual sales .
McDonald ’s sales average a billion Hamburgers every year .
To date , McDonald ’s has sold over 100 billion Hamburgers .
Stack them up , and you ’d have 100 piles the height of the tallest buildings in the world .
The McDonald ’s Corporation is run from a complex near Chicago called “ Hamburger Central ” .
Since 1968 , new franchisers have been taught the ABC’s of hamburgerology at a school in Elk Grove Village , Illinois , known at Hamburger University .
The McDonald ’s philosophy in the 1970s , in 3 out of 4 families , it ’s the children who decide where to eat .
Please the child , and you ’ve captured the entire family .
That idea has certainly worked .
The McDonald ’s burger has not only spread from coast to coast in the US , it has multiplied globally .
As of 2007 , there were more than 31,000 McDonald ’s restaurants throughout the world .
And yes , there ’s a McDonald ’s in Hamburg .
If the McDonald ’s burger has lost little in translation , some of the firm ’s terminology has not fared so well .
When McDonald ’s was laying plans for its first Paris franchise , “ Gros Mec ” seemed the appropriate translation for the Big Mac , until red- faced McDonald ’s officials learned that “ Gros Mec ” also meant “ big pimp ” to the Frenchman .
McDonald ’s may hold the record for the number of Hamburgers sold , but certainly not for the largest burger .
That honor belongs to a group of Australians who in 1975 exhibited a 2,859 pound Hamburger which was over 17 feet in circumference .
Hopefully , they had a few tons of catsup on hand .
" For many they are a blight on the American landscape .
For others , they are an expression of freedom and success .
Now legislators in cities across the US , alarmed at the spread of " McMansions " , are trying to contain the size of American homes .
Inspired by concerns that communities are disappearing and alarmed by the environmental costs , planners have drawn up measures to ensure new homes stay within a footprint that is proportionate to the plot size .
Since 1973 the median size of a new home in the US has grown from 1,525 sq ft ( 142 sq metres ) to 2,248 sq ft .
At the same time , the number of people per household has fallen from 3.1 to 2.6 .
Huge mansions are a common site across the US , dotting the landscape alongside motorways in Colorado , or squeezed into tiny plots in urban areas .
But the trend has alarmed planners and conservationists .
In Boulder County , Colorado , which has recently adopted measures to cap the size of new homes , houses have grown from an average of 3,900 sq ft in 1990 to 6,300 sq ft last year .
Last month in Los Angeles , the city 's planning commission passed a motion to restrict the size of new homes .
If the city council adopts the measure it could affect 300,000 properties in the city .
Similar measures have been adopted in Minneapolis and in Florida . "
Si le web 2.0 a été le buzzword de l’année 2006 , on commence de plus en plus à entendre parler d’Entreprise 2.0 .
Pour faire court , il s’agit d’utiliser dans le monde de l’entreprise les outils qui ont fait le succès du web 2.0 .
N’allez surtout pas vous imaginer que cela se résume à lancer un blog et un wiki interne , cette notion recoupe en fait des pratiques bien plus riches que des simples blogs et surtout engendre des mutations qui vont au - delà de la mise en ligne de nouveaux outils .
Avant de vous livrer un schéma récapitulatif qui risque de vous perturber , je vous propose dans un premier temps de débroussailler le sujet .
Quelques définitions et articles fondateurs ( et après on n’en parle plus )
Commençons par une définition très académique qui nous vient du professeur Andrew McAfee : « L’entreprise 2.0 correspond à une utilisation de plateformes sociales émergentes au sein de sociétés ou entre des sociétés , leurs partenaires et leurs clients « .
Une définition qui a le mérite d’être courte , mais pas plus courte que celle d’Indus Khaitan : « Enterprise 2.0 = Writable Intranet « .
Si vous souhaitez quelque chose de plus long , je vous recommande cet article : Enterprise 2.0 , The Big Picture .
Nous pouvons compléter cette définition avec l’acronyme SLATES qui liste les composantes essentielles de la collaboration : Search , Links , Authoring , Tags , Extensions et Signals .
Nous pouvons également citer les notions d’Enterprise Social Software et ses 7 principes fondateurs .
Il y a aussi ce diaporama ( Meet Charlie ) qui est intéressant mais qui se contente de survoler le sujet .
Je vous propose enfin cette petite sélection d’articles pour enrichir vos favoris :
Maintenant que vous avez à votre disposition un premier fond documentaire , il est temps de simplifier tout ça et de poser quelques notions de base .
C’est tout ( quoi que pas tout à fait ) sauf une question de technologie
Tout comme la révolution du web 2.0 ne repose pas sur des innovations technologiques ( mais y est néanmoins indirectement liée ) , l’Entreprise 2.0 regroupe un certain nombre de nouvelles pratiques de collaboration qui ne nécessitent pas d’aménagement dans votre système d’information .
Correction : qui ne nécessitent à priori pas d’aménagement .
Car autant il est très simple de greffer un blog ou un wiki à un intranet , autant les véritables bénéfices de l’Entreprise 2.0 ne se feront ressentir qu’après avoir déployé une nouvelle architecture logicielle de votre SI .
Comprenez par là qu’il n’y aura pas de révolution dans les méthodes et outils de travail sans révolution informatique .
D’ailleurs ce n’est pas un hasard si dans sa première définition le professeur Andrew McAfee faisait référence aux architectures orientées services : Enterprise 2.0 vs. SOA .
La bonne nouvelle , c’est qu’une entreprise n’acquiert pas du jour au lendemain sont statut « 2.0 » .
C’est un processus long et progressif dont les premières étapes n’ont quasiment aucun impact sur le SI .
Par contre , une fois les pratiques de collaboration de base ( blog et wiki ) assimilées par les employés , les grands travaux peuvent alors commencer pour adopter progressivement un SI plus flexible avec une forte modularité qui permet de mettre les employés au cœur des processus et de personnaliser la connaissance et les outils en fonction du contexte quotidien .
Le professeur Andrew McAfee ( encore lui !) est d’ailleurs on ne peut plus clair à ce sujet :
It ’s Not Not About the Technology , et il n’est pas le seul : Enterprise 2.0 = Next Generation IT .
Bien évidement ne vous imaginez pas non plus qu’il est possible de se passer d’une structure informatique « locale » et de tout sous - traiter à des fournisseurs de services en ligne .
Dans la plupart des cas , l’adoption de solutions dites d’ » Entreprise 2 .0 » ne met pas les informaticiens au chômage , bien au contraire : Does Enterprise 2.0 actually mean a bigger IT Department ?
L’idée n’est pas de diminuer la dépendance aux outils informatiques , mais plutôt d’en décloisonner les usages .
C’est mon fichier , c’est moi qui décide !
Qu’on se le dise , l’Entreprise 2.0 c’est avant tout l’école du partage et de la collaboration .
Lancer un blog , un wiki ou un espace de travail en ligne sans s’assurer de l’adhésion des collaborateurs est une perte de temps et d’argent .
La plus grosse erreur serait de sous - estimer le poids des habitudes et surtout la résistance au changement .
L’information ( la bonne , la vraie ) est en effet une denrée rare que les collaborateurs s’arrachent : ils la stockent dans un fichier qui est jalousement protégé par un mot de passe , une arborescence complexe et un répertoire non-partagé .
Travailler en mode « wiki » , délivrer son expérience et son savoir - faire sur un blog sont des pratiques qui vont à l’encontre de ce que l’on apprend sur le terrain ; à savoir : se débrouiller pour apparaitre comme indispensable au bon fonctionnement de l’entreprise auprès de ses supérieurs .
C’était jusque là le meilleur moyen de progresser dans la hiérarchie ( en attendant que des places se libèrent au dessus ) et de toucher sa prime de fin d’année .
Oui mais voilà , les temps changent : les chinois sont maintenant capables de confectionner des produits similaires aux nôtres pour 1/10 ème du prix et les indiens des services similaires pour 1 / 5 ème du prix .
Et le pire , c’est que nous n’en sommes qu’au début des complications puisque ces pays sont eux - mêmes menacés par de la main d’œuvre encore moins cher ( les philippins faisant concurrence aux chinois et les sri-lankais aux indiens ) .
Moralité : pour rester compétitif , il va falloir modifier nos habitudes , méthodes et outils de travail .
Le but de la manœuvre étant de faire circuler plus vite la bonne information à la bonne personne , les américains appellent ça la business - critical information .
Entreprise 2.0 = Collaborateurs 2.0 = RH 2.0
Je sais ce que vous allez me dire : on ne peut pas changer tout seul , il faut que les autres changent avec nous .
Et je suis bien d’accord avec vous !
En plus des impacts sur les méthodes et outils de travail , l’Entreprise 2.0 nécessite également de revoir entièrement la gestion des carrières et les modèles d’évaluation des collaborateurs .
Les critères qualitatifs existent depuis de nombreuses années dans le monde de l’entreprise , et il serait très tentant ( et dangereux ) de vouloir faire du qualitatif avec du quantitatif .
Exemple : fixer des objectifs de volume ( 10 billets à publier par mois ) .
Le plus gros défi à relever pour un collaborateur n’est pas de trouver de l’information ( car elle est là quelque part ) , mais plutôt de trouver la bonne information et en un minimum de temps .
Le spectre de l’infobésité est en effet très présent en entreprise et ceux qui produisent de l’information ne sont pas forcément les plus utiles .
Il existe en effet une catégorie de collaborateurs qui ne produisent rien mais qui organisent , notent , commentent , filtrent … le tout au bénéfice de l’ensemble des autres employés .
Comprenez par là que cette fonction de « filtre humain » est tout aussi importante que celle de rédacteur .
Il en va de même pour les habitués des réunions de couloir et des salles fumeurs : ils discutent , rencontrent , font se rencontrer , colportent , relayent … bref ils facilitent l’interaction sociale entre les employés .
Même s’ils n’apparaissent pas comme essentiels aux yeux des patrons , ils jouent un rôle très important dans la structure sociale et dans les échanges informels .
Les spécialistes des réseaux sociaux les appellent des nœuds forts .
Dans un principe d’équité , il devient alors indispensable de pouvoir évaluer et valoriser l’importance d’un collaborateur en fonction de ses rôles / actions formelles et informelles .
Dans une entreprise où tout est partagé avec tout le monde , ce n’est pas une mince affaire , mais c’est loin d’être impossible .
Vue d’ensemble de l’Entreprise 2.0
Je vous propose maintenant de décortiquer les différentes composantes de l’Entreprise 2.0 en s’appuyant sur le schéma récapitulatif suivant :
Oui je sais , ça fait beaucoup de flèches , mais c’est parce que dans le modèle « Entreprise 2.0 » ce sont les collaborateurs qui sont au centre et les informations / outils qui gravitent autour .
Vous pouvez aussi aller voir la version originale sur FlickR ou télécharger ce schéma au format PDF .
Tout d’abord , l ’essentiel de l’activité d’un collaborateur devrait pouvoir se faire en ligne ( sur l’intranet ou avec des accès sécurisés quand il est en déplacement ou en télétravail ) .
Le portail d’entreprise endosse alors une très grosse responsabilité car il est l’épine dorsale sur laquelle repose un certain nombre de briques essentielles :
Le tableau de bord qui sert à concentrer l’attention des collaborateurs sur un écran unique d’où il pourra accéder à l’ensemble des informations , services et applications qui lui sont utiles au quotidien ( sous forme d’indicateurs , de raccourcis ou d’alertes ) .
C’est en quelque sorte un Netvibes d’entreprise ( ou un Portaneo qui est un équivalent open source ) ;

C’est en quelque sorte un Netvibes d’entreprise ( ou un Portaneo qui est un équivalent open source ) ;
Le profil du collaborateur qui va lui permettre de contextualiser et de personnaliser l’information mais également l’accès aux différents services .
Ce profil sera également le point de départ ( et d’arrivée ) de l’ensemble de l’activité sociale du collaborateur ( quelque chose à mi-chemin entre Facebook et LinkedIn ) ;

Ce profil sera également le point de départ ( et d’arrivée ) de l’ensemble de l’activité sociale du collaborateur ( quelque chose à mi-chemin entre Facebook et LinkedIn ) ;
Le mécanisme d’ authentification qui va lui permettre d’avoir un accès complet ou restreint aux applications internes , partagées ou externes ( l’équivalent d’un OpenID mais en plus robuste ) ;
qui va lui permettre d’avoir un accès complet ou restreint aux applications internes , partagées ou externes ( l’équivalent d’un OpenID mais en plus robuste ) ;
Les filtres seront particulièrement utiles pour ne pas le noyer sous une masse d’information .
Ils pourront être individuels ( en fonction de critères définis par le collaborateur ) ou collaboratifs ( en fonction de critères et paramètres communs à un groupe d’utilisateurs ciblés ) ;

Ils pourront être individuels ( en fonction de critères définis par le collaborateur ) ou collaboratifs ( en fonction de critères et paramètres communs à un groupe d’utilisateurs ciblés ) ;
Le moteur de recherche sera enfin un outil essentiel pour pouvoir accéder à la fameuse business - critical information .
Ce moteur pourra être sémantique ( fonctionnant à partir d’un thésaurus ) , empirique ( auto - apprenant comme l’index de Google ) ou social ( utilisant de tags et de systèmes de notation ) ; ou pourquoi pas les trois ( comme le propose CoReap ) .
Fermes de blogs et wikis comme alternatives aux fichiers qui s’égarent
Par définition , un fichier ça s’égare , ça ne tient pas forcément dans la limite imposée par votre boîte email , ça encombre les serveurs … bref c’est un outil qui date d’une autre époque , celle des années 90 où Microsoft et sa suite Office étaient vues comme des accélérateurs de business .
Aujourd ’hui la réalité est tout autre : nous rédigeons sous Powerpoint , faisons des tableaux dans
Word et des schémas dans Excel .
Bref , il est temps que ça change et c’est là où les blogs et wikis entrent en scène .
Les blogs tout d’abord , avec leur moteur de publication très simple qui permet aux contributeurs de commencer à rédiger sans avoir à chercher la notice ou à suivre une formation .
Ces blogs et leurs interfaces intuitives permettent également aux novices de « consommer » l’information avec plus de précision ( système de catégories , d’archives , de mots - clés ) et d’efficacité ( abonnement au flux RSS ) .
Dans certains grands groupes ( IBM , Microsoft , GE … ) les blogs se comptent par milliers et sont regroupés dans des fermes de blogs : horizontales ( par métiers ) , verticales ( par business unit ou pays ) et transversales .
Les blogs sont un moyen très simple d’extraire l’information de systèmes propriétaires ( fichiers , emails … ) et de la partager à grande échelle ( le blog du patron ) ou de façon plus locale ( blog d’une équipe projet composée de quelques personnes ) .
La communication n’en devient alors que plus simple : plus d’emails qui se perdent , plus de réponses enchevêtrées où il manque toujours quelqu ’un en copie , plus de doublons , plus de susceptibilités ( « ce message m’était adressé en priorité , pourquoi ne suis - je qu’en copie ? « ) .
Tout est géré par le moteur du blog : la publication , les commentaires , l’archivage , la catégorisation .
Cerise sur le gâteau : un nouvel entrant dans une équipe peut avoir accès à l’historique des échanges en quelques clics .
La règle d’or : si vous avez plus de 5 personnes en copie d’un email , faites - en plutôt un billet .
Typepad est bien évidement un acteur de choix mais IBM propose aussi son offre .
De plus , les moteurs de blog intègrent tous la possibilité de publier des flux RSS qui sont un pré-requis indispensable à la circulation de l’information : légers , flexibles et universels .
Des sociétés se sont même spécialisées dans la gestion de flux RSS d’entreprise à l’image de KnowNow .
Les blogs externes font également partis de la blogosphère d’une entreprise : les collaborateurs peuvent y souscrire individuellement ou les inscrire au sein de grands bookmarks collectifs .
Ceux - ci peuvent être spécifiques à un métier ou un département .
Cogenz , ConnectBeam et IBM proposent des solutions de ce type .
De même , des portails collaboratifs comme Digg ou Wikio peuvent être mis en œuvre au sein d’un département pour pouvoir filtrer l’information et ne faire ressortir que les articles les plus pertinents ( en fonction des notes ) .
Les wikis sont également l’occasion de se simplifier la vie ( professionnelle ) : plus de conflits de version , plus de d’historique des modifications indéchiffrables , plus d’aller / retour incessants par email , plus de noms de fichiers à la noix ( « cr_reunion_final_fr_V2_Fred_OK_print.doc » ) …
Les wikis sont des applications en ligne qui sont nativement collaboratives : chacun apporte sa petite contribution ( rédaction , compléments , corrections … ) et l’information est toujours à jour .
De plus , l’historisation est automatique , la modération peut se faire à postériori , les droits peuvent être gérés en fonction du profil ( lecture , modification , modération … ) .
Dans le cadre de bases de connaissance verticalisées ( marketing , juridique , S.I …. ) les wikis offrent une alternative très simple aux systèmes de gestion de la connaissance .
Beaucoup moins sophistiquée , certes , mais beaucoup plus simple à mettre en œuvre .
Les champions du wiki d’entreprise sont des fournisseurs comme SocialText , Atlassian ou MindTouch .
Il est important de préciser que les wikis ne s’exploitent pas forcément de manière isolée , ils peuvent être combinés avec d’autres outils pour pouvoir bâtir des Knowledge Ecosystems .
Univers virtuels et micro-blogs comme supports de formation
De nombreux progrès peuvent être fait dans le domaine de la formation en ligne , à commencer par l’utilisation de blogs dans le cadre de micro-formation .
L’idée ici d’éviter déplacement des collaborateurs en un même endroit pendant une journée et de leur délivrer à la place par email ou par flux RSS un petit bout d’une formation ( entre 2 à 5 minutes avec éventuellement un exercice corrigé ) .
Cette pratique permet d’éviter d’immobiliser une salle et une journée de travail pour les collaborateurs .
De plus , elle permet de travailler sur le long terme ( mémoire chimique par opposition à la mémoire électrique ) .
Dans un autre domaine , le v-learning peut également aider à palier aux contraintes logistiques ( déplacements et réservation d’une salle de réunion ) en proposant une alternative très crédible aux conférences téléphoniques : les espaces de collaboration 3D comme peuvent en proposer Tixeo ou I -maginer .
Il est également possible d’exploiter les univers virtuels dans le cadre de simulation ultra-réalistes ( serious games ) pour tester les réactions et comportements des employés face à des situations de crise très difficiles à mettre en œuvre sur un site physique .
C’est ce que proposent des sociétés comme IBM ou Sun avec cette nouvelle itération du théâtre d’entreprise .
Pour en savoir plus , je vous recommande de lire la définition de Wikipedia : Serious Game ; cette simulation de start - up : SpigIt ; ou encore cet article sur des simulations de situations de crise : Emergency Training in Second Life .
Pourquoi ne pas évoquer également le cas de Grockit , une start - up qui propose une solution de v-learning basée sur la collaboration massive , ils appellent ça du MMPOL ( Massive Multi - Player Online Learning ) .
En poussant ce concept un peu plus loin , il serait même possible d’envisager des espaces virtuels où les collaborateurs pourraient suivre de formations , organiser des réunions , partager des expériences professionnelles … au travers d’une interface 3D .
Ces intranets virtuels ( intravers ) sont d’ailleurs en expérimentation comme en témoignent les vidéos de ce billet :
Vers des intravers avec les Virtual Workplaces de Sun et IBM .
Extranet + Collaboration = Collaboranet ?
Toujours dans le domaine de la collaboration , les espaces de travail collaboratifs présentent l’énorme avantage de simplifier le déploiement et la gestion des participants .
Ceux qui ont déjà dû endurer ( subir ? ) MS Project ou Lotus Notes savent de quoi je parle .
Les applications de gestion de projet en ligne comme BaseCamp , ProjectPlace ou ActiveCollab ( un équivalent open source ) ou des extranets applicatifs comme JotSpot ou ClearSpace sont un modèle d’efficacité et d’intuitivité .
Ce type de plateforme collaborative existait déjà dans le monde du logiciel ( avec des services comme CollabNet ) mais peut être adapté à tout type d’activité .
Nous pouvons également citer les plateformes de collaboration qui fonctionnent comme des boîtes à idées collaboratives , c’est la cas de FeedBack 2.0 qui propose une solution de collaboration basée sur des recommandations .
Mashup d’entreprise et applications en ligne viabilisés par les API
Les interfaces riches ont grandement contribué à la remise au goût du jour des applications en ligne .
Que ce soit dans une configuration bureautique ( voir les offres suivantes : Zoho , ThinkFree , Zimbra … ainsi que cet article : Boundary Spanning at Office 2.0 ) ou pour une application plus lourde ( vous connaissez SalesForce ? ) .
Le bénéfice évident de ces solutions est un gain de simplicité ( déploiement , mise à jour , modèle de facturation ) sans pour autant diminuer la richesse ou la productivité .
Dans certains cas de figure , les applications en ligne permettent même de faciliter l’intégration et de faire du SOA en version light : Extending SalesForce.com and SOA with rich internet applications .
En ouvrant des API pour ces applications , leur intérêt s’en retrouve par contre démultiplié en rendant possible l’élaboration de tableaux de bord personnalisés ou de mashups d’entreprise avec des outils comme le proposent DreamFactory ou CogHead ( lire à ce sujet ces très bons articles :
Mashups :
The next major new software development model ?
et A bumper crop of new mashup platforms ) .
Peut - être dans un avenir proche pourrez - vous concevoir votre système d’information personnel à la demande ( c’est le but poursuivi par des plateformes comme AppExchange , SugarExchange , Iceberg … ) ou encore à des systèmes d’information wikifiés ( attendez pour cela de voir ce que va donner la fusion de JotSpot et de Google Apps ) .
En plus de ces applications internes , le système d’authentification peut également vous servir à vous connecter à des applications externes ( places de marché B to B , sites de voyage … ) sans avoir un solliciter un intermédiaire ( juste un serveur d’identité professionnelle ) .
Réseau social d’entreprise et système de coaching social pour favoriser l’intégration
C’est très certainement dans la dimension sociale d’une entreprise que l’on peut réaliser les plus gros progrès .
Les grands groupes ( ou même les PME ) souffrent en effet d’un manque de … gens qui parlent entre eux !
Pour faire court : les mêmes tâches sont réalisées par plusieurs personnes d’une même structure .
C’est là où les réseaux sociaux trouvent leur place : mettre en relation les bonnes personnes , que ce soit pour récupérer une information , pour mutualiser des compétences ou pour monter des équipes .
L’idée n’est pas d’outrepasser la hiérarchie ou le service des RH mais plutôt de fluidifier les échanges ( pour de vrai ! ) .
Les réseaux sociaux B to B ( comme Linked In ) sont intéressants mais ouverts à tous .
A partir du moment où une structure dépasse le millier de collaborateurs , des solutions comme Affinitiz ou VisiblePath prennent tout leur sens .
Ces réseaux sociaux internes reposent sur des profils de collaborateurs extrêmement détaillés qui permettraient de rassembler des collaborateurs par compétences / affinités voir de proposer un principe de coaching d’entreprise : les collaborateurs poursuivant le même objectif ( apprendre le chinois , se perfectionner en informatique … ) se regroupent pour s’entre - aider .
Ce principe existe déjà avec des services comme 43 Things , InpowR ou encore GoalMigo .
Enfin , il serait tout à fait possible dans un second temps d’étendre ce réseau social d’entreprise aux anciens collaborateurs : retraités , stagiaires , prestataires … pour pouvoir rapidement retrouver une compétence ou une information perdue avec un système de prime ( boonty ) comme on en trouve sur les plateformes de crowdsoucing ( du type Innocentive ) .
Micro -blogging et lifelog pour documenter le quotidien
Pour finir , il serait également intéressant d’implémenter des solutions de micro-blogging ( comme Twitter ou Jaiku ) pour pouvoir animer des micro-communautés ( et désengorger la messagerie d’email parasites ) .
Ces services pourraient également servir à « documenter » ( historiser ? ) l’activité quotidienne d’un collaborateur ( en s’inspirant de services comme Plazes par exemple pour suivre les déplacements ) .
En poussant cette idée un peu plus loin , il serait même possible d’implémenter des services comme Slife ou MyLifBits pour éviter aux collaborateurs d’avoir à saisir leurs journées de travail dans des systèmes de time reporting .
Le principe de lifelog d’entreprise est peut - être celui qui vous fera le plus grimacer .
Son côté surveillance au quotidien à de quoi faire peur mais il pourrait s’avérer très utile pour déterminer quel à été l’apport global d’un collaborateur , d’évaluer l’empreinte qu’il a laissée .

Un pour tous et tous pour un
Je me permets d’insister une nouvelle fois sur deux notions essentielles :
Tous ces outils ne servent à rien s’ils ne sont pas adoptés par les collaborateurs .
Comprenez par là que l’impulsion doit venir de la Direction Générale qui va cautionner et encourager les changements nécessaires dans les habitudes et méthodes de travail .
Des expérimentations peuvent être menées dans un premier temps pour tester l’appétence des collaborateurs à ces nouvelles pratiques , mais vous devrez forcément impliquer votre direction pour pouvoir envisager un déploiement plus large .
. Comprenez par là que l’impulsion doit venir de la Direction Générale qui va cautionner et encourager les changements nécessaires dans les habitudes et méthodes de travail .
Des expérimentations peuvent être menées dans un premier temps pour tester l’appétence des collaborateurs à ces nouvelles pratiques , mais vous devrez forcément impliquer votre direction pour pouvoir envisager un déploiement plus large .
L’efficacité de ces outils est décuplée s’ils fonctionnent ensemble .
Essayez d’imaginer la puissance d’un dispositif comme celui décrit dans mon schéma d’ensemble : les collaborateurs se connecteraient tous les matins à leur Netvibes d’entreprise pour surveiller l’actualité , l ’avancement des projets ou encore l’activité dont ils ont la charge ; ils auraient à leur disposition les outils sociaux pour trouver rapidement l’information ou la personne - clé .
Ils pourraient en quelques clics accéder ou déployer l’application en ligne la plus adaptée à leur besoin , à défaut ils la créeraient .
Ce n’est donc pas les outils qui tirent la collaboration , mais plutôt les utilisateurs .
Souvenez - vous que s’il est possible de faire de la très bonne collaboration avec une simple feuille de papier , il est quasi- impossible d’en faire de même avec des collaborateurs récalcitrants ou méfiants ( même avec les meilleurs outils du marché ) .
Quelle solution choisir ?
De nombreux acteurs sont déjà positionnés sur le créneau de l’Entreprise 2.0 :
Il serait très délicat de vous suggérer une solution miracle qui corresponde à toutes les configurations possibles et se conforme à toutes les contraintes .
La meilleure approche est encore d’expérimenter et d’adopter une démarche empirique .
Par où commencer ?
Comme je l’ai précisé plus haut , la mise en œuvre de pratiques dites d' » Entreprise 2.0 » s’accompagne de nombreux bouleversements dans les habitudes de travail .
Il convient donc d’avoir une approche graduelle :
Recenser dans votre organisation des initiatives déjà menée ( sait - on jamais … ) ;
Faites un sondage auprès des collaborateurs pour savoir quels services web 2.0 ils utilisent déjà ( Netvibes , LinkedIn , Wikipedia , blogs … ) ;
Identifiez les collaborateurs - clés qui sont faciles à convaincre et peuvent faire du prosélytisme ( des « champions » de l’Entreprise 2.0 ) ;
Trouvez un service de petite à moyenne taille avec des collaborateurs à l’esprit ouvert et proposez - leur un blog ou un wiki ; Mettez en place des indicateurs de performance ( KPI ) pour pouvoir mesurer l’apport de ces outils ; Soutenez - les au quotidien dans l’utilisation de cet outil ( faites des « piqures de rappel ») ;
Faites - le point avec eux au bout de 2 à 3 mois ( entretiens individuels ou de groupe ) ;
Monter un dossier où vous expliquez le contexte , décrivez la valeur ajoutée ( avec les KPI et des témoignages ) et proposez un déploiement à plus grande échelle à votre direction ; Rédigez une feuille de route où vous lancerez différentes expérimentations en parallèle dans différents services ; Passez votre entretien annuel d’évaluation et touchez votre prime de fin d’année pour avoir « démontré une forte capacité d’innovation et joué un rôle majeur dans la mutation des processus internes et l’enrichissement de la vie sociale de l’entreprise « .
Bien évidemment
Rome ne s’est pas faite en un jour et il serait illusoire de vouloir passer du tout au tout .
Je peux donc vous recommander un certain nombre de lectures pour étoffer votre propos ( The Wisdom of Crowds , Wikinomics ) ou encore ce site qui récence des études de cas : Cases 2.0 .
Pour conclure , j’aimerais vous préciser quelque chose : les pratiques d’Entreprise 2.0 sont déjà en cours au sein de votre organisation .
Vos collaborateurs ont en effet déjà créé leur profil Linked In , ils lisent déjà des blogs et possèdent une page Netvibes , ils consultent régulièrement Wikipedia ou YouTube .
Ces pratiques sont pour le moment restreintes à une petite part des collaborateurs ( ceux qui sont le plus à l’aise avec l’internet ) , mais qu’en sera - t - il dans 5 ans ?
Modifier les outils et habitudes de travail est un gros chantier , surtout dans une grosse organisation .
Il est donc essentiel d’entamer dès à présent une réflexion de fond sur l’Entreprise 2.0 avant que les nouveaux diplômés de la génération MySpace et Skyblog arrivent sur le marché du travail et ne fuient votre entreprise ( car ils la trouveront trop ringarde ) pour postuler chez vos concurrents .
In the years that followed 9/11 , two phenomena characterized the Western public 's understanding of the terrorists ' ideology .
The first characteristic stemmed from the statements made by the jihadists themselves .
More than ever , Islamist militants and jihadi cadres did n't waste any opportunity to declare , clarify , explain , and detail the meaning of their aqida ( doctrine ) and their intentions to apply Jihadism by all means possible .
Unfortunately for them , though , those extremely violent means changed the international public opinion : the public now was convinced that there was an ideology of Jihadism , and that its adherents meant business worldwide .
From Ayman al Zawahiri in Arabic to Azzam al Amriki in American English , via all of the videotapes made by " martyrs " in Britain , Iraq , and Afghanistan , the public obtained all the evidence necessary .
Against all the faulty academic literature of the 1990's , the statements by the jihadists themselves were very convincing .
The second phenomenon of help to the public was the surfacing of a new literature produced by alternative scholars , analysts , journalists , experts , and researchers who , from different backgrounds and countries , filled in some of the gaps is " jihadi studies . "
Producing books , articles , and blogs from Europe , India , the Middle East , and North America , a combination of Third World - born and Western - issued scholarship began to provide the " missing link " as to what Jihadism is all about .
These factors came together to shift the debate from " Jihad is spiritual yoga " to " Why did n't we know it was something else as well ? "
And this triggered in response one of the last attempts to prevent jihad from being understood .
In the 1990's , apologist literature attempted to convince readers and audiences in the West that jihad was a " spiritual experience only , and not a menace . " [ 1 ]
That explanation has now been shattered by Bin Laden and Ahmedinijad .
So in the post - 9/11 age , a second strategy to delay public understanding of Jihadism and thereby gain time for its adherents to achieve their goals has evolved .
It might be called the " good cop , bad cop " strategy .
Over the past few years , a new story began to make inroads in Washington and the rest of the national defense apparatus .
A group of academics and interest groups are circulating the idea that in reality jihad can develop in two forms : good jihad and bad jihad .
The practice of not using " Jihad " and " Jihadism " was lately defended by two academics at the National Defense University [ 2 ] who based their arguments on a study published by a Washington lobbyist , Jim Guirard . [ 3 ]
On June 22 , 2006 , Jim Garamone , writing for the American Forces Press Service , published the study of Douglas Streusand and Harry Tunnel under the title " Loosly Interpreted Arabic terms can promote enemy ideology . "
Streusand told CNN that " Jihad is a term of great and positive import in Islam .
It is commonly defined as striving or struggle , and can mean an internal or external struggle for faith . " [ 4 ]
The article was posted under the title " Cultural Ignorance Leads to Misuse of Islamic Terms " by the US - based Islamist organization CAIR . [ 5 ]
Since then the " concept " of deflecting attention away from the study of Jihadism has penetrated large segments of the defense newsletters and is omnipresent in Academia .
More troubling though , is the fact that scholars who have seen the strategic threat of al Qaeda and Hezbollah have unfortunately fallen for the fallacy of the Hiraba .
Professor Michael Waller of the Institute of World Politics in Washington wrote recently that " Jihad has been hijacked " as he bases his argument on Jim Guirard 's lobbying pieces . [ 6 ]
Satisfied with this trend taking root in the Defense intelligentsia of America , Islamist intellectuals and activists are hurrying to support this new tactic .
The good holy war is when the right religious and political authorities declare it against the correct enemy and at the right time .
The bad jihad , called also Hiraba , is the wrong war , declared by bad ( and irresponsible ) people against the wrong enemy ( for the moment ) , and without an appropriate authorization by the " real " Muslim leadership .
According to this thesis , those Muslims who wage a Hiraba , a wrong war , are called Mufsidoon , from the Arabic word for " spoilers . "
The advocates of this ruse recommend that the United States and its allies stop calling the jihadists by that name and identifying the concept of Jihadism as the problem .
In short , they argue that " jihad is good , but the Mufsidoon , the bad guys and the terrorists , spoiled the original legitimate sense . " [ 7 ]
When researched , it turns out that this theory was produced by clerics of the Wahabi regime in Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood as a plan to prevent jihad and Jihadism from being considered by the West and the international community as an illegal and therefore forbidden activity .
It was then forwarded to American - and Western - based interest groups to be spread within the Untied States , particularly within the defense and security apparatus .
Such a deception further confuses U.S. national security perception of the enemy and plunges democracies back into the " black hole " of the 1990's .
This last attempt to blur the vision of democracies can be exposed with knowledge of the jihadi terror strategies and tactics , one of which is known as Taqiya , the doctrine on deception and deflection . [ 8 ]
First , the argument of " good jihad " raises the question of how there can be a legitimate concept of religious war in the twenty - first century to start with .
Jihad historically was as " good " as any other religious war over the last 2,000 years .
If a " good jihad " is the one authorized by a caliph and directed under his auspices , then other world leaders also can wage a " good crusade " at will , as long as it is licensed by the proper authority .
But in fact , all religious wars are proscribed by international law , period .
Second , the authors of this lobbyist - concocted theory claim that a wrong jihad is called a Hiraba .
But in Arab Muslim history , a Hiraba ( unauthorized warring ) was when a group of warriors launched itself against the enemy without orders from the real commander .
Obviously , this implies that a " genuine " war against a real enemy does exist and that these hotheaded soldiers have simply acted without orders .
Hence this cunning explanation puts " spin " on jihad but leaves the core idea of jihadism completely intact .
The " spoilers " depart from the plan , attack prematurely , and cause damage to the caliphate 's long - terms plans .
These Mufsidoon " fail " their commanders by unleashing a war of their own , instead of waiting for orders .
This scenario fits the relations of the global jihadists , who are the regimes and international groups slowly planning to gain power against the infidels and the " hotheaded " Osama bin Laden .
Thus the promoters of this theory of Hiraba and Mufsidoon are representing the views of classical Wahabis and the Muslim Brotherhood in their criticism of the " great leap forward " made by bin Laden .
But by convincing Westerners that al Qaeda and its allies are not the real jihadists but some renegades , the advocates of this school would be causing the vision of Western defense to become blurred again so that more time could be gained by a larger , more powerful wave of Jihadism that is biding its time to strike when it chooses , under a coherent international leadership .

It lists the brewer , the beer and the details of the beer .
It is divided into several sections , starting with the Independent brewers , then the home breweries , the Firkin breweries , the big breweries , house beers , special occaision beers , festival beers and defunct breweries .

This is the same list as above , but in the order that I drunk them in .
Unfortunately , it only starts at my 1000th beer , but has been a useful cross check in keeping my numbers correct .
I will try and sort out the first 1000 into order and add them to the list !

In fact , the state has always paid great attention to the problems that have arisen in the development of the real estate industry and have continuously adopted policy measures to solve them .
The long and orderly process only differs in direction , focus , tasks , and measures in different periods .

The task of …
What does it mean to be a nation at war ?
Is it possible to exercise democratic control over a wartime government that dismisses honest criticism as unpatriotic ?
What should citizens do when members of their military not only commit crimes -- as happens during every war -- but also rely on propaganda to hide mistakes and to embellish or even create victories , as happened in the cases of Army Ranger Pat Tillman and Private Jessica Lynch ?
Those are big questions , but a few things are clear .
One is that the secrecy , deception and constraints sought by wartime administrations are anathema to the transparency , accountability and freedom necessary to democracy .
As James Madison warned , " Of all the enemies of public liberty , war is perhaps the most to be dreaded , because it comprises and develops the germ of every other . "
Another truism is that citizens retain the right to receive information and provide guidance to their government during wartime .
The last is that , while security concerns may legitimately restrict what information can be shared when , maintaining civilian oversight of war operations helps ensure that human rights standards are upheld .
Perhaps the most important effort to provide oversight of ongoing U.S. wars was the April 24 Congressional hearing on battlefield misinformation .
The hearing focused on the wounding , capture and rescue of Jessica Lynch in Iraq in March 2003 , and on the death of Pat Tillman in Afghanistan in April 2004 .
For more than four hours , the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform heard a remarkable amount of information .
There were often emotional first - hand accounts ; analyses by a medical doctor , dedicated family members and military inspectors ; and many questions from members of Congress .
Ideally , news media would have covered the hearing in depth and hosted wide - ranging discussions and debates of the issues raised .
Instead , the overwhelming majority of news outlets only showed , quoted or described the opening remarks of the hearing 's first witness panel , and then moved on to their next story .
What went unreported were shocking truths about the Lynch and Tillman incidents and the many remaining questions , as well as new insights into military misinformation .
The exchanges highlighted below , drawn from testimony given throughout the hearing , fill in these blanks .
For an analysis that places the hearing in the context of news coverage at the time of the incidents , see Robin Andersen 's article , " ' Mission Accomplished , ' Four Years Later . "
Other Soldiers , Other Questions
Perhaps the most under - reported aspect of the hearing was the list of U.S. soldiers whose injuries or deaths remain mired in secrecy .
Pat Tillman 's brother and fellow Army Ranger Kevin Tillman advocated strongly for other families still waiting for answers .
Kevin told the stories of the following soldiers , all of whom were killed in Iraq :
First Lieutenant Ken Ballard : " His mom , Karen Meredith , was told that Ken was killed by a sniper on a rooftop , " recounted Kevin .
" Fifteen months later , she found out that he was killed by an unmanned gun from his own vehicle . "
: " His mom , Karen Meredith , was told that Ken was killed by a sniper on a rooftop , " recounted Kevin .
" Fifteen months later , she found out that he was killed by an unmanned gun from his own vehicle . "
Private Jesse Buryj : " His family was told he was killed in a vehicle accident .
A year later , they received the autopsy report , and they found that he was shot in the back .
The Army was forced to concede that he was accidentally shot by a Polish soldier .
Just recently , out of nowhere , a Lieutenant showed up at their family 's house and told them that an officer in his own unit had shot him . "

Staff Sergeant Brian Hellerman :
His wife , Dawn Hellerman , called Kevin Tillman late one night .
" She was tired of receiving new official reasons why her husband had died .
She was desperate for help .
...
The system had failed her . "

Sergeant Patrick McCafferty : " The family was told , it was -- quote -- ' an ambush by insurgents . '
Two years later , they found out that those -- quote -- ' insurgents ' happened to be the same Iraqi troops that he was training .
Before his death , he told his chain of command that these same troops that he was training were trying to kill him and his team .
He was told to keep his mouth shut . "
Members of Congress named other soldiers whose families have received misleading information :
Sergeant Eddie Ryan , who was wounded in Iraq : " He sustained two gunshot wounds to the head and , thankfully , is still alive , " said House Oversight Committee Chair Henry Waxman .
" He did n't find out the truth about his injuries until five months later , even though his fellow Marines knew immediately that his injuries were due to friendly fire . "

Private First Class LaVena Johnson , who died in Iraq from what the Army says was a self - inflicted gunshot wound , a claim contradicted by multiple pieces of evidence .
" For almost two years , Dr. and Mrs. Johnson have been trying to get at the truth about what happened to their daughter , " said Rep. William Clay .
Later in the hearing , Clay listed the key information requested from the Army , on behalf of the Johnsons : " A CD containing the original photos from the criminal investigation into Private Johnson 's death and the original autopsy photos , missing medical records from Private Johnson 's file , all psychological evaluations that may have been made of Private Johnson , and the identity of the lead investigator into her death . "
Private Johnson 's family has filed a Freedom of Information Act request , as have the Small and Ballard families .
But it 's unclear whether these requests -- and the memory of their loved ones -- will be honored by the Pentagon .
Creating the Narrative
Most of the Congressional hearing focused on Private Jessica Lynch and Corporal Pat Tillman .
In addition to uncovering new information and raising unanswered questions , the Lynch and Tillman testimony showed how well -- and , at times , how irresponsibly -- the U.S. military manages the media .
Shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq , Lynch became renowned as a plucky young soldier who bravely resisted an enemy ambush , but was seriously wounded and captured .
After U.S. soldiers rescued her in a nighttime raid , Lynch 's story became an allegory for the courageousness and righteousness of U.S. troops in Iraq .
Except that it did n't quite happen like that .
British reporters quickly debunked Lynch 's rescue as a staged media event , and , once she was well enough to realize and respond to the narrative , Lynch herself disavowed the rest .
During the hearing , Rep. Waxman added another wrinkle -- evidence that the " rescue " operation had been delayed , for publicity purposes :
Rep. Henry Waxman :
The military had an opportunity to rescue you , when you were captive for ten days .
But there was a whole day , before they captured you , when they were preparing not just to rescue you , but to videotape the rescue .
Were you aware of that , or aware of it now ?
Private Jessica Lynch :
Not at the time , I was n't aware that they were videotaping me , no .
But after the fact , yeah I knew about it and now , you know , I kind of understand why they did it .
Waxman :
Well , maybe you understand it .
... I come from Hollywood .
I expect show business in Hollywood , not from the military and not to support a story that was a fabrication .
...
Our staff interviewed Jim Wilkinson , the director of strategic communications at CENTCOM ( U.S. Central Command ) .
He informed us of the plans of your rescue operation .
He informed the press operation a full day before it happened .
Waxman later questioned Lt. Col. John Robinson , who was a CENTCOM spokesperson during the Lynch incident :
Rep. Henry Waxman : Lt. Col. Robinson , you were interviewed about this rescue video by the Washington Post .
...
Your statement , according to the Post , was -- quote -- ' We let them know , if possible we wanted to get it .
We 'd like to have ' the video .
' We were hoping we would have good visuals .
We knew it would be the hottest thing of the day .
There was not an intent to talk it down or embellish it because we did n't need to .
It was an awesome story . '
You say you let them know that you wanted to tape the rescue .
Who is the ' them ' you were referring to -- the rescue team , the operations folks ?
...
Do you recall the quote ?
Lt. Col. John Robinson :
No , sir , I do n't remember speaking to them about Jessica Lynch , but I can tell you where the visuals would have come from .
The visuals would have come from an officer who was assigned to the SOP [ Special Operations ] unit , who had an additional duty of providing visuals back to the press center .
These were not the only visuals that we received from this unit .
And we got visuals all day , every day , throughout that particular operation .
And so , these visuals that we received would have been visuals that we would have requested as soon as we found out that there was a potential rescue .
Much like the dramatic rescue footage was essential to the Lynch story , the televised memorial service and posthumous award given Corporal Pat Tillman cemented and promoted the false narrative around his death .
That football hero turned soldier Pat Tillman had been killed by his fellow troops in Afghanistan was known immediately , and rapidly reported up the chain of command .
However , for more than a month , Tillman 's family and the U.S. public were told that Pat had been killed by the enemy , while bravely protecting other U.S. soldiers .
During the House hearing , Rep. Bruce Braley asked Specialist Bryan O'Neal and the Acting Inspector General of the Defense Department , Thomas Gimble , about the statements used in Tillman 's Silver Star Award :
Rep. Bruce Braley :
In addition to being an eyewitness to Corporal Tillman 's death and reporting this incident up the chain of command , you were also involved in writing a statement that was used to award Corporal Tillman the Silver Star .
Do you remember that ?
Specialist Bryan O'Neal : Yes , sir .
Braley : ...
Was this a situation where they gave you a sheet of paper and told you to write down , in your own words , your best recollection of the events that had happened , or did someone prepare a statement for you to review and sign ?
O'Neal :
What happened , sir , was I got sat behind a computer and I was told to type up my recollection of what happened .
And as soon as I was done typing , I was relieved to go back to my platoon , sir .
And that was the last I heard of it .
Braley :
So when you finished typing your statement , it was in a digital format that had not been printed out .
Is that correct ?
O'Neal : Roger that , sir .
Braley : ... Did you ever sign , in your handwriting , a statement that you had reviewed and verified the authenticity of ?
O'Neal : Negative , sir .
Braley : Now I want to ask you about the statement that was ultimately used in the Silver Star commendation .
...
This version of the statement also says you -- quote -- ' engaged the enemy very successfully ' -- end quote .
That the enemy moved most of their attention to your position which -- quote -- ' drew a lot of fire from them . '
Did you write these sentences , claiming that you were engaged with the enemy ?
O'Neal : No , sir .
Braley :
Do you know who made the changes to your statement , to make it appear as if you were receiving fire from the enemy , rather than from your own platoon ?
O'Neal : No , sir .
Braley : Mr. Gimble , the Inspector General 's office investigated these alterations to the witnesses ' statements and flagged these differences as well .
But in the course of your investigation , did you ever discover who specifically changed this language and why that language was changed ?
Hon. Thomas Gimble : ...
The citations that we got were part of the package that we got of the General Jones investigation [ into Tillman 's death ] .
And they were not signed , it just had stamped as ' original , signed . '
And my investigators went back to Specialist O'Neal and the sergeant and said , ' Did you write these ? '
And they said no , that they did not .
...
We were unable to determine who in the chain of command actually did the alterations .
Senior Chief Petty Officer Stephen
White was a friend of Pat Tillman 's and the only active - duty military member to speak at the televised memorial service .
During the hearing ,
White explained that he based his memorial service speech on the altered Silver Star documents :
Rep. William Clay :
You were not with Corporal Tillman in Afghanistan when he was killed .
Is that correct ?
Senior Chief Petty Officer Stephen
White :
That 's correct , sir .
Clay :
Then how did you become aware of the details surrounding his death ?
White :
The initial , sporadic stuff that I got was from Kevin [ Tillman , Pat 's brother ] himself .
The morning of the memorial , I do n't recall exactly how I got word but , I knew that they wanted me to ... let the family know , that he was going to be presented with the Silver Star .
In order to do that in the presentation , I wanted to , basically , to surmise what had happened on the target site .
I called an enlisted person whose name I cannot recall .
I believe he was with the 75th Ranger Battalion .
The morning of , he read the citation to me , over the phone .
I summarized in my own words , asked him if that was an accurate summarization .
He said it was , and that 's what I went with in my speech .
Hiding the Truth
For false narratives to gain currency , the truth must be suppressed .
In Private Jessica Lynch 's case , her injuries kept her from correcting the public record for some time .
But her doctor was another matter .
Dr. Gene Bolles , a neurosurgeon and military contractor at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany , was one of the first people to examine Lynch following her " rescue . "
During the Congressional hearing , he said it was clear that Lynch had no bullet wounds -- contrary to already widely - reported stories of her combat heroism -- and that her wounds were consistent with a serious vehicle accident .
Then Rep. John Yarmuth asked Bolles whether he had been restricted in his public remarks at the time :
Rep. John Yarmuth : Did you have to sign any kind of nondisclosure agreement ?
Dr. Gene Bolles : Yes , I did .
Yarmuth : ...
Were you asked to sign this specifically for the Lynch case ?
Bolles : ... Before she left , the day before or the day of , I was asked to sign something to say that this would not be discussed , also .
Yarmuth :
And you had never been asked to sign anything like that , involving any other patient of yours ?
Bolles :
No , sir .
Yarmuth : ... Did you think it was peculiar , that you were asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement for one patient ?
Bolles :
At the time , no .
I 'm not sure I do now .
... Yarmuth : Looking back at it now , are you suspicious ?
...
What do you think was behind their action ?
Bolles : I really do n't think I have an opinion on that , sir .
It may have been standard procedure for a highly visible situation such as Private Lynch was .
I do n't know .
With regard to Corporal Pat Tillman 's death , eyewitness accounts and reports quickly relayed up the chain of command blatantly contradicted the U.S. military 's preferred narrative .
During the House hearing , Rep. Elijah Cummings described what is known about these high - level communications :
Rep. Elijah Cummings :
We have an email that was written on April 28 , 2004 , six days after Pat Tillman 's death .
...
It describes how the White House was asking for information about Corporal Tillman , for the President to use in a speech at the White House Correspondents ' Dinner .
...
The next day , April 29 , 2004 , an urgent communication was sent to the highest levels of the Army command structure , alerting them that friendly fire was the suspected cause of death .
This communication is called a Personal Four , that is P - 4 , memo .
...
It [ the P - 4 memo ] goes on to express concern that the President or Defense Secretary might suffer -- quote -- ' public embarrassment , if the circumstances of Corporal Tillman 's death become public ' -- end of quote .
...
When the President spoke at the Correspondents ' Dinner , he was careful in his wording .
He praised Pat Tillman 's courage , but carefully avoided describing how he was killed .
During the hearing , several members of Congress and witnesses asked :
Which military and government officials were rapidly informed that Tillman had been killed by " friendly fire , " but kept that truth from his family and from the public for more than a month ?
Reps. Cummings and Waxman wondered if President Bush 's cautious words at the White House Correspondents '
Dinner indicate that he , or someone in his office , knew .
Based on then - CENTCOM chief John Abizaid 's trip to Afghanistan shortly after Tillman 's death , the number of high - ranking military officers who definitely knew , and then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's previous correspondence with Tillman , Pat 's mother Mary Tillman said she believes that Rumsfeld knew the real cause of Pat 's death .
The hearing also brought to light a chilling account of the " friendly fire " incident , which Mary Tillman paraphrased from an investigation by Brigadier General Gary Jones :
Mary Tillman :
At this particular moment , they [ the soldiers who shot and killed Pat ] got excited .
They were not afraid .
When they were asked about this particular engagement , not once did they say they were afraid .
Not once did they say they were being fired upon .
They said they were excited .
Or one said , I wanted to be in a firefight .
General Jones asked , ' Did you PID [ positively identify ] your target ? '
' No , I wanted to be in a firefight . '
When they asked , ' Did you see waving hands ? '
' Yes , we saw waving hands . '
' What did it look like , ' General Jones asked .
' It looked like they were trying to say , hey , it 's us . '
And yet , they fired at them .
Strangely , the Army 's criminal investigation found that the soldiers who killed Tillman had not broken the rules of engagement .
Civilians Are People , Too
Following the hearing , Oversight Committee Chair Waxman sent letters to Defense Secretary Robert Gates and White House Counsel Fred Fielding , asking for documents clarifying " how and when " high - ranking Defense Department and White House officials " learned of the circumstances surrounding Corporal Tillman 's death . "
Of course , battlefield misinformation does n't just surround U.S. soldiers .
Many more Afghan and Iraqi civilians have died under questionable circumstances .
The New York Times recently reported new information about U.S. military assaults on civilians in Haditha , Iraq and in Jalalabad , Afghanistan .
The Haditha revelations eerily echo the circumstances surrounding Pat Tillman 's death .
Immediately following the November 2005 U.S. assault , the Iraqi civilian deaths were reported up the chain of command .
However , that information was suppressed , because the Haditha killings represented , in the words of the Times report , " a potential public relations problem that could fuel insurgent propaganda against the American military . "
U.S. soldiers also attempted to deny the truth about the March 2007 Jalalabad killings , destroying photos and video that journalists had taken at the scene .
A military official explained that " untrained people " might " capture visual details that are not as they originally were . "
Two months later , the U.S. military apologized and paid $ 2,000 to the surviving family members of the 19 civilians killed .
What happened in Jalalabad and Haditha , to Pat Tillman , Jessica Lynch and LaVena Johnson , and to many other soldiers and civilians caught up in U.S. wars is n't due to malicious intent .
Tragedies and lies happen whenever human beings are put into a war zone .
This does n't excuse them .
It does mean that U.S. citizens should accept a share of the responsibility , and insist upon truth and accountability , lest our democracy become wartime " collateral damage . "

Australian comedy team exposes APEC security hype
By Patrick O’Connor
8 September 2007
A moment of absurdist satire in Sydney last Thursday exposed the farcical security measures imposed for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit as well as providing something of a popular rallying point for opposition to the military - police lockdown .
Members of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ’s “ The Chaser ’s War on Everything ” television program assembled a fake motorcade involving three vehicles with dark tinted windows , Canadian flags attached , accompanied by dark suited men walking alongside .
They travelled the same route as the motorcades of dignitaries of 21 countries and drove through two police checkpoints , before entering the APEC “ restricted zone ” .
Comedian Chas Licciardello , sitting inside one of the cars , was dressed as Osama bin Laden .
Upon nearly reaching US President George Bush ’s hotel , he leapt out of the car , the motorcade turned around , and the team gave themselves up .
Chris Taylor of “ The Chaser ” later told the Sydney Morning Herald there was no particular reason they chose Canadian flags .
“ We just thought they ’d be a country who the cops would n’t scrutinise too closely , and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade — as opposed to the 20 or so gas - guzzlers that Bush has brought with him . ”
According to one report , “ The Chaser ” expected their “ motorcade ” to be stopped at one of the many checkpoints surrounding the 5 kilometre - long and 2.8 metre - high metal fence encircling sections of central Sydney .
Instead , they were waved through by police , who only realised what had happened when the vehicles stopped within metres of Sydney ’s Intercontinental Hotel .
An ABC source told the Daily Telegraph : “ Chas got out of a car dressed as Osama Bin Laden and said something like ‘ I ’m an important world leader , why do n’t I have a seat at the APEC table ? ’
Apparently that was the first time the police realised it was not authentic and they swooped in and arrested everybody . ”
Eleven people from the ABC program were detained .
Under special legislation introduced by the state Labor government for the APEC summit , they face six months imprisonment for entering a restricted area without justification .
The potential penalty will increase to two years jail time if police allege that “ circumstances of aggression exist in relation to the offence ” .
Police spokesmen angrily condemned “ The Chaser ” .
Their denunciations were clearly driven by a deep sense of embarrassment at the ease with which their unprecedented security measures were penetrated .
Fake ID badges worn by the mock secret service agents who ran alongside the “ motorcade ” read : “ Chaser ’s War :
It ’s pretty obvious this is n’t a real pass ” .
The vehicles in the cavalcade featured “ APEC official vehicle ” stickers , which read : “ This vehicle belongs to ‘ The Chaser ’s War on Everything ’ .
This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him . ”
NSW Police Minister David Campbell managed to make himself look even sillier after the event by claiming a security success .
“ I think this reinforces that APEC security has been successful by the mere fact that 11 people have been arrested , ” he declared .
“ I offer my congratulations to those police officers for their diligent work . ”
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer also chimed in : “ They were arrested , so that shows the security system works . ”
“ The Chaser ” team made an entirely appropriate mockery of the APEC security measures .
The scale of the operation — which involves about 5,000 police and soldiers and is budgeted to cost $ 330 million — bears no relationship to any genuine threat to the safety of Bush or any of the other world leaders .
Authorities have admitted they have no intelligence of a planned terrorist attack , and the official terror alert level has remained unaltered for the APEC summit .
The “ bin Laden ” prank has resonated with large sections of Sydney ’s population , where the massive security clampdown is regarded with derision , contempt and outrage .
Newspaper web site opinion polls , letters columns and radio talkback have recorded overwhelming support for “ The Chaser ” along with hostility to the Howard government and the police .
On the ABC ’s web site , Francine wrote : “ Well done Chasers !!
You sum up all the frustration that we feel about having to put up with totally desperate and unnecessary ‘ strong armed ’ measures used by John Howard and the Liberal party in order to look like they are in control .
Yes , it is our money the Federal Govt is wasting .
Imagine if that money was put towards the poor and homeless , schools or hospitals in Sydney ? ”
On the Sydney Morning Herald ’s site , Paul wrote : “ If the threat is as serious as the security indicates the government is recklessly endangering the people of Sydney .
None of the security is to protect average people — it is about isolating the ‘ leaders ’ from the general public .
If the threat is exaggerated , as I strongly suspect , then they should be held to account for wasting so many resources and yet again lying to the public .
Either way there is no justification for holding this event in Sydney and treating the entire population as a violent threat .
What a farce . ”
Many of the police actions are simply ridiculous .
Restaurants and cafes in central Sydney have been told to remove knives and forks from outside tables in case they are used as weapons , while office workers in high - rise blocks have reportedly been instructed not to look at patrolling helicopters .
Other measures are highly provocative .
Snipers have been placed on top of hotels in central Sydney , in helicopters now constantly patrolling the city , and in other vantage points , including atop the Sydney Opera House .
One anonymous person wrote on the Herald ’s web site : “ I have just walked through Martin Place , right in the APEC ‘ stop & search ’ zone and witnessed something I hope never to see again in this country — a random person , who happened to be carrying a small backpack , being stopped and searched by no fewer than 6 NSW police officers .
In the space of a single city block I counted no fewer than 32 police officers .
None of this made me feel either secure or relaxed and comfortable .
Why is it suddenly OK for police officers to demand to inspect journalists ’ notebooks , to stop and search magistrates in Hyde Park ( well outside the stop & search zone and therefore illegal ) or to stop and search anyone at all .
Why is it OK for police to instruct tourists , or anyone , to delete photos of a security fence ?
Why is it OK to have snipers on building tops in our largest city ?
What is it about this week that our personal freedoms and liberties should be set aside in the alleged name of security for a few ? ”
On Thursday , a police helicopter flew alongside the Sydney Harbour Bridge and a sniper inside pointed his gun at pedestrians .
Amy McIntosh told ninemsn news : “ He had a big sniper gun pointed out at all the pedestrians .
I just could n’t believe what I was seeing .
I just felt it was really over the top .
It was really loud and it was so close and I ’ve never been that close to an airborne chopper before .
Either they were looking for Osama Bin Laden or trying to intimidate the locals . ”
In a chilling statement , Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione warned that “ The Chaser ” crew was lucky not to have been shot .
“ The reality is they put security services in a position where they might have had to take an action no one would want , ” he declared .
“ We have snipers deployed around the city .
They were n’t there for show , they mean business , that ’s what they were there for . ”
In the wake of last year 's e-voting debacle in Florida 's Sarasota county and the widespread publicity regarding serious security flaws in computerized voting machines , there is considerable political momentum for e-voting reform .
We 've previously reported on a reform proposal by California 's secretary of state .
Congress is also getting in on the action .
Rep Rush Holt ( D - NJ ) has emerged as the leader of the e-voting reform movement in Congress .
He is the lead sponsor of HR 811 , the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act , which has garnered dozens of co-sponsors .
HR 811 features several requirements that will warm the hearts of geek activists .
It bans the use of computerized voting machines that lack a voter - verified paper trail .
It mandates that the paper records be the authoritative source in any recounts , and requires prominent notices reminding voters to double - check the paper record before leaving the polling place .
It mandates automatic audits of at least three percent of all votes cast to detect discrepancies between the paper and electronic records .
It bans voting machines that contain wireless networking hardware and prohibits connecting voting machines to the Internet .
Finally , it requires that the source code for e-voting machines be made publicly available .
The legislation received extensive hearings in recent weeks in the House Administration Committee 's Subcommittee on Elections .
The proposal has attracted broad support from public interest groups and security experts .
Representatives from the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the Brennan Center for Justice , and People for the American Way have all testified in support .
An important endorsement came from Ed Felten , the Princeton security researcher who last year demonstrated that Diebold 's e-voting machines can be infected by a vote - stealing virus .
He testified in support of the legislation on March 23 , emphasizing that paperless e-voting systems lack the transparency that is essential to secure elections .
The proposal was n't without its detractors , however .
Several state election officials testified about the practical challenges of implementing the new requirements .
Chris Nelson , South Dakota 's secretary of state , warned that many of the requirements in the legislation would conflict with the states ' own election procedures .
For example , South Dakota 's current procedures allow certification of election results in seven days , but Nelson said the audit procedures of HR 811 could delay the certification of election results by weeks .
Gail W. Mahoney from Jackson County , Michigan , warned that many election officials would be unable to meet the tight deadlines in the legislation .
A few witnesses testified against the very notion of requiring a voter - verified paper trail .
Disability rights advocate Harold Snider compared opponents of e-voting to Luddites and chastised them for their lack of faith in technology .
He also argued that computerized voting machines would provide better access to the disabled , and warned that requiring paper trails would discourage their adoption .
Donald F. Norris , a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland , emphasized the flaws of paper - based voting systems and argued that computerized voting machines were more secure .
Serious concerns were raised regarding the flaws with the printers used to produce paper audit trails .
Norris cited a Las Vegas survey in which fewer than 40 percent of voters actually checked the paper record of their vote before leaving the polling place .
An election official in North Carolina reported that there were hundreds of printer failures in that state during the 2006 election .
He cited a Georgia study about the logistical challenges of storing , tracking , and manually counting thousands of votes recorded on unwieldy rolls of paper tape .
The pleas of state officials for more flexibility in implementing the law 's requirements deserve serious consideration .
Some states may have election procedures that match or exceed the rigor of the federal requirements , and it would be foolish to require a state to overhaul its election procedures if the existing procedures are consistent with the spirit of the new federal requirements .
Luckily , the Holt bill does give states some options .
For example , states are allowed to use auditing procedures other than those spelled out in HR 811 , as long as the National Institute for Science and Technology certifies that they will be no less effective .
The concerns about problems with printing and voter - verification are also worth taking seriously , but here states have a simple solution : they can decline to use computerized voting machines entirely .
The Holt bill gives states the option of using old - fashioned optical - scan paper ballots , which have been used with few problems for decades .
Although some activists have argued for a formal ban on computerized voting machines , the approach of Holt 's legislation gives states more flexibility while avoiding the most serious pitfalls of computerized voting .
As we 've emphasized before , the details of e-voting reform legislation matter .
The critics ' concerns should not be brushed aside lightly .
But HR 811 appears to have been drafted with careful attention to such details .
Although it certainly has some room for improvement — especially in ensuring that states are not forced to overhaul election procedures that already work well — it's a thoughtful piece of legislation that promises to substantially improve the integrity of our elections .
Blackwater workers rarely interact with Iraqis in Baghdad , and regulations forbid them to travel outside the Green Zone when they are not on well - armed missions to protect State Department officials .
Most convoys through the city do not carry Iraqi translators , leaving the young guards , former military men , to judge whether a gesture , a foreign phrase or a glance suggests a threat strong enough to justify a violent response .
Even in the Blackwater compound , no definitive account has emerged of how and why the Sept. 16 shootings occurred , company employees said .
For its part , Blackwater has said that its guards were responding to an insurgent attack .
But in furtive discussions over recent weeks , certain details about the episode , they said , have gained currency among many Blackwater workers , many of whom would like to believe that their colleagues acted appropriately .
Those workers said , for example , that Blackwater guards who fired at Iraqis in Nisour Square described how an Iraqi driver had pulled up his car well after the Blackwater convoy had arrived and warned traffic to stay back .
The encroaching car , the workers said , caused their colleagues to feel threatened and initiate machine - gun fire .
They also said that friction between Blackwater convoys and groups of armed Iraqi police in the days before the shooting had created a mutual distrust , and that the police officers , perhaps as a result of earlier disputes , fired at the Blackwater convoy .
“ The Iraqi police were testing these guys at various intersections , ” said one former Blackwater guard who has spoken with men on the convoy at Nisour Square .
Iraqi police at the intersection have said they were not armed that day , and none of the dozens of Iraqi witnesses interviewed by Iraqi investigators and reporters for The New York Times said they saw anyone firing at the Blackwater convoy or even brandishing a weapon .
But in a measure of the gulf between the narratives that have taken hold in the Blackwater compound and on the streets of Baghdad , the former guard and a current employee said that a consistent view had developed within the compound : that Blackwater was fired upon by Iraqis with AK - 47s who fled the scene after Blackwater returned an overwhelming amount of fire .
“ How long does it take for a dead terrorist to become a dead civilian ? ” a Blackwater employee said .
“ As long as it takes to remove an AK - 47 from the body , ” suggesting that accomplices might have removed weapons as they fled .
2 . " I 'm going off the rails on a crazy train ... "
1 . There 's what in the where ?!
3 . Yeah , we felt guilty about this image ; this woman 's actually crazy .
Still , wow , a computer chip in her uterus .
4 . He forgot to include ' holier than thou ' rednecks .
5 . I can buy , ' Castrate Those Who Rape Children , ' but come on , lighten up .
6 . We 're still not exactly sure who they 're offended by .
7 . " What 's up , doc ? "
8 . Do we really want to know what incident gave rise to this sign ?
9 . " I do n't know if God exists , but it would be better for His reputation if He did n't . "
Jules Renard
Amen , brother .
The jury on Monday found four men guilty of conspiracy to murder
Muktar Ibrahim , 29 , Yassin Omar , 26 , Ramzi Mohammed , 25 , and Hussain Osman , 28 , were found guilty on Monday .
Their plot to detonate explosives on three Tube trains and a bus in London in 2005 was a " viable ... attempt at mass murder " , the judge said .
Two other men - Manfo Kwaku Asiedu and Adel Yahya - face a retrial after the first jury failed to reach a verdict .
' Devastation '
The judge , Mr Justice Fulford , said the failed attacks were clearly connected with the bombings that killed 52 people in London two weeks earlier .
" What happened on July 7 in 2005 is of considerable relevance to this sentencing .
" I have no doubt that they were both part of an al - Qaeda - inspired and controlled sequence of attacks , " he said during sentencing at Woolwich Crown Court .
While the implementation of their plan was incompetent , their aim was clear - they wanted to kill and maim on a massive scale
Sue Hemming , Crown Prosecution Service
Patient wait for sentencing
He added they had designed the plot for " maximum impact " and had carried it out " with their eyes wide open " .
Referring to the attacks of 7/7 , Mr Justice Fulford told the court : " The family and friends of the dead and the injured , the hundreds , indeed thousands , captured underground in terrifying circumstances - the smoke , the screams of the wounded and the dying - this each defendant knew .
" After 7/ 7 each defendant knew exactly what the result would be . "
He said the scientific evidence produced during the trial had shown the plan came " very close to succeeding " .
" If the detonators had been slightly more powerful or the hydrogen peroxide slightly more concentrated , then each bomb would have exploded . "
Sentences ' not too long '
None of the men could be considered for release for 40 years , he concluded .
In court to hear the sentencing was former soldier Arthur Burton - Garbett , 72 , who gave chase at Oval Tube station after Mohammed failed to detonate his bomb .
We have had two world wars to fight for our freedom in this country and we can't let these sort of people get away with it
Arthur Burton - Garbett
On board the bomb train
The judge praised Mr Burton - Garbett 's commitment to public duty and said he had raced up the escalator " with impressive speed " .
Speaking outside court , Mr Burton - Garbett , from Morden , south London , said of the judge : " He gave them not a day too long .
" We have had two world wars to fight for our freedom in this country and we can't let these sort of people get away with it . "
During sentencing , the judge criticised Arani & Co , the solicitors acting for Ibrahim and Omar , for what he called a " relentless and blistering attack " on the staff at Belmarsh prison where the two men were held .
Mr Justice Fulford said complaints made against the staff were " no more than a smokescreen " .
Mudassar Arani insisted the judge 's criticism of her firm was " inappropriate " , but said she was unable to make public facts which she claimed would prove she had acted " in accordance with my professional duty " .
She added : " HMP Belmarsh was the subject of adverse comments by HMP Inspectorate of Prisons on some of the grounds which were the subject of my complaints . "
' Brutal intent '
Sue Hemming , head of counter terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) , said the four jailed men had seen the " devastation " caused on 7/7 and " could have been in no doubt about the consequences of their actions " on 21/7 .
" These men planned a co-ordinated attack on the London transport system .
Over many months they designed and built their own bombs .
" While the implementation of their plan was incompetent , their aim was clear .
They wanted to kill and maim on a massive scale . "
She said they had shown their " brutal intent " because they had seen what had happened on 7/7 but continued with their plan .
Ms Hemming also confirmed the CPS intended to seek a retrial for conspiracy to murder against Adel Yahya and Manfo Kwaku Asiedu , adding that they were only accused of the offences and had a right to a fair trial .
Countdown : Wounded vet calls Limbaugh 's comparison of him to suicide bomber ' repugnant ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 4 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Keith Olbermann reported on Wednesday 's Countdown that Rush Limbaugh has responded to criticism of his remark describing anti-war veterans as " phony soldiers " by comparing a real soldier who criticized him to a suicide bomber .
After Limbaugh 's initial statement -- which he now claims was taken out of context -- Sgt. Brian McGough , a wounded combat veteran , appeared in a VoteVets.org ad saying that many troops in Iraq " believe George Bush 's military policy has been a disaster " and telling Limbaugh , " Until you have the guts to call me a phony soldier to my face stop telling lies about my service . "
Limbaugh 's response to the VoteVets ad -- which he admitted he had n't seen -- was to call it " a blatant use of a valiant combat veteran , lying to him about what I said and then strapping those lies to his belt , sending him out in the media ...
Whoever pumped him full of these lies about what I said and embarrassed him with this tv ad has betrayed him . "
Olbermann then welcomed McGough to his program to address Limbaugh 's comparison of him to a suicide bomber , noting that Limbaugh had not been willing to allow McGough on his own show to confront him directly .
McGough -- who served in Kosovo , earned a Bronze Star in Afghanistan , and was seriously wounded in Iraq -- described his initial reaction to Limbaugh 's statement as " disgust " and stated , " I 've seen the after - effects of a suicide bomb .
I 've had friends that were hurt in suicide bombs .
It makes me mad down to a place where I can't even think to describe .
It 's just repugnant . "
McGough further explained that he agreed to do the VoteVets ad because it expressed his own sentiments , and that " for Rush Limbaugh to say that an American soldier like me can't think for myself because I speak out against the Iraq War is preposterous . "
" [ Speaking out ] is my right , that I fought for , I bled for , " McGough asserted .
He also appealed repeatedly for Limbaugh to invite him or any other member of VoteVets.org on his own show to discuss the issue directly .

Anybody who blames record high US gasoline prices on " gouging " at the pump simply reveals their total ignorance of global oil supply and demand fundamentals .
The real reason for high pump prices is the lack of global gasoline supply relative to demand .
Just in the US , overall US refining capacity , at 17 million barrels per day ( mb/d ) , is far below demand at 22 mb/d .
In turn , pump prices are effectively set by import prices .
With strong demand outside the US on the back of global economic growth and a weak dollar , the era of abundant US oil supply augmented by willing international sellers is dead .
If you follow the petroleum markets , or you just want to know what is going on in the world of energy , the weekly reports from the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) are invaluable .
Every Wednesday the EIA releases reports detailing information on petroleum and product inventory levels , imports , prices , refinery utilization , etc .
For those who follow this information , the recent run-up in gasoline prices is not a surprise , as you would have seen it coming .
The price increase is not driven – as certain politicians and consumer groups have indicated – by a renewed willingness on the part of oil companies to gouge consumers .
On that topic , I quote Paul Sankey , of Deutsche Bank , in his Senate testimony on May 15th :
But this essay is not about allegations of price gouging .
I know people have strong opinions on both sides of the matter , and I will leave that debate for another day .
This essay is intended to introduce you to an accessible , easy to understand tool that will help you more clearly understand the fundamentals that affect price and supply at the pump .
In fact , it was largely the information in these reports that led me to start sounding warnings at the first of March that we had potential gasoline supply problems looming this summer .
The roots of the current situation go back to last winter .
After record high prices , demand softened , autumn rolled around , and prices plunged .
Consumers , having become accustomed to gasoline near $ 3/gal , were now looking at prices closer to $ 2/gal .
This spurred record demand .
When refineries started coming down for spring turnarounds , the gasoline drawdown was very steep due to such high demand ( which you could see in the weekly reports ) , and prices were too slow to respond .
So , now prices are trying to make up for lost ground .
The links you want to bookmark , if you want to be more informed about what ’s happening in the world of energy , are :
Text File of Highlights
This is the first report to come out .
It is released at 10:30 a.m. EST each Wednesday .
This is a text file that provides all of the important details , although without the graphics .
But it is a link that I typically click into within 5 minutes of the release of the report each week .
The second link that I read every Wednesday is :
This Week in Petroleum :
This is a comprehensive and graphical look at the trends and developments .
The report is released at 1 p.m. EST , and is primarily written by EIA analyst Doug MacIntyre , who has been making himself available for answering questions following my blog postings on the weekly report .
TWIP 5-16-07
The focus of this week ’s edition of This Week in Petroleum was the gasoline situation .
Some excerpts :
Why are gasoline prices so high ?
Gasoline inventories have recently been drawn down at a dramatic rate to bridge the gap between supply and demand ( see Figure 4 , in the Weekly Petroleum Status Report ( WPSR ) ) .
Over 12 consecutive weeks during February , March , and April , total gasoline inventories declined by a cumulative total of more than 34 million barrels ( 15 percent ) .
This is the sharpest decline in gasoline inventories over a consecutive 12 - week period in EIA ’s recorded historical data .
Is there an end in sight or will gasoline prices continue to rise all summer ?
Although gasoline inventories are expected to remain lower than normal throughout the summer , high prices have encouraged more supply and inventories have increased slightly the last two weeks .
Domestic gasoline production has increased by more than 500,000 barrels per day in the last three weeks and total gasoline imports ( including blending components ) during the week ending May 11 , rose above 1.5 million barrels per day , making that week the fifth highest weekly import volume ever and the highest since last May .
Should imports continue at such levels and more domestic refinery capacity come back online , supplies will improve and wholesale prices could come down .
However , with gasoline inventories likely to remain low all summer , retail prices are expected to remain close to $ 3 per gallon during the entire summer season .
Prices could rise again towards the end of summer if demand surges , as it often does , in late July and August .
Inventory Highlights
I had predicted that this week would see a build , but it would fall short of what we need to stay out of an unprecedented Memorial Day inventory situation .
I was correct on both counts :
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories ( excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ) rose by 1.0 million barrels compared to the previous week .
At 342.2 million barrels , U.S. crude oil inventories are just below the upper end of the average range for this time of year .
Total motor gasoline inventories climbed by 1.7 million barrels last week , but remain well below the lower end of the average range .
Distillate fuel inventories increased by 1.0 million barrels per day , and are at the upper end of the average range for this time of year .
We now have 2 weeks in which to gain ( 200.7 - 195.2 ) , or 5.5 million barrels , else we set a record low for Memorial Day .
So we will need to average 2.75 million barrels each of the next two weeks .
Impossible ?
No. Unlikely ?
Yes .
The significance ?
I have been kicking that around .
We could get off with no real problems , other than higher prices .
What these low inventory levels do is increase the level of risk in case of an emergency of some sort .
If a hurricane shuts down major production , we could see gas outages and a very fast run-up in gasoline prices .
Time will tell whether we luck out this summer .
Best to keep your tanks topped off this summer , especially if you live in a hurricane prone area .
Pre-Release Information
The above section was written following the release of the report .
The following section was written prior to the release , and details the hole we have dug .
---------------------
I will update this as soon as this week 's report is released .
But as I await the report , I wondered just how far we have to go to dig ourselves out of the hole we are currently in on gasoline inventories .
Last week 's report showed gasoline stocks at 193.5 million barrels .
Just eyeballing the gasoline inventory graph , the 5 - year average for gasoline on Memorial Day - the traditional start of summer driving season - ranges from a low of 208 million barrels to a high of 218 million barrels .
Counting last week 's numbers , which will be reported in today 's This Week in Petroleum ( TWIP ) , we have 3 weeks to get back to the lower end of the range .
That would require a weekly build of ( 208 - 193.5 ) / 3 , or 4.8 million barrels a week .
Impossible ?
No , but it looks unlikely .
The largest weekly gain that was ever recorded happened the week of May 28th in 1993 .
The increase in gasoline stocks that week was 11.5 million barrels .
That appears to be quite an anomaly , because the next highest May increase was in 1994 at 5.6 million barrels .
If we only look at the data since 2000 – which would be more in line with the current supply / demand picture – the largest May gain occurred in 2001 at 4.3 million barrels .
So , in order to avoid going into the summer driving season below the lower end of the range , we would have to see 3 consecutive weekly gains that have not been seen this century - fueled by very strong import levels ( or record - breaking demand destruction ) .
So , again I go out on a little limb and say that we will enter summer driving season below the bottom of the average range .
If we have an uneventful summer , prices may not go too much higher .
But in my opinion we will go through the summer about one gulf hurricane away from nationwide average gasoline prices rushing past $ 4 / gallon .
They could go much higher in the event of a major refinery disruption ala Hurricane Katrina .
It is really hard to imagine where gasoline prices could top out given current inventory levels .
Going for a Record ?
To put the matter in a bit more perspective , here are the Memorial Day gasoline inventory levels since 1990 .
Date Vol ( million bbl ) May 25 , 1990 218.5 May 31 , 1991 215.7 May 29 , 1992 218.0 May 28 , 1993 229.9 May 27 , 1994 214.4 May 26 , 1995 210.0 May 31 , 1996 206.1 May 30 , 1997 200.7 May 29 , 1998 218.2 May 28 , 1999 223.0 May 26 , 2000 201.1 May 25 , 2001 208.0 May 31 , 2002 215.9 May 30 , 2003 207.3 May 28 , 2004 204.3 May 27 , 2005 216.7 May 26 , 2006 209.3
Table 1 . End of May Gasoline Inventories since 1990
The lowest number on the list is 1997 at 200.7 million barrels .
Even to reach that number , we would have to gain ( 200.7 - 193.5 ) / 3 , or 2.4 million barrels for the next 3 weeks ( 7.2 million barrels total ) .
And while I think we are likely to see a gain in inventories this week as higher prices continue to bite into demand , we are n't likely to gain 7.2 million barrels over the next 3 weeks .
So , again I go out on a limb and say we will hit Memorial Day with record low inventory levels .
How TWIP is Written
I recently asked Doug MacIntyre how he goes about writing TWIP .
Here was his response :
Actually , I wish I knew sometimes .
As a write this comment , it 's Tuesday afternoon and I have NO idea what my hook or topic will be ( although gasoline does seem to be an obvious choice , not every report can be on gasoline ) .
Sometimes it is mostly written by Tuesday , but most of the time , not a word has been written until Wednesday morning , plus I have to wait until I write those pithy 4 paragraphs of text that gets released with the data at 10:30 am ET !
Often , the issues that take the least amount of time seem to be the ones I like the best .
Anyway , right now , I 'm at a blank for what tomorrow 's edition will be .
BTW , while I write the vast majority of them , I have some colleagues that pitch in every now and then , which I truly appreciate !
I told him he could always write about the blogger who had the amazing foresight months ago to start warning of potential record gasoline prices - based on his weekly reading of TWIP and the EIA statistics . :-)
On a more serious note , I have suggested that he devote an upcoming version to the subject of imports : where they come from , how long it takes them to reach our shores , etc .

House Democrats to join Senate in seeking ' no confidence ' vote on Attorney General Michael Roston
Published : Friday May 18 , 2007 Print This Email This Two Democrats in the House of Representatives will join their colleagues in the Senate and seek a vote of no confidence against Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , RAW STORY has learned late on Friday .
" It is our belief that Congress and the American people have lost confidence in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , and the Congress should formally express no confidence in his continued tenure as the head of the Department of Justice , " wrote Reps .
Adam Schiff ( D - CA ) and Artur Davis ( D - AL ) in a so - called " Dear Colleague " letter to other Members of Congress .
They added , " Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has failed to adequately and properly manage the Department of Justice and faithfully execute the duties of his office , as reflected in his mismanagement of the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys , the conflicting and incomplete testimony before Congress by the Attorney General regarding his actions , and his demonstrated inability to reassure the public that our laws are being enforced in a nonpartisan , judicious manner . "
Reached for comment late in the day , an aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the she has not yet seen the particular measure proposed by Schiff and Davis .
But the Speaker had already expressed her desire to see the Attorney General step down in March .
" She 's asked Gonzales to resign two months ago , " Nadeam Elshami , a spokesman for Rep. Pelosi told RAW STORY .
" What 's important here is to understand that while Congress has an important role to play , it 's the President 's responsibility to act for the American people , and if the Attorney General has lost their confidence , the President should heed that call . "
Schiff and Davis 's plan followed on that of Senators Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) and Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , who announced similar intentions on Thursday .
The text of the letter is presented below .
# Dear Colleague : As former Assistant United States Attorneys , with a combined 10 years of experience as prosecutors in the Department of Justice , we have lost confidence in the ability of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to lead the Department .
Next week , we will introduce a resolution expressing no confidence in the performance of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , and urging the President to request his resignation .
At this critical time in our Nation 's history , when we confront unprecedented challenges posed by global terrorism , and when public confidence in our justice system is a necessity , our country must have the service of an Attorney General who has the full confidence of the American people to enforce the law , defend the United States from threats foreign and domestic , prevent crime and seek punishment for those guilty , and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has failed to adequately and properly manage the Department of Justice and faithfully execute the duties of his office , as reflected in his mismanagement of the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys , the conflicting and incomplete testimony before Congress by the Attorney General regarding his actions , and his demonstrated inability to reassure the public that our laws are being enforced in a nonpartisan , judicious manner .
It is our belief that Congress and the American people have lost confidence in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , and the Congress should formally express no confidence in his continued tenure as the head of the Department of Justice .
Sincerely ,
Sebastian K.'s first encounter with Megan – a programmer in the company ’s data verification department – came in the form of an innocent - sounding question : “ how do I get the first value out of a variable ? ”
Having no idea what she was talking about , Sebastian inquired a bit further .
Her code looked something like this :
i Result := agg_sum ( ' rec-a ' , 0.11 ) ; ... snip ... i Result := rlt_amtd( iAppNum ) * 100 ;
“ See , ” Megan explained , pointing to the first line of code , “ over here , I ’m putting in the result of the first calculation , and then here I ’m putting in the second result .
But I need them both to do the deduction .
So how do I get back the first value ? ”
Sebastian was n’t quite sure how to respond .
After all , Megan was responsible for developing several applications that were used by the data verification folks , and certainly could n’t be asking such a basic programming question !
He carefully replied , “ Well , it looks like your iResult variable is getting overwritten by the second call here … ”
Somewhat confused , Megan replied “ so how do I fix that ? ”
Afraid that he might be insulting , Sebastian hesitantly took the keyboard and made a minor code change .
iAggResult := agg_sum ( ' rec-a ' , 0.11 ) ; ... snip ... iRltResult := rlt_amtd( iAppNum ) * 100 ;
“ Oh , ” she said , “ I did n’t know you could do that ! ”
Having found her go - to guy for programming help , Megan inquired with Sebastian about some difficulty she was having with a query .
Sebastian took a look to see why …
SELECT * FROM ( SELECT * FROM APPL WHERE APPRCVD IS NOT NULL UNION SELECT * FROM APPL WHERE APPRCVD IS NULL )
Apparently , she wanted all rows , regardless of whether APPRCVD was null or not .
When Sebastian explained that this would happen without a WHERE clause , she replied “ I did n’t know you could do that ! ”
The following week , she called Sebastian over to help with her latest issue : errors about too many open cursors .
A quick look at the code and it was pretty obvious why .
open myCursor ( Id ) ; fetch myCursor into vrow ; if myCursor % NOTFOUND then pReturnMsg := ' Application Not Found ' ; return True ; end if ; close myCursor ;
Sebastian explained that it was important to close cursors after use .
“ But I ’m doing that right here , ” Megan said , pointing to the last line of the function .
Sebastian further explained that the “ return True ” line caused the function to exit and not execute any lines below it .
“ Huh , ” Megan replied , surprised , “ I never knew that !
That would explain a lot .
I did n’t know you could do that ! ”
Over the next few months , Sebastian learned pretty quickly that “ I did n’t know you could do that ! ” was Megan ’s catchphrase .
Fortunately , with all the programming help and tips , Megan started relying less and less on Sebastian .
In fact , she had done so well that she was asked to help on other projects .
Previously , Megan ’s code tended to be of the wrong - but - mostly - harmless category , but her new code approached wrong - and - very - freaking - dangerous .
Namely , she ’d released an Oracle Forms application to production in which none of the fields were databound .
As such , any data submitted would never get recorded .
And it took them over two months to discover and fix this bug .
Once that was resolved , Megan went on to work on another application that updated several tables via a trigger .
The only problem was that she forgot to add a WHERE clause to the trigger ’s UPDATE query .
Yes , every row of every table touched by the trigger would be updated every time the trigger fired .
So with all the screwups and bad data , the company responded appropriately .
By promoting Megan to the Lead Developer for the whole department .

Safe products are one of those things it ’s hard to create any kind of meaningful opposition against .
You can argue ( rightly or wrongly ) about the Iraq war , or changing immigration law , or universal health insurance–but who can honestly say they oppose ensuring that our kids ’ toys are safe to play with , that our food is safe to eat , and that our everyday products are safe to use ?
Well , apparently , the Bush regime can , if the actions of current Consumer Product Safety Commission head Nancy Nord are any indication .
Nord is on record as opposing new legislation that would increase her agency ’s budget , improve its oversight and enforcement powers , and strengthen penalties for companies that sell recalled or dangerous products .
That ’s such a Bizarro World stance that I have to say it again –Congress wants to beef up an agency that has been crippled by budget cuts and indolent , corrupt leadership , and the agency head is against it .
Thankfully , the Senate has chosen to ignore her opposition , and the Commerce Committee unanimously passed the Consumer Product Safety
Act of 2007 yesterday , with the next step being a full vote in the Senate .
Similar legislation is on its way in the House , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday called for Nord to step down :
â€ œIn a letter just last week , the chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission , Nancy Nord , said she was opposed to increasing the agencyâ€™s funding or authority .
One person assigned to testing toys to ensure that they are safe , and the Chairman of the Commission saying she is opposed to expanding the authority or the funding .
â€ œThat is not what American parents want to hear .
They want to know that we are doing all we can to ensure that safe toys , safe food , and safe medicine are available for our children . ”
Yesterday the Campaign For America ’s Future published a new report tracing the parallel courses of American business ’ increased reliance on overseas product manufacturing , and the evisceration of regulations and oversight to protect consumers and ensure product safety .
The report paints a chilling picture of how the Reagan administration began killing the CPSC through the death of a thousand budget cuts , even as our country ’s manufacturing base disappeared and was sent overseas in the name of low prices .
The end result ?
Crappy , unsafe toys and products that endanger our kids and ourselves .
I covered the report ’s release in a conference call that included Senator Sherrod Brown ( co-sponsor of the Senate bill ) , Representative Rosa DeLauro ( co-sponsor of the House legislation ) , David Sirota , CAF co-chair Robert Borosage , and Marilyn Furer , who provided a poignant “ ordinary Jane ” perspective on how unsafe toys and products can cause lasting harm to children .
Furer told stories of how she tested her own grandchildren ’s toys for lead contamination and how aghast she was that an important agency such as the CPSC was left to be run by political hacks appointed by the President , while Brown and DeLauro angrily reiterated calls for Nord ’s resignation .
But the problem goes back further and deeper than Nord–Nord only stepped in because Bush ’s original pick , Michael Baroody , was such an outspoken opponent of consumers ’ rights that the Senate would n’t even touch him .
And Baroody , in turn , was originally slotted to succeed Hal Stratton , who was largely keeping the seat warm while waiting to find a more lucrative private - sector job .
And all of this is symptomatic of the Bush regime ’s utter lack of concern for the safety and security of the people it ’s spending billions in a pointless war to protect .
There ’s nothing more immediate and looming in the minds of the middle class than ensuring their children are safe .
And while we continue to foment hysteria about al - Qaeda lurking in the bushes or Iran suddenly nuking us all from orbit , our children are under assault from a barrage of dangerous , unsafe products that can harm or even kill–and that ’s even before addressing the recalls of foods too dangerous for humans or pets to eat !
Any smart Democrat will jump right on this issue and make it a wedge for a campaign –because just like Bush and the Republicans demonstrated with SCHIP , the war on consumer safety is a clear sign that in Bush ’s America , you ’re on your own , and there ’s nothing you can do about it .
And our families deserve better than that .
Brought to you by Brave New Films and TheREALRudy.org , here are seven minutes of video that will cure you of any delusions about Rudy Giuliani being the " hero " of 9/11 .
The bottom line is that Rudy 's idiocy cost us more lives on 9/11 .
And in this world turned upside down , he 's campaigning as though his record on that score were something to be proud of .
People who were serious about trying to save lives on 9/11 -- like actual New York Firefighters -- hate this lying jackass , because his venality killed their friends , and his campaign 's very existence spits on their graves .
Have a nice day .
Leahy , Specter suggest Justice Department investigator probe Attorney General 's conduct Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 6 , 2007 Print This Email This
The top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee have written to the Justice Department 's Inspector General seeking an expansion of an internal investigation to cover the possibility that the Attorney General may have interfered with the subsequent testimony of former top aide Monica Goodling .
Goodling described herself as ' not comfortable ' with a conversation the Attorney General initiated with her .
" [ Goodling ] testified that Mr. Gonzales recounted to her his recollection of the process leading up to and including the firing and replacement of several U.S. Attorneys , " wrote Senators Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Judiciary Committee Chairman , and Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , the Ranking Republican on the committee .
" Ms. Goodling 's testimony prompted Congressman Davis to ask whether the Attorney General was engaged in inappropriately communicating with someone he knew was a participant in and witness to the matters under investigation in order to shape her testimony . "
In the letter to Glenn Fine , the Justice Department 's Inspector General , they went on , " Although you mentioned the expansion of your inquiry with respect to the consideration in hiring decisions of improper political considerations , you did not mention this incident in your recent letter .
Does the expansion of your inquiry include this matter ? "
The full letter can be read at Senator Leahy 's website .
In her May 23 appearance at the House Judiciary Committee , Goodling admitted that Gonzales had discussed his understanding of the process that led to the firing of 8 US Attorneys with her in a meeting on March 15 .
She worried that the conversation was not legally appropriate .
" I did not know if it was appropriate for us to both be discussing our recollections of what had happened , and I just thought maybe we should n't have that conversation , " she told Rep. Artur Davis ( D - AL ) .
Last Friday , RAW STORY reported that Goodling had appeared to suggest the Attorney General continued to discuss the process by which the Attorneys were fired after an internal investigation had been launched by the Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility during the week of March 19 .
The Office of the Inspector General was later brought on board to join in the investigation .
Gonzales has repeatedly insisted in public appearances , including Congressional testimony , that he was not able to answer certain questions because seeking the answers might result in interference with the Justice Department 's internal investigation .
" I have n't talked to witnesses because of the fact that I have n't wanted to interfere with this investigation and department investigations , " he told Senator Charles Grassley ( R - IA ) in his April 19 appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The US today said it would allow the release of footage to a coroner 's inquiry that shows a US air attack on a British military convoy in Iraq .
The Pentagon had previously refused permission for the tape to be shown at the inquest into the death of Lance Corporal Matty Hull , despite the demands of British coroner Andrew Walker to the Ministry of Defence .
Its U - turn follows the leaking of the footage today .
A transcript of the cockpit video records the US pilot and another on the same mission swearing and possibly weeping after they realise they have attacked friendly forces .
" I 'm going to be sick , " one says on being told that the attack has killed a coalition soldier .
He adds : " We 're in jail , dude . "
The two US A - 10 jet pilots were both believed to be reservists with no previous combat experience at the time of the attack on March 28 2003 .
The Sun , who obtained the video , identified them as POPOV36 , a lieutenant colonel , and POPOV35 , a major .
The defence secretary , Des Browne , welcomed the decision to allow the coroner and the Hull family to view the video .
" The release of classified information , even for the closest of allies , is never straightforward , but this is the right thing to do , " he said .
" I recognise that this must have been distressing for the Hull family , and I 'm glad that we have been able to resolve it . "
Earlier today , the coroner 's office said the Sun had promised to give Mr Walker a copy of the tape and would use it in court if the newspaper did so .
" This material is now in the public domain , and that means that it can be used in the Matty Hull inquest , " a spokesman said .
Lance Corporal
Hull died in a burning armoured vehicle three days before his 26th birthday after the US planes opened fire on a Household Cavalry Regiment patrol near Basra , southern Iraq .
Four other British soldiers were injured .
The MoD refused to comment on the contents of the tape , which appears to show that one of the primary mistakes was made by US ground controllers , who assured the pilots there were no " friendly " patrols in the area .
The Sun said the two pilots were on a mission to destroy Iraqi artillery and rocket launchers north of Basra , and were circling at an altitude of 3,500 metres ( 11,480 ft ) when they saw Iraqi vehicles and a British patrol .
As the pair looked at the British convoy , POPOV36 twice said he thought he could see orange panels on the vehicles - an indication of coalition forces .
But after a ground controller assured the pilots they were " well clear of friendlies " , POPOV36 decided the orange panels were most likely to be rocket launchers and opened fire , with his colleague saying : " Get him , get him . "
POPOV36 apparently saw wounded soldiers being dragged from the burning vehicles , and said : " It looks like he is hauling arse .
Ha ha . "
The pilots were then told by ground controllers that there were , in fact , " friendly " light tanks in the area , prompting a volley of swearing .
They asked another ground controller about the fate of the convoy , and were told one person was dead and another had been injured .
" I 'm going to be sick , " POPOV35 said , while his colleague swore again and made a crying sound .
" Did you hear ? " asked POPOV35 , getting the reply : " Yeah , this sucks " .
POPOV35 then said : " We 're in jail , dude . "
Lance Corporal
Hull 's family have said they were initially told no such tape existed .
It first came to light when Mr Walker said he had been handed a copy and wanted to play it before the hearing .
On Friday , after an initial deadline for the MoD to get permission to use the tape had passed , Mr Walker adjourned the inquest until March 12 and gave the ministry a week to confirm it would allow the tape to be played .
MoD officials said they had not been able to get permission from US authorities to release the classified tape .
The constitutional affairs minister , Harriet Harman , who called last week for US authorities to help the inquest in any way they could , today pointedly refused to condemn the leaking of the tape .
Asked whether it was right to leak the recording , she said : " I have always taken the view that what is important is that the families get all the information available to help them understand what happened . "
Ms Harman has held a series of meetings with the US embassy 's deputy chief of mission , David Johnson , to urge that the tape be approved for use at the inquest .
Asked earlier today why Washington had so far refused this , Mr Johnson said US soldiers were sent into combat under " a set of predictable laws which are established before the fact " .
" One thing I want to make very clear is our heart goes out to this family , " he told Radio 4 's Today programme .
" This is an extraordinary tragedy that they have endured and we are very sorry for what has happened .
" But I think that does not take away from the need to have a body of law which is followed and a set of expectations we can have our combat forces - yours and ours - go by when they go into battle . "
To Kelby Jasmon , there was only one answer .
The question :
If he received yet another concussion this football season , while playing offensive and defensive line for his high school in Springfield , Ill. , would he tell a coach or trainer ?
Jasmon , with his battering - ram , freshly buzz - cut head and eyes that danced with impending glory , immediately answered : “ No chance .
It ’s not dangerous to play with a concussion .
You ’ve got to sacrifice for the sake of the team .
The only way I come out is on a stretcher . ”
Jasmon , a senior with three concussions on his résumé , looked at two teammates for support and unity .
They said the same thing with the same certainty :
They did not quite know what a concussion was , and would never tell their coaches if they believed they had sustained one .
Matt Selvaggio , who plays with Jasmon on both lines , said : “ Our coaches would take us out in a second .
So why would we tell them ? ”
Whether you ’re trying to solve a tough problem , start a business , get attention for that business , or write an interesting article , creative thinking is crucial .
The process boils down to changing your perspective and seeing things differently than you currently do .
People like to call this “ thinking outside of the box , ” but that ’s the wrong way to look at it .
Just like Neo needed to understand that “ there is no spoon ” in the film The Matrix , you need to realize “ there is no box ” to step outside of .
You create your own imaginary boxes simply by living life and accepting certain things as “ real ” when they are just as illusory as the beliefs of a paranoid delusional .
The difference is , enough people agree that certain man-made concepts are “ real , ” so you ’re viewed as “ normal . ”
This is good for society overall , but it ’s that sort of unquestioning consensus that inhibits your natural creative abilities .
So , rather than looking for ways to inspire creativity , you should just realize the truth .
You ’re already capable of creative thinking at all times , but you have to strip away the imaginary mental blocks ( or boxes ) you ’ve picked up along the way to wherever you are today .
I like to keep this list of 10 common ways we suppress our natural creative abilities nearby when I get stuck .
It helps me realize that the barriers to a good idea are truly all in my head .
1. Trying to find the “ right ” answer
One of the worst aspects of formal education is the focus on the correct answer to a particular question or problem .
While this approach helps us function in society , it hurts creative thinking because real - life issues are ambiguous .
There ’s often more than one “ correct ” answer , and the second one you come up with might be better than the first .
Many of the following mental blocks can be turned around to reveal ways to find more than one answer to any given problem .
Try reframing the issue in several different ways in order to prompt different answers and embrace answering inherently ambiguous questions in several different ways .
2. Logical thinking
Not only is real life ambiguous , it ’s often illogical to the point of madness .
While critical thinking skills based on logic are one of our main strengths in evaluating the feasibility of a creative idea , it ’s often the enemy of truly innovative thoughts in the first place .
One of the best ways to escape the constraints of your own logical mind is to think metaphorically .
One of the reasons why metaphors work so well is that we accept them as true without thinking about it .
When you realize that “ truth ” is often symbolic , you ’ll often find that you are actually free to come up with alternatives .
3. Following rules
One way to view creative thinking is to look at it as a destructive force .
You ’re tearing away the often arbitrary rules that others have set for you , and asking either “ why ” or “ why not ” whenever confronted with the way “ everyone ” does things .
This is easier said than done , since people will often defend the rules they follow even in the face of evidence that the rule does n’t work .
People love to celebrate rebels like Richard Branson , but few seem brave enough to emulate him .
Quit worshipping rule breakers and start breaking some rules .
4. Being practical
Like logic , practicality is hugely important when it comes to execution , but often stifles innovative ideas before they can properly blossom .
Do n’t allow the editor into the same room with your inner artist .
Try not to evaluate the actual feasibility of an approach until you ’ve allowed it to exist on its own for a bit .
Spend time asking “ what if ” as often as possible , and simply allow your imagination to go where it wants .
You might just find yourself discovering a crazy idea that ’s so insanely practical that no one ’s thought of it before .
5 . Play is not work
Allowing your mind to be at play is perhaps the most effective way to stimulate creative thinking , and yet many people disassociate play from work .
These days , the people who can come up with great ideas and solutions are the most economically rewarded , while worker bees are often employed for the benefit of the creative thinkers .
You ’ve heard the expression “ work hard and play hard . ”
All you have to realize is that they ’re the same thing to a creative thinker .
6 . That ’s not my job
In an era of hyper - specialization , it ’s those who happily explore completely unrelated areas of life and knowledge who best see that everything is related .
This goes back to what ad man Carl Ally said about creative persons — they want to be know - it - alls .
Sure , you ’ve got to know the specialized stuff in your field , but if you view yourself as an explorer rather than a highly specialized cog in the machine , you ’ll run circles around the technical master in the success department .
7. Being a “ serious ” person
Most of what keeps us civilized boils down to conformity , consistency , shared values , and yes , thinking about things the same way everyone else does .
There ’s nothing wrong with that necessarily , but if you can mentally accept that it ’s actually nothing more than groupthink that helps a society function , you can then give yourself permission to turn everything that ’s accepted upside down and shake out the illusions .
Leaders from Egyptian pharaohs to Chinese emperors and European royalty have consulted with fools , or court jesters , when faced with tough problems .
The persona of the fool allowed the truth to be told , without the usual ramifications that might come with speaking blasphemy or challenging ingrained social conventions .
Give yourself permission to be a fool and see things for what they really are .
8. Avoiding ambiguity
We rationally realize that most every situation is ambiguous to some degree .
And although dividing complex situations into black and white boxes can lead to disaster , we still do it .
It ’s an innate characteristic of human psychology to desire certainty , but it ’s the creative thinker who rejects the false comfort of clarity when it ’s not really appropriate .
Ambiguity is your friend if you ’re looking to innovate .
The fact that most people are uncomfortable exploring uncertainty gives you an advantage , as long as you can embrace ambiguity rather than run from it .
9 . Being wrong is bad
We hate being wrong , and yet mistakes often teach us the most .
Thomas Edison was wrong over 1,000 times before getting the light bulb right .
Edison ’s greatest strength was that he was not afraid to be wrong .
The best thing we do is learn from our mistakes , but we have to free ourselves to make mistakes in the first place .
Just try out your ideas and see what happens , take what you learn , and try something else .
Ask yourself , what ’s the worst that can happen if I ’m wrong ?
You ’ll often find the benefits of being wrong greatly outweigh the ramifications .
10 . I ’m not creative
Denying your own creativity is like denying you ’re a human being .
We ’re all limitlessly creative , but only to the extent that we realize that we create our own limits with the way we think .
If you tell yourself you ’re not creative , it becomes true .
Stop that .
In that sense , awakening your own creativity is similar to the path reported by those who seek spiritual enlightenment .
You ’re already enlightened , just like you ’re already creative , but you have to strip away all of your delusions before you can see it .
Acknowledge that you ’re inherently creative , and then start tearing down the other barriers you ’ve allowed to be created in your mind .
In the unceasing feud between the RIAA and satellite radio , the agency has rekindled the fire by encouraging the FCC to " require the merged companies to pay higher royalty rates to the record industry . "
Reportedly , the RIAA argued that the firms were " no longer new , struggling companies that could get away with paying below - market rates , " and further salted the wound by insisting that the FCC " make clear that its approval of a merger was conditioned upon the continued protection of sound recordings from unlawful infringement . "
Of course , a number of senators have already voiced their concern for more limitations on satellite radio streams , but unsurprisingly , it seems like the RIAA wants these lofty wishes to become reality ( and in a hurry ) .

The stories of the 52 people who lost their lives in the London bombings of 7 July 2005 .
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News website
With its Geo - 4 report , the United Nations tells us that most aspects of the Earth 's natural environment are in decline ; and that the decline will affect us , the planet 's human inhabitants , in some pretty important ways .
Geo - 4 provides a check - up on the health of the planet
Feel like you have heard it before ?
Of course you have , not least from the UN .
So what , you might ask , is special about this report ?
Why is it worth any more than a cursory headline glance before returning to the party ?
Well , first there is the sheer scale .
Hundreds of researchers from a huge variety of disciplines have compiled , written and analysed its 572 pages ; thousands more have reviewed the various chapters .
Second , Geo - 4 covers the whole range of environmental issues , and the links between them .
In these climate - obsessed times , it is often forgotten that issues like forestry , fresh water supplies , agriculture , biodiversity , and the spread of desert land all connect to each other and to climate change .

Third , it explores the links between social trends and environmental decline in a way that is not often done .
Which other body , for example , asks whether the divergence we are seeing in the wealth of the richest and the poorest is good or bad for the environment ?
And fourth , it is a staging post on a journey which in principle the international community embarked upon 20 years ago ; a chance to see how far society has come , and in which direction .
Sustainable commitment
1987 was perhaps the year when the international community , through the United Nations , began to sound as though it were serious about the environment .
Our Common Future contained fine words , and fine sentiments ; Geo - 4 suggests they have not been acted upon

It was the year that the World Commission on Environment and Development , chaired by the then Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland , delivered the gospel of sustainability .
When Mrs Brundtland presented the commission 's conclusions to the UN General Assembly , in the form of a report entitled Our Common Future , they were well received .
The assembled governments declared they were " concerned about the accelerating deterioration of the human environment and natural resources and the consequences of that deterioration for economic and social development " .
They agreed that sustainable development - by which they meant " meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs " - should become a central guiding principle of the UN itself , as well as its member governments .
They called upon governments - ie themselves - to " ensure that their policies , programmes and budgets encourage sustainable development " .
Officially , it was now acknowledged that environmental protection and human development were inextricably linked ; there could be no sustainable economic development without environmental protection , and no sustained environmental protection without equitable economic development .
The Brundtland Report set the scene for the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit five years later , which would deliver more specific global commitments on climate , biodiversity , desertification and forests , turning the commission 's broad vision into narrower objectives , more measurable and so - perhaps - more achievable .
Our Common Future contained fine words , and fine sentiments ; Geo - 4 suggests they have not been acted upon .
Nature 's poor
Almost everywhere it looks , Geo - 4 finds evidence of decline in the years since .
Rivers - the lifeblood for millions - continue to be polluted and exploited
From over - fishing and pollution in the oceans to climate - changing emissions in the atmosphere , it concludes that pretty much everything is going downhill .
More greenhouse gases , more widespread pollution , declining availability of fresh water , deforestation , degradation of farmland , ocean acidification - it is hard to come up with a more comprehensive and , frankly , a more depressing list .
Yet humans are living longer ; and in most parts of the world , living standards are higher .
Unep calculates that per-capita GDP has gone up from close to $ 6,000 to just over $ 8,000 over the last 20 years .
So what , you might ask , is the problem ?
Marine fish stocks provide perhaps the clearest example .
Three - quarters of marine fisheries are exploited up to , or beyond , their maximum capacity .
Today 's industrial - scale fleets deploy giant nets which could fit a phalanx of jumbo jets through their mouths , they use sonar to find shoals of fish and GPS to locate fertile fishing grounds .
Yet they are finding less and less to catch , because there is less and less there ; eventually , there may be nothing at all worth hunting .
Oceans may not be able to meet the needs of future generations
There could be no clearer example of a society engaged in unsustainable development ; a society that is " meeting the needs of the present " , but in doing so is very definitely " compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs " .
Humans might be living longer and richer lives now , this implies ; but environmental degradation must at some point curb or even reverse the trend .
To use the jargon , the world 's store of financial capital is rising at the expense of its natural capital , the bits of nature that humans rely on to provide food and water and to re-process our waste .
It finds that the unsustainable label sticks to everything examined by Mrs Brundtland 's team : " There are no major issues raised in Our Common Future for which the foreseeable trends are favourable " .
Growing concerns
Since Brundtland , the world 's human population has increased by 34 % ; although the rate of growth is slowing , it is a long way from stabilisation .
A larger population needs more land to live on and grow food , hence causing more deforestation and more encroachment into areas previously left for nature .
It means extracting more water for drinking , industry and agriculture ; more energy use and greenhouse gas emissions .
Brundtland suggested developing policies that simultaneously aimed to restrain population growth while reducing both poverty and environmental destruction .
If that was ever feasible , politicians and their advisors now generally consider population growth such a sensitive issue that it has virtually disappeared off the sustainability radar .
By pointing out that global population growth is a significant environmental issue , Geo - 4 might just encourage politicians to bring it back out of the closet , so that it can at least be discussed again .
Human salvation ?
Sustainable development is not the easiest concept to catch up with ; certainly it is much harder for a government to measure whether greenhouse gas emissions are rising , or whether economic growth is accelerating than to evaluate whether its overall policy portfolio is sustainable .
Jonathon Porritt has argued on this website that sustainable development is not just a " boring catch - phrase " , but the key to a better future for humankind and the natural world .
As he also argued , there has never been more talk about it ; in fact , if a tree were planted every time a modern European politician uttered the SD - phrase , loss of forest would probably be a thing of the past .
Geo - 4 shows us that if 20 post - Brundtland years have upped the rhetoric , they have done little to change the reality ; despite a plethora of good intentions , global society is less sustainable than ever .
Without major changes in direction , we had better hope that the people who believe that human ingenuity , technology and economic growth will always solve our future problems turn out to be right .

Back to School : Five Myths about Girls and Science
New resources for parents and teachers can help students be successful in math and science
Participants in InSTEP , part of NSF 's Graduate Fellowships in K - 12 Education , work together in lab .
August 27 , 2007
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
The National Science Foundation 's ( NSF ) Research on Gender in Science and Engineering ( GSE ) program seeks to broaden the participation of girls and women in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) education fields by supporting research , the diffusion of research - based innovations , and extension services in education that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic science and engineering workforce .
Though the program 's name has changed over the years , it has been supporting these objectives since 1993 , and its work has led to real changes in the opportunities available for girls and women to participate in the study of science , technology , engineering and math .
" We know a great deal about where the challenges and opportunities are , " says Jolene Kay Jesse , program director for GSE .
" There are helpful strategies for teachers and for families to attract girls to science and keep them engaged in it .
And , by the way , these strategies are helpful in keeping students of both genders engaged . "
Following are five myths about girls and science .
1. Myth : From the time they start school , most girls are less interested in science than boys are .
Reality :
In elementary school about as many girls as boys have positive attitudes toward science .
A recent study of fourth graders showed that 66 percent of girls and 68 percent of boys reported liking science .
But something else starts happening in elementary school .
By second grade , when students ( both boys and girls ) are asked to draw a scientist , most portray a white male in a lab coat .
The drawings generally show an isolated person with a beaker or test tube .
Any woman scientist they draw looks severe and not very happy .
The persistence of the stereotypes start to turn girls off , and by eighth grade , boys are twice as interested in STEM careers as girls are .
The female attrition continues throughout high school , college , and even the work force .
Women with STEM higher education degrees are twice as likely to leave a scientific or engineering job as men with comparable STEM degrees .
2. Myth : Classroom interventions that work to increase girls ' interest in STEM run the risk of turning off the boys .
Reality : Actually , educators have found that interventions that work to increase girls ' interest in STEM also increase such interest among the boys in the classroom .
When girls are shown images of women scientists and given a greater sense of possibility about the person they could become , the boys get the message too --" I can do this ! "
There are more opportunities than ever for girls and boys to explore science together .
One resource : the discoveries , games and hands - on experiments available at http://pbskids.org/dragonflytv/.
3. Myth : Science and math teachers are no longer biased toward their male students .
Reality :
In fact , biases are persistent , and teachers often interact more with boys than with girls in science and math .
A teacher will often help a boy do an experiment by explaining how to do it , while when a girl asks for assistance the teacher will often simply do the experiment , leaving the girl to watch rather than do .
Research shows that when teachers are deliberate about taking steps to involve the female students , everyone winds up benefiting .
This may mean making sure everyone in the class is called on over the course of a particular lesson , or asking a question and waiting 10 seconds before calling on anyone .
Good math and science teachers also recognize that when instruction is inquiry - based and hands - on , and students engage in problem solving as cooperative teams , both boys and girls are motivated to pursue STEM activities , education and careers .
Resisting stereotypes and furthering opportunities , Girls Creating Games was created as an after - school and summer program designed to support the interest of middle school girls in computers and information technology .
Its goal is to increase the number of women and girls in the IT workforce .
A sample of the girls ' creations is accessible at http://programservices.etr.org/gcgweb/.
4. Myth :
When girls just are n't interested in science , parents can't do much to motivate them .
Reality : Parents ' support ( as well as that of teachers ) has been shown to be crucial to a girl 's interest in science , technology , engineering and math .
Making girls aware of the range of science and engineering careers available and their relevance to society works to attract more women ( as well as men ) to STEM careers .
Parents and teachers are also in a position to tell young people what they need to do ( in terms of coursework and grades ) to put themselves on a path to a STEM career .
Best known as the first American woman to travel in space , Sally Ride is also a physicist , educator , and author .
She is the founder of Sally Ride Science , a science content company dedicated to supporting girls ' and boys ' interests in science , math and technology .
She offers a guide for parents , " Science Can Take Her Places " at http://www.sallyridescience.com/.
5. Myth :
At the college level , changing the STEM curriculum runs the risk of watering down important " sink or swim " coursework .
Reality :
The mentality of needing to " weed out " weaker students in college majors -- especially in the more quantitative disciplines -- disproportionately weeds out women .
This is not necessarily because women are failing .
Rather , women often perceive " Bs " as inadequate grades and drop out , while men with " Cs " will persist with the class .
Effective mentoring and " bridge programs " that prepare students for challenging coursework can counteract this .
Changing the curriculum often leads to better recruitment and retention of both women and men in STEM classrooms and majors .
For example , having students work in pairs on programming in entry - level computer science and engineering ( CSE ) courses leads to greater retention of both men and women in CSE majors .
In addition , given that many students ( including men ) have difficulty with spatial visualization and learning , coursework in this area has helped retain both women and men in engineering schools .
One of the most effective interventions to help young women choose and sustain a STEM educational path and subsequent STEM career is mentoring .
MentorNet , a virtual e-mentoring network and community was established in 1997 .
Since then , it has expanded to offer award - winning , research - based , technology - leveraged mentoring programs that pair young people with professionals working in STEM careers in industry , government and higher education .
Structured e-mail based mentoring relationships are sustained over a period of time with both one - on - one encouragement and advice , and online topic - based discussion groups .
A resume database also assists job - seekers .
MentorNet is accessible through http://www.mentornet.net.
***
Two new publications funded by NSF offer some excellent resources .
New Formulas for America 's Workforce 2 : Girls in Science and Engineering is the second volume in a series presenting research about the family , school and social structures that create obstacles or provide opportunities to attract girls and women to the STEM disciplines .
It also presents the results of interventions that have succeeded in overcoming the obstacles and enhancing the opportunities to bring a new population to the sciences .
New Tools for America 's Workforce is a catalog of available resources for educators and others .
The publications are accessible at http://www.nsf.gov/ehr/hrd/Newformulas/newformulas.jsp.
On - line resources included in the New Tools publication are included with each of the myths discussed here .
In spite of many obstacles , women have made significant contributions to the advancement of science throughout history -- from the empress of China who used her scientific abilities to invent silk over 5000 years ago , to the Hollywood glamour queen who patented a missile guidance system that keeps cell phones working today .

I recommend a couple of articles chronicling the unintended consequences of the war on drugs .
One , by Ethan Nadelmann , is a global look at the damage done by prohibitionist policies .
The other , by Radley Balko , is a look at a doctor convicted for prescribing opioids — and this case is in some ways more troubling than the Hurwitz case that I ’ve been writing about .
Dr. Nadelmann ’s article is the cover story of Foreign Policy magazine , which summarizes the article ’s findings with large lettters on the cover : “ Legalize It : Why It ’s Time to Just Say No to Prohibition . ”
Dr. Nadelmann , the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance , shows how America has exported its preoccupation with drugs to the rest of the world , harming other countries and financing terrorists that pose a threat to America .
( Not that this narco - financed threat seems to matter much in Washington .
After 9/11 , Americans were told that we had to revise our assumptions about the world — and about little things like civil liberties — but the drug prohibitionists in Washington do n’t seem to have revised their thinking one whit . )
“ Looking to the United States as a role model for drug control is like looking to apartheid - era South Africa for how to deal with race , ” Dr. Nadelmann writes in detailing the failure of prohibition at home .
After surveying other countries , like Afghanistan , he concludes :
Global drug prohibition is clearly a costly disaster .
The United Nations has estimated the value of the global market in illicit drugs at $ 400 billion , or 6 percent of global trade .
The extraordinary profits available to those willing to assume the risks enrich criminals , terrorists , violent political insurgents , and corrupt politicians and governments .
Many cities , states , and even countries in Latin America , the Caribbean , and Asia are reminiscent of Chicago under Al Capone — times 50 .
By bringing the market for drugs out into the open , legalization would radically change all that for the better .
More importantly , legalization would strip addiction down to what it really is : a health issue .
Most people who use drugs are like the responsible alcohol consumer , causing no harm to themselves or anyone else .
They would no longer be the state ’s business .
But legalization would also benefit those who struggle with drugs by reducing the risks of overdose and disease associated with unregulated products , eliminating the need to obtain drugs from dangerous criminal markets , and allowing addiction problems to be treated as medical rather than criminal problems .
No one knows how much governments spend collectively on failing drug war policies , but it ’s probably at least $ 100 billion a year , with federal , state , and local governments in the United States accounting for almost half the total .
Add to that the tens of billions of dollars to be gained annually in tax revenues from the sale of legalized drugs .
Now imagine if just a third of that total were committed to reducing drug - related disease and addiction .
Virtually everyone , except those who profit or gain politically from the current system , would benefit .
Meanwhile , Radley Balko reports in Reason on the case of Dr. Bernard L. Rottschaefer , a doctor in Pittsburgh who ’s serving a five - year sentence after being convicted of illegally prescribing opioids .
His arrest made headlines when he was accused of trading prescriptions for sex .
But the allegations about sex were made by addicts who cut deals with the Drug Enforcement Administration and prosecutors for reduced sentences in exchange for their testimony , and their stories looked shaky during the trial .
After the trial , as I wrote about in this column , the boyfriend of one of the women produced letters in which she repeatedly confessed to making up the story about sex in order to get a reduced sentence .
Mr. Balko reviews those facts and digs up new evidence that supports Dr. Rottschaefer — and possibly implicates the prosecutors for misconduct .
They persuaded a jury to convict him by claiming his prescriptions were unnecessary and outside the bounds of medicine , and caused damage to the patients .
But the jury did n’t hear evidence that emerged later in civil suits related to the case — and that prosecutors omitted either out of ignorance or malice .
As Mr. Balko explains :
It ’s now clear that all five women perjured themselves in Rottschaefer ’s criminal trial - both about the bargains they ’d struck with federal prosecutors , and about their own medical histories .
One failed to inform the jury that she ’d been diagnosed with several psychological disorders , allowing the jury to conclude that a breakdown she ’d suffered in 2002 was due to the drugs Dr. Rottschaefer had prescribed her , not her underlying medical conditions .
The other four had been or were later treated with medications similar to those Dr. Rottschaefer prescribed , and for the same conditions he had diagnosed .
Meaning that not only were Dr. Rottschaefer ’s actions not outside the scope of accepted medical practice , they were actually duplicated by other doctors .
It ’s unclear if [ U.S. Attorney Mary Beth ]
Buchanan and her subordinates are guilty of basic incompetence here , or something more sinister .
That they could look at what ’s come out since Dr. Rottschaefer ’s conviction and still feel he belongs in prison is telling , as is the fact that they ’ve yet to charge their star witness with perjury , despite overwhelming evidence that she committed it .
Why have n’t prosecutors charged their star witness with perjury even though they have abundant evidence from her own words that she committed it ?
I could n’t get an answer from them when I wrote about it .
If anyone has any insight , I welcome it .
Deniers Jump on NASA Gaff , While Greenland on Verge of Meltdown
By Stephen Leahy
Aug 16 , 2007 ( IPS ) – Scientists warn that climate change tipping points are imminent , and will lead to potentially catastrophic events like a seven - metre sea level rise .
Meanwhile , conservatives in the North American media are focusing on a NASA admission of a climate calculation error .
First the error .
U.S. and Canadian mainstream media and Internet news sites devoted tens of thousands of words over the past week to NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies admission that it made a calculation error ranking 1998 as the warmest year on record in the United States when it should have been 1934 .
While the difference is only a few hundredths of a degree , the climate change deniers variously cite this as evidence of NASA ( U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) incompetence and cover - up , and more proof that global warming is a hoax .
The neo -conservative U.S. network Fox News reported Aug. 9 that “ the discovery of an embarrassing temperature error rained on their ( the ‘ alarmists ’ ) parade . ”
Canada ’s National Post on Monday said the reasons given for climate change “ hysteria ” were “ no longer true ” .
The Washington Post and the Toronto Star both noted the reaction of conservatives in the media and in the blogosphere , including outspoken radio talk - show host Rush Limbaugh , who said : “ We have proof of man -made global warming .
The man -made global warming is inside NASA .
The man -made global warming is in the scientific community with false data . ”
Forgotten in all this is that U.S. temperatures are only a small part of the global mean average temperatures , which remain unchanged even with NASA ’s re-calculation .
Nine of the 10 hottest years globally have occurred in the last decade , although that is not the case in the United States , where there were several very warm years in the 1930s .
Now the warning :
The complete collapse of the massive Greenland Ice Sheet — which has a mean height of about two kilometres — now appears inevitable , and could raise sea levels seven metres .
“ It ’s a sobering message , I think , ” says Tim Lenton , of the School of Environmental Sciences at Britain ’s University of East Anglia .
Lenton ’s research group surveyed climate and glacial experts around the world and the consensus is that the recent evidence shows that rising temperatures will soon reach the Greenland Ice Sheet ’s “ tipping point ” , where it will break up within 300 years , raising sea levels by seven metres and flooding millions out their homes long before the year 2300 .
Recent calculations show the Greenland collapse could be triggered by temperature rise of just 1 degree Celsius warmer than today .
This is an example of what scientists call a “ non-linear response ” , in which a small change can make a big difference , more commonly described as “ tipping points ” .
And this point is coming much sooner than it looks .
Due to a time lag in the atmospheric warming response , even if there were no more greenhouse gas emissions from this day forward , temperatures would still rise another 0.6 degrees Celsius .
“ I do n’t want to say the Greenland meltdown is inevitable , but it will be very difficult to avoid , ” Lenton told IPS .
James Hansen , head of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , believes that without drastic international efforts , a sea level rise of up to five metres is possible .
“ In my opinion , if the world warms by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius , such massive sea level rise is inevitable , and a substantial fraction of the rise would occur within a century , ” Hansen wrote in the Jul. 25 issue of New Scientist magazine .
He notes that the last time the Earth was that much warmer was around three million years ago : “ It was a dramatically different planet then , with no Arctic sea ice in the warm seasons and sea level about 25 metres higher , give or take 10 metres . ”

Northern Rock - Britain 's Bank Run Coming to Main Street Soon ?
" ... The queues outside British bank Northern Bank have nothing to do with subprime US home loans .
But they have everything to do with today 's US banking model ... "
ON WEDNESDAY THIS WEEK the UK mortgage bank Northern Rock ran a banner advertisement across the bottom of The Daily Telegraph 's front page .
It promised 6.30 % interest on cash deposits , more than 250 basis points above the average rate - of - return offered on time deposits by UK banks in August .
British savers have n't been offered that much money to keep their cash in the bank in nearly a decade .
But Northern Rock 's plea for hard cash appears to have failed .
On Thursday , it arranged an emergency loan facility from the Bank of England , the UK 's central bank .
On Friday , queues formed at its branches across the country .
" I am going to take out the lot , every penny , " said one anxious saver to Bloomberg as he queued outside the bank 's West End branch in central London .
Over in the Square Mile of the City , reports the Financial Times online , a queue formed at the Northern Rock branch just 100 yards from the Bank of England 's very own front door .
" The website was down and no - one was answering the phone this morning , " said one of Northern Rock 's anxious depositors to the FT .
" When the shares fell 20 % [ on Friday morning ] I decided to come down and take my money out . "
Bereft of both cash deposits and the short - term funds it 's been unable to raise in the capital markets , Northern Rock called on the Old Lady to act in its capacity of " lender of last resort " .
The Bank of England has n't done this since 1973 , back when the collapse of Cedar Holdings – a pioneer of second - mortgage refinancing – threatened to spark a crisis in the country 's banking industry .
Northern Rock has also been a true pioneer in UK mortgages .
Its sudden trauma also gives the lie – if the lie were still needed – to any claim that America 's subprime crisis has been " contained " .
The UK 's fifth largest mortgage lender , Northern Rock repeated on Friday that only 0.24 % of its total assets are exposed to the US subprime market .
Ain't no subprime in them thar ' home - loans !
Instead , the problem stems from how Northern Rock financed its runaway growth .
" In the first 8 months of the year , Northern Rock 's total net lending was up 43 % over the same period in 2006 , with net residential lending up 55 % , " as it stated today .
This stellar performance compared to its peers came thanks to what the Financial Times now calls " an alternative banking model " .
The alternative being that it came from the United States , the home of debt securitization .
" Eschewing customer deposits kept down costs – the bank has just 76 branches – and facilitated a rapid expansion of the loan book , " says the FT online .
" Compared with the UK banking average of 7 % , Northern Rock used wholesale market securitization for 43 % of its funding . "
All told , the UK banking sector held one - fifth of liabilities in securitized loans by April this year , according to the Bank of England .
Back in the United States , meantime , " almost 68 % of home mortgage originations were securitized by 2005 , " says the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on its website , and " in the first quarter of 2007 , about half of all revolving consumer credit outstanding was held by pools of securitized assets , " says Sheila Bair , chair of the FDIC .
That matched the pattern of the last 10 years , Bair explained in testimony given before a House of Representatives subcommittee in early June .
If the need to refinance the loan book by appealing to the money markets has undone Northern Rock in the UK , what havoc might the ongoing liquidity crunch be causing in the US banking sector ?
Outstanding mortgage loans totaled more than $ 12.7 trillion by the end of last year , according to Plunkett Research .
That makes for more than $ 8.5 trillion in mortgage - backed bonds used to fund America 's recent – but now soured – love affair with real estate .
What if the need to raise new finance before extending new loans to buy new homes continues to meet with a big fat " No ! " from the money markets ?
" Northern Rock is a prime - only lender , " as the distressed borrower itself said today , " and credit quality on all its loan books remains strong .
Three - months plus arrears in the residential [ UK ] book were 0.47 % at the end of August , still under half the industry average . "
But built by borrowing short to lend long – rather than by the old fuddy - duddy method of attracting cash savers and then lending out their deposits – Northern Rock 's spectacular growth relied on cheap and plentiful liquidity .
That 's what the City of London knew .
The capital 's hacks , on the other hand , did not .
" Buy " said The Times on July 27th .
" Buy " said The Telegraph the same day .
" I have bought Northern Rock , " added an FT journalist one month later , " unable to resist a price of 645 p , which gives a forward p/e of 6 and a dividend yield of 6.2 % . "
The next day , Aug 25th , brought news that private investors were filling their boots with Northern Rock stock , as well .
" Last week and the end of the week before were the busiest time we 've seen since February / March this year , " the FT learnt from Alison Cashmore at TD Waterhouse , the big retail brokerage .
Trading volumes increased by more than 50 % , she said , with private investors " focusing particularly on banking stocks . "
The top five purchases for Britain 's private investors in August this year ?
Four banks and one airline – including both Northern Rock and Barclays , the third largest bank in the UK , whose CEO , Bob Diamond , demanded action from the Bank of England at the start of September .
If you 're tempted to buy banking or finance stocks now they 've pulled back so sharply , it might be worth asking yourself :
What might the capital markets know that you can't as a private investor ?
You 're left with only last quarter 's trading statement for guidance .
Just like British share investors who piled into Northern Rock at the end of August

A Government Accounting Office report has found that the Iraqi government has not met 13 of 18 benchmarks set by the US Congress .
The report was leaked before it could be doctored by the Bush administration , which promptly denounced it and pledged to . . . doctor it .
Another thing that could be said is that of the 18 congressional benchmarks some are frankly trivial .
The trivial ones are the only ones met .
I personally find the controversy about Iraq in Washington to be bizarre .
Are they really arguing about whether the situation is improving ?
I mean , you have the Night of the Living Dead over there .
People lack potable water , cholera has broken out even in the good areas , a third of people are hungry , a doubling of the internally displaced to at least 1.1 million , and a million pilgrims dispersed just this week by militia infighting in a supposedly safe all - Shiite area .
The government has all but collapsed , with even the formerly cooperative sections of the Sunni Arab political class withdrawing in a snit ( much less more Sunni Arabs being brought in from the cold ) .
The parliament has n’t actually passed any legislation to speak of and often cannot get a quorum .
Corruption is endemic .
The weapons we give the Iraqi army are often sold off to the insurgency .
Some of our development aid goes to them , too .
The average number of Iraqis killed in 2007 per day exceeds those killed in 2006 .
Independent counts by news organizations do not agree with Pentagon estimates about drops in civilian deaths over - all .
Nation - wide attacks in June reached a daily all - time high of 177.5 .
True , violence in Baghdad has been wrestled back down to the levels of summer , 2006 ( hint : it was n’t paradise ) , but violence levels are up in the rest of the country .
If you compare each month in 2006 with each month in 2007 with regard to US military deaths , the 2007 picture is dreadful .
I saw on CNN this smarmy Bush administration official come and and say that US troop deaths had fallen because of the surge , which is why we should support it .
Just read the following chart bottom to top and compare 2006 month by month to 2007 .
US troop deaths have n’t fallen .
They are way up .
Besides , they would be zero if the US were not occupying Iraq militarily , so if we should support a policy that leads to fewer troop deaths , that is the better policy .
Here are the US troop death via Icasualties.org .

I mean , how brain dead do the Bushies think we are , peddling this horse manure that US troop deaths have fallen ?
( There are always seasonal variations because in the summer it is 120 F. in the shade and guerrillas are too heat - exhausted to fight ; but the summer 2007 numbers are much greater than those for summer 2006 ; that is n’t progress . )
And why does our corporate media keep repeating this Goebbels - like propaganda ?
Do we really live in an Orwellian state ?
I ’m at a conference .
I would make a chart to illustrate the above if I had the time .
Somebody else please do it .
Maybe we bloggers can unite to keep the debate from being conducted on false premises for once .
( Thanks just a million to Kevin Drum at Washington Monthly and all the others who responded to my call for a graph here .
It is striking when you see it that way .
Look in comments for more such links . )
Repeat : US troop deaths in Iraq have not fallen and that is not a reason to support the troop escalation .
And , violence in Iraq has not fallen because of the surge .
Violence is way up this year .

Introduction
This page is intended as a brief overview of delimited continuations and related constructs , and how they can be used in Haskell .
It uses the library CC - delcont as a vehicle for doing so , but the examples should be general enough so that if you have another implementation , they should be relatively straight forward to port ( whenever possible , I have endeavored not to use the operators on abstract prompt and sub-continuation types from CC - delcont , instead using the more typical , functional operators ) .
The basics
Undelimited continuations
If you 've taken university courses in computer science , or done much investigation of language design , you 've probably encountered continuations before .
The author first recalls learning about them in a class on said subject , where they were covered very briefly , and it was mentioned ( without proof ; and no proof will be provided here ) that they could be used as a basis upon which all control flow operators could be built .
At the time , they seemed rather abstract and unwieldy .
Perhaps they could be used to implement any more common control flow pattern , but why bother , when , as far as language implementation concerns go , it 's easier to implement ( and understand ) most common control flow directly than it is to implement continuations ?
As far as usage goes , continuations are probably most closely associated with Scheme , and its call - with - current - continuation function ( abbreviated to Haskell 's version , callCC from now on ) , although many other languages have them ( undelimited continuations for Haskell are provided by the Cont monad and ContT transformer ) .
They 're often regarded as being difficult to understand , as their use can cause very complex control flow patterns ( much like GOTO , although more sophisticated ) , though reduced to their basics , they are n't that hard to understand .
A continuation of an expression is , in a loose sense , ' the stuff that happens after the expression . '
An example to refer to may help :
m >>= f >>= g >>= h
Here we have an ordinary monadic pipeline .
A computation m is run , and its result is fed into f , and so on .
We might ask what the continuation of ' m ' is , the portion of the program that executes after m , and it looks something like :
\ x -> f x >>= g >>= h
The continuation takes the value produced by m , and feeds it into ' the rest of the program . '
But , the fact that we can represent this using functions as above should be a clue that continuations can be built up using them , and indeed , this is the case .
There is a standard way to transform a program written normally ( or in a monadic style , as above ) into a program in which continuations , represented as functions , are passed around explicitly ( known as the CPS transform ) , and this is what Cont / ContT does .
However , such a transform would be of little use if the passed continuations were inaccessible ( as with any monad ) , and callCC is just the operator for the job .
It will call a function with the implicitly passed continuation , so in :
callCC ( \ k -> e ) >>= f >>= g >>= h
'k ' will be set to a function that is something like the above '\x -> f x >>= g >>= h ' .
However , in some sense , it is not an ordinary function , as it will never return to the point where it is invoked .
Instead , calling ' k ' should be viewed as execution jumping to the point where callCC was invoked , with the entire ' callCC (.. ) ' expression replaced with the value passed to 'k ' .
So k is not merely a normal function , but a way of feeding a value into into an execution context ( and this is reflected in its monadic type : a -> Cont b ) .
So , what is all this good for ?
Well , a standard example is that one can use continuations to capture a method of escaping from loops ( particularly nested ones ) , and if you ponder for a while , you might be able to imagine implementing some sort of exception mechanism with them .
A simple example is computing the product of a list of numbers :
prod l = callCC ( \ k -> loop k l ) where loop _ [ ] = return 1 loop k ( 0 : _ ) = k 0 loop k ( x : xs ) = do n <- loop k xs ; return ( n * x )
Under normal circumstances , the loop will simply multiply all the numbers .
However , if a 0 is detected , there is no need to multiply anything , the answer will always be 0 .
So , the continuation is invoked , and 0 is returned immediately , without performing any multiplications .
Delimited continuations
So , continuations ( hopefully ) seem pretty clear , and at least theoretically useful .
Where do delimited continuations come into the picture ?
The story ( according to the hearsay the author has come across ) goes back again to Scheme .
As was mentioned earlier , callCC is often associated with it .
Another thing closely associated with Scheme ( and Lisp in general ) is interactive environments in which code can be defined and run ( much like our own Hugs and GHCi ) .
Naturally , it would be nice if such environments could themselves be written in Scheme .
However , continuations in Scheme are not implemented as they are in Haskell .
In Haskell , continuation using code is tagged with a monadic type , and one must use runCont ( T ) to run such computations , and the effects can't escape it .
In Scheme , continuations are native , and all code can capture them , and capturing them captures not ' the rest of the Cont ( T ) computation , ' but ' the rest of the program . '
And if the interactive loop is written in Scheme , this includes the loop itself , so programs run within the session can affect the session itself .
Now , this might be a minor nit , but it is a nit nonetheless , and luckily for us , it led to the idea of delimited continuations .
The idea was , of course , to tag a point at which the interactive loop invoked some sub- program , and then control flow operators such as callCC would only be able to capture a portion of the program up to the marker .
To the sub - program , this is all that 's of interest anyhow .
Such a setup would solve the issue nicely .
However , once one has the ability to create such markers , why not put them in the hands of the programmer ?
Then , instead of them being able to capture ' the rest of the program 's execution , ' they would be able to delimit , capture and manipulate arbitrary portions of their programs .
And indeed , such operations can be useful .
Samples
Iterators
So , what are delimited continuations good for ?
Well , suppose we have a binary tree data type like so :
data Tree a = Leaf | Branch a ( Tree a ) ( Tree a ) empty = Leaf singleton a = Branch a Leaf Leaf insert b Leaf = Branch b Leaf Leaf insert b ( Branch a l r ) | b < a = Branch a ( insert b l ) r | otherwise = Branch a l ( insert b r ) fold :: ( a -> b -> b -> b ) -> b ->
Tree a -> b fold f z Leaf = z fold f z ( Branch a l r ) = f a ( fold f z l ) ( fold f z r ) for :: Monad m =>
Tree a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m ( ) for t f = fold ( \ a l r -> l >> f a >> r ) ( return ( ) ) t
Now , we have a fold over our data type , and as shown , we can therefore write a monadic iteration function ' for ' over it ( this is actually done for arbitrary data types in Data .
Foldable ) .
The fold is a fine method of traversing the data structure to operate on elements in most cases .
However , what if we wanted something more like an iterator object , which somehow captured the traversal of the tree , remembering what element we 're currently at , and which come next ?
Well , it turns out one can build just such an object using continuations .
It is indeed possible to build it using undelimited continuations , but it 's rather complex to do so ( I 'll not include code that does , as I do n't feel like figuring out all the details ) .
However , it turns out it 's easy using delimited continuations :
data Iterator m a = Done | Cur a ( m ( Iterator m a ) ) begin :: MonadDelimitedCont p s m =>
Tree a -> m ( Iterator m a ) begin t = reset $ \ p -> for t ( \ a -> shift p ( \ k -> return ( Cur a ( k $ return ( ) ) ) ) ) >> return Done current :: Iterator m a ->
Maybe a current Done = Nothing current ( Cur a _ ) =
Just a next :: Monad m => Iterator m a -> m ( Iterator m a ) next Done = return Done next ( Cur _ i ) = i finished :: Iterator m a ->
Bool finished Done = True finished _ = False
So , clearly , Iterator is the type of iterators over a tree .
current , next and done are some utility functions for operating on them .
The interesting work is done in the begin function .
There are two delimited control operators in play here .
First is reset , which is a way to place a delimiter around a computation .
The term ' p ' is simply a way to reference that delimiter ; the library I 'm working with allows for many named delimiters to exist , and for control operators to specify which delimiters they 're working with ( so a control operator may capture the continuation up to p , even if it runs into a delimiter q sooner , provided p /= q ) .
The other operator is shift , which is used to capture the delimited continuation .
In many ways , it 's like callCC , but with an important difference : it aborts the captured continuation .
When callCC is called on a function f , if f returns normally , execution will pick up from just after the callCC .
However , when shift is called , the continuation between the call and the enclosing prompt is packaged up ( into ' k ' here ) , and passed to the function , and a normal return will return to the place where the delimiter was set , not where shift was called .
With this in mind , we can begin to analyze the ' begin ' function .
First , it delimits a computation with the delimiter ' p ' .
Next , it begins to loop over the tree .
For each element , we use ' shift ' to capture " the rest of the loop " , calling it 'k ' .
We then package that , and the current tree element , into an Iterator object , and return it .
Since the shift has aborted the rest of the loop ( for the time being ) , it returns to where ' reset ' was called , and the function returns the iterator object ( wrapped in a monad , of course ) .
The main remaining piece of interest is when next goes to get the next element of the traversal .
When this happens , 'k $ return ( ) ' is executed , which invokes the captured continuation ( with the value ( ) , because the loop does n't take the return value of the traversal function into account anyway ) .
This , essentially , re-enters the loop .
If there is a next element , then the traversal function is called with it , shift will once again capture ' the rest of the loop ' ( from a later point that before , though ) , and return an iterator object with the new current element and continuation .
If there are no new elements , then control will pass out of the loop to the following computation , which is , in this case , ' return Done ' , so in either case , an Iterator object is the result , and the types work out .
We can test our iterator like so :
main :: IO ( ) main = runCCT $ do t <- randomTree 10 i <- begin t doStuff i where doStuff i | finished i = return ( ) | otherwise = do i' <- next i i' ' <- next i liftIO $ print ( fromJust $ current i :: Int ) doStuff i' randomTree n = rt empty n where rt t 0 = return t rt t n = do r <- liftIO randomIO rt ( insert r t ) ( n - 1 )
The output of which might go something like :
-1937814587 -1171184756 -1068642732 -741588272 -553872051 -499564662 -421862876 -59900888 315891595 1868487875
The example shows one possibly interesting property : one can re-use old iterators without affecting new ones .
In this case , we call ' next ' on the same iterator twice , but it does n't advance the iterator twice .
Our iterators behave like an ordinary functional data structure , even though they 're built out of somewhat out - of - the - ordinary components .
Breadth - first Traversal
This example is an adaptation of an example from a set of slides by Olivier Danvy , Delimited - Continuations Blues .
It involves the traversal of a binary tree , so let 's first define such a type :
data Tree a = Node a ( Tree a ) ( Tree a ) | Leaf a t = Node 1 ( Node 2 ( Leaf 3 ) ( Node 4 ( Leaf 5 ) ( Leaf 6 ) ) ) ( Node 7 ( Node 8 ( Leaf 9 ) ( Leaf 10 ) ) ( Leaf 11 ) ) toList ( Leaf i ) = [ i ] toList ( Node a t1 t2 ) = a : toList t1 ++ toList t2
toList is a pre-order , depth - first traversal , and t is ordered so that such a traversal yields [ 1 .. 11 ] .
Depth - first traversals are clearly the easiest to write in a language like Haskell , since recursive descent on the trees can be used .
To perform a breadth - first traversal , one would likely keep a list of sub - trees at a given level , and pass through the list at each level , visiting roots , and producing a new list of the children one level down .
Which is a bit more bookkeeping .
However , it turns out that delimited control can allow one to write breadth - first traversal in a recursive descent style similar to the depth - first traversal ( modulo the need for monads ) :
visit :: MonadDelimitedCont p s m => p [ a ] ->
Tree a -> m () visit p = visit ' where visit ' ( Leaf i ) = control p $ \ k -> ( i : ) ` liftM ` k ( return ( ) ) visit ' ( Node i t1 t2 ) = control p $ \ k -> do a <- k ( return ( ) ) visit ' t2 visit ' t1 ( i : ) ` liftM ` return a bf :: MonadDelimitedCont p s m =>
Tree a -> m [ a ] bf t = reset $ \ p -> visit p t >> return [ ]
And , a quick check shows that ' bf t2 ' yields :
[ 5,6,9,10,3,4,8,11,2,7,1 ]
( Note that in this example , since elements are always pre-pended , the element visited first will be last in the list , and vice versa ; so this is a pre-order breadth - first traversal ) .
So , how exactly does this work ?
As the slides say , the key idea is to " return before recursively traversing the subtrees . "
This is accomplished through the use of the delimited control operator ' control . '
At the Node stage of a traversal , control is used to capture the sub-continuation that comes after said Node ( which is , effectively , the traversal over the rest of the nodes at the same level ) .
However , instead of descending depth - first style , that sub-continuation is immediately invoked , the result being called a .
Only after that are the sub - trees descended into .
It should be noted , also , that this particular example can be used to display a difference between ' shift ' ( the so - called ' static ' delimited operator ) and ' control ' ( which is one of the ' dynamic ' operators ) .
The difference between the two is that in ' shift p ( \k -> e ) ' calls to k are delimited by the prompt p , whereas in control , they are not ( in both , e is ) .
This has important consequences .
For instance , at some point in a traversal an evaluation may look something like :
delimited ( visit ' t2 >> visit ' t1 )
Which , using some simplified notation / traversal , expands to :
delimited ( control ( \ k -> k ( ) >> visit ' t22 >> visit ' t21 ) >> control ( \ k -> k ( ) >> visit ' t12 >> visit ' t11 ) )
Which , due to the effects of control turns into :
delimited (( control ( \ k -> k ( ) >> visit ' t12 >> visit ' t11 ) ) >> visit ' t22 >> visit ' t21 ) ==> delimited ( visit ' t22 >> visit ' t21 >> visit ' t12 >> visit ' t11 )
In other words , using ' control ' ends up building and executing a sequence of traversals at the same level , after the actions for the above level performed by the 'k ( ) ' .
The control operators of the lower level are then free to close over , and manipulate all the visitations on there level .
This is why the result is a breadth - first traversal .
However , replacing control with shift , we get :
delmited ( visit ' t2 >> visit ' t1 ) == > delimited ( ( shift ( \ k -> k ( ) >> visit ' t22 >> visit ' t21 ) ) >> ( shift ( \ k -> k ( ) >> visit ' t12 >> visit ' t11 ) ) ) ==> delimited ( delimited ( shift ( \ k -> k ( ) >> visit ' t12 >> visit ' t11 ) ) >> visit ' t22 >> visit ' t21 )
And already we can see a difference .
The sub - traversal of t1 is now isolated , and control effects ( via shift , at least ) therein cannot affect the sub- traversal of t2 .
So , control effects no longer affect an entire level of the whole tree , and instead are localized to a given node and its descendants .
In such a case , we end up with an ordinary depth - first traversal ( although the sub- continuations allow the visitation of each node to look a bit different than toList , and since we 're always pre-pending , as we get to a node , the results are reversed compared to toList ) .
In any case , the desired result has been achieved : A slightly modified recursive descent traversal has allowed us to express breadth - first search ( and depth - first search in the same style is a matter of substitution of control operators ) without having to do the normal list - of - sub - trees sort of bookkeeping ( although the added weight of working with delimited control may more than outweigh that ) .
For a more in - depth discussion of the differences between shift , control and other , similar operators , see Shift to Control , cited below .
Resumable Parsing
Our next example concerns a Haskell version of a post to the OCaml mailing list .
The translation was originally given on the haskell - cafe mailing list , and complete code and some additional discussion can be found there .
The problem is similar to the above iterator example .
Specifically , we are in need of a parser that can take fragments of input at a time , suspending for more input after each fragment , until such time as it can be provided .
However , there are already plenty of fine parsing libraries available , and ideally , we do n't want to have to re-write a new library from scratch just to have this resumable parser feature .
As it turns out , delimited continuations provide a fairly straightforward way to have our cake and eat it too in this case .
First , we 'll need a data type for the resumable parser .
-- Needs Rank2 Types data Request m a = Done a | ReqChar ( Maybe Char -> m ( Request m a ) )
Such a parser is either complete , or in a state of requesting more characters .
Again , we 'll have some convenience functions for working on the data type :
provide :: Monad m => Char ->
Request m a -> m ( Request m a ) provide _ d @ ( Done _ ) = return d provide c ( ReqChar k ) = k ( Just c ) provideString :: Monad m => String ->
Request m a -> m ( Request m a ) provideString [ ] s = return s provideString ( x : xs ) s = provide x s >>= provideString xs finish :: Monad m =>
Request m a -> m ( Request m a ) finish d @ ( Done _ ) = return d finish ( ReqChar k ) = k Nothing
So , ' provide ' feeds a character into a parser , ' provideString ' feeds in a string , and ' finish ' informs the parser that there are no more characters to be had .
Finally , we need to have some way of suspending parsing and waiting for characters .
This is exactly what delimited continuations do for us .
The hook we 'll use to get control over the parser is through the character stream it takes as input :
toList :: Monad m => m ( Maybe a ) -> m [ a ] toList gen = gen >>= maybe ( return [ ] ) ( \ c -> liftM ( c : ) $ toList gen ) streamInvert :: MonadDelimitedCont p s m => p ( Request m a ) -> m ( Maybe Char ) streamInvert p = shift p ( \ k -> return $ ReqChar ( k . return ) ) invertParse :: MonadDelimitedCont p s m => ( String -> a ) -> m ( Request m a ) invertParse parser = reset $ \ p -> ( Done . parser ) ` liftM ` toList ( stream Invert p )
So , ' toList ' simply takes a monadic action that may produce a character , and uses it to produce a list of characters ( stopping when it sees a ' Nothing ' ) .
' streamInvert ' is just such a monadic , character - producing action ( given a delimiter ) .
Each time it is run , it captures a sub-continuation ( here , ' the rest of the list generation ' ) , and puts it in a Request object .
We can then pass around the Request object , and feed characters in as desired ( via ' provide ' and ' provideString ' above ) , gradually building the list of characters to be parsed .
In the ' invertParse ' method , this gradually produced list is fed through a parser ( of type String -> a , so it does n't need to know about the delimited continuation monad we 're using ) , and the output of the parser is packaged in a finished ( Done ) Request object , so when we finally call ' finish ' , we will be able to access the results of the parser .
For this example , the words function suffices as a parser :
gradualParse :: [ String ] gradualParse = runCC $ do p1 <- invertParse words p2 <- provideString
" The quick " p1 p3 <- provideString " brown fox jum " p2 p4 <- provideString " ps over the laz " p3 p5 <- provideString " y dog " p4 >>= finish p6 <- provideString " iest dog " p 4 >>= finish let ( Done l1 ) = p5 ( Done l2 ) = p6 return ( l1 ++ l2 ) main :: IO ( ) main = mapM_ putStrLn gradualParse
And we get output :
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
The quick brown fox jumps over the laziest dog
So , the resumable parser works .
It will pause at arbitrary places in the parse , even in the middle of tokens , and wait for more input .
And one can resume a parse from any point to which a Request pointer is saved without interfering with other resumable parser objects .
( A note : depending on what exactly one wants to do with such parsers , there are a few nits in the above implementation .
It does n't exactly match the semantics of the OCaml parser .
For more information on this topic , see the linked mailing - list thread , as it discusses the issues , their causes , and provides an alternate implementation ( which changes mostly the parser , not the delimited continuation end ) which matches the OCaml version much more closely )

More information
A google search for delimited continuations will likely yield plenty of interesting resources on the subject .
However , the following resources proved especially useful to the author when he was investigating them :

One of the frequent mistakes I see when working with clients is that they do n’t gauge their personal performance with the proper benchmark .
I have people who have an intermediate portfolio with 50 % bonds upset because they are lagging the S&P 500 by a couple percent , while others are invested heavily in international stocks , yet compare their performance to a domestic small - cap index .
It can be confusing with so many different benchmarks , and the likelihood of your portfolio not quite matching up exactly with some of them .
But , if you are n’t comparing the numbers to the right benchmark , they are worthless .
Determine Your Asset Allocation First
Before you can even consider picking a benchmark , you need to actually understand what you ’re really invested in .
Unless you just own one index fund , you probably have a relatively complex mix of large and small - cap , international and domestic companies , bonds , cash , or maybe even other specialty investments .
Once you know the breakdown of your portfolio , you can then begin to look for the appropriate benchmark to measure it against .
The best way to do this is to use the free Portfolio Manager tool at Morningstar .
Registration is free , and this login will allow you to access many other free tools available throughout the site .
With portfolio manager you can track and analyze your portfolio , using unique Morningstar features such as Portfolio X - Ray , Interpreter , and Stock Intersection .
When you create a portfolio , you can track what investments you have and the number of shares owned .
Here is a quick snapshot of what you ’d see after entering your holdings :
Use the X - Ray Tool For More Detail
One of the most handy tools is the X - Ray tool .
This will show you a detailed breakdown of your portfolio from asset class , credit quality and maturity , market sector , and even compare holdings to the S&P 500 .
This is where you really begin to understand what your portfolio is made out of .
In this example , we can see that this portfolio is heavy on large - cap stocks across all three areas from value to growth , and contains around 14 % of holdings in bonds and cash .
Clearly , this portfolio is n’t 100 % equity , and the allocation of holdings does not match the S&P 500 exactly , so that would not be an appropriate benchmark .
Compare Results to an Appropriate Benchmark
Now that you understand how your portfolio is structured , you can find a benchmark that is more closely aligned with your true holdings .
Morningstar provides yet another tool within the portfolio tracker to provide a quick estimate as to how well your portfolio is doing with the Performance tab .
Once you select that tab , you can see how your returns matched up against various benchmarks of your choice .
Obviously , this does n’t take into account multiple purchases over time through dollar cost averaging or any withdrawals , but it shows you what that particular portfolio would have done over the specified time frame .
Let ’s look at two different examples to see how they differ .
We ’ll first compare the trailing 12 month period against the S&P 500 , which is the default benchmark :
Vs. S&P 500
Clearly , your portfolio is not performing as well as the S&P 500 , and it should n’t .
Remember , you are holding various investments , some of which have more of a growth component , not to mention close to 14 % in fixed income .
So the question should n’t be concerned with the under performance , but whether or not that performance is appropriate for your investment mix .
Since this portfolio contains almost entirely large - cap stocks across value through growth , a closer benchmark at least for the equities portion would probably be the Morningstar Large - Cap Core benchmark :
Vs. Large Core
As you can see , the performance gap against this benchmark is a bit closer than to the S&P .
Again , this is n’t a completely accurate representation since the actual portfolio does hold bonds , but the YTD , 1 - Year and 3 - Year returns are generally insignificant , often under 0.5 % .
This is actually quite good for essentially an 85/15 mix of stocks and bonds .
Final Thoughts
There will never be a perfect way to measure performance once your portfolio begins to get complex , but comparing it to the most appropriate benchmark will give you a much better idea of how it is actually doing .
You could be beating the S&P by 10 % , but if you are invested in a few specific sector funds , that does n’t mean anything .
Maybe you ’re beating the S&P , but you might be in some of the worst performing funds of that particular sector and not doing as well as you should .
Just the same , you might have 50 % of your portfolio in bonds , yet only lag the S&P by a couple points .
That would be fantastic if you could do that well with such a high percentage of fixed income in your portfolio .
So , it all comes down to what you ’re comparing your returns to , and before you make any drastic changes to your investments based on performance , make sure you are comparing to the right benchmark .
You may think that the 5 % return you ’re earning every year stinks , but if you examine your portfolio closely , it may be doing exactly what it should be based on how it is constructed .

This scene was apparently removed from the bible in a late draft due to the general consensus that no one would know what an ‘ x - ray ’ was at the time .
Recently another one of those stupid government policies , supported by even stupider arguments , was brought to my attention on a state - run , taxpayer - financed radio station .
I know very well that the Swedish government finances all education with what the government goons have looted from the working populace .
And I know there is a general student financing program too , to cover any expenses for those poor people choosing to get a degree or two already paid for .
Part of this financing scheme is loan ( guaranteed by the government ) , part of it is a grant offered to anyone passing most ( not all ) of the classes taken .
Still the radio show made me aware of the magnitude of this system .
It opened up my eyes for the reason so many students from abroad come to visit Swedish universities — and why they stay for so long .
The reason ?
Our government forces Swedish taxpayers to give the same kind of financing to foreign students as well .
Actually , it is illegal to ask foreigners to pay tuition , and it is illegal to deny foreigners the grants and subsidized loans .
So why do foreign students go to Sweden to study ?
Well , who can blame them — this is kind of the free lunch Robert A. Heinlein claimed does n’t exist .
For those of you not knowing what the very generous government education system in Sweden is about and what it covers , let me simply say it covers EVERYTHING .
You wo n’t get rich from the grants and loans , but you certainly wo n’t get poor either .
And you certainly do n’t have to worry if you want to go to graduate school to get a master ’s or doctorate ; it is all paid for by the heavily taxed Swedish populace .
Actually , if you ’re aiming for a doctorate you will get a salary for the four or five years it will take you to earn that degree .
There is no such thing as tuition at any of the universities .
You might think this is a way for politicians to find a way to spend more money than they “ have to ” and therefore they make this a secret .
No , that ’s not how it is — there ’s a whole web site on the how ’s and why ’s of studying in Sweden , advertising the fact that it is all at Swedish taxpayers ’ expense : www.studyinsweden.se.
This , I think , probably strikes at the core ( well , one of them ) of what modern socialism is all about : stop as many immigrants as possible at the border to keep the people inborn and ignorant of the world , but waste taxpayers ’ money to advertise the glorious welfare state by subsidizing foreigners only temporarily in the country and thus never contributing to the welfare system .
This is , actually , what most western states are doing and have been doing for quite a while .
The U.S. government , for instance , issues visas to students who get their degrees at U.S. state - subsidized universities , but then forces them to leave the country as soon as they ’ve earned their degrees .
One would think it more rational to ask them to stay to work and pay taxes , but that is obviously not a valid conclusion in political reasoning .
Knowing about the educational dimension of the Swedish welfare state , the most pressing question on any rational person ’s mind should be : why does the Swedish government offer free education to foreign students — and why does it even offer to pay them to study ?
The reason was briefly suggested in the same radio show , and it is a thoroughly political reason .
The politicians want to show Sweden to the world as a generous and prosperous ( well … ) welfare state , while at the same time avoid confronting the people on the issues .
Apart from the state marketing scheme , it seems the socialists in government simply do n’t want foreigners to pay tuition to Swedish taxpayers - financed universities , since that might make Swedes more prone to accept paying for education .
If the issue is raised , the socialists would have to face the fact that foreigners pay for education in Sweden ( and can afford to do so ) .
That is simply too “ costly ” politically speaking .
But is n’t it more costly to let Swedish taxpayers pay for educating the whole world ?
Of course , but this kind of economic reasoning makes sense only to the non-political a.k.a. real world .
In politics , benefit is defined as what can be bought at someone else ’s expense , at gunpoint if necessary , and cost is only expressed in terms of loss of power and risk of people calling the political bluff .
Thus : it is cheaper , politically speaking , to force the nine million Swedes to finance universities for whoever wants free education in a world of more than six billion people .
It never fails to amaze me , this political logic .
I know everything about it —
I ’ve seen it from behind the scenes — yet I am truly surprised , almost on a daily basis , at the stupidity and ignorance of the political class .
However could they , the stupid , ignorant , and moronic people unable to produce anything themselves , become our rulers ?
The Best of Per Bylund
PATENTS are supposed to give inventors an incentive to create things that spur economic growth .
For some companies , especially in the pharmaceutical business , patents do just that by allowing them to pull in billions in profits from brand - name , blockbuster drugs .
But for most public companies , patents do n’t pay off , say a couple of researchers who have crunched the numbers .
“ Today , over all , patents do n’t work ; for the information technology industry especially , they do n’t work , ” said James Bessen , who became a lecturer at Boston University ’s law school after a career in business .
In 1983 , he created the first computer publishing software with Wysiwyg ( an acronym for “ what you see is what you get ” ) printing abilities .
He also founded a desktop publishing company , Bestinfo , later acquired by Intergraph .
Neither Mr. Bessen nor his company patented anything , in part because his lawyers told him that software could n’t be patented at the time .
He ultimately became interested in whether patents spurred innovation , since the software industry for years innovated steadily without using many patents .
He and a colleague , Michael J. Meurer , are readying a book on the topic , “ Do Patents Work ? , ” due in 2008 .
( A synopsis and sample chapters are at researchoninnovation.org / dopatentswork / . )
The two researchers have analyzed data from 1976 to 1999 , the most recent year with complete data .
They found that starting in the late 1990s , publicly traded companies saw patent litigation costs outstrip patent profits .
Specifically , they estimate that about $ 8.4 billion in global profits came directly from patents held by publicly traded United States companies in 1997 , rising to about $ 9.3 billion in 1999 , with two - thirds of the profits going to chemical and pharmaceutical companies .
Domestic litigation costs alone , meanwhile , soared to $ 16 billion in 1999 from $ 8 billion in 1997 .
Breaking news :
The Army officer in charge of the interrogation / torture operation at Abu Ghraib in late 2003 is being court - martialed .
My first thought : Finally , an officer is being held accountable .
In view of the repeated rebuff to my own attempts to stop the torture and identify those responsible , however , you will perhaps excuse my skepticism that justice will be done .
An Army intelligence analyst , my job at Abu Ghraib was systems administrator ( “ the computer guy ” ) .
But I had the bad luck to be on the night shift .
And so I saw the detainees dragged in for interrogation , heard the screams , and saw many of them dragged out .
Watching Act I of the faux - trial of Lt. Col.
Steven Jordan last week at Fort Meade , Md. , confirmed my worst suspicions .
I know Jordan ; I was in place for his entire tenure at Abu Ghraib , including when prisoners were being tortured ; he was an immediate boss .
Enter from the wings Reserve Maj. Gen. George Fay .
Fay was handpicked to run interference for then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld by conducting the same kind of “ full and thorough investigation ” that former President Richard Nixon ordered for Watergate .
With Fay , too , I speak from personal experience .
Shortly after photos of the torture at Abu Ghraib were published , I found myself being interviewed by Fay on May 1 , 2004 .
It was a surreal performance , with Fay seeming to take his cue at times from Peter Seller ’s Inspector Clouseau .
Except it was n’t funny then , and it is n’t funny now .
To me , Fay showed himself singularly uninterested in what really was going on at Abu Ghraib .
I had to ask him repeatedly to listen to my account .
Whereupon he said he would recommend action against me for not reporting what I knew sooner , for , if I had done that , I could have prevented the scandal .
Right .
In my view , it was clear that Fay ’s job was to quiet any discordant notes from noncommissioned officers like me and help Rumsfeld push the responsibility down to “ bad apples ” at the bottom of the chain of command .
When Maj. Gen. Taguba ’s Abu Ghraib investigation report was leaked to the press on May 4 , 2004 , I was very surprised to find myself listed as the only military intelligence soldier to witness to the truth .
And for my conscientiousness , the Army imposed an exclusive gag order on me 10 days later ; a week after that my top - secret clearance was suspended , and eventually I was reduced in rank .
Memory Loss
So it came as no surprise to me that Fay would continue to play a disingenuous role at the court - martial of Lt. Col. Jordan .
Jordan is the only officer and the last of the 12 persons charged in the scandal to go to trial .
Eleven enlisted soldiers have been convicted of crimes , with the longest sentence , 10 years , given to former Cpl. Charles Graner Jr. in January 2005 .
Two of the charges against Jordan ( together punishable by eight years in prison ) were obstruction of justice and lying to Fay .
On the day before Jordan ’s trial began , Fay contacted Army prosecutors to claim that he “ misspoke ” in earlier testimony that he had advised Jordan of his rights before interviewing him in 2004 .
The Army judge was quick to approve a defense motion to dismiss the false - statement and obstruction of justice charges .
Eight years off a possible sentence even before the trial begins !
Not bad .
The next stiffest possible sentence was five years for disobeying Fay ’s ban on discussing the investigation with others .
But not to worry .
Testifying last Wednesday , Fay could not remember when he had told Jordan to avoid discussing the investigation .
Enter defense attorney Maj. Kris Poppe .
To Fay : “ Today you testified you gave a specific order not to discuss  to speak to no one .
And that testimony is based on your memory , is it not , sir ? ”
“ It is , ” Fay replied .
So , presumably , we can now strike five more years off a possible sentence .
What ’s left of the charges ?
Cruelty and maltreatment of detainees , punishable by one year in prison .
But the Army prosecutor amended that particular count by reducing its scope from three months to a single day .
The only other charges are failure to obey a regulation ( a possible two - year sentence ) and dereliction of duty ( six months ) .
It seems a safe bet that Jordan , like his immediate supervisor , Col. Thomas Pappas , will get off with a reprimand and a minor fine .
If They Had Asked Me
According to press reports , other witnesses will be called to testify at the Jordan court - martial .
Strange .
Although I was at Abu Ghraib for the entire time Jordan was there , for some reason the prosecution does not seem interested in using my testimony at this trial .
I could , for example , provide testimony demolishing the myth that Jordan was not all that involved in interrogations .
One of the soldiers who worked very closely with Jordan verified that he was fully familiar with the infamous “ hard site , ” where much of the torture took place .
Jordan had been seen there on more than one occasion , hanging out , laid back , with his feet propped up .
My soldier informant also bragged that he had joined Jordan in beating up a prisoner .
Jordan also took liberties with what were standard procedures , much like the CIA and other civilians who did not seem to bother much with such niceties .
One of the sergeants with direct access to Jordan told me that Jordan felt empowered to ignore regulations and interview detainees alone , which was highly irregular even for swashbuckling CIA interrogators .
I cannot tell whether the Army is deliberately oblivious to my potential input or it is simply not taking these things seriously .
Last month , a person from the Army ’s Criminal Investigations Division and one from the team prosecuting Jordan came to interview me .
Why ?
Because they had seen me in a documentary and learned from the film that I was at Abu Ghraib at the same time as Jordan .
Never mind the copious testimony I had given over the past several years .
Never have I been called to testify at any of the trials .
No One Accountable
In keeping with the Rumsfeld adage “ Stuff Happens , ” and the Senate Armed Services Committee ’s timidity , no senior U.S. Army officer or defense official is likely to be held accountable for the torture , “ ghost ” prisoners , and other abuses at Abu Ghraib .
Only the bad apples at the bottom ; none of the ones at the top .
Not the commander in chief , who authorized torture by memorandum on Feb.
7 , 2002 , announcing and implementing a new policy that detainees be treated “ humanely , as appropriate , and as consistent with military necessity . ”
Not then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , nor his deputy Paul Wolfowitz , nor U.S. pro-consul Paul Bremer , nor troop commander Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez , nor Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller ( in charge of Gitmo- izing Abu Ghraib ) , nor Sanchez ’s intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Barbara Fast , nor National Security Council functionary Frances Townsend .
All of the above visited Abu Ghraib during the torture year of 2003 before the photos surfaced the next year .
Had it never occurred to them that their incessant pressure on Army interrogators to find nonexistent WMD in Iraq and nonexistent ties between Iraq and al - Qaeda , together with the expanded list of torture techniques duly approved by hired - gun lawyers in the Pentagon , the office of the vice president , and the Department of Justice , would lead to the abuses of Abu Ghraib ?
Not to mention things like the marginal notes from Rumsfeld , on the list of torture techniques : “ Make sure this happens . ”
Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell
Only one general officer passes the smell test , and he with flying colors  Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba .
On Jan. 31 , 2004 , he was asked to look into the abuses at Abu Ghraib .
A mark of his seriousness of purpose is the fact that Taguba completed his investigation in two months and did not sugarcoat his findings : “ Systemic and illegal abuse of detainees numerous incidents of sadistic , blatant , and wanton criminal abuses . ”
In an attempt to explain how it could be that Taguba could deviate so far from the official line , one wag speculated that , for some reason , Taguba “ did n’t get the memo . ”
He did an honest job  and we would probably not ever have seen his unvarnished findings , had not some patriotic truth - teller ( AKA leaker ) made it available .
That was the end of Taguba ’s Army career , however .
Several months after his report leaked , Taguba got a phone call from his boss telling him to retire .
Looking back , Taguba recently told Seymour Hersh , “ I assumed they wanted to know .
I was ignorant of the setting . ”
The general spoke of his futile attempts to get senior generals to focus on the problem of torture .
One lieutenant general was at least candid in rebuffing Taguba : “ I do n’t want to get involved because what do you do with that information , once you know ? ”
Taguba also spoke of the indignities thrown his way by Rumsfeld and martinets like Gen .
John Abizaid who , like so many other high officials  civilian , as well as military  seem to have forgotten the oath we all took to defend the Constitution of the United States .
A few weeks after his report became public , Abizaid turned to Taguba with a pointed warning : “ You and your report will be investigated . ”
Preferring to hold onto his belief in an Army led by generals with integrity , Taguba later expressed his disappointment that Abizaid would have that attitude .
Awakening to the new reality , though , Taguba let it all out in a very telling way : “ I had been in the Army 32 years by then , and it was the first time that I thought I was in the Mafia . ”
This article first appeared on ConsortiumNews.org .
After a summer of catastrophic flooding in Britain , it would be encouraging to see the conference season as an opportunity for British politicians to move from the highly rhetorical to the real in their climate change policies .
The reaction of some Conservatives , however , to the relatively modest suggestion that airport expansion in Britain should be halted , or that those who pollute should pay , is a reminder that there are still people who suffer from the delusion that doing nothing on climate is an option , or that inaction will somehow guarantee that things stay the same .
Eric Rode Frederiksen knows different .
Eric is rotund , white - haired - and clear - eyed on the subject of climate change .
He was born 80 years ago in the village of Qassiarsuk in Subarctic Greenland , where an earlier Eric , the Nordic Viking Eric the Red , first established a colony in the 10th century .
One legend has it that Eric was so desperate to entice others to join him that he lied about the inhospitable nature of the vast island of rocky mountains and deep valleys .
He sent word that he had found a " green land " fit for settlement .
Fifteen ships did follow him , and the Viking settlement lasted nearly 500 years .
The legend does Eric a disservice .
The slopes the Vikings settled were , indeed , green , and the accumulated topsoil testifies to long periods of fertility in the past .
Eric and his people farmed sheep and grew potatoes , supplementing their diets with fishing and hunting .
It was when the climate cooled , 400 years later , narrowing the margin of possible agriculture in southern Greenland to zero , that the Viking settlement failed and farming disappeared for 500 years .
In the 20th century , Eric Rode Frederikse 's father became the first Greenlander since the Vikings to give sheep farming another go .
Today , 65 families are making a living as farmers in southern Greenland , the growing season is a month longer than before , and people have begun to plant little gardens .
This summer , they tasted their first Greenland - grown broccoli .
As the Vikings failed in the south , in north Greenland the Inuit were thriving , equipped with effective technology and the hunting skills needed to live off the rich Arctic animal life .
But two years ago , for the first time , the Greenland government had to fly dog food to the far north , emergency relief for the starving hunting dogs of the Arctic Circle .
Today , Greenland 's Inuit hunting communities are facing extinction .
The uneven effects of climate change are not lost on the Greenlanders .
If the ice loss is a disaster for the Arctic hunters , Greenland as a whole is sitting , literally , on a gold mine .
The gold is already being mined , and other resources are beckoning from the melting ice fields .
Oil majors are quartering the territory , looking for fresh supplies .
The aluminium giant , Alcoa , is negotiating to open three smelters in Greenland to take advantage of a bonanza in hydro- electric power .
In settlements inside the Arctic Circle , where thousands of dogs still sit tethered and restless , waiting for ice that no longer comes , Greenlanders are about to be catapulted into an industrial age .
They have little choice but to adapt .
In the Arctic , the mirror of life for the rest of the planet , things are now changing at a dizzying pace that far outstrips the cautious estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or even the expert assessments of the Arctic Council .
For instance , the sea around Ilulissat , the biggest town in Arctic Greenland , always froze between December and the end of May .
It has not frozen at all for the last three years .
The IPCC predicted an ice - free Arctic by the end of the century ; some scientists now predict it for 2020 .
Ten years ago , it was thought that the Greenland ice cap - 11,000 feet high in some places - would take centuries to melt .
Now , the pace of melting of the ice cap , and the unpredictable interaction of the feedback loops such melting may trigger , makes any firm prediction hazardous .
In Greenland they know human civilisation is already entering unknown territory .
Robert Corell , a US - based Arctic scientist and member of the IPCC , described what he had found three weeks ago on a visit to the ice cap .
" I spent four months on the ice cap in 1968 and there was no melting at all , " he told participants in the Symposium on Religion , Science and Environment in Greenland this week .
" Now it 's dramatic .
There are thousands of moulins - holes that go down into the ice .
You can hear water roaring and gurgling .
Nobody knows now how quickly it will melt , but the palaeo - data tells us that at three degrees warmer than at present , the ice cap will melt .
The projections for global temperature increases are now between three and four degrees . "
Greenlanders have waited a long time for prosperity and , bizarrely , climate change may bring it , ending the need for the present annual subsidy from Denmark of $ 10,500 a year for each of Greenland 's 55,000 inhabitants - equivalent to roughly half the Greenland national budget .
Future economic promise is fuelling an independence movement ; but for the rest of the world , Greenland 's melting ice threatens catastrophe .
So vast is the Greenland ice sheet that it works as a regional air conditioner .
The albedo effect - the reflection of 80 % of the sun 's heat by the snow and ice - keeps temperatures in the region cool .
But as the ice melts , the dark seas and the bare rock surface absorb heat , further accelerating melting and triggering sea level rises that will inundate , among other places , the Nile Delta , much of San Francisco and 40 % of Bangladesh .
Arctic scientists are having to tear up their recent predictions and start again .
" This is all unprecedented in the science , " Corell explains .
" Until recently we did n't believe it possible , for instance , for water to permeate a glacier all the way to the bottom .
But that 's what 's happening .
As the water pools , it opens more areas of ice to melting . "
" For the last 10,000 years , " Corell says , " we have been living in a remarkably stable climate that has allowed the whole of human development to take place .
In all that time , through the mediaeval warming and the Little Ice Age , there was only a variation of 1C .
Now we see the potential for sudden changes of between 2C and 6C .
We just do n't know what the world is like at those temperatures .
We are climbing rapidly out of mankind 's safe zone into new territory , and we have no idea if we can live in it . "

BERLIN -- Hundreds of German police used antiterrorism laws yesterday to raid the offices and apartments of activists they suspect may disrupt next month 's Group of Eight summit with firebombings and other attacks .
Security officials also announced tighter border controls ahead of the June 6 - 8 summit in the northern resort town of Heiligendamm .
Some 900 federal and local police officers in Berlin and other cities searched about 40 offices and apartments used by left - wing activists and groups opposed to globalization , they said .
Prosecutors said they are investigating more than 18 people suspected of organizing a group that plans to carry out firebombings and other violence to hinder the summit of world leaders .
" The militant extreme left groups and their members are suspected of having founded a terrorist group , or of being members of such an organization , with the specific goal of staging fire bombings and other violent attacks in order to disrupt or prevent the upcoming G - 8 summit in Heiligendamm , " federal prosecutors said in a statement .
Germany 's interior ministry announced it will tighten border controls to screen out violent protesters .
People can usually travel freely within the European Union but individual countries maintain the right to tighten checks for security purposes .
Violence has marred past summits , particularly in 2001 in Genoa , Italy , when police and protesters clashed in the streets for days .
Federal prosecutors said the raids focused on dismantling a computer server by which they said many leftist groups maintained websites and mailing lists .
Activists , who will hold approved marches in nearby Rostock ahead of the summit , said the raids were aimed at silencing protests against the G - 8 , disrupting communication among antiglobalization groups , and tracking down the names of individuals involved in them .
Some groups that were targeted in the raid plan to block roads leading to Heiligendamm on June 6 to prevent politicians , journalists , and service staff from reaching the summit , one activist said .
" The consequences of these searches for us is that it will bring the groups closer together and we will continue to mobilize for a massive blockade of the G - 8 summit , " said Tim Laumeyer , a member of the Anti-Fascist Leftists of Berlin .
Police took copies of the group 's mailing lists and data on their computers .
Investigators also searched apartments , a photo archive , left - wing publishing houses , and community centers .
" The goal of the raids was to collect information about potential disruptions during the G - 8 and intimidate activists ahead of the summit , " said Christoph Kliesing , a lawyer for the protesters .
A member of Gipfelsoli Infogruppe , a group that collects and spreads information about protests against the G - 8 , said its

Science & Exploration ESA seeks candidates for simulated ' Missions to Mars ' in 2008/ 2009
19/06/2007 1403 views 6 likes
ESA is preparing for future human exploration missions to Mars .
We are currently looking for volunteers to take part in a 520 - day simulated Mars mission .
To go to Mars is still a dream and one of the last gigantic challenges .
But one day some of us will be on precisely that journey to the Red Planet .
A journey with no way out once the spaceship is on a direct path to Mars .
Challenges
These men and women will have to take care of themselves for almost two years during the roundtrip .
Their survival is in their own hands , relying on the work of thousands of engineers and scientists back on Earth , who made such a mission possible .
The crew will experience extreme isolation and confinement .
They will lose sight of planet Earth .
A radio contact will take 40 minutes to travel to us and then back to the space explorers .
A human mission to Mars is a bold vision for the time beyond the International Space Station .
However , preparations have already started today .
They are geared and committed to one goal : to send humans on an exploration mission to Mars , individuals who will live and work together in a spaceship for over 500 days .
Simulation
In order to investigate the human factors of such a mission , ESA has teamed up with the Russian Institute of Biomedical Problems ( IBMP ) and will send a joint crew of six on a 520 - day simulated mission to Mars .
The simulation follows the mission profile of a real Mars mission , including an exploration phase on the surface of Mars .
Nutrition will be identical to that provided on board the International Space Station .
The simulations will take place here on Earth inside a special facility in Moscow .
A precursor 105 - day study is scheduled to start by mid-2008 , possibly followed by another 105 - day study , before the full 520 - day study begins in late 2008 or early 2009 .
ESA is looking for 12 volunteers who are ready to participate in the simulations and thereby help to support the preparations of the real thing : a mission to Mars .
Four volunteers will be needed for each of the three simulations .
The selection procedure is similar to that of ESA astronauts , although there will be more emphasis on psychological factors and stress resistance than on physical fitness .
Interested ?

Concordia Alongside such dedicated space mission simulations , a complementary approach to understand the complexities of human health and behaviour is to look at analogue environments .
These are operational environments , which , through their natural situation produce some similar constraints as for example a mission to Mars .
ESA has already been active for some years in the Antarctic Concordia research station .
In support of the scientific and technical projects there , ESA is looking for one person ( each year ) with a medical background .

The old cliché " You 're not paranoid if they really are out to get you " turns out to apply quite nicely to the world of P2P file - sharing .
A trio of intrepid researchers from the University of California - Riverside decided to see just how often a P2P user might be tracked by content owners .
Their startling conclusion : " naive " users will exchange data with such " fake users " 100 percent of the time .
Anirban Banerjee , Michalis Faloutsos , and Laxmi Bhuyan collected more than 100GB of TCP header information from P2P networks back in early 2006 using a specially - doctored client .
The goal of the research was a simple one : to determine " how likely is it that a user will run into such a ' fake user ' and thus run the risk of a lawsuit ? "
The results are outlined in a recent paper ( PDF ) , " P2P : Is Big Brother Watching You ? "
For years , P2P communities have suspected that affiliates of the RIAA , the MPAA , and others have been haunting P2P networks to look for those who might be swapping copyrighted files .
It 's more than a hunch ; it 's well documented that companies like SafeNet ( formerly Media Sentry ) engage in this sort of work , and that their testimony is routinely produced at trials .
It helped to bring down Jammie Thomas , in fact .
But identifying these organizations is hard .
The nature of their business is to remain shadowy , but P2P advocates have spent years compiling " blocklists " of IP ranges that are suspected of belonging to such companies .
Connect to a " user " who has an IP address in one of the blocklists and bam : you 've just been tracked swapping a file .
By parsing all of the TCP headers that they collected over the course of 90 days , the UC - Riverside researchers came to several conclusions :
If you do n't use a blocklist , you will be tracked .
Every one of the researchers ' test clients that did not use a blocklist soon connected to an IP address found within those lists .
It turns out that 12 to 17 percent of all IP addresses on the network belonged to these blocklisted ranges .
Trackers are n't that hard to avoid .
While " naive " clients may all connect to blocklisted users , it was n't that hard to stay away from the vast majority of such " fake users . "
Researchers found that " avoiding just the top 5 blocklisted IPs reduces the chance of being tracked to about 1 percent . "
Content owners hide their tracks .
Much of this tracking work is farmed out from content owners to companies like SafeNet and BayTSP , and these companies in turn take care to hide their tracks .
When the researchers ran reverse DNS lookups on the blocklisted ranges , they found that only 0.5 percent of those addresses resolved back to media companies in an obvious way .
Meet the BOGONS .
One of the strategies for remaining anonymous is to operate from BOGON IP ranges .
These ranges are unallocated blocks of addresses that should ordinarily not be used on the public Internet .
Of the top fifteen blocklist entities that were discovered during testing , 12 were in BOGON ranges .
The researchers note that " these sources deliberately wish to conceal their identities while serving files on P2P networks , " and reverse DNS queries on these addresses produce little useful information .
The takeaway here is simple : P2P users who do n't utilize the blocklists are just about guaranteed to be tracked by " fake users " operating out of those ranges , and thus seem to open the door to possible litigation should the dice be rolled against them .
The study does have one major caveat , however ; it does not attempt to determine if the blocklists actually correspond to tracking organizations like SafeNet .
The researchers note that " this would be interesting and challenging future work . "
While using a blocklist makes it easy to avoid connecting to IP addresses found on that list , it 's not clear that every range on the lists is really a tracker .
Conversely , there 's no way to know if addresses not on the list might in fact be tracking users .
Holy smokes !

Published : Thursday May 24 , 2007 Print This Email This
During an interview on MSNBC News Thursday , Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) expressed his disappointment with the lack of timelines in the Iraq War funding bill , but held back from bashing his fellow senators .
" I 'm not just taking aim at Democrats , " Feingold said .
" This is George Bush 's war . "
" This is no time to back off , " insisted Feingold .
" We need to get back on track to end this war , because the American people want that . "
In response to a question about whether there might be more support for imposing timelines next September , he answered , " You know what 's going to happen in September ?
They 'll bring General Petraeus back and he 'll say just give me to the end of the year ...
A thousand more troops will lose their lives ....
This should not wait till September . "

The growing problem of accessing old digital file formats is a " ticking time bomb " , the chief executive of the UK National Archives has warned .
Natalie Ceeney said society faced the possibility of " losing years of critical knowledge " because modern PCs could not always open old file formats .
She was speaking at the launch of a partnership with Microsoft to ensure the Archives could read old formats .
Microsoft's UK head , Gordon Frazer , warned of a looming " digital dark age " .
He added : " Unless more work is done to ensure legacy file formats can be read and edited in the future , we face a digital dark hole . "
Research by the British Library suggests Europe loses 3bn euros each year in business value because of issues around digital preservation .
The National Archives , which holds 900 years of written material , has more than 580 terabytes of data - the equivalent of 580,000 encyclopaedias - in older file formats that are no longer commercially available .
Ms Ceeney said : " If you put paper on shelves , it 's pretty certain it is going to be there in a hundred years .
" If you stored something on a floppy disc just three or four years ago , you 'd have a hard time finding a modern computer capable of opening it .
" Digital information is in fact inherently far more ephemeral than paper , " warned Ms Ceeney .
She added : " The pace of software and hardware developments means we are living in the world of a ticking time bomb when it comes to digital preservation .
Historically within the IT industry the prevailing trend was for proprietary file formats
Gordon Frazer , Microsoft
" We cannot afford to let digital assets being created today disappear .
We need to make information created in the digital age to be as resilient as paper . "
But Ms Ceeney said some digital documents held by the National Archives had already been lost forever because the programs which could read them no longer existed .
" We are starting to find an awful lot of cases of what has been lost .
What we have got to make sure is that it does n't get any worse . "
The root cause of the problem is the range of proprietorial file formats that proliferated during the early digital revolution .
Technology companies , such as Microsoft , used file formats which were not only incompatible with pieces of software from rival firms , but also between different iterations of the same program .
Mr Frazer said Microsoft had shifted its position on file formats .
" Historically within the IT industry , the prevailing trend was for proprietary file formats .
We have worked very hard to embrace open standards , specifically in the area of file formats . "
Microsoft has developed a new document file format , called Open XML , which is used to save files from programs such Word , Excel and Powerpoint .
Mr Frazer said : " It 's an open international standard under independent control .
These are no longer under control of Microsoft and are free for access by all . "
But some critics question Microsoft 's approach and ask why the firm has created its own new standard , rather than adopting a rival system , called the Open Document Format .
Instead , Microsoft has released a tool which can translate between the two formats .
Ben Laurie , director of the Open Rights Group , said : " This is a well - known , standard Microsoft move .
" Microsoft likes lock - ins .
Typically , what happens is that you end up with two or three standards . "
The agreement between the National Archives and Microsoft centres on the use of virtualisation .
The archive will be able to read older file formats in the format they were originally saved by running emulated versions of the older Windows operating systems on modern PCs .
Data on floppy discs may be in unreadable formats
For example , if a Word document was saved using Office 97 under Windows 95 , then the National Archives will be able to open that document by emulating the older operating system and software on a modern machine .
Ms Ceeney said the issue of older file formats was a bigger problem than reading outdated forms of media , such as floppy discs of various sizes and punch cards .
" The media it is stored in is not relevant .
Back - up is important , but back - up is not preservation . "
Adam Farquhar , head of e-architecture at the British Library , praised Microsoft for its adoption of more open standards .
He said : " Microsoft has taken tremendous strides forward in addressing this problem .
There has been a sea change in attitude . "
He warned that the issue of digital preservation did not just affect National Archives and libraries .
" It 's everybody - from small businesses to university research groups and authors and scientists .
" It 's a huge challenge for anyone who keeps digital information for more than 15 years because you are talking about five different technology generations . "
The British Library and National Archives are members of the Planets project which brings together European National Libraries and Archives and technology companies to address the issue of digital preservation .
He said that open file formats were an important step but there was still work to be done .
" Automation is a key area to work on .
We need to be able to convert hundreds and even thousands of documents at a time , " he said .
My Silicon Valley Job History
When I first started this blog , I thought I would use it as a chance to talk about what it was like to live and work in a place like Silicon Valley .
So to commemorate my first year blog anniversary ( this week ) , I thought I ’d do a post like this for the fun of it .
I ’d like to start by saying that this is why I like being anonymous : so that I may be able to safely share some things about the places I ’ve worked for in the past , as well as comment on whom I ’ve worked for without having to fear undesirable “ repercussions ” .
One of the perks of living and working in the Bay Area is to have the opportunity to be a part of the booming trades of Silicon Valley .
It ’s true that our cost of living is one of the many challenges of living in this area .
It is also true , from my observation that the middle class in this part of the nation is getting squeezed harder and harder .
It ’s almost as if our middle class is eroding since it ’s beginning to look like this place is split between the haves and have nots and those in the middle are pulled in one direction or the other depending on how the cards have fallen for them in the last couple of decades .
At any rate , most of the professionals who work for the technical industry are the middle class , and they are the lifeblood of this place .
Many can be found toiling for long hours at their decent , well - paying jobs that are required to keep themselves financially afloat in this grossly overvalued part of the world .
Some of the most memorable highs and lows I ’ve experienced at work have been as an ordinary — and by all accounts — average employee in the following companies which shall remain nameless outside of the clues below .
[ It ’s easy enough to figure out actually . ]
What ’s My Job History Like ?
The Bosses .
Here are the some photos of previous people I ’ve worked for .
I ’m happy to report that none of these people chewed up and spit out my soul … .
I actually enjoyed working at these companies which these big bosses have helped create .
You can read more about these men and the companies they ’ve built , in these books :
The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison : * God Does n’t Think He ’s Larry Ellison
You ’re Fifty –Now What ?
Investing for the Second Half of Your Life
Guide to Financial Independence : Simple Solutions for Busy People
John Chambers and the Cisco Way : Navigating Through Volatility
Bill & Dave : How Hewlett and Packard Built the World ’s Greatest Company
Well , okay , I ’ve given away some of the names here , but let ’s just play along , shall we ?
The Stock Price Meltdowns .
All these companies had their stock gravely affected by the dot com bust and subsequent bear market .
( a) Company A : Hit a high of over $ 45 per share in late 2000 , currently the price is at a little over $ 21 per share .
( b) Company B : Hit a high of over $ 70 a share in late 1999 , with current price at under $ 50 a share .
( c) Company C : Hit a high of $ 80 a share in late 1999 , with current price at around $ 33 a share .
(d) Company D : Hit a high of over $ 50 per share in early 1999 and the current stock price is now at around $ 22 a share .
What ’s amazing is how some of these stocks have hit the same exact high price point at exactly the same point in time while none have fully recovered their once lofty stock price levels .
If you bought any of these stocks 7 or 8 years ago and held on , you ’ve unfortunately been carrying dead wood .
The Fun Experiences .
It was n’t always this way with the stock prices though .
There was once a time when these companies had unbelievable high P.E. ratios and soaring stock price valuations .
Today , with their stocks in the dust , you can at least count on these places for the great perks and benefits they still offer [ free gym membership , telecommuting privileges , on site daycare ! ] along with a wealth of valuable learning experiences .
Some memorable experiences I ’ve had in each company :
( a) Company A was the incubator that churned out a lot of former engineers who eventually became active participants in the internet age as founders for successful startups at a later time .
Even several people I knew who stayed put in this company became very well rewarded and eventually climbed up the executive ladder to hold places of seniority ( no , I did not share the same fate ) .
Notable as well was that I started my job here before Netscape existed , which meant that this was a time when there were no internet GUIs , when all consoles were character based and we could only entertain ourselves with Usenet .
( b) Company B was a great place to work , with a lot of young managers foisting a very friendly workplace culture upon us workers .
I recall one guy who did n’t do squat and somehow B.S ’d his way into making people do his work while simultaneously taking credit for it .
He was also just a regular engineer , but after a dozen years , I was more than surprised to find that he now heads the San Francisco chapter of a prominent angel funding firm .
Well , with his excellent persuasive and negotiating skills , maybe I should n’t have been too surprised .
( c) Company C outsourced a lot of their work to foreign contractors , and turned out to be extremely successful .
I remember the hard hours and many great friendships that I made .
Despite the work load and pressure , hard - driving management , 24 hour support calls on top of the development time we put in during the day , I have a keen pride and fondness for this place .
This place turned out to be a giant in its industry , as one responsible for the foundation of the internet as we know it today .
It had clout as if it were the Google of its time , going on acquisition sprees and turning everything it touched into gold .
(d) Company D was a highly politically charged place that had a lot of “ strange ” people in it .
I ended up in a team whose team lead became entangled in a complex sexual harrassment case with one of our team members .
I did n’t realize how disruptive such a situation can turn out for everyone else in a work group when this kind of thing happens .
I was just glad I left the place right after that .
Still , I have to credit this place for helping me learn Java in its earliest release .
The Commutes .
Two of my commutes ran between 20 to 30 minutes , one way , and they were relatively short .
The others were a bear : over an hour for each one , door - to - door , and in the late 1990 ’s it was even more horrendous when traffic packed the interstate highways courtesy of the technical job boom .
Today , my dream is to find a job that takes me under 15 minutes to get to , but that ’s pretty much close to impossible just given where I ’m located .
Unless you live smack in a city that has these jobs , commuting will be a fixture in life .
The Salaries .
I received standard base salaries for engineers in the West Coast .
There was this premium paid during the dot com era which is probably around 50 % more of what we get today .
-ooOoo -
Now that I ’ve spilled some beans , you may get a feel for the companies we have around here , which you ’ll realize is n’t much different from many other large companies elsewhere :) .
I hope that these were remotely interesting anecdotes from our corner of the world .
Many more titillating skeletons in the closet abound around here but I ’ll leave it to Valleywag and TechCrunch to do this job . 🙂
Blog Anniversary Giveaway !
Which brings me to one other reason why I wrote this post : this week , I am celebrating my first year blog anniversary and this post figures in that celebration !
I am holding a contest ( e.g. “ a giveaway ” in blogosphere parlance ) to mark this occasion , and if you ’d like a headstart in joining , please comment on this post and share with us your own funny , interesting , sad , wacky work , job or business related experience that you ’d like .
In fact , you can tell us anything about your occupation , past or present .
I ’ll be covering the details of this giveaway tomorrow !

Witches have long been feared and hated in Christian circles .
Even today , pagans and Wiccans remain a target of Christian persecution , especially in America .
It seems that they long ago took on an identity which reached far beyond their own existence and became a symbol for Christians — but a symbol of what ?
Maybe an examination of the events will give us some clues .
Using the Inquisition to Suppress Dissent and Outsiders Source : Jupiter Images
The creation of the concept of devil - worship , followed by its persecution , allowed the church to more easily subordinate people to authoritarian control and openly denigrate women .
Most of what was passed off as witchcraft were simply fictional creations of the church , but some of it was genuine or almost - genuine practices of pagans and Wiccans .
As the Inquisition proceeded through the 1400s , its focus shifted from Jews and heretics towards so - called witches .
Although Pope Gregory IX had authorized the killing of witches back in the 1200s , the fad just did n't catch on .
In 1484 , Pope Innocent VIII issued a bull declaring that witches did indeed exist and thus it became a heresy to believe otherwise .
This was quite a reversal because in 906 the Canon Episcopi , a church law , declared that belief in the existence and operation of witchcraft was heresy .
The additional persecution of anything which resembled feminine religiosity went to interesting lengths in that devotion to Mary became suspect .
Today the figure of Mary is both popular and important in the Catholic church , but to the Inquisition , it was a possible sign of overemphasizing the feminine aspect of Christianity .
In the Canary Islands , Aldonca de Vargas was reported to the Inquisition for nothing more than smiling at hearing mention of Mary .
As a result of this , church authorities tortured and killed thousands of women , and not a few men , in an effort to get them to confess that they flew through the sky , had sexual relations with demons , turned into animals , and engaged in various sorts of black magic .
The image here depicts what Christians imagined went on at a court of witches where Satan presided .
People typically fear that which they do n't understand , so witches were doubly damned : they were feared because they were allegedly agents of Satan seeking to undermine Christian society and they were feared because no one really knew what witches did or how .
In the place of real knowledge or information , Christian leaders made things up and created stories which were certain to cause people to hate and fear witches even more .
People trusted their religious and political leaders to provide them with accurate information , but in reality , the " information " provided was simply whatever furthered their leaders religious and political goals .
Creating an enemy of out witches served the goal of increased religious and political cohesion because people would want to draw closer together in order to confront the enemy who wanted to destroy them .
Is n't that ultimately more important than whether the stories were true or not ?
Witches ' Sabbath : Church Depictions of Witches and Witchcraft Source : Jupiter Images Portrayals of witchcraft in church records can be very amusing .
Almost everything that was " known " at the time about witches was pure fiction , inventions by church authorities who were told that witches were a threat and so had to come up with something to describe .
Their creations have passed on into popular cultural images of witches which continue to this day .
Very little of people 's understanding of witches has anything to do with older , pagan traditions which supposedly were the source of witches and witchcraft .
Most clerics seem to have been rather limited in creativity , so witches were shown as behaving a simplistically opposite fashion from Christians .
Since Christians kneeled , then witches stood on their heads when paying homage to their masters .
Communion was parodied by a Black Mass .
Catholic sacraments became excrement .
The above image depicts some of the strange and crazy things which medieval Christians believed that witched did at night .
One of the most famous symbols of the Inquisition 's witch - craze was the publication of the Malleus Maleficarum ( Witches ' Hammer ) by Jakob Sprenger and Heinrich Kramer .
These two Dominican monks wrote a lurid account of what witches were " really " like and what they " really " did -- an account which would rival modern science fiction in its creativity , not to mention its fictitiousness .
It 's not too far from the truth to suggest that Sprenger and Kramer were early propagandists , creating a fake resource for authorities in order to help justify what the authorities wanted to do all along .
Sprenger and Kramer told religious leaders what they wanted to hear and helped make it easier for those leaders to pursue the persecution of witches throughout Europe .
The political and religious goals set down by the church leaders were deemed far more important than the consequences to their own values , principles , or morals -- and certainly more important than the possible persecution of anyone who might actually be innocent of the charges leveled against them .
Witchcraft and Satanism : Witches Kissing Satan Source : Jupiter Images Christians in medieval and pre-modern Europe believed that Satan was a real being and that Satan was actively involved in the affairs of humans .
Satan 's goal was the corruption of humanity , the destruction of everything good , and the damnation of as many people as possible in hell .
One means by which it was believed he accomplished this was through human agents to whom he gave supernatural powers .
Witches were easily categorized as servants of Satan .
No longer merely adherents to a more ancient religious tradition , witches were targeted for prosecution as slaves of the cosmic enemy of God , Jesus , and Christianity .
Instead of a healer or a teacher , the witch was made into an instrument of evil .
The witch was portrayed -- and treated -- as worse than a heretic .
This tactic was not limited to the medieval church 's pursuit of witches .
Religious and political authorities of various eras and different cultures have always found it convenient to associate their enemies with the worst possible evil they could imagine .
In the Christian west , this generally meant associating enemies with Satan .
These sort of extreme demonization allows a person to stop seeing their enemy as entirely human and the conflict as something which does not require mercy , traditionally just procedures , or anything of the kind .
The only just outcome is not merely the defeat the one 's enemy , but their complete extermination .
In a battle where one 's very existence is at stake , survival becomes the only moral value worth upholding .
The above image depicts the " Witch 's Kiss . "
It was believed that part of the rite of becoming a witch in Satan 's service involved kissing Satan 's rear .
It should be remembered that insofar as there existed anyone who practiced the healing and divination techniques of older pagan traditions , they would n't have had anything to do with Satan .
After all , Satan is a creation of Christianity and monotheistic traditions .
Any " witches " who existed were pantheists or polytheists and would n't have believed in a Satan .
Persecuting Witches and Persecuting Women Source : Jupiter Images
The subservience of women to men was a common theme in early Christian writings -- an outgrowth of both traditional patriarchal attitudes and the extreme hierarchical nature of the church itself .
Groups which did not hold to hierarchy in any form were attacked immediately .
There is no shared authority between the genders in traditional Christianity , either in the church or in the home .
Homosexuality would be particularly threatening to this ideology , as it raises the potential of redefining gender roles , especially in the home .
Witness how the recent attacks upon homosexuality in society has progressed hand - in - hand with the mindless promotion of vague " traditional family values , " particularly those which " put women in their place " and reinforce male dominance in the home .
With a married couple of two women or two men , who exactly is supposed to be in charge and who meekly obedient ?
Never mind that the Christians who fear such relationships will never be asked to make those decisions themselves -- the mere fact that people are making such decisions on their own rather than obeying someone else 's religious proclamations is quite enough to give them fits of apoplexy .
The perception of women as inferior to men , and possibly the enemy of proper religious or social order , has survived down through this day in the most conservative and fundamentalist religious movements around the world .
Religious institutions and doctrines are a primary repository for ancient beliefs about the social , physical , political , and religious inferiority of women .
Even if the rest of society is moving on and improving women 's status , religion remains the main source of beliefs and attitudes which retard that progress in the hopes of reversing it completely .
And , where women cannot be attacked directly , they are attacked indirectly through negative stereotypes about " feminine " values as compared to positive stereotypes of " manly " or " masculine " traits .
It would be a mistake to assert that the Christian persecution of witches and witchcraft was nothing but an attempt to suppress women and feminine influences .
Christian society , politics , and theology at the time simply were n't that simplistic .
At the same time , it 's hard to overestimate the role of misogynistic attitudes and repressed male sexuality played in the persecution of witches .
It seems likely that if they did n't exist , the extreme violence directed at women and alleged witches probably would n't have occurred .
Witches , Misogyny , and Patriarchy : Clerical Torture of Women Source : Jupiter Images
The persecution of witches reached its zenith at a time when Christianity 's attitudes against sex had long since turned into full - blown misogyny .
It is amazing how celibate men became obsessed with the sexuality of women .
As it is stated in Malleus Maleficarum : " All witchcraft comes from carnal lust , which is in women insatiable . "
Another section describes how witches were known to " ... collect male organs in great numbers , as many as twenty or thirty members together , and put them in a bird 's nest . "
Evidently , they were not entirely stingy with their collections -- there is the story of a man who went to a witch to have his lost penis restored : " She told the afflicted man to climb a certain tree , and that he might take which he like out of a nest in which there were several members .
And when he tried to take a big one , the witch said :
You must not take that one ; adding , because it belonged to a parish priest . "
And some people say that religion is n't really all about wishful thinking !
These sentiments were nothing unique or unusual -- indeed , they are a result of centuries of mean - spirited sexual pathology on the part of church theologians .
The philosopher Boethius , for example , wrote in The Consolation of Philosophy that " Woman is a temple built upon a sewer . "
Later , in the tenth century , Odo of Cluny stated :
To embrace a woman is to embrace a sack of manure .
Women were regarded as impediments to true spirituality and union with God , which helps explain why investigators focused on women more than men .
The church had a long - standing prejudice against women , and this was given vent when the doctrine of devil worship was emphasized as an enemy which the church had to confront and destroy .
This animus has n't entirely disappeared even today .
Women are n't persecuted and tortured , but they are deliberately kept out of positions of authority and responsibility reserved exclusively for men .
Under Torture , Accused Witches Would Confess to Almost Anything Source : Jupiter Images Confessions of witchcraft , extracted under torture or threat of torture , commonly came attached to denouncements of other possible witches , keeping the Inquisitors in business .
In Spain , church records tell the story of Maria of Ituren admitting under torture that she and sister witches turned themselves into horses and galloped through the sky .
In a district of France , 600 women admitted to copulating with demons .
Some entire villages in Europe were may have been exterminated .
Although the children of heretics and Jews had never experienced much in the way of mercy from Inquisitors , the children of convicted witches suffered even more horribly .
These kids were themselves prosecuted for witchcraft — girls after the age of nine and a half , boys after the age of ten and a half .
Even younger children could be tortured to elicit testimony against parents .
A French judge is reported to have regretted being so lenient when he sentenced young kids to be flogged while they watched their parents burn instead of sentencing them to burn as well .
Children may not be easily culpable for heresy or their parents ' heresy , but they could certainly be influenced by or even possessed by Satan .
The only hope of saving their souls was to torture their bodies to drive out the satanic influences .
Voluntary testimony from someone as young as two could be admitted despite it not being treated as valid in other cases .
This was a sign of just how serious the threat of witches was perceived to be .
Witches and witchcraft , both of which were in the service of Satan , threatened the very existence of Christian society , the Christian church , and Christians themselves .
Normal standards of justice , evidence , and trials were abandoned because no one wanted to take the chance that respecting traditional rights and standards would allow the guilty to escape punishment .
How the Torture of Witches Revealed the Sexual Repression of Inquisitors Source : Jupiter Images Interrogations of witches followed many standard Inquisition procedures , but with some added bonuses .
Accused witches were all stripped naked , had all of their body hair shaved off , and then " pricked . "
The sexually neurotic Malleus Maleficarum had become the standard text on how to deal with witches , and this book stated authoritatively that all witches bore a numb " devil 's mark " which could be detected by sharp prodding .
Inquisitors were also quick to search for the purported " witches ' tits , " blemishes which were supposed to be extra nipples used by witches to suckle demons .
Red - hot tongs were applied to womens ' breasts and genitalia .
Researcher Nancy van Vuuren has written that " The women 's sex organs provided special attraction for the male torturer . "
It should not be surprising that just about every torture victim eventually confessed .
Effectiveness of Sexual Torture
When people are tortured , and especially when the torture involves sexual abuse , it does n't take long for the victim 's world to become reduced to nothing but the pain and a desire for the pain to end .
When the only important thing is the cessation of pain , the victim will tell the torturer whatever they want to hear .
It may not be the truth , but if the pain ends that 's all that matters .
Blaming the Victims of Sexual Torture
If the men interrogating the witches were to become aroused , it was assumed that the desire originated not in them , but instead was a projection from the women .
Women were supposed to be highly sexually - charged beings , while the celibate Inquisitors were supposed to be beyond such matters .
Of course , the women were expected to admit that they were causing the interrogators to become sexually aroused , leading to a new round of questions and possible torture .
Sex and Interrogation of Witches Source : Jupiter Images
If witches and witchcraft have become imbued with an identity that reaches far beyond their own existence if they have become a symbol for something larger for Christians , then what are they a symbol of ?
It seems to me that witches served a symbolic role for the male , celibate religious authorities in Europe .
Witches were not simply adherents to an alternative religiosity , and they certainly were n't turning whole towns into toads .
Indeed , most of those accused of witchcraft almost certainly was n't guilty of anything of the sort .
Instead , their treatment at the hands of men , and the rationales used by those men indicate that the oppression of witches was somehow symbolic of the oppression of women in general , of women 's sexuality , and of sexuality in general .
I hate to sound Freudian , but I really do think that in this case , the assertions by celibate men about the alleged sexual obsessions of witches are really a clear case of projection .
I think that it was the religious authorities who were obsessed and insatiable with their sexuality , but since their repressive ideology could n't allow that , they had to project their desires onto others .
If women , sexually evil beasts , were actually responsible for the priests ' sexual desires , then the priests could in turn still feel holy -- and better yet , " holier than thou , " more righteous and holy than the hated women around them .
When one group is systematically persecuted by others , and especially when the persecutors deliberately abandon normal standards of justice , procedures , and so forth , then it 's important to look at whether the persecutors are just reacting to a perceived threat ( real or imagined ) or if they are instead reacting to something larger and using the victims as a scapegoat for larger fears .
Sometimes both may be at work , too .
Joan of Arc , Witch and Heretic Source : Jupiter Images Although accusations of witchcraft seem to have been most commonly made against older women who lived on the margins of society and who may have become socially troublesome , there is also evidence that women who were too powerful could become targets as well .
Joan of Arc is one famous example of a woman who achieved a great deal but was then burned as a witch for her trouble .
Joan of Arc , who has become the patron saint of France , was a peasant girl who experienced mystical visions of St. Michael , St. Catherine , and St. Margaret during the Hundred Years War which convinced her that she was destined by God to lead the French to victory over the English invaders .
In 1429 she convinced the Dauphin Charles VII to let her demonstrate that she had the ability to match her ambitions and she led French forces to liberate the city of Orleans from an English siege .
She was eventually taken prisoner by the Burgundians , allies of England , and turned over to the English who burned her at the stake as a witch on the argument that her claims of direct communication with God were heretical and an act of disobedience to the Church .
Not until June 16 , 1456 , did Pope Callistus III declare Joan of Arc to be innocent on the charges of heresy and witchcraft .
It can be difficult for powerful institutions to admit the error of any sort , but especially when the errors involve grave injustices that cause the suffering and death of innocent people .
Everyone likes to think of themselves are pure of heart and doing good work , even when they are hurting others .
Sometimes the need to justify one 's actions leads one to justifications of brutality , cruelty , and violence in general -- and thus a betrayal of whatever moral principles they thought they held to begin with .
Executing Witches and Eliminating Witchcraft Source : Jupiter Images Burning and hanging were the most popular forms of execution for accused witches in medieval Europe .
Burning seems to have been most common in continental Europe while hanging was more common in Britain -- and thus also in the American colonies later as well .
The death penalty was imposed on a wide variety of crimes in this era , but witchcraft , in particular , was punished by death on the basis of Exodus 22:18 : " Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live " and Leviticus 20:27 : " A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit , or that is a wizard , shall surely be put to death : they shall stone them with stones . "
The heretics who were the earlier targets of the Inquisition were almost never executed at first .
They typically had a chance to repent and submit to the Church ; only after relapsing into heresy did they generally become subject to execution .
Even then , they might still be given another chance to repent .
Witches received almost the exact opposite treatment : the execution was typically applied after the first accusation and only rarely were accused witches allowed to go free after repenting .
This helps demonstrate the level of threat which the Church made out of witches and witchcraft .
Witches could n't be allowed to live no matter what -- not even if they were willing to admit all that they were accused of and fully repent .
Their evil was too much of an existential threat to Christian society and they had to be completely excised , not unlike cancer which has to be cut out lest it kill the entire body .
There was simply no tolerance or patience for the witches -- they had to be eliminated , whatever the cost .
Some have claimed that as many as nine million women were executed as witches , even though few could possibly have been truly guilty of witchcraft , and that because this represented a deliberate attempt to kill women generally it should be dubbed a " Women 's Holocaust . "
More recent research demonstrates that many accused witches were men , not just women , and that number of those executed is far lower .
Estimates today range from 60,000 to 40,000 .
Even if we are especially pessimistic , we probably can't go higher than 100,000 people killed across all Europe and over an extended period of time .
That 's obviously very bad , but not quite a " Holocaust . "
Witch Hunts and Persecution in America Source : Jupiter Images
As most Americans know , witch hunts also affected the American colonies .
The Salem Witch Trials pursued the Massachusetts Puritans have entered American consciousness as being much more than just the killing of witches .
They , like the trials of Europe , have become a symbol .
In our case , the witch trials have become a symbol of what can go wrong when mobs of ignorant people go crazy , especially when egged on by just as ignorant and / or power hungry leaders .
The Salem story began in 1692 when a few girls , who had become friendly with a slave woman named Tituba , began acting very strangely -- hysterical screaming , falling into convulsions , barking like dogs , etc .
Soon other girls began acting in a similar manner and they all must have been possessed by demons .
Three woman , including Tituba , were promptly accused of witchcraft .
The result was much like the European experience , with a chain - reaction of confessions , denouncements , and more arrests .
In an effort to help combat the witch menace , courts relaxed traditional rules of evidence and procedure -- after all , witches are a terrible menace and must be stopped .
In place of the normal rules and methods , the courts used what was common among Inquisitors in Europe -- scouring the women 's bodies for marks , numb spots , etc .
Also accepted were " spectral sources " of evidence -- if someone had a vision of a woman being a witch , that was good enough for the judges .
The people who were mostly killed were not those who submitted quickly and obediently to authorities .
Only those who were defiant or hostile were put to death .
If you admitted being a witch and repented , you had a very good chance of living .
If you denied being a witch and insisted that you had rights which must be acknowledged , you were on a quick path to execution .
Your chances were also bad if you were a woman -- especially if you were an older , deviant , troublesome or somehow disorderly woman .
In the end , nineteen people were executed , two died in prison and one man was pressed to death under rocks .
This is a better record than what we see in Europe , but that is n't saying very much .
The religious and political authorities clearly used the witch trials to impose their own ideas of order and righteousness upon the local populace .
As in Europe , violence was a tool used by religion and religious people to enforce uniformity and conformity in the face of dissent and social disorder .

The change is far more complicated and politically ambitious than it sounds , given that grocers , stuck with the bottle bill ’s grunt work , have traditionally been opposed to any expansion .
Last year ,
The Oregonian reported that , before any changes were even introduced , Joe Gilliam , president of the Northwest Grocery Association , issued this warning to a meeting of stakeholders : “ We can sit back and kill bottle bills .
We ’ve got the money to do it .
We ’ve got the political know - how to do it . ”
Image Credit ... Dwight Eschliman
Not long ago , Gilliam and I visited a store in northeast Portland together .
It was a Fred Meyer , a chain of large - scale retailers .
We met at the bottle house , a cement structure resembling a bus terminal near the edge of the parking lot .
There , people fed empties into “ reverse vending machines , ” which scanned the barcodes and issued redemptions .
An employee stood by to switch out the bins and hand - count any containers mistakenly rejected .
The store fills three trucks with empties every week .
Adding water , Gilliam speculated , would at least double that volume .
That means twice as many machines in a bottle house twice as big .
And if that happens , he said , pacing into the lot with his arms extended , you run into compliance problems with parking , access to public transportation and so on .
Some grocers also warn that funneling garbage into grocery stores has health risks .
“ The bottle bill is basically maxed out on its capacity , ” Gilliam said .
“ They ’re going to have to do something far more innovative to make it work at this point . ”
Meanwhile , as is the case in most states , Oregon ’s beverage distributors — who via the grocers , collect and refund the deposits — claim they are being defrauded .
They are refunding nickels for out - of - state containers on which they never collected a deposit in the first place .
In Portland , bottles and cans flood in from the nearby suburbs in Washington , a state with no bottle bill .
( “ Seinfeld ” fans will remember Kramer driving a mail truck full of empties to the 10 - cent Promised Land of Michigan . )
A cooperative of Oregon distributors says this fraud almost entirely cancels out , and in some years exceeds , the windfall of unclaimed deposits it gets to keep .
Bottled - water companies claim that , because water is not distributed in strict territories like soda and beer , keeping track of their nickels will be even more difficult .
In Maine , one of two states so far to expand its law to include bottled water , Nestlé Waters North America says it handed back $ 815,000 more in nickels than it collected last year .
( Globally , Nestlé owns 72 different brands of water , including Poland Spring , Deer Park and Arrowhead . )
Brian Flaherty , a Nestlé spokesman who has testified in Connecticut and Oregon , told me those states are trying to drag the water business into an already dysfunctional system .
They ’re trying to “ update the old jalopy , ” Flaherty said .
The grocery and beverage industries largely advocate relying on curbside recycling instead — the programs by which homeowners set out bins at the ends of their driveways for collection .
They argue that running a deposit program — a separate system just for beverage containers — is redundant .
It may even be counterproductive .
In Connecticut , a recycling contractor warns that placing a deposit on noncarbonated beverages , and thus inspiring more people to recycle those containers at stores , would divert at least $ 900,000 of recyclable material from the curbside bins .
Such losses of revenue can threaten the financial viability of the curbside programs altogether .
The rise of municipal curbside recycling is yet another thing the bottle bill ’s authors could n’t have predicted .
Bottle - bill proponents note that nearly half of Americans do n’t have access to curbside recycling and maintain that it does a poor job of capturing containers commonly consumed away from home , like bottled water .
But curbside still has a way of complicating their arguments , or at least of exposing just how stubbornly idealistic their vision actually is .
If the goal is to conserve resources , it seems unfair that someone who conscientiously recycles his bottles and cans at the curb rather than at the grocery store loses his nickels regardless .
I told this to Betty McLaughlin of the Container Recycling Institute , a tiny nonprofit that serves as a nerve center for bottle - bill advocates .
McLaughlin disagreed , categorically .
People drive to the grocery store regularly anyway , she said .
If they took their empties with them , and if states put deposits on even more products , the volume of curbside material would drop , and the haulers ’ trucks could make fewer trips .
That would result in a net — though small , it seems — reduction in greenhouse - gas emissions .
More important , McLaughlin said , curbside is financed by municipalities ; the bottle bill is designed to hold industry accountable for the disposal of its products .
This accountability has practical , not just philosophical , benefits : forcing companies to take back their empties has ensured they make their containers recyclable and build markets for the scrap .
( It is because of the bottle bill that fleece jackets , mattresses and carpeting are now made from recycled plastic bottles ; recycled bottles have become one of the most valuable scrap materials . )
Nevertheless , defenses of the bottle bill often boil down to an insistence that the essential rightness of its principle , the idea of producer responsibility , simply outweighs its many other costs and inconveniences — particularly since the bulk of those costs and inconveniences are borne by the industry .
That ’s only just .
TOPLINE UPDATE : Welcome Instapunditeers !
Also worth noting —
The Times has changed the headline from what you see below to “ 2005 Incomes , on Average , Still Below 2000 Peak . ”

August 25 : See the correction about the Earned Income Tax Credit , mostly offset by the effect of other credits “ kept in reserve , ” in the body of the post .
August 26 , 9:30 a.m. :
There is now a post ( “ Top Six Errors Committed by David Cay Johnston and / or the New York Times in Their Income Growth Report ” ) showing that , among many other things , my core contention at the end of this post ( “ while average pre-tax income may have fallen , average after - tax income has risen â€ ” even during the Timesâ€™ artificially induced period of analysis . ” ) is correct .
___________________________________
The New York Times has had to work very hard to make the performance of the economy during the past few years look bad .
This morning , David Cay Johnston did his part ; the link to his article will come later .
Bear with the technical stuff for a bit ; the meat will arrive shortly .
Every year , the IRS publishes information about the tax returns it received in the second preceding year .
2005 ′s tax - return data was released yesterday ( data referred to here is not linked because it is in PDFs and Excel files ; anyone who wants to see the underlying data can e-mail me ) .
Among the stats the IRS produces is one with the confusing name of “ Adjusted Gross Income Less Deficit . ”
I will call it “ Revised AGI ” for this post .
“ Revised AGI ” adds a long list of items back to taxpayers ’ reported Adjusted Gross Income ( the number at the bottom of Page 1 of the long - form 1040 ) in an attempt to approximate taxpayers ’ total income , whether it is taxed or not .
Though there are problems with the data I will note later , looking at several years of this IRS information can be a useful starting - point indicator of workers ’ , or the economy ’s , well - being .
Now try to imagine what the New York Times did with the following data :
Go ahead .
Then click “ More ” if you ’re on the home page to find out .
Here it is ( link requires free registration ; the Times ’ figure of $ 55,714 differs from the table above because of rounding ) :
The Times and Johnston chose their “ 2000 - 2005 ″ reportorial spin , even though :
The more important news by far is that the real increase in Revised AGI in both 2004 and 2005 is greater than during either of the final two good years of the Clinton economy ;
The real decreases in 2001 and 2002 occurred largely because of the bursting of the Clinton - Era dot - com bubble and the September 11 terrorist attacks .
The dot - com bubble got mentioned by the Times in the context of quotes from White House sources ( the better to make it look like excuse - making ) ; Johnston and the Times made the September 11 attacks invisible .
An obvious omission : The IRS does not include the Earned Income Credit ( EITC ) in its compilation of Revised AGI , even though the EITC represents real money that either reduces other taxes or goes directly into beneficiaries ’ pockets .
Total EITCs claimed increased from $ 19.5 billion in 2000 to $ 42.4 billion in 2005 , largely because of the credit ’s expansion in the Bush tax legislation of 2001 and 2003 .
Spread over the annual average of roughly 132 million tax returns filed during that period , the $ 22.9 billion increase in the EITC ( $ 42.4 bil minus $ 19.5 bil ) amounts to over $ 170 per return .
**************
( break in original August 21 post )
CORRECTION , August 25 :
David Cay Johnston ’s comment # 74 calls my estimate of the impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) into question .
Upon further review , he is fundamentally correct , though my numbers that follow differ slightly from those in his comment .
My error was to pick up the number of returns as the dollar amount in 2000 .
To use “ my ” famous six words — “ I was wrong .
I am sorry . ” EITC , whether refundable or merely offset against other taxes , went from $ 32.3 billion in 2000 ( $ 36.6 billion in 2005 dollars ) to $ 42.4 billion from 2000 to 2005 .
Spread the real difference of $ 5.8 billion ( $ 42.4 – $ 36.6 ) over the average 131.5 million tax returns filed in 2001 - 2005 , and you get an effect of only $ 44 per return , vs. the $ 39 Mr. Johnston ’s estimates based on what must be only the refundable portion .
I think using the gross figure is correct , but I ’m not about to quibble over $ 5 .
As to why I thought EITC was expanded in 2001 and / or 2003 , it ’s because I recall reading guidance to that effect from a lot of professional CPA - type publications at the time .
( Update :
The next two sentences were revised on August 28 for clarity )
It ’s clear that I was wrong about that and I am sorry .
Others also were , but that does n’t change my incorrectness .
But there ’s a corollary to this , which I tend to follow when making a case as I did on Tuesday :
Try to hold some supporting points in reserve in case you mess up somewhere .
Mr. Johnston helpfully pointed to one of those “ in reserve ” items in his comment # 74 —
The child tax credit , which as I recall went from $ 600 $ 500 to $ 1000 per eligible child ( 16 years of age and younger , I believe ) .
I reckoned that child tax credits should have increased pretty significantly from 2000 to 2005 , but I ignored their impact .
Mr. Johnston did not quantify that difference , nor for that matter did he quantify the effect of increases in all of the credits other than the Earned Income Tax Credit .
So I will .
Credits taken other than EITC in 2000 ( not the returns , the credits ; I double - checked :– > ) amounted to $ 37.7 billion in 2000 ( $ 42.7 billion in 2005 dollars ) , and $ 54.3 billion in 2005 .
The inflation - adjusted difference of $ 11.6 billion ( $ 54.3 – $ 42.7 ) , again spread over 131.5 average returns as per two paragraphs ago , amounts to another $ 75 per return .
For those keeping score , we ’re up to $ 132 ( $ 44 + $ 88 ) out of my original “ about $ 170 ″ that I erroneously assigned to the EITC alone .
That $ 132 is $ 38 , roughly 78 % of what I had before .
Mr. Johnston picked on the EITC number because it was quantified .
Oh well , I should have held more in reserve .
BUT ….. I did n’t quantify the other factors that follow ( the impact of the low - end 15 % to 10 % rate cut , and the effect of the across - the board rate cuts above that ) .
As I will note below , those impacts are surely greater than the $ 170 Mr. Johnston focused on , by more than enough to wipe out the difference difference in real “ gross income ” ( do n’t get me started ) Mr. Johnston uses as the basis for his report .
Note for the record that Mr. Johnston has not attempted to refute my admittedly unquantified contentions about numbers that are much bigger than my original estimate of the EITC ’s impact of $ 170 , and much bigger than my current estimate of the impact of all credits including EITC of $ 132 .
( resumption of original August 21 post )
**************
Do n’t forget the tax - rate cuts :
Now add the benefit of the Bush rate cut in the lowest bracket , which has benefited all but the very top few percent of taxpayers .
Since its inception in 2001 , that rate cut from 15 % to 10 % — never mind the reduction in higher brackets — has reduced taxes for most single filers by at least $ 350 per year , and for most joint filers by at least $ 700 .
The EITC expansion , the cut in the lowest rate just noted , and the reductions in the rates applied in higher income brackets , when combined , surely more than make up for the $ 477 difference ( $ 55,715 minus $ 55,238 ) between 2000′s and 2005′s Revised AGI amounts .
So while average pre-tax income may have fallen , average after - tax income has risen — even during the Times ’ artificially induced period of analysis .
Johnston ’s obviously agenda - driven bottom line ( see UPDATE below for a revision of this assessment ) is this :
The fact that average incomes remained lower in 2005 than five years earlier helps explain why so many Americans report feeling economic stress despite overall growth in the economy .
The growth in real incomes in the two years noted , the continuation of that growth in 2006 , and the positive impact of the Bush tax cuts all make Johnston ’s contention about the sources of whatever economic stress may exist absurd .
A more accurate revision to Johnston ’s claim would be this : “ The fact that Old Media wo n’t report the success of the economy since the Bush tax cuts took hold helps explain why so many Americans report feeling economic stress despite overall growth in the economy . ”

_________________________________________
UPDATE : I , along with other commenters , salute Mr. Johnston for responding ( see Comment 4 ) .
He also called me and was eager to explain various things to me .
I can assure you that the comment below is his ( the source IP addess for his comment made me wonder ) .
Unfortunately , I was in the midst of fixing this post , which had blown up into being all bold and had to be edited at the line - by - line HTML level , so we did n’t get into much substance .
He may call back ( I think I said that I hope he does ) , and I will let readers know what happened if he does .
In the meantime , several other commenters have made very good points in response to my post and to Johnston ’s comment .
The best , in my opinion , is from Jason at # 12 , who noted that mutual funds are required to show 1- , 3 - , 5 - and 10 - year return data for a reason , i.e. , complete context .
Though Johnston could argue that the article ’s graph covers the 1 - 3 - 5 - year issue , I do n’t think that cuts it , and I suspect that most readers here do n’t either .
By not specifically noting the stellar 4 % - plus performances in each of the past two years , it ’s almost impossible NOT to think there ’s an agenda .
Adding fuel to the fire , Johnston then doubles down by making the 5 - year result the only factor worth mentioning as relevant to how consumers feel now — again , after two really good years of income growth .
C’mon , David —
How does that get into a non-agendized article ?
People in this “ What have you done for me lately ? ” world typically are n’t thinking about where they are financially compared to four or five years ago ( unless a certain president helps them do it :–> ) .
The other point I was going to leave a comment on below , until the post blew up and had to be salvaged , is that , contrary to his contention , I was not accusing Johnston of dishonesty or lack of integrity .
Those terms , or similar ones , do not appear in my post .
Johnston says that any time you accuse a reporter of having an agenda ( as I most definitely did ) , you are in effect accusing them of dishonesty and lack of integrity .
I do n’t agree .
Let ’s leave it at this —
If David did n’t have an agenda when writing the article , I have little doubt that his editors felt like they had died and gone to heaven ( or wherever it is Times editors think they ’ll go after they die ) when his article showed up .
UPDATE 2 : Back
Talk confirms the roughed - out hypothesis in this post that thanks to EITC expansion and tax - rate reduction , after - tax income gains are very real .
I believe he ’s going to have allow more room for the line on his after - tax graph to go up after he incorporates 2005 ′s data .
UPDATE 3 : Meant to mention this much earlier — Drudge had the Times story near the top left of his home page for quite a while on Tuesday .
You would think after all these years of Times misreporting he would know better .
UPDATE 4 , Aug. 23 : Meant to note other weigh - ins earlier , but here goes — NixGuy , American Thinker , Dinocrat , Krile Files .
UPDATE 5 , Aug. 23 : Some are taking issue with Johnston ’s alleged lack of econ and stats background ( his Wiki entry is here ) .
FWIW , I do n’t think it ’s worth going there , because this is n’t about creating stats , it ’s about selective reporting on published stats , not looking for gaps in the stats , and failing to get fair and balanced thoughts from others .
I do n’t think it requires a Ph.D. I surely do n’t have one , and do n’t think I needed one to have done this post .
Johnston has clearly accomplished a lot as a journalist and has many accomplishments to be proud of .
The subject article , however , is not among them .
UPDATE 6 : On Wednesday , Tom Faranda posted an e-mail that Johnston sent him ( ca n’t tell when ) about what he ( Faranda ) wrote at his blog about Johnston ’s “ average incomes ” report the day before .
GOP Sen .
Gordon Smith calls war in Iraq ' insane ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 10 , 2007 Print This Email This Fox News , reporting Tuesday on the increasing number of Republicans in Congress criticizing the Iraq War , interviewed Senator Gordon Smith ( R - OR ) , cosponsor of a resolution for withdrawal .
Smith is known for a speech last December in which he stated , " I , for one , am at the end of my rope when it comes to supporting a policy that has our soldiers patrolling the same streets in the same way , being blown up by the same bombs day after day .
That is absurd .
It may even be criminal . "
Smith told Fox , " If I could do anything over , I would  in that speech I gave  I would replace the word ' criminal ' with the word ' insane . ' "
He suggested that the " surge " might have had a chance of working four years ago , but said , " On my numerous visits to Iraq ... each time I go , the government seems more and more dysfunctional .
And all we 're doing is depending on them to step up and govern . "
Smith went on to explain the legislation he is sponsoring , saying , " There 's nothing in this amendment that says we withdraw from the war on terror . "
When Fox host Shepard Smith pressed him on whether there might be a civil war in Iraq that is indistinguishable from the war on terror , the senator denied both points .
" It may become a full - blown civil war , " he acknowledged , " but the point is , it 's not ours , it 's theirs .
It 's not something we can win .
... I 'm just tired of American kids dying for that . "
The following video is from Fox 's Studio B , broadcast on July 10 .
Baraka is an incredible nonverbal film containing images of 24 countries from 6 continents , created by Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson , with music from Michael Stearns and others .
The film has no plot , contains no actors and has no script .
Instead , high quality 70 mm images show some of the best , and worse , parts of nature and human life .
Timelapse is used heavily to show everyday life from a different perspective .
Baraka is often considered a spiritual film .
Baraka is now available on Blu Ray DVD Baraka has finally got a Blu Ray transfer , allowing the film to be seen in the quality that it was intended .
A unique 8 K ultradigital transfer system was developed especially for Baraka to capture it to Blu Ray .
The new release includes 80 minutes of new bonus features .
The disc comes in 100 % recycled material .
Order on Amazon.com for just $ 15.98 , and Amazon.co.uk for just £ 12.98 .
Baraka is an ancient Sufi word , which can be translated as " a blessing , or as the breath , or essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds . "
For many people Baraka is the definitive film in this style .
Breathtaking shots from around the world show the beauty and destruction of nature and humans .
Coupled with an incredible soundtrack including on site recordings of The Monks Of The Dip Tse Chok Ling Monastery .
Baraka is evidence of a huge global project fueled by a personal passion for the world and visual art .
Working on a reported US $ 4 million budget , Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson , with a three - person crew , swept through 24 countries in 14 months to make this stunning film .
One of the very last films shot in the expensive TODD - AO 70 mm format , Ron Fricke developed a computer - controlled camera for the incredible time - lapse shots , including New York 's Park Avenue rush hour traffic and the crowded Tokyo subway platforms .
Some people find the lack of context in Baraka occasionally frustrating , not knowing where a section was filmed , or the meaning of the ritual taking place .
However , the DVD version includes a short behind - the - scenes featurette in which cinematographer Ron Fricke explains that the effect was intentional .
" It 's not where you are that 's important , it 's what 's there . "
The DVD also includes behind the scenes footage , including scenes of the grueling shoot at Ayer 's Rock in Australia , when a plague of flies of Biblical proportions made it impossible to film until they rigged up a vacuum to suck the bugs away from the lens .

Overview
For me Baraka is the pinnacle of these films .
The quality of the cinematography is outstanding .
Shots flip from solitary
Monks to crowded streets from great temples to images of war firing a hundred and one thoughts in your mind that you never complete .
Baraka is not just about what you are seeing ,
It is also about how it is presented .
Shots of monks will make you grab your backpack and head for Asia as soon as the film finishes , but you never make it as the shots of post war Kuwait and the refuse dumps of Calcutta remind you that us humans are far from perfect .
The decision to use the Todd - 70 mm format film could never have been easy .
The extra cost and work is clearly worth it though , it leaves its mark against all of the other films .
Images
Interviews
Here are some great interviews with the film makers .
Taken from the DVD extras .
Visual images include ...
Tibetan monks , Orthodox Jews , Whirling Dervishes , a solar eclipse , Buddhist monks , African tribal rituals , Jerusalem 's Wailing Wall , rain forests , Ayers Rock , Big Sur country , Hawaiian volcanoes , Brazilian slums , time - lapse footage of car and pedestrian traffic , post - Persian Gulf War shots of Kuwait 's burning oil fields , burning - of - the - dead ceremonies on the Ganges , refuse dumps of Calcutta , Auschwitz , Egyptian Pyramids , Angkor Wat , Mount Everest , Tuol Sleng in Cambodia , Indonesian factory workers .
Soundtrack
Baraka has a stunning and varied soundtrack .
Primarily composed by Michael Stearns , but also including contributions from many other artists and performers .
Buy the soundtrack here .
The Book
' Baraka a visual journal ' is a book containing 58 original still photographs taken by Mark Magidson during the journey that created the film .
Buy the book here .
The images vary greatly with content and style , from Black and white to colour , from letter box to full page .
The book contains passages where Magidson describes the film and its meaning .
It also has 36 small shots , with descriptions showing the people and equipment that made the film .
I would strongly recommend the book to anyone who has a passion for the film .
It is very nicely printed on Monadnock Dulcet and bound in Asahi Cloth , produced by St. Anne 's Press .
Samsara - the sequel
Ron Fricke is working on a sequel to Baraka entitled Samsara .

If you know how to change your habits , then even a small effort can create big changes .
I ’ve been using these techniques for years to re-engineer many aspects of my life .
That includes overhauling my diet , exercising regularly , cutting out television , and bulking my e-mail and work routines .
Little changes that , when put on autopilot , can result in an improved quality of life .
Here are some tips to get you started :
One Habit For 30 Days – Steve Pavlina , popularized the 30 Day Trial .
You focus on one change for thirty days .
After that time it has been sufficiently conditioned to become a habit .
I ’ve used this as the basis for most of my habit changes .
It definitely works to sculpt the automatic programs that run in the background of your mind .
Use a Trigger – A trigger is a short ritual you perform before a habit .
If you wanted to wake up earlier this might mean jumping out of bed as soon as you hear the sound of your alarm .
If you wanted to stop smoking this could be snapping your fingers every time you feel the urge for a cigarette .
A trigger helps condition a new pattern more consistently .
Replace Lost Needs –
If you opened up your computer and started removing hardware , what would happen .
Chances are your computer would n’t work .
Similarly , you ca n’t just pull out habits without replacing the needs they fulfill .
Giving up television might mean you need to find a new way to relax , socialize or get information .
One Habit at a Time – A month may seem like a long time to focus on only one change , but I ’ve found trying to change more than a few habits at a time to be reckless .
With just one habit change you can focus on making it really stick .
Multitasking between three or four often means none become habits .
Balance Feedback –
The difference between long - term change and giving up on day 31 is the balance of feedback .
If your change creates more pain in your life than joy , it is going to be hard to stick to .
Do n’t go to the gym if you hate it .
Find diets , exercise , financial plans and work routines that are fun to follow and support you .
“ But ” to Kill Bad Thoughts – A prominent habit - changing therapist once told me a great way to nuke bad thinking .
Anytime you feel yourself thinking negatively about yourself , use the word “ but ” and point out positive aspects .
“ I ’m lousy at this job – but – if I keep at it I can probably improve . ”
Write it Down – Do n’t leave commitments in your brain .
Write them on paper .
This does two things .
First , it creates clarity by defining in specific terms what your change means .
Second , it keeps you committed since it is easy to dismiss a thought , but harder to dismiss a promise printed in front of you .
30 , 90 , 365 – I ’d like to say most habits go through a series of checkpoints in terms of conditioning .
The first is at thirty days .
Here it does n’t require willpower to continue your change , but problems might offset it .
At ninety days any change should be neutral where running the habit is no more difficult than not running it .
At one year it is generally harder not to run the habit than to continue with it .
Be patient and run habits through the three checkpoints to make them stick .
Get Leverage – Give a buddy a hundred bucks with the condition to return it to you only when you ’ve completed thirty days without fail .
Make a public commitment to everyone you know that you ’re going to stick with it .
Offer yourself a reward if you make it a month .
Anything to give yourself that extra push .
Keep it Simple – Your change should involve one or two rules , not a dozen .
Exercising once per day for at least thirty minutes is easier to follow than exercising Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays with yoga the first day and mountain biking the third day , except when it is raining in which case you will do …
Simple rules create habits , complex rules create headaches .
Consistency is Key –
The point of a habit is that it does n’t require thought .
Variety may be the spice of life , but it does n’t create habits .
Make sure your habit is as consistent as possible and is repeated every day for thirty days .
This will ensure a new habit is drilled in , instead of multiple habits loosely conditioned .
Experiment –
You ca n’t know whether a different habit will work until you try it .
Mix around with key habits until you find ones that suit you .
Do n’t try to follow habits because you should , but because you ’ve tested them and they work in your life .
Post Your Change Here – Pick a change you want to work on and post it right here in the comments .
You ’ll get the benefits of writing it down and making a public commitment .
The best time to start is right now .
There is no better way to break bad habits than knowing you have the confidence to do so .
Confidence is the key to a well lived life .

Have you ever run into a situation where you wanted to delete a file , but Windows simply would n’t allow you to do it ?
Personally , these things happen to me all the time , especially when I ’m at a client ’s house trying to get their machine clean of malware .
Have you ever tried deleting a locked file using common windows commands ?
If so , then you ’ll know that this is just not possible .
The main reason behind this is that the explorer .
exe process locks files that are in use , effectively preventing you from deleting them .
Usually , these files should not be touched , but sometimes , situations arise when you really need to erase some troublesome ones .
Fortunately , there are a few easy solutions to delete those files .
Solution # 1 : Kill explorer.exe
Open a command prompt
Navigate to the location where the locked file is
Press CTRL -ALT -DEL , click on “ task manager ” , select the Processes tab
Kill the explorer .exe process via the “ End Process ” button
Go back to the command prompt and delete the file
Bring up the task manager windows again
Select file -> new task
Type explorer.exe in the “ create new task ” field
Press OK .
Solution # 2 : Use The Windows Recovery Console
Just stick your Windows CD in your CD tray , boot on it , and at the “ Welcome to Setup ” screen , press “ R “ .
Once the recovery console has started , navigate to the location of your locked file , and delete it .
Since WRC does not really start the system , the files will not be in use , and you will be able to delete them .
Oh , and for all you Linux geeks out there , yes , we know , doing this via a linux live CD / USB key is also possible .
Solution # 3 : Use unlocker
Unlocker is a very useful freeware that will allow you to unlock any files that are currently in use by Windows .
You ’ll know if this is happening if you are getting any of these messages when trying to delete a file :
Cannot delete file : Access is denied
There has been a sharing violation
The source or destination file may be in use
The file is in use by another program or user
Make sure the disk is not full or write - protected and that the file is not currently in use
Unlocker will make things right again for you .
You ’ll notice that right after installing the software , a new option named “ unlocker ” will appear when right clicking any files or folders in Windows Explorer .
To unlock a locked file , just right click it , select unlocker , and the unlocker software will start .
Then , click “ unlock all ” and close the software .
Now that your file is unlocked , just delete it in Windows Explorer , as you always do .
This is much simpler than solution # 1 or # 2 , is n’t it ?
I hope these three solutions will help you get rid of those hard to delete files !
So all of Washington ( and maybe even a few of those out in the rest of the country ) is waiting for Gen.
David Petraeus to deliver his report on the " surge " and how things are going in Iraq .
It is a curious phenomenon whose curiosity has been too little noticed .
We supposedly have a long tradition in this country of civilian control of the military , symbolized by a civilian , the president , being designated as commander - in - chief of the military .
But the civilians who instigated and have run this war have lost almost all the credibility they once might have possessed , and are turning to a military figure to pull their credibility chestnuts out of the fire .
The most interesting  and potentially disturbing  factor is that we will be relying on a military figure to advise us not just on military tactics in the field , on the implementation of a grand strategy devised by civilians , but on the grand strategy itself .
I know , I know .
Despite his repeated protestations that he is relying on his military commanders in the field to give him unvarnished advice that he will not only follow to the letter but honor by providing them all the resources they say they need , President Bush has routinely ignored military advice and fired commanders when they offered advice he didnt want to hear .
Gen .
Petraeus is now the main commander in Iraq , in fact , because the president became disillusioned with the previous commander and shuffled somebody in to carry out a strategy most of the military in the field had little confidence in .
ERODING CIVILIAN SUPREMACY ?
However , perhaps , things are a little different now .
As Bruce Ackerman put it recently in the Financial Times , " he [ the president ] has made himself a hostage .
He needs the general more than the general needs him . "
It is quite possible that even the bubbled president recognizes that nobody believes him anymore .
Even he is talking about a token drawdown of troops in Iraq .
If Gen .
Petraeus doesnt restore a little credibility to his lame - duck presidency , to whom can he turn ?
So what we may be seeing , as the civilians , perhaps hoping to escape a measure of responsibility for the outcome of this misbegotten war , is a gradual erosion of civilian control over the military and the emplacement of the military even more directly than it already is , at the center of policy - making .
For the short run , considering the competence of the civilians in question , that might not be viewed as altogether bad .
In the long run , however , it may be yet another reason to be sorry the neocons and Bush and Cheney got us into this mess .
Most indications are that when Gen. Petraeus delivers his report on Monday it will be balanced and nuanced , acknowledging problems and particularly the almost complete lack of political progress on the Iraqi side , but highlighting progress on the U.S. military and security side .
Thus the old saying , “ How you see it depends on where you stand ” is likely to apply , with both withdrawal advocates and “ stay the course ” advocates able to cherry - pick it to find something to support their preference .
Here are a few things to consider :
The “ surge ” will have to end next April for logistical reasons .
Tours of duty have already been extended from 12 months to 15 months and going to 18 months is off the table .
Top military officials are expressing concern about extended deployments weakening the military , hurting recruitment , encouraging people to leave rather than re-up , and degrading the ability to respond to problems elsewhere .
If the “ job ” is n’t “ done ” by April continuing the surge is not an option .
So the question is what comes after the surge .
Will it be a semi- permanent but reduced deployment calculated so that U.S. forces take hardly any casualties , as in Bosnia , where U.S. troops are still deployed 10 years later ?
Given the obvious weaknesses of the semi-fictional Iraqi government in Baghdad , will the U.S. more directly assume responsibility for running every aspect of Iraq ?
ANBAR THE ANOMALY
It is likely that the progress in Anbar province , which seems fairly real , insofar as one can rely on incomplete news reporting and think - tank assessments , is due less to the surge than to local tribal leaders ( Sunnis ) getting upset enough with the foreign - dominated al - Qaida in Iraq to start resisting them actively  combined with U.S. willingness to provide weapons and money to forces that a year ago were resisting U.S. occupation .
Once the surge ends , if we start turning more responsibility over to the Iraqis , will the Shi’ite - dominated central government provide these tribal forces weapons and money and start integrating them into a national rather than sectarian security force ?
The central government will have legitimate concerns about arming Sunni forces with U.S. training who would be potential adversaries in a civil war that could break out in earnest when the U.S. redeploys or draws down troops .
What is their incentive for doing so ?
Is this the way to stability ?
Without Iraqi political reconciliation , U.S. military success means little in the long run , and every report to date  from the National Intelligence Estimate to the GAO report to the report from the commission headed by former Marine commandant Gen.
James Jones reports little if any progress on that front .
Perhaps the outcome will be a de facto division of the country into three ethnic / sectarian regions 
Kurds in the north , Sunnis in the west , Shi’ite in the south and increasingly dominating Baghdad , given that the Shi’ites have pretty much driven all the Sunnis out of western Baghdad , which used to be Sunni - dominated .
Are there any plans for guiding a de facto loose confederation in such a way as to minimize bloodshed and bitterness along the way ?
In short , is there anything resembling a Plan B ?
If it is unlikely that a reasonably stable central Iraqi government can take over responsibility for security by April , what are the alternatives ?
Could U.S. forces help to relocate Sunnis and Shi’ites in areas dominated by their fellow religionists to minimize the likelihood of sectarian bloodletting as the U.S. turns responsibility over to the Iraqis ?
Might U.S. troops be redeployed to the Kurdish north or to the Arab emirates on the Gulf where they would be available to intervene on short notice should a bloodbath begin ?
Or would this be a waste of American blood ?
HOW LONG , OH LORD ?
I do n’t think a bloodbath is necessarily inevitable if the U.S. begins to withdraw .
Those who are predicting it as an argument for maintaining the U.S. presence have been wrong about almost every prediction they have made over the last five years .
Assuming it ’s likely , however , will keeping U.S. troops actively engaged prevent it if they stay another six months ?
Another year ?
Another five years ?
How many American lives are we willing to lose to reduce the chance of an Iraqi bloodbath ?
If it ca n’t be prevented , what ’s the point of staying longer ?
During the " debate " among GOP presidential hopefuls on Wednesday , former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee admonished Rep. Ron Paul to the effect that when we make a mistake , we make it as one nation , and we have to see it through .
Rep .
Paul rightly responded that it is hardly the wisest course to persist in a mistake once we have acknowledged that it was a mistake .
I recognize that there are still Americans who not only dont consider the war of aggression a mistake , but view it still as the only course of action available and a wise one at that , but their number is dwindling .
And as much as they may speak of the importance of sticking it out until we attain victory , I havent heard one of them explain in intelligible terms  the kind that might guide a coherent grand strategy  just what would constitute victory .
Even the vaguely defined goalposts keep shifting  from tossing out Saddam to finding those pesky WMD to establishing a viable democracy to ( at the beginning of this year ) having the central Iraqi government meet certain benchmarks to ( perhaps now ) hoping that a bottom - up process with Anbar as a model will eventually lead to a viable decentralized Iraqi state .
But none of those goals are the kind that can inform the military just what it has to do to achieve them .
Sooner or later  preferably sooner  we Americans are going to have to acknowledge that invading Iraq was a strategic mistake and begin leaving , acknowledging that we cant establish heaven on earth in a country we never took the trouble to try to understand halfway around the world .
It might be justifiable to take modest steps to try to limit the damage as we leave , but leaving is the most prudent course .
Whether we will learn enough to hew to a more modest foreign policy of war avoidance and independence in the future  leading by example rather than by bombing  will be the next question .
His heart stopped and he needed defibrillation from ambulance officers .
Now facing six weeks off work , he said warning labels on the products should be revamped to alert people that excessive consumption could lead to death .
Labels currently warn against consuming more than two cans , or 1.5 bottles a day , without describing the consequences .
" They say [ on energy drink labels ] do n't have more than this much , " Mr Penbross said .
" But they do n't say if you have too much , what will happen . "
Dr Malcolm Barlow , a cardiologist who treated Mr Penbross at Newcastle 's John Hunter Hospital , said it appeared excessive consumption of energy drinks had precipitated the heart attack .
He said Mr Penbross had no other risk factors apart from smoking and had told him he previously experienced chest pain at times when his intake of the drinks was high .
NSW
Health has urged people to be extremely cautious of overdosing on stimulant products .
Department spokesman Dr Robert Batey said consuming high levels of stimulants had the potential to cause heart attacks .
" It will raise blood pressure and pulse rate and both of those things put a significant demand on the heart . "
Mr Penbross , a concreter , regularly had four Red Bull drinks a day .
" With the work I do I do n't have a lot of time to eat , " he said .
" I have a couple of Red Bulls in the morning and it carries me through . "
Last Sunday he was competing in a motocross event near Port Macquarie when he consumed eight Red Bulls over five hours .
" It was to get a bit of a buzz and keep down my reaction time , " he said .
" You have got to get off [ the mark ] and around the first corner first . "
After his event , Mr Penbross , from Bonny Hills , noticed his heart racing .
He collapsed soon after He was taken to Port Macquarie Hospital before being flown to Newcastle .
There is no history of heart disease in the family and Mr Penbross is in peak physical condition .
Mr Penbross said he had sworn off Red Bull .
A spokeswoman for Red Bull said she was unable to comment on Mr Penbross 's case , but that the product label was clear in advising against excessive consumption .
She said labelling requirements for energy drinks were set by the Federal Government .
IN THE CAN Red Bull contains : carbonated water , sucrose , glucose , acid ( sodium citrates ) , taurine ( 0.4 pc ) , glucuronolactone , caffeine ( 0.03 pc ) , inositol , vitamins ( niacinamide ) , pantothenic acid ( B6 , B12 ) , flavours , colours ( caramel , riboflavin ) .
Each can contains 80 milligrams of caffeine .
The five pictures are by Victorian artist Louis Wain who painted cats through the whole of his life and continued through periods of intense psychosis .
Almost every article on Wain uses them to demonstrate the progression of schizophrenia but the evidence for them being painted in chronological order is actually quite weak .
The five pictures are from an original series of eight which were collected by Dr Walter Maclay who was interested in the effect of mental illness on art .
However , the pictures were undated and , as Rodney Dale notes in his biography of Wain ( Louis Wain : The Man Who Painted Cats ; ISBN 1854790986 ) , “ with no evidence of the order of their progression , Maclay arranged them in a sequence which clearly demonstrated , he thought , the progressive deterioration of the artist ’s mental abilities . ”
In fact , his later works are for the most part conventional cat pictures in his normal style , with the occasional ‘ psychedelic ’ example produced at the same time – where he experimented with what he called ‘ wallpaper patterns ’ .
However , the increasing abstraction over time is likely to be a myth .
Wain ’s biography again :
Assembling what little factual knowledge we have on Dr Maclay ’s paintings , there is clear no justification for regarding them as more than samples of Louis Wain ’s art at different times .
Wain experimented with patterns and cats , and even quite late in life was still producing conventional cat pictures , perhaps 10 years after his [ supposedly ] ‘ later ’ productions which are patterns rather than cats .
All of which is to say no more than that the eight paintings were done at different times , which could be said of eight paintings by any artist !

What better way to start off the day after World Oceans Day than with the world premiere of the underwater video for a previously unreleased Paul McCartney song ?
The song , written in the 1980s , is called Blue Sway , and that ’s exactly the feeling in the imagery created by noted surf filmmaker Jack McCoy .
Using a speedy underwater jet ski , McCoy rides behind a wave .
His camera can tilt up and down and spin 360 degrees around .
The video will be included on a bonus DVD accompanying the reissued album McCartney II — due out June 14 — and will also be shown at the Maui Film Festival on June 19 .
McCoy ’s new feature film A Deeper Shade of Blue , the source of footage for the Blue Sway video , opens the festival on June 15 . - Marc Silver

As a musician , Moby needs no introduction : millions of albums sold , songs in films and commercials , and those black , chunky glasses .
But on the occasion of his ninth studio album , he ’s coming out as a photographer too .
Destroyed , a book of photographs that accompanies the album of the same title out this month , takes us on tour with the eclectic star across places , spaces , and continents .
The images are spare , stark , and vibrant , set in airports , airplanes , hotels , corridors , and concert arenas .
The latter , taken from Moby ’s on - stage point of view , are the only ones filled with the presence of others in this gallery that points to the “ strangeness of touring . ”
Before a recent talk at National Geographic headquarters , Moby stopped to chat with Pop Omnivore .
He ’s taken pictures for 35 years — as long as he ’s been making music — and credits a photographer uncle with introducing him to the craft .
He says he does n’t know which he would choose if he were forced to live without sight or sound , but his musings at the end of a long evening might have offered a clue .
Said the artist : “ I hope to be making music until the day I die . "
You ’ve taken pictures since you were ten .
Do you think audio or visual is a more potent form of expression ?
The methodology of creating music is so very different for me than the methodology behind creating a photograph .
Photography ’s really quick ; it ’s spontaneous and immediate .
For me , taking pictures is documenting , and making music is a long , creative process .
From start to finish a song can take me a year , two years , and there are so many different components to it .
I ’m always working on every last little aspect of it .
What subjects intrigue you as a photographer ?
I love what empty spaces say about people .
My favorite thing to take pictures of : completely neutral , empty spaces .
I ’m so much more interested in an empty chair than in a chair with a person sitting in it .
Aesthetically I like the simplicity and purity , like just simple angles .
But it ’s almost like aesthetic forensics where you take a picture of an empty space .
On the one hand there ’s a simple beauty to it , but it ’s also trying to understand us as a species through the things we ’ve created .
Your book , Destroyed , takes us on tour with you , to cities around the world , through empty spaces and airports and concert venues .
It made me wonder :
Where do you feel most at home ?
British Airways international business class has an upper deck that ’s my favorite place on the planet .
I ’m not trying to be a shill for British Airways but they have these flat beds that are sort of private .
They have five windows and flying from London to Los Angeles — I ’m pretty happy up there .
Because you look out the window & it ’s just this beautiful simple skyscape for 11 hours .
For better or worse that ’s where I feel most at home .
If you had to live without sight or sound , which one would you choose ?
Wow , it ’s the single hardest question I ’ve been asked , and I do n’t know .
I truly do n’t know .
Maybe we can relate it back to the first question about different modes of expression .
Is there a way to describe the relationship between music and photography ?
Music is ineffable .
Music has no form whatsoever — all it is is air moving just a little bit differently .
It ’s the only art form that you ca n’t touch .
You can touch a CD , an iPod , but music technically does n’t exist .
Once it hits your ear , you have a reaction to it , and it ’s gone .
Sometimes we think that ’s a song about trucks , or forests , or that ’s a song about a girl named Jenny , but it ’s still just air moving a little bit differently .
And photography — most visual arts are much more formal , etymologically in the true sense of the word , like pertaining to a specific form .
It ’s almost like left brain / right brain .
But when they work together , especially film and music , boy it ’s just perfect .

I have been assigned the task of researching and compiling our forthcoming map of Cuba .
During the early stages of my research , I hit the cartographic jackpot — the possibility of two new provinces forming in 2011 .
Not only were we going to be publishing a map of Cuba for the first time since 1906 , we were also going to be among the first to showcase its new administrative structure .
This is considered an exciting event for cartographers here at the National Geographic .
Why ?
Because before any element is mapped , we need to assure that it portrays the most up - to - date information .
My first stop was Cuba ’s official government website .
Unfortunately , it was a bit difficult to navigate , especially since the English version of the site was “ under construction . ”
My next stop was the Cuban Embassy — well , not exactly since Cuba and the U.S. have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1961 .
But there is the Cuban Interests Section embedded within the Embassy of Switzerland here in Washington .
It was there that I was able to obtain the official document ( Gaceta Oficial de la Republica de Cuba , No. 023 ) spelling out the upcoming changes to Cuba ’s new administrative divisions — Artemisa and Mayabeque provinces .
As Cuba is organized administratively by province and municipality , we were able to delineate the new provincial boundaries pretty easily by using a map of municipalities contained in the most recent Nuevo Atlas Nacional de Cuba .
In the latter stages of my research I was able to reconfirm the delineation of these boundaries with the Cuban statistics office , La Oficina Nacional de Estadísticas , as they were now providing statistics for these two new provinces .
Now I have to keep abreast of the deepwater oil exploration off the northern coast of Cuba .
If possible , we would like our map to also showcase the location of such prospective oil fields .

Werner Herzog is back .
For his 60th (! ) film , the wild man of cinema took his ever - questing lens into Chauvet - Pont - d ’ Arc Cave , a limestone grotto in southern France filled with animal bones , geological phantasmagoria , and — most important — a gallery of Paleolithic paintings from more than 30,000 years ago .
Far older than those in Lascaux , they ’re remarkable for their detail , sophistication , and variety .
Since 1994 , when the site was discovered , the French government has kept it closed to protect its fragile ecosystem .
But last year Herzog and a tiny crew were permitted a few days in the cave , and a chance to meet the scientists studying it .
The result is Cave of Forgotten Dreams , a metaphysical , three - dimensional trip back in time .
Pop Omnivore spoke with the German auteur about radiocarbon dating , shooting in 3D for the first time , and what a cow - milker ’s face looks like , among other things .
There will soon be seven billion humans on Earth , but how does that number compare to other species on the planet ?
We are certainly outnumbered by ants .
Harvard biologist and ant expert Edward O. Wilson has estimated that there are a thousand trillion to ten thousand trillion ants at any one time . *
That would be about a million ants for every one of us .
And does n’t it seem like that when they invade our kitchens ?
Estimating animal populations , especially wild ones , is hard , but here ’s a look at one category of animals we can count : the ones we eat .

* And they ’re edible .
Ants are a good source of protein and are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world .

Here at National Geographic , fans of CBS ’s The Amazing Race ( and there are many of us ) spend Mondays critiquing the cast and admiring how the show takes us around the globe for up - close glimpses of local culture ( and crazy cab drivers ) .
So I jumped at the opportunity to interview Phil Keoghan , the charming and wry host , as the show wraps up another season this Sunday night .
A native of New Zealand , he shared views on the lessons that his show teaches , the national character of his homeland , and the art of the eyebrow raise .

The " War on Terror " is inextricably linked to place .
Among these are Afghanistan , Kenya , Tanzania , New York City 's " Ground Zero , " and most recently , Abbottabad , Pakistan .
The suffix found on some of these names , such as stan in Afghanistan that means " land of the Afghans , " serves to qualify their cultural or historic affiliations .

The critical habitat established to protect Alaska ’s polar bears is the largest of its kind in the United States .
For the first time polar bears in the U.S. have their own critical habitat .
The 187,157 - square - mile swath around Alaska is mostly offshore , where roughly 3,500 Ursus maritimus dwell on sea ice — and large oil deposits may lurk .
Set last fall , the Interior Department designation means all future drilling plans will be federally scrutinized ( existing structures are exempt ) .
It also protects barrier islands and the coastline where more mother bears are denning as sea ice melts .

So far , reactions have been mixed .
The state of Alaska and Alaska Native corporations , which rely heavily on oil and gas dollars , say the red tape and the habitat ’s vast size will spell huge revenue losses .
Environmentalists cheer the move but fear it wo n’t be enforced .
To save polar bears , they say , list them as endangered , not threatened .
That would bolster legal protections and leave more room to tackle the chief threat to the animals ’ territory : the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change .

There ’s nothing quite like seeing a familiar name on a street sign that brings a smile to your face or perhaps puts you at ease in a new place .
I know that when I first moved to Washington D.C. , I drove past streets named after Rosemary ( my first name ) and Rhode Island ( my home state ) , and I took it as a very good omen .
It turns out that my friend Alison can even one - up me ; she came upon roads named Allison , Arkansas , and Kenyon ( her name , home state , and alma mater , respectively ) on her arrival into the city .
Being in the nation ’s capital will give most people the chance to see his or her home state on a street sign , but what about something as unique as your first name ?
Well , if you want to know just where your name might be found , you no longer have to keep your eyes glued to street signs .

April 22nd is Earth Day .
Mark the day by learning what happens to your e-waste , possibly despite your best efforts .
You have generated e- waste if you 've ever discarded a computer , monitor , cell phone , or television .
Chris Carroll reported in the 2008 National Geographic article , High - Tech Trash , that " in the United States it is estimated that more than 70 % of discarded computers and monitors , and well over 80 % of TVs , eventually end up in landfills ... "
Maybe you are taking your e-waste to an appropriate recycling center and assuming it will be disposed of properly .
It may be , but then again , the recycler may be selling it to the developing world for the conductive components and precious metals .

From left : Aptenodytes forsteri ( Emperor penguin ) , Inkayacu paracasensis , and Eudyptula minor ( Little penguin ) Nothing is black - and - white , it seems .
Not even penguins .
That ’s what University of Texas paleontologist Julia Clarke found after unearthing 36 - million - year - old remains in Peru ’s Paracas National Reserve — the first penguin fossil ever found with evidence of feathers intact .
Like its present - day relatives , Inkayacu paracasensis was a deft swimmer .
Unlike them , it weighed more than a hundred pounds and sported a coat with ruddy feathers .
Clarke ’s team deduced the color last year after comparing tiny pigment packages called melanosomes from the fossilized plumage with those of living species .
This part of coastal Peru has recently produced other big penguin finds .
Clarke says the area could be key to painting the full picture of the birds ’ evolution .
For now , a touch of color has been applied .

New and Complete Map of Cuba , supplement to National Geographic magazine , October 1906 ; NG Maps .
Since our first post , this blog has addressed the history of cartography at National Geographic , geographic names ( toponyms ) , and even the cartographic exploits of James Abbott McNeill Whistler , the American artist best known for the painting " Whistler 's Mother . "
I hope that these topics have proven of interest to some if not all of you .
But what we have not addressed is the personal more intimate side of cartography here at the Society .
Unquestionably , National Geographic is the place to be if you love the science as well as the art of mapmaking .
Our production schedules are full of stimulating and challenging projects that often test our knowledge of the cartographic profession .
Once in a while , we will be assigned a project so close and near to our hearts that it becomes an overriding passion .
Several months ago , I was given such an assignment — a large format ( 36 " x 24 " ) political map of Cuba .

EVER since “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” Al Gore has been the darling of environmentalists , but that movie hardly endeared him to the animal rights folks .
According to them , the most inconvenient truth of all is that raising animals for meat contributes more to global warming than all the sport utility vehicles combined .
The biggest animal rights groups do not always overlap in their missions , but now they have coalesced around a message that eating meat is worse for the environment than driving .
They and smaller groups have started advertising campaigns that try to equate vegetarianism with curbing greenhouse gases .
Some backlash against this position is inevitable , the groups acknowledge , but they do have scientific ammunition .
In late November , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization issued a report stating that the livestock business generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined .
When that report came out , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and other groups expected their environmental counterparts to immediately hop on the “ Go Veggie ! ” bandwagon , but that did not happen .
“ Environmentalists are still pointing their fingers at Hummers and S.U.V. ’s when they should be pointing at the dinner plate , ” said Matt A. Prescott , manager of vegan campaigns for PETA .
Ms Volpes ( R ) has known her new husband all of his life
Wedding video
The groom , Reinaldo Waveqche , told reporters after the ceremony in Santa Fe , northern Argentina : " I 've always liked mature ladies . "
Mr Waveqche added : " I do n't care what other people say . "
He and bride Adelfa Volpes , 82 , are planning to travel to Rio de Janeiro for their honeymoon .
Asked if the marriage was purely spiritual , Ms Volpes laughed and replied : " There is going to be more . "
The couple were married in a civil service after several years of engagement , and later walked through a local church surrounded by reporters .
Their love blossomed when Mr Waveqche went to live with her after his mother 's death when he was 15 .
He said he admired his new wife 's zest for life , and emphasised how special she was to him .

Dear Phytophthora Mold Growing in My Shower Stall , ( Actually , while the Phytophthora may technically be your correct name , may I just call you " Mold " ?
After all , you 've seen me naked . )
Mold , we have been living together now for quite some time and I think its fair to say that we have had a stable , but adversarial relationship .
I kill you , you grow back .
I kill you again , you grow back again .
I kill you yet again , you grow back , and so on .
For the most part things have proceeded along these lines quite nicely .
I do n't spend too much time killing you and you do n't grow back too quickly .
We had reached a state of equilibrium .
Oh sure , my methods of getting rid of you have varied over the years , I remember the early days when the weapon of choice was Windex and paper towels , which as you know is the traditional male method for dealing with any and all cleaning jobs ranging from spilled soda to cleaning - up a major crime scene involving disembowelment and ritual sacrifice .
I used to believe that if you can't clean it with Windex and paper towels then you 're just not using enough Windex and paper towels .
If a particular stain proved especially difficult I 'd use name - brand Windex and not the store brand .
That just how I was raised , God Bless America .
And for the most part things progressed along these lines quite nicely , and by that I mean the shower stall got clean enough to keep Mrs. Soap Box happy and I did n't feel the need to take a shower when I was taking my shower , if you know what I mean .
Now Mold , I have always understood your need and desire to grow and exist , and I 'm pretty sure you 're aware that I will do whatever I need to do you kill you so long as it does not require any real effort on my part whatsoever .
I 'm dedicated , but lazy .
But lately something has changed , YOU have changed .
Whereas before you would retreat in horror and disappear after one of my cleaning attacks , lately it seems you have grown stronger .
You have found the strength to gain a foot - hold at the bottom left corner of the shower stall .
I 've scrubbed and scrubbed , but yet you remain .
Perhaps my friend , you have grown weary of our battle and are putting all your efforts into one last fight for shower stall superiority .
Or perhaps you sense some weakness on my part and feel the time is right to lead an all - out frontal assault and chase me to the spare bathroom where the water pressure is less than adequate .
But either way , only a fool could n't see that your strategy to seize the bottom left corner of my shower stall is working .
I must also admit that you have forced me to go deeper into my arsenal of weapons - deeper that I ever feared would be necessary .
Beyond what even Windex and paper towels can accomplish .
First , I started off by looking at you while I showered and thinking " Got to do something about that mold at some point . "
This , like all peaceful means failed miserably .
Next , I brought out the big boy , the big gun , the peace maker .
Name - brand Windex and Brawny paper towels .
I sprayed and wiped , wiped and sprayed , sprayed and wiped .
This battle went on for literally seconds , yet you remained .
Possessing a short attention span and strong desire to be doing something else , I declared " mission accomplished " and watched a 3 hour marathon of " Ghost Hunters " on the Sci -Fi channel .
I spent the next 2 weeks listening to Mrs. Soap
Box saying things like " The mold is back in the shower " .
Now since I already knew that the mold had returned I found her repeated statement of the obvious to be somewhat perplexing .
Only later did I learn that I was supposed to interpret this as a request to return to battle .
Who knew ?
I was always taught that questions ended with your voice going up at the end and included the word " please " , as in " Would you please stop watching " Ghost Hunters " and clean the shower ?
" So back to the front !
Seeing as how my name - brand Windex solution had proved ineffective , I was forced to improvise and decided to try Oven - Off .
If it can remove old baked on macaroni and cheese which has dried to the consistency of cement , then how can it fail to get rid of YOU Mr. Mold ?
Well , while the tile shined like never before , it appears that Oven - Off too has failed , since you remain firmly entrenched in the grout .
Now I sense that you grow stronger with each of my failed efforts .
In fact , I 'm pretty sure I heard you laughing at me while I showered .
Not the first time I have been laughed at in the shower , but still , it hurt .
And then an idea pops into my head !
Windex contains ammonia , and I know that a lot of other cleaning products contain ammonia , so ammonia MUST be a great cleaner .
But the stuff you get at the store is probably watered down , little - girl ammonia like the kind they use to make the " special sauce " at certain national burger places .
No , I need full - strength ammonia from a reliable production source who is n't out to make a quick buck by selling the cheap stuff to an unsuspecting public .
Then it hit me !
Urine !
Urine contains ammonia !
And while I 've never been tested , I 'm pretty sure that my ammonia production is A - 1 , prime stuff - PURE !
All I have to do is pee on the mold for a week or so with my home - made “ super ammonia ” and nature will work its magic .
Good bye mold !
At least that was the theory .
You see , Mrs. Soap
Box decided that my idea was " gross " and that peeing on the shower wall does not constitute " cleaning " and would not in fact lead to a cleaner shower .
I said , " But look at the toilets .
They 're always clean and I pee in there all the time ! "
Mrs. Soap
Box then gently reminded me that cleaning toilets was her job and that 's why they 're clean .
Now while I was mentally wrestling with whether or not to inform Mrs. Soap Box that I had in fact – although unwittingly – been covertly participating in “ Operation Urine ” with regard to the shower floor each morning and that we would merely be changing our trajectory , Mr. Soap Box made it quite clear that " Operation Urine " was scrubbed for a more conventional strategy .
This is getting like the Korean War , everyone back home wants me to win , but wo n't let me do what is necessary to achieve victory .
Now while the “ official ” answer was " I do n't want you pissing on the shower wall and telling me that you 've done your part to clean the bathroom " I think the real answer is that she was just jealous .
Jealous that if " Operation Urine " worked , she would n't be able to keep her things as clean as I could keep my things clean because she lacks aim .
Not her fault , but unless the stain is on the floor directly beneath her and no one is looking and there is no noise and the faucet is running , and I swear to God that I ’m not peeking ( although I am ) then she has no hope of getting her homemade ammonia to where its needed – while she has the weapon , she lacks a reliable delivery system .
I also think she was afraid that my things would be home - made ammonia - clean and that her things would get grimier by the day while she pathetically peed all over herself in an attempt to clean her half of the house .
I would be the hero , the guy they call in when something needs to be peed on and cleaned .
I would get all the glory and she would have to live in my urine soaked shadow .
So for her own selfish reasons she killed " Operation Urine " , she 's spiteful like that .
OK since " Operation Urine " was off the table , I was down to the bottom of the barrel , I had to take desperate action .
There was no doubt about it , I would have to do the one thing I have always avoided .
I 'm going to have to use elbow - grease .
Yup , going to actually scrub .
You 've pissed me off now Mold , this is now requiring EFFORT !
So I moved up a notch on the guy cleaning ladder and got myself an SOS pad .
Hard steel wool and powdery blue stuff - this is the kind of cleaning grandma used to do !
So I start scrubbing with the SOS pad but from the start its clear that the mission is doomed .
Now in addition to mold , my grout is blue from the SOS pad and the tile looks sort of scratched .
" Operation Urine " would never have ended in disgrace like this !!
So I decide " Screw it , I 'm going nuclear . "
I going to get ALL the cleaning fluids in the house , Windex , Oven - Off , Tile X , bleach - all of them - and hit you with everything I got all at once .
I pour it all on and I scrub , and I scrub - I scrub like the wind !
Of course , the doctor said that the fumes from all those chemicals mixed together is what probably caused me to pass out hit my head on the toilet and lose control of various bodily functions .
Now I do n't want to go into too much detail about the loss of bodily functions , but lets just say that had " Operation Urine " not been scrubbed by the brass back at headquarters , it would have been a complete success , for when those blue jeans came out of the washing machine the next day they were like new !
So I stand here before you now a defeated man looking over the battle field where his hopes were dashed and I can see that you have won .
Mold , you remain firmly entrenched in the lower left corner of my shower stall .
I am beaten and my only viable option is to try and make the best deal possible , so in my own Neville Chamberline - like way I offer to give you the bottom left of the shower stall permanently and in exchange I wo n't regrout the shower in any further attempt to kill you .
You may occupy the space up and including to the 4th tile from the floor and up to and including the 3rd tile in from the corner .
That space is yours now , you may rest easy on your side of the border .
The war is over .
I ’m not sure how I ’ll sell this back home , how to make Mrs. Soap Box understand that appeasement is our only option .
I ’ll probably do what I always do , tell her I need a special tool and that I ’ll get to it “ tomorrow ” .
Side note – this can often be an effective strategy as witnessed by those rolls of wallpaper I was supposed to hang several years ago .
“ Need a special wallpaper tool honey , I ’ll get it tomorrow !
” You know Mold , now that the battle is over , I can see you and I are not so different after all .
Neither of us gains energy through photosynthesis , and we both enjoy warm , dark , moist places .
So live in peace my slimy friend , and in the future , if I happen to pee on you , take no offense , my aim in the morning is n't that great .
Yours truly , Soap Box
John Stossel , who very well may be the best advocate for free markets since Adam Smith , has a great column at RealClearPolitics explaining just why the free market may be the greatest invention in human history :
How many times have you paid $ 1 for a cup of coffee and after the clerk said , “ thank you , ” you responded , “ thank you “ ?
There ’s a wealth of economics wisdom in the weird double thank - you moment .
Why does it happen ?
Because you want the coffee more than the buck , and the store wants the buck more than the coffee .
Both of you win .
Economists have long understood that two people trade because each wants what the other has more than what he already has .
In their respective eyes , the things traded are unequal in value .
But this means each comes out ahead , having given up something he wants less for something he wants more .
It ’s just not true that one gains and the other loses .
If that were the case , the loser would n’t have traded .
It ’s win -win , or as economists would say , positive - sum .
We experience this every time we have that double thank - you moment in a store or restaurant .
And the reason we experience moments like that is because of the simple fact that in a free market each side benefits from a transaction .
You have something I want .
I offer you a price and , after a little negotiation , you accept .
And you give that something to me .
I do n’t force you to buy what I ’m selling .
And you do n’t use some outside authority ( the government ) to dictate to me the terms on which I have to sell it to you .
It ’s worked for hundreds of years and , outside of the regulatory state , it works the same way on an everyday basis .
If you happen to be lucky enough to live in an area where farmer ’s markets are a common occurrence , you know what I mean .
The posted price for produce is just the starting point most of the time .
Depending on the time of day and the season , you can usually negotiate a much better deal .
And that ’s what the free market is all about .
Yes , it does n’t work like a farmer ’s market all the time .
You ca n’t go into Crate & Barrel or Pottery Barn and negotiate the price of a high - end piece of furniture , but , then again , you do n’t have to buy your furniture at a high - end store to begin with .
What matters is that you have a choice .

Sassy is a portable assembler for 32 - bit or " protected - mode " programming on the x86 architecture .
Sassy is based on Henry Baker 's COMFY - 65 compiler , which he wrote in PDP - 10 Maclisp , subsequently ported to GNU Emacs Elisp , and which targeted the MOS 6502 processor .
One of the primary selling points of COMFY - 65 ( besides its small size and the fact that it employed a syntax based on s- expressions ) was its " comfortable set of control primitives " , such as seq , while , and if .
When the assembly programmer / compiler writer used the structure inherent in these constructs , they did n't have to code up a nest of obscure local labels in order to control the flow of computation .
By taking advantage of Lisp 's recursive nature , COMFY - 65 managed this in one pass .
Sassy works the same way .
Its syntax consists of s-expressions and it features the same set of control primitives , and is a ( mostly ) one - pass assembler written in about 3,000 lines of Scheme .
At the same time , Sassy is similar to traditional assemblers for the x86 , with directives for separate heap , data , and text sections , the ability to annotate linker - specific relocation types , and support for labels ( something COMFY - 65 lacked ; Baker recommended using jump - tables .
Sassy uses back - patching ) .
Sassy has a simple macro system , or programmers may write " escapes " to Scheme in order to take advantage of Scheme 's meta- programming facilities .
Sassy is a complete 32 - bit assembler for the x86 line and recognizes the full 32 - bit instruction set , up to and including the SSE3 extensions .
Sassy is also target - and linker - neutral .
Sassy generates a record of objects and information , representing , for instance , the text section , or the alignment requirements of the data section .
The programmer may pass the record to an output module that in turn creates the final output suitable for linking or loading .
Sassy comes with an output module that creates ELF object files for GNU / Linux with dynamic shared library support , or programmers may use Sassy 's API to create their own output modules .

Condoleezza , please just SHUT UP !
According to the media , last Wednesday the 17th , you “ failed ” in your meeting with President Abbas and his “ negotiator ” team in Ramallah , the treasonous puppets who are generally known as the “ garbage of Oslo ” .
First of all , there is nothing to “ negotiate ” about , second , Abbas has neither a mandate nor the legitimacy to “ negotiate ” about anything .
The situation is very clear : when a thief enters your house , you do n’t negotiate , you kick the thief out , call the police , the thief goes to jail , issue finished .
In this example , the thieves are the American and European Jews who interpret their religion in a way which is understood by many other Jews , and by a majority of Christians and Muslims , as a grave heresy .
If for nothing else , the heresy of their interpretation of the Torah rests in that it causes suffering and engenders crime , and as much is stated in the precepts of the religion of your father .
And you wonder about “ difficulties ” while everybody sees that you are supporting and inciting to crimes against humanity ?
What you intend to do to my people and to my country is disgusting beyond belief to read , but the disgust I feel while witnessing your sleazy display of debauchery goes far beyond even what I feel about your criminal intentions .
I feel insulted in my dignity as a woman by your obvious lack of respect for yourself .
Have you no shame to come to my country and insolently threaten us with terrorism from “ Al - Qaeda “ , the American terror organization , and Iran ( I have never seen an Iranian in my country ) , if the traitors who you pay and arm do n’t sign away what does not belong to them ?
Please stop your disgusting show and just shut up !
I tried to understand why anybody in his right mind would embark in a criminal enterprise as abjectly immoral as trying to engage Abbas ( who has all the legitimacy of a sock puppet ) and his gang of crooks in “ negotiations ” to sign away the fundamental rights of all Palestinians , and I read your biography with great interest .
It is even more interesting when one reads that your father was a pastor for one of the currents of Christianity , Presbyterianism , which is accepted by many decent Americans as their religion .
I read that the Presbyterian Church explicitly states in its precepts that the moral law is “ summarily comprehended ” in the 10 commandments handed down by the prophet Moses ( peace and prayers be with him ) .
After reading about you , and comparing what your parents apparently stood for with with your disgustingly criminal acts , it looks like you are heaping ignominy on the memory of your parents .
Knowing that , would it not be prudent for you to shut up lest you expose yourself even more ?
According to your biography , life and your parents , probably good people , gave you every opportunity , in fact , you were privileged far beyond the dreams of most African - American women from your native Alabama , but that did not make a good woman out of you .
Instead , you used your luck to turn away from your people and you sold yourself out to the very groups who still oppress black Americans , and for all your privilege and luck , today you are not more than the water - carrier for “ friends ” who are too cowardly to stand for their own crimes , and who see in you merely an expensive but disposable house - nigger who lends a face to their atrocious crimes against humanity .
For these “ friends “ , who are raping your country and sucking it dry of resources , you go to my country and try to get your illegitimate puppets involved in crimes of such abject immorality that even they resist , and then it is said that you “ had difficulties ” ?
Do your self a favour and shut up lest your special “ friends ” start laughing at your expense openly just like they snigger behind your back as they plan for your demise .
Unlike you , I come from a simple family , and I have never in any way exposed my parents memory to shame .
My grandfather was a farmer who owned land near what is now Haifa .
The squatters from Europe and the USA stole that land from him and kicked him and his family out from his property in 1948 .
My father owned land near what is now Ashqelon .
The Jews stole it from him in 1967 and we were forced to flee to Hebron .
I was forced to flee from Hebron in 2002 under death threats from the IDF .
But , neither my grandfather nor my father ever “ renounced ” to an inch of what was stolen from them by force .
All the might and force of the Jews did nothing to make them “ renounce ” anything .
Neither have I “ renounced ” to my inalienable right to return nor given up my property to my criminal and terrorist neighbors .
The story of my family is the same as that of millions of other Palestinians .
Many of us still have the keys and the ownership documents of what was stolen from us , and nobody has the right to sign away our property and our rights .
Doing so would be deeply immoral , it would dishonour the memory of our parents , and it would legitimize genocide everywhere .
But you , a shameless wretch who dishonours the memory and the religion of her parents with her every breath , you arrive in my country with the strange “ notion ” that , just because you disrespect your parents memory and organize crimes against humanity on an industrial scale , a whole people should insult the memories of their fathers and grandfathers as well , and give in to criminals ?
Would n’t it be prudent that you shut up lest people start thinking in earnest that you are totally crazy ?
You somehow want the Arab leaders to go to Annapolis because your “ friends ” decided that somebody , somehow , had to solve their “ Palestinian problem ” for them , but they do n’t want to be seen committing genocide ( they are seen doing it anyway ) .
That is where you , their highly paid house - nigger , come in : organize a conference where thieves agree to split between themselves what belongs to other people , just like Sikes and Picot and lord Balfour and other psychopaths known from history .
Since you are neither as smart nor as successful as your historic predecessors , you engage in the old “ Al - Qaeda ” scare show : “ if we do n’t solve the Palestinian problem , the whole place will be full of Al - Qaeda ” you are cited by the media .
There is no “ Palestinian problem ” for your information .
The problem lies in the criminality of Israel and the traitors who support Israel in your country , Condoleezza , and that includes you .
Why would a woman who was professor of political sciences at a renowned American university threaten us with acts of terrorism carried out by an organization which is known to be controlled by organizations within the American government ?
We all know who is in truth “ Al - Qaeda “ : the terrorists from the CIA , the Shin Bet , the Jordanian and Egyptian secret services , the foreign thugs working for Abbas and Erekat , and some Palestinian teens captured by the IDF , pumped full of drugs and outfitted with explosives .
Everybody knows as much .
So why do n’t you just shut up , Condoleezza , before more people notice your ignorance and your contempt for even the laws of your own country , which are quite strict about terrorism ?
Putting all together , your special “ friends ” sent you on an errand to legitimize genocide in their name , an errand so immoral that even the most debased bootlickers in the region rejected your “ offers ” and threats , and because of this you “ had difficulties ” but somehow you still want everybody to come to Annapolis .
You disregard international laws and treaties to which your country is signatory , you disregard 60 +
UN resolutions about my country and the Israeli crimes there , you disregard every rest of human decency , you disregard the inalienable rights of all Palestinians and use terrorism and genocide and death squads ( in addition to what the Israelis already do ) to try to twist things in a way favourable to your special “ friends ” , you use your position in government to celebrate and aid and abet and finance and support genocide and terrorism and ethnic cleansing and grand theft , you have the shamelessness to mention the death of your classmate because of racist violence while you give full support to the most racist and criminal regime in the history of humanity , and then you want to tell me that it ’s OK to be expelled from my home and have everything for what I worked stolen and destroyed by your “ friends ” . . .
But you somehow think that you deserve respect and admiration because you own an expensive red dress made by Oscar de la Renta , right ?
Condi , just SHUT UP .
Take with you all the criminally deranged garbage from your country , the ones who are carrying out the genocide against us Palestinians , those American mental cases who indulge every day in crimes and atrocities everywhere in my country .
Take with you the psychos from the FBI and other American criminal organizations who are torturing the many Palestinians unjustly interned in the Israeli Gulag , take with you your envoy for genocide against Palestinians , Keith Dayton , take the poodle and also take with you the corrupt and treasonous bootlickers who you call “ excellent negotiation partners ” , and then shove it , you filth , so that the world may never again hear from you !

Immigrant - rights activists yesterday renewed their push to allow legal noncitizens to vote in the Big Apple .
A bill that would grant permanent residents and other legal immigrants the right to vote in municipal elections has been stalled in the City Council since last year .
“ More than 50,000 adult noncitizen taxpayers in those two districts are disenfranchised by citizenship voting laws , ” said Cheryl Wertz , of New Immigrant Community Empowerment , referring to today ’s special election for council seats in Brooklyn and Staten Island .
Councilman Charles Barron ( D - Brooklyn ) , the sponsor of the Voting Rights Restoration Act , said that years ago , when immigrants were mostly European , they had voting rights .
“ Then when the complexion of immigrants changes , then all of a sudden , the laws change , ” he said .
Ron Hayduk , a CUNY professor , concurred , saying immigrants voted in national elections from 1776 through 1926 .
A keen observation by Digby :
I do n't know if anyone 's noticed , but George W. Bush is being disappeared from the presidential campaign and everyone 's running against incumbent Hillary Clinton .
Subtly , but relentlessly , the public psyche is being prepared to deny Junior ever existed .
And it could work ...
I certainly do n't blame the Republicans for trying to do it .
It makes sense , since their boy is an epic failure and the original Clinton is still very present in people 's minds .
It will be quite a trick to pull off , but I can see the press already helping them do it .
( Naturally . )
It 's an interesting phenomenon and one for which I hope the Democratic strategists are prepared .
Their underlying theme seems to be , " If you want change , vote Republican ! "

I just finished reading The Little Schemer .
What an awesome book !
I love the Q&A format of this book and can't wait to read the next book in the series , The Seasoned Schemer Chapter 9 and 10 ( the last two chapters ) were really good .
Chapter 10 is about writing a small scheme interpreter .
But its Chapter 9 that I want to discuss in this blog post because Chapter 9 introduces the Y Combinator .
I 've tried to understand it in the past and failed ( the wikipedia page is completely unintelligible ) , but this book explains it in a brilliant way .
In fact it derives the Y combinator from the ground up , making sure each step is easy to understand .
As an exercise , I tried to write it in Python .
This is how it came out :
If you do n't know the Y combinator already , that probably looks quite cryptic .
To give a simplified explanation , the Y combinator is a function that takes one function as input and creates a recursive version as an output .
Maybe an example will illustrate the point better :
Take a look this function .
The function name is _ 1 .
The function body has something that looks like a recursive factorial implementation , except that it never calls itself ( remember , the function name is _ 1 ) .
Instead , it recurses on " factorial " which is a parameter of the function _ 1.
Basically , the " factorial " parameter is a function , so the meaning of _1 is : Exploring a bit more :
The above function f is passing error as a parameter to _1 .
So if n is zero , it returns 1 .
Otherwise , it goes to the else part and calls the function that we passed as parameter , in this case error , which raises an exception .
In order for this to be recursive , we do n't want it to call error , we want it to call the same function again .
What if we passed the same function as a parameter ?
So in the else part , instead of calling error , it would call itself .
Something like this Hmm , in each case , the recursion finally stops with an exception when it encounters the error function .
A truly recursive version would be likeWell , that is basically what the Y combinator does .
Using some function passing magic , it converts _1 into the forever recursive version .
How ??
Well thats the magic !!
Its a bit complicated to explain here .
Get the book and read Chapter 9 .
But it works !
Check this out : Amazing is n't it ?
And the even more amazing thing is that it is not specific to factorial .
See this Woohoo !!
On a roll now ..
You can take any recursive function , and rewrite it in the above style and the Y combinator will make a recursive version of it .
How cool is that ?
On January 17 - 19 , the KDE community will present KDE 4.0 with a Release Event at the Google headquarters in Mountain View , California .
The purpose of this event is to celebrate the anticipated release of KDE 's new desktop environment and development platform .
In addition to the KDE community , representatives from businesses , press and other Free Software groups will attend .
We hope this event will help spread the word about KDE 's new release and how it impacts the future of the Free Desktop .
Read further for more information about this event .
Because this event aims both to be informative and productive , we have created an ambitious schedule .
There will be plenty of time and opportunity for interaction between all attendees ; but there will also be many interesting presentations , involving both technical and non-technical topics .
We have invited over 200 members of the media , I.T. business , distributions and other Free Software groups , completed of course with many members from the North - American KDE community .
Further , several international KDE hackers will attend to give talks or help organise the event .
The major keynotes and talks will be available live over the Internet thanks to support from Fluendo .
Due to financial and space constraints we were unable to invite all KDE developers , so we encourage local and regional KDE 4.0 release parties all over the world .
We have tried to ensure the main Keynote by Aaron Seigo , which will of course have a live stream , is scheduled at such a time the international community meetings can see and listen to it .
We hope this event will both strengthen the KDE community in the United States and increase awareness about KDE and what we have to offer .
The KDE community should be proud of both the upcoming KDE 4.0 release and the foundation prepared for the life of the KDE 4 series ; we hope that this release event will introduce and educate those not familiar with KDE , and strengthen relationships with those that are .
Anyone basing any claims of alien existence or an alien crash at Roswell on these documents would be foolish to do so ; they just do n't stand up to cutting edge scientific analysis .
Top secret documents alleged to have been written by high ranking government and military officials , including three U.S. presidents , leaked to the public in the early 1980s , have been proven fraudulent by recent forensic linguistic testing .
These documents , collectively named " The Majestic Documents " by researchers , contained references to the alleged crash of a flying saucer near Roswell , NM , in July of 1947 .
References to extraterrestrial technology and alien bodies appear in several of the documents .
Dates of the documents themselves range from 1942 to the early 1990s .
The Majestic Documents were allegedly authored by members of an above top secret task force ( MJ - 12 ) begun under the auspices of then President Truman to deal with the crash of an extraterrestrial space craft near Roswell .
The cache of documents included memos written by President Truman ; Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter , who would become the first Director of the CIA ; Dr. Vannevar Bush , who chaired the Office of Scientific Research and Development ; and General Nathan Twining , who headed the Air Materiel Command at Wright - Patterson Air Force Base , where the wreckage was taken , and who served as Air Force Chief of Staff ( 1953 - 1957 ) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( 1957 - 1961 ) .
Aside from President Truman , memos allegedly written by presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy are also among the Majestic Documents .
The documents were tested by Dr. Carol Chaski of Georgetown , DE , who was hired by Dr. Michael Heiser , a biblical scholar with an interest in the UFO phenomenon .
Dr. Chaski is a leading expert in the linguistic science of authorship attribution , a discipline that uses computers to extract and define stylistic patterns in a given author 's writings -- a " linguistic fingerprint " .
Dr. Chaski pioneered her own computational document authentication software program , ALIAS , for such testing , and is currently the president of ALIAS Technology , LLC .
Among the stylistic patterns detected by Dr. Chaski 's specially - developed computer program are patterns in sentence structure , word order in parts of speech and use of punctuation .
A total of 17 documents were tested , allegedly written by nine different authors .
Dr. Heiser typed the prose text of the disputed Majestic Documents and a set of undisputed control documents for each author for Dr. Chaski 's testing .
Of the 17 documents tested , only one can be scientifically validated as having been written by the author who is named .
Dr. Heiser 's assessment : " Anyone basing any claims of alien existence or an alien crash at Roswell on these documents would be foolish to do so ; they just do n't stand up to cutting edge scientific analysis . "

Recently named one of the 100 most influential people in ufology by FATE Magazine , Michael S. Heiser , Ph.D. earned an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin - Madison and an M.A. from the University of Pennsylvania .
Dr. Heiser has taught at the college level for more than 12 years , and has had a lifelong interest in UFO , occult and paranormal phenomena .

Via Chicago Tribune :
FT . LEAVENWORTH , Kan .
As high - profile Republicans increasingly join Democrats and civil rights groups in denouncing the U.S. holding of alleged terrorists at Guantanamo Bay , a proposal to move detainees to this historic Army post in the geographic heart of America is gaining widespread political support .
Under the plan , several hundred foreign detainees could be transported from the U.S. detention facility in Cuba , a prison that has evoked worldwide outrage amid allegations of strong - arm interrogation tactics , to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks here , the Department of Defense 's only maximum - security prison on U.S. soil .
The plan has drawn criticism from many residents around Ft. Leavenworth .
The move , supporters say , could quell criticism that the United States is using the isolated Guantanamo prison to hold detainees in substandard conditions and to use torture to obtain information .
And although experts caution the transfer of these prisoners may do little to change the legal rights they are currently afforded , the proposal is reviving debate about how much -- if any -- constitutional protection these prisoners should have while in U.S. custody .

I ’m not going to start off like everyone else , saying that we live a time when anybody needs an e-mail address , because technology is advanced , blah , blah , blah …
If you ’re reading this , you surely have an e-mail address and you know what it ’s all about , so I ’m not going to explain the principles of electronic communication .
Lately , I ’ve seen an explosion of websites that offer e-mail services , just to get some extra visitors , or some recognition , but I myself do n’t even bother checking them out , because I think they ’re all the same .
If you ’re the type of person that likes innovative and diverse things , you might want to read what follows .
Each person should have , in my opinion , at least one of the following six e-mail accounts :
Yahoo !
Mail
Why ?
Because it ’s one of the most widely spread e-mail providers out there , and its services are always expanding .
Cool interface ( which the Yahoo ! Mail Beta has made cooler ) , more than enough space ( 1.0 GB will suffice , if you only deposit e-mails ) , lots and lots of other things you can do with your Yahoo !
Account .
GMail
Why ?
Simple .
Because Yahoo ! and GMail are the largest rivals out there , and they will always compete for your appreciation , by giving you newer , cooler things .
As opposed to Yahoo ’s mail system , GMail has the advantage of controlling several e-mail addresses from the same account , a larger storage space ( almost 3.0 GB ; if that does n’t satisfy you , what will ? ) , and a better interface .
The one slight disadvantage is that you ca n’t register your account directly from the website , you have to be invited by a friend .
But do n’t worry , there ’s bound to be somebody willing to help ( if not , ask me and I ’ll invite you ) .
The world ’s longest Alphabetical Email Address
Why ?
Because it ’s funny as hell .
Even as they advertise it : everybody will think your e-mail account is bogus ; email software cannot be configured ; web forms are unable to read your email address ; people have a hard time even typing your address .
Let ’s be honest , it ’s not meant to be effective , it ’s meant to be funny .
And it is .
What ’s the address , you ask ?
Let me take a deep breath .
Here it goes :
http://www.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz abcdefghijk.com / .
Woah .
10 Minute Mail
Why ?
Because it ’s simple and very very useful !
Did you ever find yourself wanting to register an account somewhere , and that somewhere asked for your e-mail address to confirm something ?
You know you ’re gonna get spammed by doing it , but you do n’t have any choice – you need that account now ; maybe in ten minutes you wo n’t , but you will now .
That ’s where the 10 minute mail comes in handy .
Go there , register an account ( a random one will be provided ) , the confirmation will come , and you wo n’t have any problem registering your account .
After that – the e-mail is just deleted , no questions asked .
If you still need some time , it can be extended by another 10 minutes , and another 10 minutes , and another 10 minutes , for as long as you need .
Goowy
Why ?
Because it ’s the nicest I ’ve seen in a long time .
In fact , it ’s not only an e-mail service .
It ’s your own personal online desktop , filled with games , IM , Email , contacts , File Storage , even mini widgets .
I ’m not going to say any more , hoping that you become curious and check it out yourself .
Trust me – it ’s worth it !
FreeGabMail
Why ?
Because you can easily send videos and audio recordings to all your friends , without having to register an account .
Simple design , simple idea .
Well , that ’s that .
Which one of the above did you like ?
Which account do you already own ?
I must confess that I ’ve got accounts on all of the above , and all impressed me in some way .

Kelly Michaels
The Wee Care case that sentenced Kelly Michaels to prison for 47 years was typical of the child - abuse hysteria that gripped the United States in the 1980s .
At the peak of the frenzy of the great day - care witch hunt , it was the day - care workers , not the preschoolers , who were at risk .
As the preschoolers , urged on by overzealous social workers , child therapists and prosecutors , told their incredible stories of sexual abuse and satanic rituals in courtrooms across the United States , scores of innocent people were sent off to prison .
Some are still there .
by Lona Manning
" The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters "
Kelly Michaels never intended to become a preschool teacher -- she had taken fine arts and drama in college -- but she wanted to live near New York City and was looking for something to pay the rent when she applied at Wee Care Day Care in Maplewood , N.J. Although Kelly doubted if she had the qualifications , the director , Arlene Spector , had been encouraging and had persuaded her to give it a try .
Once hired , Kelly was quickly promoted from teacher 's aide to preschool teacher .
Kelly , then 23 years old , found that the children responded well to her .
She was the oldest child in a large family and she 'd done a lot of babysitting .
Even without special training , Kelly knew what little children liked , what songs and games made them laugh , how to soothe their upsets , and settle their quarrels .
But Kelly grew dissatisfied with Wee Care and complained that the teachers were expected to do too much without enough support and supervision .
She decided to look for another job .
Although she knew that it was upsetting for little children when their teachers -- with whom they 'd formed a bond -- came and went , Kelly accepted a teacher 's job at the Community Day Nursery in East Orange , N.J. , where she shared an apartment with a roommate .
Community Day Nursery was a nicer facility -- larger , lighter , airier -- than Wee Care where the kids were stuck in the basement of a stone church and had to traipse down a long hall and up a flight of stairs to go to the restrooms .
On May 6 , 1985 , as Kelly was getting ready for work , she must have felt that her life was beginning to take shape and direction .
She had fallen into the other day - care job , but this one she had chosen .
Then came the knock on the door of her apartment .
It was just after 7 a.m .
A police sergeant and an investigator , both men , stood in the doorway .
They were looking for Margaret Kelly Michaels .
Could she come down to the prosecutor 's office for questioning ?
Bewildered and concerned , Kelly went to the prosecutor 's office where she was told she was suspected of sexually touching three of the little boys at the Wee Care Day Care .
Kelly was shocked and horrified and as the questioning continued , she began to cry :
" Did you sexually assault Jonathan Moore during naptime or any other time while you were at Wee Care ? " " No . " " Did you ever touch or attempt to touch Sean sexually ? "
" No . " " Did you ever lock any of the pupils in a closet ? "
" No --" " Did you ever touch Paul on his penis with a spoon ? "
" No . " " Are you sexually attracted to any of these pupils that we just talked about ? " " No ! "
The questioning went on for nine hours , and included a lie detector test , which Kelly passed .
She was also repeatedly asked , " Why would the children say that you did these things ? "
It was up to Kelly to prove to her interrogators that she was n't a monster .
Kelly racked her brain trying to think how this could have happened to her .
'' I was a very trusting , naive person , " she described herself later .
" I loved life … I wanted to be an actress , I wanted to be a writer .
I had never been in trouble with the law , not even a parking ticket , Catholic high school , Catholic college , drama club , president of my student council in high school . ''
The whole thing had started , she learned , when one of the little boys that she used to supervise at naptime , Jonathan Moore , was at his doctor 's office .
He was being examined for a rash , but his mother was also worried about his hyperactive behavior , which was another added stress in her life , on top of her troubled marriage .
The nurse was taking his temperature with a rectal thermometer and Jonathan had said that his teacher at day care took his temperature .
He was n't upset or angry or frightened when he mentioned it , and upon further questioning , explained that the teacher was named " Kelly . "
Jonathan added that Kelly also had taken the temperature of two other boys , Sean and Evan ( the names of all the children and parents are not their real names and are the pseudonyms used in Nap Time , a book about the Wee Care case ) .
Jonathan 's grandfather was a prominent local judge .
Soon Jonathan was repeating his allegations to Sara McArdle , an assistant D.A. at the Essex County Prosecutor 's Office .
McArdle , an intense woman in her 30s , would become the lead prosecutor in the case .
McArdle also interviewed the other two boys Jonathan had mentioned at the doctor 's office .
Evan Connors denied that Kelly had inserted anything in his bottom or abused him sexually in any way .
But Sean , described as " agitated , hostile , rushing around the room , almost trapped , " during questioning , came up with a new charge -- he alleged that Kelly Michaels had touched his penis .
The wheels started to turn on what would become one of New Jersey 's longest and most expensive crime trials .
Although the Wee Care parents were initially told only that " serious allegations " had been made against a " former employee , " it was n't long before all the parents knew that Kelly Michaels was the employee in question and the " allegations " became , at least in their minds , an established fact .
Peg Foster of the Child Abuse Diagnostic and Treatment Center at Children 's Hospital of New Jersey , in Newark , met with the parents the week after Kelly was first questioned .
She provided the parents with a list of symptoms that children might be displaying if , in fact , they had been sexually abused .
The list included tummy aches , fear of being separated from parents , and bedwetting .
In addition Foster included a warning to be on the lookout for any sexual behavior or remarks , such as inappropriate sex play or touching .
None of the Wee Care parents had raised any complaints or alarms about Kelly during the seven months that she had cared for their children .
None had mentioned suspected sexual abuse at the day care to the director , or to their doctors , or to the police .
But after the meeting with Foster , the rumors and after - the - fact detection work began to spread like a virus in the Wee Care community .
In retrospect , the parents remembered that many of the children had been refusing to take naps .
Some had mysterious rashes on their bottoms .
Another child had been stuttering .
What about that time a little girl asked a teacher , " Do you want to see my vagina ? "
Parents , especially mothers , spent hours on the phone comparing symptoms and worries -- what if , what if ?
They were alternately reassured and horrified to learn that Lou Fonolleras , an investigator with the Department of Youth and Family Services , would be spending some time at the day care to interview the children .
ENTER THE SOCIAL WORKERS
Sometime in between Jonathan Moore 's first remark that Kelly took his temperature and Kelly 's arrest two months later on charges of multiple child abuse , the prosecution shifted from investigating to see if a crime had been committed , to building a case against Kelly Michaels , the sex pervert .
Nap Time , a book about the case that was based on interviews with the prosecution team , does n't discuss any hard evidence or forensic findings that solidified doubt into certainty for the prosecution team ; it only relates emotions and intuitive flashes .
Peg Foster " was overwhelmed by a kinetic feeling of sudden conviction " when listening to the children 's parents talk about how their kids were n't sleeping well and were refusing certain foods .
Lou Fonolleras and Sara McArdle got that tingling feeling just by walking down the paneled hallways of the church in which the day care was located .
Thus the case against Michaels was driven by emotion , and conducted not with reference to logic or traditional crime detection techniques but in accordance with certain beliefs to which Foster , Fonolleras and McArdle subscribed and which they , in turn , preached to the parents .
One was that young children seldom , if ever , lie about sexual abuse .
Even if some of the details were far - fetched , the basic charge of sexual abuse was true because children as young as 3 or 4 could not even conceive of such a thing on their own , therefore they had to be speaking from experience .
Their rallying cry was , " Believe the Children . "
Another was that if a child denied that anything had happened with his teacher , it was n't because nothing had happened , it was because the child was afraid to tell .
In fact , as Foster told her fellow investigators , " the more silent the child , the worse the abuse the child must have suffered . "
Therefore , it was necessary to question and re-question and question again until the child did tell .
This second point , that if a child said ' no , ' he had to be lying , was in direct contradiction to point one , " Believe the Children . "
Point three explained the discrepancy :
The children were withholding the truth because they were afraid of Kelly .
In addition to tormenting her young charges sexually , Kelly must also have terrorized them with threats for their own and their families ' safety .
Therefore the children had to be reassured that Kelly was a bad person who was now in jail .
When , after repeated urging , a child unlocked the dark secret that had been corroding his soul , it was known as " disclosure . "
Imbedded in this belief system , however , was the classic Catch - 22 : Because " disclosure " meant the child had been abused , and refusal to disclose also meant the child had been abused and threatened to boot , there was no way for a child to demonstrate that he or she had not been abused .
Little Evan Connors is a case in point .
When assistant D.A. McArdle first interviewed him he denied that anything bad had happened with Kelly .
A few weeks later , Lou Fonolleras of the Department of Youth and Family Services came to Wee Care .
Fonolleras interviewed Evan and again Evan denied that anything bad had happened .
Fonolleras , however , had confidence in his ability to intuit when children were hiding the truth .
" You ca n't go by what they say , " he explained .
Fonolleras suggested that Evan 's mother read No More Secrets for Me , a child 's book about sexual abuse , to him at bedtime .
Fonolleras felt that if tales of body parts , touching , and secrets were Evan 's nightly bedtime fare , he might be encouraged to " disclose . "
Soon , Mrs. Connors reported that Evan was misbehaving and acting out in the daytime , and haunted by nightmares at night .
After two weeks of urgings from the grownups in his life , and scary bedtime stories , Evan was ready to " disclose . "
According to his mother , Evan said that his teacher Kelly had sucked his penis and scraped his nipples with a fork .
He named other children as participants .
He was interviewed once again by Fonolleras and this time he added new allegations -- the children had been made to undress and pile on top of one another .
Kelly had inserted forks , knives and spoons in his private parts .
( This interview and the other initial interviews – when the allegations were first made , were not recorded ) .
All the other friends I talked to told me everything that happened .
Randy told me .
Connie told me ... And now it 's your turn to tell .
You do n't want to be left out , do you ?
( The following quotes in italics are taken from excerpts of the transcripts of the interviews held with the Wee Care children .
For more excerpts , click here . )
The children Evan named were questioned in turn and they added yet more names to Fonolleras 's list until practically every child who attended Wee Care was declared to have been a victim and the charges against Kelly Michaels became a mind - boggling catalog of sexual perversity .
Some of the allegations that the young children made -- such as claiming that Kelly forced them to play " duck , duck , goose " in the nude -- were improbable , but at least were physically possible .
Other charges , such as the allegation that she had put cars on top of them and turned one child into a mouse , were not .
The investigators , suspecting that the young children lacked the vocabulary to explain the evils they had been subjected to , taught them the names of body parts with anatomically correct dolls .
Investigator :
What are these things [ pointing to a doll ] ?
What we all have here ?
Breasts or boobies ?
What do you want to call them ?
Child :
You 're teaching me .
Investigator : I 'm not teaching you .
I 'm asking you .
Come on .
Do n't go throwing stuff around like that .
Child : Stop teaching me this stuff .
Investigator : You got to learn somehow .
. . .
The social workers believed that disclosure would bring psychic relief to the children .
That 's why I need your help , especially you older kids ... because you can talk better than the younger kids ... and you will be helping to keep her in jail longer so that she does n't hurt anybody .
Not to mention that you 'll also feel a lot better once you start .
But after talking to the investigators , the children did n't feel a lot better .
They felt a lot worse and most went into therapy .
They were upset , fearful , and started saying and doing sexually inappropriate things .
" Pee on me ! " one child exclaimed to her mother .
Nightmares and stomachaches were common .
Investigator :
And did you have to pee on her at all ?…
Investigator : Well , what about licking the peanut butter ?…
Investigator : Did you ever see Kelly locking any of the kids in the bathroom or closet ?…
The children 's suffering was carefully related in Nap Time , written by Lisa Manshel , a friend of Peg Foster .
Again and again in Nap Time , Manshel records that after " disclosure , " the children 's behavior got worse , not better .
One child started to masturbate openly , and invited her mother to " smell my vagina . "
In every instance , the social workers , the prosecutors ( and Manshel , the author ) , believed that the children were acting up because they had been sexually assaulted and were wounded on a psychic level .
The prosecution was blind to the alternate explanation that the children were traumatized because they had been through a psychologically terrorizing interview process with grownups who would n't take " no " for an answer .
I 'm here to help you , and I know you want to tell me something , and I 'll stay here all day -- till you tell me .
Or the children were acting up because their world no longer made sense .
All of the adults in their lives -- their parents , their remaining teachers , their doctor , and the man with the funny dolls -- were telling them that Kelly had done horrible things to them .
They had liked Kelly and they were mad at her when she went away .
The policeman said she was in jail .
So she must have done something bad .
Some of the children began speaking of a " good " Kelly and a " bad " Kelly , perhaps as a way of separating their memories of their pretty , smiling teacher from the mean person Mr. Fonolleras kept talking about .
" Tears still come out of my eyes sometimes , " Joey Gardner told his mother , " because I feel so bad because Kelly was my best friend . "
Tell me what Kelly did to your hiney and then you can go .
If you tell me what she did to your hiney , we 'll let you go .
Although many of the children expressed affection for Kelly , and distaste for the questioning and the questioners , ( Little Joey referred to McArdle as " Vomit , " and spit at Fonolleras ) the investigators were certain the terrorized tots were really in mortal fear of Kelly .
For example , Jonathan " became inhibited around ( McArdle ) , " but this was not because of his feelings toward the abrasive prosecutor , it was because of his feelings about his teacher : " ( Jonathan ) seemed to react negatively to women as a corollary to his feelings toward Kelly . "
Later analysis of the Fonolleras interviews showed that " 16 of the 34 children never said they were afraid of ( Kelly Michaels ) and the remaining children never volunteered that information . "
Furthermore , the prosecutors were never able to extract from the children 's disjointed and contradictory answers a plausible scenario whereby the young preschool teacher could have kept so many children silent for so long .
Three - and - 4 - year - olds , after all , are at a developmental stage where they are beginning to understand the concept of rules of behavior , and " I 'm telling ! " is their constant refrain , particularly among female children .
But as Manshel records in Nap Time : " the team was certain , even without specifics , that somehow the children had been made to keep silent . "
Investigator : You Wee Care kids seem so scared of her .
Child : I was n't .
I 'm not even .
Investigator :
But while you were there , were you real scared ?
Child : I do n't know Investigator :
What was so frightening about her , what was so scary about her ?
Child : I do n't know .
Why do n't you ask her ?
In the following exchange , the investigators make little bribes and even plead for the child to cooperate
At no time does the child say he is afraid , but the investigator supplies the reassurance that Kelly cannot harm him :
The investigators are blindly pursuing their belief – ignoring , even contradicting what the child does say about his feelings , and interpreting his reluctance as fear .
Child : I hate you .
Investigator : No you do n't ... You just do n't like talking about this , but you do n't hate me .
Child :
Yes , I do hate you .
Investigator :
We can finish this real fast if you just show me real fast what you showed me last time .
Child : No. Investigator : I will let you play my tape recorder .... Come on , do you want to help us out ?
Do you want to help us keep her in jail , huh ?
... Tell me what happened to ( three other children ) .
Tell me what happened to them .
Come on ... I need your help again , buddy .
Come on .
Child : No. Investigator :
You told us everything once before .
Do you want to undress my dolly ?
Investigator ( 2 ) : Let 's get done with this real quick so we could go to Kings to get popsicles ... Did Kelly ever tell you she could get out of jail ?
The investigators believed the children needed more reassurance , which meant more discussions about the bad things Kelly had done to them , and how she was in jail now and could n't hurt them any more .
However , when the counselors told the children that Kelly had used her power over them but that she could n't any more , the preschoolers , operating at the level of concrete thought , could only understand this as a reference to the only kind of powers they knew about – the superpowers of cartoon characters .
Soon , the investigators were reporting that , according to the children , Kelly Michaels claimed she could walk through walls and turn herself into a monster .
This must have been , the prosecution figured , one of the ways in which she terrorized them !
They did n't realize they were hearing their own jargon , distorted by childish misunderstanding , turned back on them .
They were hearing the echo of their own fears and reporting it as child abuse .
During the weeks Fonolleras was questioning the children , the Wee Care parents were actively involved , exchanging allegations and warning each other if one child mentioned another child 's name in connection with the investigation .
Some of the children continued to attend the day care ( it closed permanently a few months after the allegations surfaced ) and the remaining Wee Care teachers heard the children discussing the interviews with each other , and the strange dolls that had private parts on them .
THE SMOKING ( PEANUT - BUTTER ) GUN
Kelly Michaels , stuck in a county jail for six months because her family had trouble raising the $ 25,000 bail , felt as though she had fallen down Alice 's rabbit hole .
She thought that the impossibility of the charges -- their sheer number , variety and inconsistency , would make it obvious to any rational - minded person that the whole thing was a horrible mistake , a fantastic concoction of childish fears and fantasies , abetted by some sick - minded individuals on the prosecution side .
Sneaking off with her entire class to the choir room and playing " Jingle Bells " in the nude ?
Peeing on them ?
Engaging in group orgies with 3 - and - 4 year - olds ?
What child molester would take chances like that when footsteps in the hall meant being caught red-handed , with no time to clean up and dress the children .
Feeding children a cake made of excrement ?
Most of them did n't want to eat their vegetables !
A child forced to drink urine and eat excrement would probably throw up .
How was that even sexual ?
" If you do n't help me , I 'm going to tell your friends that you not only do n't want to help me , but you wo n't help them . "
Kelly 's lawyers suspected that the " counseling " the children received was really just a way to reinforce the false stories of abuse that the investigators had planted .
They asked the court for the right to have their own expert therapist interview the children .
But the defense team was denied any access to the children before the trial .
Some parents , it is true , were at first reluctant or skeptical .
Peg Foster and the other therapists in the case worked at persuading them that it was all too true .
This was referred to as overcoming their " denial . "
Nap
Time also describes how Foster , searching for some physical evidence to back up the wild accusations , finds peanut butter in the day - care kitchen :
" She thought , ' Oh God , it 's really here , I found it ! "
Peg was surprised at herself for not having expected success , stunned , even after all she had heard , to be reminded ( by the jar of peanut butter ) that the sexual activity had actually happened .... "
If a jar of peanut butter , found where one might expect to find peanut butter , could be proof , to a trained professional , of sexual perversion -- then Kelly Michaels was facing a tough time when she came to trial , a year and a half after her arrest .
Just as the investigators left no way for the children to demonstrate that they had not been abused , the prosecution left no way for Kelly Michaels to show that she was innocent .
THE TRIAL
By the time the trial began , Kelly was already well established as a monster in the media .
Her lawyers had advised her to not give interviews .
Unfortunately this strategy meant that anyone could project an image of a molester on the young woman they knew only as a stoic but forlorn figure wearing handcuffs and escorted to the courtroom by a full security detail .
The security was to protect Kelly from the death threats she 'd received , but it also created the impression that she was so dangerous that she might somehow , like an evil genie , escape from her captors and resume her rampage .
Kelly 's family and friends mostly lived in Pennsylvania , while the relatives and friends of the children were close at hand .
In Nap Time , Manshel only mentions Kelly 's immediate family and an uninvited assortment of kooks and convicted sex perverts as sitting on Kelly 's side of the courtroom .
Judge William
Harth agreed to let the child witnesses , 19 of them , testify one after another from the judge 's chambers on closed circuit TV , so that they did n't have to face their alleged abuser in court .
He ruled that the defense could not discuss the children who were not testifying , thus cutting off another avenue of defense .
Kelly and her lawyers could not show that , taken as a whole , the investigation was seriously flawed , and that if some of the allegations were obviously impossible , then all of the allegations were suspect .
Even so , some fantastic tales were aired in the courtroom , such as the charge that Kelly had made a child stick a sword in her bottom , and some of the children appeared confused , answering the same essential question " yes " to the prosecution , " no " to the defense , and " yes " again to the prosecution on re-direct .
Some of the parents , alternating between simmering hatred for Michaels and grief for their children , testified that their little ones were frightened about going to day care , crying and begging not to go , and the parents did n't understand why until after the investigation began .
But although this says a lot about the callous indifference of some Wee Care parents , it does n't establish that their children were sexually abused at the day care .
One of the child witnesses was Joey , whose interviews with Fonolleras yielded some of the most shocking accusations ( " We chopped our penises off " ) and the most vehement retractions ( " It 's all lies ! " )
According to Nap Time , Joey loved the day care , " ( Joey ) insisted on going …
Joey ... attended Wee Care nine - to - five , four days a week , and he was fiercely attached .
It was his life . "
" Fiercely attached " to a place where he was allegedly being sexually tortured ?
THE EXPERTS SPEAK
Whether the Wee Care children loved or hated day care , were outgoing or withdrawn , clowning it up or nervous , acting out sexually or wearing three layers of clothing , sucking their thumbs or sassing their parents , they were said to be exhibiting traits of sexual abuse .
It could all be explained , said the prosecution 's expert witness , Eileen Treacy , by the Child Abuse Syndrome , ( the description given to the cluster of behaviors and emotions often displayed by young victims of sex abuse or incest , by a Dr. Suzanne Sgroi . )
Treacy was an attractive and authoritative young woman who was eight years away from obtaining her Ph.D. in psychology but could quote the psychological literature chapter and verse .
She was neither licensed as a therapist in New York , where she worked at a clinic for sexually abused children , nor in New Jersey .
What she lacked in credentials , she covered over with bravado , substituting dogmatic certainty for scientific validity .
Despite Treacy 's lack of academic or research credentials , she evaluated all the Wee Care families , calibrated the amounts of stress in each one , such as the stress brought on by a new baby or a pending divorce , and determined whether there were other " confounding variables " to explain the bedwetting and the stuttering .
She concluded that all but one of the little child witnesses had no tensions in their lives , apart from Kelly Michaels , that could explain the degree of maladjustment they were showing .
She spoke of the behaviors of the children , as reported by their anxious parents , as having a " high degree of correlation , " ( with sexual abuse ) " over point six [ .6 ] in numerical terms of probability , " which gave her testimony a pseudoscientific gloss .
Treacy was on the stand for eight days , presenting the listed behaviors of the syndrome as though they were as reliable an indicator of sex abuse as rash and fever are indicators of measles .
Using the syndrome label , Treacy was able to link a variety of child behaviors to the purported sex abuse , including the fact that one child had an aversion to eating tuna fish .
Treacy also reassured the jury that children did n't lie about sex abuse , and that they could not be pressured , coerced or coached -- as the defense claimed -- into making false accusations .
" It is possible to suggest particular answers to children , " Treacy confidently informed Kelly 's attorney during cross-examination .
" Whether they 'll accept is another matter . "
In Nap Time , Lisa Manshel quotes Treacy 's assertion that the children could not be intimidated into speaking falsely , then two pages later she writes that " Children are taught , in no uncertain terms , to do what they are told ... children should not be expected to have the strength of will to say no to an adult , " by way of explaining how Kelly intimidated them into silence .
Many of the 19 children who testified on closed circuit television from the judge 's chambers , where they yawned , fidgeted , ate potato chips , and spun in their chairs , behaved as though they could not be easily cowed by mere grown - ups .
Little Lewis sassed the judge and the defense attorneys .
" Objection overruled , buster ! " the 6 - year - old yelled at Kelly 's lawyer .
Although the prosecution used an expert witness to testify that the Wee Care children acted like sex - abuse victims , the defense was not allowed to bring in an expert witness to testify that Kelly Michaels did not act like a pervert .
She had no criminal past , no history of child molesting , no unusual episodes in her childhood .
But sex perverts , as everyone knew , did n't have to be dirty old men in raincoats .
They could be anyone , anywhere .
Day after day , for nine grueling months , Kelly heard herself described as a " grotesque liar , " and a monster .
" It was a long trial because they had to make something unbelievable – believable , " she later explained .
" And they piled on so much to wear the jury down .
Really there was no credible evidence or plausibility .
You keep beating the jury day after day after day and you get pseudo - experts – and you can get an expert to say anything , particularly in the psychological field . "
When the jury looked at Kelly and saw a bright , attractive young person , it only demonstrated , as the prosecution said , how devious , how cunning she was !
Was she kind and patient with the children ?
She was only trying to seduce them .
Did she offer to help another teacher ?
She was just trying to get more time alone with her victims .
Manshel enthusiastically took up this theme in her book .
Kelly , for example , was a pretty woman with thick , curly dark hair and nice features , but she was n't cute , she " seemed " cute .
While Fonolleras and the other investigators were conducting their interviews with the children , Manshel sympathetically explained that they sometimes resorted to black humor to get through the horror of it all : " They joked about ' peanut butter and Kelly . ' "
But when Kelly , during her long trial for appalling sex crimes , sometimes laughed and joked with her family , Manshel records that the jury and the media were shocked by their demeanor .
As for physical evidence , the prosecution could offer nothing substantial .
Some children claimed that Kelly had made them urinate in the piano bench in the church 's music room .
The bench was sent to the FBI laboratory to be tested for traces of urine , but the tests came back negative .
Many of the children were examined , and although some had rashes , and one little girl had " notches " in her hymen , no child had lacerations consistent with being raped with a knife , or a perforated intestine from being repeatedly poked with a fork .
And although Kelly was rumored to have taken pictures of the children , no pictures were found .
But the lack of evidence did n't dampen McArdle 's prosecutorial zeal .
It only proved what a sly and cunning creature Kelly Michaels was .
She was an unnatural monster , a succubus who preyed on little children .
Kelly 's seeming ordinariness was a compliment to the zeal and brilliance of the investigating team – they had hunted and trapped a rare creature and brought her in , in chains , to receive her punishment .
Kelly and her family kept hoping and expecting someone -- a juror who'd had lots of kids and who knew darn well that you could n't dress and undress a dozen squirming children in the blink of an eye , or a journalist who was n't overawed by the prosecution 's expert witnesses -- that someone would stand with them and proclaim that the prosecution 's case was ludicrous .
But in the superheated atmosphere of the trial , to question the charges was to question that children could be or were , sexually abused .
Dissension was denial .
To add to Kelly 's nightmare , one of the accusing parents was an editor at the local paper .
During his closing arguments , one of the prosecutors sang the Joni Mitchell song , " Both Sides Now , " the lyrics of which were found scribbled in Kelly 's Wee Care attendance book , as further evidence that Kelly was hiding her sadistic character under her normal exterior :
I 've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down
And still somehow
It 's life 's illusions I recall ...
Kelly could only watch from the prisoner 's dock .
How do you defend yourself against the charge that you like Joni Mitchell ?
Surely that 's only a misdemeanor in New Jersey , not a felony ?
What did it all prove ?
GUILTY
After an extraordinary , unprecedented nine months of testimony , the case was sent to the jury .
The jury deliberated for 13 days , during which time the jurors were allowed to replay some of the videos of the children 's testimony .
They found Kelly guilty .
As she later said , " You 're finished .
Your life is over .
You 're dead .
For all intents and purposes , you 're dead .
And I remember just looking at the jury and saying , " Why ? "
" You have to understand , " says psychiatrist Dr. Lee Coleman , " that these trials are not rational .
You cannot try to explain what happens on the basis of the evidence , or the basis of reason , or anything like that . "
Dr. Coleman has testified at dozens of sexual abuse trials as an expert witness on the reliability of child testimony and the use and misuse of psychiatry in the courtroom .
He believes that jurors , asked to choose between sending an accused molester to jail on scanty evidence or possibly releasing a depraved monster into the community , are swayed by " fear of criticism , the fear if they do n't bring in some kind of conviction , " that they will be perceived as soft on child abuse .
" They will acquit people on dozens and dozens of charges and bring back a few convictions when there 's no possible way you could separate the evidence leading to some versus the evidence leading to the other . "
" The prosecutors thought that ' we 'll just keep throwing so much against the wall day after day after day , ' " Kelly reflected years afterwards , so that the jury concluded " 'even though we can't pinpoint one thing that 's really concrete about any of it , there 's so much of it that something has to be true . ' "
Kelly was indicted on 235 counts but eventually convicted of 115 counts of child abuse .
Ironically , she was acquitted on the charge that she sexually abused Jonathan Moore by sticking a thermometer into his rear – the allegation that started the whole thing .
Kelly was sentenced to 47 years in prison and denied bail pending appeal .
She spent the first 18 months in solitary confinement .
She would have been treated better if she 'd murdered somebody .
SCARS THAT NEVER FELT A WOUND
While Kelly and other day care workers like her in other towns and cities were marched off to prison , cognitive psychologists were investigating the question of young children as witnesses and if young children could be made to agree to , and eventually believe in , things that did n't happen .
This was understandably a difficult area to investigate without harming children .
Obviously it would be unethical to try to persuade preschoolers that somebody had molested them .
But some ingenious experiments , most notably by Stephen Ceci of Cornell University and Maggie Bruck of McGill University in Canada , showed that children could be influenced by adult questioning .
In one experiment , children came to believe that someone had licked their knees and stuck marbles in their ears during a touching game -- intimate contact without the sexual overtones -- even though it had n't happened .
Children could even be persuaded that they had had the painful experience of catching their fingers in a mousetrap .
Children could also be brought to agree that someone else had done bad things , especially if the person they were questioned about was presented to them in a bad light .
In the " Sam Stone " experiment , a man impersonating " Sam Stone , " an acquaintance of the teacher , briefly visited with two groups of preschoolers .
The second group was prepared for his visit by being told that he was clumsy and always breaking things .
In interviews after Sam Stone 's visit , many of the children in the second group agreed that Sam Stone had ripped a book and damaged a teddy bear , even though this had never happened .
In addition to clearly showing how easily young children can be swayed , the researchers investigated the investigators .
They provided erroneous information to adults who were to interview children , and proved that the children 's responses were influenced by the adults ' expectations .
According to Nap Time , during the Wee Care investigation , Peg Foster told the other investigators that if Kelly Michaels used peanut butter in sexual abuse , then she might have used excrement and urine as well .
Immediately afterwards , the first allegations of that sort were recorded .
Lou Fonolleras , Peg Foster , Eileen Treacy and the other Wee Care investigators were confident of their ability to see into the children 's souls and interpret the truth , no matter what the child was actually saying .
Eileen Treacy , for example , told the children , " God gave me a special blessing .
He did .
You know how some big people can't talk to kids too good ?
You know , they do n't seem to listen ? …
Well , you know what ?
God gave me the blessing that I am able to listen and I help kids with this stuff . "
But the cognitive psychologists showed that intuitive judgments , divinely inspired or not , were completely unreliable .
In the " Sam Stone " experiment , videotaped interviews were made of the children from both groups of preschoolers -- those who accurately said that Sam had n't torn up a book , and those who said he had .
These interviews were shown to " approximately 1,000 researchers and clinicians who work on children 's testimonial issues ...
They were asked to decide which of the events reported by the children actually transpired and then to rate the overall credibility of each child . "
" The majority of the professionals were highly inaccurate , " the researchers discovered .
In other words , when watching a child who said that Sam Stone had ripped up a book , something that never happened , the child experts were as likely to say the child was telling the truth as not .
The intuition and empathy of the experts turned out to be a fantasy of their own egos .
Driving the point home , Ceci and Bruck wrote , " Experts who conduct research on the credibility of children 's reports , who provide therapy to children suspected of having been abused , and who carry out law enforcement interviews with children , generally failed to detect which of the children 's claims were accurate and which were not , despite being confident in their judgments . "
Ceci added that one could do as well or better by simply tossing a coin .
The use of " anatomically correct dolls " also came under fire .
In the ' 80s , the only children who came near the special dolls , made with large , prominent genitals , were children who were suspected of having been abused .
In the Wee Care case , as Dorothy Rabinowitz reported in Harper's ,
As a rule , children were given knives and forks and then asked to show -- on an anatomically correct doll -- where Kelly had hurt them .
On the tapes that I heard , the child 's first response more often than not was to poke the doll in the eye or the neck or a knee .
Invariably , the listener then hears the voice of Fonolleras , urging , " Where else ?
Uh - huh , where else ? "
After a succession of " where else ? " responses , the child winds up poking at a penis , or a vagina , or an anus .
Here , the " where else 's " stop .
Later , Fonolleras 's official report typically would note how a child " described " the penetration of her vagina or his anus .
The cognitive researchers gave the dolls to children who had never been suspected of being abused , and saw that many children , when given a doll with breasts , vaginal and anal openings , or a penis and testicles , will touch , poke , pull and insert things .
Again , video tapes of the children at play were shown to experts and again , the experts could not tell , based on the way the children handled the dolls , which children had never been abused and which ones had .
Just as normal children had never been tested with the special dolls , so the shape and variation of normal little girls ' hymens had never been established through large - scale examinations .
This finally occurred after Kelly Michaels and hundreds of others were in prison and it was discovered that there was a great deal of variation in hymeneal openings among little girls and that bumps , notches and ridges were commonplace .
Likewise , at the time of the day - care trials , it was widely believed that if a boy 's anus dilated , or " winked , " during examination , it indicated that he'd been abused , and suspected molesters were sent to prison for life because of testimony about anal " winking . "
But when examinations were conducted on a dozens of young males , it was discovered that anal " winking " was a typical response to the light touch of the examiner 's gloved hand .
These discoveries played an important part in the vindication of some of those convicted of ritual child abuse .
TWO JOURNALISTS FIGHT FOR REASON AND JUSTICE
When public opinion against Kelly Michaels was at its height in 1988 , when she was " the most hated woman in all of New Jersey , " an investigative reporter named Debbie Nathan who worked for a newspaper in El Paso , Tex. came to her aid .
Nathan had investigated a similar case in Texas and Kelly 's parents asked for her help .
Nathan spent two intensive weeks in New Jersey examining the case .
She says she was not surprised at the cold shoulder she got from the prosecution team , but she was surprised that even the local media people were reluctant to talk to her and were even hostile because of her skeptical attitude .
Kelly 's nightmare , meanwhile , continued in prison .
When she had to walk past her fellow prisoners , they cursed at her and threw garbage .
She was sent to a treatment center for sex offenders for evaluation .
" I had to leave in shackles – chains around my ankles and my hands cuffed down at my stomach , " she told Nathan .
" I walked by all ( the other convicts ) and there was total silence .
They just totally stopped what they were doing .
All these guys ; sex offenders who probably have fantasies of women looking just like I did then .
I came back to jail and cried all night . "
Her family continued to travel to New Jersey to visit her almost weekly and brought her audio tapes of family conversations that she could listen to while she was alone and pretend that she was with them once again .
She read , she wrote , she exercised , she prayed .
But " there were times when I did want to bang my head against the wall and just become unconscious and stay that way forever . "
Debbie Nathan wrote a series of critical articles for the Village Voice , slamming the whole day - care , witch - hunt crusade and challenging the pseudoscientific pretensions of those who were sending people to prison for life in the name of protecting children .
Her interest in the subject led her to write other articles and to co-author the book , Satan 's Silence .
Another journalist , Dorothy Rabinowitz , who worked at a New Jersey television station at the time of the trial , wanted to present an on - air editorial criticizing the prosecution and the media coverage of the case , but her station manager demurred .
Angry at being censored , Rabinowitz reviewed the case and interviewed Kelly , her parents , the prosecutors and defense team , and some of the parents .
She came away convinced that Kelly was innocent and wrote a stinging article that exposed the way the child interviews had been conducted .
It 's a measure of the atmosphere in which Nathan and Rabinowitz worked that Rabinowitz 's article , which was originally for Vanity Fair , was not published there and was finally published by Harper 's Magazine in 1990 .
After Rabinowitz 's article came out , Kelly decided to leave the solitude of protective custody and try her luck among the general prison population , although she knew that many of her fellow inmates were victims of child abuse themselves and could well decide to dish out some rough justice .
She began to serve as tutor in the prison 's literacy program and gradually convinced some of the inmates and guards of her innocence .
Essex County still was n't through with her , however .
" I had been ( in prison ) a couple of years , " she recalled recently , " and a bill arrived , literally a bill , from the Public Defender 's Office for over $ 800,000.00 .
( I was ) just walking down to my cell , and I 'm saying , ' I 'm innocent , I did n't do any of these things , yet I have to pay for the pleasure of having been prosecuted wrongfully and serving a 47 - year - sentence for it . ' "
THE APPEAL
Thanks to journalists Nathan and Rabinowitz 's second look at the Wee Care case , an eminent attorney , Morton J. Stavis , was persuaded to come to Kelly 's aid in early 1990 .
He was in his 70s and had had a long and illustrious career as a civil - rights crusader .
He met with Kelly and reviewed her case .
She recalls his indignation when he returned to prison to tell her that he would defend her : " He came back … and he was slamming his fist on the table and he was saying , ' there was no way these things happened , we 're going to defend you , ' and I said , ' but you know what , my parents are all out of money , we have no money to give you . '
And he said , ' We 'll get the money somehow . ' "
Stavis devoted two years to preparing her case for appeal .
In the 33,000 pages of the trial transcript , he found plenty to dispute -- the defense 's hands had been tied from the start , while the prosecution had free rein with the child witnesses .
The use of Eileen Treacy had been grossly inappropriate .
She had helped to choose which children would testify , but she also served as the independent expert vouching for their credibility .
Then there were the damning tapes of the interviews with the Wee Care children .
Robert Rosenthal , a young lawyer who joined the defense team , contacted the researchers Ceci and Bruck and asked them to file an amicus ( friend of the court ) brief ( ( http://www.falseallegations.com/amicus.htm)) which was endorsed and signed by no fewer than 45 other researchers .
This lengthy report outlined the many ways the investigators had misled , coerced , frightened , bullied , and bribed the Wee Care children and how as a result , the children 's testimony was hopelessly tainted .
The researchers pulled no punches in their estimate of the work of Lou Fonolleras and Co. : " The interviews with the children in the Michaels case are some of the worst I have ever heard ... "
Ceci told a reporter .
" The children were undoubtedly abused , but probably not until they met the investigators . "
Finally , a court date was set for the spring of 1993 to argue the appeal .
In December of 1992 , Stavis and his wife were vacationing in California but he made time to pick up and sign the final papers in the case , checking them over one last time before sending them back East .
Then he prepared to take his wife Esther out to dinner .
Back in her prison cell , Kelly learned that while Stavis was walking outside , he stumbled and fell down an embankment and hit his head .
He was dead .
" When my father came to prison to visit me and told me – I still said , ' Dad , we 're going to win . '
Even though it was personally devastating ….
I still felt it was going to be all right .
It turned out that the work ( Stavis ) had done was completed , it was just the oral arguments had n't been heard …
I really believed – and maybe this is youth and naivete -- that the truth would win , it was stronger than the hysteria and the lies and the craziness . "
Out of respect for his longtime friend Stavis , flamboyant , civil - rights lawyer William Kunstler agreed to take over the oral arguments for the Michaels case .
Finally , came the day that Kelly and the Michaels family had hoped for , dreamed of -- the state appellate panel overturned the conviction .
The appeal judges singled out Eileen Treacy 's testimony as being inappropriate , because she was , in effect , used by McArdle to tell the jury to believe the children , when it was the jury 's job to decide which witnesses to believe .
The judges were especially critical about the child interviews , describing them as coercive , highly suggestive , and inept .
Kelly 's lawyers moved quickly to get her released on bail .
Understandably , the Michaels family saw the verdict as a vindication of their daughter 's innocence , although technically all that had happened was that the appellate court had ruled that Kelly 's trial was unfair .
The Star Ledger reported :
Tears were streaming down Michaels 's mother 's face as she rushed out of the courtroom surrounded by family and close friends after the hearing concluded .
One woman gave the white - haired Marilyn Michaels a bouquet of flowers in congratulations .
As Mrs. Michaels pushed through the crowded courtroom , filled with an entourage of reporters and onlookers , she said the family was ecstatic about the judge 's decision .
'' My daughter is innocent .
She has always been , '' Mrs. Michaels said , overcome with emotion .
'' The whole world knows it now .
This means the truth has come out . ''
Parents of the children were stunned at the reversal .
Essex County vowed to retry the case , with the same prosecution team .
As the months passed , the Essex County Prosecutor 's Office continued to defend its prosecution of Kelly , but not as vehemently .
By 1997 , the office was conceding that the interviews of the children were " horrible , " but that no one knew , way back in 1985 , how to interview small children .
" It was a completely gray area back in that time , " claimed the lawyer for McArdle , as though common sense did n't exist 15 years ago .
Investigator : Just tell me -- show me what happened with the wooden spoon .
Let 's go .
Child : I forgot .
Investigator : No , you did n't .
I 'll tell you what , let 's just go to the doll , we wo n't waste any time .
Investigator ( 2 ) : Now listen , you have to behave .
Investigator : Do you want me to tell him to behave ?
Investigator ( 2 ) : Are you going to be a good boy ?
Huh ?
You have to be good .
Yes or no ?
Child : Yes .
AFTERMATH
The appellate court had ruled that the children 's testimony was so corrupted by the leading questions asked by the investigators that a " taint hearing " had to be held to determine if any of the children 's testimony could be considered valid , or if it was too tainted .
This would be akin to unscrambling an egg , and Essex County appealed the decision to the New Jersey Supreme Court .
In June 1994 , the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court 's ruling – no new trial without a taint hearing .
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Embassy/9062/witchhunt/Wee_Care/supreme.txt
The problem of bringing back the child witnesses , after so much doubt had been cast on their testimony , proved to be insurmountable for the prosecution team .
After spending over $ 3 million to prosecute her , Essex County dropped the indictment against Kelly Michaels in December 1994 .
The $ 800,000 bill for her defense was not officially withdrawn , but she has not been pursued for the money .
Kelly , by then 32 , was free .
But , " being technically not guilty is not the same as being completely innocent , " she reflected .
" You cling to that difference when you walk into a courtroom and people spit at you , or when you 're sitting in a cell and all around you people are screaming filthy names at you .
That difference , it 's everything . "
After her release from prison , Kelly Michaels was staying with Morton Stavis 's widow in New York , when she agreed to give an interview to a freelance journalist who was also a lawyer .
Partway through the interview , he was so moved by her story and so convinced of her sincerity , that he turned off his tape recorder .
Soon afterwards , he asked her for a date .
They are now married and have four children .
She says that she does n't spend a lot of time dwelling on the past , but " the prayer I have is that someone will come to me … maybe a parent or a child all grown up , and say 'we got sucked into this horrible madness , and looking back we see that it just did n't happen , and I was led by these experts to believe … and I 'm really sorry . ' "
In May 1999 , the District Court dismissed Michaels ' lawsuit to hold Essex County , McArdle , Lou Fonolleras , Eileen Treacy , Peg Foster , and others responsible for the harm and the horror they visited on her and the financial ruin they brought to her parents .
She adds that she and her family are not the only victims of the Wee Care case , there are the deluded parents and children as well , and the millions wasted on prosecuting her case , " taxpayer 's money … ( that ) could have been used to help children . "
http://vls.law.vill.edu/locator/3d/Jun2000/995486.txt
Sara McArdle is now deputy assistant prosecutor at Essex County .
In Nap Time , she is reported as wondering , " Why are people afraid to show children normal affection ?
It makes me so sad that people think hugging a child is going to make him accuse them of sexual abuse . "
She was apparently oblivious to the answer -- the reason people are afraid to hug children is because of people like McArdle .
Although she discussed the investigation with Lisa Manshel while Nap Time was being written , she declines interviews about Wee Care today .
Eileen Treacy is now a professor at Lehmann College in New York City .
She has continued her second career as a trial expert who trains others in " how to recognize , treat and prevent occurrences of sexual abuse . "
Peg Foster is still with Children 's Hospital in Newark working in the field of child abuse diagnosis and prevention .
She still believes that Kelly Michaels tortured dozens of children with cutlery and peanut butter , but feels the court battle has led to improved child - interviewing techniques .
She is in what she used to like to call " denial . "
Lou Fonolleras , whose interviews of the Wee Care children completely corrupted the case , is still an employee of the Department of Youth and Family Services .
He declined to be interviewed .
A spokesman for DYFS says that Fonolleras has been working at an office job , not with children , for the past nine years .
Lisa Manshel , the author of Nap Time , became a lawyer .
She declined to be interviewed .
The Wee Care children are now young adults .
Many have been in therapy for years .
To date , no Wee Care parents have publicly retracted their accusations against their child 's former teacher .
Some of the families have received financial settlements from the day care 's insurance company .
The last of these suits was settled in June 2001 .
The amounts paid to the families is undisclosed .
THE ROAD TO HELL
Kelly Michaels 's case , in its broad outlines , followed the same pattern as other infamous day - care cases of the ' 80s – McMartin , Fells Acres , Country Walk .
During the 1980s many people came to believe that as soon as the parents ' taillights disappeared over the hill at the neighborhood day care , the staff -- people with ordinary names like Peggy and Brenda , Bernie and Chip -- dropped their friendly poses and preyed on their young charges with every type of perversion known to man and some no one could have imagined .
Children spoke of having their heads dunked in buckets of blood , of being tied naked to trees , being forced to mutilate animals and kill babies , of being transported through underground tunnels , or spirited away by airplane , of being brutally assaulted sexually and used in child pornography .
And to ensure the children 's silence , they said they were threatened that Mommy and Daddy would be killed , their house would be burned down , that they must never , ever tell .
According to some true believers – social workers , police detectives and prosecutors -- these macabre scenes were playing out in dozens of day cares – and had been for years .
Some leaders of the crusade against child abuse believed that there was , in fact , a coordinated conspiracy going on – that sex rings had infiltrated the day cares and were using children to produce child pornography or even recruiting the kids in Satanism .
Their campaign was , quite literally , a witch hunt .
According to investigative journalist Debbie Nathan , " research shows that between 1984 and 1995 , at least 185 adults nationwide , about half of them women , were charged with ritualized sexual abuse .
Of those , 113 were convicted , mainly on the word of young children . "
( Not all of the accused were day - care workers , some were bus drivers , some were parents and grandparents , some , like Patrick Figured of North Carolina , currently serving a life sentence , simply knew someone who owned a day care . )
The ritual abuse day - care cases usually start with one suspicious parent .
Thefirst ritual abuse case was the infamous McMartin School case in California .
There , the initial accusations were made by a mother , later diagnosed as a schizophrenic , who was convinced that someone was abusing her 2 - year - old son because his bottom was red .
Her son started attending McMartin after she had dropped him off unannounced in front of the school , and drove away .
The staff looked after him and later allowed the mother to enroll him , out of pity for the child .
Later , her paranoid accusations against the Buckey family who owned and operated the day care led to the longest and most expensive trial in U.S. history , in which the Buckeys were eventually acquitted , but not before spending years in prison .
Once parental suspicion is aroused , for whatever reason , the anxious parents –naturally enough -- contact the authorities .
In ritual - abuse cases , a familiar scenario begins .
The authorities warn all the parents to be on the look out for signs of sexual abuse .
Panic ensues .
The children are questioned and re-questioned by parents and counselors .
Denials are ignored .
The children , pressured to " disclose , " start to make allegations that range from the bizarre to the impossible .
Whether charges were laid or not does n't seem to depend on the credibility of the allegations but upon the credulity of the investigators : Parents in both Roseburg , Ore. , and Cape Cod , Mass . , for example , believed their children had participated in satanic rituals that included murdering people .
In Roseburg , three people were convicted and sent to prison ; but in Cape Cod , the prosecutor 's office refused to press charges and concluded that the children 's stories were a " hoax , " a fantasy .
( No dead people were found in either case . )
But although children were questioned about masks , candles , chanting , and upside down crosses , these elements were not always introduced into the courtroom and juries were asked to pass judgment on comparatively straightfoward cases of molestation and rape .
The prosecutor in the Gallup Christian Day Care case openly admitted that Mr. and Mrs. Gallup and their son Chip were prosecuted not as Satanists but as child molesters , although he believed that Mrs. Gallup , a white haired minister 's wife , had been torturing children in satanic rituals for 20 years .
He believed that " the Gallups and some of the workers were sexually interacting amongst themselves and with the small children … they watched reruns of these videos and they were fed popcorn and ( there were ) incidents of animal torture and so we had to decide how we were doing to deal with that aspect of the case and so we focused our first two cases in particular on simple cases because we knew that the jury was going to have a terrible time of believing that kind of a situation . "
The children in the Wee Care case were also questioned about robes and crucifixes .
It appears that juries were not always given the opportunity to judge the investigation in its entirety and understand the context in which the allegations were gathered .
Not only were juries kept in the dark about fantastical allegations and impossible and conflicting testimony , so were the defendants .
Jenny Wilcox and Robert Aldridge of Ohio spent 11 years in prison before their conviction was overturned .
According to the Ohio Observer , Wilcox 's lawyer " said evidence suggested that ( in the original trial ) prosecutors had received a 29 - page report from police on the case but only provided defense attorneys with a sanitized eight - page report that left out details of …wildly varying statements by other children and denials by others . "
Like Kelly Michaels , Wilcox and Aldridge have not been allowed to sue for wrongful prosecution and false imprisonment .
In neither case has the state admitted it made a mistake in prosecuting them , and even if mistakes were made in collecting evidence , the prosecution has immunity from being sued for errors .
THE VERDICT OF HISTORY
While the verdict of the court , labeling the unfortunate accused as sick child molesters , still stands in many cases , the verdict of history is slowly changing .
More and more people now believe that the Great Day - Care Witch Hunt was a collective fantasy of prosecutors , social workers and frightened parents .
Historians of the day - care witch hunt have pointed to several factors that led to the panic : the mass exodus of mothers from the home to the workplace in the ' 70s and ' 80s , which gave rise to a lot of stress and free - floating guilt and , in some quarters , condemnation ; then there were the pioneering child - protection crusaders , flush with new federal dollars to ferret out abuse ; and the vulnerability of minimum - wage child care providers who found themselves cast in the role of the bogeyman in the closet .
At the same time the country was enjoying frightening itself with titillating stories of human sacrifice and child torture in books such as Michelle Remembers , which spelled out in graphic detail how Satanists would go to any extreme to get children and do horrible things to them .
Michelle Remembers and several other supposed memoirs of life in the coven have been exposed as hoaxes .
No child pornography involving children from any of the suspect day cares has ever been found .
And there 's no physical evidence that any of the day - care centers were turned into torture chambers at all .
No corpses of slaughtered animals and babies .
No cages .
No tunnels .
When the controversy was at its height , Dr. Roland Summit , an advocate for the belief that satanic sex rings were operating all over the country , said that although the claims made by the child witnesses were fantastic , it was impossible to suppose that the little ones could make the stories up out of whole cloth :
There 's been a great effort to understand … how it could n't be true .
And the best answer people seem to come up with is the notion that therapists or police investigators are brainwashing the children into telling crazy stories .
Why these people would want children to tell unbelievable stories that make them look stupid , make the investigators look stupid , has never been explained in that theory .
But , there is a great willingness to believe that children will say anything in order to please adults …
I think if we look at the coalition of data as it comes together , there 's no way children have made these things up .
No one has searched more diligently for evidence of satanic ritual abuse than Ken Lanning of the FBI .
He looked into over 12,000 allegations of ritual abuse and concluded there was no hidden satanic network .
(( http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_rep03.htm)).
As he put it , in his 1992 report :
The large number of people telling the same story is , in fact , the biggest reason to doubt these stories .
It is simply too difficult for that many people to commit so many horrendous crimes as part of an organized conspiracy .
Two or three people murder a couple of children in a few communities as part of a ritual , and nobody finds out ?
Possible .
Thousands of people do the same thing to tens of thousands of victims over many years ?
Not likely .
Hundreds of communities all over America are run by mayors , police departments , and community leaders who are practicing Satanists and who regularly murder and eat people ?
Not likely .
But Lanning did find a group of people who were assiduously trading how - to information about satanic rituals coast - to - coast .
It was the investigators and social workers themselves .
The Los Angeles Ritual Abuse Task Force , for example , distributed thousands of copies of a pamphlet with the warning signs of satanic abuse including " fear of death , " or " aversion to attending church . "
The author , therapist Catherine Gould , and her fellow committee members later became convinced that the evil Satanists were trying to poison them .
Lanning concluded , " until hard evidence is obtained and corroborated , the public should not be frightened into believing that babies are being bred and eaten , that 50,000 missing children are being murdered in human sacrifices , or that Satanists are taking over America 's day - care centers or institutions .
No one can prove with absolute certainty that such activity has not occurred .
The burden of proof , however , as it would be in a criminal prosecution , is on those who claim that it has occurred . "
STILL IN PRISON
If the diligent hunt for satanic ritual abusers has come up empty , why are there , by one estimate , over a dozen convicted ritual abusers still in prison ?
http://members.shaw.ca/imaginarycrimes/othercases.htm
Gerald Amirault is in prison in Massachusetts where his legal battle to overturn his conviction has ground to a halt .
His conviction was based on children 's testimony collected by the same kinds of interviewing techniques used in the Michaels case .
He has asked the governor of Massachusetts for a pardon and a commutation of his sentence to time served , 15 years so far .
His mother and sister were also convicted of abuse and released from prison after serving eight years , maintaining their innocence throughout .
Violet Amirault , Gerald 's mother , died in 1997 , hoping to the last that her son would be freed .
Update : Since this article was written , Gerald Amirault has been paroled from prison after serving 18 years .
He lives with his wife and children .
Bernard Baran was arrested in 1984 and convicted for allegedly molesting three preschoolers at the day care where he worked .
He was only 19 years old .
The initial accusation against him came from the parent of a little boy who accused Baran of touching her son .
She was a drug addict who periodically lost custody of her child .
The other accusations against Baran arose after the other parents learned about the first accusation .
The medical evidence against Baran was similar to that brought against Kelly Michaels – that is , it was non-existent .
Baran 's mother had no money to mount a proper legal defense for him .
Baran is still in prison , also in Massachusetts , a victim of prejudice and hysteria .
http://www.freebaran.org/.
Update : Since this article was written , Bernard Baran 's conviction was overturned in June , 2006 ( http://ncrj.org/BaranPR.html) on the grounds that the portions of the interviews with the children were not shown to the jury .
The remaining videotapes of the interviews showed that the children denied " Bernie " hurt them until repeatedly prompted .
Baran spent 22 years in prison .
Patrick Figured was sentenced to prison for life for allegedly abusing three toddlers at his girlfriend 's mother 's day care .
The allegations against him and his girlfriend , Sonja Hill , were preposterous and included burning bibles and forcing the children to drink blood .
Jurors ignored testimony that Figured , an electronics company executive , was never alone with the children and had very little to do with them .
The anal " winking " test helped sentence Figured to three life terms .
He is currently incarcerated in North Carolina 's Nash Correctional Institution .
http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_smith.htm
Frances and Dan Keller :
If you were accused of burying children alive with animals , painting pictures with bones dipped in blood , digging up and dismembering bodies , torturing animals , running a child brothel and sacrificing infants to Satan , what would you do ?
Frances and Dan Keller of Austin , Texas , decided to flee to Las Vegas , which did n't help them when they came to trial .
Fran Keller ran a daycare out of their home , complete with a pony in the backyard .
She and her husband were accused of sexually assaulting all of the babies and toddlers in their care .
The accusations started with one little girl who had been seeing a therapist for behavior problems before she attended the daycare .
The Travis County Sheriff 's Office investigated .
Soon the children were accusing deputy sheriffs of being abusers as well .
( Two were charged but the charges were eventually dropped . )
Some of the children went to a therapist who believed that Satanic Ritual Abuse was a secret network devised by the CIA and Nazi scientists .
Dan Keller 's lawyer suggested that the children got their horror stories from the movie Pet Sematary .
In 1992 , The Kellers were sentenced to 48 years in prison each and are still in prison today .

Getting Real : Reflecting on the New Look of National Park Service Maps

INTRODUCTION
This paper examines the techniques being developed by the U.S. National Park Service ( NPS ) Division of Publications for designing plan ( 2D ) maps with a faux realistic look .
The NPS produces tourist maps for 385 parks in a system spanning a large swath of the Earth ’s surface from the Caribbean to Alaska to the South Pacific , and which is visited by nearly 300 million people each year .
Many park visitors are inexperienced map readers and non-English speakers .
In our ongoing effort to make NPS maps accessible to everyone , the design of NPS maps over time has become less abstract and increasingly realistic , particularly in the depiction of mountainous terrain and natural landscapes ( Figure 1 ) .
Many of the techniques discussed herein are borrowed from or inspired by 3D mapping ( Patterson , 1999 ) .
However , the scope of my paper deals exclusively with plan mapping a format that has received scant attention in the digital era in regard to abstract vs. realistic depiction compared to the 3D world .
It is also the format in which the majority of NPS maps will continue to be made .
Figure 1 . Crater Lake , Oregon .
( right to left ) NPS maps have become more accurate , detailed , and realistic in appearance over the past two decades , while at the same time retaining their familiar clean design .
The 1980s map uses isobaths to show depths in Crater Lake , the only elevation isolines ever to be published on an NPS map .
The 1995 map uses hand - drawn bathymetry .
The 2002 map , produced entirely from digital sources , combines a forest cover texture with shaded relief .
Why realism ?
The move to more realistic map design by the NPS has been gradual and unplanned .
Using graphical software applications that allow sophisticated designs to be routinely produced that were previously only imagined , the NPS has found itself inextricably drawn toward using greater realism .
Cartography is not alone in this trend .
Realism has become ubiquitous in almost every graphical medium today from television to print publishing to multimedia .
For example , the graphical user interface ( GUI ) of Mac OS X , the virtual environment in which I am now immersed , uses soft drop shadows , transparency , pulsing 3D buttons , and a soothing aqua desktop to hide its complex
Unix underpinnings from the casual computer user ( me ) .
The enhanced realism of NPS maps has a similar aimsparing the park visitor from the off - putting technical aspects of conventional cartography with a map user interface ( MUI ) that is more user - friendly and that simultaneously delivers relevant and accurate information .
Webster ’s dictionary defines realism , in the artistic sense , as :  The picturing in art and literature of people and things as it is thought they really are , without idealizing . 
Applying this definition to maps is problematic because all maps ( and even many remotely sensed images ) are idealized representations of the Earth and are inherently abstract .
On the other hand , most of us would agree that some maps appear more realistic and are more intuitively comprehensible than others .
For example , a shaded relief map with terrain represented by softly modulated light and shadows appears more realistic than a contour map with a multitude of lines connecting points of equal elevation value .
When depicting maps realistically , we are constrained by the finite limits of graphical methodsonly so much is possible on a 2D surface and our pre-conceived ideas of how the Earth appears from above .
Geographic , graphic , and perceptual reality are often at odds with one another and must be reconciled by the cartographer in order to design a map with realistic characteristics .
With increased realism , map use becomes more a matter of looking rather than reading .
Compared to conventional maps , realistic maps are , undeniably , dumbed downusers have to grapple with fewer abstractions , and intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to think abstractly .
However , by avoiding the use of abstract symbolization , realistic maps have the potential to communicate more efficiently to a greater number of users .
Think of this as the cartographic implementation of universal design .
Users can comprehend realistically portrayed map information relatively effortlessly without explanation ( such as text and legends ) , so they can spend more of their limited time extracting essential information and examining spatial relationships .
Maps designed in a realistic manner also have the potential to be more attractive , even beautiful , compared to their conventional counterparts .
This is not a frivolous concern when trying to connect with audiences .
In this media - driven age of short attention spans , it is important that we design maps that attract and hold a reader ’s attention .
People purchase expensive cars based solely on color , vote for telegenic political candidates , and invest substantial sums in corporations that publish slick annual reports .
Are map users any less susceptible to the allure of attractive packaging ?
Finally , making more realistic NPS maps is a personal interest .
Today , for the first time cartographers have the tools and data available to push the limits of map design with relative ease .
Using new technology and data to design better maps for park visitors is , for me , irresistible .
LOOKING BACK
Realistic map design is not by any means new to cartography .
Among the most spectacular and enduring efforts in cartographic realism are those made by 20th century artist / cartographers .
Artist / cartographers
In the 1950s Hal Shelton , an employee of the USGS and an accomplished fine artist , painted small - scale plan maps of the US to be used by air travelers for general orientation .
Shelton ’s maps were unique in that they portrayed land coverforest , agricultural land , and built - up areasin combination with shaded relief to mimic what passengers would actually see on the ground from an aircraft .
On Shelton ’s maps land cover was portrayed more prominently than the terrain .
Many of Shelton ’s original pieces , still under copyright protection , are housed at the US Library of Congress where they may be viewed by appointment only .
Meanwhile , on the other side of the Atlantic , Eduard Imhof ’s painted map of Walensee , Switzerland is perhaps the most famous example of early cartographic realism ever produced ( Figure 2 ) .
I mhof ’s piece is noteworthy for its artistic use of strong colors to model topography , which is combined with less dominant land cover .
Deep reds are used at higher elevations to give mountain peaks visual loft , blue - gray haze suppresses the lowlands , and cast shadows thrown by steep mountains extend onto the aqua green surface of Walensee .
Holding true to the Swiss cartographic preference , cliffs receive considerable textural detail while agricultural fields and forests are depicted with flat color .
Drainages and light colored roads are slightly incised into the landscape , as a viewer would expect them to be when viewed from above .
The Walensee map was painted experimentally to showcase the unrestrained application of art in the cartographic context .
The resulting masterpiece is on permanent display at the Swiss Alpine Museum in Berne .
However , despite the accolades , Imhof was opposed to the idea that his Walensee map would serve as a model for general cartographic design .
According to Imhof
 What is achieved by such painting experiments ?
When successful , beautiful impressions , natural plan - view landscape pictures result the pictures that please the hearts of many viewers .
But the end result is not a map .
Paintings such as these are unable to provide , anywhere and in any respect , the topographic , conceptual and metric information which one expects from a map ( Imhof , 1982 ) .
Although I mhof ’s words are unequivocally discouraging , it is important to remember the context in which they were written .
Recognizing that few other people possessed the artistic ability and geographic expertise to paint maps such as Walensee , that the technology of the day was inadequate for the mass reproduction of painted maps , and that cartographic employers were not demanding such products , his admonitions were , it seems , intended to keep impressionable students from wasting their time .
The Walensee map is a tempting but forbidden fruit .
One can only speculate about what Imhof might have said differently had he lived long enough to experience the widespread adaptation of DEMs , Photoshop , the Internet , and other digital tools .

Aerial photograph maps
While Shelton and Imhof were exploring map realism via art , others were pursuing a more technical approach using aerial photographs ( and later satellite images ) .
A snapshot of the Earth from above , aerial photographs are the ultimate in geo-realism providing cartographers with a means to deliver pure and uncensored geographic information to the reader ( Keller , 2000 ) .
And aerial photograph maps are easy to make .
Just place some type and lines on rectified aerial photography , such as a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle ( DOQ ) , and the map is finished , and you can go to lunch .
Despite these advantages , outside of the engineering , surveying , and scientific fields , aerial photograph maps have not caught on for general cartographic use .
Aerial photographs contain inherent flaws , particularly in mountainous areas , that translate poorly to the graphical format of maps .
Flaws include :
• Relief inversion - Most aerial photographs and satellite images are taken in mid morning when the atmosphere is clear and when sunlight originates from the lower right or southeast ( in the northern hemisphere ) .
Shaded relief illuminated from this direction is highly susceptible to relief inversion , an optical illusion in which mountains and valleys appear to be inverted .
Although it is possible to adjust embedded shadowing in aerial photographs to counter relief inversion in relatively flat areas ( Rudnicki , 2000 ) , the technique is not applicable in high mountains .
• Cast shadows - Shadows cast by high , steep terrain often obscure important information on adjacent slopes and flat areas .
They also cause drainages to appear misregistered with terrain and can disfigure an image with unsightly dark blotches .
Cast shadows are impossible to remove when their density approaches 100 percent .
• Information overload - Aerial photographs show raw , unfiltered data in all its confusing glory .
Untrained readers may find the minute detail to be fascinating , but few actually understand what they are seeing .
• Inappropriate information -
Do we really need to see parking lots , power lines , construction sites , and Christo art ?
• Invisible information - Small buildings , trails and streams often cannot be seen through dense forest canopies .
Clouds , which tend to persist over mountainous regions , and their shadows obscure the ground below .
• No visual hierarchy - From above , a park visitor center and a nearby sewage treatment facility might appear equally significant .
• Temporal sensitivity - For better or worse , aerial photographs show us a single moment in time .
By the time the map is made , an image taken of a farm field could have been replaced with suburban homes , a glacier could have melted , or a winter - bare deciduous forest may be in leaf .
Notwithstanding these shortcomings , aerial photographs have been used to produce realistic maps .
Most innovative , perhaps , are the South Pacific island maps , including Aitutaki , Cook Islands , produced by the New Zealand Department of Survey and Land Information during the 1970s .
On the Aitutaki map , terrestrial areas are shown in a competent and conventional cartographic manner .
However , the depiction of water is unique ( Figure 2 ) .
Using a colorized aerial photograph to show areas below sea level only , coral reefs , shoals , and surf breaks are shown with detail and clarity that can not be achieved with conventional cartographic methods .
Relief inversion and cast shadows are not a problem because coral reefs are essentially flat and covered by a layer of shallow water that diffuses otherwise troublesome southeast illumination .
By selectively integrating conventional cartography and aerial photography , the Aitutaki map points to the approach used by the NPS for realistic mapping .
NPS APPROACH
The NPS uses a multi-disciplinary approach for bringing realism to its maps .
The artistic inspiration of Shelton and I mhof can be found in our products , as can bits and pieces of aerial photographs and satellite images , DEMs , and vector geodata , all of which are combined selectively and with subtlety in Adobe Photoshop and other graphical software applications ( Figure 3 ) .
Realistically designed NPS maps are not photorealistic .
Instead , they are a stylized view of the Earth as seen through a powerful graphical lens , which attempts to show landscapes not as they actually are but how readers might expect or desire them to look .
Figure 3 . The Wigwams , Grand Teton National Park , Wyoming .
Combining and manipulating a USGS DOQ ( left top ) and DLG and DEM data ( left bottom ) in Adobe Photoshop results in a more realistic map ( right ) .
The making of realistic NPS maps is an opportunistic enterprise used only when special conditions are met .
The availability of high quality data is the most critical requirement .
A missing piece of key information can prevent the transformation to realism from happening .
Time and money are also important considerations , because realistic maps are elaborate productions that take considerably longer to complete than their conventional counterparts .
Finally , one must identify a NPS map situation that would benefit significantly from realistic design treatment not every NPS map is a suitable candidate , particularly those in urban areas or maps that emphasize property ownership .
But , when excellent data is at hand , schedules are open , and a suitable project identified , realistic map design is an option to consider .
On those NPS maps that receive realistic design treatment , some classes of map information are more suitable for realistic depiction than others .
In general , physical landscape features are highly suited , cultural features less so , and explanatory elements not at all ( Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 .
On NPS maps , physical features are more apt to be portrayed realistically than cultural and explanatory map elements .
To design realistic maps , the NPS attempts to consolidate all physical features shaded relief , land cover , drainages , etc. as a single graphical entity .
By grouping physical features together on one level , the base , the visual hierarchy of the entire map is simplified , which allows cultural and explanatory information to be seen more legibly above .
Although physical features occupy the same visual level , they can be made to appear distinct from one another by using graphical special effects .
Four rules for realistic map design :
1 ) Remove lines -
As shown by their use in prehistoric cave art and children ’s drawings , lines are the most rudimentary form of graphical expression .
They are also much loved and over used by map makers .
Strong in form and visually distracting , lines are extremely rare in the natural world .
Take them off your map wherever possible .
2 ) Rasterize - Vectors and realism are incompatible .
Rasterizing vector lines and fills in Photoshop makes them less artificial and more organic .
Rasterizing also sets the stage for later exotic filter manipulations that can be applied only to pixels ( Figure 5 ) .
3 ) Modulate tones - Just as lines are rare in nature , so to are perfectly flat area tones .
Seemingly flat surfaces such as water bodies , ice fields , and deserts contain subtle tonal variations that need to be emphasized .
4 ) Texturize - Graphical noise and embossed textures give selected area tones , such as cliffs and forests and even rasterized lines , a tactile appearance that more closely mimics nature ( Figure 6 ) .

( right )
The hachures are rasterized and lightly filtered in Photoshop to appear more rock like .
Figure 6 . Grand Teton National Park , Wyoming .
( left ) Conventional shaded relief .

Land cover textures embossed onto the shaded relief surface .
Applying the rules mentioned above to the design of realistic maps requires utmost restraint .
Not only is the philosophy for designing realistic maps somewhat different from that of conventional cartography , so too are the production techniques used to apply these designs .
Although merging physical landscape features can yield spectacularly realistic results , the potential for a disaster is also high the cartographer must put more physical information than ever before on a rasterized base map using unfamiliar techniques .
A light touch is required .
For example , applying an embossed forest texture on a map any heavier than a mere hint creates distracting noise that obliterates shaded relief and other raster information below ( Figure 6 ) .
To help see whether the merged physical elements on a realistic map are in graphical balance , try viewing the map on screen at large and small scales .
A map that may look perfectly legible at any given spot at 100 percent scale may not work as well when viewed in its entirety at thumbnail size , and vice versa .
The objective is to create a map that appears realistic and legible at both macro and micro scales .
The design of realistic maps depends heavily on a reader ’s observations and perceptions of natural phenomena , particularly when choosing color .
Even USGS topographic maps , which are quintessentially conventional , use earth brown for printing contour lines , light green for forests , and blue for water .
Determining the degree of literalness in which to portray natural phenomena on a map is an imprecise art .
A flexible design approach is essential for success .
The cartographer must be mindful that the unrestrained pursuit of realism can yield unsatisfactory results , and that even realistically designed maps sometimes need to resort to conventional solutions out of graphical necessity .
For example , to an observer deep in the Grand Canyon , the silt - laden Colorado River is the same color as the terra cotta landscape through which it flows .
Showing the Colorado River and Grand Canyon topography in their natural colors on a map would camouflage the river from readers .
In a pragmatic nod to cartographic convention , the compromise would be to depict the river as an impure shade of blue .
TECHNIQUES
This section briefly describes specific techniques used by the NPS for making more realistic maps .
Aquafication
The depiction of hydrography on conventional maps is usually a perfunctory exercise .
Drainages and shorelines are drawn as vectors shown as uniformly thin blue ( or cyan ) lines , and water bodies are filled with a flat tint of the same color .
Hydrography produced in such a workmanlike manner appears mechanical and is discordant with other physical elements on the map .
By contrast , on realistically designed maps hydrography is given a softer , more natural appearance .
The idea is for the hydrography to become a harmonious part of the landscape ( Figure 7 ) .
The key to achieving aquafication is to remember that lines are seldom found in nature therefore , all casings are removed from oceans , lakes , and double - line rivers .
Drainages are made to appear more natural by tapering widths based on their relative size and direction of flow a tedious technique that is a throwback to our pen and ink cartographic forebears .
However , it is relatively easy to taper drainages in a program like Adobe Illustrator using custom brushes .
A library of custom brushes can be built to represent various thin - to - thick tapering progressions , which are easily applied to stream vectors ( Nelson , 1999 ) .
In the aquafication process , all hydrographic features , including water bodies and tapered drainages , should be assigned the same color ( avoid using pure cyan ) and rasterized as a single layer in Photoshop .
Once in Photoshop , subtle adjustments can be applied to give the hydrography a more realistic appearance .
By adjusting the opacity , blending mode , and color of the layer , hydrography can be given just the right amount of prominence compared to other physical landscape elements .
As a final touch , sun glints ( a form of modulation ) can be added to water bodies and rivers by applying light tone with the airbrush tool and a big soft brush .
Figure 7 . Grand Teton National Park .
Hydrography harmoniously integrated into the cartographic landscape .
As a general rule , water bodies are blank space on maps .
They are a convenient dumping ground for legends , text notes , and photographs that pertain to terrestrial areas , usually the prime focus of the map .
The secondary status of water bodies on maps , and their constantly changing appearance in nature , also provides cartographers with a blank canvas for applying realistic special effects not applicable to terrestrial areas where conflicts with primary information are a concern .
Special effects on water surfaces are more than artistic embellishments .
They can improve map communication .
For example , a sun glint strategically placed near a shoreline park visitor center can be used to subconsciously draw the reader ’s attention to that area .
Other special effects can imply environmental phenomena .
By showing a wave pattern only on the choppier windward shore , the leeward and windward shores of a tropical island can be differentiated ( Figure 8 ) .
Figure 8 . Kohala , Hawaii : ( left ) The Pacific Ocean depicted as flat blue .
( right )
Waves , breaking surf , and a leeward sun glint suggest prevailing northeast trade winds without having to use labels .
Clouds are optional .
More precise mapping is possible with artistic embellishments on water .
For example , a partially submerged reef can be mapped , albeit indirectly , by showing its effect on water breaking surf by transferring an image of the surf from a registered aerial photograph .
The NPS has used a similar technique to map rapids on the Potomac River at Great Falls Park , Virginia .
Finally , a discussion of aquafication would not be complete without mentioning the portrayal of ocean floors and lake bottoms with shaded relief and continuous tone depth tints ( Figures 1 and 12 ) .
Popularized by the ocean floor maps published by National Geographic , this style of bathymetric depiction is being used increasingly on NPS maps to show connectivity between underwater and terrestrial environments .
Texture substitution
The textures found on aerial photographs contain a wealth of rich visual cues for differentiating land cover .
Forest canopies often appear hummocky , rocky areas can be rough and fractured , and agricultural fields appear as a patchwork of mottled tones .
However , except for some water features , transferring these textures directly to a map is not feasible because of the inherent flaws in aerial photographs discussed earlier .
A technique known as texture substitution can be used to partially circumvent this problem .
Here ’s how it works .
Using an aerial photograph or satellite image ( registered to a base map ) , land cover is carefully delineated as Photoshop selections with pixel - level precision .
These selections are then transferred to the base map , where they are filled with generic land cover textures cloned from the aerial photograph , or even from other photographs ( Figure 9 ) .
The result is a reconstituted final product that selectively brings the best traits of aerial photographs their often eye - catching beauty , realism , rich textures , and tiny details that readers find so fascinating to the familiar and readable format of a map .
Maps created with texture substitution appear more like a picture of a detailed physical model than an aerial photograph .
On aerial photographs textures begin coalescing at scales smaller than 1:50,000 ( Imhof , 1982 ) .
This problem can be solved by substituting large - scale textures onto a small - scale map .
The results of this procedure look surprisingly plausible and natural .
Figure 9 .

( bottom )
The same land cover reduced from 18 to 5 categories on the park visitor map .
The substituted forest texture was cloned from an aerial photograph taken near San Francisco , California .
The selection of appropriate generic textures to substitute is a critical consideration for preventing a map from turning into a grossly inaccurate caricature .
Substituted textures must accurately characterize the land cover being depicted , with just enough variability to look authentic .
However and this is extremely important the variability must also be small and inconsequential in nature so it does n't mislead readers with false information .
Substituted textures should be completely avoided on very large - scale maps , because at these scales the generalized textures would be a blatantly incorrect replacement for actual detail .
Substituted textures look most natural when used inside complex land cover selections as opposed to generalized selections ( Figure 9 ) .
Alternating textured / nontextured areas produces a tessellation that compliments the texture pattern as a whole .
With some classes of land cover , such as forests , a slight amount of 3D embossment ( known as bump mapping in 3D applications ) applied to forest polygons themselves suggests a forest edge rising above adjacent non-forested areas ( Nighbert , 2001 ) .
The orientation of the tiny highlights and shadows on an embossed 3D texture must synchronize with the illumination and shadows on the shaded reliefusually from an assumed light source in the upper left .
In general , textures should be used sparingly on a map .
Keep in mind that not every type of land cover warrants or is suitable for texturized portrayal .
On NPS maps land cover textures are mostly used to depict forests , glaciers , lava flows , and rocky peaks .
Other classes of land cover are left untextured to give the reader ’s eyes a place to rest .
When aerial photograph textures are not suitable for texture substitution , manual touchups and synthetic texturing ( both done in Photoshop ) are the options of last resort .
If these techniques must be used they should be printed lightly and applied to polymorphous features , such as sand dunes or glaciers , where cartographic accuracy is elusive under the best of circumstances ( Figure 10 ) .

Glaciers in nature can be untidy .

A manually enhanced depiction of the same area without medial and lateral moraines and blotchy patches of dirt , snow , and ice .
The glacier snout has been given a domed appearance and a texture to suggest disintegrating ice .
Smooth virgin ice and snow is shown at higher elevations .
Illuminated relief
The illuminated relief technique enhances shaded relief combined with land cover textures .
Normally , combining shaded relief and land cover textures on a map involves graphical compromise .
Together these elements are not as effective as when they stand alone , especially shaded relief , which has a wispier appearance compared to land cover textures .
When illuminated relief is used , supplemental illumination and shadowing enhance topographic modeling by also lightening and darkening land cover textures .
The technique uses adjustment layers and alpha channels to manipulate the hue , saturation , and brightness of selected areas on a shaded relief map .
By using multiple adjustment layers that build upon one another , complimentary illumination and shadow colors can be made gradually more intense at higher elevations to suggest alpenglow ( Figure 11 ) .
Conversely , substituting gray - blue for dark gray in upper elevation shadows diminishes the visual weight of the entire map ( a good thing when additional information needs to be added ) without degrading the topographic form ( Patterson , 2001 ) .
Transparent pastel colors are preferred .
When choosing a palette to depict illuminated relief ( as well as other map elements ) , the NPS seeks fault - tolerant colors that can withstand the vagaries of offset printing , conversion between CMYK and RGB color modes , and screen viewing on multiple computer platforms .
Figure 11 .
Illuminated relief : Mt. Hood , Oregon .
Warm illumination and cool shadow tones strengthen the sense of three dimensionality in the topography despite the presence of prominent snow and forest textures .
Outside land muting
Just as the natural and cultural worlds co-exist , so too must park and non-park lands on realistically designed NPS maps .
Differentiating these areas by using figure - ground contrast is a simple matter of applying lightening or desaturation to non-park lands with an adjustment layer in Photoshop ( Figure 12 ) .
Using a transparent green boundary ribbon accentuates the boundary .
More problematic , many National Parks are surrounded by , or contain within their boundaries , an intricate quilt of public and private lands and administrative zones , such as wilderness areas , that need to be mapped .
Depicting additional property ownership on a realistic map is a challenge , which sometimes cannot be resolved satisfactorily .
The flat colors usually used to represent property holdings conflict with shaded relief and land cover textures shown below .
However , providing that the quantity and complexity of property ownership is not overwhelming , using a combination of color - coordinated lines , transparent boundary ribbons , and labels is the least damaging method for depicting property and realistic landscapes together .

With the long - awaited Patraeus White House report on progress in Iraq due in two weeks , Gen. David Patraeus gave new meaning to the expression , " There are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies , and statistics , " when he :
... told the Australian that there had been a 75 percent reduction in religious and ethnic killing since last year
You read something like that and ask yourself , how can that be ?
You remember the more than 50 Iraqis killed at a religious festival the other day , the 500 Yazidis killed two weeks ago , the tortured victims of death squads found throughout Iraq every day and you ask yourself , how can there be a 75 % reduction in killings in Iraq ?
Well , it 's easy .
You just do n't count the bodies .
Of course the Bush administration has never made any meaningful effort to track civilian fatalities in Iraq , but as hard as they try to ignore it , the killings continue and the bodies pile up .
So where did Gen .
Petraeus come up with his number ?
In all of 2006 , there were 16,564 reported ( emphasis on reported ) civilian deaths , and in the first eight months of 2007 , there has been 14,732 deaths .
So , civilian deaths are down about 11 % ... but there are four months left in the year .
Or was Gen. Petraeus comparing the same time periods from last year and this year ?
If that 's the case , in the first 8 months of 2006 , there were 8,490 civilian deaths versus the 14,732 in the first 8 months of 2007 , which is an increase of nearly 75 % .
Is Gen. Petraeus using Karl Rove 's math ?
When the White House was asked about this , Tony Snow said :
MR. SNOW : ... The other thing is , how one measures overall violence , it would be interesting to see what that metric is .
General Petraeus clearly has a different view of that .
I would defer to him on that .
You see , proving that Bush 's surge is working is easy .
Announce that those once vital benchmarks are no longer operative , pretend that the training of Iraqi security forces is right on track , disregard the 723 U.S. troops who have died since the surge began .
And of course , ignore the thousands and thousands of Iraqis who have died .
Why change course now ?
And in two weeks , Gen .
Petraeus will appear before Congress and swear that the surge is working and the administration will ask for another $ 200 billion to , " finish what we started . "
The only question left is , will the Democratic leadership continue to support the administration or will they choose to finally support the troops ?
Instead of listening to George Bush 's man on the ground , perhaps they should listen to Spc. Yvenson Tertulien :
I do n't see any progress .
Just us getting killed .
I do n't want to be here anymore .
He sounds a whole lot more honest , does n't he ?

Note :
This story is no longer available at infinity plus .
The day was not far past when German scholars had been forced to go to Leyden , Paris , Cambridge , Padua , even Vienna — when the German universities had been strongholds of obscurantism , dogmatic theology , and sterile pedantry .
But now the tide was suddenly setting in from the other direction .
Scholars from all over the world were coming to Berlin , Heidelberg , Leipzig , Halle , Munich , Bonn , and Göttingen .
Even in far - away America the whole system of higher education was being remodeled upon German plans .
Harvard was borrowing copiously from Berlin ; in the Johns Hopkins Medical School a new Heidelberg was arising .
In every other field of civilized activity the Germans were going ahead just as rapidly .
The inventions and discoveries of their scientists were being applied with an ingenuity and a dispatch that no other nation could match ; they were swiftly getting a virtual monopoly of all those forms of industry which depended upon scientific exactness , — for example , the manufacture of drugs , dye - stuffs , and optical goods .
And at the same time they were making equal , if not actually superior , progress in the grosser departments of trade .
Their two great steamship corporations , the one founded back in 1847 and the other ten years later , were taking on new life and acquiring huge fleets of freight and passenger ships — fleets soon to be much larger , in fact , than any that even England could show .
Their tramp steamers , more numerous every year , were trading to all the ports of the world .
German drummers were everywhere , eager to make terms , speaking all languages .
The first German colonies had been acquired in the middle eighties ; the setting up of new ones now went on apace ; advances were made into Africa and Oceania ; a landing on the mainland of Asia was to follow in 1897 .
And the German navy , so long a mere paper power , was soon to be converted into a thing of authentic steel .
So in the arts .
Wagner was dead , but German music still lived in Johannes Brahms , now the acknowledged tone - master of the world , perhaps the true successor of Beethoven and Bach .
Nor was he a solitary figure .
A youngster named Richard Strauss , the son of a Munich horn - player , was fast coming to fame ; Mahler , Humperdink , and other lesser men were carrying on the glorious German tradition ; German conductors and teachers were in high demand ; German opera , after years of struggle , was at last breaking into New York , London , even Paris .
And in literature Germany was entering upon the most productive period since the golden age of Goethe and Schiller .
The German drama , before any other , began to show the influence of the revolutionary Ibsen , himself a resident of Germany , and more German in blood than Norwegian .
Sudermann and Hauptmann , the twin giants , were at the threshold of their parallel careers ; Lilienkron , Hartleben , and Bierbaum were about to put new life into the German lyric ; a new school of German storytellers was arising .
And Munich , to make an end , was beginning to offer rivalry to Paris in painting , and bringing in students from afar .
On all sides there was this vast enrichment of the national consciousness , this brilliant shining forth of the national spirit , this feeling of new and superabundant efficiency , this increase of pride , achievement , and assurance .
III
The thing to be noted here is that the progress I have been describing was initiated and carried on , not by the old aristocracy of the barrack and the court , but by a new aristocracy of the laboratory , the study , and the shop .
The Junkertum , though it was still to do good service as a hobgoblin , had long since ceased to dominate the state , and its ideals had gone the way of its power .
Bismarck was the last of its great gladiators — and its first deserter .
Far back in the seventies , perhaps even in the sixties , he had seen the signs of its impending collapse , and thereafter he had been gradually metamorphosed into an exponent of the new order .
Did he wage a war upon the Catholic Church ?
Then it was because he saw all organized and autonomous religion , with its tenacity to established ideas and its hostility to reforms from without , as a conspiracy against that free experimentation which alone makes for human progress .
Did he do valiant battle with the Socialists , the Liberals , the whole tribe of political phrasemongers and tub - thumpers ?
Then it was because he knew how puerile and how futile were the cure - alls preached by these quacks — how much all political advancement was a matter of careful trial and stage - management , and how little it was a matter of principles and shibboleths .
And did he , in the end , definitely turn his back upon the axioms of his youth , and take his stand for the utmost dissemination of opportunity , the true democratization of talent ?
Then it was because he had seen feudalism gasp out its last breath when federalism was born at Versailles , and was convinced that it was dead to rise no more .

E. Lawrence Barcella , Mr. Hsu ’s lawyer , said that Mr. Hsu was getting a California lawyer to represent him before the state attorney general .
Mr. Barcella declined to comment on where Mr. Hsu was , or on the status of any bench warrants issued against him in that state .
“ On that matter , he will be represented by California counsel , ” Mr. Barcella said .
Investigators believe that after Mr. Hsu skipped his court appearance in 1992 , he went to his native Hong Kong and then continued working in the garment trade .
At some point , Mr. Hsu , a naturalized American citizen , returned to New York and in 2003 made the first of what became hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to Democratic campaigns around the nation .
People who met him said they knew only that he ran an apparel business .
Efforts to learn more about his trade hit dead - ends yesterday .
Visits to companies at addresses listed by Mr. Hsu on campaign finance records provided little information .
There were no offices in buildings in New York ’s garment district whose addresses were given for businesses with names like Components Ltd. , Cool Planets , Next Components , Coopgors Ltd. , NBT and Because Men ’s clothing — all listed by Mr. Hsu in federal filings at different times .
At a new loft - style residential condominium in SoHo that was also listed as an address for one of his companies , an employee there said that he had never seen or heard of Mr. Hsu .
Another company was listed at a condo that Mr. Hsu had sublet in an elegant residential tower in Midtown Manhattan just off Fifth Avenue , but an employee there said Mr. Hsu moved out two years ago , after having lived there for five years .
The employee , who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about residents , said he recalled that Mr. Hsu had received a lot of mail from the Democratic Party .
Mr. Kerrey said he was introduced to Mr. Hsu about two years ago , and shortly thereafter Mr. Hsu joined the board of governors at the Eugene Lang College for liberal arts at the New School .
He joined the university ’s board of trustees last July .
“ So much of the university is about the immigrant culture , and I liked his personal story , coming from China , and he had an interest in fashion as well , ” Mr. Kerrey said .
“ It all intrigued me . ”
He said that the university did not do background checks of prospective trustees , and that he saw no reason to ask Mr. Hsu to resign from its board .
Jamie Kelly 's job title is national marketing programs manager .
That really means " employee marketing training manager , " she explains , as if that clarifies her role to adults , much less kids .
The way Ms. Kelly 's 6 - year - old daughter sees it , her mother travels to a big building , sits in her office and fools around at a computer .
Is that inaccurate ?
" No , not really , " says Ms. Kelly .
On the other hand , it makes her ponder , " What do I do all day ? "
If you 're teetering on the edge of a midlife crisis , you may want to forgo asking the kids what they think you do for a living .
Their answers might be cute -- except for the fact that they 're accurate .
The vast majority of information - age workers actually do spend their days talking on the phone and staring at a screen .
They may pace , but there 's no edge - of - your - seat action .
So , consider it from the kids ' perspective .
They might spend all day talking and typing on computers but , unlike us , they do n't get paid a nickel for it .
" One of the problems affluent , middle - class parents have is explaining to their kids the value of what they do , as opposed to passing along a sense of entitlement , " says Stephanie Coontz , professor of history and family studies at the Evergreen State College .
At least in the Industrial Age , " you produced products that people could understand , " she says .
Because kids ' impressions are n't wrong , technically , it can cause a little introspection .
George Reinhart is the director of associate service for New England at the Conference Board , a business - research and peer - networking organization .
That means he sells information and , like any salesman , makes lots of phone calls , not all of which go as planned .
It also means , as his 14 - year - old told him so succinctly two years ago , " You 're always rejected and you always have to apologize , " he recalls .
" You could take away from that , God , what a loser you are .
But I do n't think she meant it that way -- at least I hope she did n't mean it that way . "
At a time when few documents are paper , the ephemera of our work product can be mystifying to more than just our children .
" I 'm shocked every day that I get paid to do the stuff that I do because I can't even describe it , " says Steven Keith , a hard - working director of interactive communications at what , after much discussion , appears to be more or less an interactive advertising agency .
" My dad was an ironworker , " he says , speaking volumes in a single word .
Mr. Keith explained to his boys that his job is to " make money " for food and shelter .
So , when they drove four hours last year to visit Washington 's Bureau of Engraving and Printing , his son noted , " That 's why you 're so grumpy -- because you have to drive all this way to work . "
John McGuire remembers his father 's identifying Air Force uniform at home .
He has his own type of uniform as a regional vice president of sales for a large networking company , which allows him to work from home .
" They just see me hanging around in my shorts and talking on the phone , " he says .
Job specialization means that even when the kids do know what your company does , they do n't get your role in it .
That 's why parents have to concede to their kids ' questions with phrases like , " Not me personally but my company . "
Dean Souleles explained to his 15 - year - old son that his company builds hospital - management software .
No , he does n't write it himself , but he does manage people who do .
" So what do you do ? " his son still asked .
Not something as cool as the boy once thought .
A few years ago , Mr. Souleles became president of the company 's enterprise division .
Then nine , his son asked if he worked with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock .
" It would be a lot more fun to be able to talk about that , " says Mr. Souleles .
His job is hard to glamorize : " I spend most of my day trying to get people to do what they ought to be doing without me having to tell them they ought to be doing it . "
Nina Lawrence , publisher of W fashion magazine , brings her kindergartner " business traveler guilt gifts " such as key rings and tiny statues .
That 's why her boy has told people that " she works at the Eiffel Tower . "
We should n't feel bad .
Chelsea Clinton reportedly used to describe her father , the former Commander in Chief this way : " He gives speeches , drinks coffee , and talks on the telephone . "
Yo - Yo Ma 's son thought his father worked at the airport because the world - renowned cellist was always rushing to one .
Gary Grote 's six - year - old daughter has figured out the skills required for a bank vice president of corporate lending : typing , talking and going to lunch a lot .
Mr. Grote can't argue with that .
" When you boil it down , that 's pretty much the deal , " he says .
He , too , could understand his father 's job , grain - elevator owner , easier than his kids can understand his .
" You could see and touch the grain moving through the elevator , " he says .
" I 've worked at the bank for 15 years .
It 's been 14 years since I touched a bit of currency other than getting it out of my own account . "

BBC News , Sydney
After Sydney hosted the 2000 Olympics , a compelling case could be made for holding the games in the city every four years , such was the panache and energy which pulsated through its staging .
After Apec , most Sydneysiders are saying " Never again " .
Snipers were among the thousands of security officers deployed
Like many , he is incensed by what he regards as the needlessly aggressive and restrictive policing , which carried a heftier security price tag than the 16 - day - long Olympics and led to the construction of the 5 km ( three mile ) " great wall of Sydney " .
" I 'm so embarrassed and annoyed .
Where was the sense of proportion ?
We replaced Olympic volunteers with riot squads , " he says .
" Somebody in the security operation got very carried away with their own self - importance , and nobody in the state or federal government counterbalanced them .
" It was totally and utterly disproportionate . "
' Iron fist '
Consider the experience of Greg McLeay , a 52 - year - old accountant and father of three .
On Friday , with his 11 - year - old son looking on , he was arrested by the police in the central business district .
Thrown in jail under special Apec powers which allowed the police to hold people without bail , he was strip - searched and forced to spend the night locked up with a drug addict .
His offence ?
Crossing the road incorrectly during Apec near a cordoned - off area .
From demonstrations of its new high - powered water cannon to night - time exercises involving riot police , the New South Wales police were determined to show they were ready for large - scale protests with the possibility of turning violent .
But had they war - gamed against the wrong kind of protests ?
They had geared up for so much trouble , it almost became a self - fulfilling prophecy
Christopher Brown
Similarly , they had cleared hundreds of prison cells , in anticipation of filling them with protesters .
In the end , there were 17 arrests .
Two police officers were injured - one was hit by a dart .
At the tail - end of the protest on Saturday , many marchers and journalists were mystified by the appearance of riot squads , backed up with the ominous presence of the water cannon .
As the Sun -Herald noted : " Police ruled Sydney 's streets with an iron fist . "
But the paper 's headline " Police Rule " could just as easily have read " Overkill " .
" They had geared up for so much trouble , it almost became a self - fulfilling prophecy , " says Christopher Brown .
Police under fire
For many Sydneysiders , comedians from the already popular The Chasers War on Everything have become folk heroes - they managed to breach the million - dollar security set - up with a few shiny black hire cars , some wrap - around sunglasses , a few fake passes , a colour printer and a handful of bonnet - mounted Canadian and Australian flags .
Almost 5,000 New South Wales police officers , 1,500 defence personnel , 450 federal police , teams of sharp - shooters , patrol boats zipping across the harbour , Black Helicopters swooping above - all upstaged by 11 members of a TV comedy show .
Police were determined to show they were ready for large - scale protests
There was the fumbling handling of the Mohamed Haneef case , which involved an Indian doctor arrested and then released over the failed car bomb attacks in London and Glasgow .
The Australian Federal Police were labelled the " Keystone Cops " , by no less a figure that the state premier of Queensland .
Similarly , this is not the first time that the authorities have been criticised for over - zealous policing .
Ahead of the Ashes tour by the England cricket team , Morris Iemma wrote to the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair asking him to identify known hooligans travelling with the " Barmy Army " .
Then there were the decisions to ban the Barmy Army 's trumpeter and ban Mexican waves - all of which seemed like the over - enforcement of the " Killjoy Act " .
Prime Minister John Howard , a proud Sydneysider himself , may pay a political price for Apec , even though many of the security arrangements were put in place by the Labor - controlled New South Wales state government .
Trailing badly in the polls , he hoped the summit would boost him ahead of the upcoming federal election .
With the signing of the Sydney Declaration , a rather vague statement on cutting greenhouse emissions , improving energy intensity and increasing forestation , John Howard has gained some much - needed green credentials - even if environmentalists claim the statement is largely worthless because its targets are non-binding .
But he has also done a very dangerous thing : hosted and been the figurehead of a summit which was deeply unpopular with the residents of Australia 's largest city , where his own increasingly marginal constituency resides .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
The editor of a Baghdad weekly newspaper was murdered at the weekend , Iraq ’s Journalistic Freedoms Observatory said on Tuesday .
The Iraqi non-governmental organization said Shehab Mohammed al - Hiti , a Sunni Arab editor of the al - Youm newspaper , was last seen leaving his home in the western Baghdad neighborhood of Jamiaa on Saturday .
He was heading for the newspaper ’s office in the centre of the capital .
Iraqi security forces found his body later that day in the northern Baghdad district of Ur , which is a Shi’ite neighborhood .
In a statement the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory did not say how he had been killed .
Many journalists in Iraq have faced threats from Sunni Arab militants and Shi’ite militias .
Others have been killed by U.S. forces while reporting in the country .
The New - York based Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the weekend killing .
“ Journalists continue to be killed in Iraq at an alarming rate , underscoring the risks of practicing what has become one of the deadliest professions in the country , ” CPJ executive director Joel Simon said in a statement .
At least 122 journalists and 41 media support staff have been killed in Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 , the CPJ says .
About 85 percent of those killed were Iraqis .
Inexperienced at building satellites with optical lenses , Boeing started missing deadlines and exceeding cost estimates almost immediately .
By the time the Pentagon took the program away from Boeing in 2005 , it was five years behind schedule and had cost $ 10 billion , including $ 4 billion in cost overruns .
For contractors , this sort of failure is seldom punished — it ’s often rewarded .
Many contracts are “ cost plus , ” meaning there will be no penalty if a contractor wildly exceeds the initial projection .
Better still , a contractor can break something , then bid for the job of putting it back together .
When the N.S.A. wanted to create another program , ExecuteLocus , to replace Science Applications International ’s failed Trailblazer , it needed a contractor to build it .
Who got the job ?
Science Applications .
The orthodoxy of privatization — that it ’s the government that ’s mired by inefficiency and a lack of competition — has been turned on its head in the intelligence industry .
However patriotic , contractors must ultimately answer to their shareholders and the bottom line .
There ’s more than one way to read Lockheed Martin ’s recent advertising slogan : “ We never forget who we ’re working for . ”
It ’s not just the money that flows out the door , either : it ’s also the people , as the companies offer hefty raises to government employees who join their ranks .
A recent report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found that “ contractors recruit our own employees , already cleared and trained at government expense , and then ‘ lease ’ them back to us at considerably greater expense . ”
This process — called “ bidding back ” — has created a brain drain .
Two - thirds of the Department of Homeland Security ’s senior officials and experts have departed for private industry .
Michael Hayden , the C.I.A. director , worries that his agency has become “ a farm team for these contractors . ”
The revolving door helps firms score more contracts .
Federal law prohibits executive branch officials from lobbying former colleagues after leaving public office — but just for the first year .
Can a government acquisitions officer who might someday like a job at a contractor really evaluate the contractor ’s bid objectively ?
William Black Jr. left the National Security Agency in 1997 , after a 38 - year career , to become a vice president at Science Applications .
He returned to the agency as deputy director in 2000 , and shortly thereafter the Trailblazer contract was awarded to his former employer .
Nothing illegal here , but is there not at least the appearance of a conflict of interest ?
The good news is that Congress seems to have finally caught on to the scale of the problem .
The intelligence authorization bill that passed the House last month included an amendment that would require the director of national intelligence to submit a report on the functions performed by contractors , the ways contracts are vetted , and the savings associated with outsourcing .
The Senate Intelligence Committee explicitly chided the spy agencies earlier this month for “ increasing reliance on contractors . ”
In response , the C.I.A. announced that it would pare the number of contractors by 10 percent .
More From the “ Economic Naturalist ” Robert Frank
We recently posted a series of excerpts from The Economic Naturalist , a new book by the Cornell economist Robert Frank ( who has another new book out this week , Falling Behind , a brief treatise on income inequality ) .
Because the Economic Naturalist excerpts were well received and vigorously debated , we asked Frank if he would reply to some of the feedback .
Kindly , he has obliged :
Guest Blog : Robert H. Frank
When I describe my “ economic naturalist ” writing assignment to students , I stress that it is not important that the answers to the questions they pose be correct beyond doubt .
Far more important is that the questions themselves be interesting and the proposed answers economically plausible .
The learning stimulated by this assignment stems less , I think , from the writing of the papers themselves than from the animated discussions provoked by the questions .
I was therefore extremely encouraged by the lively reader responses to the examples from The Economic Naturalist on this blog recently .
I was encouraged , too , that a Google search a few days after the post ran turned up over 100 other web sites that had linked to it .
To my eye , that ’s the real beauty of the writing assignment :
Once students manage to pose an interesting question , they immediately want to discuss it with others .
And in the process , they find endless opportunities to refine their thinking about what a sensible answer might look like .
In short , they learn a lot from these conversations , just as I did from reading your comments .
Such exchanges also provide valuable opportunities to push back , to probe the power of opposing views .
So I am pleased to take advantage of an invitation to respond to some of the criticisms of my students ’ explanations .
McMansions for Retirees : Several respondents objected that the phenomenon to be explained – that retirees are increasingly buying large houses close to home rather than smaller condominiums in the Sun Belt – was a statistical artifact .
In the book , I cited studies purporting to confirm the trend in question , but I ’m quick to concede that the practice may not be widespread in many areas .
It does seem clear , however , that supply and demand in the retirees ’ housing market have shifted in precisely the way my student Tobin Schilke described .
Because the number of births per adult American woman has remained roughly the same for several decades , the number of children is no greater now than in the past .
Yet because of the secular rise in divorce and remarriage , each child now has more grandparents than in the past ( on the plausible assumption that we count the parents of step - parents as grandparents ) .
The upshot is that the demand for visits by grandchildren has increased relative to the supply of such visits .
If we grant Mr. Schilke ’s plausible assumption that having a large , conveniently located house makes visits more likely , it follows that retirees are more likely to demand such houses .
Of course , there may have been other offsetting changes in the retirees ’ housing market .
Rising energy costs , for example , may have reduced the demand for large houses .
But that would n’t challenge Mr. Shilke ’s interesting observations about how demographic changes appear to have altered the demand for grandchild visits .
Square Milk Containers : Regarding the proposed explanation that milk containers have square cross-sections in order to minimize the amount of costly shelf space they occupy in refrigerated storage units ( in contrast to the cylindrical containers of soft drinks , which are typically stored on unrefrigerated shelves ) , several respondents pointed out that containers with square cross-sections could not contain the pressurized contents of carbonated soft drinks unless their walls were so thick as to make them prohibitively costly .
It ’s a fair point .
But a milk container of given volume could also be produced at lower cost if it were cylindrical in cross-section rather than square .
Relative to a container with square cross-section , however , a cylindrical design would definitely increase the cost of storing milk on refrigerated shelves .
So it seems fair to conclude that the cross-section of milk containers is dictated at least in part by a desire to minimize the cost of refrigerated storage .
Premium Prices for Black MacBooks :
When its newly introduced black iPods quickly sold out in 2005 , Apple discovered that customers would be willing to pay premium prices for a machine in a previously unavailable color .
So when it brought out its new MacBook models the next year , it posted a higher price for the black version and had no difficulty selling them .
Many respondents apparently mistook me to be saying that Apple was somehow exploiting its customers by charging the premium .
But the central point of the example was exactly the contrary .
Whenever a seller produces under economies of scale , it is always possible to create additional economic surplus for all parties - buyers and seller alike – by using what I call the “ hurdle ” method of price discrimination .
The basic idea is that the seller offers a discount only to buyers who are willing to jump some sort of hurdle , such as mailing in a rebate coupon or settling for a machine in a less desired color .
These discounts increase the number of units sold , in the process reducing the average production cost per unit .
The resulting cost savings often make it possible for even buyers who pay full list price to end up paying less than they would have if the product were sold to the same price to everyone .
Although some complain that it is unfair to charge some buyers more than others for essentially the same product , in The Economic Naturalist I argue that Apple ’s pricing scheme actually appears to mete out a certain rough economic justice .
This will be true if , as appears plausible , the buyers who are willing to pay extra for the black machines are also the ones who value the company ’s innovative design features most highly .
After all , somebody has to pay for Apple ’s prodigious research and development costs .
Why should n’t these costs fall more heavily on those consumers who care most about cutting edge design ?
Gas Caps on the Right and Left Side of Cars :
In response to her question about why fuel filler doors are sometimes on the left , sometimes on the right ( causing confusion for rental car drivers ) , my student Patty Yu argued that if filler doors were all on the same side ( say , the driver ’s side ) , lines at the gas pumps would be much longer during peak periods .
Numerous respondents suggested other possible reasons for filler door placement .
One pointed out , for example , that manufacturers tend to put the filler door on the side opposite the muffler and tail pipe , perhaps to minimize the odds of gasoline spilling onto a hot pipe during an accident .
Click and Clack discussed this hypothesis on Car Talk recently , noting that , although the correlation exists , it is far from perfect .
They also mentioned a variant of another respondent ’s observation that European manufacturers tend to put the filler door on the passenger ’s side , perhaps to minimize the danger to a driver who runs out of gas and must add fuel to his tank while stopped at the side of a highway .
Their variant was that manufacturers in countries that drive on the right tend to put filler doors on the passenger ’s side , thereby to keep them farther away from shearing forces in head - on collisions .
And indeed , Japanese cars do tend to have their filler doors on the left ( drivers in Japan , like those in the U.K. and Australia , drive on the left side of the road ) .
Here again , though , there are many exceptions .
( My Miata ’s filler door is on the left , but my son ’s Subaru ’s is on the right . )
By far the most common objection to Ms. Yu ’s explanation was that it seemed to presume a conscious attempt on the part of manufacturers to coordinate their fuel - filler door placements – something for which there is no evidence .
It is this objection that I find most interesting from a methodological perspective .
Suppose manufacturers had not , in fact , coordinated their efforts in an explicit attempt to minimize the queues at gas pumps .
Would that make Ms. Yu ’s explanation any less plausible ?
If one views product design features in an evolutionary perspective , the answer is clearly no .
Darwinians argue that useful features evolve from random mutations .
The eye , for example , developed from a sequence of random mutations because light - sensitive organisms were better able to locate valued objects and avoid harmful ones .
The whole point of the theory is to explain how eyes came to exist without anyone having consciously planned them .
A similar point applies to evolutionary explanations in economics .
If all manufacturers had happened to place fuel filler doors on , say , the left side of the car , one consequence would have been long gas lines during peak hours , because drivers in most countries would pull up on the right side of the pump .
And in that case , manufacturers would have had a problem worth addressing .
Ms. Yu ’s explanation thus helps explain why the observed distribution of filler door placements is evolutionarily stable .
Evolution , as Richard Dawkins once observed , is less aptly described as “ the survival of the fittest ” than as “ the survival of the stable . ”
In Summary :
In telling my students that their answers do n’t have to be the final word , I ’m not saying that it ’s not a good thing to be right .
Rather , my point is that students are more likely to engage with our subject if we demonstrate that it can stimulate them to think about the world in interesting new ways .
I ’ll mention another piece of evidence that the questions they pose meet that test with flying colors .
Several hours after I had discussed a couple of examples from The Economic Naturalist in a brief interview on NPR earlier this week ( “ Econo - reasoning behind everyday things , ” Marketplace Morning Report ) a listener copied me on this e-mail in which he posed a long list of economic naturalist questions of his own .
Some examples :

It is an agonising procedure now considered too cruel to inflict on animals .
But human branding has become the latest twisted fashion trend for young professionals who regard straightforward tattoos and piercings as passe .
They happily pay up to £ 70 to have red - hot metal brands or cauterising pens , which burn at more than 1,000C , permanently scar their skin with a design .
The technique , which was once a brutal punishment for violent criminals and army deserters , carries the risk of nerve damage and infection .
But while animal welfare legislation has outlawed the hot branding of livestock , there is nothing to stop humans voluntarily having their skin burnt as a fashion statement .
Graham Martin , who offers branding at his Holier Than Thou studio in Manchester , said it was becoming popular with professionals .
The number of people asking him for the procedure has risen from just one a year in 2002 to more than one a week including requests from teachers , nurses and policemen .
Mr Martin , who is also president of the Tattoo and Piercing Industry association , said : " We have had people as young as 16 ask for a branding .
" We have turned them away because we would not tattoo anyone under the age of 18 .
But there is no legislation banning this . "
Insurance clerk Paul Doling , from Eastbourne , East Sussex , had eight circles in two lines burnt onto his forearm , which took an hour to complete .
The 29 - year - old said : " It was an incredible experience .
There was smoke coming out of my arm and my burnt flesh smelled like a cross between chicken and bacon .
" A couple of friends had it done and I decided to go for it myself .
" It 's about pushing yourself and seeing how much you can take .
In the end the adrenaline rush masked the pain .
" Tattoos and piercings have become so common and mainstream now that people are looking for something different , which is why they are turning to branding . '
Dave Wiper of the Modern Savage tattoo studio in Wakefield , West Yorkshire , said there has been huge increase in the number of people wanting to have a design permanently seared into their flesh .
On once occasion he branded a Muslim man who wanted a tattoo but cannot introduce ink to the body because of his religion .
Many of those who have their skin branded film the ordeal and post the footage video website YouTube .
A spokeswoman from the Health and Safety Executive said the body could not ban people from branding themselves if that is what they wanted to do , but had published a leaflet with regulations for to try to reduce the risks .
Human branding was introduced as a punishment in England during the middle ages .
By the 16th century gypsies were marked with a large V for vagabond on their breast , and street brawlers with F for fraymaker .
But the practice was banned in the mid 1850s because it was regarded as inhumane .
However , it continued to be used in other countries and is still used today in Iraq as a form of torture .
" Who are the real terrorists in the Middle East ?
What exactly is being defended ?
Is it the citizens of Israel or the nature of the Israeli state ? "
The Independent UK ,
READ IT ,
the bitter answer
" What is Israel defending ? "
It tries to portray this horror as necessary for its self - defence .
Israel is a state which , instead of defending its citizens , puts all of them , Jews as well as non-Jews , in danger .
Israel 's statehood is based on an unjust ideology which causes indignity and suffering for those who are classified as non-Jewish by either a religious or ethnic test .
Israel fosters an image of victimhood .
Provoking violence , consciously or unconsciously , against which one must defend oneself is a key feature of the victim - mentality .
endorsing a Palestinian state implicitly endorses the ideology behind a Jewish one .
The very creation of Israel required an act of terror .
This action was carefully planned .
Without it , NO STATE WITH A JEWISH MAJORITY AND CHARACTER would have been possible .
the Israeli state must hide the core problem , by nourishing a victim mentality among Israeli Jews .
Israel must breed conditions for violence .
Whenever prospects of violence against it subside , Israel must do its utmost to regenerate them :
Israel 's successful campaign to silence criticism of its initial and continuing dispossession of the indigenous Palestinians leaves the latter no option but to resort to violent resistance .
The truth is that there never could have been a partition of Palestine by ethically acceptable means .
Israel was created through terror and it needs terror to cover - up its core immorality .
****** Whenever there is a glimmer of stability , the state orders a targeted assassination , such as that in Sidon which preceded the current Lebanon crisis ,******
The more we silence its voice , the more violently actuality is sure to speak .
In Hebrew , the word elem ( a stunned silence resulting from oppression or shock ) is etymologically linked to the word almut ( violence ) .
Silence about the immoral core of Israeli statehood makes us all complicit in breeding the terrorism that threatens a catastrophe which could tear the world apart .
One thing that I have been wanting to do for a while now is create a list of the world ’s probloggers .
If you have made your living online through producing content for a blog , I want to hear about it , and add you to the list I am creating .
The list will be hosted on the Problogger page of the Million Dollar Wiki .
I bought a page for this purpose .
I think it will be a fun project to take on , and other than the list of Probloggers and their sites , I hope to list some great blogging resources for people wanting to get to the point in their blogging career to join the list .
So if you would like to be added to the list , please comment on this post , or head on over to the contact page , and let me know your name , your blog URL , and where you are in the world .
Protesters to confront GOP candidates with ' cost of war ' Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 5 , 2007
Print This Email This
While the top Republican presidential candidates have criticized President Bush 's approach to the war in some instances , all the GOP frontrunners maintain support for the war in Iraq and the president 's troop surge .
Sen .
John McCain , whose campaign has struggled lately , plans to make the war a key part of his appeal to voters at Wednesday 's GOP debate , reminding viewers that he has called for more troops in Iraq since 2003 .
When they gather in New Hampshire Wednesday night , Republicans searching for Bush 's replacement will be confronted by antiwar activists who will offer alternatives for the $ 720 million they say is being spent daily in Iraq .
( In the time it took to read the previous sentences , $ 125,000 was spent on the war , according to the activists ' estimates . )
" I 'm convinced that many Republicans and maybe even most Republicans are going to share some of those concerns that we 've got " Arnie Alpert , an organizer with American Friends Service Committee , told RAW STORY in an interview .
" I 'm not going to pick a fight , but I 'm bringing some information that might resonate with them . "
Alpert said activists will display five large banners outside the debate site illustrating how much the money being spent on the war could pay for domestically .
The group has organized similar protests at Republican and Democratic debates in New Hampshire this year .
" They 're still spending $ 720 million a day at war , so we obviously want that to change , so that 's what our message is , " Alpert said of the group 's " nonpartisan " decision to target Democrats as well as Republicans .
The protesters are being organized with the help of New Hampshire Peace Action as an extension of the AFSC's " Cost of War " advocacy project .
On its Web site , the group says $ 720 million would pay salaries for 12,478 new teachers , or it could fund 34,904 four - year college scholarships or it could retrofit more than 1.2 million homes to use renewable energy .
Protesters will be displaying large signs similar to the graphics displayed on the site .
A Quaker organization , AFSC arrived at its estimate of the war 's daily cost based on calculations from economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes .
The estimate factors in money approved by Congress to directly fund the war along with estimates of its long - term costs , such as interest on the national debt and healthcare for returning veterans .
The suspect is said to be of European origin , and aged 35 to 40
The man appears in about 200 images depicting the abuse of 12 boys , which police said were taken in Vietnam and Cambodia , possibly in 2002 and 2003 .
The pictures had been digitally altered but police computer specialists have produced identifiable images .
Interpol says the man is a danger to children while he remains at large .
Interpol chief Ronald Noble said : " We have tried all other means to identify and to bring him to justice .
" We are now convinced that without the public 's help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse young children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens . "
Image database
The first pictures of the man were found three years ago in Germany , Interpol said .
The pictures had been manipulated to disguise the man 's face with a swirl pattern , but computer specialists at Germany 's federal police agency , the BKA , worked with Interpol 's human trafficking team to produce identifiable images .
They show a man with slightly receding dark hair , aged 35 to 40 years old .
Despite extensive efforts through Interpol 's network of 186 member states his identity remains unknown .
Interpol maintains a database of 520,000 images of child sex abuse submitted by 36 member states .
Using sophisticated software , investigators have identified and rescued nearly 600 victims from 31 countries .
The senators ’ comments , along with those of other members of Congress briefed on the program , suggested that they considered the eavesdropping and data mining so closely tied that they were part of a single program .
Both activities , which ordinarily require warrants , were started without court approval as the Bush administration intensified counterterrorism efforts soon after the Sept. 11 attacks .
A half - dozen officials and former officials interviewed for this article would speak only on the condition of anonymity , in part because unauthorized disclosures about the classified program are already the subject of a criminal investigation .
Some of the officials said the 2004 dispute involved other issues in addition to the data mining , but would not provide details .
They would not say whether the differences were over how the databases were searched or how the resulting information was used .
Nor would they explain what modifications to the surveillance program President Bush authorized to head off the threatened resignations by Justice Department officials .
An agency spokesman declined to comment on the data mining issue but referred a reporter to a statement issued earlier that Mr. Gonzales had testified truthfully .
The Justice Department announced in January that eavesdropping without warrants under the Terrorist Surveillance Program had been halted , and that a special intelligence court was again overseeing the wiretapping .
The N.S.A. , the nation ’s largest intelligence agency , generally eavesdrops on communications in foreign countries .
Since the 1978 passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , known as FISA , any eavesdropping to gather intelligence on American soil has required a warrant from the special court .
In addition , court approval is required for the N.S.A. to search the databases of telephone calls or e-mail records , usually compiled by American phone and Internet companies and including phone numbers or e-mail addresses , as well as dates , times and duration of calls and messages .
Sometimes called metadata , such databases do not include the content of the calls and e-mail messages — the actual words spoken or written .
Government examination of the records , which allows intelligence analysts to trace relationships between callers and identify possible terrorist cells , is considered less intrusive than actual eavesdropping .
But the N.S.A. ’s eavesdropping targeted international calls and e-mail messages of people inside the United States , while the databases contain primarily domestic records .
The conflict in 2004 appears to have turned on differing interpretations of the president ’s power to bypass the FISA law and obtain access to the records .
But , as one victim of childhood abuse warns , the people we welcome into our homes can pose a greater threat .
Sexual abuse can cause depression in later life
More than 30 years have passed since Dawn ( not her real name ) suffered the torment of sexual abuse of a man her mother welcomed into their home .
But there are times when she still feels incredibly angry and depressed about how the innocence of childhood was stolen away from her .
" For years and years I 've been trying to live with this or get over this , but then I can see an ad about abuse on the television and I feel nine years old again , " she said .
Some 43 % of 1,148 adults quizzed for a Children 's Society survey said children should not be allowed out to play with their friends until they were 14 .
However , Dawn , 44 , believes this parental fear of strangers is out of proportion compared to the real threat posed by people known and trusted .
She said : " For every child that goes missing there must be an excessive amount in care after being sexually abused .
" As a child I was safer out of my home . "
When she was taken into care she met many children who had also been abused by relatives or other people they knew .
Dawn said her own sexual abuse begun " as a young tot " .
" I do n't remember exact times , but I remember being touched in the bathroom when I was being bathed and it became our ' special secret ' , " she said .
Abuser 's threats
The abuse became increasingly horrific over more than 10 years during which she was made to have sexual intercourse with her younger brothers as well as with other people .
Recalling how her stepfather put on a different face to the rest of the world , she said : " He would volunteer to take us out , and that made him appear like a really good father , but he would take us to the woods and that 's where it would happen - it was really vile , " she said .
She believes her mother was aware , or was just " ignorant " of the abuse , but added she offered no protection .
A woman might meet a good - looking man down the pub and move into a relationship quickly with him
Dawn
Her stepfather threatened he " would kill her " if she ever told , and Dawn remained quiet .
However , when she was 13 , the subject of incest was discussed during a religious education lesson , and made Dawn realise the gravity of her own situation .
The teenager went to a police station , and her report led to her being taken into care , where she remained until she was 18 .
Her stepfather was jailed for several years .
' Strong spirit '
Despite her sad past , Dawn , who has had lots of counselling , has managed to build a life for herself and her partner in Devon .
" Fortunately and unfortunately I am a strong person and people have said to me throughout my life that I have a strong spirit you can't break , " she said .
She added : " I still harbour a lot of anger because of the injustice of it all , I still feel it has n't had a satisfactory ending . "
She now believes parents and British society generally must change their approach to child protection if progress is to be made .
" A woman might meet a good - looking man down the pub and move into a relationship quickly with him , but instead of wondering about him , she is scared about leaving her child in a park .
" I think when people have children they have to behave completely differently , and not think they can just carry on as before . "
She does not believe children are valued in UK society and people are scared to raise such issues , or criticise parents for fear of offending them .
' Assess risks '
Dawn , who decided not to have children , also believes newspaper campaigns which identify paedophiles ' addresses are unhelpful and add to the hysteria about strangers .
She believes one way forward is to be more open as a society and that children should be taught to assess risks and how to deal with them .
" As a culture we do n't mention the ' sex ' word , but I think children have got to be talked to openly and told what is inappropriate .
" They have to be told it is appropriate for a stranger to pick you up if you fall off your bike on the street , but obviously not if they then take you home . "
Dawn 's views have some backing from childcare experts , with the NSPCC confirming that it considers children to be more at risk from people they know .
Its current campaign Do n't Hide
It , featuring hard - hitting radio adverts and a website aimed at 11 - 16 - year - olds , encourages abused children to speak out about what is happening to them .
NSPCC head of child protection awareness Chris Cloke said : " NSPCC research shows that more children are sexually abused by those known to them - including parents , carers or relatives - than by strangers or those they have recently met . "
" Parents and communities can help keep children safe by putting child protection at the heart of their thinking and by reporting any concerns as early as possible . "
Dell Inc. customers who ordered its new high - end XPS M1330 notebook shortly after it launched in late June are hopping mad after the computer maker has pushed out delivery dates several times and canceled orders without notification .
A Dell executive said this weekend that the laptop is now shipping in limited quantities , but warned buyers to expect additional delays .
The M1330 , which Dell has promoted since the ultralight portable 's June 26 debut as " the world 's thinnest 13.3 - inch notebook , " was originally tagged with a ship date seven to ten days after ordering , numerous customers claimed on the Dell2 Dell Web site and blog .
That quickly changed , however , to one approximately 30 working days out -- in August , apparently -- both for those who had already ordered and for customers currently placing orders .
But as shipping status updates on the Dell site did n't change and follow - on e-mails arrived with even later delivery dates , customers began fuming .
" My delivery date was changed today ... they added another 20 days , " said Patrick J on July 13 in a posting to Dell2 Dell .
" i ordered mine the 26th june and will not get it until the 14th of august . "
" ordered a XPS M1330 on June 29th , " said another customer , identified only as Brian .
" The shipping date ( July 16th ) was modified twice ( Aug 7th and then Sept 13th !!!)
I sold my old laptop .
I 'm without a pc since two weeks .
I had to wait 5 more .
I 'm not happy . "
Other people who had placed orders reported Dell had canceled them without their approval or notice .
" On Friday the 20th I received a call from another person at Dell stating that ( all ? ) orders for XPS M1330 computers had been accidentally canceled due to invalid system configuration errors , " said Clinton Begin on July 21 . "
So what 's the deal Dell ?
Is my machine in the mail set to arrive on Monday ?
Or is it MIA ?
How can your systems be screwed up so bad ?
The left hand clearly does n't know what the right is doing . "
Also on July 20 , Lionel Menchaca , Dell 's digital media manager and the company 's regular blogger on Dell2 Dell , said M1330 notebooks had begun shipping , but that " the process to ramp production has taken a bit longer than we expected . "
He laid the blame on one of more unspecified components .
" The reality is that due to the unique nature of some features of the notebook , we 've had to work through some additional manufacturing processes . "
He also claimed then that customers placing new orders would see a ship date approximately four weeks in the future .
That set off more customers , who had been told their new ship dates were further out than four weeks from that date even though they 'd ordered weeks before .
Customer Paul Kelly on July 29 : " i ordered an m1330 on 6th july and was ok with a wait of four weeks .
got a late delivery notification on 28th july that the delivery date is now september 7th !
ok no worries , i decided to cancel the order and go for a macbook pro instead .
to my shock dell have taken the money for laptop on 27th july . "
Sunday , Alex Gruzen , a senior vice president in Dell 's consumer product group , waded in on Dell2 Dell .
Like Menchaca , Gruzen did not spell out the assembly or shipping problems with the M1330 , but painted the situation in general terms .
" What do I mean by issues ?
Things like part shortages , technical glitches , simple cosmetic issues , and other unanticipated issues that can arise when you start mass production , " Gruzen said .
" Our teams are doing everything they can to meet the estimated ship dates you were quoted at the time your order was placed .
We will contact customers on a case by case basis if their particular orders will experience further delay . "
Gruzen also acknowledged that large - scale production and shipping of the M1303 would only begin this week .
Too little , too late , buyers said in comments since Sunday , taking Dell to task for ringing up sales before systems were actually available .
" I think the question still remains as to why Dell launched the M1330 without indication of delays , " said a user tagged as charlie .
" Clearly if the problems involve production issues and large - scale production will not even occur until this coming week , this product was launched with the knowledge that there was actually no product to sell . "
" It took a month to get a Sr VP here [ at Dell2 Dell ] , how long before Michael Dell has to make amends for the situation ? " asked an unidentified user .
" We want to see head rolls , and Lionel Manchega 's [ sic ] not the one .
How about the Sr VP , Consumer Product Group ? "
" Another crap response .
No details , no apology , no acceptance of fault , " wrote someone calling himself Irate Customer .
" You are starting mass production a month after taking orders ?
Not before releasing ad after ad , rebate after rebate ?
And you expect those of us that ordered in the first weeks to do what ?
Pay full price for a product that will not likely ship for another 2 weeks ?
I do n't expect an answer to any of these questions .
But you can expect a lot more cancellations next week . "
As of Wednesday , the estimated ship date for an XPS M1330 -- which are priced starting at US $ 1,299 -- was pegged by Dell 's online ordering system as August 23 .

‘ Beta ’ Is Not an Excuse
Rory Prior , discussing Disco in his widely - linked weblog entry , “ On the Death of the HIG and the Triumph of Eye Candy Over Usability ” :
What you cry , how can it be awful , it smokes and shines and shimmers ?!
Yet those things do n’t excuse its most basic of usability failings — like an application from the 1980s designed for a Mac Plus it stubbornly wo n’t allow you to resize its application window , making browsing the list of files you ’re trying to burn excruciating .
You ca n’t even look inside a folder to check what files are present once you ’ve dragged them into the application , you have to resort to going back to the Finder . …
It ’s only a beta and I ’m sure many of these issues will be fixed and I really do n’t want to heap on these guys too much because it looks like a really promising app .
Laurie A. Duncan , in “ Dissing Disco ” at TUAW :
The glossy black - and - gray translucent theme is only interesting to look at for the first 5 seconds of the first launch .
After that I found myself staring at it and noticing how unappealing it really was .
Thinking an app ’s UI is ugly normally would n’t dissuade me from using it as long as the app performed well , but it took me a good minute to figure out how and at what point to name the disc I was about to burn , which is not a good sign .
…
Before I get flamed to high heaven , I am fully aware that Disco is currently in BETA and it ’s not a final release candidate .
Some of my gripes may be addressed in future builds .
Tom Burns , in “ Disco Sucks ” on his Sans Telos weblog :
I know that this is a beta release , and that the folks behind Disco continue to promise that there ’s more to come , but if what ’s to come is anything like what I ’ve seen so far it ’s not going to be pretty .
“ MJR ” , in a comment posted on Paul Kafasis ’s “ The Delicious Generation ” essay on Rogue Amoeba ’s Under the Microscope weblog :
You make some good points , but never mention that Disco is in Beta [ sic ] .
As in , not finished .
I ’m glad everyone has ripped apart Disco , because the criticism will only improve the final version of the app .
Notice a theme here ?
Here ’s one more quote , from William Shakespeare ’s Romeo and Juliet :
What ’s in a name ?
that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet ;
What Disco smells like to me is released .
And released software — particularly released software that is available for sale — is open for criticism .
In what way does Disco , or any other app that is labeled “ beta ” but is available for sale to the public , deserve to be cut any critical slack ?
What if it were a movie ?
Released to theaters , with money charged for admission , but the posters and advertisements have a starburst - shaped badge in the corner reading : “ Beta ” .
What ’s the argument ?
That something labeled with the magic word “ Beta ” ca n’t be criticized , or that if you do criticize it you ’re obligated to dilute everything with a big “ but of course , it ’s just a beta ” disclaimer ?
The sentiment here is that it ’s somehow unfair to developers to treat software labeled “ beta ” with the same critical eye as non -beta software .
That ’s true , in the case of actual beta software , where by “ actual beta ” I mean “ not yet released , but close ” .
Released vs. not -released is the distinction that warrants critical restraint .
Film critics do n’t write reviews of rough cuts .
Book critics do n’t review non-final manuscripts of novels .
Released software that is labeled “ beta ” is still released software , and is fair game for the same level of criticism as any released software .
You ca n’t “ semi- release ” your 1.0 just because you want it out there but are n’t yet finished .
Being semi-released is like being semi-pregnant .
It ’s worth pointing out what I ’m not talking about here :
Public betas of commercial software for which there exists a stable , official version , and for which the public beta , when finished , will be a free upgrade .
Public betas of freeware and open source ; e.g. Camino , which was in beta ( or whatever state it is that software is in when its version number is less than 1.0 ) for years before it hit 1.0 in February .
Public betas of software that is not yet for sale ; e.g. Adobe Lightroom .
That ’s not to say such software is off limits for criticism ; only that such software , when criticized , deserves at least some degree of slack .
In the traditional meaning of the word , “ beta ” comes before release .
Different developers have different definitions for precisely what it is that constitutes the beta cycle of software development , but a rough consensus might be “ feature complete but with essential bug fixes and polish not yet applied ” .
The home stretch is the hardest part of software development .
You ’ve already been working for months , often even a year or longer .
But just because you can see the finish line does n’t mean you ’re actually near it .
Sometimes half the engineering effort is spent on what seems like the last 10 percent of the project .
You want to ship .
You ’ve already blown the original deadline .
The software works , and you know it ’s cool , and you really think users are going to love it .
But if it is n’t done , it is n’t done .
What exactly is meant by software that is released , but labeled “ beta ” ?
That there are missing features ?
All software has missing features .
I ’ve never met a single developer working on a significant software project who has completely zeroed out the features - to - do list .
Knowing how to draw that line between features that make it for this release and features postponed for later is a big part of the art of shipping .
No , what “ beta ” means in this context is “ buggy ” .
It ’s a euphemism that siphons the cachet of “ beta ” in its traditional sense — that certain nerdy coolness that comes with being part of a private development process .
If you really think about its use in the context of released , commercial software , it ’s absurd .
An app is either good enough to release and sell , or else development is n’t yet done .
A label does n’t affect this equation .
Using “ beta ” as a badge of honor for released commercial software makes no more sense than using “ buggy ” in the same context , and it makes no more sense as an excuse , either .
Let ’s return to the “ but it ’s a beta ” disclaimers from the Disco critics I quoted at the outset , substituting “ buggy ” for “ beta ” :
“ It ’s only [ a buggy version ] and I ’m sure many of these issues will be fixed and I really do n’t want to heap on these guys too much because it looks like a really promising app . ”
“ Before I get flamed to high heaven , I am fully aware that Disco is currently [ BUGGY ] and it ’s not a final release candidate . ”
“ I know that this is a [ buggy ] release , and that the folks behind Disco continue to promise that there ’s more to come … ”
And my favorite :
“ You make some good points , but never mention that Disco is [ buggy ] . ”
My advice to fellow critics is that there ’s no need for disclaimers such as these .
My advice to developers is to realize that “ beta ” is a warning , not an excuse .
And if you ’re going to release software that you feel requires a warning , do n’t reach for a euphemism when a more accurate word is right at hand :

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The Iraqi government protested against a raid by U.S. forces in Baghdad on Sunday in which the military said 49 gunmen were killed in fierce fighting , but police and witnesses said claimed the lives of many civilians .
The fighting erupted during an operation in Sadr City , the main stronghold of anti-American Shi’ite cleric Moqtada , to capture an Iranian - linked militant suspected of abducting U.S. - led coalition soldiers and other foreigners .
Iraqi police said 13 civilians were killed and 69 wounded in the clashes , in which the U.S. military said troops backed by attack helicopters battled militants armed with rocket - propelled grenade launchers and machineguns .
Two of the victims were toddlers , Reuters Television pictures showed .
The U.S. military said it had no confirmation of any civilian casualties .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki protested about the “ excessive force ” against civilians in the Sadr City raid in his weekly meeting with General David Petraeus , the U.S. commander Iraq , government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said in an interview with CNN ’s Late Edition .
Iraqi officials have criticized the U.S. military in the past for operations that have resulted in the loss of civilian life , especially the use of air strikes in built - up areas .
Petraeus ’s spokesman , Colonel Steve Boylan , said it had been agreed to establish a committee that would consist of Iraqi cabinet officials and U.S. general officers to “ review the case and to refine mechanisms for the future ” .
BLACK SMOKE
Clouds of black smoke rose from Sadr City , a sprawling slum of some 2 million people in northern Baghdad , as sirens wailed , heavy gunfire echoed and U.S. attack helicopters circled above .
A U.S. military official said the target of the raid was suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of “ coalition force members and other foreigners ” in May this year and last November .
The official did not say whether he had been captured .
A U.S. army translator was kidnapped last October , and in May three U.S. soldiers and five Britons -- four security contractors and a civilian -- were abducted in two incidents .
“ The operation ’s objective was an individual reported to be a long - time Special Groups member specializing in kidnapping operations .
Intelligence indicates he ... has previously sought funding from Iran , ” the U.S. military said in a statement .

Special Groups is U.S. military jargon for rogue Mehdi Army units they say receive funding , training and weapons from neighboring Iran .
The U.S. military said its soldiers came under heavy machinegun and rocket - propelled - grenade fire from neighboring buildings at the start of the raid .
Troops returned fire , killing 33 .
Six more gunmen were killed in air strikes .
As the raiding party began withdrawing from the area , they continued to come under fire and were struck by a roadside bomb .
The military said soldiers shot back , killing 10 gunmen .

“ Ground forces reported they were unaware of any innocent civilians being killed as a result of this operation , ” the military said .
BLOOD -STAINED MATTRESSES
Local hospitals said they had received 12 bodies and 65 wounded , including eight women and children .
The bodies of the two slain toddlers , one in a diaper , lay on blankets in the morgue of Imam Ali hospital in Sadr City , where doctors tended to wounded men , some elderly , and boys , Reuters Television footage showed .
In a house where one of the children lived , a man pointed to bloodstained mattresses and blood - splattered pillows , choking back tears as he held up a photo of one of the dead .
Hundreds of local residents , wailing and chanting “ There is no God but Allah ” , carried wooden coffins through the streets .
The military gave few details about the high - profile abductions linked to the kidnap cell leader but said they took place this May and last November .
Three U.S. soldiers were kidnapped in an al Qaeda stronghold south of Baghdad in May .
The body of one was found later that month but the other two are classed as missing and captured .
Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the abductions .
The same month , five Britons were abducted from a Finance Ministry building in the Iraqi capital by gunmen wearing police uniforms in an attack blamed on Mehdi Army militants .
A U.S. army translator of Iraqi descent , was kidnapped in Baghdad on October 23 last year when he went to visit relatives .
His family said he was taken by the members of the Mehdi Army .
Moqtada al - Sadr froze the activities of the Mehdi Army at the end of August for six months after 52 were killed in gun battles between rival Shi’ite militias in the city of Kerbala .
In the newly discovered type of AGN , the disk and torus surrounding the black hole are so deeply obscured by gas and dust that no visible light escapes , making them very difficult to detect .
Some galaxies hide the normally bright output of supermassive black holes at their centers behind thick veils of dust and gas , a new study finds .
This phenomenon occurs in a type of galaxy called active galactic nuclei , or AGN , which that have active supermassive black holes at their cores .
The black holes feed on infalling gas and many emit powerful beams of radiation from their poles that shine with the energy of billions of stars , making them some of the most luminous objects in the universe .
In the newly discovered type of “ hidden ” AGN , the central black hole is so heavily shrouded by gas and dust that no visible light escapes .
As a result , these galaxies are difficult to detect and were missed by previous AGN surveys .
“ This is an important discovery because it will help us better understand why some supermassive black holes shine and others don’t , ” said study leader Jack Tueller of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland .
The finding , detailed in the Aug. 1 issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters , could also force scientists to reconsider the role they think supermassive black holes play in the evolution of their host galaxies .
Hidden black holes
Scientists have been steadily gathering evidence for this new type of AGN for the past two years .
Using NASA ’s Swift Telescope , Tueller and his colleagues spotted about 40 relatively nearby AGNs that were previously overlooked because their visible and ultraviolet light was dimmed by gas and dust .
Swift uncovered the AGNs because the telescope can detect high - energy X - rays , which can pierce through the dust and gas .
“ These are the same energies as the x-rays used in the doctor ’s office , ” Tueller told SPACE.com .
“ They ’re very penetrating .
They can go through the human body .
They can go through that accreting torus of matter . ”
The discoveries were followed up by American and Japanese astronomers using the U.S. / Japanese Suzaku X-ray observatory .
Scientists think AGNs are surrounded by donut - shaped rings of swirling material , which provide the fuel for the black holes .
AGNs are divided into several types depending on the viewing angle at which this ring is angled toward Earth .
A “ blazer , ” for example , is an AGN whose ring , or “ torus , ” lies roughly perpendicular to us .
As a result , one of its twin jets points directly at us .
Shells , not rings
Richard Mushotzky , an astronomer also at NASA Goddard and a member of Tueller ’s team , thinks the new AGNs are surrounded by a shell of gas and dust , instead of a typical ring .
This would have the effect of hiding nearly all of the visible and ultraviolet light produced by the AGN .
“ We can see visible light from other types of AGN because there is scattered light , ” Mushotzky explained .
“ But in these two galaxies , all the light coming from the nucleus is totally blocked . ”
The researchers estimate that hidden AGNs could provide up to 20 percent of the X - ray background , a glow of X - ray radiation that pervades the universe .
Factoring in these new types of objects help scientists better understand how supermassive black holes and their host galaxies co-evolve , the researchers say .
“ We think these black holes have played a crucial role in controlling the formation of galaxies , and they control the flow of matter into [ star ] clusters , ” Tueller said .
“ You ca n’t understand the universe without understanding giant black holes and what they ’re doing . ”

The infamous Duke Non-Rape , Non-Kidnapping , and Non-Sexual Assault Case is in our rearview mirror , but the spirit of the rogue prosecutor Michael B. Nifong lives on .
Rhode Island ’s attorney general now apparently is attempting to channel Nifongism and take it to places that even Nifong himself could not have imagined .
The following news story definitely describes one of the more outrageous prosecutions we might have seen yet , and compared to the Duke case , it makes Crystal Gail Mangum ’s statements look true by comparison :
Man charged 32 years after alleged rape
Saturday , June 23 , 2007
By Edward Fitzpatrick Journal Staff Writer
A 48 - year - old Narragansett man has been charged with raping someone 32 years ago when both he and the alleged victim were 16 years old , the attorney general ’s office said this week .
Harold Allen , of 30 Riverview Rd. , was indicted last month on a charge of first - degree sexual assault , and he pleaded not guilty , court records show .
Allen is accused of raping the girl in North Kingstown between April 1 and Oct. 31 , 1975 , the records show .
" The traumatized victim decided back then not to tell anybody what happened and repressed the memory of it until recently , " said Michael J. Healey , a spokesman for Attorney General Patrick C. Lynch ’s office .
" The victim came forward and made a complaint to the North Kingstown Police Department on June 15 , 2006 . "
No statute of limitations applies to charges of first - degree sexual assault , but Healey agreed it ’s unusual for charges to be filed more than three decades after an alleged crime .
" It is definitely out of the norm , but it ’s not unheard of , " he said .
Mr. Allen , it should be noted , vigorously denies all of the allegations :
Stone said Allen is now married , has two children who are high school age or older , and has never faced any criminal charges before — not even a traffic offense .
" He was shocked , " Stone said .
" He says they never had intercourse — willing , unwilling or otherwise . "
Stone said Allen and the woman grew up in the same neighborhood and their families knew each other , but they were never boyfriend and girlfriend .
" They were two teenagers who sat out on a rock and drank beer and wine in the neighborhood with other teenagers , as teenagers did , " he said .
As one who has really looked hard at the politics of rape and how the law handles such claims today , even this one floors me .
I will examine this claim in detail and point out that what the attorney general of Rhode Island has done has been to give the middle finger to due process and the rule of law .
In other words , it is par for the course for prosecutors these days .
First , and most important , there is no evidence except for this woman ’s claim .
Furthermore , she made her claim under the aegis of " recovered memories . "
The " theory " of recovered memories works in the following way : some people who have experienced traumatic experiences , such as a rape or witnessing a murder , then " repress " the memory and only bring it out under therapy .
What is most " interesting " ( actually , " fraudulent " is a much better word ) about these " memories " that have been brought to the fore is that they are memories that have improved with time .
Researchers who are intimately familiar with memories say unequivocally that memories become worse over time .
Second , these " recovered memories " are selective .
No doubt , she is forthcoming in all sorts of details about this " rape , " but can not remember when it was , whether it was in the spring , summer , or fall , a seven - month time frame .
Granted , the prosecutor has done that so that Mr. Allen cannot possibly line up an alibi defense , since if he says he was out of town on Day X , then the prosecution then will claim that the rape happened on Day Y , and when he finds evidence for what he did on Day Y , then the timeline will be moved to Day Z , and so on .
Third , taking a page out of Nifong ’s prosecution book , Lynch , the Rhode Island AG , held onto the story and did not make an arrest until after the indictment .
He did this in order to avoid a preliminary hearing , yet another grievous beach of due process .
When the allegations were made , or when he decided that they were " credible , " he could have ordered Mr. Allen arrested .
However , once he did that , the defendant than could request a preliminary hearing in which the prosecution would have been forced to present its evidence , and the complainant could have been put under cross examination .
Obviously , Lynch wanted to avoid having to deal directly with the evidence , given that he has none , except a woman who suddenly claims to have " remembered " a rape that allegedly occurred in 1975 .
One has to understand the utter cynicism in cases like this .
The enablers of the accuser — people like Wendy Murphy and others who were front - and - center in making accusations in the Duke case — will claim that if the woman did not confide in anyone when she was 16 , it was because the rape traumatized her , which then would be trotted out as " proof " that the rape occurred .
And if she did speak to someone , that , too , would be considered as " proof . "
Only with the politics of rape can one make mutually - exclusive claims , yet both are believed simultaneously and without question .
( Murphy , one might recall , was declaring that after North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped the charges against the three Duke defendants — even though he said that Mangum wanted to take the charges to a trial — the reason Cooper " had " to drop the charges was that one of the lacrosse parents had " paid off " Mangum and her family .
Thus , Murphy is trying to say simultaneously that Mangum wanted to continue the charade and yet drop it at the same time .
She provided no evidence for the alleged payoff ; she was making an ex cathedra statement that she expected the rest of us to believe without any qualifications whatsoever . )
Furthermore , these charges are not being filed by a small - town prosecutor or someone who cannot be controlled by the state ’s attorney general .
Indeed , these charges are being filed by Rhode Island ’s attorney general , who wants the rest of us to believe that all that is needed to bring serious criminal charges is the claim that someone has experienced " recovered memories . "
Of course , the very use of " recovered memories " therapy is controversial in itself , and pretty much fits into the " junk science " category .
According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists :
“ Psychiatrists are advised to avoid engaging in any “ memory recovery techniques ” which are based upon the expectation of past sexual abuse of which the patient has no memory .
Such … techniques may include drug- mediated interviews [ “ truth serum ” ] , hypnosis , regression therapies , guided imagery , “ body memories , ” literal dream interpretation , and journaling .
There is no evidence that the use of consciousness - altering techniques , such as drug - mediated interviews or hypnosis , can reveal or accurately elaborate factual information about any past experiences , including sexual abuse . ”
One might recall that one of the most controversial acts that Nifong did — other than bringing the original charges — was to completely change the timeline of the alleged crimes and change the nature of the alleged attacks , all on the " improved " memory of Mangum that came nine months after the original rape was said to have occurred .
In other words , Nifong was claiming that memory improves with time , which simply is not true .
I have another word to describe what Lynch has done : fraud .
Here is someone so hell - bent on bringing rape charges that he ignores all good science and depends upon discredited " junk science " to bring a case for which a defendant cannot be expected to mount any kind of defense , since the government simply will be able to constantly move the boundaries .
That the AG would bring these kinds of charges immediately after the Nifong affair was big news , speaks to the arrogance of prosecutors in general .
They have become a law unto themselves , and apparently believe that it is their right and duty to defraud the criminal justice system .
Given that Rhode Island is what one might call a " politically correct " state , we can expect the AG to have his bevy of supporters .
No doubt , Wendy Murphy herself will weigh in on this nonsense and claim that Mr. Allen must be a rapist , since someone used " recovered memories " to accuse him of that crime .
That alone , people will argue , constitutes " proof " that he is guilty .

Skype was bought by eBay in September 2005
The online auction firm said Skype was worth $ 900 m ( £ 450 m ) less than it paid for it and set aside $ 530 m to meet future pay - outs to some shareholders .
Together that amounts to a loss of value of $ 1.43bn , compared to the $ 2.6 bn price paid for Skype in 2005 .
Skype founders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis have quit as executives .
" I think this is a testament that the Skype franchise is not worth as much as eBay originally thought , " said Youssef Squali of the brokerage Jeffries & Co .
Skype generated only $ 90 m in revenue in the three months to the end of June , eBay said .
Other projects
At the time of the purchase , eBay had said it may pay up to $ 1.7bn on top of the $ 2.6bn , depending on performance .
News that this would not happen sent its shares up 1.6 % to an 18 - month closing high .
If you take Skype out of the equation , the rest of the eBay business seems to be doing great again
Steve Weinstein , Pacific Crest Securities
Analysts said that this also reflected the greater flexibility eBay may now have , following the change in personnel .
However , eBay said it might pay Skype shareholders another $ 195 m , but only if it sells 50 % or more of Skype before the end of March 2008 .
Mr Zennstrom , who was chief executive of Skype , will become non-executive chairman and is expected to spend more time on other projects .
After the Skype sale , he and Mr Friis founded an online video company called Joost.com .
Joost , which had previously only been available by invitation , made its software freely available on Monday .
Analysts said that while Skype had not made a lot of money , eBay itself remained a strong business .
" If you take Skype out of the equation , the rest of the eBay business seems to be doing great again , " said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Steve Weinstein .
" EBay management has found ways to re-accelerate the core ( auctions ) market .
Lots of its businesses are doing extremely well . "
The continent - wide nature of the event implies that it was caused by something in the atmosphere
Dr Mark Sephton , Imperial College London
This " great dying " 250 million years ago killed off more than two - thirds of reptile and amphibian families .
But it also facilitated the rise of the dinosaurs , which would rule Earth for the next 185 million years .
New evidence comes from molecules preserved in rocks laid down at the time of the extinction .
Other causes suggested for the extinction have included an asteroid colliding with our planet or a massive release of methane from the deep sea .
Scientists already know the so - called end -Permian extinction coincided with a major volcanic eruption .
This caused the biggest ever outpouring of basalt lava , covering vast swathes of land in what is now Siberia .
It created the Siberian Traps , a large province of igneous rocks centred around the city of Tura .
' Soil crisis '
Now , analysis of a unique set of molecules found in rocks taken from the Dolomite mountains in Italy sheds light on the environmental impact of this eruption .
The molecules are the remains of polysaccharides , large sugar - based structures common in plants and soil .
However , these rocks are the remains of marine sediments .
Trilobites were one of the groups killed off in the extinction
The authors of the Geology paper believe volcanic gases from the eruption would have depleted Earth 's protective ozone layer and acidified the land and sea , killed rooted vegetation .
This would have hindered the retention of soil and allowed it to be washed into the surrounding oceans .
Soil materials in the oceans would have blocked out light and soaked up oxygen .
Analysis of rock chemistry suggests that after the so - called " soil crisis " on land , the marine ecosystem succumbed to the stresses of environmental change .
Oceanic life faltered , completing a global catastrophe .
" The cause of the end - Permian extinction has been highly controversial .
We show that the terrestrial ecosystem was the first to suffer , " said co-author Dr Mark Sephton of Imperial College London .
" The continent - wide nature of the event implies that it was caused by something in the atmosphere .
The unique chemical data indicates that something fast and catastrophic happened on land . "
The research was carried out by an international team of scientists from the UK , the Netherlands and the US .

Most politicians , when they talk about reducing spending , chatter on about cutting waste and fraud .
That ’s OK , but it ’s a mere nick on the federal budget .
If you really want to reduce spending , you must dismantle the overseas empire .
Excluding Iraq , Afghanistan and the other facilities in the Gulf states that have been built since the Republican war , the Pentagon lists 702 overseas bases in 130 foreign countries on which are stationed more than 250,000 uniformed troops .
There are also dependents and civilian employees on many of those bases .
One of the oldest military clichés is that the generals always want to fight the last war over again .
Well , there ’s some truth to that .
In fact , though , we will never again fight World War II , so why in the heck do we have bases still in Germany , Italy , Japan , Guam and South Korea ?
Just whom do we expect to fight from these bases ?
How do they contribute to the defense of the U.S. ?
They do n’t .
They are , frankly , a residue of World War II and a reminder that the military is , after all , a bureaucracy and hates the very idea of " losing " any facilities and billets .
We do n’t need to have troops permanently stationed in any of these countries .
Nor do we need to maintain our membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , which is a residue from the Cold War .
I do n’t wish to disillusion anyone , but Asia and Europe are not our responsibilities .
If there is any need for defense , it is the responsibility of the countries on those continents .
We know from personal experience that Japan and Germany can field large and competent armies if they should decide they need them .
They do not need our protection .
At the present , there are only two countries in the world that have the capability of waging war against us .
Those are China and Russia .
In both cases , the war would be fought with intercontinental ballistic missiles .
We are never going to see a land war with either of those countries .
It should be the No. 1 priority of our foreign - policy establishment to see that we never have a war at all with either of these countries .
Wars start when empires wish to expand .
That was the cause of the Spanish - American War , World War I and World War II .
The Korean and Vietnam wars were civil wars in which our politicians involved us .
The wars against Afghanistan and Iraq are again wars of an empire trying to expand .
In these cases , we are the empire , and you might as well face the ugly truth that our invasions of both countries were no different from the Nazi invasions that led to World War II .
Neither Afghanistan nor Iraq had attacked us or were even capable of attacking us .
In Afghanistan , we could have gone after al - Qaeda without overthrowing the Taliban government .
In the case of Iraq , like Adolf Hitler did with Poland , we simply published a pack of lies to justify our invasion .
Americans need to realize that we are not the police force of the world .
It is not our responsibility to overthrow dictators or effect regime change in other people ’s countries .
It is not our responsibility to stop slaughters such as seem to be a permanent feature of Africa .
If we could only learn to mind our own business and see to the needs of our own people , we could lead a peaceful , prosperous and happy existence .
As for the terrorists , they are mainly a problem for intelligence and police .
If any military force is necessary , one company of Rangers or Marines would be enough .
You ca n’t have a free republic and an empire .
It is time to choose .

The strange bedfellows relationship between Mary Matalin and James Carville may have been considered a novelty at one time , but the novelty wore off a long time ago .
In fact , it 's painfully obvious that it 's done nothing for Democrats for a long time -- and it's high time we put an end the notion that James Carville is an ally of -- or should ever be considered a legitimate spokesman for -- the left .
He talks a good game , but let 's not forget his support for Scooter Libby or the phone call he made to Matalin the day after the 2004 presidential election , alerting her to John Kerry 's decision to contest the provisional ballots in Ohio which ultimately resulted in a call to Cheney and a heads up to Republican Secretary of State for Ohio , Kenneth Blackwell ... and we know how that turned out .

Watching this clip from this morning 's Meet The Press there 's no doubt who wears the pants in this relationship .
Watch Carville giggle like a school boy as Matalin makes a veiled sexual reference toward him .
James has been proven to put his relationship before his job time and time again .
I have no problem with that , what they do in their relationship is none of our business -- until it becomes a liability and then we have to speak out and do something about it .
I have never understood Nick Carr ’s objections to the cultural effects of the internet .
He ’s much too smart to lump in with nay - sayers like Keen , and when he talks about the effects of the net on business , he sounds more optimistic , even factoring in the wrenching transition , so why are n’t the cultural effects similar cause for optimism , even accepting the wrenching transition in those domains as well ?
I think I finally got understood the dichotomy between his reading of business and culture after reading Long Player , his piece on metadata and what he calls “ the myth of liberation ” , a post spurred in turn by David Weinberger ’s Everything Is Miscellaneous .
Carr discusses the ways in which the long - playing album was both conceived of and executed as an aesthetic unit , its length determined by a desire to hold most of the classical canon on a single record , and its possibilities exploited by musicians who created for the form — who created albums , in other words , rather than mere bags of songs .
He illustrates this with an exegesis of the Rolling Stones ’ Exile on Main Street , showing how the overall construction makes that album itself a work of art .
Carr uses this point to take on what he calls the myth of liberation : “ This mythology is founded on a sweeping historical revisionism that conjures up an imaginary predigital world – a world of profound physical and economic constraints – from which the web is now liberating us . ”
Carr observes , correctly , that the LP was what it was in part for aesthetic reasons , and the album , as a unit , became what it became in the hands of people who knew how to use it .
That is not , however , the neat story Carr wants to it be , and the messiness of the rest of the story is key , I think , to the anxiety about the effects on culture , his and others .
The LP was an aesthetic unit , but one designed within strong technical constraints .
When Edward Wallerstein of Columbia Records was trying to figure out how long the long - playing format should be , he settled on 17 minutes a side as something that would “ …enable about 90 % of all classical music to be put on two sides of a record . ”
But why only 90 % ?
Because 100 % would be impossible — the rest of the canon was too long for the technology of the day .
And why should you have to flip the record in the middle ?
Why not have it play straight through ?
Impossible again .
Contra Carr , in other words , the pre-digital world was a world of profound physical and economic constraints .
The LP could hold 34 minutes of music , which was a bigger number of minutes than some possibilities ( 33 possibilities , to be precise ) , but smaller than an infinite number of others .
The album as a form provided modest freedom embedded in serious constraints , and the people who worked well with the form accepted those constraints as a way of getting at those freedoms .
And now the constraints are gone ; there is no necessary link between an amount of music and its playback vehicle .
And what Carr dislikes , I think , is evidence that the freedoms of the album were only as valuable as they were in the context of the constraints .
If Exile on Main Street was as good an idea as he thinks it was , it would survive the removal of those constraints .
And it has n’t .
Here is the iTunes snapshot of Exile , sorted by popularity :
The only way to support the view that Exile is best listened to as an album , in other words , is to dismiss the actual preferences of most of the people who like the Rolling Stones .
Carr sets about this task with gusto :
While we ca n’t get absolute numbers from this , we can get relative ones — many more people want to listen to Tumbling Dice or Happy than Ventilator Blues or Turd on the Run , even though iTunes makes it cheaper per song to buy the whole album .
Even with a financial inducement to preserve the album form , the users still say no thanks .
Who would unbundle Exile on Main Street or Blonde on Blonde or Tonight ’s the Night – or , for that matter , Dirty Mind or Youth and Young Manhood or ( Come On Feel the ) Illinoise ?
Only a fool would .
Only a fool .
If you are one of those people who has , say , Happy on your iPod ( as I do ) , then you are a fool ( though you have lots of company ) .
And of course this foolishness extends to the recording industry , and to the Stones themselves , who went and put Tumbling Dice on a Greatest Hits collection .
( One can only imagine how Carr feels about Greatest Hits collections . )
I think Weinberger ’s got it right about liberation , even taking at face value the cartoonish version Carr offers .
Prior to unlimited perfect copyability , media was defined by profound physical and economic constraints , and now it ’s not .
Fewer constraints and better matching of supply and demand are good for business , because business is not concerned with historical continuity .
Fewer constraints and better matching of supply and demand are bad for current culture , because culture continually mistakes current exigencies for eternal verities .
This is n’t just Carr of course .
As people come to realize that freedom destroys old forms just as surely as it creates new ones , the lament for the long - lost present is going up everywhere .
As another example , Sven Birkerts , the literary critic , has a post in the Boston Globe , Lost in the blogosphere , that is almost indescribably self - involved .
His two complaints are that newspapers are reducing the space allotted to literary criticism , and too many people on the Web are writing about books .
In other words , literary criticism , as practiced during Birkerts ’ lifetime , was just right , and having either fewer or more writers are both lamentable situations .
In order that the “ Life was better when I was younger ” flavor of his complaint not become too obvious , Birkerts frames the changing landscape not as a personal annoyance but as A Threat To Culture Itself .
As he puts it “ … what we have been calling “ culture ” at least since the Enlightenment — is the emergent maturity that constrains unbounded freedom in the interest of mattering . ”
This is silly .
The constraints of print were not a product of “ emergent maturity . ”
They were accidents of physical production .
Newspapers published book reviews because their customers read books and because publishers took out ads , the same reason they published pieces about cars or food or vacations .
Some newspapers hired critics because they could afford to , others did n’t because they could n’t .
Ordinary citizens did n’t write about books in a global medium because no such medium existed .
None of this was an attempt to “ constrain unbounded freedom ” because there was no such freedom to constrain ; it was just how things were back then .
Genres are always created in part by limitations .
Albums are as long as they are because that Wallerstein picked a length his engineers could deliver .
Novels are as long as they are because Aldus Manutius ’s italic letters and octavo bookbinding could hold about that many words .
The album is already a marginal form , and the novel will probably become one in the next fifty years , but that also happened to the sonnet and the madrigal .
I ’m old enough to remember the dwindling world , but it never meant enough to me to make me a nostalgist .
In my students ’ work I see hints of a culture that takes both the new freedoms and the new constraints for granted , but the fullest expression of that world will probably come after I ’m dead .
But despite living in transitional times , I ’m not willing to pretend that the erosion of my worldview is a crisis for culture itself .
It ’s just how things are right now .
Carr fails to note that the LP was created for classical music , but used by rock and roll bands .
Creators work within whatever constraints exist at the time they are creating , and when the old constraints give way , new forms arise while old ones dwindle .
Some work from the older forms will survive — Shakespeare ’s 116th sonnet remains a masterwork — while other work will wane —
Exile as an album - length experience is a fading memory .
This kind of transition is n’t a threat to Culture Itself , or even much of a tragedy , and we should resist attempts to preserve old constraints in order to defend old forms .

" You 've got your Ron Paul folks out there , so I 'm not a big believer in that particular poll , " said Hannity after the results were announced .
The text voting showed Paul had edged his nearest competitor , former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , by seven percentage points , and trounced Rudy Giuliani -- the leader in many national telephone polls -- by a margin of 23 .
In a post - debate interview , Paul had pointed out to Hannity that his performance in polls such as Fox 's might have something to do with what he calls a softening tone from leading Republican contenders , who he says are n't " nearly as militant " as they were some months ago .
Paul is the only GOP candidate calling for the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
" So you think you 've Ron Paulized them ? " asked Hannity , referring to his own trademarked phrase , " Hannitized , " which he uses to describe a successful political conversion .
" Well , they have to to listen to these polls , do n't they ? " said Paul of his primary rivals .
But Hannity laughed off the unscientific text poll .
" You 've got all your supporters , " Hannity said , making a brushing - away motion with his hand .
" You mean your own poll is n't any good ? " asked Paul .
" No , " said Hannity .
" It 's just a lot of fun . "
Staunch supporters on the internet have brought Rep .
Paul strong showings in recent online polls , and the congressman was also cited earlier this month as the Republican candidate who has raised the most money among donors identified as affiliated with the military .
Asked earlier in the segment if he would rally behind the Republican nominee for president in the event he himself was not nominated , the famously Libertarian - leaning Paul would not pledge to automatically throw his support to someone from his party .
" I would n't ever give a blanket check for that , " the candidate said , adding later that the notion would " undo everything I 've stood for for 30 years . "
However , he did not rule out endorsing one of the Republican frontrunners .

In interview after interview in newspapers and on TV , Ms. Giovanni has described a student whose behavior caused her creative writing class to drop from about 70 to 7 students in the fall of 2005 .
" Once I realized my class was scared , I knew I had to do something , " she told The Washington Post .
So she confronted him about the dark sunglasses and maroon cap he would wear in class and the darker poetry that he would write .
The Washington Post wrote this morning :
" You ca n’t do that , " she told him , referring to the " intimidating " poems .
" You ca n’t make me , " he replied .
" Yeah , I can . "
Her next step was to lobby the department head , Lucinda Roy , writing a letter requesting he leave the class , she told CNN .
And she was ready to go all the way .
" I was willing to resign before I would continue with him , " she told CNN .
" It was the meanness . "
The NY Times reported today that Professor Roy started teaching him in a one - on - one workshop , and it did n’t take long for her , too , to worry for her own safety , working out a secret alarm with her assistant .
" If she mentioned the name of a dead professor , her assistant would know it was time to call security , "
Later in the CNN interview , Professor Giovanni said that reports on Monday that the gunman was Asian left " no doubt " in her mind who did it .
Her interviewer ’s shock led her to make something very clear .
" But I ’m not prescient , " she said .
It almost sounded like an apology , one that will probably be repeated as more warning signs emerge .
Unfortunately Ms. Giovanni's insights into the potential danger Cho represented is a lesson learned only in hindsight of the tragedy .
Now every cop and FBI agent is a literary critic , seeing in Cho ’s undergraduate plays dark hints of what was to come .
But by that logic , Shakespeare ( who wrote a play in which a woman is raped and then her tongue cut our and hands chopped off to prevent her revealing who did it ) was a psychopath .
Cho ’s writing was one element in a larger , complex picture that no one could see completely .
The quandary for school administrators is that any number of eccentric loners may be students and they may also write morbidly violent compositions in a writing class .
The problem is figuring out the students who may be dangerous to themselves or others .
It gets into some very gray areas of the First Amendment when you start expelling students for violent content in their creative writing class .
We do n't even know if expelling those students is safe because expelling a student with violent ideation may be the very event that triggers a killing rampage .
Ms. Giovanni made her controversial debut as a self described black revolutionary poet in 1968 with a volume of poetry entitled Black Judgment .
Her influence on the black consciousness movement remains huge 4 decades later .
Labiaplasty , Vaginoplasty , and Clitoral Unhooding — Feminine Cosmetic Genital Surgery ( FCGS )
Labiaplasty ( labia reduction & beautification ) and other female cosmetic surgical procedures including Vaginoplasty ( rejuvenation or tightening of the vagina ) and Clitoral Unhooding ( Hoodectomy ) , are becoming more popular as social acceptance of these cosmetic and reconstructive procedures continues toward mainstream .
Labia surgery , which usually involves labia reduction — and vaginal rejuvenation , or tightening , are becoming as common today as other cosmetic procedures , including tummy tucks and breast augmentation .
New advancements and techniques in Labiaplasty and Vaginoplasty typically lessen scarring , pain , recovery time , and show excellent results in the area sometimes referred to as Vaginal Cosmetic Surgery .
Labiaplasty , Vaginoplasty , and Clitoral Unhooding — Three Surgical Procedures For Three Different Problems
Labiaplasty ( view Labiaplasty Before and After Photos ) is for women who have a problem with large labia , asymmetric labia or related female genital issues .
Labiaplasty permits the reduction of large labia ( labia minora and labia majora ) to reduce their outward appearance and correct misshapenness or irregularities .
Vaginoplasty ( view Vaginoplasty Before and After Photos ) — often called vaginal rejuvenation or reconstruction — is another surgical procedure that can help women who ’ve had multiple childbirths by offering a surgical remedy to tighten and enhance the sensitivity of the vagina .
Finally , Clitoral Unhooding ( Hoodectomy ) , offers women new heightened sensation , arousal and increased personal satisfaction in their sex lives .
The number of procedures in each surgical area ( Labiaplasty , Vaginoplasty , Clitoral Unhooding ) has been dramatically increasing .
The American Society of Plastic Surgeons ( ASPS ) only recently began collecting information on vaginal rejuvenation ( Vaginoplasty ) in 2005 — exclusively from their membership — but the growth in this area alone was shown to increase almost thirty percent ( 29.9 % ) , from 2006 , far eclipsing all but two other cosmetic procedures ( Calf Implants & Pectoral Implants ) .
It ’s important to note that these numbers do not include the majority of procedures performed by OB / GYNs , Cosmetic Surgeons , and Urologists .
Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery ( FGCS ) — of which Vaginal Plastic Surgery is part — is a demanding surgical field , and few surgeons are skilled enough to perform the delicate procedures with good results .
Some surgeons are formally trained in female medicine , as OB - GYNs — while others , equally competent , are plastic surgeons , cosmetic surgeons , and urologists .
All are trained to understand the artistic nature of the procedure ; and desired results that women expect .
In almost every instance , women should only consider these types of surgical specialists when having one of these procedures performed .

“ The most important decision you ’ll make is NOT whether to have a labiaplasty , or vaginoplasty procedure performed . . . the MOST important decision you ’ll make is to find the best surgeon for the procedure . ”
To Begin , Why All The Buzz About Labiaplasty And Vaginoplasty ?
Over the last few years , there ’s been a stream of information about feminine cosmetic genital surgeries such as labiaplasty and vaginoplasty , and as well , varying opinions from different groups about one ’s right to choose and necessity of such procedures .
A vast majority of medical professionals say these procedures are needed and serve a vital purpose helping afflicted individuals with functional and emotional issues .
The reason for all the chatter about these procedures is that they typically address confidential issues that are sensitive in nature .
But , the most important thing to remember is that labiaplasty and vaginoplasty — when done by properly trained and experienced surgeons — greatly improves issues resulting from asymmetric labia , or multiple or difficult child birth .
As such , they genuinely improve one ’s self - esteem .
Do FCGS Procedures Such as Labiaplasty , Vaginoplasty or Clitoral Unhooding Improve an Individual ’s Quality of Life ?
Had you asked this question less than a decade ago you would have raised more than a few eyebrows . . . and gotten few accurate , if any , responses .
But , the answer to the question is a resounding yes . . . as documented in the largest patient satisfaction study ever published .
Labiaplasty ( reduction and / or reshaping of the labia ) and other female cosmetic surgical procedures including Vaginoplasty ( repair or tightening of the vagina ) and Clitoral Unhooding ( Hoodectomy or unsheathing of the clitoris ) , have gained prominence in social circles and acceptance because they address serious issues for women .
Labia surgery involves labia reduction and reshaping for any number of reasons — most commonly it is for women who have problems with large labia ( hypertrophic labia ) , and asymmetric labia ( lack of equal or visually - balanced appearance ) .
In these cases , labiaplasty can help to reduce the outward appearance of large labia ( labia minora and labia majora ) and correct misshapenness or symmetry irregularities .
Finally , many new surgical techniques are now available and each may work better in a particular situation ( not all labia have the same problem ) .
The most accepted , non-radical surgical methods are available for review so you may see the options and be well informed during the evaluation discussions with your surgeon .
Labiaplasty Is Medically Indicated If Two Criteria Are Met —
Deciding to undergo a genital surgical procedure such as labiaplasty , vaginoplasty or hoodectomy , begins with the evaluation of the need .
For labiaplasty , many women dislike the large appearance of their labia minora .
This may cause severe embarrassment with a sexual partner or loss of self - esteem , and in some cases pain and discomfort .
Not long ago , labiaplasty was usually only performed on a select group of entertainers and performers — women such as swimsuit models , and centerfold models .
But today , with the advent of more sexually permissive magazines and videos ; apparel and behavior ; the appearance of female genitalia are much more relevant to both men and women .
Medical or functional indications / reasons for labiaplasty ( labia surgery ) can include asymmetry ( uneven dimensions of the labia ) or labial hypertrophy disorders , such as the need for the reduction of tissue from overly large or thick labia minora that can result in constant irritation in tight pants and discomfort when engaging in sports or other physical activities .
These are labeled functional issues .
In many of these cases , most women are either born with large labia or they become enlarged at puberty .
Sometimes they may develop this condition with childbirth ( torn tissues ) or age .
In these cases , surgery of the labia represents a relatively safe solution .
Aesthetic and self - esteem indications / reasons for labiaplasty are largely being driven by societal evolution regarding sexual habits , wants , and expectations .
There is a societal evolution currently occurring about how men and women perceive each other in areas of sexual expectation , SPECIFICALLY when it comes to sexual performance and appearance .
This is a perfectly normal expectation .
Women in everyday life are now demanding more options when it comes to a safe , accepted , minor surgical procedure that helps one ’s self - esteem .
Most women seek sculpting of the labia to achieve a better look for themselves and their sexual partner .
This can include even age - related enhancement for women who are older and want a return to the youthful look they had when they were younger .
And today , this can usually be accomplished through labia reduction surgery . . . now at a reasonable cost .
The bottom line is that aesthetic surgical labial reduction can greatly improve the aesthetic appearance and functionality of abnormally enlarged labia , ( labial hypertrophy ) and improve self - esteem .
The Reasons for Getting a Vaginoplasty Are Considerably Different Than Labiaplasty —
Vaginoplasty involves issues that affect women who have given birth vaginally , have had multiple children , difficult child birth , or those who have had a large baby .
As vaginoplasty is not an external surgery of the body , and instead involves internal work , it is not based on aesthetic issues .
Largely , it deals with tightening of the tissues of the vaginal vault , or inner chamber ( forneces ) via methods to reduce volumetric capacity — to provide greater friction during sexual intercourse .
Vaginal enlargement is frequently a problem after natural childbirth of a large baby or a difficult delivery .
Typically , the vagina and its supporting muscles and tissues , becomes stretched and / or torn during childbirth — this can include the area known as the pelvic floor — which sadly , almost never returns to its former state after normal childbirth has occurred .
The specialized surgical tightening and rejuvenation of the vagina , perineum , and the supporting muscles , is Vaginoplasty .
Evolution in societal views about sexuality and marital relationships has resulted in increasing numbers of vaginoplasty procedures over the last several years .
Many of the same social views that inhibited labiaplasty are also being cast aside with vaginoplasty .
Many women , whose children are now grown , are now seeking renewal of the vaginal tissues — vaginal tightening — specifically to enhance the sexual experience they have with existing or new mates .
Combination Labiaplasty & Vaginoplasty : Only a few specialized surgeons perform Vaginoplasty ( rejuvenation & tightening ) and Labiaplasty ( reduction & beautification ) at the same time .
There are women who have been self conscious and bothered by large labia for years , but did nothing about it .
Now , at the same time that they rejuvenate their sex lives thru Vaginoplasty — returning the vagina and supporting structures to a “ pre-pregnancy ” state — they can have their labia reduced and beautified ; relieving any discomfort and self - consciousness they may have experienced in the past .
The real advantage to having a combination surgery performed is that there is only one anesthesia session , and this usually results in considerable savings in procedural cost .

Clitoral Unhooding , or Hoodectomy , is a surgical procedure to enhance a woman ’s sexual pleasure during intercourse .
Hymenoplasty ( Hymen repair or reconstruction ) : LabiaplastySurgeon.com is sensitive to the needs of women whose cultures and religions embrace the need for unbroken hymen structure .
As well , we discretely and confidentially help many women who have , sadly , been the victims of child molestation , child abuse , or rape .
Many of our surgeons have years of experience in dealing with these problems and can assist you by calling them directly .
Please feel free to call or email any of our surgeons about this special procedure .
G - Spot Anatomy , Stimulation , Enhancement : Simply stated , G - Spot stimulation does not affect every woman in the same way .
It ’s even reported that less than ten percent of all women ever achieve sexual climax as a result of natural or artificial stimulation of this region .
Still , many women have reported that they DO get sexual satisfaction from stimulation of the G - Spot .
As well , many women have read about enhancing or enlarging ( engorging ) this region via artificial fillers or fat transfer that can be achieved via surgical procedures .
Female sexual enhancement is defined as anything that enhances a woman ’s sexuality .
This would include any procedures that improve ones self - image .
Breast enlargement would be an example of the most frequent surgical procedures in this category .
However , cosmetic surgery of the female external genitalia has been neglected and frequently overlooked because of conventional views on sexual acceptance .
These views are now in a state of evolution yielding a more confident acceptance that these medical issues can be addressed with minor surgery .
Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery ( FGCS ) — of which Vaginal Plastic Surgery is part — is a demanding surgical field , and few surgeons are skilled enough to perform the delicate procedures with good results .
Some surgeons are formally trained in female medicine , as OB - GYNs — while others , equally competent , are plastic surgeons , cosmetic surgeons , vaginal cosmetic surgeons and urogynocologists .
All the experienced surgeons , like those on this web portal are trained to understand the function and artistic aspects of the procedure . . . and results that women expect .
In almost every instance , women should only consider these types of surgical specialists when having one of these procedures performed .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Mr. Bill Gates ! Mr. Bill Gates ! " a young woman shrieks as the black car pulls up .
A pallid student in a nylon windbreaker pushes his way through the security line and hands the world 's richest man a small envelope with a floral design .
" It 's very important , " he pants .
Another day in China , another round of adulation .
Today the Microsoft ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) chairman is being named an honorary trustee of Peking University .
Yesterday it was an honorary doctorate from Beijing 's Tsinghua University - the 13th in the school 's 82 - year history .
Gates , wearing the same lopsided grin he has had on his face for the past few days , takes the envelope from the young man .
For him this is a triumphant visit to China , a victory lap of sorts , on which I 've been invited to tag along .
The country is his .
No other Fortune 500 CEO gets quite the same treatment in China .
While most would count themselves lucky to talk with one of China 's top leaders , Gates will meet with four members of the Politburo on this four - day April trip .
As one government leader put it while introducing Gates at a business conference , the Microsoft chairman is " bigger in China than any movie star . "
Last spring President Hu Jintao toured the Microsoft campus in Redmond , Wash . , and was feted at a dinner at Gates ' home .
" You are a friend to the Chinese people , and I am a friend of Microsoft , " Hu told his host .
" Every morning I go to my office and use your software . "
It was not always so .
Microsoft bumbled for years after entering China in 1992 , and its business was a disaster there for a decade .
It finally figured out that almost none of the basic precepts that led to its success in the U.S. and Europe made sense in China .
There Microsoft had to become the un-Microsoft - pricing at rock bottom instead of charging hundreds of dollars for its Windows operating system and Office applications ; abandoning the centerpiece of its public - policy approach elsewhere , the protection of its intellectual property at all costs ; and closely partnering with the government instead of fighting it as in the U.S. , a stance that has opened the company to criticism from human rights groups .
" It took Microsoft 15 years and billions of dollars of lost revenue to learn how to do business in China , " says Sigurd Leung , who follows the company at research firm Analysys International in Beijing .
" We were a naive American company , " concedes Gates in an interview in his car as he is driven to yet another meeting with government leaders .
" You 've got to just keep trying and trying and trying . "
But now , he says , snacking on Pringles and Diet Coke , " we have a wonderful position in China , and we 're going to see great growth every year for the next five years . "
Gates says he 's certain China will eventually be Microsoft 's biggest market , though it may take ten years .
Projected sales this year are already three times what they were in 2004 , yet still less than annual revenue in California .
( Microsoft will not disclose figures , but Fortune estimates China revenue will exceed $ 700 million in 2007 , about 1.5 % of global sales . )
Now Microsoft even has its own five - year plan in China , formulated to match up with the government's .
Says Robert Hormats , a longtime China watcher at Goldman Sachs : " It 's a great turnaround story with wonderful lessons for other companies . "
False start
The story begins 15 years ago , when Microsoft sent a couple of sales managers into China from Taiwan .
Their mission ?
Sell software at the same prices the company charged elsewhere .
Says Craig Mundie , the top Microsoft executive who now guides its China strategy : " It was the classic model - hang out a shingle and say , ' Microsoft : Open for business . ' "
But the model did n't work .
The problem was n't brand acceptance ; everyone was using Windows .
It 's just that no one was paying .
Counterfeit copies could be bought on the street for a few dollars .
As Ya - Qin Zhang , who heads Microsoft 's Chinese R&D , puts it : " In China we did n't have problems with market share .
The issue is how do we translate that into revenue . "
Microsoft fought bitterly to protect its intellectual property .
It sued companies for using its software illegally but lost regularly in court .
Its executives , who often disagreed with the strategy , failed in its implementation .
Country managers came and went - five in one five - year period .
Two of them later wrote books criticizing the company .
One , Juliet Wu , whose " Up Against the Wind " became a local bestseller , wrote that Microsoft heartlessly sought sales by any means , that its antipiracy policy was needlessly heavy - handed , and that her own efforts to help bosses in Redmond understand China had been rebuffed .
Then a different form of resistance emerged .
Beijing 's city government started installing free open - source Linux operating systems on workers '
PCs .
( The Chinese Academy of Sciences promoted a version called Red Flag Linux . )
Meanwhile security officials were troubled that government and military operations depended on Microsoft software made in the U.S. Could the technology be spying on China ?
In 1999 , Gates sent Mundie , who heads the company 's public - policy efforts , to figure out why Microsoft was so reviled .
On the trip he had an epiphany : " I remember going back to Redmond and saying , ' Our business is just broken in China , ' " Mundie recalls .
He concluded that the company was assigning executives too junior and that selling per se was overemphasized .
" But where we were most broken , " he says , " was that our business practices and our engagement did not reflect the importance of having a collaborative approach with the government . "
Mundie started visiting China four or five times a year .
He brought 25 of the company 's 100 vice presidents for a week - long " China Immersion Tour . "
He hired former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to advise him and open doors .
And he told leaders that Microsoft wanted to help China develop its own software industry , an urgent government priority .
The company even commissioned a McKinsey study for Chinese officials in 2001 that , among other things , recommended improving the protection of intellectual property .
Mundie also began talks with Chinese security officials to convince them that Microsoft 's software was not a secret tool of the U.S. government .
As a result , in 2003 the company offered China and 59 other countries the right to look at the fundamental source code for its Windows operating system and to substitute certain portions with their own software - something Microsoft had never allowed in the past .
Now when China uses Windows in President Hu's office , or for that matter in its missile systems , it can install its own cryptography .
But it was a relatively small step in 1998 - the opening of a research center in Beijing - that proved a turning point .
" We just started it here because we thought they 'd do great research , " says Gates , who raves about the quality of the country 's computer scientists .
The lab was what Gates calls a " windfall " for Microsoft 's image .
It began accumulating an impressive record of academic publications , helped lure back smart �migr� scientists , and contributed key components to globally released products like the Vista operating system .
The lab soon became , according to polls , the most desirable place in the country for computer scientists to work .
By 2001 , Microsoft executives were coming to the conclusion that China 's weak IP - enforcement laws meant its usual pricing strategies were doomed to fail .
Gates argued at the time that while it was terrible that people in China pirated so much software , if they were going to pirate anybody 's software he 'd certainly prefer it be Microsoft's .
Today Gates openly concedes that tolerating piracy turned out to be Microsoft 's best long - term strategy .
That 's why Windows is used on an estimated 90 % of China 's 120 million PCs .
" It 's easier for our software to compete with Linux when there 's piracy than when there 's not , " Gates says .
" Are you kidding ?
You can get the real thing , and you get the same price . "
Indeed , in China 's back alleys , Linux often costs more than Windows because it requires more disks .
And Microsoft 's own prices have dropped so low it now sells a $ 3 package of Windows and Office to students .

It is rare for a company to dominate its industry while claiming not to be motivated by money .
Google does .
But it has yet to face a crisis
Corbis
IN AMERICA a phenomenon might claim to have entered mainstream culture only after it has been satirised on “ The Simpsons ” .
Google has had that honour , and in a telling way .
Marge Simpson types her name into Google 's search engine and is amazed to get 629,000 results .
( “ And all this time I thought ‘ googling yourself ' meant the other thing . ” )
She then looks up her house on Google Maps , goes to “ satellite view ” and zooms in .
To her horror , she sees Homer lying naked in a hammock outside .
“ Everyone can see you ; get inside , ” she yells out of the window , and the fumbling proceeds from there .
And that , in a nutshell , sums up Google today : it dominates the internet and guides people everywhere , such as Marge , to the information they want .
But it also increasingly frightens some users by making them feel that their privacy has been intruded upon ( though Marge , technically , could not have seen Homer in real time , since Google 's satellite pictures are not live ) .
And it is making enemies in its own and adjacent industries .
The grand moment of Marge googling herself , for example , was instantly available not only through Fox , the firm that created the animated television show , but also on YouTube , a video site owned by Google , after fans uploaded it in violation of copyright .
Google evokes ambivalent feelings .
Some users now keep their photos , blogs , videos , calendars , e-mail , news feeds , maps , contacts , social networks , documents , spreadsheets , presentations , and credit - card information — in short , much of their lives — on Google 's computers .
And Google has plans to add medical records , location - aware services and much else .
It may even buy radio spectrum in America so that it can offer all these services over wireless - internet connections .
Google could soon , if it wanted , compile dossiers on specific individuals .
This presents “ perhaps the most difficult privacy issues in all of human history , ” says Edward Felten , a privacy expert at Princeton University .
Speaking for many , John Battelle , the author of a book on Google and an early admirer , recently wrote on his blog that “ I 've found myself more and more wary ” of Google “ out of some primal , lizard - brain fear of giving too much control of my data to one source . ”
Google itself has been genuinely taken aback by such sentiments .
The Silicon Valley company , which trumpeted its corporate motto , “ Do n't be evil ” , before its stockmarket listing in 2004 , considers itself a force for good in the world , even in defiance of commercial logic .
Its founders , Larry Page and Sergey Brin , and Eric Schmidt , its chief executive , have said explicitly and repeatedly that their biggest motivation is not to maximise profits but to improve the world .
Too many sermons
Such talk can make outsiders wince .
Book and newspaper publishers , media companies such as Viacom , businesses which depend on Google 's search rankings and a lengthening queue of others are tired of moralising sermons .
Some feel their own livelihoods are threatened and are suing Google .
Even some employees ( called “ Googlers ” ) or former employees ( “ Xooglers ” ) are cynical .
Google is “ arrogant ” because it feels “ invincible ” , says a Xoogler who left to run a start - up firm .
The internal attitude towards customers , rivals and partners is “ you ca n't stop us ” and “ we will crush you ” , he says .
That “ kinder , gentler ” image is “ mythology ” and , he reckons , Google gets away with it only because of its impressively high share price .
That share price has quintupled since 2004 , making Google worth $ 160 billion .
The company has not yet had its tenth birthday .
Yet Piper Jaffray , an investment bank , expects it to have revenues of $ 16 billion and profits of $ 4.3 billion this year .
With so much money pouring in sceptics say it is easy to ignore shareholders and talk about doing good instead of doing well .
But what happens when earnings fall short of Wall Street expectations or some other disaster strikes ?
Yahoo !
and other rivals have gone through such crises and been humbled .
Google has not .
Fifty cents at a time
Google 's success still comes from one main source : the small text ads placed next to its search results and on other web pages .
The advertisers pay only when consumers click on those ads .
“ All that money comes 50 cents at a time , ” says Hal Varian , Google 's chief economist .
For this success to continue , several things need to happen .
First , Google 's share of web searches must remain stable .
Thanks to its brand , this looks manageable .
Google 's share has steadily increased over the years .
It was about 64 % in America in July , according to Hitwise .
That is almost three times the volume of its nearest rival , Yahoo !.
In parts of Europe , India and Latin America , Google 's share is even higher .
Only in South Korea , Japan , China , Russia and the Czech Republic does it trail local incumbents .
Second , Google must maintain or improve the efficiency with which it puts ads next to searches .
And here its dominance is most impressive .
In a recent analysis by Alan Rimm - Kaufman , a marketing consultant , it took a whopping 73 % of the budgets of companies that advertise on search engines ( versus 21 % and 6 % , respectively , for Yahoo ! and Microsoft ) .
It charged more for each click , thanks to its bigger network of advertisers and more competitive online auctions .
And it had far higher “ click - through rates ” , because it made these ads more relevant and useful , so that web users click on them more often .
Perhaps most tellingly , advertisers do better with Google .
Mr Rimm - Kaufman found that Google 's ads “ converted ” more often into actual sales , which tended to be larger than those originating from Yahoo ! or Microsoft .
This is astonishing , given that Yahoo ! has just spent a year on an all - out effort , codenamed Panama , to close precisely these gaps .
But even lucrative “ pay - per- click ” has limits , so Google is moving into other areas .
It is trying ( pending an antitrust inquiry ) to buy DoubleClick , a firm that specialises in the other big online - advertising market , so - called “ branded ” display or banner ads ( for which each view , rather than each click , is charged for ) .
And Google now brokers ads on traditional radio stations , television channels and in newspapers of the dead - tree sort .
Sceptics point out that with each such expansion , Google reduces its profit margins , because it must share more of the revenues with others .
If a web surfer clicks on a text ad placed by Google on a third - party blog , for instance , Google must share the revenue with the blogger .
If Google places ads in newspapers or on radio stations , it must share the revenues with the publisher or broadcaster .
Yet Google does not look at it that way .
Its costs are mostly fixed , so any incremental revenue is profit .
It makes good sense for Google to push into television and other markets , says Mr Varian .
Even if Google gets only one cent for each viewer ( compared with an average of 50 cents for each click on the web ) , that cent carries no variable cost and is thus pure profit .
The machinery that represents the fixed costs is Google 's secret sauce .
Google has built , in effect , the world 's largest supercomputer .
It consists of vast clusters of servers , spread out in enormous datacentres around the world .
The details are Google 's best - guarded secret .
But the result , explains Bill Coughran , a top engineer at Google , is to provide a “ cloud ” of computing power that is flexible enough “ automatically to move load around between datacentres ” .
If , for example , there is unexpected demand for Gmail , Google 's e-mail service , the system instantly allocates more processors and storage to it , without the need for human intervention .
This infrastructure means that Google can launch any new service at negligible cost or risk .
If it fails , fine ; if it succeeds , the cloud makes room for it .
Thus Google can redefine its goals almost on a whim .
Its official strategy recently became “ search , ads , and apps ” — the addition being the apps ( ie , software applications ) .
Sure enough , after a string of acquisitions , Google now offers a complete alternative to Microsoft 's entrenched Office suite of programs , all accessible through any web browser .
A new technology , called Google Gears , will make these applications usable even when there is no internet connection .
And Google is hawking these applications not only to consumers but also to companies .
Ultimately it does so because , thanks to its supercomputer , it can .
With Google 's cashflow and infrastructure , the freedom to do anything it fancies gives rise to constant rumours .
Often , these are outrageous .
It used to be conventional wisdom that Google would build cheap personal computers for poor countries .
This turned out to be nonsense , because Google does not want to make hardware .
Now there is talk of a “ Gphone ” handset .
This is also unlikely because Google is more interested in software and services , and does not want to alienate allies in the handset industry — including Apple , which shares board directors with Google and uses Google software on its iPhone .
Sometimes the rumours are both outrageous and true .
Google is experimenting with new ways of bringing broadband connections to consumers , by blanketing parts of Silicon Valley with Wi -Fi networks .
It is planning to enter an auction for valuable radio spectrum in America , and thinking of radically new business models to make money from wireless data and voice networks , perhaps a free service supported by ads .
If it goes wrong , how ?
Beyond its attempts to expand into new markets , the big question is how Google will respond if its stunning success is interrupted .
“ It 's axiomatic that companies eventually have crises , ” says Mr Schmidt .
And history suggests that “ tech companies that are dominant have trouble from within , not from competitors . ”
In Google 's case , he says , “ I worry about the scaling of the company . ”
Google has been hiring “ Nooglers ” ( new Googlers ) at a breathtaking rate .
In June 2004 it had 2,292 staff ; this June the number had reached 13,786 .
Its ability to get all these people has been a competitive weapon , since Google can afford to hire talent pre-emptively , making it unavailable to Microsoft and Yahoo !.
Google tends to win talent wars because its brand is sexier and its perks are fantastically lavish .
Googlers commute on discreet shuttle buses ( equipped with wireless broadband and running on biodiesel , naturally ) to and from the head office , or “ Googleplex ” , which is a photogenic playground of lava lamps , volleyball courts , swimming pools , free and good restaurants , massage rooms and so forth .
Yet for some on the inside , it can look different .
One former executive , now suing Google over her treatment , says that the firm 's personnel department is “ collapsing ” and that “ absolute chaos ” reigns .
When she was hired , nobody knew when or where she was supposed to work , and the balloons that all Nooglers get delivered to their desks ended up God knows where .
She started receiving detailed e-mails “ enforcing ” Google 's outward informality by reminding her that high heels and jewellery were inappropriate .
Before the corporate ski trip , it was explained that “ if you wear fur , they will kill you . ”
Google is a paradise only for some , she argues .
Employees who predate the IPO resemble aristocracy .
Engineers get the most kudos , people with other functions decidedly less so .
Bright kids just out of college tend to love it , because the Googleplex in effect replaces their university campus — with a dating scene , a laundry service and no reason to leave at weekends .
Older Googlers with families tend to like it less , because “ everybody , even young mums , works seven days a week . ”
Another Xoogler , who held a senior position , says that by trying to create a “ Utopia ” of untrammelled creativity , Google ended up with “ dystopia ” .
As is its wont , Google has composed a rigorous algorithmic approach to hiring , based on grade - point averages , college rankings and endless logic puzzles on whiteboards .
This “ genetic engineering of their workforce , ” he says , means that “ everybody there is a rocket scientist , so everybody is also insecure ” and the back - stabbing and politics are reminiscent of an average university 's English department .
Then there is the question of what all these people are supposed to do .
“ We kind of like the chaos , ” says Laszlo Bock , the personnel boss .
“ Creativity comes out of people bumping into each other and not knowing where to go . ”
The most famous expression of this is the “ 20 % time ” .
In theory , all Googlers , down to receptionists , can spend one - fifth of their time exploring any new idea .
Good stuff has indeed come out of this , including Google News , Gmail , and even those commuter shuttles and their Wi -Fi systems .
But it is not clear that the company as a whole is more innovative as a result , as it claims .
It still has only one proven revenue source and most big innovations , such as YouTube , Google Earth and the productivity applications , have come through acquisitions .
In practice , the 20 % time works out to be 120 % time , says another Xoogler , “ since nobody really gets around to those projects for all their other work . ”
The chances of ideas being executed , he adds , “ are basically zero . ”
What happens to the many Googlers whose ideas are rejected ?
Once their share options are fully vested they consider leaving .
The same phenomenon changed Microsoft in the 1980s , when allegedly T - shirts popped up saying FYIFV ( “ Fuck you , I 'm fully vested ” ) .
Already some are going to even “ cooler ” start - ups , such as Facebook or Twitter .
This week George Reyes , Google 's finance chief , said he would retire .
At 53 , he is a multi-millionaire .
Mr Reyes has maintained the company 's policy of not providing guidance to Wall Street on future earnings , although his comments on growth prospects have moved its share price .
As Nick Leeson was to Barings ...
Besides the slow risk of calcification that comes with growth , there is also the risk that Nooglers will dilute Google 's un-evil values .
Worse , Google might inadvertently pick up a rogue employee , as the late Barings Bank notoriously did with Nick Leeson .
Indeed , Google is fast becoming something like a bank , but one that keeps information rather than money .
This applies equally to its rivals , but Google is accumulating treasure fastest .
Peter Fleischer , Google 's privacy boss , argues that the risk of a malicious or negligent employee leaking or compromising the data , and thus the privacy of users , is minimal because only a “ tiny ” number of engineers have access to the databases and everything they do is recorded .
But the privacy problem is much subtler than that .
As Google compiles more information about individuals , it faces numerous trade - offs .
At one extreme it could use a person 's search history and advertising responses in combination with , say , his location and the itinerary in his calendar , to serve increasingly useful and welcome search results and ads .
This would also allow Google to make money from its many new services .
But it could scare users away .
As a warning , Privacy International , a human - rights watchdog in London , has berated Google , charging that its attitude to privacy “ at its most blatant is hostile , and at its most benign is ambivalent ” .
At the other extreme , Google could decide not to make money from some services — in effect , to provide them as a public benefit — and to destroy data about its users .
This would make its services less useful but also less intrusive and dangerous .
In reality , the balance must be struck somewhere in between .
Messrs Schmidt , Page and Brin have had many meetings on the subject and have made several changes in recent months .
First , says Mr Fleischer , Google has committed itself to “ anonymising ” the search logs on its servers after 18 months — roughly as banks cross out parts of a credit - card number , say .
This would mean that search histories cannot be traced to any specific computer .
Second , Google says that the bits of software called “ cookies ” , which store individual preferences on users ' own computers , will expire every two years .
Not everybody is impressed .
The server logs will still exist for 18 months .
And the cookies of “ active ” users will be automatically renewed upon expiry .
This includes everybody who searches on Google , which in effect means most internet users .
Then there is the matter of all that other information , such as e-mail and documents , that users might keep in Google 's “ cloud ” .
Mr Schmidt points out that such users by definition “ opt in ” , since they log in .
They can opt out at any time .
As things stand today , Google has little to worry about .
Most users continue to google with carefree abandon .
The company faces lawsuits , but those are more of a nuisance than a threat .
It dominates its rivals in the areas that matter , the server cloud is ready for new tasks and the cash keeps flowing .
In such a situation , anybody can claim to be holier than money .
The test comes when the good times end .
At that point , shareholders will demand trade - offs in their favour and consumers might stop believing that Google only ever means well .

FALSE FLAG WATCH : FEARS OF AN ATTACK ON IRAN AND MISTRUST OF VIGILANT SHIELD
A lot of concerns are again heightening that something very negative will soon happen , either domestically , internationally , or both .
OpEdNews itself has seen its share of concerns about Vigilant Shield - 08 , which will be conducted concurrently with Top Officials 4 ( TOPOFF 4 ) , the nation 's premier exercise of terrorism preparedness sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security , plus several other linked exercises as part of the National Level Exercise 1-08 .
These linked exercises will take place from October 15 thru 20 and are being conducted throughout the United States in conjunction with close allies Australia , Canada , and the United Kingdom , as well as the Territory of Guam .
So , quite understandably , there are those who fear that this will morph into something else .
I myself am not overly concerned that something is about to go down in terms of domestic contrived terrorism .
Instead I am actually more concerned that something is about to go down against Iran , especially in the light of an article I just saw about Syria mobilizing for an attack , which I will highlight below .
This follows on the heals of Israel 's fragrant violation of Syria 's sovereignty several weeks ago on bullshit innuendoes in the press that Syria is working on some nuclear whatever , or hiding nuclear whatever for North Korea .
That was a smokescreen in and of itself for something else .
But the neocons are so crazed and desperate now to attack Iran , in a pathetic imitation of Captain Ahab chasing the White Whale , that anything can happen , so that is why I am again raising the Skull and Cross Bones .
Stay aware , aware , aware , and be poised to jump all over whatever lies immediately begin to emanate from the denizens of the dark side across the planet if there is an attack in any form .

THINKING OUTSIDE THE MEDIA BOX :
SIGNIFICANT HYPOTHESIS FROM COMMENTS : OSAMA BIN LADEN IS LONG DEAD ( Nov , 2001 ? OR LATER ? ) ;
Ipso facto , Bin Laden tapes are contrived or doctored , including the newest ones of Sept , 2007 , which have glaring discrepancies that I will address later .
In fact see my lead article in a new series that will study the tapes , entitled Is Osama bin Laden Dead ?

This is my seventh post of a public diary entry entitled " False Flag Watch " that I will run from time to time to do just that , watch for False Flag Operations , or signs and omens thereof , in America and beyond , because there is much concern right now that there are forces at work within the bowels of our own government , or just beyond in its shadow networks , that are , if not actually planning a staged terrorist attack on America , at least praying for one to happen .
These latter " prayers " have actually been duly publicized in the media recently and should be cause for great concern , if for no other reason than the old admonition , " Be careful what you pray for . "
We are also watching for False Flag Ops beyond America 's borders that are designed to strongly impact foreign and domestic policy .
Note as well that False Flag Operations have an ugly history as covert and deceitful tools of governments to achieve less than noble aims , so I am not hallucinating here .
False Flag
Ops go all the way back to Emperor Nero framing the Christians for the Great Fire of Rome and beyond , wherever and whenever a State or other political body practiced deceit to manipulate its citizens at the expense of some poor scapegoat .

This is an excerpt from an article just recently posted by DEBKAfile ( http://www.debka.com/ ) , an Israeli security and intelligence focused journal , which we must however take with a big grain of salt , because the Israelis are trapped in their own peculiar version of reality , and Mossad is given to planting false information all the time .
Even so , this article indicates that Syria is concerned about an attack .
DEBKAfile Exclusive : Syrian Civil Defense Services Placed on the Ready
October 12 , 2007 , 12:50 AM ( GMT+02:00 )
Our military sources report exclusively that Thursday night , Oct. 11 , Syria placed its civil defense services on a state of preparedness and mobilized their reservists .
Government and military hospitals across Syria have also been alerted .
These measures were ordered Tuesday , Oct. 9 , and were in place within three days .
In contrast , there is no change in the deployment of Syrian forces along the border with Israel on Golan and Mt. Hermon .
Thursday , Syrian defense minister Gen. Hassan Turkmani published a message to the armed forces calling for " readiness to withstand all aggression . "
.... All these measures and this rhetoric strongly indicate the Syrian regime is convinced that either an American or Israeli assault , or attacks by both against Syria and Iran are due shortly .
Assad went on to say to the Tunisian interviewer :
This means we are facing a force ( the Americans ) which has no respect for international laws and values , exactly as in Iraq .
The United States , " he continued , " backs the enemy Israel absolutely which prevents us from perceiving the US in any other light than an enemy . "
An attack on Iran will harm the whole world but as we have seen in the Iraq War , the Americans do not enter into such calculations .
" I cannot play games of anticipation , " said the Syrian ruler .
" I must be ready for any US or Israeli operation against Iran or Syria . "

Make what you will of this , but to say the least , the world is in a very precarious state , where the added tension and paranoia lend themselves to manifesting an incident by accident or misfortune .
Not a good situation at all .
STAY AWARE .
Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini Monday confirmed the company plans to build a $ 2.5 billion chip plant in China .
The plant , to be built in Dalian , on China 's northeastern coast , will enter production during the first half of 2010 .
Intel hopes the Dalian plant , which will be used to initially produce chipsets , and not the company 's flagship microprocessors , will help drive down manufacturing costs .
" One of the things we want to learn in China is how to do very low - cost manufacturing , " Otellini said during a press conference in Beijing , which was carried live over the Internet by Chinese media .
Incentives from China
While China has lower labor costs than the U.S. or other developed countries , this is only a fraction of the cost involved in building a chip plant .
Most of the costs involved with building such a plant come with the expensive machinery and equipment required to manufacture chips .
These capital expenditure costs are generally the same around the world , Otellini said , indicating that financial incentives and support from the Chinese government played a major role in the company 's decision .
Intel 's goal is to take advantage of these incentives and then run the plant at maximum efficiency to get the lowest manufacturing costs , said company spokesman Chuck Mulloy .
Construction in 2007
Construction on the new Dalian plant , called Fab 68 , will begin later this year and is billed as the largest single investment by a foreign company in northeastern China , an area hit hard by the decline of the country 's state - owned heavy industries over the last decade .
The impact of this decline has been less severe in Dalian , which is home to a thriving software and outsourcing industry .
The widely anticipated announcement of the Dalian plant is a coup for the Chinese government , which spent years pushing Intel 's top executives to set up a manufacturing plant in China as part of wider plans to make the country a semiconductor manufacturing center .
Despite the fanfare , Intel 's planned Dalian plant will not be among the company 's most advanced when it enters production .
Intel now has an export license from the U.S. government to use 90 - nanometer process technology at the plant in 2009 .
As process technology advances , Intel will have a strong case to obtain a license to use 65 - nanometer process technology at the Dalian plant when it enters production in 2010 .
The U.S. government carefully regulates the transfer of semiconductor technology to China and other countries because of concerns the technology can be used for military purposes .
I ran across this recently :
“ In fact the problem of ‘ boilerplate design pattern code ’ says nothing about the quality of the language ; it says only that the programmer are working at the wrong level of abstraction and are the victims of that all too common sickness : bad design .
Picking another language is not the cure for this disease .
( More than likely it ’s only going to make things worse ! ) ”
This is just plain wrong– except for the part about the programmer working at the wrong level of abstraction and being a victim of “ bad design . ”
The question is , how much of that has been foisted onto the programmer by the design of the language he ’s writing in ?
And if much of it is due to the language , then it ’s certainly not off base to go shopping for a new one !
If you ’re not clear on this issue , then you need to watch SICP Lecture 3a : Henderson Escher Example .
Early in the lecture ( 00:05:45 ) he points out the importance of closure in any means of combination in a programming language .
( Now this is n’t about “ closures ” , now … this is a more general mathematical principle . )
Anyways , Abelson says , “ Closure was the thing that allowed us to start building up complexity … .
The things that we make … those things themselves can be combined …. to make more complicated things … .
When you look at a means of combination , you should be asking yourself whether things are closed under that means of combination . ”
Obviously , it ’s much better to be able to make an array of arrays than it is to be restricted to only storing numbers or strings in them .
Whenever the principle of closure is violated , you ’re going to be limited in your ability to formulate useful abstractions .
Just like you lose the ability to express certain ideas cleanly ( or even at all ) when functions are anything other than first class citizens in your programming language .
Programming languages really do have significant differences ; they ’re not all the same .
After going through his example step by step ( and incorporating everything covered so far in the course ) , he ( 01:02:37 ) sums up why the ability to create embedded languages is so important : “ That ’s the important point : the difference between merely implementing something in a language and embedding something in a language so that you do n’t lose the original power of the language .
Lisp is a lousy language for doing any particular problem ; what it ’s good for is figuring out the right language that you want and embedding that in Lisp .
That ’s the real power to this approach to design . ”
I think a lot of people get the heeby jeebies when they hear Lisp programmers talking about creating new languages to solve problems .
They ’re thinking , “ if people start writing their own macros , how will I understand the code when I have to maintain it ? ! ”
Well , yeah .
That ’s only going to be a problem if you do n’t know how to use macroexpand to show what ’s going on “ under the hood . ”
But when you look at what ’s going on in the example from the video , you can see that the process of implementing languages to describe what ’s going on actually makes the code much easier to understand .
The languages are implemented at each level of abstraction .
Each language does n’t “ care ” how the lower level languages are actually implemented – you can think at each level in terms of that level without being confused by unnecessary detail .
And each level can be manipulated with and integrated with all of the usual idioms of the Lisp language itself .
It ’s not like you ’re randomly inventing a new Python or Perl depending on the problem you ’re solving .
You ’re making languages that are fully embedded in Lisp … and there ’s nothing keeping you from utilizing other Lisp tools , techniques , and elements with these language layers .
So do n’t let all the talk about DSL ’s and embedded languages scare you .
Expressive code can actually be easier to understand , extend and maintain .

I learned this little lesson from a couple of Washington , D.C. drag queens back in my plus - size modeling days .
What you will need
duct tape
scissors
a towel / or sweater
breasts
First , and I cannot stress this enough .
You must use your own rack .
Barring that , use that of a willing friend .
The best taped plans gang aft a - gley , as our friend Bobby Burns would say , when you try to lift and separate a stranger ’s sweatermeat .
Secondly , unless you want your “ crowning glories ” to pop off like pen caps ( is that creepy sounding ?
That ’s creepy sounding right ?
I ’m just trying to be delicate , but I guess that horse left the barn with sweatermeat . ) you ’ll need a nice fuzzy towel or sweater .
You need the fuzzy sweater or towel to reduce the adhesive properties of the duct tape .
If you forget to do this , it will End Badly and you will probably die .
Also , you should probably stretch first .
Tear two pieces of duct tape long enough to wrap across your torso from side to side .
Place them sticky side down on the towel .
These are the foundations of your foundation garment .
Tear two pieces of duct tape long enough to stretch from the underarm to the middle of the chest .
These are your “ underwires . ”
Tear each piece lengthwise so you will have four thin strips .
Put those on the towel as well .
The assembly of the bra is more art than science , so you may have to winnie around a bit , but here are the general rules of application .
Leaning forward , place one of the long strips along your torso just under the bust line .
This should give a bit of a heave to the whole bosom area .
If you are applying the tape from the left to the right , lean a bit to the right and then to the left so that the gals are arranged for maximum cleave and minimum splooshy back fat .
Leaning forward and a bit to the left , apply one of the thin strips in a curve from under your arm –where your underwire would go– and pull snugly until the mammary in question is more or less where you feel it ought to be .
Repeat for the right .
Apply the second long strip across your torso over and slightly above the first and add the final “ underwire ” strips in the same method as the first .
This might take a bit of fiddling , and as always , your cleavage may vary .
If you ’ve got a hard to wrangle rack you may end up using more tape , although , for structural integrity , I would not suggest using less .
To remove : hold the skin taut and peel back .
It ’s really not painful , as long as you remember to use that towel .
Alternatively , take a shower .
Have fun , but be responsible !
Oh , and there ’s no use asking for a photo essay or diagram .
I ’m hopeless with a sketch pad and my dog ca n’t work a digital camera .
On Thursday , the corporate media turned out in impressive numbers to cover the pro-justice march in Jena , Louisiana .
But last Saturday , just five days before , that same corporate media barely addressed the anti-war march in Washington DC .
Personally , I 'm thrilled the mainstream corporate media covered Jena , but I 'm not delusional as to WHY :
For the Bush - crony corporate media , which owns profitable " defense " industry businesses and serves the military industrial complex in myriad ways , the march in Jena was viable to promote .
It served the interests of both the Bush administration and American media corporations by providing a global view of Bush 's exportable democracy .
Unlike the anti-war movement that directly targets George Bush and Dick Cheney , the Jena march targeted local officials and local injustice .
It never mentioned George W. Bush or his administration .
Thus , the Jena march was covered and the anti-war march was not .
Furthermore , if Bush put a media kibosh on the Jena march the way he does on anti-war marches , he would ensure an even greater divide between Black Americans , the Republican party and his administration .
Activists know the success of public demonstration is judged by the attention it gets .
If the Jena march generates media attention , the march is deemed a success .
If the Republicans and George Bush want to keep any faith with Black Americans , they had better let the media do its work .
Plus , on the heels of the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina , where the world watched America 's disenfranchised Black population purposely forsaken , what better promo for Bush 's portrait of transferrable global democracy than a media barrage showing Black Americans free to congregate , chant and march ?
The fact is , if Bush and the corporations had n't approved the media coverage in Jena and recognized how they could personally benefit from it , it would never have taken place .
But since these same media conglomerates also profit from the military industrial complex , the coverage of Jena was a win all around .
If Bush and the corporations can show that democracy works , they can argue it 's worth exporting , and they are noble for passing it on - regardless of the cost !
YEAH , RIGHT ??!!
Thursday 's march in Jena broadcast to the world that Americans have freedom of discourse .
However , the extent of Jena 's coverage was predicated on the subjects the discourse was on .
Since the marchers did n't demonstrate against the government , the media or the President , the exposure was high .
Had they taken on the government , the media or the President , the exposure would have been little to none .
So much for the beatitude of Bush 's exportable democracy .
In truth , it was great to SEE Jena 's streets filled to capacity for civil rights .
And great to SEE the media converge to report it .
Unfortunately , the reporting was more for " photo - ops " than to advance the marchers ' cause .
This was corporate media 's opportunity to transmit exportable democracy to every corner of the globe .
After all , one can't export democracy if one can't show the world it exists .
It will be interesting to see how long corporate media broadcasts the Jena story .
Likely just as long as the focus stays off Bush , Cheney and Washington , DC .
Despite the media 's questionable motives for covering the events in Jena , I 'm ecstatic that they did .
The injustice served upon the young Jena Six , upon young Genarlow Wilson and Troy Davis in Georgia , and upon THOUSANDS of young black men trapped in America 's prison industrial complex , is reprehensible .
IT MUST STOP !!
My great hope is that this is the beginning of a new civil rights movement that I become part of .
In all my years in the social justice movement , my biggest regret was never marching with Dr. King .
But I could n't .
In 1963 I was fourteen years old and not permitted to go .
Now forty - four years later I had to pass on Jena , too , having just returned from Washington where I 'd marched against the war .
Of course the media was barely there .
On September 15th , I , along with 100,000 kindred activists , marched through the nation 's capitol where we were pretty much ignored .
The minimal media we did get was distorted and untrue .
When a small , sadistic band of war - hawks showed up to oppose us , the press slanted their numbers as if they equalled our own .
The truth is , their numbers were ONE 100TH the size of ours , although one would never know that from this deceptive headline in The Washington Post : " Dueling Demonstrations . "
It 's a travesty that mainstream journalists ignore the anti-war movement and serve their corporate masters to the detriment of our nation .
Of course , there are no photo - ops at peace marches to support the export of Bush 's democracy .
There is only the truth which apparently is n't enough .
It 's sad .
During the extensive coverage of Jena on Thursday , CNN's Kyra Phillips was so bubbled over by her freedom to report that she blurted out on camera , " this is what we went to journalism school for - to do stories like this . "
On that point Ms. Phillips is correct .
She did learn in journalism school that there is honor in her profession .
She also learned in journalism school that the only master she serves is THE TRUTH .
Not her corporate bosses .
If Ms. Phillips and her colleagues choose to report on the truth , the anti-war movement is an excellent source .
In fact , here 's a small sampling of some stories she could have told from the peace march on September 15th :
* On the eve of the September 15th PEACE march , several members of the Rolling Thunder and Gathering of Eagles Pro-War / Pro-Violence motorcycle gangs showed up at the CODEPINK House in Washington , DC to harass the peace loving WOMEN in pink .
It was an unconscionable bullying act .
CODEPINK diffused the encounter and engaged them in peaceful conversation .
I was staying at the House at the time .
* During Saturday 's PEACE march , a six - foot - tall pro-war / pro-violence male agitator slapped CODEPINK 's 23 - year - old staffer , Alexandra , across HER face when she tried to intercede in an argument .
Fortunately , the cowardly attacker was hauled off and arrested by the Capitol Police .
I saw the bruise on Ally ''s left cheek .
I hope the attacker is appropriately punished .
* One of the cowardly members of the Rolling Thunder and Gathering of Eagles Pro-War / Pro-Violence motorcycle gangs approached CODEPINK women during the march with a knife and slashed the giant PEACE banners they were holding .
AND THE STORY THAT REALLY MUST BE TOLD :
* Several cowardly members of the Rolling Thunder and Gathering of Eagles Pro-War / Pro-Violence motorcycle gangs BEAT AND KICKED GoldStar father Carlos Arredondo during the peace march .
They beat Carlos so badly that he had deep cuts and bruises all over his body .
For those who may not know Carlos Arredondo , he is the grieving father who set fire to himself when told his Marine son Alex was killed in Iraq .
( http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060508/richards ) I saw Carlos ' wounds .
They were deep , bloody and painful , but no where near as painful as the pain from losing his child !
SHAME ON A GATHERING OF EAGLES AND ROLLING THUNDER !!
SHAME ON THE CORPORATE MEDIA !
SHAME ON GEORGE W. BUSH !
Final note :
The corporate media 's exploitation of the " Jena Six " has given the story the renown it deserves .
It 's the dawning of a renewed and needed movement .
As one who protested the Vietnam war , I remember what it was like to link arms in a multi-cultural rainbow and march in lockstep toward peace .
I 've long wished for greater diversity in the current peace movement .
But with the economic hard times Americans are facing , coupled with legitimate fear of imprisonment , it 's not surprising the representation of Black Americans has been small .
Nonetheless , in the United States Congress , the strongest anti-Iraq war voice belongs to Congresswoman Maxine Waters who marched in Jena this week .
As Congresswoman Waters clearly knows , at the core of America 's economic problems is the ever - growing cost of war .
It is my hope that millions more Americans will join this revitalized civil rights movement AND the peace movement .
It is my further hope or DREAM that the two will merge into one powerful force to take on illegal war , American imperialism , racial injustice , the prison industrial complex , poverty , health - care and the multitude of ills that plague our nation and our world .
When we are that powerful , the corporate media and the administration can't afford to turn away .
What is Stevia ?
If you ’ve ever tasted stevia , you know it ’s extremely sweet .
In fact , this remarkable noncaloric herb , native to Paraguay , has been used as a sweetener and flavor enhancer for centuries .
But this innocuous - looking plant has also been a focal point of intrigue in the United States in recent years because of actions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
The subject of searches and seizures , trade complaints and embargoes on importation , stevia has been handled at times by the FDA as if it were an illegal drug .
Since the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act ( DSHEA ) , stevia can be sold legally in the United States , but only as a “ dietary supplement . ”
Even so , it can be found in many forms in most health - food stores , and is also incorporated into drinks , teas and other items ( all labeled as “ dietary supplements ” ) .
It cannot , however , be called a “ sweetener ” or even referred to as “ sweet . ”
To do so would render the product “ adulterated , ” according to the FDA , and make it again subject to seizure .
The purpose of this site is to provide as much information about stevia as possible , from the scientific studies regarding its safety to the petitions submitted by the Lipton Tea Company and the American Herbal Products Association .

BBC News , Washington
The Dalai Lama is someone who wants peace , Mr Bush says
The meeting will be in Washington on Tuesday , a day before the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader is due to receive the Congressional Medal .
China has already objected to honouring a man it regards as a leader of a separatist state .
China now governs Tibet , which the Dalai Lama fled in 1959 following a failed uprising .
Highest honour
While the White House is playing down the significance of the Dalai Lama 's latest private meeting with President Bush , the timing is likely to add fuel to the diplomatic flames .
A spokesman for the Chinese government said that the Beijing authorities resolutely opposed what he referred to as a Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama .
The spokesman said China was opposed to any country or person using the Dalai Lama issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs .
The Bush administration has already announced that the president and his wife , Laura , will attend Wednesday 's Capitol Hill ceremony , in which the Dalai Lama will be honoured with the highest civilian Congressional award .
It is thought this will be the first time that a sitting US president has appeared with the Dalai Lama at a public event .
The White House press secretary said that Mr Bush understood the Chinese would have concerns , but that he hoped the Chinese leaders would get to know that the Dalai Lama was someone who wants peace .
OiNK Founder Will Be in Really Big Trouble — Just As Soon As Police Figure Out What He ’s Done Wrong

Twenty - four - year - old OiNK founder Alan Ellis , who was arrested on suspicion of “ conspiracy to defraud and copyright infringement ” Tuesday following a raid on his much - loved BitTorrent site , has been released from police custody with no charges filed .
Now he ’s back and chatting online about his detainment :
“ The police had very limited technical knowledge , which made the interview quite amusing actually .
I was n’t willing to teach them how to use a computer .
They actually wanted me to teach them how to set up a website .
I just told them to Google it . ”
Ellis says the earliest his case could go to trial is December 26 , though he notes that this is unlikely .
One thing is for sure , though :
By the time police and the record industry figure out what to charge him with , someone will definitely have invented an easier , more efficient , less traceable way to steal music .

OiNK Founder Will Be in Really Big Trouble — Just As Soon As Police Figure Out What He ’s Done Wrong
PBS Frontline 's " Spying on the Home Front " last night was downright chilling .
Although there were no major blockbuster revelations , they painted a very clear and complete picture of the Bush administration 's vastly expanded domestic surveillance programs and their impact on civil liberties .
This clip shows how Alberto Gonzales was very careful during his Senate testimony on the NSA warrantless wiretapping program exposed by the New York Times in December 2005 .
On numerous occasions he made it abundantly clear that he was only testifying on that specific program , which leads one to conclude that there are likely other ( and more intrusive ) domestic spying programs in place .
Indeed , when Sen. Feinstein asks him if there are any other programs , he literally says " I do n't know how to answer that . "

In case you missed it , I highly recommend watching the entire thing on the PBS website .
This is by far the most comprehensive report to date on the extent and severity of the Bush administration 's post - 9/11 domestic surveillance activities .
See how much the landscape of the lake has changed
Enlarge Image
Park rangers who patrolled the area in the Magallanes region in March reported that the two - hectare ( five - acre ) glacial lake was its normal size .
But two months later they found a huge dry crater and stranded chunks of ice that previously floated on the water .
Experts now say melting glaciers put pressure on an ice wall that acted as a dam , causing it to give way .
Water in the lake flowed out of the breach into a nearby fjord and then out to the sea , said Andres Rivera , a glaciologist with Chile 's Centre of Scientific Studies .
Melting ice
Mr Rivera flew on Monday in a navy airplane to take hundreds of photographs of the site , which is some 2,000 km ( 1,250 miles ) south of the capital , Santiago .
" On one side of the Bernardo glacier one can see a large hole or gap , and we believe that 's where the water flowed through , " Mr Rivera said in a navy communique .
" This confirms that glaciers in the region are retreating and getting thinner . "
He noted that the lake now appears to be filling up again , probably because of the melting of slabs of ice left on the lake bed .
The advance and retreat of glaciers is part of the normal dynamic of the Patagonian region but climate change was distorting the process , Mr Rivera said .
" This would not be happening if the temperature had not increased , " he added .

This article discusses how to synchronize access to shared resources , and otherwise coordinate execution of threads .
Synchronizing Access to Shared Resources #
One important issue when using threads is to avoid conflicts when more than one thread needs to access a single variable or other resource .
If you ’re not careful , overlapping accesses or modifications from multiple threads may cause all kinds of problems , and what ’s worse , those problems have a tendency of appearing only under heavy load , or on your production servers , or on some faster hardware that ’s only used by one of your customers .
For example , consider a program that does some kind of processing , and keeps track of how many items it has processed :
counter = 0 def process_item ( item ) : global counter ... do something with item ... counter += 1
If you call this function from more than one thread , you ’ll find that the counter is n’t necessarily accurate .
It works in most cases , but sometimes misses one or more items .
The reason for this is that the increment operation is actually executed in three steps ; first , the interpreter fetches the current value of the counter , then it calculates the new value , and finally , it writes the new value back to the variable .
If another thread gets control after the current thread has fetched the variable , it may fetch the variable , increment it , and write it back , before the current thread does the same thing .
And since they ’re both seeing the same original value , only one item will be accounted for .
Another common problem is access to incomplete or inconsistent state , which can happen if one thread is initializing or updating some non-trivial data structure , and another thread attempts to read the structure while it ’s being updated .
Atomic Operations #
The simplest way to synchronize access to shared variables or other resources is to rely on atomic operations in the interpreter .
An atomic operation is an operation that is carried out in a single execution step , without any chance that another thread gets control .
In general , this approach only works if the shared resource consists of a single instance of a core data type , such as a string variable , a number , or a list or dictionary .
Here are some thread - safe operations :
reading or replacing a single instance attribute
reading or replacing a single global variable
fetching an item from a list
modifying a list in place ( e.g. adding an item using append )
) fetching an item from a dictionary
modifying a dictionary in place ( e.g. adding an item , or calling the clear method )
Note that as mentioned earlier , operations that read a variable or attribute , modifies it , and then writes it back are not thread - safe .
Another thread may update the variable after it ’s been read by the current thread , but before it ’s been updated .
Also note that Python code may be executed when objects are destroyed , so even seemingly simple operations may cause other threads to run , and may thus cause conflicts .
When in doubt , use explicit locks .
Locks are the most fundamental synchronization mechanism provided by the threading module .
At any time , a lock can be held by a single thread , or by no thread at all .
If a thread attempts to hold a lock that ’s already held by some other thread , execution of the first thread is halted until the lock is released .
Locks are typically used to synchronize access to a shared resource .
For each shared resource , create a Lock object .
When you need to access the resource , call acquire to hold the lock ( this will wait for the lock to be released , if necessary ) , and call release to release it :
lock = Lock ( ) lock.acquire ( ) ... access shared resource lock .
release ( )
For proper operation , it ’s important to release the lock even if something goes wrong when accessing the resource .
You can use try - finally for this purpose :
lock.acquire ( ) try : ... access shared resource finally : lock.release ( )
In Python 2.5 and later , you can also use the with statement .
When used with a lock , this statement automatically acquires the lock before entering the block , and releases it when leaving the block :
from __future__ import with_statement with lock : ... access shared resource
The acquire method takes an optional wait flag , which can be used to avoid blocking if the lock is held by someone else .
If you pass in False , the method never blocks , but returns False if the lock was already held :
if not lock.acquire ( False ) : ... failed to lock the resource else : try : ... access shared resource finally : lock.release ( )
You can use the locked method to check if the lock is held .
Note that you cannot use this method to determine if a call to acquire would block or not ; some other thread may have acquired the lock between the method call and the next statement .
if not lock .locked ( ) : lock.acquire ( )
Problems with Simple Locking #
The standard lock object does n’t care which thread is currently holding the lock ; if the lock is held , any thread that attempts to acquire the lock will block , even if the same thread is already holding the lock .
Consider the following example :
lock = threading .
Lock ( ) def get_first_part ( ) : lock.acquire ( ) try : ... fetch data for first part from shared object finally : lock.release ( ) return data def get_second_part ( ) : lock.acquire ( ) try : ... fetch data for second part from shared object finally : lock.release ( ) return data
Here , we have a shared resource , and two access functions that fetch different parts from the resource .
The access functions both use locking to make sure that no other thread can modify the resource while we ’re accessing it .
Now , if we want to add a third function that fetches both parts , we quickly get into trouble .
The naive approach is to simply call the two functions , and return the combined result :
def get_both_parts ( ) : first = get_first_part ( ) second = get_second_part ( ) return first , second
The problem here is that if some other thread modifies the resource between the two calls , we may end up with inconsistent data .
The obvious solution to this is to grab the lock in this function as well :
def get_both_parts ( ) : lock.acquire( ) try : first = get_first_part ( ) second = get_second_part ( ) finally : lock.release ( ) return first , second
However , this wo n’t work ; the individual access functions will get stuck , because the outer function already holds the lock .
To work around this , you can add flags to the access functions that enables the outer function to disable locking , but this is error - prone , and can quickly get out of hand .
Fortunately , the threading module contains a more practical lock implementation ; re-entrant locks .
The RLock class is a version of simple locking that only blocks if the lock is held by another thread .
While simple locks will block if the same thread attempts to acquire the same lock twice , a re-entrant lock only blocks if another thread currently holds the lock .
If the current thread is trying to acquire a lock that it ’s already holding , execution continues as usual .
lock = threading .
Lock ( ) lock.acquire( ) lock.acquire ( ) lock = threading .
RLock ( ) lock.acquire( ) lock.acquire ( )
The main use for this is nested access to shared resources , as illustrated by the example in the previous section .
To fix the access methods in that example , just replace the simple lock with a re-entrant lock , and the nested calls will work just fine .
lock = threading .
RLock ( ) def get_first_part ( ) : ... see above def get_second_part ( ) : ... see above def get_both_parts ( ) : ... see above
With this in place , you can fetch either the individual parts , or both parts at once , without getting stuck or getting inconsistent data .
Note that this lock keeps track of the recursion level , so you still need to call release once for each call to acquire .
A semaphore is a more advanced lock mechanism .
A semaphore has an internal counter rather than a lock flag , and it only blocks if more than a given number of threads have attempted to hold the semaphore .
Depending on how the semaphore is initialized , this allows multiple threads to access the same code section simultaneously .
semaphore = threading .BoundedSemaphore( ) semaphore.acquire ( ) ... access the shared resource semaphore .
release ( )
The counter is decremented when the semaphore is acquired , and incremented when the semaphore is released .
If the counter reaches zero when acquired , the acquiring thread will block .
When the semaphore is incremented again , one of the blocking threads ( if any ) will run .
Semaphores are typically used to limit access to resource with limited capacity , such as a network connection or a database server .
Just initialize the counter to the maximum number , and the semaphore implementation will take care of the rest .
max_connections = 10 semaphore = threading .BoundedSemaphore( max_connections )
If you do n’t pass in a value , the counter is initialized to 1 .
Python ’s threading module provides two semaphore implementations ; the Semaphore class provides an unlimited semaphore which allows you to call release any number of times to increment the counter .
To avoid simple programming errors , it ’s usually better to use the BoundedSemaphore class , which considers it to be an error to call release more often than you ’ve called acquire .
Synchronization Between Threads #
Locks can also be used for synchronization between threads .
The threading module contains several classes designed for this purpose .
An event is a simple synchronization object ; the event represents an internal flag , and threads can wait for the flag to be set , or set or clear the flag themselves .
event = threading .
Event ( ) event.wait ( ) event.set ( ) event.clear ( )
If the flag is set , the wait method does n’t do anything .
If the flag is cleared , wait will block until it becomes set again .
Any number of threads may wait for the same event .
A condition is a more advanced version of the event object .
A condition represents some kind of state change in the application , and a thread can wait for a given condition , or signal that the condition has happened .
Here ’s a simple consumer / producer example .
First , you need a condition object :
condition = threading .
Condition ( )
The producing thread needs to acquire the condition before it can notify the consumers that a new item is available :
... generate item condition.acquire ( ) ... add item to resource condition.notify ( ) condition .release ( )
The consumers must acquire the condition ( and thus the related lock ) , and can then attempt to fetch items from the resource :
condition.acquire ( ) while True : ... get item from resource if item : break condition.wait ( ) condition.release ( ) ... process item
The wait method releases the lock , blocks the current thread until another thread calls notify or notifyAll on the same condition , and then reacquires the lock .
If multiple threads are waiting , the notify method only wakes up one of the threads , while notifyAll always wakes them all up .
To avoid blocking in wait , you can pass in a timeout value , as a floating - point value in seconds .
If given , the method will return after the given time , even if notify has n’t been called .
If you use a timeout , you must inspect the resource to see if something actually happened .
Note that the condition object is associated with a lock , and that lock must be held before you can access the condition .
Likewise , the condition lock must be released when you ’re done accessing the condition .
In production code , you should use try - finally or with , as shown earlier .
To associate the condition with an existing lock , pass the lock to the Condition constructor .
This is also useful if you want to use several conditions for a single resource :
lock = threading .
RLock ( ) condition_1 = threading .
Condition ( lock ) condition_2 = threading .
Condition ( lock )

Clicking on the ad will take you to Manix 's website . . .
Can you might appreciate the subtlety of this ad , done by a Brazilian agency , for a lubricating gel ( K - Y equivalent ) targeting the French market ?
It appears the Brazilians were trying to come up with an ad that was neither offensive nor tasteless .
The picture looks completely innocent ... until the details sink in .
Apparently , this ad has created quite a buzz in Europe .
The ad company has won several awards for it , including 18th Annual London International Advertising Awards and the LEAFyear2 Awards Ceremony announced at the Galveias Palace in Lisbon , Portugal .
( See the ad agency Ansell for more details ) .
If you do n't get it , take your time .
All I can say ( as a hint ) , apparently , the stuff really works .

Chertoff Explains ' Gut Feeling ' About Terror Attack
There 's no " specific intelligence , " but " this threat is very alive , " he said .
July 11 , 2007  -- Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has downplayed comments he made Tuesday on the U.S. terror situation .
" We do n't have specific intelligence about an attack , that is , a particular attack against the homeland , that is imminent or scheduled for the summer , " he told ABC News .
Chertoff noted , " It 's important as we go into the summer season , which is typically a time people like to relax , to remind people that this threat is very alive , and the enemy is continuing to try to improve itself and carry out its attacks . "
In a Tuesday meeting with the Chicago Tribune 's editorial board , Chertoff said he believes " we are entering a period this summer of increased risk . "
But his explanation for that assessment — " a gut feeling " based on past terrorist patterns — prompted a flurry of questions about what the secretary might know .
Chertoff indicated to the Tribune that the assessment is " not of a specific threat , but of increased vulnerability , " but the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee sent Chertoff a letter today , asking him to " clarify your comments by providing concrete direction " to Congress and law enforcement agencies .
" What color code in the Homeland Security advisory system is associated with a ' gut feeling ? ' " asked Rep. Bennie Thompson , D - Miss .
" What sectors should be on alert as a result of your ' gut feeling ' ?
What cities should be asking their law enforcement to work double shifts because of your ' gut feeling , ' " Thompson asked .
" Are the American people supposed to purchase duct tape and plastic sheeting because of your ' gut feeling ? ' "
After authorities in the U.K. thwarted terror plots in London and Glasgow last week , Chertoff said he had seen " no specific , credible information suggesting that this incident is connected to a threat to the homeland . "
He also said there were no plans to change the U.S. terror threat level , which currently stands at yellow , or elevated .
But ABC
News has reported that an increased number of law enforcement and intelligence officials are concerned that al Qaeda or other extremist groups are ramping up efforts to carry out attacks on targets in Europe , North Africa , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Intelligence officials say some of those groups have been at training camps in remote tribal area locations of Pakistan — the same regions that might be home to senior al Qaeda leaders in hiding .
Sources have also told ABC News that recent intelligence points to a pattern of large groups of Islamic radicals flowing into terrorist camps in Pakistan for training , then leaving for unknown destination countries .
That training push , government officials believe , is hard evidence that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on targets around the globe .
The problem , they say , is that details on the when , where and how of the attacks are sketchy .
But Chertoff said his department is maintaining focus .
" We respond promptly to any information , any intelligence , " Chertoff told ABC News .
" If we have something specific to tell the public or to communicate to local officials , we do it promptly and immediately . "
" But as it stands now , we 're looking at a general situation , and we do n't have specific threat information , " Chertoff added .
" But that does n't mean that we 're not going to watch it and that tomorrow , or next week , or in two weeks , something new might not arise . "
Many Americans ( including many of my friends ) are conditioned by many years of marketing to select name brand products at the store .
They ’ll skip right by the generic rice puffs and buy the identical Rice Krispies for a dollar more per box .
They ’ll skip by the 100 % store brand juice and pick up Juicy Juice , the same thing with a fifty cent markup .
It ’s completely understandable that people wish to choose the product they ’re most familiar with , but it ’s also an expensive choice in many cases .
Generics are often prepared identically to name - brand products or are only slight variations on the name brand , but the cost is far less .
Why ?
Advertising – with the name brand , you have to support the company ’s marketing budget as well .
Yet , for many , there still remains a certain “ taboo ” about buying generics .
If you feel that way , I encourage you to try the following things the next time you ’re at the grocery store .
Find the “ generic ” parallel for some of your purchases .
Many canned products , breakfast cereals , and so on have generic forms that are very similar .
Quite often , people rush through the store and grab the name brand on instinct without actually bothering to find the generic item .
Compare the ingredients in the generic and the name brand .
I was shocked when I first did this – many times , the ingredients in the two are identical – no difference at all .
In a few cases , the generic was more healthy – it would have the same ingredients , but in a different order , indicating a smaller proportion of high fructose corn syrup , for example .
If there is a noticeable difference , decide whether the cost difference is worth it .
Quite often , you ’ll find the generic ’s ingredients are just fine compared to the name brand one , even if there are some differences .
For example , you might find that the name brand tomato paste has no salt in it , while the generic has a tiny amount of sodium in it .
Is it worth $ 0.50 for that difference ?
If it brings comfort to you , use the non-generic packaging at home .
Something my mother used to do to reduce complaints in the morning is put generic cereal in the name brand box .
I did n’t realize this for years , but if I did n’t actually witness my mother buying the cereal at the store , it was usually the generic form in the name brand box .
For most purchases , I buy the store brand – there are very few name brands that I purchase over the store brand , and the only reason I do in those cases is that I ’ve tried both and the name brand has enough of a quality difference to make it worthwhile ( diapers come to mind here ) .
I also put in an effort to pore through the ads for the store and also the Sunday coupons to see if I can get a deal on the name brand that ’s even cheaper than the generic – and it happens more often than you might think .
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Discovery Channel is re-evaluating one of its most popular series , “ Man vs. Wild , ” after allegations surfaced that its survival - expert host was bunking in motels when he was supposed to be braving the great outdoors .
The network issued a statement Monday in response to an investigation launched by British television network Channel 4 , which carries the program under the title “ Born Survivor : Bear Grylls . ”
Channel 4 confirmed that host Bear Grylls had partaken of indoor accommodations on at least two occasions when his series had depicted him spending the night in the wild .
“ Discovery Communications has learned that isolated elements of the ‘ Man vs. Wild ’ show in some episodes were not natural to the environment , and that for health and safety concerns the crew and host received some survival assistance while in the field , ” the network said in a statement .
The production company behind the series , Diverse Television , is cooperating with the Channel 4 investigation , which likely will address a range of allegations that called into question “ Wild ’s ” authenticity .
In each episode of the series , Grylls is airlifted into the wilderness with only a few tools to aid in his survival , such as a flint or water bottle .
A former British special forces soldier , Grylls is typically depicted as subsisting for several days without intervention or interruption while cameramen follow him offscreen .
He has been stranded all over the globe , including Utah ’s Moab desert and the Costa Rican rain forest .
But among the charges made against Grylls is that a raft he is depicted as having built himself actually was constructed and then disassembled by consultants to the show in order for the host to put it together .
In another episode , Grylls happens upon what are referred to as wild horses that were said to be brought in from a trekking station .
The brouhaha could become a PR nightmare for the channel , which in recent years has abandoned contrived unscripted formats in favor of the scientific explorations that first made the Discovery brand famous .
“ Wild ” in particular has emerged as one of its main attractions during the past two seasons .
But the company gave no indication about parting ways with the series , only making certain unspecified alterations .
“ Moving forward , the program will be 100 % transparent and all elements of the filming will be explained upfront to our viewers , ” Discovery said .
“ In addition , shows that are to be repeated will be edited appropriately .
Bear Grylls is a world - class adventurer and a terrific talent . ”
A spokeswoman for Discovery declined to elaborate on what exact measures will be taken to address the concerns raised about “ Wild . ”
Among the likely possibilities : a disclaimer that will precede each episode explaining that some of the events being depicted are dramatized .
On July 13 , Grylls spoke at the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour in Los Angeles about production of the series but gave little hint of any shenanigans behind the scenes .
At one point , he described what it was like to bed down in the wild .
“ Often at nighttime , they will get helicoptered out , and they might have to recharge camera batteries and hand in footage , and then they leave me a little minicamera for the night stuff , and they come and rejoin me in the morning , ” he said .

There are also some similarities to the 2001 recession , which likewise followed a huge speculative boom .
The bursting of the Internet bubble brought a huge decline in corporate investment , and the 2001 recession helped to cleanse investors of their exaggerated hopes for the stock market , particularly for technology and the dot - coms .
A similar cleansing of thinking appears under way regarding the housing market .
But residential investment is not as big a component of gross domestic product as nonresidential investment ; the decline in the housing market has apparently not yet been enough to push us into recession territory .
Consumer confidence indexes have not yet fallen as they did at the onset of the last two recessions .
But confidence is a delicate psychological state , not easily quantified .
It is related to the stories that people are talking about at the moment , narratives that put emotional color into otherwise dry economic statistics .
In August 1990 , for example , a series of events in the Persian Gulf severely damaged business confidence , and that sequence seems to explain the timing of the 1990 recession .
Saddam Hussein started his surprise invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 , 1990 , and the United States began sending jet planes to Saudi Arabia shortly thereafter ; the Gulf War abruptly became a virtual certainty .
Mr. Hussein asked Muslims around the world to join in a jihad against the forces opposing him .
In the United States , people started canceling business trips .
August was also the month when intense public conversation began about the economy ’s weakness .
In a sense , that was when the recession started , not the July date given by the bureau committee .
It is clear that salient , emotion - arousing narratives — those that capture the popular imagination and damage public confidence — are central to the etiology of recessions .
As these stories gain currency , they impel people to curtail their spending , both in business and their personal lives .
IS this happening now ?
A disturbing narrative began to unfold in the last couple of months .
People began talking of failed institutions — of the possibility that savings socked away in a money market account might actually be invested in subprime loans and so be lost .
There has been fear of locked credit markets , of possible bank failures and runs on banks .
Some of these tales have faded — bank runs no longer seem a risk .
But confidence in the economy remains fragile .
More shocks are likely as an era of huge real estate speculation apparently ends , with the possibility of further surges in foreclosures and failures of financial institutions .
The narrative is still unfolding , and the extent of its virulence is not yet known .
Nancy Pelosi went on FOX News Sunday today to talk aboout the SCHIP / Bush veto .
And here 's example # ___ ( fill in the blank ) of the ridiculous questions that come from a FNC host ...
Only on FOX would Chris Wallace actually ask this of a Democratic leader :
Download Download
Wallace :
You said the other day that you pray for President Bush to change his mind about vetoing SCHIP ... Ahhh , do you pray for our soldiers to win in Iraq ?
Pelosi :
Of , course I do .
Wallace :
To win ?
Pelosi : Of , course .
What a question ....
At least she called him out on it .... If I was Pelosi , I would have added , " jackass . "
And you wonder why C&L has had so much success highlighting the biased coverage at FOX .
His second " to win ? " gives it just the added touch of Malkinite that really shows he cares .
" We know you might possibly pray for the troops , Mrs. Satan , but what kinds of prayers are they really ?
Hmmmm ?
The question implies that Nancy and the Democratic party really , really , really hate the troops .
Rove would be pleased .
Wallace was " wanknificent " this morning .
Actually Chris , I 'm praying for a rise in the already horrific PTSD injuries the troops are sustaining for Christmas , so how is your family ?
I know it 's Sunday morning and your coffee is in your hand , but give us a list of questions Chris Wallace would really like to ask ....

Democratic Senator and 2008 presidential hopeful Barack Obama defended his criticisms of conservative Christian leaders in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network reporter David Brody .
" When you have pastors and television pundits who appear to explicitly coordinate with one political party ; when you 're implying that your fellow Americans are traitors , terrorist sympathizers or akin to the devil himself ; then I think you 're attempting to hijack the faith of those who follow you for your own personal or political ends , " the freshman Illinois Senator said at The Brody File .
Brody had asked Obama about his critique of Christian right leaders given in a June 23 address to a convention of the United Church of Christ , the senator 's denomination .
" [ S ] omewhere along the way , faith stopped being used to bring us together ... Faith started being used to drive us apart .
Faith got hijacked , " the New York Times reported .
The Senator also argued to Brody that America is not a ' Christian nation . '
" For my friends on the right , I think it would be helpful to remember the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy but also our religious practice , " Obama wrote to Brody , pointing to early American leaders who fought to include the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights .
He went on , " Whatever we once were , we 're no longer just a Christian nation ; we are also a Jewish nation , a Muslim nation , a Buddhist nation , a Hindu nation , and a nation of non-believers . "
In an analytical follow - up , Brody implied that Obama 's stance could pose political risks .
" So while he tries to make the distinction by pointing out problems with these leaders , in the process , by proxy , millions of Evangelicals may take that criticism personally as well , " he wrote .

About Market Anarchism
Great part of that order which reigns among mankind is not the effect of government .
It has its origin in the principles of society and the natural constitution of man .
It existed prior to government , and would exist if the formality of government was abolished .
The mutual dependence and reciprocal interest which man has upon man , and all the parts of civilised community upon each other , create that great chain of connection which holds it together .
The landholder , the farmer , the manufacturer , the merchant , the tradesman , and every occupation , prospers by the aid which each receives from the other , and from the whole .
Common interest regulates their concerns , and forms their law ; and the laws which common usage ordains , have a greater influence than the laws of government .
In fine , society performs for itself almost everything which is ascribed to government .

Unique technology that uses the enzymes of fireflies to read the genetic code of DNA has been installed at the University of Liverpool .
Liverpool is one of only two universities in the UK with the machine , which can read up to 100 million DNA letters in a few hours compared to technology currently in use that can only process 50,000 .
The machine - called GS - Flex - is unique in that it uses an enzyme found in fireflies as a flash light to help read the DNA strand .
Scientists from all over the UK will be able to use the new technology for a variety of different purposes , from cancer research to veterinary science .
Researchers at Liverpool , for example are looking at DNA sequencing of the malaria parasite .
By studying changes in parasite DNA scientists aim to understand why some species of malaria can infect humans and others can only infect other animals .
Professor Neil Hall , at the University ’s School of Biological Sciences , explains : “ This new machine is invaluable not only for research into diseases such as cancer and malaria , but for our understanding of genetics as a whole .
For example we have scientists looking at the DNA of fish in understanding how genes are activated and we have veterinary scientists looking at how illnesses in domestic pets can be passed to humans .
“ We have a team of experts at the University that are skilled in using this technology and we are therefore in a position to welcome collaboration with other institutions in reaping the benefits of this . ”
Current DNA sequencing has been pioneered by institutes like the Wellcome Trust ’s Sanger Institute .
It was here that scientists decoded a record - breaking two billion letters of DNA in the human genome .
In order to do this , however the technology which was large and complex required hundred of machines housed in specially constructed buildings .
The new state - of - the - art machine is now no bigger than a photocopier and stored in a laboratory at the University ’s School of Biological Sciences .

[ Update 3/14/07 : Distribution of Sunni and Shia in the world .
Larger pic : Wikimedia - Thanks Jonathan Soeder !]
The Dilemma : Despite hearing news about the Middle East every day , you still do n't know Shia from shinola .
People You Can Impress : Iranians , Iraqis , Syrians , Jordanians , and TV talking heads .
The Quick Trick :
The Shia believe that the early succession of power should have gone like the name of a very famous boxer : 1 ) Muhammad , 2 ) Ali .
The Explanation : Like Christianity , Islam is home to a spectrum of sects espousing different beliefs and practices .
And just as Christianity can be divided into two large groups - Catholic and Protestant - from which other subsects have emerged , so too with Islam : Shia and Sunni .
Unlike Christianity , whose major split would n't occur for nearly sixteen centuries , Islam split almost immediately after the death of its founder , the Prophet Muhammad ( circa 570 - 632 CE ) .
The rift stems from a disagreement among Muslims over who was the rightful successor to Muhammad .
After the prophet 's death on June 8 , 632 , a gathering of his followers met at Medina and proclaimed Abu Bakr ( kinsman , companion , and early convert of Muhammad ) caliph , or political leader .
The claim stemmed from his close relationship with Muhammad , and the fact that Muhammad had asked Abu Bakr to lead prayers when too ill to do so himself .
Those who recognize Abu Bakr and his three immediate successors , called the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs , are referred to as Sunni Muslims , and today almost 90 percent of Muslims worldwide fall into this category .
One group of followers , however , refused to accept Abu Bakr .
These Rafidi ( " Refusers " ) supported the claim of Ali ibn Abi Talib , Muhammad 's cousin ( and son - in - law ) .
The claim is based on a sermon the Prophet had given at Ghadir Khum , in which Muhammad referred to Ali as mawla , which some translate as " master . "
Ali 's supporter called themselves Shiat Ali ( the Party of Ali ) , though today they are known as simply Shia .
Ali did eventually ascend as the fourth caliph .
To Sunni , he is the last of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs .
But to Shias , he is the first caliph and , more important , the first Imam - a word Shia Muslims use to refer to the person chosen leader of all the faithful .
While they and the Sunnis both revere the Koran , they accept different hadiths ( oral traditions ) , so their laws are different .
Many Shias , for example , allow temporary marriage .
Shias also recognize esteemed imams as supreme expert on Islamic law , called Ayatollahs or , for the really big guys , Grand Ayatollahs .
As for the locations where Shias have a significant Muslim majority , there are really only two : Iraq and Iran .
Much is made of the differences between Shias and Sunnis , but almost all the violence between them in the past 50 years has been caused , directly or indirectly , by Saddam Hussein - a nominal Sunni who by his own admission was never religious .

A burst of colour from Sunday evening 's display in Edinburgh
The first festival of its kind took place in 1947 and for the past 27 years , a firework display from Edinburgh castle has impressed crowds craning their necks towards the ramparts , which rise from a central promontory of rock .
On Sunday 2 September , 250,000 sets of eyes and ears experienced the combined effect of over 100,000 fireworks and more than 50 musical instruments .
But how was the show choreographed to satisfy both senses ?
" With synchronicity , sympathy and symmetry " , said pyrotechnician Keith Webb , 46 , whose company Pyrovision designed and executed the 35 - minute display .
As pyrotechnical director of the show , his role was to scrutinise his team 's timing and that of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra , and to make any immediate adjustments to ensure the fireworks exploded in time to the music .
THE ANSWER
Codes are called out by a score reader , alerting a ' firer ' to send electronic pulses which ignite the fireworks
Festival ends with a bang
His was one of four essential timekeeping roles : a conductor to lead the orchestra , a score - reader to call out a series of firework codes , a " firer " to ignite the fireworks and a director to compensate for any timing differences .
" The challenge is to call the code fractionally before the cue , to take into consideration the time it takes for my call to register with the person setting off the firework and for him to press the button , " says score - reader Andrew Moore .
He had to call several of the 198 codes , each corresponding to a particular set of fireworks , two or three seconds before the cue , to allow for their " rising time " and " burst delay " .
It 's a job that demands lightning - quick reflexes , says firer Gary Dunn , who compares it to a " sprinter setting off on the gun " .
Mr Webb explains his role thus : " If , for example , the conductor speeds up , I might overrule the score - reader 's call , telling the firer to kill a set of shells ; otherwise you could end up with loud banging in a quiet section of the music . "
Silver waterfall
Several tricks of the trade enable him to deal with such situations : lighting a firework at both ends will decrease its duration , as will igniting a second firework before the first has finished , creating a layering effect .
The display was ' scripted ' over 24 pages
" We used Roman candles to mimic the military beats of the snare drum in Gershwin 's Strike up the Band , " says Mr Webb .
Fireworks were also used to enhance the tone of a piece .
During Barber 's Adagio for Strings , which was poignantly used in the film Platoon , silent flashes of colour flared from the castle battlements , echoing " the emotional pull " of the piece .
A silver waterfall , which has become the centrepiece of the annual show , was also supposed to cascade down the north face of the castle during this piece .
However , a technical fault meant that the 1,250 volt charge failed to ignite the length of 70 upside - down fountains .
In order to cover the visual gap which would have been left , Mr Webb overruled the score - reader 's call , setting off the next set of fireworks early .
The fault was repaired and the waterfall was ignited during the last minute of the finale .
" Each year , I hear people saying the waterfall was their favourite , and it gives me a secret buzz , " says Warren Griffiths , who erected the specially - designed effect .
Funny fireworks
And there 's even scope for humour .
A series of hummer mines , which make a " sliding " sound were used to tell the story of a cowgirl slipping from her horse in Copeland 's Buckaroo Holiday .
A firework , which exploded into the shape of a horse 's tail , was also used for a " literal visual image " .
THE SHOW IN NUMBERS
More than 100,000 fireworks , equalling four tonnes 35 minutes of music 250,000 spectators 56 musicians 24 - page firework script 198 ignitions Finale : 133 fireworks in 3 secs
The pyrotechnical interpretation of Ives ' Three Places in New England however was punctuated by a series of seemingly random flares erupting from the battlements to mimic the " disjointed " nature of the music .
" It 's often difficult pieces of music like this which are our most successful .
A fresh challenge pushes you to come up with the best ideas , " says Wilf Scott , of Pyrovision .
A choreographed firework display takes several months ' planning .
Having laboured for four weeks preparing the material , a team of 14 spent seven days installing the fireworks at the castle .
After listening to the music " about 100 times " and sourcing specific firework effects over a period of months , it took a fortnight to design the show .
While pyrotechnicians can prepare for many eventualities , they cannot predict the weather .
Conditions are monitored every hour during the week before an event and on the day of the show , test shells are exploded and the debris monitored to determine the wind strength and direction .
These findings are passed to the police , ambulance service , and council health and safety officials , who may decide to cancel the display , relocate spectators or remove some of the larger fireworks .
Fortunately this year 's choreographed display was not hampered by the weather and the famous waterfall , though somewhat delayed , was yet again on everyone 's lips .
The use of Wikipedia as a source of information for classwork has been widely reported on and has even happened in classes taught by our own Ken Fisher .
But this may not mean that Wikipedia has no place in the classroom , if Martha Groom at the University of Washington - Bothell has her way .
Instead of letting her students rely on Wikipedia as a source , however , Groom has turned it into a destination for their classwork : in place of a term paper , her students were required to create Wikipedia entries .
Groom , who teaches environment and ecology classes , presented her experience at the 2007 EDUCAUSE conference , which focuses on IT in the education environment .
Her initial goal was simply to provide some meaning to the college - level term paper , which typically has an audience of one ( the professor ) before ending its career in a recycling bin .
Groom hoped that assigning students the task of creating a Wikipedia entry would make the effort more meaningful , since students were writing for what might be a wider audience and with the intention of providing a general public benefit .
She also suggested that the project would be a good introduction to the academic world , which focuses on the production and dissemination of knowledge .
To that end , she assigned two of her classes the task of generating Wikipedia entries focused on globalization and sustainable development .
34 students in one class and 14 student groups in a second participated ; all but one student found it a valuable experience , and many reported that they felt more personally invested in the work .
For her part , Groom felt that the quality of the work was superior to the typical in - class assignment .
The Wikipedia community , however , was not as impressed .
One article did n't survive for 24 hours following its introduction , and four additional ones were ultimately deleted following extensive discussion , their contents merged into existing entries .
Groom also noted that some of the comments in the ensuing discussions " were delivered rudely . "
There were also some practical issues regarding the use of Wikipedia , primarily related to the process of posting in the appropriate markup format .
The students also needed some help learning the language and style appropriate for an encyclopedia - type work .
Some of the other issues actually contributed to the pedagogical experience , such as learning to identify credible material , appropriately using copyrighted items , providing appropriate references , and identifying research topics by noting gaps in the existing Wikipedia material .
The combination of these issues required significantly more hands - on time by Groom than a typical term paper would .
I 'm not sure if this is a general or long - term solution to the fact that producing term papers has become a bit of a numbing ritual for students .
Wikipedia is selective about the significance of the material it incorporates , and many areas of study already have detailed material in place , so there 's going to be finite room for contributions .
But the fact that Groom has identified features that get students more involved — a broad audience and sense of ownership of their work — might help other professors find ways of getting their own students more motivated .
6 months ago I was excited to get moderate pay in a painful contract job .
Now I 'm the co-founder of a company funded by YCombinator .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The iPhone and Apple Inc.'s AAPL.
O desktop computers may be vulnerable to hackers due to a flaw in their Web browser , according to a security firm , which said it found a way to hack into the iPhone .
The iPhone is seen inside the Apple Store in New York , June 29 , 2007 .
The iPhone may be vulnerable to hackers due to a flaw that allows them to take control of the device , according a report in the New York Times on Monday .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
Baltimore - based Independent Security Evaluators , which tests its clients ’ computer security by hacking it , said on Monday that three employees found a way to take control of iPhones through a Wi -Fi link or by tricking users into going to a Web site .
Charles Miller , principal security analyst at the firm , said a security weakness allows someone to take control of Apple ’s Safari Web browser and see other applications on the device at the same time , which could potentially make users of Macintosh desktop computers vulnerable to attacks .
“ The same problem actually exists on Apple ’s desktops , ” said Miller .
But he added that while his firm had identified the risk for both desktops and phones , it had written only the code necessary to hack into the iPhone .
The security consultants , who took about a week and a half to work out the move , said they were able to take control of an iPhone and make calls or send text messages , as well as access e-mails , voice - mail , address books and call and Web browsing history .
Miller said his company gave details about the hack and a potential security patch to Apple , but did not publicly release the details .
“ We ’re looking into the report submitted by ( Integrated Security Evaluators ) and we always welcome feedback on how to improve our security , ” Apple spokeswoman Lynn Fox said .
Miller said Apple could have avoided the risk by eliminating links between the browser and other applications .
“ It turns out that on the iPhone there are probably some basic things they could have done that would have made it better , ” said Miller .
The claim comes almost two months after Apple and AT&T Inc T.N started selling Apple 's first cell phone , which includes a music and video player as well as a Web browser .
As many as 700,000 iPhones were sold on the first weekend after the June 29 launch , according to analyst estimates .
Days after launch , a well - known hacker Jon Johansen , claimed to have overcome restrictions on the iPhone , allowing highly technical users to bypass AT&T ’s network to use the phone ’s Internet and music features .
While cell phones have not historically been as vulnerable to attack as desktop computers , some experts worry that phones take on greater risks as they add more computer - like features .
Miller said he had not looked into security on other mobile phones to see how they compare to the iPhone , but said the more complex a system is , the greater the likelihood is that it will have problems .
If you live in China , do n't even think of using the Internet to read up on Tiananmen Square or surf for porn .
But if you want to take a shot at hacking into American military computer systems , there may be a place for you in the Chinese military .
Reports are spreading that US government sources are confirming their beliefs that the Chinese military has " hacked " into Pentagon computer systems , including one that serves the office of Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
The story first appeared at the Financial Times , where an unidentified source is quoted as saying that there was a " very high level of confidence ... trending towards total certainty " that the attacks were the responsibility of the People 's Liberation Army .
Although it does n't appear that sensitive data was compromised , the report is troubling because it shows China can strike at even high - level military systems and even knock some offline ( some Pentagon computers were off - network for a week after the attack ) .
Of course , the article rightly notes that the US itself is engaged in an international game of probing military networks around the globe , so this could be a tit - for - tat attempt at hacking .
With secure networks now providing battlefield intelligence , live feeds from drone aircraft , and communications channels for much of the military , network warfare and defense are becoming increasingly crucial .
The threats do n't always come from governments , either .
Entire nations can have web services disrupted by criminals utilizing vast botnets to choke off access to government agencies or web sites .
In fact , this appears to have happened to Estonia earlier this year when a massive DDoS attack kept several state sites down for multiple days .
Suspicion in the Estonia attack focused quickly on Russia , with some NATO officials worried enough about the situation to journey to Estonia in order to " observe " the attack firsthand .
But botnet attacks , by their very nature , can be almost impossible to trace back to the controller .
In the case of Estonia , the country 's prime minister eventually blamed the matter on " criminal activity " rather than official Russian government involvement .
Could the Chinese attack turn out to have a similar origin ?
To be sure , just because you can trace something to China does n't mean that the Chinese government or military is involved .
In fact , a new report from Sophos released today says that 49 percent of malware sites in August of this year were hosted somewhere in China .
Whatever the cause , such events do encourage organizations to take much closer looks at their computer and network security practices .
The Pentagon has already announced that it will conduct a comprehensive audit of its systems in order to tighten them up further .
We have contacted the Defense Department 's media office for further comment .
Update :
China denies the report that it was involved in the hacking .
A foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC that " some people are making wild accusations against China ...
These are totally groundless and also reflect a Cold War mentality . "
Layton Ehmke ,
Homer Tribune — Conspicuous signs reflected the frustrations of the dozen - or - so activists lining WKFL Park on Pioneer Avenue Saturday .
Those driving by showed their support for voicing those concerns with the presidency by honking and waving in return .
Amy Bollenbach , chair of the Homer Citizens for Impeachment group that has grown to 30 members since its inception four weeks ago , said the movement is partly fueled by the shame she carries about the state of the country — that , and the accusations about botched CIA reports , an empty connection between Iraq and Sept. 11 , spying and tapping citizens ’ phones and the lack of cooperation on congressional inquiries .
“ I guess the motivation is that I ’m very worried about our country and our reputation throughout the world , ” Bollenbach said .
“ This administration has done some things that are very bad and have harmed the rest of the U.S.
It ’s sad our reputation is as bad as it is .
Bollenbach said she feels that , as a country , we ’re losing the good name we ’ve had since after World War II .
“ Not only are we losing that reputation , but the democracy that includes rights for everyone , ” she said .
“ Lots of people were honking , but there were a few unpleasant hand signals that used the middle finger — but it was n’t bad . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
With tensions rising between the United States and Turkey over a resolution that labels the World War I -era massacre of Armenians by Turkish forces " genocide , " many are asking why the House is debating the resolution now .
Rep .
Tom Lantos says passage of the genocide resolution would help restore America 's moral authority .
The House Foreign Affairs committee voted 27 - 21 Wednesday to approve the nonbinding resolution , which declares that the deportation of nearly 2 million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923 -- resulting in the deaths of 1.5 million -- was " systematic " and " deliberate , " amounting to " genocide . "
The Democratic leadership has not scheduled a final vote .
Administration officials have lobbied against the resolution , saying good U.S - Turkish relations are vital to U.S. forces in Iraq .
The Pentagon says 70 percent of the military 's cargo heading into Iraq either flies into or over Turkey .
But House Democrats view the resolution as part of their mandate to restore America 's moral authority around the world .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Thursday said arguments that Turkey is too vital an ally to alienate has delayed the resolution for too long .
Watch Speaker Pelosi defend the timing of the debate »
" I 've been in Congress for 20 years .
And for 20 years , people have been saying the same thing . "
Pelosi said Thursday .
" There 's never a good time .
And all of us in the Democratic leadership have supported ... reiterating the Americans ' acknowledgement of a genocide . "
" As long as there is genocide , there is need to speak out against it , " she added .
And one of the chief supporters of the resolution , House Foreign Affairs Chairman Tom Lantos , D - California , was unmoved by the administration 's arguments that Turkey would block the use of U.S. airbases on Turkish soil .
" The Turkish government will not act against the United States because that would be against their own interests , " he told CNN .
" I 'm convinced of this . "
Lantos , the only member of the House who is a Holocaust survivor , says passage of the resolution would also help to bring a moral dimension back to U.S. foreign policy .
" One of the problems we have diplomatically globally is that we have lost our moral authority which we used to have in great abundance , " Lantos said .
" People around the globe who are familiar with these events will appreciate the fact that the United States is speaking out against a historic injustice .
This would be like sweeping slavery under the rug and saying slavery never occurred . "
But Democrats are not united behind the measure , Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton , D - Missouri , has sent a letter to Pelosi on Thursday opposing the resolution , saying the resulting backlash threatened by Turkey could disrupt " America 's ability to redeploy U.S. military forces from Iraq , " a top Democratic priority .
And the top Republican in the House , Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said Thursday that bringing the resolution up for a final vote would be " totally irresponsible . "
" The fact is that Turkey is a very good ally of the United States .
They are critical to our security , not only her to but our troops oversees , " Boehner said .
" Let the historians decide what happened 90 years ago . "

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Willie " Pete " Williams had no idea when he was pulled over by police that the criminal justice system was about to steal away half his life .
Willie " Pete " Williams , 45 , spent half of his life behind bars for a 1985 rape he did not commit .
Sitting in the flashing glow of Atlanta squad car lights along Georgia State Road 400 , the 23 - year - old part - time house painter did n't know police were looking for a rapist who had struck nearby three weeks earlier .
Police questioned -- and then arrested Williams , triggering a series of mistaken witness identifications that led to his unjust conviction for rape , kidnapping and aggravated sodomy .
It was 1985 and Williams was sentenced to serve 45 years in prison for a crime he did n't commit .
" I felt betrayed .
... I felt like these people had taken my life for something I did n't do .
I felt like I was being treated unfairly .
... I felt very , very angry towards everybody , " said Williams last week , a free man after nearly 22 years behind bars .
He said he spent many of those years stoking that anger by fighting guards and inmates , while his childhood friends were developing careers and raising families .
Watch Williams offer more details about his prison nightmare »
Earlier this year , after DNA science proved his innocence , the 45 - year - old with a graying mustache stood again before a judge -- who this time exonerated Williams .
Watch Williams celebrate after a judge freed him »
Williams ' troubling story provokes discomfort in a nation that prides itself on a justice system where the accused are innocent until proven guilty .
So far , DNA evidence has directly exonerated 208 wrongly convicted people in the United States , according to the Innocence Project .
It 's unknown how many prisoners now locked up in American jails could be freed by new testing of DNA evidence .
A jury of Williams ' peers convicted him in the April 5 , 1985 , rape , kidnapping and aggravated sodomy of a woman in Atlanta 's Sandy Springs neighborhood .
The victim told police her attacker first approached her to ask if she could help him find someone named Paul .
Then he produced a gun and forced her into her car , according to police .
They then drove to a dead - end street where the assault occurred .
Because the science behind each person 's unique DNA signature was new to police in 1985 , the key evidence that sealed Williams ' fate was the testimony of three eyewitnesses who mistakenly said they recognized him .
" Mistaken eyewitness identification has long been the single biggest factor in the conviction of innocents , " said Barry Scheck , co-founder of the Innocence Project .
" That has got to be important to everybody , because if we can reform identification procedures , it will keep more innocent people out of jail and convict criminals who really commit the crimes . "
A national nonprofit group , the Innocence Project has inspired creation of state and regional organizations including the Georgia Innocence Project , which exonerated Williams .
As a new prisoner Williams said he fought a painful struggle against the raw deal the world had dealt him .
When board members denied him parole the first of three times Williams said , " they had to escort me to ' the hole ' [ solitary confinement ] . "
" I could n't function out there around the other inmates , " Williams said .
" I was mad , I was bitter .
I felt the whole world just gave me up . "
It was n't until 1997 -- more than a decade after he was locked away -- that Williams ' own voice freed him from the grip of his anger .
At Valdosta State Prison , a close friend named Charlie Brown helped him join a Christian choir -- leading him to accept Jesus .
" Singing was like being out here , in a sense .
It freed me from all the things , from all the fights , from the officers who were cruel , prison , stabbings , " said Williams , who especially embraced the hymn " Amazing Grace . "
After singing got a hold of Williams , he said the hardest part of his heart started to dissolve .
" I did n't feel angry anymore -- or any hate . "
Witness ID Sequential double - blind lineups are standard in : New Jersey Suffolk County , Massachusetts Northhampton , Massachusetts Madison , Wisconsin Hennepin County , Minnesota Ramsey County , Minnesota Winston - Salem , North Carolina Santa Clara County , California Virginia Beach , Virginia Source : Innocence Project
To prevent more tragedies like Williams ' , innocence projects in many states , including Georgia , have begun pressing lawmakers to adopt special witness ID procedures called sequential double - blind lineups .
Such lineups are administrated by officials who do n't know who the suspect is and present each member of a lineup one - by - one instead of simultaneously .
Witnesses who see several potential suspects simultaneously are more likely to choose a person who looks most like the perpetrator -- but who may not actually be the perpetrator , according to the Innocence Project .
The group also cites research that says misidentification is reduced if the person overseeing the lineup is " blind " to which person in the lineup is the suspect .
Georgia 's Legislature held hearings Monday in Atlanta to study the research and the proposed standards , which have been adopted by New Jersey and jurisdictions in Minnesota , California and elsewhere .
Louis M. Dekmar , vice chair of the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies is skeptical of the research , but said the issue deserves further study .
" I do n't believe the research is so compelling that we need to make swings and changes that do n't bode well for criminal investigations and the criminal justice process , " said Dekmar , a 30 - year law enforcement veteran and chief of police for LaGrange , Georgia .
Dekmar argues investigators should be allowed to administer lineups to gauge reaction while they look at witness faces , to see if a witness is " stressed , weeping , nervous -- all those reactions that help detectives formulate whether this is a strong identification or a weak identification . "
Williams ' Case April 5 , 1985 : Woman raped , kidnapped in Atlanta , Georgia
Williams arrested : April 28 , 1985
Sentence : 45 years in prison Freed : January 23 , 2007 Exonerated by DNA evidence : February 13 , 2007
February 10 , 2007 : DNA tests result in arrest and eventual conviction of Kenneth G. Wicker for the 1985 rape
Sources : Innocence Project , Atlanta Journal - Constitution
Williams was convicted on the identification of three witnesses who first singled him out from a photo lineup , according to the Georgia Innocence Project .
More than 20 years later , Georgia Innocence Project attorneys arranged to compare Williams ' DNA with DNA evidence collected from the 1985 rape .
It was not a match , proving that Williams was not the attacker and opening the door to his release .
Shortly after Williams ' exoneration , DNA science again played a role in the case when a genetic match resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of Kenneth G. Wicker for the crime that Williams had been wrongly convicted of .
Years earlier Wicker had served four years in prison for another rape and two attempted sexual assaults , according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution .
As Scheck 's Innocence Project marks its 15th year , the 1995 O.J. Simpson defense attorney describes it as a movement for criminal justice as well as human rights .
" I think that it 's going to be remembered for getting innocents out of jail , but also for changing the paradigm in the criminal justice system , " said Scheck .
" There is a greater understanding now that sound scientific and critical research can go a long way toward proving injustice and prosecuting the guilty . "
Sometimes an Innocence Project client is confirmed to be guilty by DNA evidence , but the group does n't make the number of those cases available .
Theoretically ,
If key DNA material in a case is properly preserved , there 's no time limit on revisiting old cases , according to the Innocence Project .
Critics accuse the group of denying closure to communities and victims ' families by giving new life to old cases .
To that , project spokesman Eric Ferrero said , " Victims are not served by the wrong people being convicted . "
Perhaps the most important victory for the project has been its role in sparing the lives of 15 people condemned to death .
In 2000 , 13 condemned prisoners were exonerated by a group of Northwestern University students affiliated with the Innocence Project .
Some of the innocent prisoners were freed through DNA testing , others were exonerated after new trials were ordered by appellate courts .
Those spared lives prompted then - Illinois Gov. George Ryan to declare a state moratorium on all executions and later , a blanket clemency of all 167 death row prisoners .
The moratorium remains in effect while Illinois authorities consider proposed reforms to the system .
Back in Georgia , during the ten months since Williams ' friends and family welcomed him home with hugs and kisses , he 's been taking his time rejoining society , attending electronics classes and dealing with his top complaint : 21st century traffic .
Williams has found a home in a church congregation and plans to join its choir , holding on to the spiritual anchor he formed in prison .
Money is tight for Williams , and , according to the Innocence Project , only 45 percent of those exonerated by DNA evidence have been financially compensated .
He expects some compensation from Georgia , although the state has no law guiding such cases .
Regaining his freedom has renewed Williams ' belief in the power of prayer , but he said it has done little to repair his faith in the nation 's justice system .
He wonders how many other Americans are still suffering injustices like his own .
" When I see someone on television when they say , ' this is a suspect , ' I have a difficult time believing that that actually is a suspect , " Williams said .
" That 's how I 'm affected now . "

Former Senator Fred D. Thompson has yet to make a formal declaration that he is running for president , but already his noncampaign campaign has gone through its first shake - up .
A week of personnel turnover that extended from his campaign - manager - in - waiting down to volunteers raised questions about whether the Thompson camp is prepared to jump fully into the race for the Republican presidential nomination , a race in which his rivals have had months to establish their campaign organizations , raise money and hone strategy .
It also ignited speculation in Republican circles about who is really in charge , and in particular about the extent of the role being played by Mr. Thompson ’s wife , Jeri Kehn Thompson , a former political operative .
On Tuesday , Tom Collamore , a top adviser to Mr. Thompson , stepped aside .
At the same time , Mr. Thompson ’s political operation announced that it was bringing in Randy Enwright , a veteran Republican strategist with ties to the Bush family , and former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham , to take over the prospective campaign .
The next day , the organization ’s research director quit , and other staff members walked out .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday approved an $ 850 billion increase in U.S. borrowing authority to $ 9.815 trillion in order to avoid a default as the government nears its credit limit of $ 8.965 trillion .
The committee approved the bill on a voice vote and it clears the way for the full Senate to take action most likely by early October .
As of last Friday , the federal debt stood at $ 8.923 trillion and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has been urging Congress to act quickly to avoid unnerving financial markets that are already jittery over rising mortgage foreclosures .
The amount approved by the finance panel would allow the government to continue borrowing into 2009 , well after next year ’s presidential and congressional elections .
Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat expressed concern that the debt issue could “ become a political football ” during next year ’s campaigns .
“ The increase of $ 850 billion would be the third largest debt limit increase in U.S. history , ” Baucus said .
The U.S. House of Representatives already approved the credit increase when it passed the 2008 budget blueprint earlier this year .
It will be the fifth increase in the U.S. credit limit since President George W. Bush took office in 2001 when the U.S. debt stood at $ 5.6 trillion .
YouPorn is the highest trafficked adult website in the world and boasts a higher Alexa rating than both CNN and Weather.com , reports Portfolio .
Saw that one coming , did n't we ?
But YouPorn and other blue Web 2.0 startups could be out of business in the near future if proposed changes to 18 U.S.C. 2257 are accepted into law .
Known in the industry as " 2257 , " 18 U.S.C. 2257 defines requirements porn producers must follow to verify the age of every performer , keep records about the performers ' identities and make those records available to the government .
The proposed changes would extend the statute 's reach beyond adult - content producers to include social networking websites .
That could mean every adult who wants to upload a naughty picture to a social network would have to submit a photo ID and state their full name , date of birth and other personal information .
The network would have to maintain that record for as long as the picture exists – likely in perpetuity throughout the universe – and ensure the record is available without question to The Authorities for 20 hours a week , between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday .
Porn studios already have a hard time complying with all the ins and outs of recordkeeping laws .
And while adult social networking sites do seem to try to keep illegal material off their servers , I think it would be impossible for a social networking site to comply with the proposed changes .
What if users submit false information – who gets punished ?
Who verifies IDs ?
A studio production assistant can check performer IDs in person ; would social networks have to open offices all over the country to verify prospective members in person ?
Good luck with that one .
Few people know much about the recordkeeping requirements .
It 's like the FBI warning you can't fast - forward on a DVD – it 's included on every porn website and adult video , but does n't stand out to viewers any more than gang graffiti on delivery trucks in my east Los Angeles neighborhood .
But if the proposed changes come to pass , I hope we 'll see a much overdue surge of patriotism and protest .
After all , this is n't the administration blatantly tucking the Bill of Rights into the back of a storage closet – our personal sex lives are at stake !
The ostensible purpose of the law is to curtail child pornography , and no legitimate porn producer argues with that .
In fact , many have become rather paranoid about not letting underage individuals slip through the screening process .
Yet porn and adult social networking are entirely different things .
The former is entertainment ; the latter is sex .
An adult social networking site is not about producers publishing static content in hopes of making a profit .
It 's about people coming together and sharing sexual experiences .
They might plan to hook up in person or keep the sex online ; they might simply participate in exhibitionism or voyeurism ; it can be entirely fantasy or a platform for ongoing relationships .
Sometimes it's as simple as uploading a favorite clip from a porn DVD .
But the foundation of social networking , or user - generated content , or Web 2.0 , or whatever you want to call it , is community .
Users do n't passively look at content someone else chose to shove at them .
They share , rate , create , organize , recommend , criticize .
No member stands alone .
A porn delivery site is a one - on - one transaction ; a social network is a many - to - many bazaar that exists because its members communicate .
Minors on the site would not go unnoticed .
And adults who frequent adults - only communities do so because those places are adults - only , not because they want to hang out with minors .
It 's not just the technology that would make it impossible to enforce the new regulations on community sites .
It 's the attitude .
Internet community is traditionally against anything smacking of outside control or authority , and the human need to expose ourselves in sexual ways online simply cannot be stopped .
You can put pressure on a business to comply with ridiculous legal requirements , but try leaning on millions of individuals engaging in private , personal behavior in their own bedrooms .
Even Alabama focused its sex - toy ban on the stores , not on the use or possession by individuals .
User - generated content may not be as slick as studio porn , but that 's okay when the content is real – when it 's no longer porn , but sex .
It 's the difference between form and substance , or between art and life .
We have become complacent in recent years about the government 's ability to control the form and art of things .
But the substance – the life – the sex ?
Not when the venue is this private ( your own home ) and does n't involve controversial , far - reaching public decisions that involve minors , like sex education versus abstinence curriculum .
And not when the regulations no longer apply to some amorphous other ( the " adult industry " ) but to regular people doing something perfectly innocent , like posting a fully nude self - portrait on an adults - only network .
Porn is always going to be political – but sex should n't be .
See you in a fortnight ,

NASA ’s Mars Odyssey spacecraft has turned up what look like the entrances to caves along the slope of a Martian volcano .
If these turn out to be actual tunnels or caves , they could be a scientific goldmine , offering future explorers protection and a unique region to study – perhaps even life could be hiding away from hostile Martian surface environment .
The seven possible cave entrances are dark , and nearly circular , ranging in size from 100 to 250 metres ( 328 to 820 feet ) across .
They were discovered by NASA ’s Mars Odyssey and Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft .
Follow up observations with Odyssey ’s infrared cameras confirmed that they could very well be cavernous entrances into underground regions on Mars .
The infrared evidence showed that the temperatures inside the holes changed less than the surrounding regions .
“ They are cooler than the surrounding surface in the day and warmer at night , ” said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey ’s Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University , Flagstaff , Ariz .
“ Their thermal behavior is not as steady as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature , but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground . ”
One of the downsides of these caves is their altitude .
They ’re located near the top of a massive Martian volcano called Arsia Mons .
At this high altitude , life would have a difficult time coping with the extreme cold and lower air pressure .
Planetary geologists think the caves might have been formed by underground stresses around the volcano .
The caves are inline with with other bowl - shaped pits that appear to have been formed when material collapsed .
There could be long networks of tunnels and stress fractures .
In some cases , the roof just collapsed in completely , and in other places , you might get a cave entrance instead .
The next step is to bring the much more powerful Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ’s camera in to image the regions better .
It might be able to shed some light on the mystery .

Uh , ok . "
Tech Crunch 's Michael Arrington " Google and other Office competitors will be breathing a sigh of relief this morning - this is not a decisive move by Microsoft to crush the competition as they did with Netscape more than a decade ago .
Microsoft has failed to understand the real power of Google Docs - easy , no hassle document creation , collaboration and access from the browser .
And it will take them another two years of fidgeting before they really get scared and react properly .
Microsoft is falling into the classic trap of failing to realize the disruptive nature of a new competitive technology , instead focusing on the massive revenues it generates from their aging Office suite .
Google Docs is tearing the Office wall down , and Microsoft has failed to respond . "
It 's getting sort of crowded out there .

There is always something more to learn .
That was the lesson for me last week when I learned something new about the Java programming language , despite having used professionally it for almost 10 years .
I was upgrading a Java web application to WebSphere server version 6.1 and as the first step I switched the development environment to Rational Application Developer version 7 .
With the new IDE came an improved compiler that reported additional warnings , so it did n't surprise me to see hundreds of new warnings .
It is a standard practice of mine to eliminate warnings , even harmless ones , since a significant warning can easily be missed if harmless warnings are allowed to remain .
As I worked my way through the warnings , I came across a new one I did not recognize : " Finally block does not complete normally " .
A simplified version of the code producing this warning is shown below :
boolean performBusinessOperation ( ) { boolean operationResult = false ; try { // Perform some business logic ... operationResult = true ; } catch ( IllegalStateException e ) { //
Handle this exception ..
operationResult = false ; } catch ( IllegalArgumentException e ) { //
Handle this exception ... operationResult = false ; } finally { // Common cleanup ... //
Following line produces warning // " Finally block does not complete normally " return operationResult ; } }
This was not code I had written , so I spent some time trying to figure out the reason for the warning .
In Java , the finally block is guaranteed to be executed after the contained try block finishes execution , even if an exception is thrown within the try block .
If an exception is thrown and not caught within a function , the exception is propagated up the call stack until it encounters an appropriate catch block .
But in this particular case within the performBusinessOperation method , if an uncaught exception is thrown , the finally block will run and perform the return statement .
So which will win - the exception or the return ?
I was not sure , which in my mind explained the warning - it is bad practice to write code with unclear behavior .
So I fixed the code by moving the return statement outside the finally block and moved on to the next warning .
Once I was finished eliminating warnings , I ran the entire suite of automated unit tests .
To my surprise , I had a few failures .
When I tracked down the offending code , I was surprised to see that it was my fix for the " Finally block does not complete normally " warning that broke the tests .
How could that be ?
After further tracing and debugging , I finally found the reason : the unit test incorrectly invoked the method in question , causing it to throw a NullPointerException from within the try block .
Having the return statement within the finally block apparently was causing the exception to be silently discarded .
I found this shocking .
This is dangerous behavior for a language , and I had problems believing that was actually the case .
So I wrote a quick unit test for verification , shown below .
public class ReturnInFinallyBlockExample extends junit.framework.TestCase { @ SuppressWarnings ( " finally " ) private boolean isReturnWithinFinally ( ) { try { if ( true ) throw new RuntimeException ( ) ; } finally { return true ; //
This hides the exception } } private boolean isReturnOutsideFinally ( ) { try { if ( true ) throw new RuntimeException ( ) ; } finally { //
Return outside finally block .
} return true ; } public void testReturnFromFinallyBlockWithUnhandledException ( ) { assertTrue( isReturnWithinFinally ( ) ) ; try { isReturnOutsideFinally ( ) ; fail ( " Expect exception " ) ; } catch ( RuntimeException e ) { //
Expected case .
} } }
This test case passes , demonstrating that the uncaught exception within the try block is silently discarded if the return statement is within the finally block .
Note my use of the Java 5 annotation @ SuppressWarnings ( " finally " ) in order to stop the compiler from reporting the " Finally block does not complete normally " warning for this example .
Perhaps I should have been less surprised by this behavior in Java given that I was already aware of another suboptimal situation regarding Java exception handling in finally blocks : if an uncaught exception is thrown in a try block and then another exception is thrown in the finally block , it will be the second exception that is propagated out of the method .
The first exception will be silently lost .
The following test case demonstrates this behavior :
public class ExceptionInFinallyBlockExample extends junit.framework.TestCase { private void haveExceptionInFinally Block ( ) { try { if ( true ) throw new IllegalArgumentException ( ) ; } finally { if ( true ) throw new NullPointerException ( ) ; } } public void testHaveExceptionInFinallyBlock ( ) { try { have ExceptionInFinally Block ( ) ; fail ( " Expect exception " ) ; } catch ( NullPointerException e ) { //
Expected case .
} } }
Ignoring errors is dangerous , as I have discussed in my article on Error Handling and Reliability .
So I strongly feel that the Java language should have prohibited return statements in finally blocks .
Fortunately , modern Java IDEs like Eclipse can make up for this shortcoming by allowing you to flag this code construct as an error rather than a warning .

BBC News reports the impending use of carbon nanotubes to create ultra-strong body armor .
Far stronger than any known filament , carbon nanotubes are manufactured by scientists who roll a single - atom - thick stretch of carbon , in the form of graphite , into tiny tubes .
According to the report , carbon nanotubes are ideal for body armor because material made up of them would be good at absorbing energy from fragments striking them at high speed — fragments , perhaps , in the form of bullets and shrapnel .
The report also states that material made from carbon nanotubes “ could also find applications in the area of hi-tech ‘ smart ’ clothing , bomb - proof refuse bins , flexible solar panels , and , eventually , as a replacement for copper wire in transmitting electrical power and signals . ”

Wait Guys !
There 's Something Wrong With The Banner ........ Oh No ...... [ Awful Announcing ]
Stage One : Infatuation
I just got e-mail !
I ca n’t believe it !
It ’s so great !
Here ’s my handle .
Write me !
Who said letter writing was dead ?
Were they ever wrong !
I ’m writing letters like crazy for the first time in years .
I come home and ignore all my loved ones and go straight to the computer to make contact with total strangers .
And how great is AOL ?
It ’s so easy .
It ’s so friendly .
It ’s a community .
Wheeeee !
I ’ve got mail !
Stage Two : Clarification
O.K. , I ’m starting to understand — e-mail is n’t letter - writing at all , it ’s something else entirely .
It was just invented , it was just born and overnight it turns out to have a form and a set of rules and a language all its own .
Not since the printing press .
Not since television .
It ’s revolutionary .
It ’s life - altering .
It ’s shorthand .
Cut to the chase .
Get to the point .
And it saves so much time .
It takes five seconds to accomplish in an e-mail message something that takes five minutes on the telephone .
The phone requires you to converse , to say things like hello and goodbye , to pretend to some semblance of interest in the person on the other end of the line .
Worst of all , the phone occasionally forces you to make actual plans with the people you talk to — to suggest lunch or dinner — even if you have no desire whatsoever to see them .
No danger of that with e-mail .
E-mail is a whole new way of being friends with people : intimate but not , chatty but not , communicative but not ; in short , friends but not .
What a breakthrough .
How did we ever live without it ?
I have more to say on this subject , but I have to answer an Instant Message from someone I almost know .
Ed Balls says " faith schools are popular with many parents "
Schools Secretary Ed Balls and faith group leaders have formed a partnership - endorsing faith schools as a force to improve social cohesion in England .
Mr Balls says faith groups could raise standards in poorer areas , which may be through multi- faith academies .
But a teachers ' union warns that faith schools can separate communities .
At a conference in London , Mr Balls presented a joint policy statement with Church of England , Roman Catholic , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu , Greek Orthodox and Sikh representatives .
Show of unity
Mr Balls committed the government to opening more faith schools where there was parental demand and the faith groups pledged their support for social cohesion and the principle of fair admissions .
FAITH SCHOOLS 6,850 out of a total of 21,000 schools , large majority either Church of England or Roman Catholic 37 Jewish , 7 Muslim , 2 Sikh , 1 Greek Orthodox , 1 Seventh Day Adventist 1.7 million pupils 21 % of faith school secondary pupils from ethnic minorities - 17 % in non faith schools
The schools secretary rejected claims that this show of unity was an attempt to repair the damage from a short - lived attempt by the government to require faith schools to admit a quota of pupils from outside this faith group .
Instead he said it was a reflection of the importance of working in partnership with such a large , successful part of the school system .
" I fully recognise that faith schools are popular with many parents , " he said .
" One thing we 've learnt as a government is that having a distinct ethos , strong leadership , a commitment to promoting opportunity for all , those are the kind of schools where parents want to send their children .
" And there are many faith schools which pass that test with flying colours , " said Mr Balls .
He told the conference that faith schools were a longstanding partner in the drive to raise standards , particularly in more deprived areas .
" Faith schools take very seriously their historic mission to reach out to support children from lower income or disadvantaged backgrounds , " said Mr Balls .
As an example , he said that in Oldham there were plans for a joint Church of England and Muslim academy .
There could be new faith academies - in addition to those replacing existing schools - in which half of the places would be for children from faith groups and the remainder from the wider community .
Backdoor selection
Mr Balls also stressed that faith schools must not use any form of covert selection - such as expensive uniforms , complicated admissions forms or expensive school trips .
HAVE YOUR SAY
All schools should be based on the model of a faith school !
Gavin T , Edinburgh
Send us your comments
In support of the Faith in the System joint statement , the Archbishop of Birmingham , Vincent Nichols , said it was a myth that faith schools had fewer children from ethnic minorities or from less well off backgrounds .
The schools secretary said any expansion in the faith school sector would depend on demand from the local community - but that the school building programme could help to meet the demand for more Muslim schools .
While there were 376,000 Muslim children aged between five and 15 at the last census , there are only 1,770 pupils in the seven state - funded Muslim schools in England .
However Dr Mohamed Mukadam of the Association of Muslim Schools said that public suspicion about extremism remained a barrier to the setting up of more Muslim schools .
There are over 100 independent Muslim schools which could transfer into the state sector .
Division
Shadow schools minister Nick Gibb said that faith schools played an admirable role in providing choice for parents within the state education system .
" Their position needs to be strengthened and modernised in our increasingly multicultural society . "
But the support was challenged by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers .
General secretary Mary Bousted asked " why schools , in which the majority of funding comes from the state , should , as the government proposes , nurture young people in a particular faith ? "
Keith Porteous
Wood of the National Secular Society said it was " a sure - fire recipe for separation , and future conflict to encourage children to think of themselves primarily as being of a particular religion , rather than encouraging them to concentrate on what we all have in common " .
Hi , NBC .
It ’s me , Jeremy .
You probably do n’t know me , but I ’m one of your customers .
That ’s right , “ customers . ”
Two years ago , that word would n’t have made any sense to either of us .
The idea of paying money for your TV shows was next to ridiculous to me back then .
Even today , I think it ’s on the fine edge of foolish , and all it would take is one really dumb move by your company and I ’d stop paying to watch your shows .
Today , you did something that comes as close to “ really dumb ” as you ’ll need to get to lose my business entirely .
You announced that you ’re considering pulling your videos out of the iTunes Store come December over piracy and pricing concerns .
The New York Times also reported that you ’re holding back on selling movies through iTunes because you ’re worried about piracy .
TiVo ’s Series 2 DVRs can automatically record television programs for you , with almost Apple - quality simplicity
Let me explain something to you , because you do n’t seem to understand it already .
Your TV shows are available every day , every week , and every month of the year for free .
They fly through the air ( and travel through cables ) at no a la carte charge to customers .
There was also this thing called a VCR , which more recently has been replaced by something much better called a PVR ( personal video recorder ) or DVR ( digital video recorder ) , which people can rent from any cable or satellite company , or buy for their TVs or computers .
These devices record your free TV shows and let people watch them later .
With only a few button presses , people can now even record an entire season of your shows automatically and watch it whenever they want .
For free .
In other words , the per-episode price people are accustomed to paying for what you show on television is “ zero , ” or something very close to it .
Most people are also not so addicted to what you are producing that they would suddenly start paying for it if you stopped offering it for free .
In truth , I ’ve personally found it hard to convince close friends to shell out $ 1.99 on iTunes for a single episode of a show they are n’t already interested in seeing — I know , I ’ve tried , and I wind up “ gifting ” those shows half of the time .
That brings me to iTunes .
Two years ago , Apple created a place for you to sell your TV shows , and has let you try a few pricing tests since then .
I remember laughing really hard when you tried to sell individual Saturday Night Live skits for $ 1.99 per download — not because the show was funny , but because the idea of paying $ 2 to watch 3 minutes of Goat Boy or Debbie Downer was just on - its - face preposterous .
I ’ve also seen you give away content as an incentive to become interested in new shows I did n’t care much about , like Flash Gordon .
Sometimes it works .
Sometimes it does n’t .
But do n’t blame Apple .
What you should have learned from the iTunes experiment is simple :
Apple is helping you make money , and build fan bases .
Shows like
The Office that were going nowhere suddenly developed religious fans and — in my case — customers .
I missed the first and half of the second seasons of The Office because nothing you did to promote the show worked properly .
Then , one day while I was on vacation , a friend recommended the show .
So I downloaded an episode from iTunes .
Then I downloaded the entire series .
I let my now - wife watch , then she and I both got our fathers ( and other family members ) hooked , and so on .
The same thing happened with Battlestar Galactica , and this week , I bought the entire first season of Heroes .
It ’s purely coincidence , I think , that The New York Times reported this morning that those are your three most popular shows on iTunes .
Without iTunes , this would never have happened .
I want to underscore the word “ never . ”
I love these shows now , but I was completely losing interest in television until the iTunes Store made the video content conveniently available .
Like it or not , the Apple pricing and piracy provisions you ’re protesting have worked almost exactly as they should have .
Most of your customers feel that the per-episode and per season prices could stand to be a little lower , especially overseas , but somehow I doubt that you are fighting with Apple to lower your prices .
TV show prices just effectively went up in the U.K. , after all .
[ Note : Following publication of this editorial , Apple announced that NBC was attempting to force a price increase to $ 4.99 per episode . ]
NetFlix rents 3 DVDs at once for $ 17 per month , cheaper than buying DVD box sets or an entire show ’s season through iTunes
And piracy ?
If you have an objection to Apple ’s FairPlay system , let me acquaint you with the world ’s three best alternatives .
First , there ’s the DVD .
Put it into any computer , run a free program on it , and a couple of hours later , its contents can be transferred a million times over to anyone .
Sure , you make money on DVD sales , but why buy a DVD when you can just rent it ?
Next - generation video discs with more piracy protection ?
Almost no one has HD - DVD or Blu - Ray Disc players yet .
And the security on those things was already cracked , too .
Next , there ’s Bittorrent — or , put another way , massively distributed file - sharing services .
Apple takes until Friday to post Thursday ’s episodes of TV shows at 640×480 ( or lower ) resolution , charging $ 1.99 and locking the files against copying .
Bittorrent and its alternatives post the same content in high - definition for free with zero piracy protection within hours of the original airtime .
You ’d have to be stupid , lazy , or really honest to pay 2 bucks for something you can get in higher quality , with no piracy restrictions , and earlier for free .
Elgato ’s eyeTV 250 is only one of many computer - based TV and HDTV recording solutions now available
Consider me one of the “ really honest ” ones .
But I prefer the third option : the PVR .
My TiVo is now set up to record each of my favorite shows — again , for free — and I can watch them immediately after they ’re aired .
They can be stored indefinitely on my hard drive or DVDs .
Just like the millions of other people out there with PVRs , I pay nothing for this , and it ’s completely legal .
I have to admit one thing : I ’ve also been buying your DVD box sets on occasion .
The Heroes season I mentioned above ?
I purchased it this Tuesday on disc .
It did n’t seem to make any sense to me to pay $ 43 for the season at iTunes when I could buy a higher - quality box set , complete with extra features , for $ 37 at a local store .
Interestingly , my wife bought us The Office Season 2 last year , and I pre-ordered Season 3 a week or two ago — despite the fact that we have iTunes and PVR copies of the same episodes .
Also , once I ’m done watching the DVDs , I could loan them to friends .
Or sell them .
I ca n’t do either of those things with my iTunes downloads .
If you ’re concerned about piracy of what you ’re selling through iTunes , my suggestion would be to take a quick look at the fact that you ’re distributing your content in completely unprotected or compromised ways every single day .
FairPlay is the smartest , most effective protection you have .
TiVo content can be transferred to your computer for later big screen or portable viewing
So , if for some crazy , misguided reason you ultimately pull out of iTunes or try to raise your prices beyond today ’s level , two things are going to happen .
First , I ’m going to stop paying money for any of your shows , and recommend that iLounge readers do the same thing .
Seriously .
My PVR works wonderfully , so I ’ll just record for free anything that vaguely interests me , and show others how to do the same .
I ’ve been on the fine edge of greater PVR interest for the past couple of years , but the iTunes Store has mostly staved that off .
I ’ll extend this to box set DVD purchases , too ; I really do n’t need archival - quality copies of network programming I ’ve already recorded .
Second , I ’m going to decide to stop back - sampling your shows .
If something does n’t interest me at the beginning of its season , I ’m not going to pick it up mid-stream and become a loyal viewer thereafter .
Instead , I ’ll devote my interest — and my dollars — to programs from your competitors .
I hope that iLounge readers would do the same .
There are lots of channels out there , and I ’m certain that I can find great alternatives on ABC , CBS , Fox , or any of the other stations represented on iTunes .
Granted , The Office , Battlestar Galactica , and Heroes are excellent shows ; I ’d hate to give them up .
But if you leave iTunes , I wo n’t have to .
I ’ll just stop paying for them .
And I ’ll enjoy watching how your concerns over pricing and piracy work themselves out without Apple , and customers like me , on your side .
The project 's been wobbling along for 18 months .
A bottle of champagne just went to the tester who logged the one millionth bug in TestDirector ( and everybody cheered ) , the lead programmer looks like a raccoon that 's discovered a departed junkie 's heroin stash buried beneath a tree , half the programmers have quit , and the customer believes everything 's fine ...
Although it does strike him as odd that all he 's seen so far are static screenshots and Gantt charts with every single task stuck at " 90 per cent " .
The project 's in trouble .
So what does the team do ?
They 've read the IBM / Rational marketing blurb , so they firmly believe that they can " do UML " on their project and that this 'll have a miraculous effect on the bug - riddled codebase .
It 's this vague desire to start doing the right thing in order to save the project that can sink a team even further into the swamp .
When a project is in trouble because of a lack of initial analysis / design thought , the worst thing to do is to stop everything and start modelling the whole sorry mess in a CASE tool .
It seems reasonable to want to create a clear picture of where you 're at : a level playing field from which to start fixing the design .
But muddy water poured into a crystal flute is still muddy water .
Now you 've got the same dysfunctional mudball in two places - the code and the UML model .
Great .
It 's also tempting to automatically reverse - engineer the code into class diagrams using a modelling tool .
This might have an unseen benefit in that it'll shock whoever sees the resultant diagrams into realising just how bad the problem has gotten , but the diagrams themselves will be as scary as the code they 're modelled on , a jumble of criss - crossed lines and teeny - tiny overlapping boxes that could rival anything in the Tate Modern .
I 'm a great fan of UML , but like any tool or language it can be misused horribly – and usually is , because people start to use it for the wrong reasons , e.g. to do the thinking for them or make their team cleverer .
The right time for drawing diagrams is near the start of the project ( or new feature , or weekly / monthly development sprint ) when you do a little collaborative modelling with the whole team involved and figure out how it 'll all fit together .
So it 's worth emphasising : the solution is not to start modelling the existing illogical codebase in UML .
However , do map out your ideal new improved design , unfettered by the constraints and design dead - ends of the current system .
But the first thing to do ( assuming you can't just scrap it all and start over ) is cover the existing code with unit tests so you can begin refactoring your way to the new design .
But even before that , you must know what it is you 're actually designing .
Start with the basic questions :
Who 's the project for ?
What problems is it addressing ?
If you 're feeling especially virtuous today , map out some use cases and try to drive the new design from them .
Do n't be afraid to come up with something very different from what you currently have .
UML used at the right time and in the right way can work wonders - it'll set the foundations for a successful , well factored project .
But , to adapt Frederick Brooks ' famous law about the perils of adding resources to a late project , stopping to map out the bad design on a late project will just make the project later .

THE United States did n’t set out to eradicate the Mandeans , one of the oldest , smallest and least understood of the many minorities in Iraq .
This extinction in the making has simply been another unfortunate and entirely unintended consequence of our invasion of Iraq — though that will be of little comfort to the Mandeans , whose 2,000 - year - old culture is in grave danger of disappearing from the face of the earth .
The Mandeans are the only surviving Gnostics from antiquity , cousins of the people who produced the Nag Hammadi writings like the Gospel of Thomas , a work that sheds invaluable light on the many ways in which Jesus was perceived in the early Christian period .
The Mandeans have their own language ( Mandaic , a form of Aramaic close to the dialect of the Babylonian Talmud ) , an impressive body of literature , and a treasury of cultural and religious traditions amassed over two millennia of living in the southern marshes of present - day Iraq and Iran .
Practitioners of a religion at least as old as Christianity , the Mandeans have witnessed the rise of Islam ; the Mongol invasion ; the arrival of Europeans , who mistakenly identified them as “ Christians of St. John , ” because of their veneration of John the Baptist ; and , most recently , the oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein , who drained the marshes after the first gulf war , an ecological catastrophe equivalent to destroying the Everglades .
They have withstood everything — until now .
Like their ancestors , contemporary Mandeans were able to survive as a community because of the delicate balance achieved among Iraq ’s many peoples over centuries of cohabitation .
But our reckless prosecution of the war destroyed this balance , and the Mandeans , whose pacifist religion prohibits them from carrying weapons even for self - defense , found themselves victims of kidnappings , extortion , rapes , beatings , murders and forced conversions carried out by radical Islamic groups and common criminals .
WASHINGTON , March 9 — Bipartisan outrage erupted on Friday on Capitol Hill as Robert S. Mueller III , the F.B.I. director , conceded that the bureau had improperly used the USA Patriot Act to obtain information about people and businesses .
Mr. Mueller embraced responsibility for the lapses , detailed in a report by the inspector general of the Justice Department , and promised to do everything he could to avoid repeating them .
But his apologies failed to defuse the anger of lawmakers in both parties .
“ How could this happen ? ” Mr. Mueller asked rhetorically in a briefing at the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
“ Who is to be held accountable ?
And the answer to that is I am to be held accountable . ”
The report found many instances when national security letters , which allow the bureau to obtain records from telephone companies , Internet service providers , banks , credit companies and other businesses without a judge ’s approval , were improperly , and sometimes illegally , used .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Since the Federal Reserve cut two key interest rates by a half of a percentage point two weeks ago , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 5 percent .
The Dow hit a new all - time high Monday as fears of a credit crunch - induced recession appear to be waning .
The Fed got what it wanted .
Or did it ?
The markets ' reaction may actually complicate matters for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his fellow policy makers at their next scheduled meeting on Oct. 30 - 31 , and create a new conundrum - to use a word made popular by Bernanke 's predecessor , Alan Greenspan - for the Fed .
Stocks have rallied since the Fed cut interest rates on Sept. 18 on hopes that more cuts are coming .
... but bond yields have risen as well , a possible sign that fixed - income investors do n't think more rate cuts are likely .
On the one hand , it may be easy for the Fed to declare that its big rate cuts helped restore confidence in the financial markets and decide to keep the federal funds rate steady at 4.75 percent and the discount rate at 5.25 percent .
The federal funds rate , an overnight lending rate that banks charge each other , affects the rates on various types of consumer loans , while the discount rate is what it costs banks to borrow directly from the Federal Reserve .
The Fed also cut the discount rate by a half of a percentage point in a surprise move on Aug. 17 .
And since that date , the Dow is up 10 percent .
Clearly , the Fed 's actions sent a message that it is ready , willing and able to respond in times of crisis to prevent further weakening of the markets and the economy .
" What the Fed did had more to do with psychology than fundamentals .
It showed the markets it would provide liquidity and not cause the housing markets to cause more havoc , " said Jeff Cummer , president and chief portfolio manager , with SMH Capital Advisors , a Fort Worth , Texas - based money management firm .
But by moving so quickly to soothe the worries of investors , the Fed may also have raised the expectation that it will keep cutting rates .
And it may be this expectation of further rate cuts , and not the actual rate cuts themselves , that are fueling the market 's recent rally .
According to federal funds futures listed on the Chicago Board of Trade , investors are pricing in a strong likelihood of a quarter - point rate cut at the Fed 's next meeting .
Investors are pricing in a 100 percent probability that the central bank will cut rates at least once by the end of the year and that by next spring , rates could be as low as 4.25 percent .
So to use another of Greenspan 's famous expressions , investors may be once again suffering from " irrational exuberance . "
" Investors have built in expectations for another rate cut in October and future moves beyond that .
But that 's totally inconsistent with the substantial improvements in the market .
Much of the basis for the Fed 's move was to restore some of the order within the markets , " said Keith Hembre , chief economist with First American Funds in Minneapolis .
With all this in mind , what 's the Fed going to do on Halloween ?
Will it give investors a trick or a treat ?
Hembre thinks investors will be disappointed .
He said he believes the Fed will keep rates unchanged at its next meeting unless there is more data that points to a " material swoon " in the economy .
The record low pending home sales figure reported Tuesday could qualify as more evidence that the housing market woes have the potential to spill over into the broader economy .
But Hembre said the Fed could also point to " skyrocketing " oil , gold and other commodity prices as evidence that inflation is not yet dead and use that as justification for keeping rates steady .
Ted Parrish , co-manager of the Henssler Equity fund , agreed that the Fed might be able to sit tight later this month .
" It 's not a shoo - in that the Fed is going to cut again .
With the market firming up , I can see the Fed backing way from a rate cut .
With Citigroup ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and UBS ( Charts ) taking big write - offs , everyone is giddy , thinking that the worst is over , " Parrish said , referring to the fact that both bank stocks rose Monday following news of third - quarter charges due to exposure to bad subprime mortgage loans .
To cut rates again , Parrish said , the Fed will probably need to see another disappointing jobs report .
That could come Friday , when the government releases the latest employment figures .
A rise in unemployment to 4.7 percent in September from 4.6 percent in August - an increase that 's expected - could lead the Fed to lower rates in October .
" The unemployment report this Friday will play a big role in what the Fed does .
It alone wo n't dictate if the fed cuts rates but if there are fewer jobs created that will ease labor costs and make inflation less of a problem , " Parrish said .
But SMH Capital 's Cummer thinks the Fed should be more concerned with the lagging U.S. dollar , which could lead to longer - term pricing pressures .
" On a global basis , the pressure is for higher interest rates , " he said .
" The more the dollar continues to decline , the higher inflation you have .
By lowering interest rates , the Fed has actually created an inflation problem for themselves and will eventually have to raise rates again . "
Cummer added that even though fed funds futures are pointing to another rate cut , and investors in stocks are clearly banking on more cuts , he thinks the bond market does n't share that opinion .
To that end , the yield on the benchmark 10 - year U.S. Treasury has actually increased slightly since the Fed lowered rates on Sept. 18 .
" The bond market is n't sold on the idea of more rate cuts , " he said .
" People in the fixed - income market realize there is little room for the Fed to cut interest rates since the dollar is so pathetic . "
Those eyes are painted on , right ?
Right ?haha Photo : Everett Bogue
A while back we gave you the heads - up that wormwood absinthe was coming to town .
We are giddy ( read blotto from absinthe ) to report that the green fairy has touched down at certain liquor stores .
“ Lucid Absinthe has come in and is on the shelf , ready to go , ” is the good word , via e-mail , from LeNell’s .
Yesterday we called our local hookup , Park Avenue Liquor Shop , and were told , “ We got twelve bottles in this morning .
It just went like water . ”
Luckily we were able to get our trembling hands on the last $ 65 bottle ( relax , Deutsche Bankers — the store is expecting six more today ) and glub some of the stuff down at our desk ( or desks ?
There are two of them now ) .
Though it ’s best diluted with water , we drank it straight ( the building ’s fire marshal was n’t having the fire - and - sugar thing ) , and we can tell you the slightly syrupy stuff tastes like a much - spicier , somewhat - woodier version of Pernod , with a killer sinus finish .
And so Grub Street enters its “ blue period ” …

A Swedish man is to receive sickness benefits for his addiction to heavy metal music .
The lifestyle of 42 - year - old dishwasher Roger Tullgren from Hässleholm in southern Sweden has been classified as a disability by the Swedish Employment Service , which has agreed to pay part of Tullgren 's salary , and his new boss has given him special dispensation to play loud music at work .
According to Swedish online newspaper
The Local , Tullgren first developed an interest in heavy metal when his older brother bought a Black Sabbath album in 1971 .
Since then , Tullgren is a classic ( albeit softly spoken ) heavy metal head with tattoos and skull and crossbones jewellery .
Last year he attended almost 300 heavy metal shows , while playing bass and guitar in two rock bands , including Silverland .
Tullgren says he has always had difficulty holding down a job , mainly because he is absent most of the time .
Psychologists decided Tullgren 's obsession is nothing less than an addiction , which puts him in a difficult situation in the labour market .
Tullgren said he has been fighting for recognition for a long time .
Many occupational psychologists in Sweden , however , are totally baffled by the decision .
" If somebody has a gambling addiction , we do n't send them down to the racetrack .
We try to cure the addiction , " deputy employment director Henrietta Stein for the Skåne region told The Local . ®
Henry Waxman held oversight hearings on the construction of the US Embassy in Iraq .
To say that the testimony coming out is explosive and damning to the State Department is putting it mildly .
The Gavel :
The Oversight Committee ( held ) a hearing , " Allegations of Waste , Fraud , and Abuse at the New U.S. Embassy in Iraq . "
The hearing will examine the performance of the State Department and its contractors in the construction of the new $ 600 million U.S. embassy in Baghdad .
The Committee will be reviewing questions regarding the embassy compound construction as well as allegations of labor abuse through improper contracting practices .
Rory Mayberry , a former subcontractor employee for First Kuwaiti Trading & Contracting Company , gives opening testimony :
Download QT later ...
Rory Mayberry : " Mr. Chairman , when the airplane took off and the captain announced that we were heading to Baghdad , all you - know - what broke out on the airplane .
The men started shouting , it was n't until the security guy working for First Kuwaiti waved an MP5 in the air that the men settled down .
They realized that they had no other choice but to go to Baghdad .
Let me spell it out clearly : I believe these men were kidnapped by First Kuwaiti to work at the US Embassy ...
I 've read the State Department Inspector General 's report on the construction of the embassy .
Mr. Chairman , it 's not worth the paper it 's printed on .
This is a cover - up and I 'm glad that I 've had the opportunity to set the record straight . "
John Owens , a former employee of First Kuwaiti Trading & Contracting Company , gives opening testimony :
John Owens : " This was a man -camp , and by nature not the most pleasant of places to be .
But the conditions were deplorable even beyond what a working man should tolerate .
Foreign workers were packed into trailers tight , with insufficient equipment and basic needs like shoes and gloves .
If a construction worker needed a new pair of shoes he was told ' no , do with what you have ' by First Kuwaiti managers .
The contract for these workers said they had to work twelve hours a day , seven days a week , with some time off on Friday for prayers .
A few people from India told me they were making $ 240 a month ... "

Ann Coulter : Fox News is n't a conservative network David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 3 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This When Ann Coulter appeared on Joe Scarborough 's show on MSBNBC on Wednesday to promote her new book , Scarborough posed her a series of questions designed to elicit her trademark outrageous responses .
MediaMatters has been hammering NBC hard this week over regularly providing Coulter with a forum to sell her books .
On Monday , they charged that " in the weeks following the release of her last book , Godless : The Church of Liberalism ...
Coulter made numerous appearances on MSNBC , CNBC , and their parent network , NBC , where she unleashed a stream of attacks on the widows of victims of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . "
On Tuesday , MediaMatters added that " the discussion of her book on Today marks at least Coulter 's 195th appearance on an NBC - operated channel [ since 1997 ] , even though several NBC hosts and anchors -- including Tonight Show host Jay Leno , Today co-host Matt Lauer , and Nightly News anchor Brian Williams -- have expressed disapproval of Coulter 's ' harsh ' and ' nasty ' statements . "
Perhaps because of overexposure , Coulter 's responses to Scarborough appeared relatively tepid and low on the outrageousness meter .
When asked about Bill O'Reilly , she replied , " This is so hard for me , because there is no way he would defend me if the shoe were on the other foot . "
She added , however , that she believed O'Reilly 's remarks about eating in a black restaurant were " obvious " rather than racist .
When Scarborough asked her why government spending continues to increase despite the presence of many conservatives in Congress , Coulter blamed it on the voters wanting " bread and circuses , " on " the rash experiment with the 19th Amendment , " which gave women the right to vote , and on a lack of public faith in capitalism .
Coulter said of Rudy Giuliani that despite his weakness on issues dear to conservatives he still might be nominated because " he seems just crazy enough to bomb Iran .
That could carry him through . "
Coulter also insisted that Fox News " is n't really a conservative station .
What it is is a debate station .
What you see is a conservative debating a liberal , whereas on many other stations you often have lots of liberals making similar but slightly differently nuanced points . "
However , she also implied that Fox might be considered conservative after all , saying , " It 's just something conservatives like to do .
Argue . "

@JasonononOHNO :
Hmm ... that 's funny , because I 'm always thinking of how much OS X looks like linux .
@keeblerelf :
" If people want to be truly nitpicky , the reality is that Linux is n't an operating system .
It is merely a kernel . "
I take it that you do n't refer to it as GNU / Linux then ?
In my opinion , the operating system is called GNU , which may be arguable , but I certainly would n't call it by it 's distro name .
Also , I 'm more then happy to explain things about Linux , as long as I 'm able .
In fact , I 'll go as far to say that I believe Linux is all about sharing information in it 's various forms .
And when I 've said something that 's inaccurate , I 'm always grateful when someone corrects me so I do n't continue making the same mistake .
We go to Congress with the leaders we have .
Not the leaders we wished we had .
Digby on the whole ridiculous mess :
Everyone knows exactly why the Republicans sent out " statement after statement " about this obscure congressman 's words yesterday --- distraction .
Does anyone point that out ?
No .
In fact , the damned Democrats go right along with this nonsense and " hold meetings " and leak to the press about how they agree with the Republicans agreeing that Stark caused the distraction , and basically showing themselves to be a bunch of pathetic fumblers falling for this nonsense over and over again .
Surely , they do n't think they will ever be able to stop the Republicans from finding some silly comment somewhere that they can get the vapors over do they ?
Are they really battered spouses trying desperately not to say or do anything that will make their vicious , bullying batterer angry ?
Somebody call Dr. Phil for gawds sake .
I have said it before but until the Democrats figure out how to deal with this , the Republicans are going to keep doing it .
Why should n't they ?
Pelosi and Hoyer may be quaking in their boots at the thought of Republicans being so , so upset .
But real Democrats -- and not a few independents I 'd bet -- are applauding Stark and laughing at the GOP 's hypocritical crocodile tears .
Update : Ahhh , " comity and civility , GOP style .
Outside the court , Stop the War Coalition spokesman Alex Bainbridge said police had ambushed the protesters with news they would erect the King Street barrier .
" We were always under the understanding that these areas were open to the public , '' he said .
Mr Bainbridge said the coalition would meet tonight to consider its options , and that it might still go ahead with plans that would put protesters at odds with police .
" The court has made very clear that we have got a right to protest , '' he said .
" The court order today prohibits nothing , our rally and demonstration will be going ahead .
" As we have always said we intend for this to be a peaceful protest .
" We have never ruled out non-violent civil disobedience . ''
During his judgment , Justice Michael Adams agreed freedom of speech was paramount in a democratic society .
He said ending the rally at that police barrier would make it a target .
" In my view , the attitude of the Commissioner to this application is a reasonable one and accordingly I grant the orders sought , '' he said .
He agreed with police that ending the rally at King Street would cause problems because of the narrowness of the area , and the lack of exit points .
The protesters had floated an alternative " sit - down protest ' ' in front of the police line at George and King streets , after which the crowd would disperse .
But the barrister for the police , Michael Spartalis , told the court that the Commissioner would also oppose this plan .
Mr Spartalis said the Commissioner had indicated he would approve an alternative route , from Town Hall down Park Street to Hyde Park .
Earlier the court heard a police riot squad chief say Sydney should brace itself for an unprecedented level of violence during the march .
The " grave concerns ' ' of police were aired as they faced off with the Stop Bush Coalition in the court over its planned marching route .
Justice Adams strongly supported the protesters ' rights to demonstrate on what were clearly topical and important issues .
" There is presently being held in Sydney an international conference which involves a number of visiting dignitaries , '' he told the court .
" Amongst these visiting dignitaries is the President of the United States .
" Mr Bush excites perhaps indifference in some , support in others and anger in others .
" All these are feelings which no doubt have a legitimate foundation depending on the experience , character and cast of mind of the person who has them . ''
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and climate change were among the reasons behind such " strong feelings ' ' , which found their expression in public assembly and lawful protest , he said .
" All these are perfectly reasonable ; they are normal , acceptable modes of behaviour in a democracy . ''
However , Justice Adams said it would be foolish to assume everyone present at the protest would be peacefully minded .
" I do n't have any doubt that the overwhelming majority of those attending the demonstration wish to exercise their democratic right of lawful assembly and freedom of expression ... and who would abhor violence , '' Justice Adams said .
" But I think it 's Pollyanna - ish to think that everyone there will share that view . ''
In the court action , police opposed the coalition 's original protest route from Town Hall , along George Street , through Martin Place and on to Hyde Park .
However , with the barrier to be erected at George and King streets , the court heard that this route would , in any case , be blocked to the marchers .
Police said if their expectations of 20,000 marchers were met , any push against the barrier could result in " crowd crush ' ' and " horrendous consequences ' ' .
" Police lines will come under attack and a full - scale riot is probable [ if the route was approved , " Chief Superintendent Steven Cullen told the court .
Chief Superintendent Cullen told the court he held " grave concerns ' ' for public safety during the protests .
Acting for the protesters , barrister Michael Bozic rejected the police 's preferred Park Street route , saying the march aimed to highlight , among other things , the police response to APEC .

Ron Paul wins ' text messaging vote ' at Fox News debate
Republican iconoclast Ron Paul ( R - TX ) won a text messaging poll directly following the Fox News Republican debate last night .
Paul , who has polled poorly in national surveys , has a tremendous following online .
His supporters have been instrumental in demonstrating his strength on popular news voting sites like Digg.com and Reddit.com .
The Texas congressman has co-sponsored a bill with another presidential contender , Democrat Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , that would repeal President Bush 's authority to use force in Iraq within the next sixth months .
Besides Kucinich , 18 other Democrats have signed on .
Clips of his answers at the debate can be found here .
According to a seemingly authoritative report in the Washington Post , it came to pass that , on or about 2045 hours , August 30th 2007 , as the cruise missiles that had been mounted on one pylon of an Air Force B - 52  flown from Minot AFB and parked , unattended , for more than eight hours on a ramp at Barksdale AFB  were being transported to a storage area , an " airman , " a member of the transport crew , " noticed something unusual " about the missiles .
It turned out these six AGM - 129 cruise missiles were the real thing , armed with the W80 - 1 " dial - a- yield " ( 5 KT - 120KT ) nuke warhead !
The Military Times first revealed the discovery of August 30th by a lowly transport crewman on September 5th .
And as Barksdale AFB has been widely reported to be the staging base for Air Force operations in the Middle - East , and when word got out that the Israelis had staged on September 6th some sort of attack on a facility on the far side of Syria that was alleged by Bonkers Bolton to be some sort of Syrian - North Korean processing plant for nuclear materials destined for Iran , conspiracy theories blossomed .
Can it be that we have just witnessed Red Alert  the serious book on which the farcical movie Dr. Strangelove was based — in reverse ?
In the book - movie a paranoid Air Force General  believing himself near death  decides to leave the world a better place by ordering his nuke - armed B - 52 bombers who are approaching the point where they would ordinarily turn back , to go ahead and bomb their assigned targets .
The White House frantically tries to stop them , even ordering Air Force fighters to intercept the bonkers generals bombers and shoot them down .
Can it be that a lowly " airman " has thwarted one or more paranoids in the White House ?
Welcome to the world of Wayne Madsen Reports ;
" Yesterday , the Washington Post attempted to explain away the fact that America ’s nuclear command and control system broke down in an unprecedented manner by reporting that it was the result of “ security failures at multiple levels . ”
" WMR has learned that a U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and conventional weapons was scheduled to coincide with Israel ’s September 6 air attack on a reputed Syrian nuclear facility in Dayr az - Zwar , near the village of Tal Abyad , in northern Syria , near the Turkish border .
" Israel ’s attack , code named OPERATION ORCHARD , was to provide a reason for the U.S. to strike Iran .
" WMR has learned from military sources on both sides of the Atlantic that there was a definite connection between Israel ’s OPERATION ORCHARD and BENT SPEAR involving the B - 52 that flew the six nuclear - armed cruise missiles from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale . "
Wow !
Now , the Post authoritatively reports that the B - 52 was not " certified " to carry nuclear weapons .
If true , that s important .
According to the Post , the 21 - foot missiles  even when in storage  were already mounted on pylons , six apiece in clusters of three , " for quick mounting to the wings of a B - 52 . "
That presumably would mean that this particular non-certified B - 52 was not capable of being mated  electrically and mechanically  to the presumably unique pylon for carrying AGM - 129s , much less capable of arming , targeting and launching the " dial - a- yield " nuke - armed AGM - 129 .
According to the Post , a year ago SecDef Rumsfeld had ordered all 400 nuke - armed AGM - 129s to be retired and as of August more than 200 already had been .
The by - then routine procedure called for the nuke warhead to be removed in the Minot Special Weapons Storage facility and replaced with a dummy warhead of the same size and weight .
But , according to the Post , the loading of the B - 52 at Minot took eight hours because of unusual trouble attaching the pylon on the right side of the plane — the one with the dummy warheads .
Unusual trouble attaching the pylon on which the six missiles containing dummy warheads were mounted ?
No trouble at all attaching the pylon  on which the six missiles containing " dial - a - yield " nukes were mounted  to a B - 52 that was not certified ( or equipped ) to carry , arm and launch AGM - 129s ?
Doesnt that seem strange to you ?
Wouldnt that have seemed very strange to them ?
But , getting back to Waynes World .
" There is also a connection between these two events and the Pentagon ’s highly - classified PROJECT CHECKMATE , a compartmented U.S. Air Force program that has been working on an attack plan for Iran since June 2007 , around the same time that Cheney was working on the joint Israeli - U.S. attack scenario on Iran . "
Eric Margolis , a military analyst for the Canadian Sun National Media , was recently invited to the Pentagon to " brief " Project Checkmate weenies on " strategic developments " in his areas of expertise , the Middle East and South Asia .
" I asked when the Bush administration ’s widely expected air war against Iran would begin .
This was not a subject my hosts cared to discuss .
Smiles vanished .
" Dr. Lani Kass , Checkmate ’s formidable senior civilian official , a former Israeli military officer who had somehow morphed into a senior Pentagon advisor , dismissed my question , insisting no decision to attack Iran had been made .
She called a possible air war “ unlikely . ”
" But I was ready to bet plans to blitz Iran were being drawn up in an adjoining office .
" One could feel a buzz of excitement among Checkmate ’s hard - eyed officers who wore combat flight suits and tensed up every time I mentioned Iran .
" Pentagon sources say the air force has selected 3,000 - 4,000 targets in Iran , and that some U.S. and British special forces are already operating there .
" However , Washington sources also report strong opposition to war against Iran among the Pentagon ’s brass , and high - ranking officials in the CIA , Treasury , and state department .
They view war with Iran as unpredictable , unwise and dangerous at a time when U.S. ground and air forces are stretched to breaking point in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
So , Margolis also reports strong opposition to " checkmating " Iran from 20,000 feet among " Pentagons brass and high - ranking officials in the CIA . "
Well , what do they know ?
“ We can defeat Iran , ” insisted Dr. Kass , " but are Americans willing to pay the price ? ”
It s nice of her to ask .
In this YouTube , Rep. Dennis Kucinich describes the process of how , within a few weeks , he ’ll force the issue of impeachment on the floor of the U.S. House .
He does this to inform the public so that the public can assist in the process .
The likely scenario is that a congressperson will immediately make a parliamentary move to ‘ table ’ the motion .
The vote on whether to ‘ table ’ the impeachment motion WILL BE THE IMPORTANT VOTE .
If the motion is tabled , it ’s dead .
So , Kucinich is calling on every citizen ( yes , that means you ) to contact their representative to tell them to vote NOT to table the impeachment motion , but to let it be discussed on the floor of the U.S. House !

It ’s the most dreaded time of the year for insecure narcissists everywhere : the announcement of the MacArthur Foundation ’s “ genius award ” winners .
Selected in a mysterious process for which you can neither apply nor get your mom to nominate you , MacArthur fellows each receive $ 500,000 over five years , money they can spend on books or research or a new Ferrari .
On Monday , 24 new fellows were named , meaning that millions of other self - proclaimed , would - be or tragically undiscovered geniuses found themselves shunned once again .
What is , of course , especially insulting about this particular injury is that the category of “ genius ” is increasingly overcrowded .
Blame it on the democratization of intellect , the influence of HGTV or the same kind of etymological pandemonium that led to “ sick ” suddenly meaning “ cool , ” but these days , it seems , every third person is a genius .
A casual stroll down the rhetorical path of contemporary life reveals more geniuses per square mile than plain old talented people .
In the last few weeks alone , the “ genius ” moniker has been applied to NFL coach Bill Belichick , the rapper Ludacris ( courtesy of Jennifer Lopez ) , the famous mime Marcel Marceau and Alex , the African grey parrot who knew 100 English words , could count numbers up to six and who died at age 31 .
( Alex , who never received a MacArthur fellowship , was rumored to have flown -- literally -- into a rage every year when the awards were announced , once throwing an empty Scotch bottle at his keeper and other times phoning 1990 winner Susan Sontag to ask if her refrigerator was running . )
As if the Earth is n’t already buckling under the weight of human and animal geniuses , there now appears to be an influx of inanimate objects that are also possessed of preternaturally gifted traits .
As viewers of makeover and home design shows well know , pencil skirts , shag haircuts , wall stencils and the candles inside a faux fireplace can all fall into the genius category .

So too can anyone who thinks of , comments on or ( better yet ) spends money on any of these things .
This is partly because the word has branched out into adjectival territory -- “ that fiberboard credenza is genius ” -- which has made it as hyperbolically generic as “ fabulous ” and “ awesome , ” so everyone has a chance to get in on the action .
Gone are those dark days when the term was parsimoniously reserved for the scant few whose IQs or truly exceptional creative or intellectual abilities warranted such a label .
Today , “ genius ” is an equal - opportunity exaltation .
How did we end up in a world in which Albert Einstein falls into the same category as spray - on tans ?
A phone call to linguist Geoffrey Nunberg ( possibly a genius , but it ’s hard to tell without getting a look at his shoes ) shed light on a couple of points , namely that the original meaning of “ genius ” referred to the prevailing nature of a person or an idea .
( It ’s a cousin of the word “ genus , ” which has to do with taxonomic rankings within species . )
“ In Roman mythology , everybody had a god assigned to him at birth , ” Nunberg said .
“ So your tutelary god was your genius .
It had to do with the true character or nature of something and , even though it was n’t inherently complimentary , it was a way of naming an extraordinary gift .
Later , in the German Romantic period , people loved to talk about Goethe and Schiller and Milton and Shakespeare as if they were another race or something . ”
Nunberg said that in the 19th century , no one was considered famous until he was dead .
The debasement of fame , like the debasement of the term “ legend , ” has likely fed into the sudden ubiquity of geniuses .
But even if we accept that the definition of genius has expanded to roughly the size of the West Siberian Plain , how do we decide who is a genius ?
And is it possible to become one through sheer force of will ?

“ I think there ’s always some mental component , ” Nunberg said .
“ To say that Shakespeare is a genius is pretty much lodged in the language , but now baseball managers are geniuses , though that does not strike me as problematic .
But someone whose achievements are chiefly physical , where there ’s no mental agility involved , is perhaps not a genius .
More likely a quarterback than an offensive tackle -- though I ’m not sure I should be saying that since they ’re very big . ”
Ironically , even though the MacArthur Foundation has been saddled with the “ genius ” nickname since the awards began , it ’s never endorsed it because , as has been frequently reported , it sees the term as “ too limiting . ”
“ Limiting ? ” Has no one at this ostensibly esteemed organization watched HGTV ’s “ Design on a Dime ” ?
Have they not experienced the virtuosity of Ludacris ’ “ Pimpin ’ All Over the World ” ?
If they think certain spider - silk biologists and medieval historians are geniuses , they should see what a zebra - print ottoman can do for a room .
If next year ’s winners do n’t include at least one foot stool , someone ’s going to have some explaining to do .

Starting with the Coast
John Fought explains why so many Americans now speak Suthin ’ , tracing the history and geography of dialects in American speech .
Read Summary
Most Americans can tell a “ Southern accent ” from the speech patterns of other regions .
Among many sound features recognized as Southern , one in particular stands out : a distinctive pronunciation of the vowel in words such as my , high , light and nine .
In the North and West , words such as these have a -y glide after the vowel ; in the South , this -y offglide is missing some or all of the time , leading to dialect spellings such as ma , mah and so on .
Some dialectologists affectionately term this vowel “ Confederate A . ”
It is also heard sometimes in speech from areas next to the Old South , such as Oklahoma , southern Iowa , and farther west .
Regional differences in how we pronounce R sounds are another important feature of American English dialects .
Studies of American dialect geography show that R before a vowel , in words such as red , bread , raw , around , is pronounced in much the same way all over the country .
Likewise , in most of the United States , in words with an R before a consonant ( or before a pause at the end of a word or phrase ) , for example in card , fire , fork , turn , the R sounds are also pronounced .
But in a number of relatively small areas along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts , R before a consonant or pause is “ dropped . ”
That is , speakers lengthen the preceding vowel sound .
These zones of what linguists sometimes call Rless or R - dropping dialects are found in Eastern New England , including Boston ( paahk the caah ) ; in New York City , and in pockets along the coastal plains of Virginia , South Carolina , Georgia , Mississippi , Alabama , Louisiana and the Florida panhandle .
Why do Bostonians drop the r ?
Where did the “ Confederate A ” come from ?
Why do Bostonians drop the ?
The answers lie deep in our past .
These coastal plains were areas of early European settlement ; except for New York City and New Orleans , their early settlers came mainly from the Rless areas of Southeastern England , where both prestigious and popular speech varieties had become Rless shortly before emigration began .
In America , some of the aura of the Rless English prestige dialect clung to such speech through its association with the influential proprietors of the Southern plantation agricultural system and with the metropolitan speech of large Northern seaboard cities .
For a long time , however , the perceived status of American Rless dialects has been paradoxical , evoking both negative and positive stereotypes .
Putting Dialect on the Map
To understand how the coastal southern Rless zones formed , we must look at the early history of their European settlement .
The prime farmland of the tidewater zone of the South was mostly occupied by 1750 .
This was the first American zone of plantation agriculture , where farmers first grew commercial crops of rice , indigo , tobacco , and ( later on ) cotton .
Most of these crops required plenty of water for cultivation and for transportation to market .
Such pockets along the Southern coastal zone and its rivers fostered a plantation system of large - scale , capital - intensive farming , soon dominated by slave labor , in zones with rich soil , rainfall and waterways .
Along the geological break between the coastal plain and the higher piedmont to its west , the rivers have rapids or waterfalls forming the Fall Line , a barrier to easy water transport of bulk cargo .
This Fall Line , together with differences in soil type , made it disadvantageous to operate plantations in much of the inland zone .
AAVE has the greatest number of speakers of any variety of Rless Southern
What does this have to do with language ?
Differences between the agriculture of the coastal and inland zones came to be matched by other cultural differences .
Where the plantation system and its wealthy proprietors dominated , there was also a large slave population , sometimes a majority .
Millions of slave descendents , although now unevenly dispersed throughout the United States , retain a vernacular speech that isless and Southern in its vowel system .
This variety , known as African American Vernacular English , has by far the greatest number of speakers of any variety ofless Southern .
Immigration continued to shape our language .
Starting about 1750 and continuing for more than a century , Scots Irish speakers of Rful dialects from northern and western Britain emigrated to America in growing numbers for political and economic reasons .
By that time , tidewater areas and their port cities along the Southern coasts had been colonized and their farmlands taken up .
Newly arriving British Northerners , who had left family subsistence farms and small towns , found open land that suited them in the uplands of the piedmont and along the valleys and streams of the Appalachian and Allegheny mountains .
Many of them entered America through the port of Philadelphia , in that early period the largest and busiest in the nation .
Most of them moved inland west and southwest , following the rivers that were then the arteries of inland transportation .
Their part of the South was settled , in a sense , from behind .
Continuing migration helped to fill in the Inland South , extending it beyond the Mississippi to Texas , Oklahoma , Arkansas , Missouri and beyond .
Dialect maps show how language features traveled with the new Americans , taking Inland Southern down the major rivers .
A pioneering article by Raven McDavid , a great American dialect scholar brings these two layers of cultural history together as they shaped the basic patterns of coastal and inland agriculture , speech and politics in South Carolina .
That ’s NASCAR , Not NASCAH
Over the past century , it appears , the Rful inland varieties of both Northern and Southern speech have continued to gain population and influence not only within their own primary areas , but also at the expense of the Rless coastal varieties .
The changing pattern of economic concentration within the country may be driving this shift .
Whatever the reason , the cultural importance of Rful Southern now extends far beyond its old upland geographic base .
It has long been the prevailing dialect of the military services ( except possibly for the Navy ) , of NASCAR and other auto sports , and of country music , whose performers are expected to imitate it unless they are native speakers , as is Dolly Parton .
Rful Southern is naturally associated with the thriving “ Redneck ” subculture so expertly lampooned by the comedian Jeff Foxworthy , also a native speaker of Rful Southern .
In many parts of the country outside its large home territory , even where it is not the dominant dialect , it is strongly represented .
Although it is hard to be sure , it seems that not long ago , Rful Southern overtook Rful Northern as the variety of American English spoken by the greatest number of people .
To understand the basis of its growing influence in American culture and society , we need only look at major regional population ( and economic ) shifts to the Sunbelt , which have been especially strong since World War II .
Regional Population 1900 1930 2000
Total Population ( Millions ) 76.0 122.8 281.4
Northeast & Midwest 61 % 59 % 38 %
South & West 39 % 41 % 62 %
Over the past century , the main Northern dialect groups have lost about 20 percent of their share in the ever - growing population .
Southern and Western dialects , including the inland Rful group , have gained about 20 percent .
The South by itself now has a population of more than 100 million people , the largest of the four Census regions .
If we add Rful Southern speakers from parts of other adjoining states where speech is often perceived as “ Southern , ” this might shift another 10 million speakers from the Northern to the Southern count .
In time , as the Sunbelt shift continues ( allowing for the usual cultural lag ) , we should expect Rful Southern to become accepted as Standard American speech , even if this is not always true today .
One might begin to trace the cultural shift thus far through changing attitudes toward Rful Southern speech .
Consider the growth in the size and spread of the audience for Country Music and the diversification of the genre itself .
The genre began with regional performers singing in their native accent at live venues and on regional radio broadcasts .
Like jazz and the blues , it has grown into an international style with an international audience .
Among the international performers are a number of singers whose native language is not English , who imitate Inland Southern .
The roster of participants and the audience for most types of car racing is also dominated by speakers of Inland Southern .
Power of the Media ?
A common misperception is that TV will make us all sound alike
National distribution systems for voice media were first developed in the 1930s .
First came the motion picture production and distribution syndicates , followed by national radio and television networks that encouraged their performers to use standardized pronunciations .
There is a common misperception that the advent of these media led to a homogenization of American English .
But much diversity remains : we learn the foundations of our language before mass media play a major role in our lives .
It is surely significant that the emergence of early media standards did not cause America ’s decentralized , locally controlled school systems to make any serious efforts to define and impose national standards of pronunciation — as is common in many European educational systems .
What 's more , the brief and partial emergence of media standards appears to have been different in sound films and in broadcasting .
Silent films ( all that was possible until 1929 ) were at first a natural extension of the well - developed industry of theater and vaudeville .
For decades , films drew on those resources , which may help to explain the very noticeable stagy diction , much of it at least Rless Northern if not quite British , heard in many early sound films .
This stage style steadily gave way to more relaxed American pronunciations ( and acting styles ) .
A careful study by Nancy C. Elliott of a sample of American actors in American films made from the 1930s through the 1970s shows a steady decline in the average rates of R - dropping , from about 60 percent in the 1930s to zero percent in the 1970s .
Even individual performers with long careers modified their pronunciation over time .
In this , broadcasting seems to have been different from films .
Due to limited technology , radio broadcasting originally only reached local listeners , and regional varieties of speech were commonly heard over the airwaves .
( Even now , we often hear local speech varieties in local newscasts ; even more so in local commercials . )
However , once national radio networks came into being , their central offices adopted network - wide pronunciation standards for employees to use on the air .
These standards came to be based on the speech of the Inland Northeast and the Northern Midwest regions , whose dialect group , Inland Northern , had a plurality of speakers in America by the 1930s .
Rless Southern and Rless Northern are losing ground … Rful varieties are gaining
Terms
It is hard to forecast the pace and extent of the changes in usage , let alone language attitudes and expectations , that lie ahead .
It is clear , however , that for generations bothless Southern andless Northern speech have been losing ground and thatful varieties have been gaining .
It may be that in practical terms , we already have a well - established dual standard ofless Northern andless Southern , each dominant in its own region , and each accepted outside it .
If this is not yet so , it seems very likely that soon it will be .
Time will tell if Inland Southern will continue to grow in geographic and social importance until it becomes the new “ General American ” variety .
American R : a special vowel sound with lip - rounding , raising or curling back of the tip of the tongue , and raising of the back of the tongue .
Rful , Rless : these informal terms refer to the dropping or retention of R after a vowel and before a consonant or before a pause in speaking .
( CNN ) -- Ray Herrera does not mince words about what his 12 - year - old son , Jack , went through .
Jack Herrera is one of six people to die this year because of the naegleria fowleri amoeba .
" It 's beyond description to watch your most precious , beautiful , wonderful , loved one become a vegetable essentially and then die , " Herrera said .
In August , Jack returned from summer camp that included swims in Texas ' Lake LBJ .
Five days after coming home he was dead , killed by a microscopic amoeba .
" He was the happiest boy anyone ever knew , " Herrera said .
Jack is one of six people to die this summer in the United States from the naegleria fowleri amoeba .
All were believed by health officials to have contracted an infection from the amoeba from swimming in warm , freshwater lakes , rivers or natural springs .
See timeline of the sudden deaths »
There is no risk from properly chlorinated swimming pools , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The amoeba enters the human body through the nose .
It then travels to the brain , where it begins to feed .
Symptoms of the amoeba 's rampage begin 1 to 14 days after infection and resemble the flu .
At the onset of those symptoms the amoeba victim 's health swiftly declines .
Watch how to reduce risk of contracting the amoeba »
At this point , says Dr. Kevin Sherin of the Orange County Health Department who is investigating three deaths this summer in Florida , " It 's progressing very rapidly and then there 's a downhill course for them there .
Folks lapse into a coma , there are abnormal movements of the eyes and a terrible cascade of events leading to the actual death of parts of the brain . "
Although exposure to the amoeba is usually fatal , Sherin says a cocktail of drugs can fight the amoeba if administered in time .
The key , he says , is identifying the amoeba early .
In the hot summer months when the amoeba flourishes , he said , doctors need to learn to look for the symptoms of an amoeba - related illness .
" Physicians have to consider it .
The public needs to consider it , " Sherin said .
" If you have a flu - like illness or a bad headache following swimming in a freshwater body and the temperature is over 80 degrees Fahrenheit , be aware of this . "
However , only a handful of doctors have seen a patient with the rare amoeba .
Until this summer there were only 24 known cases of it in the U.S. since 1989 , according to the CDC .
Health officials cannot explain the spike in cases this summer , except that weather plays a factor .
" Because it 's been such a hot summer , that has contributed to warmer water temperatures and lower water levels and that makes an ideal environment for the amoeba , " said Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine of the Arizona Department of Health , which is investigating a death last month there tied to the amoeba .
Another question health officials have is why the amoeba seems to appear more often in young males .
All six victims this summer were male , ages 10 to 22 years old .
One theory , the CDC says , is that young males might be more likely to engage in water sports such as water skiing or wakeboarding .
Those can lead to greater exposure to the amoeba .
But other than wearing nose plugs while swimming or staying out of freshwater above 80 degrees Fahrenheit , there is little people can do to prevent exposure to the amoeba .
Health officials say federal or local governments have few tools to combat the amoeba .
Even testing the water for amoeba levels , said the CDC's Dr. Michael Beach , would be of minimal benefit to swimmers .
" It would be very difficult because the testing procedures would n't tell you what 's going on until days after people would actually be in that water . "
Beach said this week on CNN's American Morning .
" So , you have to assume that it 's there and try and reduce these risks even further .
This is an extremely rare infection , so we have to keep that in perspective as well , although it 's very severe , " Beach said .
In Orange County , Florida , county health department officials have rejected calls to close the lakes this summer .
Dr. Kevin Sherin said the department does not have the authority to deny access to public lakes and that privately owned lake areas would remain open regardless of any action to close the lakes .
Instead , the health department has posted signs at 15 swimming and boating areas where people may face exposure to the amoeba .
The effectiveness of the signs appears mixed .
When a CNN crew recently visited a bathing area near a natural spring , the water was packed with families .
As he sunbathed near a sign warning of amoebas , John Walters seemed unconcerned about danger possibly lurking beneath the clear , inviting waters .
" It 's no worse I suppose than the gator signs over there and somebody did get attacked here once . "

BBC News , Vanuatu
It is a regular bank in almost every respect .
It has accounts , reserves , cheque books and tight security .
It also pays a handsome 15 % interest and offers mortgages and easy credit .
The Tari Bunia Bank accepts unusual deposits
But the 14 branches of the Tari Bunia Bank , spread around the lush forests of Vanuatu 's remote Pentecost Island , deal in a very special sort of currency .
" I have come to make a deposit , " said Vira Sanialo , clutching a hand woven mat and a small pig 's tusk .
The manager , Chief Viraleo Boborenvanua , leaned across his desk and peered carefully at the tusk .
He would need to weigh it , he explained , but the two items would be credited promptly to Vira Sanialo 's 10 - year savings account .
For centuries , Pacific islanders have used tusks , mats , shells and even giant rocks as currency for trading and ceremonial purposes .
But the Tari Bunia Bank is now taking that custom to a new level of sophistication - and helping to protect Vanuatu 's isolated traditional communities from the harsher imperatives of modern capitalism .
Using the land
Chief Viraleo dealt with his last customer then walked through the wooden hut to the bank 's vault .
Thousands of pig tusks hung from the walls , tied up with string salvaged from the rocky coastline below the village of Lavatmagemu .
" The system works , " he explained , " from the natural resources we have - the products of the land and the sea .
All are valued and converted into our currency .
Our aim is to make sure there is no poverty in our communities . "
The local currency here is called the Livatu .
Chief Viraleo and his colleagues have valued it at approximately one Livatu to $ 180 ( £ 89 ) .
By that reckoning , the bank has almost $ 1bn in its reserves .
Not surprisingly , perhaps , Vanuatu 's government has yet to agree to an official exchange rate .
But it has taken one important step towards it .
Islanders can now pay for school fees with animal skulls and the like
Just up the hill from the bank , a small queue was forming outside the Atavtabanga state primary school .
An elderly man stood patiently , clutching a pig 's skull and tusks .
In front of him , Virangiri was handing over an elaborately woven " money mat " to the school treasurer .
It was , he explained , payment for his 12 - year - old daughter Jenila 's fees .
State education is not free in Vanuatu .
Neither are local clinics .
But many traditional communities simply do not earn the hard cash needed to pay for these services .
Shanty towns have begun to emerge around the capital , Port Vila , as families move from the islands in search of access to the modern economy .
Hunger and unemployment - unheard of in traditional communities - are growing .
But at the Atavtabanga school , up to 50 parents now pay their children 's fees in traditional money .
" It has made a big difference , " said the headmaster , George Leo .
" In the past we had problems with fees , but now it 's easier for kids to finish school . "
Tackling poverty
For years , campaigners have urged the government to pay more attention to Vanuatu 's traditional economy .
Official statistics show the country is one of the world 's poorest and least developed .
But Selwyn Garu , secretary of the National Council of Chiefs , said those figures fail to take account of " 80 % of the population who live under another system .
The government is focusing on the Western capitalist system .
But we feel that is not justice . "
A survey last year found Vanuatu was the world 's happiest country
In response , Vanuatu 's government has now declared 2007 the " year of the traditional economy " .
The move has been welcomed by many people here who are keen to ensure that Western notions of " progress " are not imposed on the country 's stable and sophisticated traditional communities .
As foreign developers rush to buy up the coastline around Port Vila , some are not convinced .
" In my heart this is still paradise , " said Ricky Taleo , 29 , watching builders carve up the shoreline in front of his village for a new resort .
" But the happiness is fading away slowly .
And I guess in a couple of years it 's going to turn into a dump . "
But on the more remote Pentecost Island , the outside world is still being kept at arms length .
Before heading to the village hall for a lunch of yams cooked in a stone oven , and fresh seaweed , Chief Viraleo closed and bolted the doors to the bank .
So far there have been no robberies .
All the branches , he explained with a chuckle , were guarded by spirits and snakes .
I ’ve been trying out the test version of Picasa that publishes web albums and lets you geotag photos with Google Earth .
I imported some photos of Stockholm , geotagged them , and published them as a web album .
I ’m completely impressed .
The process manages to combine absolute ease of use with all the power that Google Earth now musters .
It took me no time at all to pinpoint seven photos to within a meter ’s accuracy , and I found myself smiling at the ingenuity of it all .
Here ’s how it works :
Start with some imported photos .
Highlight them .
Go to the Tools menu , select Geotag > Geotag with Google Earth .
Google Earth pops up with big crosshairs at the center of the screen .
At the edge of the screen , a floating window that shows you the photo you need to georeference .
Drag the Earth .
Click .
Next .
Repeat until done .
Placemark icons are generated automatically from the image , and the collected whole is turned into a folder ready for export as KML .
( Here is the KMZ file of the Stockholm photos . )
Once Done , Picasa marks the photo icons with a small symbol , denoting that they have been geotagged .
Publishing them to a web album is just as seamless .
Push a button , log in to your Google account , choose a name and whether your folder is public , and you ’re done .
in fact , once you have a Picasa Web Album account , you do n’t even need the Picasa standalone application .
You can upload photos directly , via the web client , albeit without Picasa ’s georeferencing abilities .
There is still room for development , of course .
The public web albums do not yet offer up a KML link for georeferenced photos , and the RSS feed that accompanies the photos does not do GeoRSS .
Integration with Google Maps would also make sense , in case you ’re travelling and want to georeference your roadrip pictures .
I ’m sure it ’s just a matter of time .
The integration between Picasa and Google Earth is the first instance I can think of from the past year where Google develops something geo-savvy that risks competing with the freelance developers in its ecosphere .
There are other tools out there that use Maps and Earth to georeference photos , mainly connected to Flickr , but also dedicated ones , like Panoramio .
( Panoramio ’s strengths lie elsewhere , though — in social mapping . )
In this case , however , the advantage of the ease of use of the integration is so great , that anyone using Google Earth should download Picasa , and anyone with Picasa should download Google Earth .
And that ’s precisely how the game is won against Microsoft and Yahoo ! .
What about Apple ’s iPhoto ?
That only integrates with .
Mac ’s web publishing , for which you pay , and there are no georeferencing tools in sight .
Picasa is looking far more interesting at the moment .
Luckily , my MacBook Pro boots into Windows : -)
With some sort of " meeting " or " conference " to kick start the peace process now being touted by the Bush administration , there is at least the appearance of an understanding in Washington of the importance for the region and the world of solving the " Palestinian problem . "
However , if this problem is ever to be solved , it must be redefined .
Those who truly seek justice and peace in the Middle East must dare to speak openly and honestly of the " Zionism problem " – and then to draw the moral , ethical , and practical conclusions that follow .
When South Africa was under a racial - supremacist , settler - colonial regime , the world recognized that the problem was the ideology and political system of the state .
Anyone outside the country who referred to the " black problem " or the " native problem " ( or , for that matter , to the " white problem " ) would instantly have been branded a racist .
The world also recognized that the solution to that problem could not be found either in " separation " ( apartheid in Afrikaans ) and scattered native reservations ( called " independent states " by the South African regime and Bantustans by the rest of the world ) or in driving the settler - colonial group in power into the sea .
Rather , the solution had to be found – and to almost universal satisfaction was found – in democracy , in white South Africans growing out of their racial - supremacist ideology and political system and accepting that their interests and their children 's futures would be best served in a democratic , non-racist state with equal rights for all who live there .
The solution for the land which , until it was literally wiped off the map in 1948 , was called Palestine is the same .
It can only be democracy .
The ever - receding " political horizon " for a decent two - state solution , which , on the ground , becomes less practical with each passing year of expanding settlements , bypass roads , and walls , is weighed down by a multitude of excruciatingly difficult " final status " issues .
Israeli governments have consistently refused to discuss these final - status issues seriously , preferring to postpone them to the end of a road which is never reached – and which , almost certainly , is intended never to be reached .
Just as marriage is vastly less complicated than divorce , democracy is vastly less complicated than partition .
A democratic post - Zionist solution would not require any borders to be agreed , any division of Jerusalem , anyone to move from his current home , or any assets to be evaluated and apportioned .
Full rights of citizenship would simply be extended to all the surviving natives still living in the country , as happened in the United States in the early 20th century and in South Africa in the late 20th century .
The obstacle to such a simple – and morally unimpeachable – solution is , of course , intellectual and psychological .
Traumatized by the Holocaust and perceived insecurity as a Jewish island in an Arab sea , Israelis have immense psychological problems in coming to grips with the practical impossibility of sustaining forever what most of mankind views as a racial - supremacist , settler - colonial regime founded upon the ethnic cleansing of an indigenous population .
Indeed , Israelis have placed themselves in a virtually impossible situation .
To taste its bitter essence , Americans might try to imagine what life in their country would be like if the European settlers had not virtually exterminated the indigenous population and if almost half of today 's American population were Indians , without basic human rights , impoverished , smoldering with resentment , and visible every day as the inescapable living evidence of the injustice inflicted on their ancestors .
This would not be a pleasant society in which to live .
Both colonizers and colonized would be progressively degraded and dehumanized .
The colonizers could , rationally , conclude that they could never be forgiven by those they had dispossessed and that no " solution " was imaginable .
So it has been , and continues to be , in the lands under Israeli rule .
Perhaps the coming " meeting " or " conference " will be the last gasp of the fruitless pursuit of a separation - based solution .
Perhaps those who care about justice and peace and believe in democracy can then find ways to stimulate Israelis to move beyond Zionist ideology toward a more humane , hopeful , and democratic view of present realities and future possibilities .
No one would suggest that the moral , ethical , and intellectual transformation necessary to achieve a decent one - state solution will be easy .
However , more and more people now recognize that a decent two - state solution has become impossible .
It is surely time for concerned people everywhere – and particularly for Americans – to imagine a better way , to encourage Israelis to imagine a better way , and to help both Israelis and Palestinians to achieve it .
It is surely time to seriously consider democracy and to give it a chance .

A missing Haskell feature ?
Haskell 98 + Hierarchical modules is pretty much feature complete as far as I 'm concerned .
I realise that most people would demand to add higher ranked types and multi- parameter type classes , but the only extension I 'm crying out for is pattern guards .
However , there is one operation that I think would be useful - pattern equality .
Consider the data type :
> type RegExp = [ Atom ]
> data Atom = Atom String | Star String
Now imagine you want to check that all atoms in a regular expression are Star's .
Easy enough in Haskell :
> all is Star r
Unfortunately the definition of isStar - something that is conceptually very simple - is rather verbose :
> isStar ( Star _ ) = True
> isStar _ = False
The reason is that in Haskell pattern matching is used to control program flow , not as an expression .
One extension I often find myself wanting is some kind of " pattern match equality " .
Stealing the ~= operator for the moment , imagine :
> all ( ~= Star _ ) r
The ~= operator can be seen as pattern equality .
It can be given a very simple semantics :
> x ~= y === case x of {y ->
True ; _ ->
False}
Of course , now you 've got pattern matching in there , its natural to allow fuller pattern matching :
> all ( ~= Star x | null x ) r
Note that the original pattern match desugaring still allows this to be valid .
What do people think of this suggestion ?
Do people think it would be generally useful ?
Disclaimer :
This is not a carefully thought out feature proposal .
Stealing ~= for syntax is completely unacceptable , something like
On the heels of reports of a very disappointing second quarter fund raising effort , there are reports that he is considering accepting federal matching funds to make up for the shortfall :
A second consecutive disappointing fundraising quarter is leading the campaign of Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) to consider accepting federal matching funds in the primary , campaign manager Terry Nelson told reporters Monday .
â€ œIncorrect assumptions , â€ unpopular political stances and a tough fundraising environment were responsible for McCainâ€™s second - quarter total of $ 11.2 million , the campaign said .
That total is below an already disappointing first quarter , in which the senator raised $ 13.6 million .
Whatâ€™s more , McCain only has $ 2 million cash on hand .
Perhaps more painfully , reports came out just before a conference call Monday with reporters that the McCain campaign will lay off about 50 staff members .
Nelson said during the conference call that the campaign incorrectly assumed it would be able to raise $ 100 million for the primary .
Thus far , McCain has raised only $ 24 million and spent most of it .

Police may reopen 36 - year - old case after nightclub boss claims rock star was killed by heroin overdose and that drug dealers launched cover - up by moving body
For more than three decades it has remained one of rock music 's most tantalising mysteries .
Why did Jim Morrison , legendary lead singer of The Doors , suddenly collapse and die in his Paris apartment , aged only 27 ?
The official death certificate states he died in the bath of " natural causes " .
But now , in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday , a former close friend of the singer says he knows the truth .
According to Sam Bernett , Morrison died of a massive heroin overdose in the toilet of a nightclub he was managing , the Rock ' n ' Roll Circus on the French capital 's fabled Left Bank .
Bernett , 62 , a French - born former New York Times journalist , claims the death was then covered up by two drug dealers who transferred Morrison 's body from the club to the singer 's apartment and dumped it in the bath .
Bernett was then warned by the club 's owners never to tell anybody about what he had seen .
This extraordinary testament is contained in Bernett 's forthcoming book " The End - Jim Morrison " soon to be published in France .
The allegations are being taken so seriously that they are being examined by the French authorities and may lead to the investigation into Morrison 's death being reopened .

Jim Morrison first arrived in Paris in March 1971 .
One of the most widely - recognised stars in the world , thanks to hits such as Break on Through and Light My Fire , he had just finished recording what was to become The Door's
most popular album , LA Woman .
He lived a notoriously wild life , abusing both alcohol and drugs , and soon became a regular at the Rock ' n ' Roll Circus , a club frequented by the Beatles , Rolling Stones , Pink Floyd , Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix .
It also played host to trapeze artists and , on one memorable occasion , a live tiger and monkeys from a nearby circus .
In the early hours of 3 July 1971 , the underground disco was heaving with 500 revellers , including 24 - year - old British siren Marianne Faithfull who had recently split up with Mick Jagger .
Morrison , who was living in Paris with his girlfriend Pamela Courson , arrived at about 1am .
" I greeted Jim as I always did , " recalled Bernett from his home in Paris .
" He did n't look in great form , and immediately went to his usual spot at the bar and ordered a bottle of vodka .
He was also drinking beers .
" I was used to talking about everything with him - from Janice Joplin to the beatniks - but that night it was just a bit of small talk .
" He 'd come in to pick up heroin for Pam .
He was always collecting drugs for her and the club was full of dealers . "

According to Bernett , Morrison bought the heroin from two men working for Jean de Breteuil , a French playboy and drug dealer .
" The dealers who Jim was talking to were well known , " said Bernett .
" Both were French guys in their 20s .
I knew what they were up to , and kept an eye out for Jim .
He disappeared to the toilets at around 2am .
" Then , about half an hour later , a cloakroom attendant came up to me and told me someone was locked in one of the cubicles and was n't coming out .
It was then that I got a bouncer to smash the door down . '
Bernett was met by the sight of Morrison 's body , slumped on the toilet .

In his book , he writes : " I recognised the US Army combat jacket and the riding boots from the Camargue region of France which he never took off .
It was Jim Morrison , with his head between his knees , his arms dangling .
" For a few seconds our eyes were glued to the unmoving corpse .
We were mesmerised by the baffling spectacle .
" The flamboyant singer of The Doors , the cool and good - looking Californian guy , was now a collapsed and inert lump lying in a nightclub toilet .
" Seeing Jim in such a bad way was pretty awful .
We were certain he'd been snorting heroin because there was foam coming out of his lips as well as blood .
He was scared of needles so never injected drugs .
He just snorted them . "
Bernett 's first reaction was to send for one of his regular customers , a doctor .
The medic , who Bernett refuses to name , " recognised Morrison but kept his cool .
Very calmly , and expertly , he examined the body for a few seconds .
Scroll down for moe
" He pushed Jim 's head back , lifted his eyelids , opened his mouth , and fixed his ear to his chest to listen to his heartbeat .
He looked for marks and bruises on the body and the arms .
" It was a quick and professional examination .
His diagnosis was very confident : ' This man is dead .
Apparently the victim of a cardiac arrest . '
The doctor was not stupid and spoke of a lethal overdose . "
In the meantime , Morrison 's two " friends " from the bar who had sold him the heroin had arrived .
Ignoring the doctor 's verdict , they insisted the singer ' had just fainted ' and they would take care of him .
Then , according to Bernett , they lifted Morrison 's body out of the toilets and along a corridor that linked the Circus with Alcazar , the club next door which still exists today .
That was the last Bernett saw of the body but , from Alcazar , he says it would have been easy to place Morrison in a car or van waiting in the small side street outside , and then take the body to the singer 's apartment across the river in Rue Beautreillis .
Minutes after the tragedy , a representative of the club 's owner - a well - connected Paris businessman called Paul Pacini still alive , we are trying to get a comment from him ] - warned Bernett not to tell anyone what had happened .
Bernett says : " I was told , " Since Morrison 's friends want to take him with them , we have nothing more to do with this story .
" The club has no responsibility for what happens here .
It was a sad accident , certainly , but that 's fate .
So we saw nothing , we heard nothing , we shut up !
OK ?
It 's what we better do to avoid a scandal . "
Bernett adds that he saw little point in calling the emergency services , as he was convinced Morrison was already dead and nothing could be done for him .
And he says anyone else in the club that night who had an inkling of what went on - including Marianne Faithfull - was also sworn to secrecy .
Incredibly , after Morrison 's body was found in his apartment , no proper investigation into his death was carried out .
Pamela Courson , Morrison 's girlfriend since they were at university together in Los Angeles , swore on oath that her lover had been alive and well the night before .
She told police they had been to the cinema together and then returned home at 1 am - the time Bernett claims Morrison was arriving at The Circus - where she did the washing up and he watched a film , before they retired to bed to listen to music .
Then , in the middle of the night , Morrison had woken up coughing and she had watched him leave the room to take a bath " and relax " .
Max Vassille , a compliant French doctor , was happy to write off Morrison 's demise as " death from natural causes " , pointing out that the singer had been suffering from a serious stomach ulcer and asthma attacks after moving from America earlier in the year .
He ruled that no autopsy was required , as there was " no evidence of foul play " .
Vassille and Pamela Courson have both since died .
Morrison 's official death report , still filed at Paris town hall , has been used ever since to quash countless conspiracy theories ranging from security agency plots to theories that Morrison faked his own death to escape the trappings of fame .
As for Marianne Faithfull , Bernett says she and Jean de Breteuil left Paris for Morocco the moment they heard about Morrison 's death .
" De Breteuil was Pam 's dealer , and had supplied the heroin on the night , " said Bernett .
" He and Marianne immediately packed their bags and headed for Casablanca , where De Breteuil had relatives .
They did n't want to hang about .
" Marianne never mentioned Jim again .
She wo n't talk about what happened in the club to this day . "
The Mail on Sunday contacted Marianne Faithfull but she was unavailable for comment .
De Breteuil died of an overdose not long after Morrison .
Bernett , a former journalist who now presents programmes on French national radio , says he has finally decided to break his silence despite risking prosecution for covering up the death in his club .
" I was 26 in 1971 , " he said .
" Today , I 'm past 60 , and want to get rid of my heavy load .
At least everything is now out there to be discussed .
I 've said what I have to say . "
According to French law , criminal cases cannot be reopened after 20 years have lapsed .
However , civil law - as well as international law - may provide an opportunity for investigators to re-open the case .
A spokesman for France 's Police National said : " The new evidence will have to be considered .
In case DRM has n't caused you -- the honest consumer -- enough pain already .
Check it , you 've got some required software updating to do now that Corel has introduced a patch to their cracked InterVideo WinDVD software .
Best do it pronto too .
According to Corel , " failure to apply the update will result in AACS - protected HD DVD and BD playback being disabled . "
That means no more hi-def movies for you , Mr. assumed criminal .
Thing is , this is no ordinary patch since WinDVD exposed the hardware specific device key to video pirates .
So not only are you required to update their janky WinDVD software , you also have to track down and install the paticular AACS patch for the HD DVD or BD player you own .
Of course this only patches one flaw in the massively compromised DRM boondoggle .
And just think , you can repeat the whole process again after hackers circumvent this latest attempt at " content protection . "
Is n't DRM nice ?

Dud spreadsheet threatens case By Leonie Wood November 10 , 2005 A MULTIMILLION - DOLLAR petrol price - fixing case being led by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in the Federal Court has been seriously jeopardised by admissions from it that one of its investigators made up some of the evidence .
The ACCC is relying on a huge spreadsheet which lists petrol prices and times of price changes to corroborate oral evidence from witnesses , including some of the petrol station operators , that Geelong fuel retailers worked together to push up prices in 1999 and 2000 .
ACCC 's chief investigator Jane Edwards admitted that " at the risk of fingering one of my staff members " , one of the investigators had cut and pasted slabs of data into the spreadsheet .
Ms Edwards at the time told the court that the investigator was " very enthusiastic and he thought he had skills that we were n't aware of that might be of use " , so he hurdled the problem that the ACCC lacked information about price movements on some dates by duplicating data from other dates .

064 ) NASA misstated by $ 644 M : undetected spreadsheet errors in " ad hoc " process

Government Accounting Office Report ; Mar 30 , 2001
http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=5014
Testimony of Gregory D . Kutz , GAO
GAO report number GAO - 04 - 754T entitled ' National Aeronautics and Space Administration : Significant Actions Needed to Address Long- standing Financial Management Problems ' " NASA 's fiscal year 1999 SBR was misstated by a reported $ 644 million due , in part , to a misinterpretation of guidance and errors in NASA 's ad hoc process for generating budgetary information .
As a result , the NASA locations used various methods to extract the data for this line item from their separate systems and entered the data on spreadsheets , which were then compiled by NASA headquarters .
... NASA officials have indicated that undetected errors in this spreadsheet process - in addition to the inclusion of the erroneous category of transactions - were also responsible for a portion of the SBR misstatement .
According to NASA officials , they have strengthened internal controls over this process for fiscal year 2000 .
Arthur Andersen did not detect the error in NASA 's SBR during its audit of the fiscal year 1999 financial statements .
Evidence in Arthur Andersen 's working papers relating to understanding and testing internal controls and validating underlying data for key financial statement balances was not adequate to support Arthur Andersen 's unqualified audit opinion ' on the SBR and Statement of Financing for fiscal year 1999 .
...
The other errors of approximately $ 32 million related to errors in the spreadsheet data may have had an impact on the P&F Schedules . "

In a loan dispute , a spreadsheet prepared by a claimant sought to calculate the total interest due under the loan .
A mistake was not discovered during the negotiations and , in due course , the parties agreed a settlement figure of £ 55,000 on the mutually mistaken assumption that this equated to a rate of interest of about 45 % .
In truth , £ 55,000 equated to an interest rate of approximately 33 % .

A well - known Grand Rapids investment manager 's alleged mishandling of stock orders has led to $ 475,000 in fines by the New York Stock Exchange and censures for him and two other employees involved in the orders .
The stock exchange said Cusack , 47 , bought large blocks of Foremost stock in September and October of 1999 , but did n't properly document which of his clients would have the stock placed in their accounts .
The lack of documentation raised the possibility that he could wait to decide how to distribute the shares until he knew how the shares performed that day -- a violation of NYSE rules and Securities and Exchange Commission laws .
Cusack told the stock exchange he had a spreadsheet that spelled out how the stock would be distributed when the orders were placed , but the spreadsheet was thrown away after the transactions and other documentation were completed .

017 ) Economic Testimony - The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly
Article : http://www.rrc-inc.com/articles_economic_testimony.php ( undated )
" There are times in which the economic expert is either unprepared or led into difficult positions .
Likewise , there are times in which the cross examination opens the door for further damaging economic testimony .
Over the years , we have compiled a list of some of the goofs and some of the successes among economic experts we have observed . " .
What spreadsheet ?
During trial the plaintiff 's attorney during cross examination focused upon the computer spreadsheet used by the defense 's economic expert to allegedly prove that there were zero economic damages .
The expert had relied heavily upon research assistants to construct the spreadsheet , but under the expert 's supervision .
Unfortunately , the expert had not carefully examined the calculations and was not aware of several calculation errors .
The spreadsheet was blown up as a trial exhibit , along with an alternate spreadsheet with corrected figures .
The expert 's testimony at trial was inconsistent with the corrected spreadsheet .
The expert was forced to acknowledge to the court the calculation error , and tried to explain it was not a serious one .
Yet it was too late .
The jury lost confidence in the testimony .
The jury awarded the plaintiff more than $ 12 million in damages .
Did you copy all the way down ?
A plaintiff 's economic expert was claiming that damages were to accrue over an extended period of time due to a permanently damaged reputation .
Due to an incorrect use of a copy command in the spreadsheet , the lost profits after the tenth year of the projection became discontinuous , abruptly decreasing in one month , then following a smooth trend upward though the remainder of the time horizon .
The economist had revised the spreadsheet , but failed to copy the revision down all cells , stopping after ten years .
The remainder of the projection used the unrevised formula which abruptly took the profits into the negative regions .
Since the profits were projected for a surgeon , it made little economic sense that a surgeon would continue practicing for several years with a negative income .
Upon questioning in the deposition , the expert could not quickly figure out the reason for the questions and admitted that , if the projection showed it , it was quite possible for profits to be negative for short periods of time .
Problems and inconsistencies could have been detected by the expert by simply graphing the result .
However , the expert chose not to admit the possibility of a mistake in a deposition and provided damaging testimony instead .

NASA 's STEREO satellite captured the first images ever of a collision between a solar " hurricane " , called a coronal mass ejection ( CME ) , and a comet .
The collision caused the complete detachment of the comet 's plasma tail .
Comets are icy leftovers from the solar system 's formation billions of years ago .
They usually hang out in the cold , distant regions of the solar system , but occasionally a gravitational tug from a planet , another comet , or even a nearby star sends them into the inner solar system .
Once there , the sun 's heat and radiation vaporizes gas and dust from the comet , forming its tail .
Comets typically have two tails , one made of dust and a fainter one made of electrically conducting gas , called plasma .
CMEs are large clouds of magnetized gas ejected into space by the sun .
They are violent eruptions with masses upwards of a few billion tons traveling anywhere from 100 to 3,000 kilometers per second ( 62 to 1,864 miles / second ) .
They have been compared to hurricanes because of the widespread disruption they can bring when directed at Earth ; CMEs are known to cause geomagnetic storms that can present hazards for satellites , radio communications , and power systems .
Comet Encke was traveling within the orbit of Mercury when a CME scrunched the tail and eventually tore it off the comet .
Scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory ( NRL ) made the observations using the Heliospheric Imager ( HI ) in NRL's Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation ( SECCHI ) telescope suite aboard NASA 's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ( STEREO ) - A spacecraft .
Scientists have been aware of this spectacular phenomenon , the disconnection of the entire plasma tail of a comet , for some time .
However , the conditions that lead to these events remained a mystery .
Scientists suspected that CMEs could be responsible for some of the disconnection events , but the interaction between a CME and a comet had never been directly observed .
Because the HI instrument can take many images rapidly , and the images are very detailed , scientists were able to obtain a series of images of the comet and tail disconnection as the event occurred .
The researchers combined the images into a movie .
This never - before - seen movie was recorded on April 20 , 2007 , when a CME encountered comet Encke .
The observations reveal the brightening of the comet tail as the CME swept by and its subsequent disconnection and transport by the CME front .

This is a still taken from an animation showing Comet Encke and the coronal mass ejection erupting from the surface of the Sun .
A preliminary analysis suggests that the tail was ripped away when magnetic fields bumped together in an explosive process called " magnetic reconnection . "
Oppositely directed magnetic fields around the comet " bumped into each " by the magnetic fields in the CME .
Suddenly , these fields linked together - they " reconnected " - releasing a burst of energy that rent the comet 's tail .
A similar process takes place in Earth 's magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms fueling , among other things , the Northern Lights .
" The comet had its own space weather event , " said Angelos Vourlidas , Lead author and Researcher with the Naval Research Laboratory , Washington , DC .
" We think it experienced a magnetic reconnection event very similar to what Earth experiences when CMEs impact our own protective magnetosphere . "
The results are published online today in the Astrophysical Journal Letters Rapid Release website and in the October 10 print issue of the journal .
A result has been a freezing up of markets for many securities that , it turns out , were critical to the free flowing of credit .
The problem first gained widespread attention when two hedge funds run by the brokerage firm Bear Stearns collapsed and a third Bear Stearns fund had to suspend redemptions as investors sought to get out even though there was no evidence that the fund was in trouble .
“ The third Bear Stearns fund announcement was the key , ” said Robert Barbera , the chief economist of ITG .
“ You have to believe that in the hedge fund and mutual fund complexes , there is a decision that is building that says , ‘ I want to hold some Treasuries to have a cushion if I see redemptions . ’ ”
The basis of the system was a belief that securities backed by bad credit could be very safe — so long as there were other securities that would suffer the first losses that came from defaults in pools of subprime mortgages or of loans to highly leveraged companies .
So far , none of those highly rated securities have failed to make their interest payments on time , but that fact is not enough to make anyone want to buy them .
The rating agencies have downgraded some securities , and they are tightening their standards for new ratings .
Early this week , stock market investors around the world tried to reassure themselves that nothing was really wrong , and financial stocks bounced back after suffering sharp declines last week .
Analysts argued that profits remained strong , as does world economic growth .
On Tuesday , the Fed declined to lower the federal funds rate , saying that despite financial market volatility and a decline in the housing market , “ the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters , supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy . ”
But that comforting outlook did not help the credit markets recover , or persuade anyone to buy the newly questioned securities — at least at anything like the prices people had assumed .
No one wants to sell the securities at very low prices — and in many cases they have borrowed heavily against them .
So the markets have dried up .
Global finance is a tricky business .
If you want some quick cash you need to borrow it from a lender .
That lender , with lots of other customers , probably needs to borrow some cash from some other lender , so it offsets the loan with a deal based on government or corporate bonds .
The value of those bonds will depend on the government or the corporate entity having sufficient collateral and growth to guarantee a return on investment at least as good as the original cash loan rate .
The lender also tops up its own capital base by making investments , in the form of equities , bonds or other more unusual instruments .
The pension schemes operated by companies throughout the world invest in the same august bodies that the lenders loan virtual money to .
Someone panics – he sees problems on the horizon , and advises his customers to sell stocks in the original lender .
The value of that lender falls ; other investors see the fall and sell their customers ’ stocks ; the lender ’s stock falls quicker .
Savers see the value of their bank falling and decide to pull money out of their accounts .
A ‘ crisis ’ is announced .
The regulators are blamed .
The investors are blamed .
The central bank is blamed .
The government is blamed .
No one blames the system .
Look here .
The Financial Times has a solution :
Currently liquid banks are reluctant to make interbank term loans today , even at nearly 7 per cent , because they fear they and their borrowers may be illiquid three months from now .
The Bank should inject liquidity with a three - month maturity to reduce the liquidity premium and kick - start lending .
Accepting a wider range of eligible collateral â€ “ punitively priced â€ “ would enhance the effectiveness of this .
Garbage , is n’t it ?
Max Hastings , in the Guardian , get ’s a little closer :
it must surely mean a reality check on the follies of recent years , in which tycoons and ticket collectors alike have splurged far more money than they could sensibly afford on buying companies or , at the humbler end of the scale , plasma TV screens so large that newsreaders ’ warts show through their makeup .
But really , what is to blame is that the global financial institutions , and the governments of the industrialised world , have constructed a system wherebye growth is everything , and any attempt to inject a dose of common sense is batted away as not being sensible – or rather , not being “ the way the system works ” .
In 1992 , I made a conscious decision to move my paltry student earned savings into a more ethically conscious bank .
I am still with that bank , not because I agree with the financial system , but that I do n’t have a choice to use any other system .
If I decided to withdraw all my money and place it in a box , that money would , in relation to the rest of the money on Earth , shrink in value .
Within 14 years – assuming world growth of 5 % a year – it would have halved in value ; even though the money would have stayed exactly the same .
That growth , against which I am competing , is based on a combination of investments in spurious ideas and – more importantly – the continued , and accelerating , consumption of natural resources .
Economic value is like energy , it can not be created from nothing , it has to be extracted , usually at tremendous environmental cost .
The governments , financiers and corporations of the world have created this modern Tower of Babel , which is having its foundations progressively undermined by the diminishing availability of the natural resources it feeds off .
No amount of re-engineering or embellishment will allow it to keep getting taller .
Some day one brick too many will be removed and it will all have gone in a virtual puff of smoke .
There is a solution .
But is anyone listening yet ?

On March 23 I spent an hour interviewing Google CEO Eric Schmidt in a cramped conference room 50 feet from his even more cramped office .
( It 's so small that if you spread your arms you can almost touch both walls . )
We talked about everything from Google 's competition with Microsoft and its partnership with Apple to all those data centers it is building .
- Fred Vogelstein
__WIRED : When you joined Google it was just a search engine .
Now it 's redefining the way the world thinks about computing .
Explain . __
ERIC SCHMIDT :
It 's pretty clear that there 's an architectural shift going on .
These occur every 10 or 20 years .
The previous architecture was a proprietary network with PC clients called client - server computing .
With this new architecture you 're always online ; every device can see every application ; and the applications are stored in the cloud .
It means that your servers are professionally managed , so you can actually have a weekend and not spend all your time trying to manage your servers .
It 's like having banks manage your money rather than you managing your money .
And the networks have become secure , and the computers have become fast enough that this is mechanically possible - it actually works .
The other thing that 's interesting is that the new architecture brings in other voices .
The earlier model was pretty proprietary .
The protocols , which were typically Microsoft - based , did n't allow for other ( interface ) choices very well .
Now , with the Internet protocols you can pretty much plug in your own interpretation of how email should work and your own interpretation of how voice over IP should work .
This point about anyone being able to enter the market is a big deal .
Photo sharing , social networks , all of them have this property .
And what 's interesting is that Google , although we 're one of the companies , we 're , by far , not the only company that 's doing this .
Yahoo is an example of a company like this .
eBay is a company like this .
Amazon is a company like this .
And each of the companies I 've named makes money in a different way .
__Right . __
We have talked about this network , or the cloud computing model for years , but we were beholden to the old software selling model - the one where the salesperson is making a million - dollar sale .
I used to be in this business [ when I was at Novell and Sun ] .
That model does n't scale for Internet users .
You just can't get that kind of money out of the average citizen .
So the new model allows you to have free services with advertising .
And this targeted advertising thing is a really , really big deal .
__Is n't it more likely that we 'll have a hybrid model - with some applications in the cloud and others on the desktop ?
__
It depends .
There is not a middle ground when it comes to protocols .
In order for this vision ( of cloud computing ) to work , the protocols have to be open .
They can't be proprietary .
Everyone has to have access to them .
So that 's a clear , binary answer .
With respect to the user experience , which I think is your real question , a hybrid works depending on how it 's architected .
It makes sense , for example , to have graphics computing close to the end user because that 's where your frame buffer is and your computation is .
Games are a good example because it 's very , very hard to imagine games that are network resident only .
They 're so highly interactive .
__Right . __
But it 's perfectly possible to have most of the other computing being done on the server , so that 's an example of a hybrid model .
If it 's something ( like a video or a document or a spreadsheet ) where there 's relatively few changes ( to the file ) , you can put it on a service ( in the cloud ) and then you can cache it locally .
__All these features do n't exist yet , though .
__
True .
Google docs and spreadsheets do n't work if you 're on an airplane .
But it 's a technical problem that is going to get solved .
Eventually you will be able to work on a plane as if you are connected and , then when you get reconnected to the Internet , your computer will just synchronize with the cloud .
Here 's another way of saying this - and these are not my words .
People call this an Internet operating system .
And by " this " I do n't mean Google , I mean the sum of this vision .
And if you think about it as an Internet operating system , the Internet operating system will have to have all of the normal features of the older versions of operating systems .
It will have to have security , it will have to have caching , it will have to have replication , and it will have to have performance .
__Why is it taking so long ?
__
Well , one answer is that the systems they 're replacing are very complicated , and people have very high standards for interactive services .
So everything has to work ; all the features have to be there ; and they have to never break .
We used to think that the enterprise was the hardest customer to satisfy , but we were wrong .
It turns out , consumers are harder than the enterprise because the consumer will not give you a second chance .
And by the way , I would argue that we in the industry forgot this .
We became as a group - certainly I did - consumed with the complexity of the systems that we were building for powerful corporations , and we forgot that there 's a much larger market around consumers for simple solutions .
Online calendars are the perfect example of this .
Sharing a calendar in the older ( client server ) model was hard .
Now it 's easy because the model says the calendars are stored on professional servers , and they are visible everywhere you want them to be .
Making this happen reliably and securely is complicated and technical , but it is ultimately justified by delivering on a very simple concept .
__When you joined Google it was just a search engine .
It has grown into much more .
How should we think about Google today ?
__
One is as an advertising system .
Another one is as this end - user system ( the search , email , and other applications Google delivers to users through an Internet browser ) .
A third way to think of Google is as a giant supercomputer .
And then a fourth way is to think of Google as a social phenomenon involving the company , the people , the brand , the mission , the values - all that kind of stuff .
__How powerful is the supercomputer ?
__
There 's never been anything like it , so we do n't know how to express it .
We build our own data centers , and we do a lot of the work ourselves because the commercial solutions do not have high enough performance .
__What do you mean you do a lot of the work yourself ?
__
Well , essentially , we do all of the software .
So the computers that we 're running start off with Linux as the base , but after that it 's really custom software to move all the data around .
The Web services , all the identity management , all of the database activities , all of the indexing , all the searching , all the ranking , all that kind of stuff in the cloud we do ourselves .
This is a great core competency of the company .
And we have not only data centers , but we have fiber that interconnect those data centers , and connect to the ISPs .
At Google , speed is critical .
And part of the way we get that speed is with that fiber .
__How many data centers are there ?
__
I do n't actually know .
__Are we talking about a half dozen ?
A dozen ?
Or are we talking about dozens ?
__
I think my overall description would be in the dozens .
There are a few very large ones , some of which have been leaked to the press .
But in a year or two the very large ones will be the small ones because the growth rate is such that we keep building even larger ones , and that 's where a lot of the capital spending in the company is going .
__Why do you have to control your own fiber to connect the data centers ?
__
One of the neat things about the bubble is that people built all of this fiber that is now essentially free .
What 's funny about our fiber leasing and purchasing is that people are always assuming that we have some master plan involving telecommunications when , in fact , if you think about it as just solving the supercomputer problem , we just want the thing to be faster .
__Then why are you being so aggressive trying to get muni Wi -Fi projects going around the country ?
__
Because we benefit from broadband .
Remember , one of the critical things in our model is that having inexpensive or , ideally , free access to broadband is a good thing .
Especially if it 's somebody else who 's going to subsidize that using their economics , we think it 's great .
And the more broadband we can get globally , the better .
It 's better for the world ; it 's better for our advertisers ; it 's better for Google .
__So you want to increase broadband penetration in San Francisco , for example , rather than replace the broadband penetration ( from cable and telephone companies ) that already exists ?
__
Yes .
That 's a better way of saying it , thank you .
So if you have 10 percent market share and we can get it to 50 percent , we know that produces a happier citizen .
And we know that those searchers will use our services more .
They 're much more likely to become a calendar user or a G - mail user or a news user , or whatever , because they like the performance .
And , by the way , we 're indifferent as to which broadband it is .
I mean , it could be Wi-Fi , it could be fiber , it could be coax , it can be any of them .
__But you 're not doing last - mile fiber ?
__
No , no , no .
There are plenty of great companies doing that , and we 're perfectly happy to go right on top of all that fiber they 're putting in place .
__You just recently joined the board of Apple and have talked about potential partnerships between Google and Apple .
Explain . __
Google 's architectural model around broadband and services and so forth plays very well to the powerful devices and services Apple is doing .
We 're a perfect back end to the problems that they 're trying to solve .
And they have very good judgment on user interface and people .
They do n't have this supercomputer I 'm talking about , which is the data centers .
What they have is a manufacturing business that 's doing quite well .
And the obvious example is the iPhone , which they announced has in it Google Maps .
__Let 's talk about the fun stuff .
Why do you think Viacom sued you guys ?
__
It 's a business negotiation .
And it 's well established that we 've been negotiating with them , and I 'm sure at some point we 'll negotiate with them some more .
__Their argument is that you 're not working hard enough to keep infringing stuff off .
__
Well , if they would look at the law , they would understand that under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , there 's a shared responsibility .
The law basically says that the copyright owner monitors , and then we expeditiously remove , and we 've done that .
And it's well documented because Viacom told everybody that they gave us 100,000 video take - downs , which we did very , very quickly .
And what was interesting was that our traffic to YouTube has grown very strongly since then .
So one of the arguments that they made was that somehow YouTube was built on stolen content , which is clearly false .
__What 's so hard about finding all the infringing stuff users put up on YouTube ?
Surely , you at Google have the ability to write better content filters .
__
We are working on the appropriate filters , but it 's a hard problem .
You could do audio sampling .
You could do video sampling .
But the audio and video sampling technology is not nearly as good as the technology that allows you to spot infringing text .
But it 's important that we do it because we do n't want to be in the position of having to be given these constant takedown notices .
__News Corp. and NBC Universal just announced they are joining forces to create their own video - distribution channels online .
Does that represent serious competition ?
__
No .
They are taking content that they created and using an exclusive licensing agent to license that content for anybody .
That 's , clearly , a good thing because it means that that content will be available to everybody .
__I got the impression that they were gearing up to compete with you ?
__
No .
In fact , Peter ( Chernin , News Corp. COO ) and I have had a long conversation about this .
We spoke yesterday ( March 22 ) before the announcement , and Peter explicitly said that this was not a competitor to YouTube .
In fact , their site does n't even exist yet .
They 're still designing it .
So , to me , it 's responsive to finding a way to get the content out .
__More broadly , how could copyright law in the digital age be clearer ?
__
The balance that has been struck in the DMCA has worked pretty well , overall .
And I think that it may be better for all of us to work within it for a while as we develop these new businesses .
It 's the unintended consequences of laws that always get you .
You thought there was a good chance of litigation when you bought YouTube .
The deal sets aside a $ 200 million reserve .
Why do the deal if you anticipated so much hassle ?
Because we think it 's fantastic .
I mean , we really do think that the YouTube phenomenon is a sustainable phenomenon for many , many years .
And the argument is very simple : People are using video everywhere .
People are building communities of people who use video .
They 're sharing them .
YouTube 's traffic continues to grow very quickly .
Video is something that we think is going to be embedded everywhere .
And it makes sense , from Google 's perspective , to be the operator of the largest site that contains all that video .
Obviously , we would like it to include licensed , copyrighted content , legally , and make money on it .
But YouTube itself can pay back - and this is where the critics get it wrong - YouTube itself can pay back in simple searches .
Because , remember , when you go to YouTube , you do a search .
When you go to Google , you do a search .
As we get the search integrated between YouTube and Google , which we 're working on , it will drive a lot of traffic into both places .
So the trick , overall , is generating more searches , more uses of Google ...
__Which generates more pageviews , which generates more advertising revenue .
__
You got it .
The other interesting thing about pageviews is that we make our money by improving the quality , not the quantity , of ads showed on a page .
This is very confusing to people .
In a normal media business , you make money by showing more ads .
__What does it take to improve the quality of ads on Google ? __
More computers , basically , and better algorithms .
And more information about you .
The more personal information you 're willing to give us - and you have to choose to give it to us - the more we can target .
The standard example is :
When you say " hot dog , " are you referring to the food , or is your dog hot ?
So the more personalized the information , the better the targeting .
We also have done extensive engineering work with Google Analytics to understand why people click on ads .
That way we can actually look at the purchase and go back and see what buyers did to get there .
That is the holy grail in advertising , because advertisers do n't advertise just to advertise , they actually advertise to sell something .
__How big is the market for all these Google ads ?
__
Today , the vast majority of our revenue is in text ads correlated with searches .
In the last couple of years , we have developed what are called display ad products , including banner ads , video ads , click - to - call ads , and things like that .
And I 've also said that we are pursuing the possibility of television advertising .
By that I mean traditional television advertising .
And we bought dMarc Broadcasting to do radio ads .
So let 's rank the probability of them being affected by targeted ads .
There 's search :
That 's 100 percent affected .
What about radio ?
Is it possible to get a targeted ad right to your car right now ?
Not yet because we can't target the individual receiver in your car .
If two cars are next to each other , the same radio station cannot have two different ads .
However , if it's at a regional level we can do it to the zip code level .
So let 's call that partial targeting .
Now , let 's look at television .
Every one of the next generation of cable set - top boxes is going to get upgraded to an IP - addressable set - top box .
So all of a sudden , that set - top box is a computer that we can talk to .
We can't tell whether it's the daughter or the son or the husband or the wife in a household .
All we know is we 're just talking to the television .
But that 's pretty targetable because family buying patterns are pretty predictable , and you can see what programs they 're watching .
And if you 're watching a YouTube video , we know you 're watching that video .
My point of going through this little treatise is to say , if the total available market is ( $ 600 billion to $ 800 billion , we wo n't be able to target all $ 800 billion .
It will not be a 100 percent perfectly targetable , straight into your brain , but we should be able to offer a material improvement ( in response rates ) to many businesses .
__Do ad agencies want that kind of automation ?
__
Sure they do , because the advertisers do .
You'd be amazed at how sophisticated the ad agencies are now .
__That was n't true a couple of years ago .
__
No , but it 's changed .
This is actually an important piece of data .
When we started talking with them , the ad agencies were not sure what their role was going to be .
And , in some cases , we were at odds with them .
That is all gone as best I can tell .
The ad agencies now see us as a major new revenue stream because all of the advertising models that I 've described require the services of an ad agency .
Somebody still has to produce the targeted ad , somebody still has to figure out what the demographic is .
Somebody still has to figure all that out .
__Do n't you guys do that ?
__
Well , we certainly do n't make the ads , and we 're certainly not the creative people .
All we are is a targeting mechanism .
We 're just a distribution channel .
So we need these ad agencies .
And I 'll tell you - and I spend a lot of time with these global ad agencies - I can tell you that it is very impressive how quickly they have changed .
__Are advertisers going to start actually producing video ads to run on YouTube ? __
Absolutely .
These ad systems tend to produce a lot of video they do n't use .
So for a 30 - second ad , they actually will shoot hours of video .
With that they can do the five - second teaser and the 10 - second teaser and the single - shot still , and the low resolution one and the high resolution one - and they have terminology for each of these and ad formats for each of these .
So the Internet , for them , represents a new creative medium .
So we will see the emergence of new categories of ads and ways of making money .
__When you and I talked a while ago , you talked about Dell and Sony and Intel as being sort of models for how you manage .
Still true ?
__
Very much so .
__Despite the fact that Dell and Sony have had issues .
__
I do n't think that those are management issues .
I think those are just changes in their ecosystem .
__Google 's revenue and employee head count have tripled in the last two years .
How do you keep from becoming too bureaucratic or too chaotic ?
__
It 's a constant problem .
We analyze this every day , and our conclusion is that the best model remains small teams running as fast as they can and tolerating a certain lack of cohesion .
The attempt to provide order drives out the creativity .
And so it 's a balance .
__How do you keep different groups of engineers from unintentionally duplicating one another ’s work and wasting resources ?
__
Well , there is some duplication , but most of it is avoided through communications .
The information systems that are within the company are quite good .
But we 've reined in certain things .
For example , we do n't tolerate the kind of " Hey I want to have my own database and have a good time " behavior that was very effective for us five years ago because the cost of this from a manageability , maintenance , and scaling perspective is a problem .
So virtually all of the product groups are now told , " Build on top of this common set of services .
Now , we internally use exactly the same code running on the same servers - like Gmail and Calendar and Google apps - as our customers do .
__You mean you eat your own dog food ?
__
Yes .
__Google is a global corporation .
What do you do to make employees in other countries all feel like they are working here in Mountain View ? __
It 's a great unsolved problem .
We do videoconferencing ; we do a lot of visits where people are invited to one of the main campuses for a month or two .
So they feel a part of a bigger entity when they go back .
And that model does work .
Of course , we do all the normal meetings - the sales meetings and training meetings , and all that .
More and more of our time is being spent on that .
__What about " 20 percent time " - the time everyone is supposed to allocate in their week to personal projects ?
__
It 's still essential .
Virtually all of the innovation at the company is still coming out of 20 percent time .
__How do you and Larry and Sergey divide your duties ?
__
Pretty much the same as we always have .
Today , I can tell you that Larry and Sergey spent all day in the boardroom doing product reviews .
They haul the engineering teams and product managers into a room , and they go through each product in great detail .
At the same time , I 'm interviewing some ( prospective ) executives , talking to a couple of partners about potential deals , and then in a few minutes the three of us are coming together on stage to answer employee questions .
That 's a very typical day .
Today is Friday - Friday is essentially an all product - review day on their part .
I do the same meeting on Tuesday , which I run and they attend .
I think it 's fair to say that the skill sets ( of the three of us ) are just as complementary as they were five years ago .
They have brilliance and technical understanding , and they 're quicker in some things than I am .
They 're very clear thinkers .
And there is my background of knowing how to scale things ( grow a corporation ) .
I think the combination has worked very well , and it 's not going to change .
We 're going to do this for a long time .
We enjoy what we do .
We like to work with each other .
And we 're all the best of friends .
__Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer called Google a one - trick pony .
Thoughts ?
__
I do n't think it makes sense for me to comment on words and actions by Steve Ballmer .
You can phrase the question in a way that does not involve him , if you want .
__Google gets its revenue from online advertising .
One could make the argument that it is not diversified enough .
Is that something that you think about ?
If so , what are some of the things you are doing about it ?
__
The criticism is correct .
We do get the vast majority of our revenue from advertising , and it's a business that a lot of other people would like to be in .
So the first thing is , let 's understand that we 're in a great business .
Also , there are some emergent models for revenue that are very interesting .
The one that is probably most interesting is Google Apps .
We 're now beginning to get some significant enterprise deals .
Basically , companies are tired of dealing with the complexity of the old model , and our products are now strong enough that they really can reliably serve a corporation .
__Implicit in any kind of conversation about Google Apps is the fact that if it is successful , it will take market share away from Microsoft Office .
Do you agree ?

It may very well be that what you said is true , or it may very well be that consumers will drive us to solve completely new problems .
__Why do you place such a premium on hiring the smartest people and developing and releasing software so quickly ?
__
Fast learners win .
We 're in new , uncharted space .
So the traditional assumptions that you and I might have about the future might actually just be wrong .
There might be a new answer .
And the only way to discover that is to put out your idea and then test it .
And we track the results of that very , very , very rigorously , and this is not something we talk a lot about , but it 's critical for us .
How are these new ideas doing ?
What 's their growth rate ?
What are the issues around them ?
And we push .
What can we do to accelerate the development of this feature ?
What 's the new problem ?
What 's the new opportunity ?
__Google gets criticized a lot in the following way :
It 's a great search engine , but all the other products it has invented and released have n't done well at all .
Thoughts ?

The person who 's saying that does not understand the economic leverage of the company .
We know that Google Earth and Google Maps have had a tremendous impact on Google traffic , users , brand , adoption , and advertisers .
We also know Google News , for example , which we do n't monetize , has had a tremendous impact on searches and on query quality .
We know those people search more .
Because we 've measured it .
Another example is Google Base , which we have been derided about for years .
Google Base is how we get structured data .
The quality of our index is better because of Google Base .
The computers are smarter because of Google Base .
Now , would you say Google Base is a mistake ?
Under the initial formulation , it 's a waste of money because we do n't monetize it .
We could , but what we really do is we use it to improve search .
So one way of thinking about it is it all gets back to search .
If you think about YouTube , YouTube is a " searching the world 's videos " problem , right ?
They all have to be there , but how do you find them ?
What I guess I 'm trying to say is that search is still the killer app .
