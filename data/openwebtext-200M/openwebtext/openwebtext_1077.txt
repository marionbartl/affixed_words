Let ’s talk first about those costs .
A cap - and - trade system would raise the price of anything that , directly or indirectly , leads to the burning of fossil fuels .
Electricity , in particular , would become more expensive , since so much generation takes place in coal - fired plants .
Electric utilities could reduce their need to purchase permits by limiting their emissions of carbon dioxide  and the whole point of cap - and - trade is , of course , to give them an incentive to do just that .
But the steps they would take to limit emissions , such as shifting to other energy sources or capturing and sequestering much of the carbon dioxide they emit , would without question raise their costs .
If emission permits were auctioned off  as they should be  the revenue thus raised could be used to give consumers rebates or reduce other taxes , partially offsetting the higher prices .
But the offset would n’t be complete .
Consumers would end up poorer than they would have been without a climate - change policy .
But how much poorer ?
Not much , say careful researchers , like those at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Even with stringent limits , says the M.I.T. group , Americans would consume only 2 percent less in 2050 than they would have in the absence of emission limits .
That would still leave room for a large rise in the standard of living , shaving only one - twentieth of a percentage point off the average annual growth rate .

To be sure , there are many who insist that the costs would be much higher .
Strange to say , however , such assertions nearly always come from people who claim to believe that free - market economies are wonderfully flexible and innovative , that they can easily transcend any constraints imposed by the world ’s limited resources of crude oil , arable land or fresh water .
TORONTO - Between 30 and 40 per cent of Ontario students in Grades 3 and 6 do not read , write or do math at the provincial standard , according to new test results released Wednesday .
The Education Quality and Accountability Office also found that only 38 per cent of Grade 9 students met or exceeded the provincial standard in applied math , up four per cent from last year .
There were other minor improvements in the standardized test results , with a three per cent increase in the number of Grade 6 students reading at or above the provincial standard to 69 per cent .
Nearly half of the students who were below the provincial standard in Grade 3 reading , writing and math were still below the standard when they reached Grade 6 , the testing agency found .
" These results are a flag to parents and educators , " agency CEO Marguerite Jackson said in a release .
" They show that many students who did not meet the provincial standard in the earlier grades had difficulty catching up as they progressed through their schooling . "
The results also show that more students in grades 3 , 6 , and 9 are meeting or exceeding the provincial standard in reading , writing and math compared to six years ago , said Premier Dalton McGuinty .
" Just to be perfectly clear , in Ontario -- unlike in other places , including other parts of Canada -- the standard is a three , or a B or a 70 per cent , " he said Wednesday .
" It 's not 50 per cent , it 's 70 per cent .
Forty thousand more Ontario students are now achieving that standard in reading , writing and mathematics . "
The scores do n't mean much when the government is making the tests easier for students , said NDP education critic Rosario Marchese .
Students can now use calculators when they take the tests , which are also shorter and contain simpler questions , he said .
" Even though the system might say the marks have improved , the quality is the same , " Marchese said .
" University professors still say that they 're not getting a better product once ( the students ) get into university .
We need to change how we mark students and how we grade them . "
Almost 400,000 Ontario students in Grades 3 , 6 and 9 took the English - language assessments in the 2008 - 09 school year .
Pres. Obama makes his key Middle East speech at Cairo University in Egypt .
In his speech , Obama called for a " new beginning between the United States and Muslims , " declaring that " this cycle of suspicion and discord must end . "

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
In reaching out to the world 's one and a half billion Muslims with today 's historic speech , it 's unclear if President Obama is also pushing away America 's long - time ally Israel .
Speaking in Cairo - the president recognized the U.S. 's unbreakable bond with the Jewish state and the horror of the Holocaust , but also talked about the suffering of the Palestinian people .
He described their situation as intolerable and stressed the need for a two - state solution .
President Obama called on Palestinians to abandon violence - pointing to America 's own civil rights history and saying it was a " peaceful and determined insistence " that brought about equal rights .
And , he once again called on Israel to stop building settlements ; and to allow Palestinians to live and work and develop their society .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already rejected President Obama 's call for a settlement freeze .
But experts suggest that this demand from Mr. Obama will make Arab leaders listen .
They say although the U.S. has been opposed to Israeli settlements for decades , past American presidents have allowed Israel to keep building them .
And some believe that if " no " really means " no " this time around , it may be easier to form a regional coalition against Iran .
Speaking of Iran - Mr. Obama repeated his belief today that the Islamic Republic has the right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes - another statement that is probably not sitting too well with the Israelis .
Finally , for the first time in a long time , a visit to the Middle East by a sitting U.S. president did not include a stop in Israel .
Here ’s my question to you :
Is Pres . Obama reaching out to Muslims at the expense of America 's relationship with Israel ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Scott writes :
If President Obama did anger Israel , so what ?
Where are they going to turn ?
We can support the nation of Israel without rubber stamping everything they do .
Their treatment of Palestinians enrages the Arab world .
We cannot advocate the rights of only some .
I agree with our president that Israel must improve its treatment of Palestinians , and I 'm glad the pressure of the U.S. is being brought to bear on this human rights issue .
Susan from Medford , Oregon writes :
The president is not pushing the Israelis away .
He is demanding that they stop illegal settlements in the land that will become Palestine .
If the Israelis are ever to get peace , they must give up the West Bank , and they know it .
They too are stuck with a very vocal group of right - wing nut cases who would rather tear down the country than engage in honest negotiations .
Kelly writes :
To some extent , yes .
The reaching - out will be at the expense of Israel , but for far too long this country has acted like Israel was the pillar around which everything Middle East had to be built .
Israel has taken that position and our unwavering support for granted and gone too far in many instances over the past several years .
Balance needs to be restored and Israel 's standing needs to come down a couple of pegs to have any chance of bringing balance and peace to the region .
Mark from Berwyn , Pennsylvania writes :
He 'll reach out to Muslims today , but when his re-election nears , he will certainly reach out to Israel .
He 'll need the Jewish vote .
He is your run -of - the - mill politician : he says whatever will get him votes , from whoever is voting .
It 's the same sad , sorry tune we always hear from our political " leaders " .
He 's nothing special .
Joe writes :
Jack ,
What expense ?
America has relationships with many countries : some good , some bad .
Enough kissing up to Israel already .
Move on , please !
Muslims are here to stay , let ’s work with them .
Jill writes :
The U.S. has been reaching out to Israel at the expense of US / Muslim relations since 1967 .
It 's time to reverse the trend .
FAIRFAX , Va. , Aug. 3 ( UPI ) -- A Virginia man says he is fighting a jaywalking ticket he was issued while helping a family of Canada geese cross a busy street .
Jozsef Vamosi , 60 , of Fairfax said he was given the ticket June 18 at about 9:30 a.m. when he pulled over on the Fairfax County Parkway to protect the geese attempting to cross the busy road , The Washington Post reported Monday .

Vamosi said the geese had just finished their trek across the street when a police officer arrived .
" He jumped out the car , yelling at me , " Vamosi said of officer Kevin Rusin .
He said he plans to go to General District Court to fight the jaywalking citation Rusin gave him .
" And if I had the chance , I 'd do it again , " Vamosi said of helping the geese .
" That 's the way I 'm raised . "
A drug originating on Easter Island , the mysterious South Pacific home of a lost statue - building people , may become the first substance to slow down human ageing , new research indicates .
Rapamycin , a pharmacological product used to prevent rejection in organ transplants , has been found to extend the lifespan of mice by up to 38 per cent , raising the possibility that it may delay ageing in people .
Hitherto a matter for science fiction , the idea of an anti-ageing drug which would allow people to prolong their natural lifespan and also to avoid age - related diseases is now being seriously considered for the first time as a result of the findings by American researchers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Rapamycin is a bacterial product originally found in a soil sample from Easter Island , the Polynesian extinct volcano famous for its monumental statues erected hundreds of years ago by the island people , and known in the region as Rapa Nui – hence the drug 's name .
Originally developed as an anti-fungal agent , rapamycin was soon found to have powerful immuno - suppressant properties and thus be valuable for preventing rejection of transplanted organs .
It was also found to delay the ageing process when used experimentally with three sets of lower organisms : yeast , nematode worms and fruit flies .
Now , however , it has been shown to affect the ageing of mice – the first time that this has ever been shown with a mammal .
A team of 14 researchers from three institutions , led by David Harrison from the Jackson Laboratory at Bar Harbor in Maine , fed rapamycin to mice late in their life – at 600 days of age – and showed that both the median and maximal lifespan of treated animals were considerably extended .
Currently , the only way to extend the life of a rodent is by severely restricting its diet , so this marks the first report of a pharmacological intervention that lengthens the life of mammals – with clear implications for humans .
The results , published today in an online paper on the website of the journal Nature , are attracting considerable excitement , and an accompanying article in Nature by two of the world 's leading experts on the ageing process , Matt Kaeberlein and Brian K Kennedy from the University of Washington , Seattle , headed " A Midlife Longevity Drug ? " openly asks the question : " Is this the first step towards an anti-ageing drug for people ? "
Their answer is that it may well be .
Dr Kaeberlein and Dr Kennedy first issued a warning to people not to start taking rapamycin at once in the hope of prolonging their lives – " the potential immuno - suppressive effects of this compound alone are sufficient to caution against this , " they advised .
But they added : " On the basis of animal models , however , it is interesting to consider that rapamycin ... might prove useful in combating many age - associated disorders .
Also ... it may be possible to develop pharmacological strategies that provide the health and longevity benefits without unwanted side - effects .
" So , although extending human lifespan with a pill remains the purview of science fiction writers for now , the results of Harrison et al provide a reason for optimism that even during middle age , there 's still time to change the road you 're on . "
Rapamycin was known to have an influence on ageing in the lower organisms by disrupting the influence of an enzyme known as TOR , which regulates cell growth .
Dr Harrison and colleagues found that this was also the case with mice , and found that rapamycin feeding could extend mouse lifespan even when started late in life .
The maximum lifespan went up from 1,094 days to 1,245 days for female mice , and from 1,078 to 1,179 for male mice – a striking increase of life expectancy of 38 per cent for females and 28 per cent for males .
Dr Harrison and his colleagues conclude : " An effective anti-ageing intervention that could be initiated later than the midpoint of the lifespan could prove to be especially relevant to clinical situations , in which the efficacy of anti-ageing interventions would be particularly difficult to test in younger volunteers .
Our data justify special attention to the role of the TOR pathway in control of ageing in mammals and in the pathogenesis of late - life illnesses . "
Also known as sirolimus , rapamycin was first discovered as a product of the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus , which was found in an Easter Island soil sample .
Probably the world 's most remote and least - visited inhabited island , Easter Island is globally famous for its haunting monumental stone statues of human faces , set up around the coast , known as Moai .
Weighing as much as 80 tonnes , they were carved by a lost people , whose society may have collapsed , according to the American environmental geographer Jared Diamond , when they overexploited their forests .
Volcanic , hilly and now treeless , and a territory of Chile , the island is situated 2,180 miles west of Chile itself and 1,290 miles east of Pitcairn Island ; its European name comes from its discovery on Easter Sunday 1722 , by the Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen .
Its oldest known Polynesian name is thought to be Te Pito O Te Henua , meaning " the navel of the world " .
Rapa Nui is a name given to it by Tahitian sailors in the 19th century .
Police have seized more than $ 1 million in cannabis and assets - including an allegedly stolen pig - during raids south of Melbourne .
Investigators seized 75 kilograms of cannabis with a street value of $ 450,000 and more than $ 550,000 in assets , including the pig and a stolen excavator , along with a small amount of steroids .
Seven men aged from 33 to 71 and two women , a 19 - year - old and 31 - year - old , were all arrested and charged with drug - related offences .
They all came from the Mornington Peninsula and were bailed to appear in court , except for a 42 - year - old man from Drouin , south - east of Melbourne , who was remanded in custody .
The drug task force and Mornington tasking unit conducted the operation to crack down on cannabis cultivation and amphetamine trafficking in the Mornington Peninsula area , a police spokesman said .

Carmaker Nissan has pledged to invest more than £ 200 m in a new rechargeable battery factory in Sunderland boosting the north - east of England 's drive to become a leading centre for green technology .
The region hopes to swap a legacy of shipbuilding , steam engines and coalmining for a pioneering role in the manufacture of electric cars and lorries .
Nissan 's announcement of plans for a rechargeable lithium - ion battery plant was accompanied by Gordon Brown 's confirmation that the government is making the north - east the UK's Low Carbon Economic Area specialising in " ultra - low carbon vehicles . "
Against a backdrop of job losses and unrelenting uncertainty for workers at UK car factories , the prime minister hailed Nissan 's new battery plant as a step towards economic recovery .
He sought to raise hopes the Japanese company could choose its north - east base for a new European green car operation over a rival facility in Spain .
" Nissan 's investment in a new battery plant and its hope to start producing electric vehicles here in Sunderland is great news for the local economy , creating up to 350 direct jobs and creating and safeguarding hundreds more in the associated supply chain , " said Brown .
" Sunderland could now be a strong contender to produce electric vehicles for Nissan in Europe , and we will continue to work with Nissan to ensure this happens . "
Visiting Nissan 's Sunderland plant , Business Secretary Peter Mandelson said the north - east was already a specialised region for green cars .
The region 's designation as a Low Carbon Economic Area will mean establishing a training centre to teach the manufacture and repair of green cars , creating a research and development hub which collates work from five universities on using low carbon cars and opening a test track to try out new vehicles .
The north - east is the second such " economic area " to be created by the government after the South West of England - a centre of marine and tidal energy schemes .
Mandelson hopes the north - east green cars project will attract foreign investment and secure the UK 's place as " a global leader in high - tech manufacturing and automotive industries . "
Local government officials hailed the Low Carbon initiative as potentially creating 10,000 jobs over five years – a huge morale boost to an area hit by the rapid decline of its manufacturing industry and wider economic turmoil .
Margaret Fay , chairman of the One North East regional development agency drew parallels with the north - east 's industrial heyday .
" The first steam engines came from the north - east , we are good at firsts .
We were the centre of excellence all those years ago with Stephenson and the Rocket .
It 's like history repeating itself for the next generation . "
" We see this as the next iteration of the north - east economy .
We have been through the very heavy industries of shipbuilding , steel , coalmining etc ...
Clearly manufacturing is at the heart of what we have always done in the region and this takes us back into what really are our core competencies .
But this is manufacturing for the future . "
The agency has aspirations to turn the north - east into Britain 's green car training centre as demand rises for mechanics able to fix a new breed of electric vehicles .
" The training centre will go right from basic training , through apprenticeships , right up to masters and PhD's , " said Fay .
The planned research and development centre will look into aspects of electric cars such as how far they can travel between charges .
AA president Edmund King says his group will feed its research into both the training and research centres .
" It was important to get a motoring organisation involved because electric vehicles will only be successful if consumers use them , understand them and trust them , " said King .
He quotes AA research suggesting almost two - thirds of drivers would consider buying a more fuel efficient car .
Drivers in the North East and Northern Ireland were most likely to consider buying a green car .
But others are more sceptical that electric cars are worthy of such " green " government investment .
Stephen Glaister director of the RAC Foundation points out the power to charge batteries will most likely be generated from coal or gas .
" I think it is entirely unclear whether electric cars have anything to offer . "
" This may be about being seen to do something , it may be about creating new jobs , but I imagine it 's very risky in terms of the particular technology they are going into .
There 's a long history of governments supporting different bits of the motor industry and having them fail . "
North - eastern company Smith Electric Vehicles , the world 's largest manufacturer of electric commercial vehicles , has questions about the government 's green car plans for other reasons .
Managing director Geoff Allison was puzzled as to why the government was not looking at manufacturers ' more urgent needs .
" Here today , now , we need investment .
We have got electric vehicles , we need volume orders , we need subsidies .
We need incentive from the government to help us get commercial vehicles on the road quicker .
" In Europe they are all way ahead of us in terms of acceptability of electric vehicles . "
If we are n't given support , the French will overtake us .
You wo n't be buying a British built electric vehicle , you 'll be buying a French one , " he says
Moderate Liberal Sen. McCaskill called auditing the Federal Reserve “ wacky ” during one of her recent “ kitchen table ” talks in St. Joseph .
One would think that a former state auditor would have the people ’s best interests at heart and listen to them !
So much for the ongoing secrecy of the nation ’s independent central banking system .
A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 75 % of Americans favor auditing the Federal Reserve and making the results available to the public .
Support for the bill has grown now that the Obama administration is proposing to give the Fed greater economic regulatory powers .
The Fed which sets U.S. monetary policy was created as an independent agency to keep it free of politically - motivated interference .

In a rare move , the province 's Special Investigations Unit has charged a Toronto officer with assault causing bodily harm and dangerous driving in connection with a car chase earlier this year .
Const .
Ricardo Gomez , who has worked mainly out of 12 Division since joining the force eight years ago , was serving a stint with the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy , TAVIS , earlier this year .
On March 4 , at 9:40 p.m. , he became involved in a pursuit along Danforth Ave .
The vehicle Gomez was trailing was involved in a collision and a Toronto man was injured , said SIU spokesperson Jasbir Brar .
Lawyer David Butt , representing Gomez , said the reason his client was pursuing the car will come out in court .
" We respect the importance of ( the SIU 's ) mandate completely and we are confident that a full review of this situation will show that PC Gomez engaged in no wrongdoing whatsoever , " said Butt .
The SIU is a civilian agency responsible for investigating all cases of death , serious injury or sexual assault involving police .
According to its 2007 - 08 annual report , during the SIU 's last statistical year , the agency investigated 246 occurrences , laying charges against 10 officers in connection with seven incidents .
The last time the SIU charged an officer was in June .
An Ottawa officer , Const .
Shyldon Safruk , was charged with assault causing bodily harm for allegedly assaulting a cab driver .
The agency has been the subject of three government - ordered reviews , the most recent released last year .
In September , the Ontario Ombudsman 's office released a review in which the SIU was accused of " police bias " by Ombudsman André Marin , a former SIU director .
Staff Sgt. Gary Mulholland , who works with Gomez at 12 Division , refused to comment on the rarity of SIU charges , but said Gomez was a skilled officer .
" I guess he's one of the better young officers I had on the shift , " said Mulholland .
Gomez was investigated by internal officers in connection to a 2005 incident where he fired his gun .
He was cleared .
He will appear in court on Sept. 14 .

Iceland to cut public spending by 30 % over next 3 years ; Slams UK and Netherlands By Finfacts Team Aug 14 , 2009 - 2:34:37 AM
President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson chairs the first meeting of Iceland 's new Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir's Cabinet , on February 01 , 2009 - - Sigurðardóttir is the longest serving member of Iceland 's Parliament , the Althingi .
She is the first openly gay head of goverment and her spouse , Jónína Leósdóttir , is an author and playwright .
Iceland 's prime minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir , says in an article published in the Financial Times today that her government plans a 30 per cent cut in public spending over the next 3 years , with extensive contractions in infrastructure spending and wages .
She terms it " a heavy burden for our population of 300,000 . "
In the article , she also slams the UK and the Netherlands for demanding compensation for payments on deposits in respect of a failed Icelandic online bank .
Sigurðardóttir said Icelanders are angry at having to take on burden of compensation for the Icesave savings accounts of Landsbanki - - a failed , privately owned , commercial bank , which attracted hundreds of thousands of UK and Dutch savers with high interest rates .
The amount to be shouldered by Iceland is huge - - about 50 per cent of Iceland 's gross domestic product .
She said assets against this debt will substantially lower the net amount , but there is much uncertainty about the valuations and forecasts underpinning such calculations .
Icesave was an online bank of Iceland 's second biggest financial institution , Landsbanki , which was nationalised by the government last October .
“ The Icelandic government have told me , believe it or not , they have no intention of honouring their obligations there , ” Alistair Darling , the Chancellor , told BBC radio .
But citing “ exceptional circumstances ” he said : “ We have decided we will stand behind those savers . "
More than 300,000 British customers had around £ 4 billion deposited in Icesave accounts , which until its closure , offered higher rates of interest than British banks
UK prime minister Gordon Brown , had used the Anti-Terrorism , Crime and Security Act 2001 , to put restrictions on Landsbanki , a move that was criticised by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee .
Prime Minister Sigurðardóttir says in today 's FT article : " The FT has reported how the Dutch opposed the IMF lending to Iceland in order to enforce their demands on Icesave , claiming the UK and Germany as allies .
The perception is that Treasury officials in the UK and the Netherlands used their bargaining power against a much weaker party when the Icesave deal , now being debated in the Icelandic parliament , was struck . "
She concludes : " It is to be hoped that the people of large countries such as the UK and the Netherlands are aware of the lasting impact their governments can have on small countries such as ours at a time of great distress . "
Interest rate
Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir
Iceland 's central bank on Thursday warned that a likely delay in funding from the International Monetary Fund could be very damaging for the country 's economic recovery as it announced it was holding official interest rates at 12 per cent .
Sedlabanki raised its outlook for the economy and now sees a 9.1 per cent contraction this year compared with a previous forecast for an 11 per cent decline .
Household spending will slump 19.7 per cent and fixed investment will plunge 48.4 per cent , according to the bank .
Inflation slowed to an annual 11.3 per cent in July , from 12.2 per cent in June , the statistics office said at the end of last month .
Sedlabanki has lowered its benchmark rate four times this year from a record 18 per cent since obtaining a $ 5.1 billion loan from a group led by the International Monetary Fund .
Sedlabanki Interim Governor Svein Harald
Oygard said that 19 of the 20 requirements made by the IMF for its loan payments had been met , and the future for the country over the next few months depended on the remaining one .
" If things are brought to a halt , I think the impact of that on the Icelandic economy will be very unfortunate , " he said at a press conference .
The IMF announced last month that it had put back a review of the loan program , which had been scheduled for August 3rd .
An approval of the review would free up a second tranche of a $ 2.1 billion IMF loan deal .
The funds are part of a $ 10 billion aid package agreed by the IMF and Iceland 's Nordic neighbors and other European countries .
Sedlabanki said Thursday that the hold on the loans , was related to delays in the Icelandic parliament approving a Bill , which would ensure the UK and the Netherlands are repaid for the billions they spent in compensating Icesave account holders .
More visitors
Foreign visitors to Iceland increased by 1.2 per cent in July this year compared to July 2008 , according to data issued on Thursday by the Icelandic Tourist Board .
Around 82,000 foreign travelers departed from Keflavík International Airport last month - - up by 950 in July 2008 .
Since January 1 , 2009 , a total of 261,000 foreign travelers have left from Keflavík Airport - - a 1.7 per cent decrease from the same period last year .
Almost 50 per cent fewer Icelandic travelers passed through the airport during the first seven months of this year compared to January - July 2008 .
Buzz Aldrin has thrown his weight behind those who believe that the Ares component of NASA 's Constellation programme is on a hike to nowhere .
The NASA veteran has insisted the US needs to reprieve the space shuttle for extended operations until 2015 , pending development of viable lifting technologies which might ultimately carry mankind to Mars .
Writing in Popular Mechanics , Aldrin 's bold plan for the future of space exploration calls for Constellation 's Orion capsule to ride a Delta IV or Atlas V , while private space ventures such as SpaceX ’s Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule should handle low - Earth orbit tasks .
SpaceX 's commercial Falcon venture should , he stresses , be backed by a reprieved shuttle which can until 2015 reduce " unacceptable " US reliance on Russian Soyuz tech to supply the International Space Station .
Aldrin also says any attempted return to the Moon should be an international effort , in which China , Europe , India , Japan and Russia should do the " lion ’s share of the planning , technical development and funding " .
He notes : " By renouncing our goal of being first on the Moon ( again ) , we would call off Space Race II with the Chinese and encourage them to channel their ambitious lunar efforts into the consortium . "
The veteran astronaut insists : " The agency ’s current Vision for Space Exploration will waste decades and hundreds of billions of dollars trying to reach the moon by 2020 - a glorified rehash of what we did 40 years ago .
Instead of a steppingstone to Mars , NASA ’s current lunar plan is a detour . "
Regarding the Red Planet , Aldrin provocatively suggests NASA should set its sights on " comets , asteroids and Mars ’s moon Phobos as intermediate destinations " for an " entirely new spacecraft that I call the Exploration Module , or XM " .
The XM , he elaborates , could be " based on NASA ’s canceled space station Habitation Module " and ready for testing as early as 2014 .
By 2025 , the XM could be fit to touch down on Martian moon Phobos , described as " the perfect perch from which to monitor and control the robots that will build the infrastructure on the Martian surface , in preparation for the first human visitors " .
Aldrin concludes : " But for this dream to happen , NASA needs to dramatically change its ways .
Its myopic Vision for Space Exploration will never get us to Mars .
Progressive innovation and enlightened international cooperation will .
President Obama and Congress need to set NASA right - and soon . "
" It will derail our Mars effort , siphoning off money and engineering talent for the next two decades .
If we aspire to a long - term human presence on Mars - and I believe that should be our overarching goal for the foreseeable future - we must drastically change our focus . "
Aldrin 's entertaining broadside will certainly find favour with SpaceX's Elon Musk , who recently told the Obama - appointed human spaceflight review committee his company should be chosen to do " domestic " lifting .
It furthermore endorses the opinion of space shuttle programme manager John Shannon who insisted the level of funding for Constellation " basically took away the lunar programme " .
Shannon is backing a " Heavy Lift Vehicle " , based on existing space - shuttle lifting technology which could project a crew capsule to orbit or , suitably modified , carry a lander to the Moon .
That Ares will never fulfil NASA 's lofty ambitions for the technology is a view shared by Stephen Metschan , proponent of the DIRECT plan's " Jupiter " vehicle - another giant fuel tank backed by solid booster proposal , which could also reach the Moon .
Whatever the human spaceflight review committee eventually decides , it 's likely to restrict itself to the modest short - term aims of keeping the ISS victualled and just how to get the US of A back to the lunar surface .
Sadly , a manned jaunt to Phobos from where astronauts can view robotic Buzz Aldrins terraforming Mars for permanent human occupation are likely beyond even America 's current capabilties and wallet . ®

SELF CONTROL is one of our most cherished values .
We applaud those who have the discipline to regulate their appetites and actions , and we try hard to instill this virtue in our children .
Think of the marketing slogans that key off the desire for restraint : “ Just say no . ” “ Just do it . ”
We celebrate the power of the mind to make hard choices , despite our emotions or other temptations , and keep us on course .
But what if we ca n’t just do it ?
What if “ it ” is too difficult or if our strategy for success is misguided ?
Is it possible that willpower actually might be an obstacle rather than a means to happiness and harmony ?
Can we have too much of a good thing ?
Two Tufts University psychologists believe there may be some truth to this possibility .
Evan P. Apfelbaum and Samuel R. Sommers were intrigued by the notion that too much self - control may indeed have a downside — and that relinquishing some personal power might be paradoxically tonic , both for individuals and for society .
They decided to test this idea in the laboratory .
Your Inner Bigot
They explored the virtue of powerlessness in the arena of race relations .
They figured that well - intentioned people are careful — sometimes hypercareful — not to say the wrong thing about race in a mixed - race group .
Furthermore , they thought that such effortful self - control might actually cause both unease and dishonesty , which could in turn be misconstrued as racial prejudice .
To test this theory , they first deliberately sapped the mental powers of a number of volunteers .
This practice is not as diabolical as it sounds .
Researchers ran the participants through a series of computer - based mental exercises that are so challenging that the subjects temporarily deplete their cognitive reserves needed for discipline .
Once they had the volunteers in this compromised state of mind , they put the group ( and others who were not so depleted ) into a social situation with the potential for racial tension .
Here it is :
Each white subject is left alone in a room .
A black man enters and asks if the volunteer will consent to a brief interview on the issue of how universities should guarantee racial diversity .
This question is ostensibly unrelated to the self - control experiment , but in fact that is a ruse .
The interviewer asks the participant to share any thoughts he or she might have on this “ hot topic , ” and the conversation is recorded .
It was that simple , although sometimes the interviewers were white , to serve as controls .
Afterward , the volunteers rated the interaction for comfort , awkwardness and enjoyment .
In addition , independent judges — both black and white — analyzed the five - minute interactions , commenting on how cautious the volunteers were , how direct in their answers , and how racially prejudiced .
Failure of Control
The results were provocative .
As reported in the February issue of the journal Psychological Science , those who were mentally depleted — that is , those who did not have the energy to exert personal discipline and self - control — found talking about race with a black man much more enjoyable than did those whose self - control was intact .
That outcome is presumably because they were not working so hard at monitoring and curbing what they said .
It may seem counterintuitive , but being cognitively drained made them less inhibited and more candid , which felt good .
And it was n’t just the volunteers ’ perceptions of the experience : the independent black observers found that the powerless volunteers were much more direct and authentic in conversation .
And perhaps most striking , blacks saw the less inhibited whites as less prejudiced against blacks .
In other words , relinquishing power over oneself appears to thwart overthinking and “ liberate ” people for more authentic relationships .
Race relations is just one arena of life where a little powerlessness may go a long way .
Addiction recovery is another .
One of the guiding principles of 12 - step programs is that too much self - reliance can be harmful and that powerlessness is a necessary precursor of the emotional balance needed for sobriety .
But self - reliance is so deeply ingrained in us that it pervades our work lives , our relationships and our health choices , so it is a real challenge to accept that it might sometimes be a character flaw .
It is good to remember that the volunteers here were not only perceived as fairer ; they themselves felt happier .
Where else might we be acting too smart for our own good ?

This uptick in the radical right predates the health care debate that is supposedly inspiring all the gun waving .
Nor can this movement be attributed to a stepped - up attack by Democrats on this crowd ’s holy Second Amendment .
Since taking office , Obama has disappointed gun-control advocates by relegating his campaign pledge to reinstate the ban on assault weapons to the down - low .
No , the biggest contributor to this resurgence of radicalism remains panic in some precincts about a new era of cultural and demographic change .
As the sociologist Daniel Bell put it , “ What the right as a whole fears is the erosion of its own social position , the collapse of its power , the increasing incomprehensibility of a world  now overwhelmingly technical and complex  that has changed so drastically within a lifetime . ”
Bell ’s analysis appeared in his essay “ The Dispossessed , ” published in 1962 , between John Kennedy ’s election and assassination .
J.F.K. , no more a leftist than Obama , was the first Roman Catholic in the White House and the tribune of a new liberal order .
Bell could have also written his diagnosis in 1992 , between Bill Clinton ’s election and the Oklahoma City bombing .
Clinton , like Kennedy and Obama , brought liberals back into power after a conservative reign and represented a generational turnover that stoked the fears of the dispossessed .
While Bell ’s essay remains relevant in 2009 , he could not have imagined in 1962 that major politicians , from a vice - presidential candidate down , would either enable or endorse a radical and armed fringe .
Nor could he have imagined that so many conservative intellectuals would remain silent .
William F. Buckley did make an effort to distance National Review from the John Birch Society .
The only major conservative writer to repeatedly and forthrightly take on the radical right this year is David Frum .
He ended a recent column for The Week , titled “ The Reckless Right Courts Violence , ” with a plea that the president “ be met and bested on the field of reason , ” not with guns .

Those on the right who defend the reckless radicals inevitably argue “ The left does it too ! ”
It ’s certainly true that both the left and the right traffic in bogus , Holocaust - trivializing Hitler analogies , and , yes , the protesters of the antiwar group Code Pink have disrupted Congressional hearings .
But this is a false equivalence .
Code Pink does n’t show up on Capitol Hill with firearms .
And , as the 1960s historian Rick Perlstein pointed out on the Washington Post Web site last week , not a single Democratic politician endorsed the Weathermen in the Vietnam era .
This week the journalist Ronald Kessler ’s new behind - the - scenes account of presidential security , “ In the President ’s Secret Service , ” rose to No. 3 on The Times nonfiction best - seller list .
No wonder there ’s a lot of interest in the subject .
We have no reason to believe that these hugely dedicated agents will fail us this time , even as threats against Obama , according to Kessler , are up 400 percent from those against his White House predecessor .

Its rugged northern coastline is a favourite summer destination for Britons .
But holidaymakers have been warned away from certain beaches in northern Brittany that have been swamped by tonnes of potentially lethal rotting green algae .
Hundreds of local residents and environmentalists demonstrated on the otherwise picturesque beach of St - Michel - en - Grève at the weekend as the " green menace " manifested itself in record piles of noxious seaweed swamping the shore .
A man has also taken legal action after he was left seriously ill from breathing in fumes from the decomposing algae .
Vincent Petit , a 27 - year - old vet , had to be dragged unconscious from a patch of rotting algae a metre deep this month after the horse he was riding collapsed and died from fumes given off by the sludge on the beach .
The horse died within minutes .
Last year , two dogs died while walking near piles of algae on a beach close by .
Local mayors said more than 70 beaches had been hit by the seaweed that has plagued the coastline for more than a decade , but which this year reached unprecedented levels .
Some town halls in Brittany are spending more than € 100,000 ( £ 86,000 ) a year on bulldozing the seaweed away , but levels are still rising .
The seaweed is harmless when it is alive , but as it decomposes on the beach – often releasing a foul stench of rotten eggs – the gases can be toxic .
On the Côtes d'Armor coast , certain patches of shore have been closed and warnings have been issued to the public .
Environmentalists blame pollution from intensive farming .
Brittany has a high concentration of pig , cattle and poultry farming and campaigners say nitrates from the farms are polluting the water system and feeding the prolific algae , which are then washed in to shore .
André Ollivro , vice - president of the campaign group Halte aux Marées Vertes ( Stop the Green Slick ) , said : " Places where I used to sail , where my children used to build sandcastles on the Bay de Saint - Brieuc have disappeared under green algae and sediment .
The solution is to stop pollution from intensive farming .
It literally stinks inland because of places like pig farms – and now it stinks by the sea . "
Local authorities said they had made efforts to minimise the level of agriculture in the area and to reduce quantities of farming refuse released into the sea .
The Centre for Study and Evaluation of Algae in Brittany said the problem was not " systematic " and tourists should not stay away from the whole region .
Potentially toxic algae has posed problems elsewhere in the past , including in Wales , where warning signs were put up this summer at a Snowdonia lake , near Llanberis in Gwynedd , warning lake users not to swim in the water or let animals drink it .
The warning was later lifted after the council said tests showed that the algae blooms had subsided and that the lake was safe to use .
The algae responsible for the problems in Wales , Anabaena spirioides , has a 50 % chance of being toxic .
In New Zealand , an unidentified toxic algae was blamed this week for causing the deaths of two dogs on beaches in Auckland .
Scientists who tested samples said the deaths were caused by a naturally occurring neurotoxin .
There are some reasons why anyone will prefer visiting the casinos in Malaysia than with most other places .
Malaysian casinos have several advantages over most casinos available other places in the world .
These advantages make them popular in so many ways over the rest of casinos in other places .
Below is an outline of the reasons why the next time you are out gambling you should think about hitting the Malaysia casino .
Different Games
In Malaysia , you will get to enjoy some games from blackjacks , betting to poker among others .
With so many games to choose from , it is hard to get bored playing .
If one game does not appeal to you , you can move on to the next one and get to enjoy .
Having a pool of games form which to choose from will always make the gambling interesting .
It will also attract different kinds of people .
Having different people to play against will in a great way increase the chances that you have of making a good return .
Great Payouts
Another thing that makes most people prefer playing in Malaysian casinos is because of the great payouts that are offered .
From the games that are available , it is quite easy t even double your initial investment in just a few minutes of playing .
You will get to enjoy great payouts that in most cases , you will win than lose .
Having this in mind will always make gambling somewhat appealing .
All that one needs to do is to exercise caution while playing .
Security
Malaysian casinos are some of the most secure casinos in the world .
For a gambler , security is crucial since they deal with money .
One needs to be sure that the money they win will be in safe hands .
A casino that ensures that the player is protected will always be a preferred option by the players .
Some of the casinos even go to extra lengths of providing escort for their players so that they do not get robbed .
Privacy
A casino player will always value their privacy .
Malaysian casino knows and understands this .
Great measures are usually taken to ensure that people who request to remain anonymous remain so .
Some people come from high - end families or are powerful people in the country .
They might be people who would n’t want their identities revealed .
When this is the case , they would want to still enjoy their game without constantly worrying who might see them .
Malaysian casinos will do all that is possible to ensure that the identity of such people is protected .
From the above , it is evident that Malaysian casinos are some of the best in the world .
There is so much that they have put in to ensure that their clients have a wonderful experience at all times .
Most people will always come back to a place where they feel valued and taken care of .
This is exactly what casinos in Malaysia usually offer .
Therefore , the next time you are thinking of some gambling expedition , you may want to try Malaysia . …

So you 're on the road and you need to score some -- of the medical variety , of course .
You can now just pull out your iPhone , head to the iTunes Store , download a $ 2.99 app called Cannabis , and you 're on your way .
If you are not in the dozen or so states where medical marijuana is legal this app will likely prove less than useful .
But if you are , this is the way the app works , according to Chris Brandrick of PC World :
' Cannabis ' currently works via location - based services , pulling in a users current location and using that knowledge to display relevant information , such as where the closest legal source of Cannabis can be found .
For example it will show users of the application legal dispensaries in over a dozen US States , and for those states lacking medical marijuana laws , the app will point you in the direction of a nearby Cannabis organization .
For International users a display of local legal Cannabis coffee shops will be offered .
In addition to sharing where users can find Cannabis , users can also locate local doctors , clinics , attorneys and more .
The program was launched by Activists Justifying the Natural Agriculture of Ganja ( AJNAG -- or ganja spelled backwards ) , a Web - based marijuana advocacy group represents the latest in a string of iPhone apps sure to raise eyebrows .
Apple , which encourages outside developers to submit their projects for sale , has triggered controversy with a variety of apps , including its '' Baby Shaker ' ' game in which players violently shake the image of a baby , and " Hottest Girls , " which featured partially clad and completely nude models .
Apple has reportedly pulled both apps .
Developers have been racing to create apps , lured by get - rich - quick tales of inventors who came up with popular iPhone games and utilities , according to The New York Times .
As someone recently said , what planet do they live on ?
Chuck Grassley and Ken Conrad fall all over themselves praising their co-op proposal , while Howard Dean , the Last Semi-Honest Man , calls it out as the political theater it is .
I do n't know about you , but I 'm pretty tired of these expedient political solutions to real - life problems .
After reading Matt Taibbi's latest Rolling Stone piece on health care reform ( no link yet ) , I now understand just how thoroughly the Blue Dogs screwed us on the public option and I would cry no tears if it disappeared in its present form :
( CBS ) Former Vermont Governor and doctor , Howard Dean said the health care co-operative proposal is purely for political strategy and has not worked in the past on " Face the Nation " Sunday .
" That proposal is a political compromise , not a policy compromise , " Dean said .
" No one knows what it would look like and when it has been tried in the past it mostly has n’t worked . "
Dean , a strong advocate for the public insurance option , said people need the choice of a government - run plan to compete with private insurers .
He argued that because private insurance companies are investor - owned , they are spending less money on health services and more on equity .
Medicare , Dean said , " is by nature much more efficient " because currently seniors can move , leave their job and get sick without having their coverage discontinued .
" Everybody over 65 has it and the question is ' Why do n't we open up that program , ' " he said .
[...]
Dean said " we are getting pretty mixed signals from Senator Grassley . …
I think the Republicans owe it to this country to give us a clearer sense of what they will and will not support . "
Senators Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , and Kent Conrad , D - North Dakota , appeared earlier on " Face the Nation , " saying that the public option plan would not find enough support in the Senate .
The co-op solution , they said , would be the only hope for a bipartisan agreement .
Dean also said the $ 600 billion dollar House price tag on health care is " reasonable " because it is less than we are spending in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Greta Van Susteren asks Michael Steele the question that should be asked of Republicans every time they claim they really care about " reforming " health care / insurance .
Why did n't your reform it when you had control of the House , the Senate and the White House ?
Of course she forgets that we did get the Republicans idea of health care reform when they were in charge , with the giveaway to the big pharma in the form of Medicare Part D .
VAN SUSTEREN : All right , what is this " bill of rights " that you 've unleashed ?
And -- well , let me just start there .
What is this " bill of rights " ?
STEELE : Well , the " bill of rights " is really kind of a placeholder as we begin the fall discussion on health care .
We watched at the beginning of the spring and summer the administration say we were going to have a health care bill by July 31 with no real input or discussion by the American people , let alone the Republican members of Congress .
They were going to try to get it done by then .
We raised some concerns and we talked a little bit more about it and laid out clearly what we thought we should be doing .
Town halls began to take place as citizens began to get ahold of it .
And in the process of this discussion , the one thing that struck me that was being left behind was our seniors .
When the administration 's kind of slipped out there the idea of cutting $ 500 billion from the Medicare program with no indication of whether that 's going to be cutting waste or if that 's going to be cutting the substance of programs or what that was , I thought it would be appropriate to put a placemaker out here to very clearly delineate what we should be doing and how we should be doing it on behalf of the seniors as we begin this debate in the fall .
So I wanted to lay out about six principles that kind of talked about the -- you know , the doctor - patient relationship , the role of government , the decision - making process involving seniors or their caregivers , and I wanted to be as fairly clear as I could about it .
VAN SUSTEREN : All right , but this -- so this is not an exact answer to the 1,500 - page bill that the Democrats have put forward .
This is sort of just your principles of how you and the Republican Party would like to see things proceed , so just broad - based principles , right ?
STEELE : It 's broad - based principles and -- and the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate will come back with the legislative , you know , bills and amendments to the HR 3200 or whichever bill the House and Senate are going to be working on , to put into law those guidelines or those protections , if you will , for our seniors .
VAN SUSTEREN : Are the Republicans sort of sitting back , waiting to see what the Democratic bill is so they can then punch some holes in it or rewrite it , or are they -- or are they writing their own , saying , Look , scrap the Democrats .
This is the bill we should have .
STEELE : Well , I think -- well , this is -- that 's a very good question , Greta , and I 'll tell you why , because between the House and the Senate , there have been over 800 pieces of legislation and amendments to various bills introduced by Democrats in the House and the Senate that have been rejected outright .
So they 've tried that , writing the bill , if you will , or putting their input into the documents that have been produced , and it has all been rejected .
So I think in this instance , what I thought was , Let 's put a placemarker in place , then let 's just follow back up .
And now that the rhetoric has heated up from the American people , maybe the House leadership will pay attention to what Republicans want to put on the table because , quite frankly , I 'm sick and tired of all this conversation about all bipartisanship and bipartisanship that , when , in fact , the House and Senate leadership are not doing anything to bring Republicans to the table in any meaningful way , and the president is giving lip service to this idea , when he's not encouraging , and in fact , demanding that we work together in bipartisan fashion on this problem .
VAN SUSTEREN : All right .
Now , I understand that a lot of Republicans want reform .
In fact , most have said some reform is needed .
I understand that they do n't like the public option , or the government option .
I understand that they say there 's no bipartisanship .
But can you sort of , you know -- you know , bring me in on the secret why the Republicans did n't do health care reform when they owned the House , the Senate and the White House ?
Do you have any idea ?
In my adventures in the building of Common Lisp software , I have had to deal more than I wish I had with something that is largely misunderstood , because it is completely crazy : EVAL - WHEN .
In the hope that the loss of my sanity might be redeemed however fractionally by the slightest enlightment of my better , I thought I would write up my conclusions .
Dumping the topic on paper will also hopefully allow me to empty my mind from the sheer horror .
Common Lisp features the notion that processing the code from source text to effective meaning happens in many stages that may or may not be interleaved or distinguished : read - time , macro - expansion - time , compile - time , load - time , execution - time .
EVAL - WHEN allows you to control up to a point what gets evaluated in the latter three " times " .
The interleaving between the evaluation stages comes from the fact that code processing happens one form at a time , with the result of each stage being passed on to the next stage before the next form is read .
This allows for any side - effect by the processor to be effective by the time the next form is processed .
However , depending on whether you 're typing code at the REPL , LOAD ing a Lisp source file , COMPILE - FILE ing it then LOAD ing a compiled file , EVAL ing or COMPILE ing a form , then which of compile - time , load - time and execution - time happens , which is deferred , which does n't happen , and how they interleave with each other and with macro- expansion - time may vary wildly .
Read - time always happens first .
The Lisp processor reads a stream of text ( an unfortunate choice of specification , INTERLISP and Smalltalk fans may tell you ) and dumps CONS cells to represent Lisp code in S - Expression forms ( an unfortunate choice of representation , PLT Scheme fans will tell you ) .
The * READTABLE * , through its macro-characters and its dispatch - macro - characters such as #. , allows you to specify code that is evaluated at read - time , which actually enables you ( though in a painful way ) to locally or globally compile code that uses any syntax of your choice ( see how kpreid does it for E ) .
Macro-expansion time happens second , separately on each toplevel form read by the reader at read - time .
Macro-expansion is specified thanks to DEFMACRO , DEFINE - SYMBOL - MACRO and their lexical variants MACROLET and SYMBOL - MACROLET , as well as the awesome DEFINE - SETF - EXPANDER ( and friend DEFINE - MODIFY - MACRO ) , but also by the tricky DEFINE - COMPILE - MACRO and the not - so - great * MACROEXPAND - HOOK * .
Common Lisp macros are at the same time all - powerful ( being able to transform any source code into any other source code ) and all - ignorant ( being unable to track the surrounding lexical context or original source location , and limited in how they may analyze the enclosed lexical content short of reimplementing a full code walker for CL and any implementation - defined extension that you or the libraries you use might depend on ) .
This causes minor but nagging issues with lack of hygiene , difficulty to trace errors , but more importantly , it makes it impossible to write non-local transformations in a modular way , short of reinventing a whole new system to replace the current one or somehow sit on top of it ( but then one might find that because the * MACROEXPAND - HOOK * is n't called on special forms and normal syntax , one needs to shadow a lot of standard forms and / or hack the reader altogether if one wants to intercept everything without requiring the user to wrap each form in a magic wrapper ) .
Then the processor goes through some stages of evaluation : either compilation that may or may not be followed by loading , or direct execution that may or may not involve some kind of compilation .
Whichever stages happen then may or may not be themselves interleaved with the macro-expansion of the given form itself : it is allowed for the implementation to start compiling or executing part of a form while the rest of it is n't macroexpanded , or to fully macroexpand before it compiles ( though full macroexpansion does require at least some level of code - walking and lexical scope analysis to distinguish actual macros from other forms that happen to use the same symbols as macros ) .
If you are typing code at the REPL , LOAD ing a Lisp source file , or EVAL uating some form , then the execution - time happens and only it happens , with all its side - effects .
Any EVAL - WHEN turns into a PROGN if it contains the : EXECUTE clause , otherwise into NIL .
Note that this may or may not be interleaved with macro-expansion , so that for instance , SBCL may start evaluating ( when nil ( foo ) ) and reduce it to NIL without ever expanding the macro ( foo ) , so that if you were expecting this expansion to happen and cause side - effects , you 'll be surprised to find it wo n't ( as we were when testing ASDF - DEPENDENCY - GROVEL ) .
If you are calling COMPILE on some code , said code is also to be run in a future :EXECUTE - time and EVAL - WHEN behaves as above .
Because the code to be compiled has to be a function ( named or anonymous ) , there is no toplevel , and :COMPILE - TOPLEVEL or :LOAD - TOPLEVEL clauses are irrelevant and ignored .
If I understand correctly , the compiler is also allowed to not expand macros when it can statically prove that they are in an unreachable piece of code ; however , in practice , the way compilers are typically written in passes , macros are often fully expanded by the time any advanced analysis happens based on which such dead code could be eliminated .
Where EVAL - WHEN behaves differently is when you are using COMPILE - FILE and when you LOAD the result of a FASL resulting from such a COMPILE - FILE .
In these cases , each toplevel form after expansion ( or interleaved with it ) is processed in a way that separates some effects that happen at compile - time and effects that are to happen at load - time .
The :COMPILE - TOPLEVEL clause of an EVAL - WHEN indicates that all enclosed effects are to happen at compile - time ( i.e. they happen in the current image , and they are also dumped in the CFASL if you use them in SBCL 1.0.30.4 or later , so they may happen when each time said CFASL is loaded in this image or a future one ) .
The :LOAD - TOPLEVEL clause of an EVAL - WHEN indicates that all enclosed effects are to happen at load - time ( i.e. they are dumped in the FASL and will happen each time said FASL is LOAD ed , in this image or a future one , but they do not happen in the current image unless the : COMPILE - TOPLEVEL clause was also specified ) .
Some special forms have effects at both compile - time and load - time , such as IN - PACKAGE that changes the current package at both times , or DEFVAR that will declare the variable special at compile - time in addition to declaring it and optionally setting it at load - time , etc .
The :EXECUTE clause is ignored at the toplevel ( but it and only it remains meaningful in non-toplevel subforms ) .
In practice , — and if you only need to remember one thing about EVAL - WHEN , this is it , — only three combinations are safe , and then again , only one is useful : ( EVAL - WHEN ( : COMPILE - TOPLEVEL :LOAD-TOPLEVEL :EXECUTE ) ... ) should wrap things that need be available in the compilation environment as well as the target environment , such as the functions , variables and side - effects used by macros themselves ; it is the only combination that is both useful and safe .
(: LOAD - TOPLEVEL :EXECUTE ) is safe , but it is the implicit default around any toplevel form and thus you never need to specify it explicitly , except possibly to restrict the effects of a surrounding EVAL - WHEN when used inside a macro that may expand to such thing ( which would be poor style ) .
(: COMPILE-TOPLEVEL :EXECUTE ) is the last safe combination , but its utility is very restricted .
It is to be used for side - effects you only want in the compilation environment , most notably local modification of the readtable .
Now , such a side effect will happen when you originally compile the file , and unless to some locally bound symbol like the * READTABLE * , it will persist in the session where you compile but not further sessions that are restarted from already compiled FASLs , causing non-deterministic havoc in incremental ASDF builds .
Note that modifications to the readtable object itself ( as opposed to a copy of it ) will indeed be such " maybe escaping , maybe not " side effects ; if you 're going to customize the readtable , I recommend you spare yourself some aggravation and use named - readtables .
File - system access to compute anything non-deterministic will similarly be very bad taste ( If deterministic , you may want to do it at read - time , and if not , you may want to defer it until image - dump - time ) .
One redeeming context for the use for such combination for lasting side - effects is when you use XCVB while enabling SBCL's CFASL mechanism ( present since SBCL 1.0.30.4 ) , which is n't portable to other implementations ( yet ) , but will guarantee that the enclosed side - effects will be replayed before compiling each file that depends on yours , and none other .
To summarize , this combination , while safe , is for very special restricted usage patterns .
Unless you 're an expert , do n't try this combination ; and do n't even think of using other combinations .
Indeed all other combinations are bogus , except imaginably in the guts of some fairly low - level optimization macro , because there will always be cases when they wo n't do what you think , depending on how the source file is being processed .
i.e. the user may depending on his needs either LOAD the source or COMPILE - FILE it then LOAD of the FASL , or he may only LOAD the FASL in a new image to incrementally re-compile a previously compiled system with ASDF , and your code should behave reasonably well and mean the same thing in all these cases .
Finally , when a FASL or CFASL file is loaded , the dumped side - effects happen : symbols are interned , LOAD - TIME - VALUE s are computed , function , variables and macros are defined , any toplevel side - effect happens , etc .
Note that read - time and macro- expansion time were considered neither compile - time nor load - time side - effects and thus should not be present in either CFASL or FASL .
This is actually a feature , as it allows one to use side effects while reading or macro- expanding , without the same side - effects having to be dumped then later replayed at load - time .
Indeed they wo n't be dumped with SBCL and other sane implementations , though there might or might not conceivably exist crazier implementations .
However , if there are side - effects you do at macro- expansion - time , you want to persist and be replayed at compile - time - time ( when using CFASLs ) or load - time ( when using FASLs ) , then your macros should typically expand to code that includes the same side - effects at compile - time and / or load - time through the proper use of EVAL - WHEN , in addition to ( or in replacement to ) said code being evaluated at macro- expansion - time ( if needed ) .
While migrating a big project from ASDF to XCVB , I have notably had to debug a macro that was using ( EVAL ( DEFCLASS ... ) ) and a FINALIZE - INHERITANCE at macroexpansion time so as to be able to invoke the MOP and query the parsed class , but was failing to include the DEFCLASS in the expansion , thus working in a build from clean , but causing failures when building incrementally from ASDF , or when building deterministically from XCVB , as some macro- expansions in further files were expecting the class to have been defined and its inheritance finalized , which they would not be when loading from FASLs .
Nobody 's picking Rutgers to win its first Big East football championship this fall .
In fact , the conference preseason writers ' poll had the Scarlet fifth in a down conference .
But this is the start of training camp , and hope springs eternal .
So here are five reasons that Rutgers will shock the world this year , win the Big East and head to a BCS bowl ( Okay , some seem more likely than others ) .
Read these reasons and then post your top five list in comments .
1 ) The Big East is rebuilding : Cincinnati loses much of its awesome defense , West Virginia does n't have Pat White , UConn lost stud RB Donald Brown -- so teams will beat each other up all year
2 ) True freshman Tom Savage emerges at quarterback : Studying pays off , and he eventually becomes a big , tough team leader - a freshman QB who looks like an NFL prototype and plays like a senior .
( No pressure , kid . )
3 ) Favorable home schedule : Pitt , WVU and Cincy just are n't that good this year , and Rutgers takes advantage of home games against all three , their stiffest competition .
4 ) Homefield advantage : Fans showing up in droves to the newly enclosed Rutgers Stadium make it a house of horrors for opponents .
It 's so loud opposing offenses can't operate .
RU wins every home game , except for an inexplicable letdown against FIU ( Isiah Thomas in the house ) , to the delight of a fully converted Rutgers 1000 , who now endorse Division 1 athletics and further stadium expansion at the New Jersey state university .
5 ) The big picture :
The improved jumbo video screen at Rutgers Stadium helps a referee ( despite the rules ) correct a botched call on the last play of the regular season against West Virginia .
After a zebra huddle , Rutgers wins the game , snaps the WVU jinx and takes the Big East , thanks to the fine print way down the tie - breaker list .
Okay , those are my top five reasons .
Rutgers fans , post your top five reasons Rutgers is going to win the Big East this season .

One of the things I learned early on in my journalism career is that words have power .
They also have consequences .
Fortunately , I have a conscience .
I credit my Catholic upbringing for that .
I found so much to admire in the concepts of social justice and compassion with which I was raised , and even though I 'm not longer a Catholic , I still take exception to the way these so - called Catholics distort the faith .
It infuriates me when I see people like these distort and twist the truth about healthcare reform - for what reason ?
I mean , they 're pretty much the scrubs of the right wing , a bunch of has - beens and wannabes .
Do they do it to feed their egos ?
To keep the cocktail - party invitations flowing ?
Let 's look at this group of " moral " leaders who are fighting so desperately to save the elderly from socialist liberal euthanasia .
It 's mostly older people who watch " The McLaughlin Group , " I think , so the antics of these clowns mostly fly below the radar - just like talk radio .
John McLaughlin is the former Jesuit priest who cared so deeply about God , he quit the order rather than give up his speechwriting gig with Richard Nixon .
Pat Buchanan , a good friend of McLaughlin's and the Nixon speechwriter who got him the job , is a product of Jesuit schools and presents himself as a Catholic so conservative , he still goes to the Latin Mass .
He has occasional lapses in which he actually tells the truth , but these are so few and far between , it 's not worth mentioning .
Pat is generally is so willing to distort reality , it 's a given .
If Pat vehemently tells you the sky is blue , stick your head out the window and check .
Monica Crowley , another Nixon employee , is a Fox News " analyst " - i.e. someone paid to twist and mold the truth into something to inflames passions against Democrats .
( By the way , her sister , Dr. Jocelyn Crowley , is married to Hannity 's former co-host , Alan Colmes . )
Apparently she 's pretty good at distorting truth :
Crowley was accused of plagiarism in 1999 for an article she authored titled " The Day Nixon Said Goodbye " that appeared in the The Wall Street Journal .
After accusations of plagiarism from at least one reader , an acknowledgement of " striking similarities " between Crowley 's article and an article by Paul Johnson titled " In Praise of Richard Nixon " in the October 1988 issue of Commentary Magazine was published .
A Journal editor stated , " Had we known of the parallels , we would not have published the article . "
Crowley acknowledged the similarity between the pieces , and said " there are clear similarities in the language .
I have wracked my brain , and I can honestly tell you that I have not read [ Johnson 's article ] . "
An article in Slate Magazine detailed five specific passages in Crowley 's article that contained identical language and phraseology to Johnson 's piece , and concluded that " it just is n't possible for Crowley not to have read Johnson 's article . "
There is something called " The Ten Commandments , " and Christians generally agree that it 's important .
John , Pat , Monica and their ilk simply ignore any of those commandments that are politically inconvenient ( " Thou shalt not bear false witness " ) or they apply them selectively ( " Thou shalt not kill " only applies to fetuses , and not Iraqi children ) .
They dig out obscure parts of the Old Testament they insist mean Jesus condemned gay people , and yet they still eat shrimp and lobster - condemned in the same book of the Bible .
We already know they will do or say anything that will further their political cause and erode ours .
So spare me the wide eyes and crocodile tears .
No one 's suggesting we off old people , and they know it .
They 're just so shameless and cynical , they could n't resist .
Everyone knows if liberals really believed in killing people when they 're no longer productive , people like McLaughlin and Buchanan would n't be here .
Dear Cecil :
To hear a lot of people tell it , up until some indeterminate date in the 20th century , everyone in Europe and the United States stank to high heaven .
Supposedly no one washed , brushed their teeth , etc ; everyone had lice ; and so on .
Is it true that the average 12th - century European , if he showed up in a modern room , could clear out the joint by stench alone in three seconds ?
Were lice the social norm ?
Would everyone 's rotting - tooth breath knock us on our asses ?
If so , at what point did matters improve ?
I 'm imagining myself transported back in time to a room where the Founding Fathers are debating what to do about the Crown 's injustices , and almost passing out from the stink .
What makes me skeptical that hygiene was so awful is that I often read of someone being particularly malodorous ; if everything already stank horrifically , then how could people tell that someone had BO ?
Who had grounds to nitpick anyone else 's pungency ?
Jonathan , via e-mail
Cecil replies :
Come on , Jonathan — a little body odor never killed anybody .
Truth is , we live in an impoverished age , olfactorily speaking .
Up until , say , World War I — some would put the date as late as 1950 — human beings lived in a rich stew of scents , some revolting but a few delightful and many at least comfortingly familiar .
Nowadays people in the developed world can go for days without sniffing anything more pungent than kung pao chicken at the food court .
Progress has rid us of some pretty rank smells , but we tossed out some good ones too .
You heard right — people in the old days did stink to high heaven .
What with domestic animals , nonexistent sanitation and refrigeration , and ( after 1800 ) crowding and pollution , pretty much everything stank .
Efforts were made to alleviate the stench , the most famous result being the public baths of Rome , but the more common practice was to disguise foul scents with fairer ones .
A wealthy party host was expected to tickle his guests ’ olfactory receptors with exotic perfumes , incense , and ointments .
If he did n’t they ’d be more likely to smell the chamber pots — separate toilet rooms draining to a cesspool were n’t common until the 19th century .
Probably the low point in terms of BO was reached during the Renaissance .
In the Middle Ages public baths had been available in larger towns ; while these were more recreational than hygienic and often did a good side business as brothels , you could get clean if you wanted to .
In the wake of the plague , though , Europeans decided baths were dangerous .
Hot water allowed toxins to penetrate the skin — better to keep the pores caulked with healthy grime .
A grossed - out Muslim in the Arabian Nights suggested that once Christians were doused with baptismal water they felt entitled to avoid bathing for the rest of their lives .
Personal grooming , such as it was , focused entirely on appearances .
People washed their faces and hands sometimes but refused to immerse their entire bodies except on doctors ’ orders .
The rich drenched themselves with perfume to conceal odor .
Lice and fleas were universal , etiquette requiring merely that one refrain from scratching conspicuously in public .
People were used to a baseline level of putridity ; to attract attention , you had to really reek .
This noxious state of affairs persisted for centuries .
One small step forward was the wearing of underclothing , preferably of white linen — dirt would rub off on the linen , which you could wash every few weeks without having to wash yourself .
The prejudice against water began to recede in the 18th century , but bathing remained an aristocratic luxury ( later extended to the bourgeoisie ) for another 150 years .
( Not that the aristos set much of an example — it ’s said Versailles stank due to bluebloods relieving themselves in corners . )
Partly it was a matter of expense — for those too modest to simply jump in the river , the only bathing facilities were public bathhouses , revived in popularity but out of most people ’s price range .
It ’s estimated that in 1819 the 700,000 inhabitants of Paris collectively purchased only 600,000 baths .
Change came gradually .
In an at least semiscientific attempt to combat epidemics , cities began installing waterworks and sewer systems .
Indoor bathrooms became more common , although they were n’t standard until the 20th century .
Mass - produced soap appeared .
Autos and milk trains made it possible to keep horses and cows and their offal out of cities .
The middle class , with the energetic assistance of advertisers , realized that bad smells were n’t the inevitable lot of mankind .
Even so , the modern cult of cleanliness , including daily showers and deodorant , did n’t take firm root in the U.S. until after World War II .
Nowadays , thanks to air conditioning , kitchen fans , and for that matter fewer home - cooked meals ( at my house , anyway ) , even cooking smells are fading away .
I ’m not complaining about the sterility of modern life in a literal sense — who wants cholera back ? — but the world of abundant smells is one we have largely left behind .

It appears that routine searches of one ’s home to check for a vast array of “ problems ” are now performed door - to - door in The Netherlands .
The city of The Hague is inspecting all homes in a number of neighborhoods .
One resident , that apparently told these people to bugger off at a previous occasion , got a threatening letter .
Translated to English , it says :
Subject : Inspection regarding occupancy relating to The Hague Residence Brigade In The Hague , we want pleasant and safe neighborhoods .
For this reason , we are inspecting all homes in your neighborhood .
For each address , we will see if the rules and regulations are met .
The residence you own at < blank > was visited by our team on the 10th of June2009 , but we were refused entrance .
On Thursday the 25h of June between 13:00 and 14:00 your residence will be visited again by a team of the “ The Hague Residence Brigade ” led by the City Planning Office .
We will verify the state of the building , ( fire ) safety and the actual use of the residence .
All rooms of the residence are subject to this inspection .
The cooperation of all residents is therefore a necessity .
We ’d like to point out that this is not a voluntary inspection .
You are obliged to cooperate .
If you refuse to cooperate , we ’d like to point out that we are legally entitled to enter the premises with a legal warrant and without the cooperation of the owner and / or occupant (s ) .
If the date or time are not convenient for you , you have the option to , within 5 working days after postmark of this letter , call the above number Monday through Friday between 08:00 and 16:00 .
If an illegal situation is found during the investigation , you will receive notice about further proceedings as soon as possible .
We trust his letter has provided you with all the necessary information .
City Planning Office
Department for Building , Inspection and Service Ms. C. Kolenmijn
Inspector Project The Hague Residence Brigade
Note the sentence “ In The Hague , we want pleasant and safe neighborhoods ” , stifling any criticism before it even got underway .
I remember when “ safe ” was when the government did n’t get to search your house without a suspicion and decent legal oversight .
A look at the website of the municipality sheds some further light on this operation :
Since the 15th of April the The Hague Residence Brigade is active in three The Hague power neighborhoods : Transvaal , Stationsbuurt / Rivierenbuurt and Schilderswijk .
The The Hague Residence Brigade ( the former “ catch - up enforcement ” ) targets , among other things , over - population , mariuana plantations and social benefit fraud .
By tackling these problems , the city intends to create safer and more livable neighborhoods . [ … ]
The Brigade also checks whether occupants are registered with the municipality and traces social benefit fraud .
For this purpose a team has been formed from many different municipal services which cooperates with the police , fire brigade , tax authorities and the local energy company .
This integrated approach allows for the effective handling of a wide variety of problems .
It gets downright ominous and scary further down .
In what sounds like a bad parody , The Hague tells its inhabitants : “ We ’re from the government and we ’re here to help ” :
In the past three neighborhoods in The Hague have been inspected by this team ( Regentesse - , Valkenboskwartier , Rustenburg / Oostenbroek and Laak ) .
All the addresses in a neighborhood were looked at .
First digitally by coupling the databases of the various services and when needed by house visits .
Since the end of 2005 , 19.000 inspections were performed .
During the inspections in the power neighborhoods , the social aspect will be more pronounced .
In the The Hague Residence Brigade finds social problems , the appropriate code will be reported at the municipal registry “ Den Haag OpMaat ” .
Through this code the appropriate caregivers are mobilized .
This could be psychological help , addiction care or the center for youth and family .
This way , the municipality can reach inhabitants that are not yet familiar with the help and support the municipality can offer .
For those wondering , unlike the name suggests the term “ power neighborhood ” ( dutch : krachtwijk ) is the current dutch politically correct euphemism for a neighborhood that is n’t doing all that well .
It used to be “ wonderful neighborhood ” ( dutch : prachtwijk ) .
This story has made some dutch weblogs , but by and large the Dutch do n’t see much wrong with what ’s going on here .
After all , if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear .
And the government is just trying to help .
I blame the ongoing crisis in our educational system .
So let this be a warning to other countries .
It will take a while to kick in , but this is what you get if you turn your educational system into a “ highly efficient ” privatized diploma - factory .
Either way : the minute I get one of these letters , I will sue .
If I lose , I ’ll sell my house and move to Berlin .

This is hardly a new issue , but it 's still troubling every time we hear a story like this .
For years , there 's been a fight over whether or not it should be legal to modify a legally purchased game console .
Those in favor of the right point out that if you 've legally bought something , you should always be free to tinker with it .
That 's just common sense .
Those against it say that modifying a gaming console is done mainly to play pirated games or to cheat , which can cause problems for legit players .
I find the latter responses unpersuasive , as those are technological or business model issues that can be solved in other ways , rather than a legal issue .
But , thanks to that good old DMCA , that 's now how the law works .
Instead , we get stories about students getting arrested for " jailbreaking " a video game console .
It 's interesting to see the use of the word " jailbreaking " here , as that 's more commonly been applied to iPhones -- where it 's common .
Usually , this action has been referred to as " modding " or " modchipping " when it came to consoles .
But the basic fact is that the actions are effectively the same -- and both should be perfectly legal .
Modifying legally purchased hardware should never be against the law .
It 's possible that you could thenthat modified hardware to break the law -- and no one 's saying that 's okay .
But the act itself of modifying the devices should never be against the law -- especially where it could lead to a ten - year prison sentence , as in this case .
This particular case involves a student who would modify game consoles to let people make use of backup copies of their own games on the consoles .
Making a backup copy , by itself , has been well established as being perfectly legal .
The problem here ( once again ) is the DMCA 's anti-circumvention clause , which makes it illegal to circumvent any kind of DRM , even if it 's for a totally legal purpose .
It 's difficult to see how that 's constitutional .
Making it illegal to do something that 's perfectly legal , just because someone puts any kind of DRM in the middle does n't make any sense at all .
It 's a ridiculous scenario that this kid is now facing 10 years in jail for making video game consoles more useful , allowing people to use perfectly legal backup copies of their games .
But , such is the state of the DMCA and copyright laws these days .

The Apollo navigation computer needed to be small and reliable , and it could n’t use much power , so it was built with some of the first integrated circuits — and something called LOL memory :
These used copper wires threaded through or around tiny magnetic cores to produce the ones and zeroes of binary code at the heart of the software .
Pass the copper wire through the core and the computer read it as a one .
Pass it around and it was read as a zero .
“ Once you get it wired it ’s not going to change without breaking those wires , ” said Mr Hall .
The rope core memories would become know as “ LOL memory ” after the “ little old ladies ” who knitted together the software at a factory just outside Boston .
These ladies would sit in pairs with a memory unit between them , threading metres and metres of slender copper wires through and around the cores .
“ It ’s an extremely time - consuming process and it meant that the programs had to be finished and fully tested months in advance , ” said Mr Eyles .
“ But it is extremely robust – that information probably still exists despite being left on the Moon . ”
To ensure reliability and the highest possible standards from the ladies , Nasa also chose to go on a PR mission to the factories .
“ We used to go to the cafeteria and the astronauts would come in , ” said Mary Lou Rogers , one of the ladies who worked on the Apollo line .
“ They ’d explain the Moon shot and thank us for what a good job we were doing .
“ Everybody got all excited when they came in — we were a bunch of married women with children . ”
However , Nasa did not just leave quality control to good will and chance , said Mrs Rogers , who also worked on Intercontinental Ballistic Missile programmes .
“ [ Each component ] had to be looked at by three of four people before it was stamped off .
We had a group of inspectors come in for the Federal Government to check our work all the time . ”
“ It was bad when we worked on Poseidon and Trident .
But nothing as bad as when we were on Apollo . ”
What Makes Acai Burn Extreme so Different ?
The biggest difference is that it is specifically designed for men .
Men have very different levels of testosterone , estrogen ; they metabolize fats and proteins in different ways .
All these differences mean that a weight loss product designed for a woman will not have the same effect on a man .
AcaiBurn has just developed a unique blend of active ingredients that are specifically designed to help you stay fit , lose weight and have more energy without starving yourself .
Breast - Feeding Doll Too Real for Comfort ?
A toy that mimics breast - feeding on girls ' chests is causing an uproar .
Aug. 7 , 2009  --
American girls own dolls that pee , dolls that suck on a bottle , dolls that burp or sit on a potty -- and all are accepted as appropriate by most adults .
But a new doll that breast - feeds has pitted expert against expert and mom against mom over whether this toy has gone too far .
None can seem to agree if the Spanish - made Bebe Gloton doll is natural , useful or disgusting .
The doll is currently sold only in Spain , though Berjuan , the company that makes the toy , said that it will be marketed in the United States next year .
The doll allows children to imitate the act of breast - feeding by using a special halter top that comes with the toy .
The halter top is made from a colorful material with two flowers positioned where nipples would be .
When the mouth of the doll is brought close to a sensor embedded in the flower , the baby makes motions and sounds consistent with suckling .
Cesar Bernabeu , director of sales and marketing for Berjuan , wrote in an e-mail to ABCNews.com that psychologists and teachers were consulted in the development of the toy , and that it has garnered the approval of the Asociacion Pro-Lacttancia Meterna de Espana , a pro-breast - feeding organization in Spain .
" We realized that the reaction was so positive with the girls when they were imitating their moms and saw that they react to the doll like it was a little sister , " read Bernabeu 's remarks , translated from Spanish .
" Their faces of happiness said it all . "
However , a viral video demonstration on YouTube has been met with remarks that the doll is over - sexualizing young girls , or forcing girls to grow up too quickly , or teaching young girls about a natural part of motherhood .
The company responded to the concerns in their email .
" Breast - feeding is completely natural ; it is not something that we have invented ourselves , it is something that is done all around the world , " Bernabeu wrote .
" There are studies that discuss the benefits of breastfeeding , and there are associations around the world that are ... supporting this . "
But not all mothers agree .
" I heard people talking about it but , honestly , I thought it was a joke , " said Ilina Ewen , a writer for the Deep South Moms and her own blog Dirt and Noise .
" There are just things that I think kids are too little to understand , " she said .
Ewen worried that if her two boys , ages 4 and 6 , saw the toy , they would be confused because neither had been breast - fed .
Yet Ewen admits she has seen many young girls mimic the behavior after watching their mothers nurse their infant siblings .
" They do n't understand they just see other moms doing that .
Let kids use their imagination and play with a doll and not deal with what it can do , " Ewen said .
" There 's no need to turn it into something that 's anatomically correct .
Not at this age . "
Why Does Breast - Feeding Doll Breed Controversy ?
Other mothers see this as a perfectly normal toy not worthy of such controversy .
" I can't believe what upsets people , " said Jessica Gottlieb , a mommy blogger and mother of a " school age " boy and girl .
Gottlieb has seen her own daughter mimic breast - feeding after watching her nurse her infant son .
She thinks all the talk about how the doll sexualizes children says a lot about society .
" That they [ critics ] would jump from a breast - feeding doll ... that you would take a child feeding and would automatically sexualize it says more about you then the doll , " she said .
" It 's a doll .
If you do n't like it , do n't buy it . "
Even pediatricians , child development and toy experts can't agree on whether the nod to support breast - feeding in the Bebe Gloton ( loosely translated as baby glutton ) would be healthy for young girls .
" My take is that anything which reminds young girls that their bodies are something other , and more , than sex objects , is a very good thing , " said Dr. Ronald Cohen , medical director of the Mothers ' Milk Bank in San Jose , Calif .
" On the other hand , encouraging young girls to want to have babies at a very young age may not be so great , " said Cohen , who is also the director of the intermediate intensive care nursery at Lucile Packard Children 's Hospital at Stanford University .
But mom-blogger Carrie Lauth does n't see a difference between encouraging adult play with a toy stroller or toy bottle and encouraging adult play with a breast - feeding doll .
" It 's definitely something I would consider buying for my daughters because I 've purchased in the past items that mimic what I do , like little baby slings for their dolls , " said Lauth , a writer for Natural Moms Talk Radio .
" I think it 's a fantastic idea , I do n't ' understand why it's a controversy , " she said .
That line -- where playing parent meets the reality of parenting -- seems different for each expert too .
Psychologist Jay Reeve , CEO of the Apalachee Center in Tallahassee , Fla. , said Bebe Gloton 's realism goes too far .
What Psychologists
Think of the Breast - Feeding Doll
" Of course , children have played ' parent ' with dolls for centuries , but this new twist seems to focus not on what babies are like as much as jumpstarting a focus on breast - feeding , " Reeve said .
" I 'm always a little disturbed by toys , games , or products that have the impact of accelerating childhood identification with being a full - blown adult . "
Yet toy expert , professor and author Diane Levin , said the problem with Bebe Gloton is n't the breast - feeding .
Levin has a problem with any toy that limits the play to a single activity .
" It 's not good for children to have everything structured for them , " said Levin , co-author of " So Sexy So Soon : The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their Kids . "
Levin has witnessed girls pretending to breast - feed dolls -- especially after seeing their mothers nurse siblings -- and thought it perfectly natural .
But she said play , including boys playing soldiers , needs to be spontaneous and initiated by the child .
" As kids get used to instructive toys , they need more structured toys , " Levin said .
" We take the creativity away . "
Some of the drivers that bought new cars through cash for clunkers are learning that it was n't quite the deal they hoped for .
Keloland Television :
But many of those cashing in on the clunkers program are surprised when they get to the treasurer 's office windows .
That 's because the government 's rebate of up to $ 4500 dollars for every clunker is taxable .
" They did n't realize that would be taxable .
A lot of people do n't realize that .
So they 're not happy and kind of surprised when they find that out , " Nelson said .
We imagine that MOST people did n't know the rebates were taxable .
We certainly did n't .
Karl Denninger calls this hilarious , and explains the mix up :
The amusement here is how most ( if not all ) states compute sales tax ( charged when you register the vehicle . )
When you buy a new car you pay tax on the difference between the new car 's purchase price and the trade - in you present to the dealer .
This is an intentional distortion in the law that is intended to favor dealers over private - party used car sales ; if you sell your used car privately the new buyer pays sales tax but you do not get the offset on the purchase of your replacement vehicle - the only way to get that is to trade the car .
Dealers use this , of course , in negotiations , effectively pocketing the sales tax - and why not ?
It 's a real difference to you !
But the " cash for clunkers " is not a trade - in .
That 's a $ 4,500 check from the government , basically .
So you get nailed at least once and possibly twice .
Specifically , you pay sales tax on the full vehicle price ( effectively paying sales tax on the $ 4,500 ! ) and what 's worse those states that tax income ( that would be most of them ! ) might wind up counting this as income for state income tax purposes too , effectively taxing you twice .

Add actress Megan
Fox to the long list of celebrities " to fall victim to having topless photos leaked to the media , " said Cristina Everett in the New York Daily News .
But this time there 's a new twist .
Fox says she knows who 's responsible for releasing the images taken on the set of the upcoming film Jennifer 's Body , but she 's counting on Karma — instead of a lawsuit — to settle the score .
There 's a good reason for that , said Gawker .
These photos surfaced on the Internet a while ago .
But Megan
Fox is trying to drum up publicity ahead of the release of the new Transformers movie , so it makes perfect sense that she has chosen to remind everyone of the photos ' existence this week .
There 's no denying that Megan Fox is doing her best to get the world 's attention , said Star Pulse .
The " 23 - year - old mega - babe " has embarked on a global hotness tour , snaring headlines with the " scandalous " red dress she wore to the Berlin premiere of Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
Fox has been photographed in a series of steamy outfits as she promotes the movie .
And her shocking comments — defending her tattoos , likening acting to prostitution , advocating legalized marijuana — show that she does n't need to show skin to be noticed .

Intense music and vibrant colours came to the Home Counties in 1989
On the world stage , 1989 was the year of the collapse of communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall .
In the UK , the music scene also stands out in the memory as the year when the Manchester sound caught the imagination and Eurodance music hit the charts .
But the headline - grabbing phenomenon was the growth of law - defying rave parties that filled warehouses and fields in south - east England .
The tabloid press concentrated on the drug culture associated with the all - night acid house parties , but overlooked the restrictive licensing laws which prompted the mass gatherings .
Radio 1 and club DJ Judge Jules , now 42 , who played sets at numerous events shares his recollections as part of a series on the music of 1989 .
I DJed at a lot of the parties .
I was on a pirate radio station at the time and was booked to play a lot of the larger ones that made the press .
I had residencies at clubs and would do later sets at the raves .
A lot of people tie the acid house parties to the development of drug culture , but the other significant development is n't often mentioned .
Judge Jules says there was a spontaneity about rave culture
The licensing laws at the time were very conservative .
The majority of clubs outside London closed at 2 am , if you were lucky some London clubs shut at 3 .
The streets of London after that time were completely different to what they are now - it 's a true 24 - hour international city today .
1989 was the beginning of those times and a burgeoning demand of kids then .
Clubs at the time neither understood nor wanted to embrace something that was different musically .
There would be flyers for the raves , but there would never be a location .
There would be a series of mobile phone numbers which you'd be expected to call .
Even as a DJ , I did n't know where the party was going to be .
They might give you a county and a back - up location , but I had to do the same as everyone else - attempt to work out where I was going .
There was an awful lot of police outside the raves but the promoters tried to get as many people in the area as possible so the police would be too understaffed to close the party down .
The parties themselves did n't necessarily feel like youth culture history because there 'd been an evolution towards the huge events .
RAVER'S RECOLLECTION
Sam Williams
My friends and I all lived 30 miles outside of London and this rave wave was exciting and fresh .
We 'd never heard this kind of music .
We went to parties in fields and empty warehouses - a far cry from the cheesy discos we were used to .
The buzz at the raves was contagious and the feeling mutual .
The hypnotic music and happy crowd made you feel at one with yourself .
The feeling of unity was overwhelming , with a huge sense of belonging and freedom .
We loved the excitement of meeting up with people and joining convoys listening out for loud music , looking for lasers and landing in a field with a 50 k sound system .
This whole scene took over our lives .
Sam Williams ( pictured in 1989 ) now runs the ravereunited website and is compiling a book about the raves of 1989 .
But what did make it feel like a revolution was that you 'd come out of an event and the papers had written about it across their front pages .
They enormously overplayed the drugs aspect - the music was ultimately the revolution .
It was part of an evolution towards dance music being hugely successful in the early 90s when the chart was dominated by it .
I was too young at the time to view it as something special .
Those times were great , I made new friends , developed a DJing career and it allowed me to do what I always dreamed of doing .
I 'm not enough of a fantasist and idealist to think that I could ever go back to those days , but it does n't make them any less poignant and memorable .
I remember doing one big rave in the open air and I was wearing a yellow jacket which was attacked by wasps in the middle of my set .
Silly memories like that are part of the bigger fabric .
The spontaneity of it all was one of the most fabulous parts - we 'd always end up at the house of someone we'd never met before afterwards , in some Home Counties location that you 'd never have predicted .
The legacy of rave culture is Britain once again cementing its place at the hub of global youth culture .

Toronto's Pride
Week may have seen its last cheque from Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government after this year 's $ 400,000 contribution provoked a backlash from within the ranks of MPs and Conservative supporters .
And Tourism Minister Diane Ablonczy appears to have been disciplined for the controversy , losing her power to announce handouts from the $ 190 million Marquee Tourism Events Program , which gave money to the event .
Brad Trost , a Saskatchewan Conservative MP , spoke out this week against federal support for Pride Week , arguing that the caucus and Harper 's office were caught off guard by Ablonczy 's announcement of support for the event .
" The pro-life and the pro-family community should know and understand that the tourism funding money that went to the gay pride parade in Toronto was not government policy , was not supported by – I think it 's safe to say by a large majority – of the MPs , " Trost said in an interview with LifeSiteNews.com , a website founded by the Campaign Life organization .
Darren Cunningham , a spokesman for Industry Minister Tony Clement , confirmed yesterday that future financial help for Toronto 's Pride Week was " under review " but said that was not directly related to Conservative dissent .
" We 're in the midst of doing a review of the program and that review is to ensure that the funding is providing genuine stimulus to the economy and we 'll have to look at it in that light , " Cunningham said , noting that federal support of the Calgary Stampede and the Vancouver International Jazz Festival , for example , faces the same review .
The Marquee program was set up by the Conservatives as a two - year fund to " stimulate the growth of tourism and contribute to the development of Canada 's visitor economy over the long term . "
However , Cunningham acknowledged that the moral outcry from social conservatives is being heard .
" I know that certainly there 's going to be folks who have their concerns and they 've raised those concerns with us about the program .
We 're listening . "
Sources said the Pride Week grant sparked a crisis at the highest levels of the Harper government .
" It was seen as a poke in the eye " to social conservatives , said one senior insider , noting the Prime Minister is wary of alienating a key part of his base .
Trost , who refused further requests for interviews yesterday , also suggested in his discussion with LifeSiteNews that Ablonczy had been punished for the $ 397,500 grant and that she would no longer have responsibility for tourism announcements .
Cunningham insisted that Ablonczy 's job had not changed , but the minister herself was not talking and her office referred all calls to the industry minister 's office .
The Prime Minister 's spokesman , Kory Teneycke , also referred questions to the communications staff at Industry Canada , which is the senior department overseeing Ablonczy 's ministry of state for tourism and small business .
Tracey Sandilands , executive director of Pride Toronto , said festival organizers accepted the federal contribution this year in the spirit in which it was intended – as stimulus money for the city and its tourism program .
She pointed out that the $ 397,500 went to items such as improved access for disabled people , infrastructure spending and " top- calibre " entertainment .
Nor is this the first time that Harper 's government has set aside money to support Pride in Toronto .
For the past two years , the event received $ 35,000 from Heritage Canada , as well as some smaller grants from Service Canada 's summer jobs program , the Canada Council for the Arts and a sustainability fund at Heritage .
Ablonczy , the MP for Calgary - Nose Hill who famously introduced Harper to his wife , Laureen , was reportedly so impressed by Pride 's " polished and professional " application that she insisted on coming to Toronto to present the cheque in person .
A Conservative source said it was the media coverage that prompted the backlash against Ablonczy .

" The TV shots of her with transvestites inflamed some people , " the source said .
Another Tory insider agreed the sight of drag queens with the minister caused Ablonczy " big- time " trouble because she had not cleared her attendance at the event with Harper 's office .

Scientists in Utah have developed what they term a " molecular condom " , a type of gel which " turns semisolid in the presence of semen , trapping AIDS virus particles in a microscopic mesh " .
" Due to cultural and socioeconomic factors , women often are unable to negotiate the use of protection with their partner , " says Julie Jay , University of Utah doctoral candidate in pharmaceutics , speaking particularly of AIDS - ridden sub-Saharan Africa .
Hence Jay and her colleagues have developed an anti-HIV barrier gel intended for use by women before having sex .
" It flows at a vaginal pH , and the flow becomes slower and slower as pH increases , and it begins to act more solid at the pH of semen , " Jay says .
" We did it to develop technologies that can enable women to protect themselves against HIV without approval of their partner , " adds Patrick Kiser , Utah bioengineering prof .
" This is important – particularly in resource - poor areas of the world like sub-Sahara Africa and south Asia where , in some age groups , as many as 60 per cent of women already are infected with HIV .
In these places , women often are not empowered to force their partners to wear a condom . "
Kiser and Jay believe that their molecular condom , made up of long - chain polymers , would act as an effective barrier to HIV infection on its own .
As vaginal pH returned to normal and the barrier liquefied once more , HIV particles would naturally be " inactivated " - and antiviral drugs could also be included in the gel to help with this .
The molecular - condom tech is to be patented .
The Utah boffins consider that human tests might start in " three to five years " , and delivery of a product some years after that .
Kiser 's team at Utah Uni has recently won a $ 100 k grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation , which will enable the scientists to continue their research .
A new study on the technology will be published this week in the journal Advanced Functional Materials . ®
• ' We do not rule it out or say we will do it ' says manager • Captain would be welcomed back in Emirates dressing room
Arsène Wenger left the door open for Patrick Vieira to push through a dramatic return to Arsenal after he admitted he had considered the " psychological impact " that such a move could have on his dressing room .
Arsenal 's manager , who has retained a close relationship with Vieira despite selling him to Juventus in 2005 after nine successful seasons in north London , is in the market to strengthen in central midfield and confirmed that the proceeds of the sales of Kolo Touré and Emmanuel Adebayor to Manchester City , some £ 39 m , were available for him to spend .
He is hopeful of concluding an £ 8 m deal for the 22 - year - old St Etienne midfielder Blaise Mutuidi but it is the revelation that Vieira , now of Internazionale , would relish a move back to Arsenal that has fuelled the speculation and the excitement of the club 's supporters .
Whether out of courtesy or not , Wenger has not dismissed it .
It remains a slim possibility – Vieira is 33 and he endured a difficult season last time out with injuries and inconsistent form – but it is known that members of the Arsenal backroom staff , not to mention the players , would welcome him back .
" There is a football decision and there is the psychological impact of a player of that stature coming in , " said Wenger .
" At the moment , you need to look at the level of experience in your squad to make this kind of decision .
But we are nowhere near to making a decision like that .
It is a possibility .
We do n't rule it out and we do n't say we will do it . "
Wenger is still close to Vieira , who is determined to enjoy regular football in the countdown to the World Cup finals in South Africa next summer , where he hopes to captain France , and he confirmed the impression that Vieira , who is also coveted by Tottenham Hotspur , would jump at the chance to rejoin Arsenal .
" I am aware that he wants to come back here , " said Wenger .
" Patrick is a legend here and he would always like to come back to this club .
That would be his first choice .
I speak to Patrick , I speak to many players who have been here because I keep good connections with them .
He is a professional footballer with emotion and you always like the club you spend time at .
But as a professional as well , you always give 100 % for whichever club you sign for . "
It has emerged that Vieira turned down Tottenham in January , and when they came back in for him during the current transfer window , he engaged in a bout of soul - searching .
" Legally , no one can stop him joining Tottenham , " Wenger joked .
Tottenham would still like to take him but there is even less chance of Vieira going to White Hart Lane .
Wenger remained tight - lipped over his pursuit of the Bordeaux striker Marouane Chamakh , perhaps because he also has an interest in Real Madrid 's Klaas - Jan Huntelaar , but as he prepared his team for the Emirates Cup – they play Atlético Madrid today and Rangers tomorrow – he insisted that the squad 's focus " should not be on who can help us from outside but who can help us from inside " .
" We have eight defenders , " he continued , " eight or nine midfielders and four strikers , plus the youngsters around , so quality and number - wise , we are where we want to be .
I feel confident and very strong .
The squad 's best time is now . "

I 'm beginning to hope that Democrats will be the large and disorganized centrist party that it was from roughly WWII until Clinton shifted it to the right , and a new party will be the socially liberal and fiscally moderate party that the GOP was , off and on , from Teddy Roosevelt through Nixon up until Reagan dragged it to extremism .
The current Republicans Party will remain the Dixiepubs , the remnants of Strom Thurmond 's " Segregation Forever ! " party that took several states in the 1948 presidential election .
Let the extremists , those big government elitists with no personal responsibility , remain a fringe element of the US political process .
Birthers :
The latest , but not the craziest , bit of insanity from the sphincter conservatives
The Birthers are those on the right who claim Barack Obama was not born a US citizen and therefore not eligible to be president .
They offer no facts proving their assertion .
They just make shit up .
As near as I can figure out , their angry denunciations rely on a few hairy things .
During the campaign , Obama released a Certificate of Live Birth , not a Birth Certificate .
This does n't actually prove he was n't born in the US , please understand , just that it is not an official statement of the place of birth .
Lots of peole have seen it .
The birthers shot themselves in the foot by claiming this was a forgery .
They lied ; the Certificate of Live Birth is legit .
Since the question had been settled , Obama has basically ignored any further calls to release the Birth Certificate .
Some claim he has signed an executive order barring release of his birth certificate .
That 's not precisely true .
Executive Order 13489 , singed January 21 , 2009CE , on Presidential Records , establishes policies related to " executive privilege by incumbent and former Presidents in connection with the release of Presidential records by the National Archives and Records Administration " .
I 'm not a lawyer , but as I read the document a ) it applies to former and current presidents ' claims to Executive Privilege , b ) has all such claims going through the Attorney General , not just a blanket " no " and c ) only applies to records in the National Archives .
A birth certificate is a state document and has nothing to do with Executive Privilege .
Frankly , it looks more like a deal Obama made with Bush about Bush going AWOL from the National Guard more than anything else .
Once again , Republicans are not merely making things up , they 're pointing fingers at the exact opposite culprit .
And once again , Obama is playing it cool , letting the nutjobs spin in circles , further eroding the credibility of the right .
Face it , facts never get in the way of a craven Republican charge or convince a gullible GOP " base " .
Might as well play them for saps .
Of course , what would a conservative screed be without a complete and total lie ?
Can the religious right go a week without bearing false witness ?
No virgins for them ... oh sorry , wrong fanatics , but you get the idea .
It seems that one insecure and self - proclaimed evangelist called up Obama 's 84 - year - old step - grandmother .
She started to say that she was present in Kenya when Obama was born ... which was interpreted as being present at Obama 's birth in Kenya ... when she realized what she had been tricked into and reversed herself .
So what was an phone call affirmation that Barack Obama Jr. was born in Hawaii became , to convicted felon G. Gordon Liddy , " a deposition which is a sworn statement " , indeed , a " written statement " , that he was born in Kenya .
So much for integrity .
So much for " personal responsibility " .
Seriously , these " Christians " need to worry about their immortal souls .
But I digress .
This should be in the next section , as I 'm going to let CatM regale you with the facts , but here is : Liddy Lied :
There is no Deposition from Obama 's step - grandmother Daily Kos Dairy , 7/23/09
But do n't take mere facts get in your way .

The GOP implosion starts at home
Oh , but do n't take the word of comedians and / or newsmen and / or actual documents .
How about taking the word of the nominal party leader , Sen. John McCain , the Republican candidate for president in 2008 .
The rumor was brought to him .
His campaign , no stranger to mud slinging , rumor - mongering and pandering to the far right , took a pass on this one .
McCain Campaign Investigated , Dismissed Obama Citizenship Rumors .
When your party is crazier than a cynical old coot , your party is in trouble .
Rumors and outright lies such as The Born Conspiracy is fed by the conservative news media , from Lou Dobbs to to anyone who does n't challenge the ranting on factual grounds .
One might say that Fox News Is Killing The Republican Party .
So lets .

Mazda , which has been fiddling with hydrogen cars for a long time , is sending some hydrogen - fueled RX - 8 sports cars to Norway .
Norway ?
Yep .
Norway loves the stuff enough to build a hydrogen highway , and Mazda is more than happy to send them some cars that run on it .
Although there 's a lot of debate over hydrogen 's near - term viability , the possibilities it presents are , to paraphrase J. Robert Oppenheimer , just too technically sweet to overlook .
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe , and it creates the opportunity for true zero-emissions propulsion .
But there are some big hurdles to making it work - the distribution infrastructure alone is a big one - and a lot of people say hydrogen remains at least 40 years away .
Most of the major automakers have jumped on the battery electric bandwagon , but Honda remains fiercely committed to hydrogen and has a fleet of Clarity FCX cars running around .
BMW is still pushing hydrogen internal combustion engines , and General Motors , Toyota and Mercedes - Benz are among the automakers also developing fuel cell vehicles .
Mazda 's arrived at the party pretty early , developing its first hydrogen rotary engine in 1991 and a hydrogen - powered MX - 5 Miata two years later .
More recently , it 's been working on an H2 - powered version of the highly enjoyable RX - 8 and has been winter testing the vehicle .
Now , it has joined the Norwegian government have upped the ante considerably .
Mazda 's first Mazda RX - 8 Hydrogen RE vehicle was developed specifically for participation in HyNor , Norway 's national hydrogen project .
HyNor will establish a network of hydrogen filling stations along a 360 - mile stretch of highway between Stavanger and Oslo .
Mazda and HyNor began their collaboration on the project in November 2007 and started validation of the RX - 8 Hydrogen RE 's driving performance on Norwegian public roads in October .
The first RX - 8 Hydrogen RE will make its public debut May 11 at the official opening of HyNor 's hydrogen filling stations .
The car will undergo certification to meet local standards , and Mazda plans to start leasing the cars in Norway this summer .

About a year ago , I had become determined to collect every bottle cap from every drink that was consumed at my apartment .
The idea of this was to someday use these caps to construct the top of a coffee table that would live on for all of eternity .
Almost 12 months have gone by and almost 1500 bottle caps had been amassed , and a few weeks ago I finally built it .
I wanted to make a fun , easily recognizable design , so I went with a pixel - for - pixel reconstruction of a sprite for Super Mario World :
The interesting thing is that since you ca n’t make much sense of clusters of pixels from close up , many guests are unable to see Mario until they look at the table from a distance .
This was a hyperambitious project , but I still have plenty of leftover caps and would certainly not be opposed to making another piece of cap - art in the near future .

One Billion People Around the World Suffer from Hunger
Added by viorel on Jun 25 , 2009 | Visited by 4467 | Voted by 51 persons
According to UN today there are one billion people across the world that suffer from hunger .
Due to the global financial crisis the number increased by 100 million .
Experts at UN \'s Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) say that the figure reached a record high mark .
An increase in the number of people suffering from hunger was also generated by continuously increasing prices for food .
Over 15 percent of the world \'s population poses a risk to peace and security on the globe .
The statement comes from the general director of FAO .
Developing countries house the largest number of the world \'s undernourished , with Asia - Pacific region being number one in the list with 642 million people .
The second comes the sub-Saharan Africa , where there are 265 million people starving .
The developed countries leave about 15 million hungry .
\ " We urgently need to forge a broad consensus on the total and rapid eradication of hunger in the world and to take the necessary actions , \ " said Jacques Diouf .
The UN agency stated that today more people suffer from hunger due to lower incomes and a continuously rising rate of unemployment , which considerably reduces people \'s access to food and clean water .
At the same time , with a drastic increase in the number of poor people , most of the developed world becomes wealthier than ever before .
While the number of hungry people reached the highest point in human history , a lot of countries become much richer in spite of the financial crisis , said FAO spokesman Kostas Stamoulis , who holds the position of director of the organization \'s development department .
The contradiction here is clear .
Mr. Diouf believes it is important for the governments to support the development of agriculture , especially to provide economic assistance to smallholder farmers .
It is worth mentioning that the majority of developing countries have a poor agricultural sector , which is the most important field for these countries to explore in order to deal with poverty and hunger .
In addition , agricultural sector could drive the world \'s economic growth .
According to the UK \'s international development ministry ( Dfid ) the numbers were \ " a scandal\ " .
The ministry also mentioned that it was providing help to some of the world \'s poorest farmers in order to increase the amount of food they grow .
The biggest problems will surround poor people living in cities , where the global economic crisis led to an increased rate of unemployment , with millions of people losing their jobs .
The crisis also led to a decrease in the export demand and cuts in foreign investment .
The majority of migrants will most likely switch from cities to rural areas .
The incomes registered a significant drop in the developing countries that depend on remittances coming from relatives who work abroad .
There is just not enough space for developing countries today , with the crisis affecting all parts of the world .
Although the prices in the world markets are plunging , food costs in developing countries are even more expensive .
\ " For poor consumers , who spend up to 60 percent of their incomes on staple foods , this means a strong reduction in their effective purchasing power , \ " the FAO said .
Diplomatic tensions have sparked recently between Israel and Brazil over none other than a soccer match , Yedioth Ahronoth reported Wednesday .
The Brazilian government decided to extend a gesture to the Palestinian people and hold a friendly game between two of its leading soccer teams – Sao Paulo 's Corinthians and Rio de Janeiro 's Flamengo – in the West Bank city of Ramallah .
With famed player Ronaldo as the Corinthians ' striker and Flamengo being one of the world 's top soccer teams , many Israelis would undoubtedly love to attend the game , but the Brazilians have made it clear that they are not interested in playing in Israel – only in the Palestinian Authority .
Giora Bachar , the Israeli ambassador to Brasilia inquired about the reports in the local media with the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , which confirmed them .
Bachar filed an official protest with the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , but his report to Jerusalem did indicate that the initiative has yet to find a sponsor .
" I intend to make the Brazilians understand that if a similar game is not held in Israel , we will see it as an act of ostracism , " he said .
" It would be better off if they held two games , or better still – a joint game for the Israelis and Palestinians . "

FAQ for alt.books.isaac-asimov
This document answers frequently asked questions about Isaac Asimov and his works .

For a German translation of this FAQ , see Bálint Krizsán 's site .
Table of Contents :
Just how many books did Asimov write ?
An awful lot .
Hundreds .
Long answer :
Well , it depends on how you count them .
For example , the most complete Asimov bibliography which Asimov himself had a hand in preparing is the catalogue in I.
Asimov : A Memoir .
It lists 469 items , including 2 wall posters and a calendar ( which some people might not be inclined to count as " books " . )
It also lists 117 science fiction anthologies , none of which are entirely by Asimov , and many of which include no stories by him ( and so some people might be inclined not to count those . )
There are also books which were almost entirely written by someone else ( the Superquiz books , From Harding to Hiroshima , the Book of Facts ) which Asimov counted because he had an extensive role in the editing of the book .
Some books were counted more than once if Asimov did extensive work on later editions ( such as the Biographical Encyclopedia . )
And , of course , Asimov recycled many of his stories and essays so that they appeared in more than one collection , and some books are nothing but recyclings of older books .
On the other hand , the catalogue in I. Asimov : A Memoir is not complete .
Near the end of his life , Asimov 's ill health kept him from keeping careful track himself of all the books he published , and so some books were left out of the catalogue .
Some books , of course , were published after I. Asimov : A Memoir and so are not listed there .
Ed Seiler 's list of books includes numerous titles missing from the catalogue in I.
Asimov : A Memoir , and ends up with a count of somewhat over 500 .
And then there are books like Harlan Ellison 's I , Robot : The Illustrated Screenplay .
It is based on Asimov 's work , and both Asimov 's and Ellison 's name are listed on the title page , but the actual work on the screenplay is virtually all Ellison's .
It was published in book form after Asimov 's death , which makes it difficult to know if Asimov himself would have counted it .
Does it count as an " Asimov " book ?
So about the only definitive answer that can be provided at this point is :
An awful lot .
Hundreds .
Where can I get a list of all of Asimov 's books ?
Is there a WWW or FTP site for this information ?
Opus 100
Opus 200
Opus 300
In Memory Yet Green
In Joy Still Felt
I. Asimov : A Memoir
It 's Been a Good Life
The lists in Opus 100 , Opus 200 , Opus 300 , In Memory Yet Green , and In Joy Still Felt include an official number for each of the books listed , indicating the order of publication .
The catalogue in I. Asimov : A Memoir does not provide numbers for the books listed there , and is known to be incomplete .
( It also has a number of typographical errors .
The list in the first edition of It 's Been a Good Life suffers from the same problems . )
However , Asimov 's personal records show that he did assign numbers to books 301 through 468 .
Official numbers for those books published towards the end of his life , and those published after his death , are not available .
Many of the books published after his 468th can be found by going through such sources as Books In Print or the Library of Congress online catalog .
However , since Asimov often did not count as " his " books those on which a publisher merely slapped his name , these sources cannot be taken as complete .
The compilation of a truly complete list is not a casual undertaking .
The web pages available are :
Where can I download Asimov 's fiction on the net ?
As a result , none of Asimov 's fiction is legally available for free download on the net without the permission of his estate .
A number of Asimov 's books and stories are available for purchase in popular e-book formats , such as Kindle editions at amazon.com , epub editions at the iTunes store and eBooks.com , Nook Books at Barnes & Noble .
Where else can I find Asimov stuff on the net ?
Who can I contact regarding rights and permissions for works by Isaac Asimov ?
All other inquires should be directed to Gary Wishik , Esq at
How do you pronounce " Isaac Asimov " ?
The Flying Sorcerers
" The Prime of Life "
Asimov's own suggestion , however , as to how to remember his name was to say " Has Him Of " and leave out the H's .
It 's Been a Good Life
When and where was he born ?
Asimov 's birthdate was temporarily changed by his mother to September 7 , 1919 in order to get him into school a year earlier .
When , several years later , he discovered this , he insisted that the official records be changed back .
January 2 , 1920 was the date he personally celebrated throughout his life .
His family left the Soviet Union on January 11 , 1923 and arrived in New York City February 3 .
Please note that the date given on the first page of Asimov 's third autobiographical book , I. Asimov : A Memoir , is a typographical error ( January 1 , 1920 ) .
Asimov's other books leave no possible doubt that the date he celebrated as his birthday was January 2 .
Who are the other members of his family ?
His father saved the money earned from several jobs during his first three years in the U.S. and bought a candy store in Brooklyn , which his parents ran for the next forty or so years .
Marcia married Nicholas Repanes in 1955 and has two sons , Larry and Richard .
Stan became a journalist and rose to vice president in charge of editorial administration for Newsday .
Stan died of leukemia on August 16 , 1995 .
He and his wife Ruth were the parents of Eric and Nanette , both journalists , and Daniel , a mathematician .
Dan Asimov may be found on the net , but does not wish to be bothered with inquiries about Isaac , so please leave him alone .
Was he married ?
Did he have any children ?
Isaac first met Janet Opal Jeppson when he signed an autograph for her at an SF convention on September 2 , 1956 .
He was suffering badly ( and silently ) from a kidney stone at the time , which gave her the impression that he was an unpleasant person .
He later claimed to have absolutely no recollection of that first meeting .
They next met on May 1 , 1959 , when Janet attended a mystery writers ' banquet as a guest of Veronica Parker Johnson and was seated with Isaac .
That time the mutual attraction was immediate .
When Isaac and Gertrude finally separated in 1970 , he moved in with Janet almost at once , and they were married at Janet 's home by an official of the Ethical Culture Society on November 30 , 1973 .
Asimov had no children by his second marriage .
Where did Asimov live , attend school , and work during his life ?
In May of 1942 , Asimov left New York to work at a wartime job at the Philadelphia Naval Yard , and there he rented a room in someone else 's house at 4707 Sansom Street , until September , when soon after getting married he and Gertrude moved into an apartment at 4715 Walnut Street .
When the lease ran out they moved to another apartment in Philadelphia at Wingate Hall in December .
They moved back to New York in September 1945 , and in November he was inducted into the army .
In the army he spent a week at Fort Meade , Md. , and was then stationed at Camp Lee , Virginia until March of 1946 , when he was transferred to the island of Oahu .
He returned to the states in May , and after his discharge from the army in July , he and Gertrude moved into a small apartment in Brooklyn on 213 Dean Street in September 1946 .
In September of 1947 they moved to the downstairs apartment of his parents ' house on Windsor Place , and in July of the next year moved to Apartment 9 - C of the Stuyvesant Town complex on 273 First Avenue .
They moved to Boston in May 1949 to an apartment at 42 Worcester Square , and quickly moved again in July to an apartment in the suburb of Somerville .
In May 1951 they moved to an apartment at 265 Lowell Street , in Waltham , Mass .
They moved two miles to the south to a house at 45 Greenough Street in West Newton , Mass. in March 1956 .
In July 1970 , he separated from his wife and moved back to New York , staying at the Oliver Cromwell Hotel .
After his divorce from Gertrude in November 1973 , he married Janet and moved into her apartment .
They moved to the Park Ten apartments in April 1975 , to a 33rd floor apartment overlooking Central Park , where they lived together until his death in 1992 .
Asimov began his formal education in the New York Public School system in 1925 at PS182 , and transferred to PS202 when the family moved in 1928 .
He continued on to East New York Junior High School 149 in September 1930 , where he was placed in the rapid advance course , and graduated in June 1932 .
He entered tenth grade at Boys High School in the fall , and graduated in the spring of 1935 .
After attending City College for only a few days , he switched to the Brooklyn campus of Seth Low Junior College , which provided him with a scholarship of one hundred dollars .
The college closed after his freshman year , so he continued at the parent institution , Columbia University , at the Morningside Heights campus .
He graduated from Columbia with a B.S. in Chemistry in 1939 .
After his applications to all five New York City medical schools were rejected , he applied for the master 's program in chemistry at Columbia .
After he was rejected for the master 's program , he convinced the department committee to accept him on probation .
After one year the probation was lifted , and he earned his M.A. in Chemistry in 1941 .
He continued on at Columbia in a Ph.D. program , and after the gap in his research that lasted from 1942 through 1946 ( due to his wartime job and his army ) , he earned his Ph.D. in Chemistry in May 1948 .
Asimov started working in his parents '
Essex Street candy store in 1929 , when his mother became unable to work a full day due to her third pregnancy , and learned the steady work habits that would stay with him for the rest of his life .
After his freshman year of college , he had a summer job at the Columbia Combining Company , where he cut and folded sheets of rubberized fabric .
During his sophomore year he held a National Youth Administration job working for a psychology professor , and as a junior and senior his NYA job was as a typist for a sociology professor .
Throughout the period of 1929 to 1942 , he continued to work at the family candy store .
He worked as a junior chemist at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from May 1942 to October 1945 , together with fellow science fiction authors Robert Heinlein and L. Sprague de Camp .
In 1948 he obtained a postdoctoral position at Columbia , researching antimalarial compounds .
In June of 1949 he took a job as instructor of biochemistry at the Boston University School of Medicine , and was promoted to assistant professor in December 1951 .
He was promoted to associate professor , which provided him with tenure , in July 1955 .
He gave up his teaching duties and salary at the School of Medicine in 1958 , but retained his title , so that on July 1 , 1958 , he became a full - time writer .
( He was fired , he said , for choosing to be an excellent lecturer and science writer , rather than be a merely mediocre researcher . )
In 1979 , the school promoted him to the rank of full professor .
What are the titles of Asimov 's autobiographies ?
Where can I get them ?
In Memory Yet Green
In Joy Still Felt
I. Asimov : A Memoir was published by Doubleday in March 1994 , and covers his entire life , written in 166 brief chapters arranged in roughly chronological order .
Instead of writing only about the details of his life since 1978 , at the request of his wife Janet he wrote a retrospective that provided insights into his thoughts , feelings , and way of thinking .
Yours , Isaac Asimov , a collection of excerpts from letters he had written over the years , edited by his brother Stan and published by Doubleday in October 1995 , also provides a great insight into Asimov 's personal and professional life .
It 's Been a Good Life , a condensed version of his autobiographical volumes that also includes additional material , was edited by Janet Jeppson Asimov and published by Prometheus Books in 2002 .
The additional material includes " A Way of Thinking " , Asimov 's 400th essay for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction , which Janet put together from conversations they had and letters they had exchanged during many years of correspondence .
More excerpts from those letters , chosen to illustrate Isaac 's philosophy of life , are sprinkled throughout the book .
It also features an expanded version of the epilogue that appeared in Yours , Isaac Asimov , which provides additional commentary about Isaac 's final illness .
In addition , the three Opus books ( Opus 100 , Opus 200 , and Opus300 ) , The Early Asimov , and Before the Golden Age contain substantial autobiographical material , and Asimov talks a great deal about himself and his life in many of his other books , particularly in anecdotes found in his essays in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and his editorials in Isaac Asimov 's Science Fiction Magazine ( which has since been renamed Asimov 's Science Fiction ) .
What books and articles about Asimov have been written by others ?
What religious beliefs did Asimov have ?
Asimov did not oppose genuine religious feeling in others .
He did , however , have little patience for intolerance or superstition masquerading as religion .
Although he was an atheist , Asimov was proud of his Jewish heritage .
His parents never made an effort to teach him religion .
He did study in Hebrew school for several months while his father served as secretary for the local synagogue , where he learned some Hebrew and how to read Yiddish .
Asimov did have a great interest in the Bible , and wrote several books about it , notably the two volume Asimov 's Guide to the Bible and The Story of Ruth .
Did Asimov do anything other than write all day and all night ?
He was a member of the Dutch Treat Club , a group that met for lunch every Tuesday at the Regency Hotel in New York .
He joined the club in 1971 and was made president in 1985 .
He joined the Baker Street Irregulars in 1973 , a group of avid Sherlock Holmes fans that held an annual banquet to celebrate Holmes ' birthday .
Asimov admitted that he was not a true Holmes enthusiast , but enjoyed delivering banquet toasts , speeches , and singing sentimental songs .
Asimov was a Gilbert & Sullivan enthusiast since his youth , when he listened to the plays on the radio .
In 1970 he joined the Gilbert and Sullivan Society , and attended almost all of their meetings .
He regularly attended G & S productions in Manhattan , and occasionally served as toastmaster at benefit shows .
He loved to sing songs from the shows , and was quite proud of his singing voice ( among other things ) .
He was also a P. G. Wodehouse fan , and a member of The Wodehouse Society .
He acknowledged that the character of Henry , the waiter who played a central role in his Black Widower stories , was based on Wodehouse 's Jeeves the butler .
He also paid tribute to the influence of Wodehouse in his Azazel short stories .
He belonged to an all - male club called the Trap Door Spiders , which met for dinner one Friday night every month , treating a guest invited by the host to dinner in return for the privilege of grilling him about his life and work .
The club formed the basis for the Black Widower mystery short stories .
The characters were loosely modeled on actual club members as follows :
Black Widower Trap Door Spider =============
================
Geoffrey Avalon L. Sprague de Camp Emmanuel Rubin Lester del Rey James Drake Doc Clark Thomas Trumball Gilbert Cant Mario Gonzalo Lin Carter Roger Halsted Don Bensen
Henry fictional
Asimov was a member of the Explorers Club , and served as master of ceremonies for two years at their annual banquet .
Is it true that Asimov had a fear of flying ?
Asimov discovered that he was acrophobic at the New York World 's Fair in 1940 , when he took his date and first love Irene on a roller coaster , expecting that it would cause her to cling to him in fear and give him a chance to kiss her .
Instead it was he who was terrified while his date remained perfectly calm .
Two years later , his wife - to - be Gertrude convinced him to ride on a roller coaster at Coney Island , and he was once again terrified .
Asimov did in fact fly on an airplane twice in his life .
The first time he did so while working at the Naval Air Experimental Station in Philadelphia during World War II .
While working on dye markers that made ditched pilots more visible to rescue searchers , he developed a test to compare dye visibility that did not require a plane flight , but in order to validate his test he volunteered to fly in a small plane to observe the markers .
He was so absorbed in his observations that he did n't suffer from any undue fear .
His second plane flight took place on his return from his army station in Hawaii , in which he flew aboard a DC - 3 to San Francisco .
After his military service in Hawaii in 1946 , Asimov never ventured so far from home , and did not often travel great distances .
When he did need to travel significant distances , he usually took a train , or rode in someone else 's car , until he learned to drive in 1950 .
Oddly enough , he found that he felt quite comfortable behind the wheel of an automobile .
In the 1970s he and Janet travelled by train to Florida and California , and they took several several sea cruises to such places as the Caribbean , West Africa , England , and France .
What other notable quirks , fears , and pet peeves did Asimov have ?
He was completely inept at any athletic activity that required any coordination ; he never learned how to swim or ride a bicycle .
Spending even ten minutes in the summer sun turned his skin a bright red .
In the army he had the worst score in his company on the physical - conditioning test ( though he had the highest score on the intelligence test ) .
He was afraid of needles and the sight of blood .
Asimov discovered that he was claustrophiliac , meaning that he was fond of enclosed places .
He was quite comfortable in small rooms with no windows , and always insisted on using artificial lighting when he worked .
He considered the underground cities on Earth in The Caves of Steel as the ultimate windowless enclosures .
He did not allow anyone to call him by any nicknames , except for a few old friends who had been calling him Ike for years .
Asimov hated it when his name was misspelled in print or mispronounced by others .
His desire to have his name spelled correctly even resulted in a 1957 short story , " Spell my Name with an 's ' " .
( Notable instances of his name being misspelled occurred on the cover of the November 1952 issue of Galaxy , which contained " The Martian Way " , and on his 1976 Nebula Award for " The Bicentennial Man " . )
When in 1940 he wrote a letter to Planet Stories , which printed it and spelled his name " Isaac Asenion " , he quickly fired off an angry letter to them .
( His friend Lester Del Rey took great delight in referring to him as " Asenion " for many years afterward .
On the other hand , Asimov himself referred to positronic robots with the Three Laws as " Asenion " robots in The Caves of Steel . )
Asimov was quite perturbed when Johnny Carson , host of the Tonight Show , pronounced his first name as I - ZAK , with equal emphasis on both syllables , during an appearance on the television show in New York in 1968 .
When did he start writing ?
The Greenville Chums at College
Asimov 's first published writing was a column he did for his high school newspaper .
His first accepted piece was a humorous essay entitled " Little Brothers " , which appeared in The Boys High Recorder , his high school 's semi-annual literary publication , in 1934 , and is reprinted in Before the Golden Age .
He wrote it in a creative writing class he took that year ; a class which almost convinced him to give up writing .
What was his first published story ?
Astounding Science Fiction
Amazing Stories

Asimov Laughs Again ( the last book he saw published before his death , published in 1992 )
( the last book he saw published before his death , published in 1992 ) Forward the Foundation ( his last Foundation novel , published in 1993 )
( his last Foundation novel , published in 1993 ) Frontiers II ( his last -- to date -- essay collection , published in 1993 )

( his last -- to date -- anthology of science fiction stories , published in 1995 ) Magic ( his last -- to date -- anthology of fantasy stories , published in 1996 )
All this , however , does not preclude the possibility of more books by Asimov being published in the future .
There are , for example , enough uncollected F&SF science essays for one more collection .
Additional volumes could be published in the " Complete Stories " series , as well as other anthologies ( e.g. , " The Honest - to - goodness Complete Robot Stories Book " ) .
All we can say for certain is that with his death , Asimov appears to have stopped writing .
He has , by no means , stopped publishing .
It is therefore probably meaningless to refer to Asimov 's " last " book in absolute chronological terms .
Of his own work , what were Asimov 's favorite and least favorite novels ?
What were his favorite and least favorite stories ?
The Gods Themselves
His least favorite novel was The Stars Like Dust .
It was scheduled for serialization in Galaxy , then edited by Horace Gold .
Gold absolutely insisted on including a subplot about the characters ransacking the Galaxy for an ancient document which would utterly revolutionize their political order .
In the end , it turns out that the document is " gur Pbafgvghgvba bs gur Havgrq Fgngrf " ( rot - 13 coding added as spoiler protection , as if this sub - par novel could be truly " spoiled " by giving away plot points ) .
Asimov loathed the subplot and bitterly resented being forced to add it .
He offered to his editor at Doubleday , Walter Bradbury , to remove it for the hardcover publication , but Bradbury liked the subplot and insisted it be left in .
Then to add insult to injury , when the first paperback edition was published by Ace , they changed the title ( for the worse ) and totally gutted the novel , to the point that Asimov could hardly recognize it .
Asimov's three favorite stories were ( in order ) : " The Last Question " , " The Bicentennial Man " , and " The Ugly Little Boy " ( all found in The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov , among other places ) .
Among his least favorite stories were :
" Black Friar of the Flame " ( found in The Early Asimov ) .
The story was his first attempt at a " future historical " and was bounced around from editor to editor until it was finally published .
It was revised a half - a - dozen times and rejected ten times in a two - year - period .
Asimov was so bitter over the story 's history that he swore never again to revise anything more than twice , and he would even fight over having to do a second revision .
( This is his least favorite story among those that most Asimov fans are likely to have ever read .
He also implies in The Early Asimov that it is his least favorite story of all time , but this is clarified in In Joy Still Felt . )
His all - time least favorite story was " The Portable Star " ( Thrilling Wonder Stories , Winter 1955 ) .
He disliked it so much , he never authorized its anthologization .
He describes it as a sleazy attempt to cash in on the new interest in sex in sf started by Philip Jose Farmer 's 1952 story , " The Lovers . "
He also published a story , " A Woman 's Heart " in the June 1957 Satellite which he considered so trivial that he never included it in any of his collections .
Forward the Foundation
Did Asimov really write Forward the Foundation ?
Did n't he die before it was done , so somebody else really wrote it up from notes ?
Forward the Foundation
Forward the Foundation was originally planned to be a series of novellas , bridging the chronological gap between Prelude to Foundation and Foundation .
The first three were completed long before Asimov died and published in Isaac Asimov 's Science Fiction Magazine .
Asimov had completed draft material for the remainder of the book before his death .
This material required some editing by Doubleday and Asimov 's widow , Janet , before the book was published , but even Asimov was rarely published with no editing at all , and there was no significant expansion of incomplete sections done .
The final result is correctly characterized as being " by Isaac Asimov . "
What about the contradictions between Forward the Foundation and other Foundation books ?
First of all , Asimov simply did n't enjoy sweating over details in his fiction .
There are a number of things Asimov enjoyed about writing -- that 's why he wrote so much -- but purging his fiction of contradictions was not one of them .
As early as 1945 , he was finding it more effort than it was worth to keep up consistency in the Foundation stories and tried ( three times ) to end the series so that he would n't have to deal with it .
Secondly , Asimov 's overall plan for the series changed .
For example , the robot stories and Foundation stories were originally conceived as existing in separate fictional universes .
It was n't until the 1980s that he started to tie them together explicitly .
Other examples would involve major spoilers for some of the later books .
( Also , the stories were written over the course of fifty years , starting from a time when Asimov was at the unspectacular beginning of his career and the Golden Age was a year old , to a time when Asimov was one of science fiction 's Big Three and John Campbell , for whom the earliest stories were written , dead for twenty years .
It should not be surprising that the seventy - year - old Grand Master should find some of the ideas of the twenty - year - old apprentice not quite up to snuff and not worth preserving . )
Is it true that a new Foundation Series written by three different authors was published ?
How could the publisher be allowed to do such a thing ?
Foundation 's Fear
Foundation and Chaos
Foundation 's Triumph
Foundation 's Fear
The novels were written at the suggestion of Janet Asimov and the representative of the Asimov estate .
They approached Gregory Benford and asked him to write a Foundation book .
After giving it some thought , he agreed to do so , and suggested that Bear and Brin write additional books to form a new trilogy .
What is the chronological order of the Foundation books ?
Prelude to Foundation
" In any case , the situation has become sufficiently complicated for me to feel that the readers might welcome a kind of guide to the series , since they were not written in the order in which ( perhaps ) they should be read .
" The fourteen books , all published by Doubleday , offer a kind of history of the future , which is , perhaps , not completely consistent , since I did not plan consistency to begin with .
The chronological order of the books , in terms of future history ( and not of publication date ) , is as follows : " 1 . The Complete Robot ( 1982 ) .
This is a collection of thirty - one robot short stories published between 1940 and 1976 and includes every story in my earlier collection , I , Robot ( 1950 ) .
Only one robot short story has been written since that collection appeared .
That is Robot Dreams , which has not yet appeared in any Doubleday collection .
[ Robot Dreams ( 1986 ) does contain it ; see also Robot Visions ( 1990 ) ] " 2 . The Caves of Steel ( 1954 ) .
This is the first of my robot novels .
" 3 . The Naked Sun ( 1957 ) .
The second robot novel .
" 4 . The Robots of Dawn ( 1983 ) .
The third robot novel .
" 5 . Robots and Empire ( 1985 ) .
The fourth robot novel .
" 6 . The Currents of Space ( 1952 ) .
This is the first of my Empire novels .
" 7 . The Stars , Like Dust -- ( 1951 ) .
The second Empire novel .
" 8 . Pebble in the Sky ( 1950 ) .
The third Empire novel .
" 9 . Prelude to Foundation ( 1988 ) .
This is the first Foundation novel ( although it is the latest written , so far ) . [ 9 a .
Forward the Foundation ( 1993 ) . ] [ 9b. Foundation 's Fear ( 1997 ) . ]
The first novel in the Second Foundation Trilogy , it was written by Gregory Benford .
Takes place after the first chapter of Forward the Foundation . [ 9 c. Foundation and Chaos ( 1998 ) . ]
The second novel in the Second Foundation Trilogy , written by Greg Bear .
Takes place at the approximate time of Hari Seldon 's trial .
[ 9d .
Foundation 's Triumph ( previously titled Third Foundation and Secret Foundation ) ( 1999 ) . ]
The third novel in the Second Foundation Trilogy , written by David Brin .
" 10 . Foundation ( 1951 ) .
The second Foundation novel .
Actually , it is a collection of four stories , originally published between 1942 and 1944 , plus an introductory section written for the book in 1949 .
" 11 . Foundation and Empire ( 1952 ) .
The third Foundation novel , made up of two stories , originally published in 1945 .
" 12 . Second Foundation ( 1953 ) .
The fourth Foundation novel , made up of two stories , originally published in 1948 and 1949 .
" 13 .
Foundation 's Edge ( 1982 ) .
The fifth Foundation novel .
" 14 . Foundation and Earth ( 1983 ) .
The sixth Foundation novel . "
Currents of Space
The Stars , Like Dust
Foundation and Earth
What is the order in which the Foundation books should be read ?
A ) Read them in the order of action , as listed by Asimov .
B ) Read them in the order of publication .
There is no real reason why ( A ) or ( B ) is the better order .
If you 're more interested in seeing the development of Asimov 's universe , writing , and ideas , you may prefer ( B ) .
If you are more interested in the course of events in Asimov 's universe , you may prefer ( A ) .
Note , also , that some of the more recent books contain spoilers for some of the earlier ones , so the impact of some stories may be lessened if you choose ( A ) .
Note that Asimov in the Author 's Note quoted does not actually suggest one order over the other , but does suggest chronological order as a possibility .
C ) Just read the ones published in the 1950s ( plus The Complete Robot ) because the later ones all suck .
No true Asimov fan , of course , would agree that any of the Good Doctor 's books " suck , " but there is pretty broad feeling that the later books are not as good as the earlier ones .
( There is also pretty broad disagreement with this assessment . )
In particular , Foundation and Earth is considered one of the weaker books in the series .
Of course , your mileage will vary , and you may be one of those who prefers the later books over the earlier ones .
Foundation and Earth ?
What book is that ?
Why can't I find it on sale in a bookstore ?
Foundation and Earth
Foundation and Earth
Whatever happened to the Solarians , who mysteriously disappeared in Robots and Empire ?
Foundation and Earth
What is the significance of the ending of Foundation and Earth ?
Foundation and Earth
Asimov fully intended to write a sequel to Foundation and Earth , continuing the story chronologically .
He had , however , no specific plans for how he would develop the problem with which Foundation and Earth ends , let alone how to resolve it .
His next ( and final ) two Foundation books were stories of the life of Hari Seldon , written largely because he could n't figure out what would happen after Foundation and Earth .
He died before he had any specific plans for what would happen next .
Why do Asimov 's books give two reasons why the Earth becomes radioactive ?
Pebble In the Sky
The Stars , Like Dust
The Currents of Space
Later on , Asimov realized that this explanation would n't wash .
The effects he described would not be possible as the result of a nuclear war .
He therefore provides a different explanation in Robots and Empire and Foundation and Earth .
Within the fictional universe , the explanation is that the characters in the three Empire novels thought that the Earth became radioactive as a result of a nuclear war , but that they were wrong .
Did Asimov write the Foundation books with any plan in mind ?
Asimov 's original intention was to write a series of longer stories to complement the series of short stories he was writing about robots .
He started the Foundation series as a saga of the collapse of the First Galactic Empire and rise of the Second , using Edward Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as a model .
It was n't long before he got bored with the series .
Since the Foundation 's ultimate success was guaranteed by psychohistory , there was a considerable lack of dramatic tension , and it was hard keeping the stories from contradicting each other .
He therefore wrote " Now You See It -- " as a way to end the series , but John Campbell , the editor of Astounding , would have none of it and insisted that Asimov alter the ending so that the series could continue .
By the time he wrote the next Foundation story , " -- And Now You Don't , " Asimov had come to hate the series so much that Campbell did n't even attempt to convince him to continue .
( Ironically , " -- And Now You Don't " is among the strongest stories in the series . )
Over the course of the writing of the original Foundation stories , the focus shifted slightly .
The " tiny bit of cribbin ' from the works of Edward Gibbon " faded into the background .
Mentalics were introduced at Campbell 's insistence as a means of throwing a monkey wrench into the Plan with " The Mule " -- superhumans with psychic powers were a favorite theme of Campbell's .
The existence of the Second Foundation had been a part of the series from the beginning , as was its location at " Star 's End , " but its exact nature was n't clearly defined until it acquired its role as the Mule 's nemesis .
With these last two stories written , he considered himself forever finished with the Foundation series , even though there were still over 500 years of the Plan to run .
They would simply be century upon century of the Foundation 's growth and triumph under the direction of the Second Foundation , and really rather dull .
Asimov did write one more Foundation story to open Foundation , and nothing more for over thirty years .
In the 1980s , Asimov was persuaded by Doubleday to write a new Foundation book .
The result was Foundation 's Edge .
Again , he decided to create a more interesting story by making up a new threat to the Seldon Plan .
Foundation 's Edge was so successful that Asimov was persuaded to finally write the third Elijah Baley novel , The Robots of Dawn , which created the first ( implicit ) connection between the Foundation and Robot books .
This connection , which was not anticipated when Asimov started writing robot and Foundation stories in the 1940s , was finally made explicit in the next two books written , Robots and Empire and Foundation and Earth .
Finally , because he was n't sure what to do next , Asimov wrote Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation to tell the story of Hari Seldon 's life and the beginnings of psychohistory .
Is Data from Star Trek : The Next Generation an Asimovian robot ?
Star Trek : The Next Generation
Asimov's key insight was that , inasmuch as we engineer our tools to be safe to use , we would do the same with robots once we start making them -- and that the main safeguards for an intelligent being are its ethics .
We would , therefore , build ethics into our robots to keep them going off on uncontrollable killing sprees .
In some sense , the specific Three ( Four ) Laws are themselves an engineering detail , the robotic equivalent of the Ten Commandments -- it is a specific ethical system but not the only one possible .
In Asimov 's universe , they are the basis for robotic ethics and so absolutely fundamental to robotic design that it is virtually impossible to build a robot without them .
Asimov tended not to let other people use his specific Laws of Robotics , but his essential insight -- that robots will have in - built ethical systems -- is freely used .
In particular , Data is an " Asimovian " robot because he does have an in - built ethical system .
He does not have the Three Laws , however ( witness the episode " The Measure of a Man " in which he refuses to follow a direct order from a superior officer [ Second Law ] without invoking either danger to a specific human [ First Law ] or the higher needs of all of humanity [ Zeroth Law ] ) .
Moreover , his ethical programming is not fundamental to his design ( his prototype , Lore , lacks it altogether , and Data 's ethical program is turned off for much of " Descent , part II " ) .
Asimov stated that Roddenberry asked for his permission to make Data a positronic robot after the fact .
Asimov himself had no input into the character .
There were plans to have Asimov appear on the show as a holodeck simulation and talk to Data ( just as Stephen Hawking did ) .
A combination of Asimov 's location and ill - health made this impossible .
What are the Laws of Robotics , anyway ?
1 . A robot may not injure a human being , or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm .
2 . A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
3 . A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law .
From Handbook of Robotics , 56th Edition , 2058 A.D. , as quoted in I , Robot .
In Robots and Empire ( ch. 63 ) , the " Zeroth Law " is extrapolated , and the other Three Laws modified accordingly : 0 . A robot may not injure humanity or , through inaction , allow humanity to come to harm .
Unlike the Three Laws , however , the Zeroth Law is not a fundamental part of positronic robotic engineering , is not part of all positronic robots , and , in fact , requires a very sophisticated robot to even accept it .
Asimov claimed that the Three Laws were originated by John W. Campbell in a conversation they had on December 23 , 1940 .
Campbell in turn maintained that he picked them out of Asimov 's stories and discussions , and that his role was merely to state them explicitly .
The Three Laws did not appear in Asimov 's first two robot stories , " Robbie " and " Reason " , but the First Law was stated in Asimov 's third robot story " Liar ! " , which also featured the first appearance of robopsychologist Susan Calvin .
( When " Robbie " and " Reason " were included in I , Robot , they were updated to mention the existence of the first law and first two laws , respectively .
" Robbie " was also updated to include a cameo appearance by Susan Calvin . )
Yet there was a hint of the three laws in " Robbie " , in which Robbie 's owner states that " He can't help being faithful , loving , and kind .
He 's a machine - made so . "
The first story to explicitly state the Three Laws was " Runaround " , which appeared in the March 1942 issue of Astounding Science Fiction .
What is the relationship between the movie Fantastic Voyage and Asimov 's novel ?
Asimov was never satisfied with Fantastic Voyage , and he never thought of it as " his " work .
Later , a person who had bought the rights to the title and concept ( but not the characters or situation ) of the original was interested in making Fantastic Voyage II .
Naturally he turned to Asimov , who at first refused .
At some point , Asimov agreed , but insisted on handling his side as a pure book deal with Doubleday .
Consequently , Asimov 's book Fantastic Voyage II should not be considered a sequel to the original .
What did Asimov write besides the Foundation and Robot books ?
Following is a list of some of Asimov 's better - known or more influential works .
The list is purely subjective , based on the personal preference of the FAQ - keepers .
There is much which is worthwhile but not listed .

Is there an index of his science articles for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction ( F&SF ) ?
Of his editorials in Isaac Asimov 's Science Fiction Magazine ( IASFM ) ?
The Road to Infinity
Of the 174 editorials published in IASFM , dealing mainly with Asimov 's thoughts on Science Fiction , 22 were included in Asimov on Science Fiction , 66 in Asimov 's Galaxy , 10 in Gold , and 3 in Magic , but he did not compile an index to these .
( Gold also reprinted 3 of the IASFM essays that appeared in Asimov on Science Fiction and 19 of the essays that appeared in Asimov 's Galaxy , and Magic reprinted 2 of the IASFM essays from Asimov on Science Fiction and 3 from Asimov 's Galaxy ) .
Asimov also wrote numerous other essays that were published in other magazines , many of which have appeared in other essay collections .
Seeing the need for a single index to all of Asimov 's essays , Rich Hatcher and Ed Seiler valiantly decided to compile one , and after many months of work , it was completed .
Their guide lists over 1600 essays , including the subject of the essay , the publication in which the essay first appeared , and a list of Asimov 's collections in which the essay appeared .
Indexes list the essays chronologically for each major series ( e.g. the science essays in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction ) , and also group the essays by subject , in order to help you find any essay Asimov wrote on any given subject .

It is also found in a number of anthologies not consisting entirely of stories by Asimov .
There is a mathematical possibility that you 're thinking of a story other than " The Last Question " , but it 's very slight .
Asimov's own experience was that if someone could n't remember the title of one of his stories ( and especially if they were n't entirely sure if it was by him ) , then it was " The Last Question . "
But just in case , here are some of the stories with titles that often are n't remembered as well as the plot :
" The Last Question " concerns the fate of the universe , when a computer is asked several times through the ages if entropy can ever be reversed .
" The Feeling of Power " describes a time in the future , when a young man amazes everyone with his ability to perform mathematical computations in his head , instead of relying on computers like everyone else does .
" Profession " is about a boy who is brought to a house for the feeble - minded after tests show that he is abnormal , because unlike the others , who are all educated by machines and have their professions chosen for them , he is capable of original thinking .
I 'd like to hear some opinions about some of Asimov 's books .
Do you have any ?
John Jenkins has written reviews for a great number of Asimov 's books , both fiction and nonfiction , and collected them together as Jenkins ' Spoiler - Laden Guide to Isaac Asimov .
John offers his views of what he likes and dislikes in Asimov 's books from the point of view of a dedicated Asimov enthusiast , and provides a graphical rating system that neatly summarizes his evaluations for both the Asimov fan and the intended audience of each book .
He has completed reviews for all of Asimov 's fiction books , and is currently working through his nonfiction and short stories .
What is the title of the essay that Asimov wrote concerning the ultimate self - contained , portable , high - tech reading device of the future which turns out to be a book ?
Where can I find it ?
The Tragedy of the Moon
Asimov on Science
In his story " Pate de Foie Gras " , Asimov presented a puzzle , but did not provide a solution to that puzzle .
He stated that some people wrote him with an answer immediately after the story 's publication , and as science advanced he eventually began receiving letters with another possible solution .
But he does n't say what those solutions were .
Did he ever provide the solutions , and if so , what are they ?
The problem presented in the story is that the goose lays golden eggs , and through careful scientific analysis , it is discovered that the goose is a living nuclear reactor that utilizes the isotope oxygen - 18 to convert the isotope iron - 56 to the isotope gold - 197 .
The gold production goes up if the goose is provided with water enriched in oxygen - 18 .
Further investigation shows that the something in the goose 's liver converts any radioactive isotope into a stable isotope , so if the mechanism could be discovered , it would provide a method to dispose of radioactive waste .
The problem is that there is only the one goose , whose eggs will not hatch , and if the goose dies , they will never be able to use its secret .
The scientists are able to perform a biopsy of the liver , but the small amount of cells extracted are insufficient to produce the effect .
How then , can they determine the mechanism and not have it disappear forever once the goose dies ?
The story , written in 1956 , leaves the solution as an exercise for the reader .
An abridged version of the story titled " A Very Special Goose " appeared in the September 25 , 1958 issue of Science World , a magazine for high school students published by Street and Smith , the publishers of Astounding .
In the teacher 's edition , a solution is provided in the form of a letter from Don A. Stuart , which is a pseudonym used by Astounding editor John W. Campbell .
Spoilers follow !
That solution explains that the best way to produce an environment free of oxygen - 18 is to put the goose in a sealed greenhouse , together with a gander .
The greenhouse is supplied with a sufficient quantity of plants and water for the geese to feed upon , and sunlight will keep the plants growing .
Eventually the goose will process all of the O - 18 from the air , food , and water , turning it into gold .
Once the level of O - 18 is sufficiently reduced , the goose will start laying gold - free eggs , and goslings will soon hatch .
If enough goslings survive , they can be studied to determine the mechanism of the conversion process .
The male goslings will then have to be studied to see if they can survive in an O - 18 rich environment , since if they convert it to gold , they will not be able to get rid of it by laying eggs .
Here are some of the other solutions presented in the alt .books.isaac - asimov newsgroup in the past .
Since it is the liver of the goose that is of interest , if there was a way available to grow copies of the goose 's liver , the mechanism might be studied in that way .
Thanks to modern science , it should be possible to take the cells extracted by the liver biopsy and grow such livers in the laboratory .
Because of advances in in - vitro fertilization , it might be possible to extract egg cells from the goose 's ovary , fertilize them , and implant them in a normal goose .
This assumes that the egg that grows in the surrogate mother goose is not a golden one , and enough chicks that hatch are genetically capable of developing the mechanism .
Now that various other farm animals have been cloned , it might be possible to create clones of the goose , once again assuming that the egg can grow in a normal fashion .
The advantage here is that the chicks will certainly have the same genetic capabilities as mother goose .

What records , audio tapes , videotapes , and software are available ?
Have any of Asimov 's books or stories been made into a radio production , movie or television series ?
RADIO :
The Caves of Steel : BBC Radio Play , June 1989 , faithfully adapted by Bert Coules , with Ed Bishop ( UFO 's Commander Straker ) in the role of Elijah Baley .

FILM :
Bicentennial Man :
The movie is based on Asimov 's short story " The Bicentennial Man " and Robert Silverberg 's novelization The Positronic Man , and was released in the U.S. on December 17 , 1999 .
The Touchstone Pictures production starred Robin Williams as Andrew Martin , and was directed by Chris Columbus .
Foundation :
The rights to a Foundation movie were purchased in 1994 , but as the I , Robot experience illustrates , it remains to be seen if a film will ever be produced and released .
Nightfall : A movie named Nightfall was made after a group in Hollywood bought the rights from Doubleday in the late 1980s .
The movie plot had practically no relation to the story , and by all accounts is truly and thoroughly awful .
Asimov was never consulted in the making of it , and completely disowned any responsibility for it .
Nightfall was released in 1988 , starring David Birney and Sarah Douglas ; directed by Paul Mayersberg ; running time 83 minutes .
If you should happen to have a chance to view it , run , do n't walk , the other way .
Another version of Nightfall was made and released directly to DVD in 2000 , starring David Carradine and Robert Stevens , directed by Gwyneth Libby , with a running time 85 minutes .
By all accounts , it too is dreadful .
Light Years :
An animated science fiction film from France , for which Asimov took the original , poorly done translation to English , and reworked the translation into good English .
He did not have any part in writing the script or story , concerning a warrior that begins an adventure into the future in a search to discover the unseen evil force that is destroying his world .
Light Years was released in 1988 ; directed by Rene Laloux , running time 79 minutes .
Sleeper : Asimov 's work on Woody Allen 's 1973 science fiction spoof was very minor .
In 1972 , Asimov was asked , as an expert in science and science fiction , to read over the script and identify any mistakes that Allen , who knew relatively little about those subjects , might have made .
Asimov , who was a fan of Allen 's , read the script and loved it , and stated flatly that it was perfect and needed no changes .
Asimov was offered the position of technical director for the movie , but refused , since that would require a lot of travel .
Instead he recommended Ben Bova , who took the job " and did very well " .
The Ugly Little Boy :
This short story was made into a film by Encyclopedia Britannica in the 1970s .
Star Trek - The Motion Picture :
At the request of Gene Roddenberry , Asimov provided advice for this picture , and was listed at the very end of the credits as the Science Adviser .
I , Robot : In August 1967 , John Mantley , the producer of the television show " Gunsmoke " expressed interest in Asimov 's robot stories , and paid for option rights .
The option was renewed every year for the next twelve years until finally the rights to produce a movie were bought .
After Asimov refused to do the screen adaptation , Harlan Ellison was hired , and though he wrote a screenplay in that Asimov was greatly pleased with , the movie was never made .
Ellison tells the story of his battle with Hollywood in the introduction to I , Robot : The Illustrated Screenplay , published in December 1994 .
In July 2004 , Twentieth Century Fox released a movie titled I , Robot , starring Will Smith , that was " suggested by Isaac Asimov 's book " .
The film was born as a screenplay titled " Hardwired " by screenwriter Jeff Vintar , and then , with the permission of Asimov 's estate , the title was changed and the story modified to use some characters and plot elements from Asimov 's stories .
Directed by Alex Proyas , and written by Vintar and Akiva Goldsman , the movie uses some of Asimov 's ideas , but does not attempt to recreate any of the story line in Asimov 's short story collection .
Fantastic Voyage : Rather than an Asimov story made into a movie , FV is a movie for which Asimov wrote a novelization of the screenplay .
Initially he considered such a project as beneath his dignity , but then warmed to the idea once he realized that he could include a lot of anatomy and physiology .
In his book he tried to correct some of the most glaring flaws in the screenplay , but nevertheless felt uncomfortable about the whole idea of miniaturization .
( His dissatisfaction eventually led him to write Fantastic Voyage II .)
Asimov wrote so much faster than the movie was produced that the book came out half a year before the movie was released , giving the mistaken impression that the movie was based on the book .
He is not listed in the credits of the movie because he had no part in its production .
Fantastic Voyage was released in 1966 , starring Raquel Welch , Edmond O'Brien , and Donald Pleasance ; directed by Richard Fleischer ; running time 100 minutes .
Evidence :
In September of 1946 , Asimov sold the movie , radio , and television rights to the short story " Evidence " for $ 250 to Hollywood director Orson Welles .
Welles never made a movie from the story .
TELEVISION : The Android Affair :
This is a made - for - cable movie first broadcast by the USA cable channel in April 1995 , and advertised as being " based on a story by Isaac Asimov " .
In fact , Asimov 's involvement was slight -- the actual screenplay was based on a shorter film , and Asimov was given co-credit for the story of the shorter work .
In particular , the plot is not based on any of Asimov 's published work and involves some very non-Asimovian androids , who are not positronic and gleefully lack the First Law .
Probe : Asimov was credited as adviser and co-creator of this television series , which lasted for a 2 - hour pilot and six 1 - hour episodes on ABC in 1988 before a writer 's strike came along and ended the series .
It starred Parker Stevenson as brilliant young scientist Austin James , who owned his own high - tech think tank consulting firm , and used his scientific expertise to solve baffling crimes as a sort of modern day Sherlock Holmes .
Salvage 1 : A science fiction television series starring Andy Griffith which aired on ABC in 1979 , for which Asimov served as a science adviser .
Griffith played Harry Broderick , a scrap and salvage man who undertook such adventures as building a rocket that took him to the moon to collect abandoned space hardware , moving an iceberg from the North Pole to provide water for a drought - stricken island , and pumping oil from dried - out wells .
Out of the Unknown : Six of Asimov 's stories were used for episodes of this British TV anthology series , which ran on the BBC in the U.K. for 20 episodes from 1965 to 1966 , and for a third season of 13 episodes in 1969 .
" The Dead Past " and " Sucker Bait " appeared in the first season in 1965 ; " Satisfaction Guaranteed " and " Reason " ( retitled " The Prophet " ) in the second season ( 1966 ) ; and both " Liar ! " and " The Naked Sun " ran during the third season in 1969 .
Many of these episodes no longer exist in the BBC 's film archives .
The only complete episodes remaining are " The Dead Past " and " Sucker Bait " .
A few clips from " Liar ! " and " Satisfaction Guaranteed " have also survived , and turn up from time to time in documentaries about Asimovs work .
Asimov presented an episode titled " Robot " , about developments in robotics , in December 1967 as part of the BBC documentary series " Towards Tomorrow " .
This is thought to be the original source of surviving clips from the Out of the Unknown teleplay " Satisfaction Guaranteed " and the BBC teleplay of " Caves of Steel " .
In the UK , a BBC documentary series hosted by Gillian Anderson titled " Future Fantastic " was broadcast in 1997 .
One particular edition was titled " I , Robot " , and focused a great deal on Asimov 's work .
It also contained some of the rare clips from " Liar ! " and " The Caves of Steel " .
The Caves of Steel BBC 2 did a production of The Caves of Steel that was broadcast as part of " Story Parade " on June 5 , 1964 and repeated on August 28 , 1964 .
The teleplay was by Terry Nation ( who invented " Blake 's 7 " and the Daleks in Dr. Who ) , and Elijah Baley was played by the late Peter Cushing .
It also starred John Carson and Kenneth J. Warren .
The master tapes of the program were erased , however a few clips from the production have turned up in various documentaries about Asimov 's work .
Little Lost Robot
The story " Little Lost Robot " was made as an episode of the British anthology series " Out of This World " , produced by ABC television in 1962 .
This series is commonly confused with the later BBC series " Out of the Unknown " .
" Out of This World " ran for thirteen episodes , and like the later BBC series , it presented adaptations of famous SF works as well as original teleplays .
( It was script - edited by Irene Shubik , who also script - edited the 1964 BBC version of " The Caves of Steel " , and both produced and script - edited " Out of the Unknown " ) .
The adaptation of " Little Lost Robot " is the only known surviving example of the Out of This World series , the other episodes having been erased by ABC many years ago .

The disgraced South Korean researcher whose breakthrough cloning research was exposed as a fraud in 2005 now faces up to four years in prison .
Prosecutors asked for the four - year sentence in court today , where the researcher , Hwang Woo-suk , is standing trial for fraud , misusing $ 2.25 million in state funds , and violating bioethics laws by illegally buying human eggs for his research .
" The people 's disappointment was very serious because their expectation for his stem cell research had been high , " an unidentified prosecutor told the courtroom .
He said Hwang tarnished South Korea 's image abroad ....
Hwang pleaded for leniency , saying if the court forgives him he is ready to " pour the last of my passion " into research [ AP ] .
Hwang became a national hero to South Korea in 2004 , when he claimed to have cloned human embryonic stem cells , a feat that was thought to be impossible because of the complexities of human cells .
Embryonic stem cells are of great interest to medical researchers because they can develop into any kind of adult cell , and could theoretically be used to replace malfunctioning cells that cause disease .
A year later , Hwang said the team created human embryonic stem cells genetically matched to specific patients — a purported breakthrough that promised a way to withstand rejection by a patient 's immune system [ AP ] .
But Hwang 's moment of glory did n't last long .
An investigation team at Seoul National University , where Hwang once worked , said in late 2005 that Hwang 's team deliberately fabricated vital data in the two papers on human embryonic stem cells .
It did verify , however , that Hwang 's team produced the world 's first cloned dog , an Afghan hound named Snuppy [ Reuters ] .
Following the investigation Hwang was banned from continuing his research on human embryo cloning , and he formed a company specializing in dog cloning .

House Approves Additional $ 2B for ' Cash for Clunkers ' to Continue Lawmakers hope the money will be enough to keep the program afloat , for now .
July 31 , 2009  --
The House hurriedly passed legislation today to add $ 2 billion in funding to the " Cash for Clunkers " program .
The vote was 316- 109 , and the bill now goes to the Senate , which remains in session for one more week .
But the Senate will have to pass the exact same bill since the House goes into recess today and will not be around to participate in a conference to hash out differences .
President Obama praised Congress for its quick action and said he was " pleased with the progress " made in the House .
The program " has succeeded well beyond our expectations and all expectations , and we 're already seeing a dramatic increase in showroom traffic at local car dealers , " the president said in short remarks today about the economy .
Shut out of " Cash for Clunkers " ?
Tell ABC News
The program pays consumers cash vouchers if they trade in their gas - guzzling cars for a new car .
During the debate , many Republicans expressed their support for the program but said the government needs to fix several problems , including an online redemption system that has been overwhelmed by dealers trying to file claims .
But other GOP members were not so supportive .
" The auto industry does not have a monopoly on the hard times in this country , " said Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas .
Referring to the struggling chicken farm in his district , he proposed that the government should start a " ' Cash for Cluckers ' program and pay people to eat chicken . "
Democrats argued that the program works in stimulating the economy and promoting environmentally - friendly vehicles .
The initial money allocated by Congress has disappeared so quickly is because " it is a sign that not only the program works ... but it 's ... providing a meaningful jolt to our economic recovery efforts , " said Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich .
Officials were working hard to gather money for the program , which has been so successful that the $ 1 billion allocated for it ran out within a week .
The $ 2 billion will be transferred from an untapped stimulus program , so technically , no new taxpayer money will be involved .
But Obama today said that the government would work to replace the stimulus funding being used to extend the program .
Earlier today , the White House assured Americans that the " Cash for Clunkers " program " is up and continuing to run , " at least through this weekend .
The developments came one day after conflicting government announcements that the program was broken and may , or may not , be suspended .
" We hope a lot of people go this weekend to ... look at buying a new car , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said .
" We think that incentives are good for them . "
" The administration is comfortable and confident that the money -- the previous money that was allocated through the supplemental appropriations is enough to cover those transactions and to continue operating the program , " he said at his daily press briefing .
There are roughly 20,000 certificates waiting to be processed , but the White House could not definitively say if the money is totally tapped out .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif , said an estimated 250,000 cars have been sold through the program .
" It 's something we believe can , should and will be extended . "
Gibbs said , calling it a success for car buyers , dealers , companies and taxpayers , " who are seeing people choose more fuel - efficient cars . "
He said the president not only wants the program to continue , he wants to see it expanded .
Lawmakers earlier today urged their constituents to take advantage of the program -- while it lasts -- and there was obvious uncertainty in Washington about the long - term future of the program .
" We do n't know how long it will last , so people should go to their car dealers now if they want to take advantage of the program , " Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , said in a statement .
" We 're also going to seek additional funding to hopefully make the program last longer . "
Funds Running Out
" Cash for Clunkers " was supposed to continue through Nov. 1 , 2009 , or until the money ran out .
Given the hit of the U.S. government 's plan , which was designed to help the struggling auto industry , that money was guzzled up way before the fall time frame .
With the number of dealers participating , if each completed just a dozen " Cash for Clunkers " deals , the $ 1 billion would be spent .
And some dealers have initiated more like 250 " Cash for Clunkers " deals -- 20 times what the government was expecting .
" It was the right idea , but it was the cart before the horse , " Scott Addison of Fitzgerald Auto Mall in Gaithersburg , Md. , told ABC News ' Elisabeth Leamy .
Addison 's sales staff was rushing to process " Cash for Clunkers " transactions before the government slammed the brakes on the program .
Conflicting Reports
On Thursday evening , the Department of Transportation told lawmakers it was suspending the " Cash for Clunkers " program at the stroke of midnight .
But then later the White House said it was still working to find other options .
" We are working tonight to assess the situation facing what is obviously an incredibly popular program , " Gibbs said of what officially is called the Car Allowance Rebate System .
" Auto dealers and consumers should have confidence that all valid car transactions that have taken place to date will be honored . "
The official Web site http://www.cars.gov showed there was still $ 779 million left -- clearly not the case .
Even " Cash for Clunkers " commercials are still running for a number of automakers .
Part of the problem ?
The government Web site dealers must use to enter clunker deals is a clunker itself , sputtering and stalling .
The computer crashes have caused a backlog : as many as 25,000 transactions that dealers have made but the government has n't yet officially approved .
" They think they 've given out this much , but there 's a line this long trying to get in the door , " said Addison .
" It was too good of a deal to pass up , " said Greg Burge , one of the estimated 250,000 consumers trying to take advantage of the program , which gives as much as $ 4,500 dollars for trading in a gas guzzler for a more efficient brand new vehicle .
" I was sort of afraid that all of the money would be gone before then , so when they called and said that it came in early I was really happy , " said Greg 's wife Lori Burge .
' Cash for Clunkers ' Guidelines
Here 's how the " Cash for Clunkers " program works :
People who owned a car made in 1984 or later that got 18 miles to the gallon or less could qualify .
The car had to have been registered and insured over the past year , and it must have been able to start .
If applicants to the program traded their clunker for a car that got four more miles per gallon , the government gave them $ 3,500 .
If the new car got 10 miles more per gallon , the person got $ 4,500 .
People trading an SUV , minivan or small pickup only had to improve their mileage by 2 to 5 miles per gallon .
The vehicle purchased had to be brand new and cost less than $ 45,000 .

I know there are many on this board .
What I 'd especially like to know are follows :
a) How did you once become a truther ?
I am not looking for answers , like " watching Loose Change " .
If possible , I 'd like you to write in a bit more detailed manner , like " I watched Loose Change , and started surfing the internet .
All I could find were more truther sites , which further reinforced my truther status ... etc " or something like that .
b ) What convinced you back from truther to non-truther ?
Once again , I hope you do not respond something like " truthers are dumb " , but a bit more specific .
c ) What are your thoughts nowadays about your time as a truther ?
What mistakes you made back then ?
Were you 100 % convinced , agressively promoting the truth ?
Whatever comes to your mind .
I can give examples from my own experiences .
a ) Conspiracy theories were very remote to me before 9/11 truth .
Of course , I had heard that there were some JFK conspiracy theories , but had never gone through any of the claims in detail .
Then all of a sudden , I was exposed to some truther propaganda .
I went surfing the internet and found only more and more stuff reinforcing the conspiracy point of view .
I guess it was the lack of any previous exposure to any conspiracy theories , combined with the massive amounts of conspiracy material so easily found in the internet , that made me a truther for a short while .
I had no experience dealing with this kind of false claims .
I thought at least most of the stuff had to be for real .
b ) I started debating my ( conspiracy ) point of view , but every time I came out disappointed .
I always thought I had a weaker case .
But still , I could support my case pretty cleverly , if I only distorted some evidence a little bit , ignored some other evidence , etc .
Until I reached the point , when I was so frustrated with it all , I knew I had no case .
I knew very well the points each side was making .
It was a non-contest .
I became a debunker overnight .
But it took me a couple of months of trutherism and defending my weak points , before I fully realized I was wrong .
c ) I am somewhat embarrassed , that I was lured into the conspiracy world so easily .
I had always thought I was critical of evidence .
I had always thought I can not be fooled .
And there I was , claiming WTC demolition .
But that time also taught me a lot .
One has to be very careful with stuff that sounds exiting , but you have no previous experience with .
Because once you take the first wrong step , it is very easy to convince yourself with further evidence supporting the wrong conclusion , while twisting in your mind the evidence that does n't .
Share your thoughts , all people that once believed even some of the truther stuff .
I might do some writing about this subject , if I get enough material .
We have a thread for ex-believers .
You can either bump it or respond to the questions here if you want to participate .

Well , it ’s been a tough week , and it did n’t help that finding a comic idea suitable for this week was tough as well .
I just kept thinking , “ Is this the week we do n’t deliver ? ”
Despite my uncertainty with how we would come through , CK knocked it out of the park with his guest strip , so thank you for that !
Not sure I ’m feeling it with this comic … but since it was Tim ’s idea , I can at least sleep with a fairly neutral conscious .
For those of you who do n’t know what a kill screen is here ’s the link to understand our joke this week .
Mr Singh said ' we do not seek to threaten anyone '
India has launched its first nuclear - powered submarine , becoming only the sixth country in the world to do so .
The 6,000 tonne Arihant was launched by India 's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at a ceremony on the south - east coast .
It was built entirely in India with Russian assistance and a second one is due to be constructed shortly .
It will undergo trials over the next few years before being deployed and will be able to launch missiles at targets 700 km ( 437 miles ) away .
Until now , only the US , Russia , France , Britain and China had the capability to build nuclear submarines .
' China threat '
Launching the INS Arihant , Mr Singh said India had no aggressive designs on anyone .
India has relied mainly on Russian - built submarines until now But the sea was becoming increasingly relevant to India 's security concerns , he added .
" It is incumbent upon us to take all measures necessary to safeguard our country and to keep pace with technological advancements worldwide , " he told the ceremony in the port city of Visakhapatnam .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says until now India has been able to launch ballistic missiles only from the air and from land .
Nuclear submarines will add a third dimension to its defence capability .
When it is eventually deployed , the top - secret Arihant will be able to carry 100 sailors on board .
It will be able to stay under water for long periods and thereby increase its chances of remaining undetected .
By contrast , India 's ageing conventional diesel - powered submarines need to constantly surface to recharge their batteries .
Our correspondent says the launching of the Arihant is a clear sign that India is looking to blunt the threat from China which has a major naval presence in the region .

On Friday , we learned that the unemployment rate jumped to 9.4 percent from last month ’s 8.9 percent .
The BLS data surveys 160,000 businesses and government agencies that affect roughly 400,000 people so the data does cover a large portion of Americans and gives us a good sample size .
The markets were largely moving sideways on Friday unable to make sense of the mixed data because we are still largely living through a highly volatile market .
Yet the interesting thing that happened on Friday was the jobs lost in May were much smaller than expected .
The market was expecting a 500,000 + job loss month and only 345,000 jobs were lost for the month .
Yet the market was also expecting a rise of the unemployment rate to 9.2 percent while it spiked up to 9.4 percent , the 0.5 percent jump is tied for the largest monthly jump since the recession started ( the other major monthly jump occurred in February ) .
So this is good news right ?
Well any time we see job losses abating that in fact is good news but we have to look at the data more closely before arriving at any major conclusions :
It is clear that the actual raw number of job losses is improving but the troubling sign is deeper in the data .
Nothing highlights this more than Wal - Mart announcing it will hire 22,000 workers and expand while General Motors on Monday announced it would be filing for bankruptcy and downsizing .
We are shifting to retail low wage work while destroying higher paying manufacturing work .
Let us first look at what occurred in May :
Click for sharper image
As you can see from the chart the biggest sector to lose jobs in May was “ goods - producing ” jobs which pay higher wages .
We saw an increase in leisure and hospitality work .
This would be good if it was n’t the case that we were replacing $ 20 per hour jobs with $ 10 per hour jobs selling goods produced in other countries .
Now if we look at the hourly wages we start realizing that there may be little improvement in the employment picture when it comes to better paying jobs :
Now why is this occurring ?
Well the first thing we need to understand is that this is the deepest recession since World War II and probably since the Great Depression .
The large pseudo - prosperity of the past three decades has been based on major bubbles including the housing and technology bubbles .
Now much of the good paying jobs during this decade occurred in the finance and real estate sectors .
Those jobs are largely disappearing and not earning what they once did .
But more troubling has been our systematic dismantling of manufacturing .
The case of Wal - Mart contrasted with GM this week tells us where we are heading .
We are breaking our employment base into a largely service driven economy .
For all those claiming this is good ask those people working in manufacturing who just lost $ 20 per hour jobs and now are battling it out for $ 10 per hour jobs at Wal - Mart .
This did not occur over night :
As you can see , since the early 1980s we have replaced “ durable good ” jobs with “ leisure and hospitality jobs ” which basically means we stopped making things and started consuming things in large quantities .
Unfortunately we did all of this with massive amounts of debt that have now put our country at risk .
If we break down the unemployment numbers further , we see that nearly 26,000,000 American workers are either unemployed or underemployed :
Unemployed : 14,500,000
Part - time workers : 9,100,000
Marginally Attached : 2,200,000
Total = 25,800,000 unemployed or underemployed workers
The U - 6 rate is at its highest point ever measuring a more accurate picture of the employment situation registering a 16.4 percent rate .
It is amazing how high our part - time work force has now become .
Keep in mind the large number in this group have no benefits and no security of a full - time job .
The growth in this area is troubling .
In May of 2008 , we had 5.2 million workers classified as “ part - time for economic reasons .
Now , that number has grown to 9.1 million .
An increase of 75 percent in only one year is troubling but this is the new trend of replacing $ 20 per hour jobs with $ 10 per hour jobs .
Although it is good news that job losses are not so deep , one $ 20 job lost is the equivalent of two people finding $ 10 per hour jobs .

GUN PUTZ
More proof in my book that wackos who " open- carry " their firearms are often cowards compensating for their shortfalls in other areas : AR - 15 slinger Christopher Broughton .
That 's the name of the guy who caused all the hubbub recently by bringing a loaded assault rifle to greet President Barack Obama at his address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars at the Phoenix Convention Center .
It was revealed rather quickly that the whole incident was a staged interview , a publicity stunt that successfully put the guy who orchestrated it — libertarian nutjob Ernie Hancock — and his Web site FreedomsPhoenix.com on the news map for about 15 seconds .
Info 7 Soles
But though Broughton , a nerdy , horn - rim - wearing 28 - year - old , was badass enough to tote that big gun outside where the Prez was speaking , he was keeping his identity a secret until recently .
Indeed , the whole libertarian community was aiding him , referring to him only as Chris or Chris B. in the gun-worshippin ' diatribes that hailed him as a hero .
When confronted by the Arizona Republic with his last name , Broughton only reluctantly ' fessed up , saying , aw shucks , he did n't wanna be a celebrity or nothin ' .
He did n't really want to ( echoing the words of Thomas Jefferson ) water the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants , as such loonies normally claim .
" I do n't want to be Joe the Plumber , " he told the Rep .
" I do n't want to be famous . "
But Broughton , who , according to the Federal Elections Commission , once gave moonhowlin ' liber - tard - ian Congressman Ron Paul $ 300 for his presidential run and who listed his profession as " tech mold / apprentice mold maker " ( dare to dream ! ) , was singing a slightly different tune during his appearance on conspiracy maven Alex Jones ' radio show .
Nah , Broughton was n't copping to his last name there , either .
But he was reveling in the attention from Jones , a man who believes the " global elite " regularly gather at the Bohemian Grove retreat in Northern California to worship Beelzebub or some other occult deity , a man who believes the swine flu vaccine is poison meant for the masses , and who has been a huge supporter of the insanity that 9/11 was an inside job by the George W. Bush administration .
" He 's quite a hero to the 2nd Amendment , " gushed the paranoid lip - flapper about " Chris . "
Broughton advised Jones he was more an " anarchist " than a libertarian and that he was a follower of Tempe Pastor Steven Anderson , the Baptist preacher known for his weird run-ins with the U.S. Border Patrol , the most famous of which got his car window busted into and him Tasered .
The interview was full of exchanges like this one , punctuated by ads Jones does for different survivalist products :
" Fundamentally , we need to all be armed , " opined Jones .
" If you 're a good , honest person , " seconded Broughton , " would n't you want to be armed ? "
But Broughton 's most interesting comments came in response to a caller , Jake in Texas , who suggested that Chris should have told a woman at the Obama event — who had criticized the militaristic accoutrement slung over his shoulder — that he was there to protect the U.S. chief executive .
" You should have said , " offered Jake , sarcastically , " ' We 're actually here to defend the president against assassination from these crazed healthcare maniacs who 're just finding what 's going on . ' "
" To be honest with you , " snickered Broughton in reply , " I definitely was n't there to do that . "
Would Broughton and Ernie Hancock and Alex Jones applaud if someone went Lee Harvey Oswald on President Obama .
I 'm guessing they would as long as they were n't implicated in any way .
The nation is slouching ever closer to a really ugly bout of violence cheered on by gun crazies and self - described " patriots . "
Remember back in the day when it was considered bad manners — no matter if you hated the guy or not — to wish ill on the president ?
Man , how far we 've regressed .
LIARS AND LAWYERS
It must be great to be an MCSO deputy .
You get to arrest somebody who opposes your boss , Sheriff Joe Arpaio .
You get to blow off subpoenas from his attorney and drag out the legal process on the taxpayers ' dime .
Then , if an angry judge dismisses the case against your target , you can get the county attorney to appeal .
This is apparently what happened in the case of Orlando Arenas , a 28 - year - old pro-immigrant community activist who works with various human - rights organizations in town , such as Salvador Reza 's Puente .
Arenas was near Tent City in February when Arpaio did his infamous " 200 Mexican March , " segregating Mexican nationals in custody by parading them past TV cameras , all for the greater glory of Arpaio .
Arenas was already well known to Joe 's flunkies for his nearly daily presence outside the Wells Fargo Building , where the MCSO keeps two floors of pricey , executive offices and where Puente has kept up a sign - waving , drum - banging protest of the sheriff for about a year now .
The MCSO 's arrest report for Arenas notes that Deputy Lindsey Smith , who works on the 19th floor of the Wells Fargo Building as part of the sheriff 's media staff ( or at least used to ; she may do something else up there now ) , told the arresting officers that Arenas , who was quietly filming the event with a video camera , needed to go .
" Deputy Smith advised that she had seen [ Arenas ] filming at recent immigrations protests during Sheriff 's Office saturation patrols , " reads the report .
Arenas was asked to depart county property and dutifully did , catching a ride with another activist .
Unfortunately , the driver of the car drove back onto county property and parked near Tent City .
Arenas immediately left the vehicle and began walking off the property .
That 's when he was arrested .
Never mind that Arenas was trying to exit .
Two MCSO deputies collared him before he could leave , kinda like the MCSO did to ACLU legal director Dan Pochoda in 2007 at Pruitt 's Home Furnishings , where they had to run after Pochoda to " trespass " him before he could get in his car and drive off .
In fact , I happened to be covering Arpaio 's disgusting 200 Mexican March and I saw Arenas getting detained .
If the deputies had waited less than five minutes , he would have been off the county property .
Arenas ended up spending a day in the Fourth Avenue Jail being booked and processed before he was released on a $ 150 bond .
Fast - forward to May , when Arenas ' lawyer , Christopher Dupont , after trying unsuccessfully to get Lindsey Smith and another deputy involved to respond to subpoenas ordering them to appear for depositions , filed a motion asking Justice of the Peace Armando Gandarilla to impose sanctions on the MCSO for not cooperating .
Dupont was accusing the deputies involved of ignoring court orders , a big no -no , and he wanted Gandarilla to dismiss the case with prejudice ( meaning the county attorney could not re-file the charges ) and to award him attorney fees paid by the MCSO as further punishment .
On July 28 , there was a hearing before JP Gandarilla to resolve the matter .
None other than MCSO Deputy Chief Jack MacIntyre appeared as a witness for the prosecution , as well as Deputy Lindsey Smith , and Deputy D. Sanchez , one of the arresting officers .
Dupont did a very wise thing .
He asked Gandarilla to have the witnesses sit outside the courtroom and testify separately so that they could not tailor their testimony based on what the others said on the stand .
Gandarilla so ordered , and MacIntyre was the first at bat .
Why was MacIntyre there ?
See , Smith had been subpoenaed , and when the MCSO gets a subpoena ( as it must get many a day ) it goes through internal processing and is delivered to the person subpoenaed — in this case , Smith .
It seems someone faxed Smith the subpoena .
She claimed she did n't know how to handle it , and so she asked MacIntyre , who is a lawyer and her superior , what to do .
What MacIntyre then did depends on whom you ask , Smith or MacIntyre .
" My best memory of it was , she got a fax , " MacIntyre said under oath , adding later , " Then I suggested to Lindsey that she try and contact the prosecutors office [ about it ] . "
" To your knowledge , " asked Deputy County Attorney Christine Trusken , " did you ever advise [ Smith ] to ignore a court order ? "
" I never advised anybody to ignore a court order , " answered MacIntyre , who also claimed that he was unaware of who the defendant was in the case .
Smith , MacIntyre 's subordinate , had an entirely different account .
She said she asked MacIntyre about it , and he told her not to go to the court - appointed deposition .
She also told Trusken that she gave MacIntyre " some history on the defendant . "
In other words , according to Smith , MacIntyre knew this was a case involving an anti-Joe activist .
" And I was directed not to go , " said Smith .
" You were told not to go ? " wondered Trusken .
" Right , " replied Smith .
Again , Trusken : " And that was by Mac­Intyre ? "
" Right , " affirmed Smith .
Remember , Trusken's on the side of Smith and MacIntyre , not Arenas .
Maybe she should have had the pair get their stories straight before they hopped on the stand within minutes of each other .
Under questioning from Dupont , Smith was petulant , childish .
She had to twice be admonished by Gandarilla not to raise her voice and to answer Dupont 's queries .
Smith ultimately admitted that she had no idea where she had put the faxed subpoena .
It could be in the trash or on her desk under some files — she did n't know .
Both Smith and , unbelievably , MacIntyre — who testified that he 's been licensed to practice law in the state of Arizona for decades — said they did n't know the document in question , the one faxed internally to Smith , was a court order .
MacIntyre also testified , rather uncomfortably , that he did n't know how subpoenas were served at the MCSO 's offices .
Incensed , Dupont demanded that Gandarilla dismiss the case , accusing MacIntyre and Smith of being , ahem , less than honest .
" [ They think ] they 're above the law , " argued Dupont .
" And when they get caught , they 're willing to come here and lie about it . "
Trusken pleaded with Gandarilla to not dismiss the whole case because of what she insisted was a violation of the discovery rules .
But Gandarilla agreed with Dupont , stating that he believed the conflict in Smith and MacIntyre 's testimony " poisoned " the case .
" No way should this case be heard , " Gandarilla replied to the prosecutor .
" I want the appropriate sanctions .
I want defense counsel to submit the cost of your services .
And the sheriff 's department will pay .
That 's my judgment . "
So far , Dupont says he has not submitted any documents asking for legal fees .
However , the county attorney has , according to Gandarilla 's office , appealed the case to Superior Court .
What , so Smith and MacIntyre can dissemble some more about it ?
This stupid bit of retaliation against a minor foe of the sheriff snowballed to the point that two MCSO deputies — at least one of whom should know better — ended up contradicting each other and revealing the contempt with which they view the legal system .
And all for a bogus trespassing case .
SEVEN SUNS
Pedro Ultreras ' brutal , uncompromising film 7 Soles ( 7 Suns ) , which depicts the plight of a group of migrants crossing the Sonoran Desert is a must - see for all Americans who want to understand the sheer horror some immigrants are willing to endure to come to this country .
In it , director Ultreras , a former reporter for Telemundo and Univision , weaves together true - life tales of migrants trying to make it to the relative safety of a Phoenix drop - house .
I saw the film 's Phoenix première the other day .
The theater was so packed that I and others had to sit on the floor .
Often , depictions of the plight of migrants are melodramatic and one - sided , but 7 Soles was neither .
In the film , human smugglers ( coyotes ) , as depicted by Gustavo Sánchez Parra and Phoenix 's Luis Avila , are the personifications of thuggishness , selfishness , and criminality .
Throughout the film , there are murders , rapes , people left to die in the desert and very little redemption .
If you know Luis Avila , recognizable because of his activism locally and his theater work here ( he 's the director of the play The Tears of Lives , which I blogged about recently ) , you may be shocked by his portrayal of the coyote Gavilan .
Avila was heavier when the film was shot .
His success at making you believe he 's capable of numerous , heinous acts is a tribute to his acting chops .
The plot involves Parra 's coyote character , Negro , and Avila 's character , Gavilan , transporting a group of 15 men , women , and children across the border .
Problem is , their route is being closely watched by the U.S. Border Patrol , so the coyotes have to take a more scenic path , so to speak , and that 's when the suffering kicks in full blast .
If the sun and the scorpions do n't get you , dehydration , lack of food and medicine , or violent confrontations with and between the human smugglers , just might .
I should also mention the moving performance of Mexican actress Evangelina Sosa , who portrays a woman crossing with her two small children .
Sosa ends up appealing to what little good there is in Negro , though how successful she is , you 'll have to find out for yourselves .
I do n't want to give away too much , but the drama definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat .
Although it 's been playing for four months in Mexico , Ultreras explained in a Q&A after the screening that U.S. distribution 's been difficult to obtain because the film's in Spanish with English subtitles , and it 's hardly the sort of feel - good fare many Americans prefer .
That 's too bad , because I 'm certain this movie could find a wider audience , particularly in Arizona , because much of the film was shot in the desert and in Phoenix , where 100 extras were used in a drop - house scene .
The première and a subsequent screening were benefits for No More Deaths / No Mas Muertes .
Currently , the film has no regular engagement in the United States , but there will be another screening at 6:30 p.m. September 3 at Harkins Arizona Mills to benefit the Macehualli Day Labor Center .
Admission will be $ 10 , and Ultreras will be there for a Q&A afterwards .
Although Ultreras is looking to show the film elsewhere in the Phoenix area , he has no guarantees , so I urge everyone with an interest in the subject , or just in seeing a gripping piece of filmmaking , to check it out .

A 24 - year - old arrested this morning on suspicion of smashing 11 windows at Colorado Democratic Party headquarters tried to conceal his identity while allegedly committing the crime , according to police descriptions .
Maurice Schwenkler wore a shirt over his face , a hooded sweat shirt and latex gloves before he and another man fled the scene on bicycles , police said .
Schwenkler was apprehended after a short chase .
The other suspect remains at large .
While Schwenkler does not appear in the state ’s voter registration database , a person by that name in November 2008 received $ 500 from a political 527 committee called Colorado Citizens Coalition for “ communications , ” according to campaign finance disclosures .
The accountant for the 527 appears to be the same woman who handles the books for many other Democratic - leaning political committees .
A Maurice Schwenkler also signed an online 2005 petition to free anti-war Christian protesters who were captured in Iraq .
State Democratic Party Chairwoman
Pat Waak initially blamed the vandalism on animosity surrounding the health care debate , though Denver police declined to comment on possible motives .
The shattered windows were emblazoned with posters touting President Barack Obama and the Democratic position on health care reform .
The other storefronts surrounding the building on West Eighth Avenue and Santa Fe Drive in downtown Denver ’s art district were untouched .
But the Democratic posters are scuffed from hammer blows , Waak said .
“ We ought to be having a serious , conscientious debate about what ’s best for the country , ” Waak said .
“ Clearly there ’s been an effort on the other side to stir up hate .
I think this is the consequence of it . ”
She estimates the damage at $ 11,000 .
An officer on patrol spotted vandals in the act around 2:20 a.m. and took Schwenkler into custody after a short chase , Denver police spokeswoman Vicki Ferrari said .
Former pinup girl and television actress Farrah Fawcett passed away from cancer today at the age of 62 .
Fawcett was best know for her role as Jill Munroe on the 70’s hit Charlies Angles , and for the iconic poster below which helped launched her career into stardom .
Her long time love Ryan O’Neil released the following statement :
“ After a long and brave battle with cancer , our beloved Farrah has passed away .
Although this is an extremely difficult time for her family and friends , we take comfort in the beautiful times that we shared with Farrah over the years and the knowledge that her life brought joy to so many people around the world . ”
She will be missed .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Two Democratic senators called on the Pentagon to take back more than $ 83 million in bonuses paid to military contractor KBR after a Defense Department report criticized its electrical work on U.S. bases overseas .
Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , a 24 - year - old Green Beret , died in a shower at his base in Iraq in January 2008 .
" I want them to tell us on what basis can they possibly continue to justify having paid $ 83 million of the taxpayers ' money for shoddy work that resulted in risk to our soldiers , " Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota told reporters Friday .
Dorgan said he and Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania are pressing Defense Department officials to reclaim $ 83.4 million in bonus payments it awarded KBR for its work in Iraq .
Based on the findings of a report issued Monday by the Defense Department 's inspector general on the electrocution deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq , Casey said the Pentagon should fine KBR and " make it hurt and make it count . "
" These are just absolutely stunning conclusions about failures by KBR as well as failures by our government , " Casey said .
The Houston , Texas - based military contractor defended its performance , saying Friday that Dorgan and Casey " are wrong in their assertion that we have been derelict in our duties to protect the troops . "
" The safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains KBR's top priority , " KBR spokeswoman Sarah Engdahl said in a statement .
The Pentagon report concluded that the death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , a decorated Green Beret from Pennsylvania , stemmed from failures both by the U.S. military and by KBR .
The company did not properly ground and inspect electrical equipment , the report found , while Maseth 's commanders failed to ensure renovations to the building where he was quartered had been properly done and the Army did not set electrical standards for jobs or contractors .
Maseth was electrocuted in a shower in his Baghdad quarters -- a former palace of deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- in January 2008 .
KBR has said the palace was not properly grounded by contractors when it was built .
The Pentagon report concluded that KBR failed to ground a water pump at the building , and the company did not report improperly grounded equipment during routine maintenance .
Maseth 's family is suing the company .
Two lawsuits against KBR in the death of another soldier were dismissed earlier this week , and Engdahl said KBR " maintains that its investigation has produced no evidence linking KBR to Staff Sgt. Maseth 's death . "
Dorgan said the inspector general 's report found KBR 's work throughout Iraq was of poor quality , with more than 53,000 sites in need of upgrades or repair as of March .
" The question for us is , when will there be accountability -- accountability that requires contractors to measure up ? " he said .
" And how do we get that from both the Pentagon and contractors ? "
Maseth 's mother , Cheryl Harris , said wiring problems are a problem for U.S. troops in Afghanistan as well .
" I do know firsthand that our troops are continuing to be shocked -- even in showers in Afghanistan , " said Harris , who joined the senators at a news conference Friday .
" I still have contact with a lot of soldiers on the ground over there . "

More than a half billion people use online social networks , posting vast amounts of information about themselves to share with online friends and colleagues .
A new study co-authored by a researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI ) has found that the practices of many popular social networking sites typically make that personal information available to companies that track Web users ' browsing habits and allow them to link anonymous browsing habits to specific people .
The study , presented recently in Barcelona at the Workshop on Online Social Networks , part of the annual conference of the Association for Computing Machinery 's Special Interest Group on Data Communications , is the first to describe a mechanism that tracking sites could use to directly link browsing habits to specific individuals .
" When you sign up with a social networking site , you are assigned a unique identifier , " says Craig Wills , professor of computer science at WPI , who conducted the study with an industry colleague .
" This is a string of numbers or characters that points to your profile .
We found that when social networking sites pass information to tracking sites about your activities , they often include this unique identifier .
So now a tracking site not only has a profile of your Web browsing activities , it can link that profile to the personal information you post on the social networking site .
Now your browsing profile is not just of somebody , it is of you . "
Like most commercial websites , online social networks use third - party tracking sites , called aggregators , to learn about the browsing habits of their visitors .
Cookies are maintained by a Web browser and contain information that enable tracking sites to build profiles of the websites visited by a user .
Each time the user visits a new website , the tracking site can review those cookies and serve up ads that might appeal to the user .
For example , if the user frequently visits food sites , he or she might see an ad for a new cookbook .
Online networking sites have gone a step further by allowing for transmission of unique identifiers .
It is a particularly troubling practice for two reasons , Wills says .
" First , " he notes .
" users put a lot of information about themselves on social networking sites .
Second , a lot of that information can be seen by other users , by default .
There are mechanisms users can use to limit access to their information , but we found through previous research that most users do n't take advantage of them . "
With a unique identifier , a tracking site could gain access to a user 's name , physical address , email address , gender , birth date , educational and employment information , and much more .
With the " leakage " of this type personal information , there is a significant risk of having one 's identity linked to an inaccurate or misleading browsing profile .
Browsing profiles record the websites a particular computer has accessed , not who was using the computer at the time or why particular sites were chosen .
According to Wills , this leaves room for inaccurate profiling by tracking sites , a situation that has the potential to lead to serious problems .
When a computer is used by more than one person , or a person browses for curiosity rather than intent , it leaves room for misinterpretation , he notes .
" Tracking sites do n't have the ability to know if , for example , a site about cancer was visited out of curiosity , or because the user actually has cancer .
Profiling is worrisome on its own , but inaccurate profiling could potentially lead to issues with employment , health care coverage , or other areas of our personal lives . "
Wills says the researchers do not know what , if anything , tracking sites do with the unique identifiers that social networks transmit to them .
They say they have communicated with all of the sites they studied to inform them about the privacy leakage , but have not heard back officially from any .
" We are not saying that they are necessarily trying to leak private information , " he says .
" But once someone is in possession of your unique identifier , there is so much they can learn about you .
And even if tracking sites do not use the information themselves , can they guarantee that it will never find its way into other hands ?
For these reasons , we feel this issue is something that we should to be concerned about . "
The researchers also note that while users of social networking sites can protect themselves to some degree by limiting the amount of information they post and using the protections the sites make available to them to limit access to their information , the easiest way to prevent privacy leakage would be for social networking sites to stop making unique identifiers visible .

Similarly , the penitentiary in Bruges had no defense against a helicopter .
There are anti-helicopter nets that could be placed over prison courtyards , but they are expensive and complicated to install .
Still , the helicopter pilot later reported that he had not seen a single prison guard in the courtyard when he landed .

To give credit to the police and prison guards , of the six convicts who clambered over the wall of their penitentiary , four were rounded up almost immediately .
Most of the other convicts who escaped in recent weeks have been caught , some in Belgium , others in France or Morocco .
The minister of justice , Stefaan De Clerck , is now in the hot seat .
A decade ago , Mr. De Clerck was forced to resign as minister after a notorious rapist and murderer , Marc Dutroux , overpowered guards while being transferred to a courthouse without handcuffs , took one of their guns and escaped .
He was caught a few hours later , but the event prompted the passage of laws to increase the effectiveness of the police and prisons .
Since early last year , Mr. De Clerck , 57 , has been back in the job , helped there by his leadership of the Christian Democrats , a crucial player in the coalition government .
In his office in the shadow of the towering , scaffolded dome of the Palace of Justice , he admitted that more had to be done on security , in jails and courthouses .
After the Dutroux scandal , he said , most attention focused “ more on the human side , on the victims , sexual delinquents , reform of the police . ”
The escapes have riveted the public here .
Lesley Deckers , 23 , lived with her mother in the town of Hoboken , in Flanders , where she grew up playing soccer and taking part in youth clubs .
When Ms. Deckers was 18 she converted to Islam .
Her boyfriend , Mohammed Johri , also 23 , was a Moroccan man sentenced to five years in prison last year for robbing a toy store and a supermarket .
Ms. Deckers hired a sightseeing helicopter , under the pseudonym Kelly Verstraeten , to enable the convicts in Bruges to escape .
One local newspaper , Gazet van Antwerpen , ran a photo of her this week , after she was caught by the police , over the headline , “ I Did It For Love . ”
“ It ’s a pity she had to go that far , ” said Kim Nolf , 32 , a Hoboken city official .
Mr. Johri and a fellow escapee , Ashraf Sekkaki , 26 , used Ms. Deckers ’s beat - up Peugeot , robbed some banks in Flanders , looting about $ 144,000 , according to the local press , then made their way via Spain to Morocco .
But the Belgian police alerted the Moroccans , and people in the men ’s villages were alarmed by the sudden presence of large numbers of police officers , and turned the men in .
For $ 19 , I would n’t expect much out of my hotel room .
But a bed , lights and toilet paper are among the things I would consider to be basic necessities at any price .
That ’s not the case at the Rancho Bernardo Inn , where guests can elect to have different features of their hotel room removed in order to decrease the price .
The “ Survivor Package ” starts at $ 219 for deluxe accommodations and breakfast for two .
Take out the breakfast and the price goes down to $ 199 .
Take out the AC or heat and you ’re looking at $ 159 .
The removal of pillows , sheets , lights , linens , and toiletries decreases the price incrementally to just $ 39 .
Then things really get interesting .
For $ 19 , the resort will remove the bed and replace it with a tent .
Basically , you ’re paying for an indoor campsite .
The hotel ’s manager says he wanted to do “ something different ” for a promotion .
This gives guests on a budget a cheap , and memorable , way to enjoy the resort , which is set on 20,000 acres in San Diego .
There ’s a a golf course , three pools , three restaurants , and a spa that was named as the best by Conde Nast in 2008 .
The deal has already been quite popular , with over 50 people making reservations for the $ 19 rooms .
The promotion will run from August 16 to 31 .

You might remember my post about Felix Treitler ’s new spin on therapy a few weeks ago .
If not , here ’s a little refresher course : Felix Treitler is a Boston - based Certified Tennis Professional and Licensed Therapist who has combined his love of physical activity and helping others to create an interesting kind of therapy .
This week , I was able to email with Treitler about this new kind of “ sports therapy ” ( for which I learned there is a more appropriate name ) , how he came to combine his two passions to provide this therapy to clients , and the positive responses he ’s received from both clients and mental health professionals thus far .
Read on !
Alicia Sparks :
Before we dive into anything else , why do n’t you explain the kind of therapy you ’re offering ?
And do you use an “ official ” name for it ?
Felix Treitler : More accurately , it might be called something like “ Activity Therapy ” because it involves more than just sports .
It works with games like chess , or activities like acting , improvising , playing music , or hiking , or others .
The idea is that someone is more likely to engage in “ therapy ” if it is connected to something else they enjoy or are good at .
Also , more active things tend to make people feel better as has been proven by many studies involving the mental health benefits of exercise .
One of the problems with Therapy up until this point is that many people drop out .
Also , it has often been described as a painful and difficult experience .
I do n’t believe it has to be .
On the contrary , it can be quite enjoyable .
Sparks :
A tennis professional and a therapist – what prompted you to finally merge those two very different careers and form the service you ’re offering now ?
Treitler : I have been a Certified Tennis Professional for over 25 years , and a Licensed Therapist as well .
Up until now , I have done those jobs separately .
I finally decided that it was time to combine them into one job as there are so many similarities between the two .
As I explained , tennis is one activity that I know a lot about , but I do lots of other activities as well .
I do n’t want to exclude people who do n’t play tennis .
Sparks :
Before yourself , had you ever heard of – or witnessed – another mental health professional using this sports therapy technique ?
Treitler : Not really .
I ’ve seen some variations of it , but not exactly what I have in mind .
Again , using exercise as an “ anti- depressant ” is n’t a new concept , so I ’m just adding onto that idea .
Endorphins and serotonin levels are increased during all kinds of activities , so it is a natural to merge activity with other aspects of therapy , like talking and changing thought patterns .
Sparks :
You started your practice two years ago , correct ?
What is the biggest challenge you ’ve faced since then ?
Treitler :
The biggest challenge I ’ve faced is simply getting the word out and explaining to people what it is all about .
It is a new way of approaching Therapy , so most people have n’t heard of it and may find it takes some time to get used to .
My website is almost finished and it will explain the process in detail .
I ’m also choosing to do interviews and get articles printed about it so people can understand it better .
Sparks :
And , what has been the most rewarding experience of introducing your area to this kind of therapy ?
Treitler :
The most rewarding experience has been the positive response by clients and professionals to the idea of this kind of Therapy .
Because it is such a sensible idea , everyone has supported it and even has asked how they could help promote it .
Clients tend to love it because it is new , fun , and very effective .
My mission in life all along has been to help people with a variety of problems , and now I found a way to do it that I enjoy as well .
This makes it more likely that I will be able to do it for a very long time .
Sparks :
What are some of the reactions you ’ve gotten from other mental health professionals when they learn about what you ’re doing with sports and therapy ?
Treitler : Most of the reactions have been extremely positive .
I am beginning to collaborate with other professionals and organizations who are doing things that are related .
I can envision forming a bigger organization that specializes in “ Activity Therapy ” so it can reach more people and so I do n’t have to feel “ isolated ” in a private practice .
Sparks :
How would you respond to someone who said , “ You know , Felix , I ’m really good at talking , but I am no good on the tennis court . ”
Treitler :
Well , fortunately , I practice more traditional forms of Therapy as well , so they would n’t have to go far !
Secondly , I might ask them what activity they prefer to tennis , since there are so many other possibilities .
Sparks :
The emotions you ’re able to display during the game – “ the joy and frustration at winning or losing ” you ’ve mentioned before – do you feel those human responses help your clients better connect with you ?
Treitler : Yes I do .
I was never a big fan of hierarchical divisions between client and therapist .
This type of treatment breaks that down and allows the therapist to be more of himself .
For example , during a recent Tennis Therapy session , I became frustrated when I was n’t playing well and my client could see that on the court .
A therapist does n’t have to be “ emotionless ” , on the court or off .
He also saw me pull it together and raise the level of my game later in the match , so I was able to model “ anger management ” and an ability to control my frustration and negativity .
Sparks :
For children , how important do you feel it is to have sports programs available in the schools and communities ?
Why ?
Treitler : I think it is very important .
For example , I work in a unique program that blends literacy with tennis for middle - schoolers .
It is extremely effective and has been shown to not only keep kids off the streets , but to get them into better high schools and perform better in school .
I have always benefited from sports programs growing up in New York City and in New Jersey .
It helped me get through some very difficult times , including my parents divorce .
Sparks :
Thanks so much for your time , Felix – I wish you the best of luck with your practice !
Treitler :
Thank you so much for expressing an interest in this new form of Therapy .
This is exactly the kind of exposure that will be so helpful in getting the word out to as many people as possible .
I am open to people contacting me through my email , ftnyc2@gmail.com or by phone at ( 781 ) 888-4067 .
Therapist Interview : Felix Treitler Leaves the Couch Behind
A Melbourne , Florida woman thought she was helping out a severely disabled man by feeding him and changing his diapers for three months , but it turns out she may have just been catering to a weird guy 's baby fetish .
Janet Schulte was hired through Craigslist to care for a man 's adult brother with a diminished mental capacity in exchange for $ 600 dollars per week .
Schulte bottle - fed the man and changed his adult diapers for several weeks , but always gave an excuse when she asked to meet his brother who had hired her .
But when payments started coming in late , Schulte and her husband became suspicious , and after looking into the matter , figured out the disabled man and his brother were the same person .
The worst part for Schulte is that even though the man lied , he did n't technically commit a crime , so he can't be charged .
It was n't the first time the man sought out special care .
He was convicted of felony fraud in 2006 for getting emergency room care under assumed names , according to floridatoday.com .
Ferrari are apparently looking to Formula
Two race winner Mirko Bortolotti to take over Felipe Massa 's seat after the next race at Spa - Franchorchamps .
Although Luca Badoer will be racing for the team at the next race , it is widely speculated that he will be dropped after a lacklustre Ferrari debut at Valencia
The 19 - year - old Italian has previously tested for Ferrari and reportedly impressed Ferrari Chairman Luca di Montezemolo setting an unofficial lap record of 59.111s around the Fiorano test track , eclipsing previous times of Kimi Raikkonen , Luca Badoer and Marc Gene .
Bortolotti is n't being drawn into the speculation at the moment though .
“ All I can say is that I 'm racing in F2 and I 'm not thinking about anything other than the championship .
I want to be higher than sixth , so I have to work hard and apply myself 100 % .
There is still enough time to improve , so if I can get the best possible results hopefully I can move up the order again . ”
“ There has been quite a lot of speculation in Italy surrounding the Ferrari seat .
To be honest I think Luca ( Badoer ) just needs a bit more time to get a feeling for the car .
Everything has changed since he last raced , but I 'm sure he will be quicker at Spa as the pace is there in the car .
As for me , I 'm just focusing on Formula Two .
It 's nice to be linked with the team , but my mentality is just to do a good job in Formula
Two for the remaining three rounds – after that , I 'll start thinking about my future . ”
Bortolotti joined the Red Bull Junior Team at the beginning of 2009 after a superb season in Italian F3 and has gone on to secure his maiden victory and 2 further podiums .
The next round of the FIA Formula Two Championship will take place in Oschersleben , Germany , on 4 - 6 September .

CATCHWORDS
Lane v Morrison
Constitutional law ( Cth ) – Judicial power of the Commonwealth – Military courts – Member of Australian Defence Force charged under Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 ( Cth ) ( " Act " ) – Where hearing before Australian Military Court ( " AMC " ) , established by s 114 of Act – Where AMC a court of record and decision subject to appeal to tribunal – Relevance of fact that AMC has criminal jurisdiction – Whether AMC exercising judicial power of the Commonwealth – Whether AMC created in accordance with Ch III of Constitution .
Constitutional law ( Cth ) – Defence power – Military courts – AMC independent from command structure – Whether creation of AMC beyond the scope of s 51 ( vi ) of Constitution – Whether creation of AMC inconsistent with power vested in Governor - General by s 68 of Constitution .
Words and phrases – " command structure " , " court " , " court of record " , " courts - martial " , " judicial power " , " judicial power of the Commonwealth " , " service tribunal " .
" (1 ) A court , to be known as the Australian Military Court , is created by this Act .
Note 1 : The Australian Military Court is not a court for the purposes of Chapter III of the Constitution .
Note 2 : The Australian Military Court is a service tribunal for the purposes of this Act : see the definition of service tribunal in subsection 3 ( 1 ) .
( 1A ) The Australian Military Court is a court of record .
(2) The Australian Military Court consists of :
( a ) the Chief Military Judge ; and
( b ) such other Military Judges as from time to time hold office in accordance with this Act . "
The significance of the classification of the AMC as a " service tribunal " is discussed later in these reasons [ 4 ] s 115 to try certain charges of offences against the Act or the regulations made under it and , by virtue of the 2008 Act , to hear and determine certain " appeals " from decisions of " summary authorities " , including commanding officers .
The AMC is to have a seal ( s 119 ) .
It may sit at any place in or outside Australia ( s 117 ) and is constituted by a single Military Judge ( s 116 ) .
Provision is made outside Div 3 of Pt VII for the hearing in public of the proceedings of the AMC , subject to restrictions respecting the interests of the security and defence of Australia and " the proper administration of justice or public morals " ( s 140 ) .
The office of Registrar of the AMC is established by s 188 F .
Military Judges are appointed by the Governor - General by written instrument , for a term of 10 years ( s 188AP ) .
Appointments may be terminated by the Governor - General for cause ( s 188 AZ ( 1 ) ) .
The appointment of a Military Judge comes to an end if the appointee ceases to be a member of the Defence Force ( s 188 AZ ( 2 ) ) .
The plaintiff seeks prohibition to restrain the first defendant from trying the charges laid against him and declaratory relief , including a declaration that the central provisions made by the 2006 Act and included as Div 3 of Pt VII of the Act are invalid .
The first defendant entered a submitting appearance .
The Commonwealth is the second defendant .
The Attorney - General for Western Australia intervened in support of the plaintiff .
The Commonwealth has accepted that the relevant date for the determination of the question of validity is 1 October 2007 and submissions by both sides were directed to the legislation as it stood on that date .
If the plaintiff 's case be made out , it will be unnecessary to consider the amendments respecting the AMC made by the 2008 Act .
The plaintiff should have prohibition and a declaration of the invalidity of Div 3 of Pt VII .
Outline
In outline , the reasons for that conclusion are as follows .
The judicial power identified in Ch III is that of a body politic , namely the Commonwealth , which is distinct from that of the States and , given the presence of s 74 , that of the United Kingdom .
The powers of the Parliament to create courts are found only in ss 71 , 72 and 122 of the Constitution [ 5 ] s 122 as a law with respect to the government of any territory .
Nor is the AMC comprised of Justices who are appointed by the Governor - General in Council and with the tenure provided by s 72 of the Constitution .
Further , however , the jurisdiction conferred upon the AMC by s 115 of the Act , to try charges of service offences , involves the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth otherwise than in accordance with Ch III of the Constitution .
Legislation conferring that jurisdiction is consistent with the Constitution only if the changes introduced by the 2006 Act , including the establishment of the AMC , are supported by s 51 ( vi ) of the Constitution .
But the special position of military justice , which is given by the defence power , is confined to that which , as a matter of history , answers the description given by Dixon J in R v Cox ; Ex parte Smith [ 6 ]
Constitution , his Honour stated that the exception was " not real " and continued :
" To ensure that discipline is just , tribunals acting judicially are essential to the organization of an army or navy or air force .
But they do not form part of the judicial system administering the law of the land . "
The validity of the system of military justice established by the Act , as it stood before the introduction of the AMC by the 2006 Act , was upheld in White v Director of Military Prosecutions [ 7 ]
2006 Act , as the explanatory materials emphasise in considerable detail , was designed to supersede , and improve upon , that system with one more nearly approaching , but stopping short of , the Ch III paradigm .
There was an attempt by the Parliament to borrow for the AMC the reputation of the judicial branch of government for impartiality and non-partisanship , upon which its legitimacy has been said , in this Court , ultimately to depend [ 8 ] [ 9 ] travaux preparatoires that this would be a risky endeavour by the Parliament .
And , in the event , the 2006 Act took the AMC beyond what is authorised by s 51 ( vi ) of the Constitution .
The description of the military justice system given by Dixon J in Cox was adopted in White v Director of Military Prosecutions [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
" directed to the maintenance of the defining characteristic of armed forces as disciplined forces organised hierarchically " .
Within that command structure , and in contrast to the operation of the civilian justice system , the sentences of courts - martial required confirmation by a superior officer and that confirmation in turn might be quashed upon petition to higher levels of the chain of command .
In 1997 this characteristic of the British military justice system was held in Findlay v United Kingdom [ 14 ] 2006
Act established the AMC outside the previous command structure and evinced a legislative design to meet the concerns which had underpinned the decision in Findlay .
But in doing so , the Parliament exceeded the exercise of power conferred by s 51 ( vi ) .
We turn to develop the above outline of reasons .
The explanatory materials
In June 2005 the Foreign Affairs , Defence and Trade References Committee of the Senate delivered its Report titled The effectiveness of Australia 's military justice system ( " the 2005 Senate Report " ) .
The Committee stated ( par 5.79 ) :
" It is becoming increasingly apparent that Australia 's disciplinary system is not striking the right balance between the requirements of a functional Defence Force and the rights of Service personnel , to the detriment of both .
Twenty years since the introduction of the [ 1982 Act ] , the time has come to address seriously the overall viability of the system .
Australian judicial decisions and the evidence before this committee suggest the discipline system is becoming unworkable and potentially open to challenge on constitutional grounds .
Overseas jurisprudence and developments suggest that alternative approaches may be more effective . "
Findlay had concerned the court - martial procedures under the Army Act 1955 ( UK ) ( " the 1955 UK Act " ) and in Grieves v United Kingdom [ 15 ]
Naval Discipline Act 1957 ( UK ) ( " the 1957 UK Act " ) .
In Canada , the Supreme Court held in R v Généreux [ 16 ] National Defence Act ( Can ) [ 17 ] Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
Remedial legislation had followed in both the United Kingdom and Canada .
Article 14 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( " the ICCPR " ) is in similar terms to the provisions applied in Findlay , Grieves and Généreux , and the 2005 Senate Report emphasised that Australia is a signatory to the ICCPR .
Recommendations 18 and 19 in the 2005 Senate Report were that a permanent military court be created in accordance with Ch III of the Constitution " to ensure its independence and impartiality " and that it be capable of trying offences currently tried under the 1982 Act by a court - martial or a Defence Force magistrate .
The Government Response issued in October 2005 rejected the creation of a permanent military court under Ch III of the Constitution on grounds that Ch III imposed " real constraints " upon an effective military justice system .
The Response continued :
" The limitations resulting from those constraints means that having a separate military court outside Chapter III is preferable to bringing the military justice system into line with Chapter III requirements .
The Government will instead establish a permanent military court , to be known as the Australian military court , to replace the current system of individually convened trials by Courts Martial and Defence Force Magistrates .
The Australian military court would be established under appropriate Defence legislation and would satisfy the principles of impartiality and judicial independence through the statutory appointment of military judge advocates by the Minister for Defence , with security of tenure ( fixed five - year terms with possible renewal of five years ) and remuneration set by the Remuneration Tribunal ( Cth ) .
To enhance the independence of military judge advocates outside the chain of command , they would not be eligible for promotion during the period of their appointment .
Advice to the Government indicates that a military court outside Chapter III would be valid provided jurisdiction is only exercised under the military system where proceedings can reasonably be regarded as substantially serving the purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline . "
Clause 114 of the Bill for the 2006 Act as introduced into the House of Representatives did not include sub-cl ( 1A ) , which classifies the AMC as " a court of record " .
The sub-clause was included as an amendment moved by the Government after a Report on the Bill to the Senate by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs , Defence and Trade ( " the 2006 Report " ) .
The Committee determined " that the proposed AMC would not achieve the level of independence and impartiality needed to ensure a fair and effective military justice system " ( par 1.27 ) .
The Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum on the revised Bill stated that the new sub-cl ( 1A ) " further enhances the status of the AMC " ( par 13 ) ; it also said ( par 12 ) :
" Courts martial and trials by Defence Force magistrates were not designated as ' courts of record ' under the [ 1982 Act ] .
Consistent with this , the AMC was not specifically made a court of record because there was no legal or practical reason for doing so .
Additionally , it avoided conferring the characteristics of a civilian court ( with greater jurisdiction ) on the AMC .
Notwithstanding this , the functional attributes of a court of record are provided for in the Bill , including the capacity to deal with contempt of the court , conduct of proceedings in public , and a requirement to record proceedings .
The AMC has now been accorded the status of a court of record , noting that there will be a provision to limit publication of proceedings in the interests of the security and defence of Australia or for particularly sensitive matters . "
As explained later in these reasons , the presence of s 114 ( 1A ) emphasises , but is not the sole indication of , a legislative intention to create a body with the character of a Ch III court , save for the manner of appointment and tenure of the Military Judges .
It would be a denial of that legislative intention to read down s 114 by excising sub-s ( 1A ) pursuant to s 15A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 ( Cth ) [ 18 ]
Courts and the Constitution
The noun " court " is used in varied contexts and in many senses .
The Oxford English Dictionary [ 19 ] [ 20 ]
" ' Court ' as the name of a place is merely a secondary meaning .
' The Court ' is the deciding and enforcing authority , even if it sits under a tree , as sometimes it does in parts of the British Empire . "
Hence the statement by McHugh JA in Australian Postal Commission v Dao ( No 2 ) [ 21 ]
" In ordinary usage the word ' court ' has many meanings : they range from the group who form the retinue of a sovereign to an area used to play certain ball games .
Legal usage also gives the word several meanings .
Thus a ' court ' may refer to a body exercising judicial power as in the Constitution , Ch III , or to a body exercising non-judicial power such as the Coroners Court or to a court of petty sessions hearing committal proceedings .
It may even refer to a body exercising judicial and arbitral powers such as the former Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration or the Queensland Industrial Court . "
" Had there been no Chap III in the Constitution it may be supposed that some at least of the legislative powers would have been construed as extending to the creation of courts with jurisdictions appropriate to the subject matter of the power .
This could hardly have been otherwise with the powers in respect of bankruptcy and insolvency ( s 51 ( xvii ) ) and with respect to divorce and matrimonial causes ( s 51 ( xxii ) ) .
The legislature would then have been under no limitations as to the tribunals to be set up or the tenure of the judicial officers by whom they might be constituted .
But the existence in the Constitution of Chap III and the nature of the provisions it contains make it clear that no resort can be made to judicial power except under or in conformity with ss 71 - 80 . "
In its written submissions the Commonwealth contended in general terms that the replacement of the court - martial system by the AMC was but a " modernization " of terminology and was not a matter of substance .
The Parliament , it was said , in reliance upon legislative powers outside ss 71 and 72 of the Constitution might create a body styled as a " court " and displaying some features commonly associated with courts , provided only that the body " does not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth " .
This submission appeared to lay the ground in Australia for a system of " legislative courts " resembling the United States model .
Any such submission should be rejected .
It cannot stand with the statement of general principle in the passage from the Boilermakers '
Case set out above .
In his oral submissions the Solicitor - General correctly disclaimed the existence of any general power in the Parliament to create legislative courts .
Rather , he stressed the special position occupied by the defence power as the basis for the creation of the AMC .
The provisions of the 2006 Act indicate a legislative intention to create a body with the character of a court created by the Parliament under Ch III of the Constitution , save for the manner of appointment and tenure of its members .
That intention is emphasised by the statement in s 114 ( 1A ) of the Act that the AMC is " a court of record " .
Such a court has two relevant attributes .
First , a court of record which is not created as a superior court nevertheless has the power to punish for contempt committed in the face of the court [ 34 ]
R v Taylor ; Ex parte Roach [ 35 ]
" By definition contempt is confined as an offence to courses of conduct prejudicial to the judicial power and does not extend to impairments of other forms of authority .
Obstructions to the exercise of executive power , administrative power , legislative power or other governmental power are not within the conception of the offence of contempt of court . "
Secondly , the proceedings of a court of record preserved in its archives are called records , and are conclusive evidence of that which is recorded therein [ 36 ] Waterside Workers ' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd [ 37 ]
The conclusive evidentiary character of the records of the AMC , otherwise flowing from its creation as a court of record , must be understood in the light of s 191 of the Act .
This treats certain certificates setting out facts respecting AMC proceedings as prima facie evidence in any civil court .
The result is that s 191 assists the operation of s 114 ( 1A ) .
The record is conclusive but the presence of a certificate relieves the need to prove by other means the content of the record .
However , the Act must be read with changes made by the 2006 Act to the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 ( Cth ) ( " the Appeals Act " ) .
The result is the subjection of the AMC by s 20 of the Appeals Act to " appeals " brought to the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal ( " the Appeal Tribunal " ) , but only by leave where the ground is not a question of law .
The Appeal Tribunal is not created as a court [ 38 ] Constitution [ 39 ] s 73 ( ii ) which provides for the appellate jurisdiction of this Court .
The upshot is that while the Parliament has given to the AMC some of the attributes of a court which may be created by the Parliament for the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth , it has not created such a body .
Indeed , Note 1 to s 114 and the legislative history indicate that the 2006
Act was not designed to achieve that outcome .
The issues
The issues which then arise may be stated as follows .
First , does the 2006 Act , in providing for the creation of the AMC , answer the description of a law with respect to military justice which may be supported under the special provision made by the defence power in s 51 ( vi ) of the Constitution ?
The plaintiff and Western Australia submit that the 2006
Act goes beyond what as a matter of history was encompassed by the administration of military justice by a hierarchical command structure .
The second issue is related to the first and asks whether the power conferred on the Parliament by s 51 ( vi ) of the Constitution extends to the identification of the AMC as a " Court " , albeit not a court answering , as a matter of its formation and constitution , the character of a court created by the Parliament under ss 71 and 72 of the Constitution .
Command structure
Judicial power
In Grant v Gould [ 45 ]
" Naval Courts Martial , Military Courts Martial , Courts of Admiralty , Courts of Prize , are all liable to the controlling authority , which the Courts of Westminster Hall have from time to time exercised , for the purpose of preventing them from exceeding the jurisdiction given to them : the general ground of prohibition being an excess of jurisdiction , when they assume a power to act in matters not within their cognizance . "
That reasoning was applicable to the jurisdiction of this Court established by s 75 ( v ) of the Constitution .
However , in England the reasons of Atkin LJ in R v Electricity Commissioners ; Ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co ( 1920 ) Ltd [ 46 ] Kioa v West [ 47 ]
" was to focus attention on those elements in the making of administrative decisions which are analogous to judicial determination as a means of determining whether the rules of natural justice apply in a particular case .
The emphasis given in subsequent decisions to the presence and absence of these characteristics diverted attention from the need to insist on the adoption in the administrative process of fair and flexible procedures for decision - making , procedures which do not necessarily take curial procedures as their model . "
Thereafter , in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [ 48 ]
" There was a time when it was customary to refer to the duty of a non-curial statutory decision - maker to observe common law requirements of fairness and detachment in certain circumstances as a ' duty to act judicially ' ( see , eg , Testro Bros Pty Ltd v Tait [ 49 ]
Board of Education v Rice [ 50 ] R v Electricity Commissioners [ 51 ]
Local Government Board v Arlidge [ 52 ]
O'Reilly v Mackman [ 53 ]
The treatment of the jurisdiction conferred by s 75 ( v ) of the Constitution with respect to prohibition directed to officers of the Commonwealth constituting military tribunals appears to have been influenced in the way described by Mason J and by Deane J.
It may explain the frame of mind in which statements have been made , notably by Starke J in R v Bevan ; Ex parte Elias and Gordon [ 54 ] s 71 , they did exercise " judicial power " .
But the only judicial power which the Constitution recognises is that exercised by the branch of government identified in Ch III .
The 2006 Act
The plaintiff 's submissions
The primary submission by the plaintiff emphasised the importance of the hierarchical command structure to the system of military justice derived from that in the United Kingdom at the time of federation in Australia .
But this supplied the starting point for an argument based upon alleged incompatibility between the 2006 Act and s 68 of the Constitution .
Section 68 states :
" The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor - General as the Queen 's representative . "
The reference to the naval and military forces " of the Commonwealth " had , in 1900 and for some time thereafter , a particular significance in the scheme of Imperial naval defence [ 56 ]
Constitution , by special provision in covering cl 5 , was not in force on those British ships which were the Queen 's ships of war even if their first port of clearance or port of destination was in Australia .
The plaintiff seeks to make good a different point .
He refers to other provisions in the Constitution , particularly the appointment and delegation provisions in ss 64 , 67 and 72 and the temporary expenditure provision in s 83 .
These refer to the Governor - General in Council , an expression which bespeaks action upon advice of the Federal Executive Council .
Section 63 makes this plain .
Section 68 refers to the Governor - General , without more .
The plaintiff submits ( a ) that s 68 vests in the Governor - General the prerogative power of the Crown as understood in the United Kingdom to maintain disciplined military forces and ( b ) that the power of command is beyond impairment by the legislation establishing the AMC , with the result that s 51 ( vi ) does not support the 2006 Act .
The first proposition is an incomplete statement of the effect of the Constitution .
At the third session of the Federal Convention at Melbourne in 1898 , Mr Deakin unsuccessfully sought to add to the draft s 68 a requirement that the Governor - General act under the advice of the Federal Executive Council [ 57 ] [ 58 ]
It is true that another delegate , Mr Lewis MHA of Tasmania , said that nothing could be more subversive of discipline than for the power to review the decisions of courts - martial to be exercised upon ministerial advice [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]
" The command - in - chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is , in accordance with constitutional usage , vested in the Governor - General as the Queen 's Representative .
This is one of the oldest and most honoured prerogatives of the Crown , but it is now exercised in a constitutional manner .
The Governor - General could not wield more authority in the naval and military business of the country than he could in the routine work of any other local department .
Of what use would be the command without the grant of the supplies necessary for its execution ?
All matters , therefore , relating to the disposition and management of the federal forces will be regulated by the Governor - General with the advice of his Ministry having the confidence of Parliament . "
Hence the statement by Mr O'Connor [ 62 ] s 68 speaks is nominal in the sense that it is placed within the system of responsible government , as well understood at the time of the debate in the Convention .
Once that is understood there is no ground remaining for the second proposition by the plaintiff .
The exercise of that command may be the subject of legislation supported by s 51 ( vi ) of the Constitution .
Indeed , the legislative structures for review in disciplinary matters created in the United Kingdom by the 1866 Act and the 1881 Act and then in Australia by the 1903 Act and the 1982 Act diminished the scope for the political interference , the fear of which appears to have moved Mr Lewis in the Convention debate .
There remains the secondary , but more substantial , submission that the 2006
Act in creating the AMC apart from the command structure described earlier in these reasons , and in thereby purporting to provide for its exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth , can not be sustained by s 51 ( vi ) .
It is upon this ground that the case falls for decision .
Conclusions
In oral submissions the Commonwealth Solicitor - General agreed that it was fundamental to the case for validity of the legislation under challenge that it did not place the AMC beyond the " historical stream " of the previous systems of military justice .
The difficulty with the case for validity is that the AMC was designed to make a break with that past and the analysis of the 2006
Act earlier in these reasons shows that the Parliament achieved its objective .
It was the presence of some characteristics of that " historical stream " which exposed the legislation in the United Kingdom and Canada to the successful attacks made in Findlay , Grieves and Généreux .
Once it was decided to deal with the 1982 Act not by the creation of a Ch III court but by the creation of the AMC , the 2006 Act became vulnerable to the attack now successfully made upon the validity of the AMC .
The power conferred by s 51 ( vi ) does not extend to the creation of a " legislative court " , in the sense discussed in these reasons , which operates outside the previous system of military justice .
It therefore is unnecessary to deal , save in one respect , with the further arguments presented by the plaintiff .
It was submitted that the power conferred by s 51 ( vi ) was limited to the punishment of crimes such as those charged here which were committed on active service ( not this case ) or in the circumstances and places where the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts could not conveniently be exercised [ 63 ]
White v Director of Military Prosecutions [ 64 ]
Orders
Upon the further amended application for an order to show cause , referred by the Chief Justice to the Full Court by order made 16 January 2009 , there should be , pursuant to r 25.03.4 of the High Court Rules 2004 , an order for a writ of prohibition directed to the first defendant .
This should prohibit him from trying the charges against the plaintiff identified in par 17 of the agreed statement of facts dated 16 January 2009 .
There should also be a declaration that Div 3 of Pt VII of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 ( Cth ) is invalid .
The plaintiff should have against the second defendant his costs in the cause .
HAYNE , HEYDON , CRENNAN , KIEFEL AND BELL JJ .
Section 114 of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 ( Cth ) ( " the DFDA " ) creates a court : the Australian Military Court ( " the AMC " ) .
It is a court of record [ 65 ] s 71 of the Constitution in which the judicial power of the Commonwealth is vested .
The AMC is not a court whose judges are appointed in the manner , or have the tenure and the security of remuneration , required by s 72 of the Constitution .
The determinative issue in this matter is whether the DFDA provides for the AMC , a court not created in accordance with Ch III of the Constitution , to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
The proceedings
The plaintiff has been charged with offences allegedly committed when he was a member of the Permanent Navy , and thus a " defence member " [ 66 ]
Pt VII of the DFDA ( ss 114 - 121 ) are invalid .
The first defendant filed a submitting appearance .
The plaintiff and the Commonwealth having agreed in a statement of agreed facts , the proceedings were referred for hearing by the Full Court .
The Attorney - General for Western Australia intervened in support of the plaintiff .
The plaintiff put his claim that the legislation creating the AMC is invalid on several different bases .
It is convenient to deal first with the argument that Div 3 of Pt VII of the DFDA is invalid because it provides for the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by a body not created in accordance with Ch III of the Constitution .
In connection with that argument , the plaintiff relied on amendments made to the DFDA by the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 2008 ( Cth ) ( " the 2008 Amendment Act " ) providing for the AMC to hear " appeals " from the decisions of summary authorities made under the DFDA .
The amendments made by the 2008 Amendment
Act do not apply to the proceedings against the plaintiff .
Not only would the provisions to which the plaintiff points not be engaged , the transitional provisions of the 2008 Amendment Act provide [ 67 ]
2008 Amendment Act , is to apply in relation to proceedings which had been commenced under the earlier form of the legislation .
The proceedings brought against the plaintiff had been commenced under the earlier form of the legislation .
It is not necessary to decide when they were commenced but that had happened by November 2007 when they were referred for trial by the AMC .
It is , therefore , neither necessary nor appropriate to have regard in this matter to the amendments made by the 2008 Amendment Act .
These reasons are directed to the validity of the relevant provisions of the DFDA ( Div 3 of Pt VII ) as those provisions stood before the commencement of the 2008 Amendment Act .
Section 114 provides :
" (1 ) A court , to be known as the Australian Military Court , is created by this Act .
Note 1 : The Australian Military Court is not a court for the purposes of Chapter III of the Constitution .
Note 2 : The Australian Military Court is a service tribunal for the purposes of this Act : see the definition of service tribunal in subsection 3 ( 1 ) .
( 1A ) The Australian Military Court is a court of record .
(2) The Australian Military Court consists of :
( a ) the Chief Military Judge ; and
( b ) such other Military Judges as from time to time hold office in accordance with this Act . "
It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the provisions of Div 3 of Pt VII , apart from s 114 , are s 115 ( dealing with the jurisdiction of the AMC ) , s 116 ( providing for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the AMC ) , s 117 ( providing that the AMC may sit in or outside Australia ) , s 118 ( concerning the referral of charges to the AMC and nomination of a Military Judge to try a charge ) , s 119 ( providing for the seal of the AMC ) , s 120 ( providing for an AMC stamp ) and s 121 ( providing for staff necessary to assist the AMC ) .
The history of the legislation
The provisions of Div 3 of Pt VII were introduced into the DFDA by the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 2006 ( Cth ) ( " the 2006 Amendment Act " ) .
The 2006 Amendment Act was enacted after a lengthy inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs , Defence and Trade References Committee into the effectiveness of the Australian military justice system in providing " impartial , rigorous and fair outcomes , and mechanisms to improve the transparency and public accountability of military justice procedures " [ 68 ]
In its report , the Committee noted [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ]
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
The 2005 Senate Committee Report recommended changes in the military justice system .
In particular , it recommended [ 77 ]
Constitution to ensure its independence and impartiality .
The Government published a written response to the 2005 Senate Committee Report .
In that response the Government agreed [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ]
Both the Government Response [ 81 ]
Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 ( Cth ) [ 82 ] and independence from the chain of command in matters of military discipline .
As will later be demonstrated , it is the independence of the AMC from the chain of command which is the chief feature distinguishing it from earlier forms of service tribunal which have been held not to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
Accepted doctrine
It is as well to begin consideration of the issues that arise in this matter by restating an undisputed constitutional principle .
In R v Kirby ; Ex parte Boilermakers ' Society of Australia ( " the Boilermakers ' Case " ) it was held [ 83 ]
" Had there been no Chap III in the Constitution it may be supposed that some at least of the legislative powers would have been construed as extending to the creation of courts with jurisdictions appropriate to the subject matter of the power .
This could hardly have been otherwise with the powers in respect of bankruptcy and insolvency ( s 51 ( xvii ) ) and with respect to divorce and matrimonial causes ( s 51 ( xxii ) ) .
The legislature would then have been under no limitations as to the tribunals to be set up or the tenure of the judicial officers by whom they might be constituted .
But the existence in the Constitution of Chap III and the nature of the provisions it contains make it clear that no resort can be made to judicial power except under or in conformity with ss 71 - 80 .
An exercise of a legislative power may be such that ' matters ' fit for the judicial process may arise under the law that is made .
In virtue of that character , that is to say because they are matters arising under a law of the Commonwealth , they belong to federal judicial power .
But they can be dealt with in federal jurisdiction only as the result of a law made in the exercise of the power conferred on the Parliament by s 76 ( ii ) or that provision considered with s 71 and s 77 . " ( emphasis added )
The Commonwealth submissions
The Commonwealth submitted that s 114 , and the other provisions of Div 3 of Pt VII of the DFDA , are made under s 51 ( vi ) as a law with respect to " the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States " .
The Commonwealth submitted that the AMC is not a court encompassed by the phrase , in s 71 of the Constitution , " such other federal courts as the Parliament creates " .
The Commonwealth noted , correctly , that since long before Federation , tribunals acting judicially have been seen as essential to the organisation of an army , navy or air force [ 84 ] [ 85 ]
The Commonwealth sought to develop its argument by describing the functions performed by courts - martial as an exercise of " judicial power " which was not the exercise of the " judicial power of the Commonwealth " .
In this connection the Commonwealth referred to dicta [ 86 ]
As noted earlier , the AMC was intended to differ from earlier forms of service tribunal .
It is independent from the chain of command .
That independence is critical to the decision whether the AMC is to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
To explain the nature and extent of the changes made by the 2006 Amendment
Act it is necessary to say something about courts - martial , and then compare the AMC with those earlier institutions and associated arrangements for service discipline .
Courts - martial
The AMC
The Bill for the 2006 Amendment Act , which among other things was to create the AMC , was intended to give effect to the Government Response to the 2005 Senate Committee Report .
The provisions of the Bill for the 2006 Amendment Act were considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs , Defence and Trade .
The report [ 121 ]
Although the 2006 Senate Committee considered [ 122 ] [ 123 ]
At least since the enactment of the Imperial Naval Discipline Act and Army Act , courts - martial of members of the forces subject to naval or military discipline were conducted according to procedures generally analogous to those followed by the civil courts .
Courts - martial pronounced verdicts of guilt or innocence of offences , some of which were or were analogous to offences against the general criminal law .
The punishments awarded by courts - martial included forms of punishment provided by the general criminal law .
It is , then , not surprising that it has been said that courts - martial exercised a form of judicial power .
Such an observation , however , is not helpful in the resolution of the issue that arises in this case .
First , on analysis the observation may go no further than asserting that courts - martial act judicially [ 124 ]
Constitution is whether the body under consideration exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
To speak of a court - martial exercising a species of judicial power is unhelpful if it distracts attention from the relevant constitutional question .
That constitutional question was resolved in respect of courts - martial , as it was in R v Bevan , R v Cox and later Re Tracey , at a time when courts - martial were not independent of the chain of command of the forces .
Courts - martial were convened only by order from within the chain of command ; conclusions of guilt and determinations of punishment were subject to review or confirmation within that chain of command .
A court - martial did not make a binding and authoritative decision of guilt or determination of punishment [ 125 ] [ 126 ]
That the AMC is to make binding and authoritative decisions on the issues identified without further intervention from within the chain of command is reason enough to conclude that it is to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
It is , however , desirable to notice two further aspects of the amendments made by the 2006 Amendment Act , both of which relate to s 114 ( 1A ) , providing that the AMC is a court of record .
A court of record
The plaintiff submitted , and the Commonwealth disputed , that because the AMC is created as a court and as a court of record , it exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
Particular attention was given in this connection to what power the AMC has to deal with that species of contempt referred to as contempt in the face of the court .
The plaintiff submitted that the AMC has that power because it is a court of record , and that having that power demonstrates that the AMC exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
The Commonwealth submitted that courts - martial had always had power not substantially different from a court of record 's power to deal with contempt in the face of the court , at least in respect of persons subject to naval or military law [ 127 ]
It is not necessary to resolve this aspect of the debate between the parties .
Designation of a body created by a law of the Parliament as a " court of record " may not , without more , show that it exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth [ 128 ]
The legislative history of s 114 ( 1A )
As originally introduced , the Bill for the 2006 Amendment Act did not include the provision that would become s 114 ( 1A ) .
The 2006 Senate Committee recommended [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ]
As the Committee 's written questions on notice to the Department of Defence showed [ 133 ] [ 134 ]
" there is no sensible reason why the AMC should not expressly be made a court of record and making it so would put beyond doubt its status as a court and its judicial authority " .
( emphasis added )
The Department of Defence 's response to the Committee 's question about this aspect of the Bill was [ 135 ] [ 136 ]
" The concept [ of court of record ] has meaning in connection with the civilian court system .
The AMC is not part of that system and should not be conferred with a status that might be taken to suggest that it is ( or that it has a similar jurisdiction ) .
There is no reason to expand the use of the concept in relation to the AMC , which is a unique statutory creature .
Its powers should generally be set out in its enabling legislation and not determined by reference to powers exercised by courts in the civilian system .
The statutory status of the proposed AMC and its judicial authority is clear .
The status of ' court of record ' is also not required to establish the independence or impartiality of the proposed AMC . "
Nonetheless , the Bill for the 2006 Amendment Act was amended to provide , by the insertion of what was to become s 114 ( 1A ) , that the AMC was to be a court of record .
The Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum and Corrigendum to the Original Explanatory Memorandum circulated in respect of the Bill for the 2006 Amendment Act said of this provision :
" 11 .
A court of record is a court that is declared by an Act to be so or a court that has the power to impose a fine or imprisonment for contempt against it or for another substantive offence ( contempt includes disturbance of proceedings , interference with the authority of the court or publication of material which may prejudice its proceedings ) .
12 . Courts martial and trials by Defence Force magistrates were not designated as ' courts of record ' under the DFDA .
Consistent with this , the AMC was not specifically made a court of record because there was no legal or practical reason for doing so .
Additionally , it avoided conferring the characteristics of a civilian court ( with greater jurisdiction ) on the AMC .
Notwithstanding this , the functional attributes of a court of record are provided for in the Bill , including the capacity to deal with contempt of the court , conduct of proceedings in public , and a requirement to record proceedings .
The AMC has now been accorded the status of a court of record , noting that there will be a provision to limit publication of proceedings in the interests of the security and defence of Australia or for particularly sensitive matters .
13 . Paragraph ( 8 ) will reinforce the provisions discussed in paragraphs 11 to 12 by inserting new subclause 114 ( 1A ) , to provide that the AMC is a ' court of record ' .
It will reinforce existing provisions in the DFDA which will require the public publication of AMC records except where it would be inappropriate to do so ( for example , if it would be contrary to the interests of the security or defence of Australia , the proper administration of justice or public morals ) .
These examples currently apply to the conduct of public hearings .
This amendment further enhances the status of the AMC . " ( emphasis added )
That is , the inclusion in the Bill of what was to become s 114 ( 1A ) , providing that the AMC is a court of record , was seen as reinforcing what was already provided in the Bill .
Without this provision the Bill was understood to provide for the AMC to have " the functional attributes of a court of record " : it was to have capacity to deal with contempt of court , was to conduct its proceedings in public , and was to be required to record its proceedings .
The amendment inserting what was to become s 114 ( 1A ) in the Bill was treated in the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum as directed to " enhanc[ing ] the status of the AMC " , but appeared not to be intended to effect any substantive change in the nature of the body that was to be created .
There is , however , a consequence of creating the AMC as a court of record which goes beyond the questions of status and contempt powers .
That consequence depends upon the AMC both having power to make binding and authoritative determinations of guilt and being designated a court of record .
It is necessary to examine further the kinds of issues which the DFDA , as amended by the 2006 Amendment Act , provides for the AMC to decide , and the final and binding nature of those decisions .
The decisions which the AMC is to make include decisions about guilt of offences against the general criminal law .
Section 115 ( 1 ) of the DFDA , as amended by the 2006 Amendment Act , provides that :
" Subject to section 63 , the Australian Military Court has jurisdiction to try any charge against any person . "
Section 115 ( 2 ) qualifies the generality of s 115 ( 1 ) by excluding from the jurisdiction of the AMC the trial of charges of certain offences committed by service personnel undergoing detention , but this qualification may be put aside from further consideration .
Section 3 ( 1 ) of the DFDA defines " charge " as " a charge of a service offence " .
Section 61 of the DFDA makes it an offence against the DFDA , and thus a " service offence " , to engage in conduct that would be an offence against a law of the Commonwealth in force in the Jervis Bay Territory , or any other law ( including any unwritten law ) in force in that Territory which creates offences or imposes criminal liability for offences [ 137 ] [ 138 ]
The qualification to the jurisdiction of the AMC provided by the reference to s 63 is not unimportant but is of limited effect .
Section 63 provides , in substance , that except with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth , proceedings under the DFDA are not to be instituted for certain identified offences including treason , murder , manslaughter , bigamy and certain sexual offences .
There remains a wide range of Territory offences that are subject to the jurisdiction of the AMC .
The offences with which the plaintiff is charged include a Territory offence that is not an offence of a kind described in s 63 .
Before the amendments made by the 2006 Amendment Act , s 190 of the DFDA provided for the jurisdiction of the civil courts in relation to service offences .
In particular , s 190 ( 1 ) provided that " [ s ] ubject to the Constitution , a civil court does not have jurisdiction to try a charge of a service offence " and s 190 ( 2 ) provided that , subject to some qualifications , " the jurisdiction of a civil court to try a charge of a civil court offence is not affected by this Act " .
As orginally enacted , sub -s ( 5 ) of s 190 provided that " [ w ] here a person has been acquitted or convicted of a service offence , the person is not liable to be tried by a civil court for a civil court offence that is substantially the same offence " .
And sub-s ( 3 ) provided that if a court - martial ( or a Defence Force magistrate ) was asked to , and did , take some other service offence into consideration when dealing with a person convicted of a service offence , the person was not liable to be tried for a civil court offence that was substantially the same offence as that taken into consideration .
Both sub-s ( 3 ) and sub-s ( 5 ) were held invalid in Re Tracey [ 139 ]
The consequence of the decision in Re Tracey was not substantially different from that which had obtained , before Federation , under the Imperial Army Act.
Section 162 of that Act had provided for what the sidenote to the section described as the " [ a ] djustment of military and civil law " by providing :
" (1 ) If a person sentenced by a court - martial in pursuance of this Act to punishment for an offence is afterwards tried by a civil court for the same offence , that court shall , in awarding punishment , have regard to the military punishment he may have already undergone .
(2) Save as aforesaid , nothing in this Act shall exempt an officer or soldier from being proceeded against by the ordinary course of law , when accused or convicted of any offence , except such an offence as is declared not to be a crime for the purpose of the provisions of this Act relating to taking a soldier out of Her Majesty 's service . "
If the impugned provisions of the DFDA are valid the " adjustment of military and civil law " is very different .
If the provisions are valid , the decision of the AMC would preclude subsequent prosecution in the civil courts for an offence substantially the same as the offence tried by the AMC .
So much would follow from the status of the AMC as a court of record .
As was said in Island Maritime Ltd v Filipowski [ 140 ]
" Just as judgment of a court of record in a civil action changes the cause of action to a matter of record [ 141 ] [ 142 ]
If the impugned provisions are valid , the AMC is given power to make a binding and authoritative determination of the issues of fact and law which are tendered on the trial of an offence the elements of which are identified by the generally applicable criminal law .
If the impugned provisions are valid , the AMC is given power to punish a person found guilty of that offence .
And , if the impugned provisions are valid , it follows from its being a court of record that the decision of the AMC would preclude further prosecution for the same offence under the generally applicable criminal law .
For the AMC to make a binding and authoritative determination of such issues pursuant to the DFDA is to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
There is no dispute that the AMC is not constituted in accordance with Ch III .
It is unprofitable to examine whether , or in what sense , it is right to describe the AMC as a " court " .
To ask whether the legislature 's use of the word is apposite invites debate about the definition of a word that has been used in diverse circumstances not always associated with the exercise of judicial power .
What is determinative of the issue in the present case is what the AMC is to do under the DFDA , as amended by the 2006 Amendment Act .
And what the AMC is to do is to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth otherwise than in accordance with Ch III .
The AMC cannot validly exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
Severance ?
The Commonwealth submitted that , if s 114 ( 1A ) making the AMC a court of record was the reason provisions creating the AMC were beyond power , s 114 ( 1A ) could readily be severed .
But as already indicated in these reasons , the provisions creating the AMC are invalid not just because the AMC is created a court of record , but because it is established to make binding and authoritative decisions of guilt or innocence independently from the chain of command of the defence forces .
It is to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
None of the provisions of Div 3 of Pt VII of the DFDA can be severed or read down in a way that would give the provisions valid operation .
The whole of Div 3 of Pt VII should be declared to be invalid .
Some additional arguments
The plaintiff submitted that the provisions creating the AMC were invalid because s 68 of the Constitution [ 143 ] s 51 ( vi ) is subject " .
The plaintiff sought , in this branch of the argument , to emphasise the extent to which the AMC stood apart from the chain of command of the forces and to contrast that with what was identified as a constitutional imperative that command of the forces be vested in the Governor - General .
As already explained , the separation of the AMC from command and the conferral on it of authority to decide issues of guilt or innocence finally is of determinative significance in considering whether the AMC exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth .
It is therefore not necessary to decide the issue raised by the plaintiff 's arguments regarding s 68 , or to explore what is entailed by vesting the command in chief of the forces in the Governor - General .
The parties also made submissions about the limits upon the exercise of the legislative power conferred by s 51 ( vi ) to proscribe and provide for the punishment of conduct outside the engagement of Ch III .
The Attorney - General for Western Australia intervened in the proceedings to make submissions on this issue .
There was therefore debate in argument about " service status " as distinct from " service connection " [ 144 ] [ 145 ]
White v Director of Military Prosecutions on these issues or to consider reopening that decision .
Conclusion and order
There should be a declaration that the provisions of Div 3 of Pt VII of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 ( Cth ) are invalid .
A writ of prohibition should issue directed to the first defendant , Colonel Peter John Morrison , a Military Judge of the Australian Military Court , prohibiting him from proceeding further with the charges relating to the plaintiff identified in the charge sheet dated 8 August 2007 and referred to the Australian Military Court for trial .
The Commonwealth should pay the plaintiff 's costs of the proceedings .

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS CONFUSED ABOUT MOON LANDING By M. Grant Winston , Managing Editor
A poll was recently taken just before the end of the past school year about the upcoming fortieth anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing .
Less than ten percent could correctly state that it happened on July 20 , 1969 .
Few more were aware that the Lunar Lander was called " The Eagle " , and only about fifteen percent could correctly name the astronauts involved .
I met a student who thought he knew about it , and even gave a presentation to his class .
He repeated the presentation for me .
Here it is .
" The Moon Landing .
Back in the hippie days of the sixties , not everyone was protesting and getting high .
We actually put two men on the moon .
That was real cool !
It was like Star Wars or Star Trek , only it was real .
They even called their ship The Enterprise .
Their names were Stretch Armstrong and Buzz Lightyear .
Here is a diarrhea , or diagramma , or whatever they are called that I made of it .
Stretch Armstrong got to go first because he was so strong and tough that all he needed was his weightlifter thong to go out there on the moon .
Buzz Lightyear had to put on his spacesuit first , so he went out second .
They collected a bunch of stuff like rocks , dirt and green cheese , and then they brought it back here .
I think we ate all the green cheese already .
When they got back to Earth , both had action figures of themselves sold in stores , but only Buzz Lightyear got to be a movie star .
The end . "
Even though I can barely begin to describe how confused this young boy is ,
His teacher told me that he came closer than any of his classmates to actually understanding what happened , and she did not want to damage his self - esteem , so she gave him an " A " .
So this is what our educational system is churning out ?
I shudder to think that today 's kids are tomorrow 's workers , and this one is a future leader .
At least he is not as stupid as the clowns who think the whole thing was a Hollywood hoax .
Though I know I am wasting my time , I will tell them this :
Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead .

NASA would stick around , but proponents of the plan see it turning into a " conduit " for tech developed outside the federal government .
WSJ : Contract winners would use corporate funds to build and test rockets , provide compatible space capsules and then try to recoup those investments by offering commercial - style transportation services to the agency .
Essentially , NASA would be paying a set fee for every pound or person transported to orbit .
This is great news for a group of mostly West Coast - based space travel startups founded by already - rich enterprenuers like Jeff Bezos , Richard Branson , Elon Musk , and John Carmack .
The Journal singles out PayPal and Tesla cofounder Elon Musk 's Space Exploration Technologies Corp -- known as SpaceX -- as a startup that stands to benefit from the shift in policy .
But there are plenty of other private - sector firms set to take advantage of the new policy , including Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic and United Launch Alliance , a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin .

In Brian Moore 's update of WWII propaganda posters , nations are brought down not by armies and guns , but by blogs and tweets .
Hang one up and show your support for net neutrality , Wikipedia , and information pirates .
In an imagined WWIII , our governments try to discourage us from blogging and tweeting , while troops are encouraged to seed their MP3s .
And I 'm sort of longing for a Rosie the Riveter poster with the subtle Reddit alien badge .

The Lib Dems say they have " held their own " in European elections despite seeing their share of the vote fall .
With all results declared except Northern Ireland , the party came in fourth with a 13.9 % share , down from 14.9 % five years ago .
It means the Lib Dems , the most pro-European of the leading UK parties , will be sending 10 MEPs to Brussels .
Leader Nick Clegg said the party was " growing fast at the expense of Labour " at local and EU level .
He said the party was now " within a hair 's breadth of Labour 's share of the vote - and they run the government " .
He described Thursday 's council election results as " very strong " and European elections results as " solid " .
The period of dominance in British politics over the last 12 years by Labour is over
Nick Clegg
Liberal Democrat leader
With the addition of one MEP to their contingent , Mr Clegg said : " Would I have liked to have done better ?
Yes , of course , but given the very volatile nature of the elections , it was a solid result . "
He said the pro-Europe party 's message of having strength in numbers " in an unsafe world " on issues such as the economy , organised crime and climate change , had been obscured by the Westminster expenses scandal .
Anger over the expenses scandal at Westminster is thought to have prompted many voters to desert the established parties , with Labour by far the worst hit .
As Labour suffered its worst election in the post - war period , Mr Clegg said : " I think Labour is finished , I think they are dying on their feet .
" The period of dominance in British politics over the last 12 years by Labour is over . "
' Hold the balance '
The UK Independence Party , the Greens and the BNP were the main beneficiaries of Labour 's collapse , the latter winning its first two seats in the European Parliament .
The Lib Dems saw their vote squeezed in several parts of UK , notably the Midlands and the North of England .
But they polled more votes in the East of England than five years ago while their vote in the South West also rose .
We should continue to hold the balance between left and right
Graham Watson MEP
The latter region is particularly important to the Lib Dems as they will be hoping to hold onto a number of seats there in the next general election against Conservative advances .
The party lost control of both Devon and Somerset councils to the Tories in Friday 's council elections .
Graham Watson MEP , Leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Brussels , said his group would continue to play an important role in the European Parliament .
" It looks as if the Liberal Democrat group will come back into the new parliament about the same size , " he said .
" That means we should continue to hold the balance between left and right . "

Dear Cecil : Several years ago there was a story going around that all the planets were going to line up on a certain date and the combined gravitational effect was going to wreak havoc on the earth , and for all I know send us crashing into the sun .
As far as I know none of this ever happened , although , come to think of it , I was inexplicably depressed in 1981 .
What 's the story on this ?
Mary S. , Baltimore
Cecil replies :
I believe you ’re referring to the " Jupiter Effect , " a scenario put forth , in a book of the same name , by a couple jokers named J.R. Gribbin and S.H. Plagemann .
Their treatise , first published back in 1974 , predicted that a " superconjunction " of planets due on March 10 , 1982 , would exert extraordinary tidal forces on the sun and ultimately trigger massive earthquakes here on Mother Earth .
The theory , which involves sunspots , climatic change , and all sorts of other unsupportable hokum , was roundly debunked in various quarters , most notably by Belgian astronomer Jean Meeus , who pointed out that during the alleged " superconjunction , " the planets would actually be spread out over a sun-centered arc of some 95 degrees .
If , for the sake of convenience , we ignore the effect of Pluto ( an eminently ignorable planet , it has always seemed to me ) , we see that the planets have occupied far smaller sections of sky before– for example , 83 degrees in 1817 , and 46 degrees in 1307 – without apparent ill effect .
Mr. Gribbin , for his part , was moved to state publicly that maybe he made a little mistake , an admission that seems to have been amply borne out by reality .

FORT BRAGG , N.C. , July 2 ( UPI ) -- A New Jersey company has developed a system to make bridges from recycled materials that are strong enough to support a U.S. Army tank .
Axion International Holdings , of Basking Ridge , N.J. , said the engineers constructed a pair of bridges made entirely from recycled plastic products at Fort Bragg , N.C. , and had M1 Abrams tanks driven across the spans .

The M1 Abrams , manufactured by General Dynamics , weighs nearly 70 tons , making it too heavy for the vehicle to use most standard bridges and roads .
Axion , in a release , said its composite technology withstood several tank crossings during the tests June 11 at Fort Bragg .
An article on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Web site said its Construction Engineering Research Laboratory was involved in the design and building of the test structures .
Other U.S. Department of Defense officials were on hand for the testing .
" The first crossing was greeted with a big sigh of relief from some of us and a hardy round of applause from about 30 people in attendance , " Richard Lampo , a CERL materials engineer and leader of the project , said in the article .
The company said its new bridges are made entirely from recycled consumer and industrial plastics .
The two test thermoplastic spans were made from more than 170,000 pounds -- said to be the equivalent of more than 1.1 million 1 - gallon milk jugs -- of recycled plastic .
The structures are less expensive to build than traditional wood timber bridges often used on U.S. military bases .
" This represents a truly historic event for both structural engineers and environmentally conscious individuals across the nation , " Axion Chief Executive Officer James Kerstein said in a company release .
" Not only are these bridges able to support the weight of a M1 Abrams tank , they are less expensive to build than wooden , concrete or steel bridges and are designed using higher - quality 100 percent recycled structural solutions in a manner that is nearly maintenance - free and eco-friendly . "
Axion said its bridges incorporated the company 's patented structural materials made from recycled plastic and a patent - pending I - beam design .
It also claimed speed of installation and reduced costs for construction and maintenance as benefits .
The tests indicated the structures held up well under both moving and static weight loads and withstood stresses caused when the M1 operator applied the vehicle brakes while on the bridge .
Darryl Butler , a civil engineer with Fort Bragg 's Directorate of Public Works , said : " We expect the advantages of the plastic lumber bridge will be lower maintenance costs and the ability to meet long - term training needs .
The potential for this innovative material is only limited by the commander 's requirements and the mission . "
Axion said it developed its patented process in conjunction with researchers at Rutgers University .
It says the resulting products are " ideal replacements " for construction materials such as wood , steel or concrete .

It used to be that Hello Kitty Star Wars stuff was photoshopped , but apparently — for some unfathomable reason — the people at ComicCon in San Diego thought that bringing Star Wars and Hello Kitty together for real would be a good idea .
The result ?
Hello Kitty revealing her true identity under a pink stormtrooper outfit :
When people with booths at the Comic Con decide that making a pink Hello Kitty stormtrooper is a good idea , there is no doubt that the evil feline has clawed her way into the imagination of far too many people for the the world to be safe .
There must be more than a few Star Wars fans turning over in their graves ( soon to be Hello Kittified of course … )
Sent in by Jessica who should have to wear this horrendous costume for the rest of the year for even imagining for a moment that sending me this could be a good idea …
We all know acetaminophen causes liver damage .
Over a long period of time , though , right ?
Nothing to worry about if you ’re taking it for a brief time …
Say , for a couple of weeks .
No problem …right ?
Wrong .
A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association determined that it only takes TWO WEEKS for healthy adults to sustain liver damage from acetaminophen use .
The study involved 106 people taking 4 grams of acetaminophen ( the active ingredient in Tylenol , Excedrin and other pain killers ) a day for two weeks .
Four grams is the maximum daily dose recommended by the manufacturer , so we ’re not even talking about an " abuse " situation here .
Not one person who received the placebo showed any signs of liver damage .
The people taking acetaminophen , however , started having abnormal liver test results — an indication of damage .
The study ’s co-author determined that people should not exceed 4 grams of acetaminophen per day .
Which has me scratching my head — if taking 4 grams a day caused damage , should n’t people avoid getting even CLOSE to that amount ?
Let alone over it !
The FDA , in one of their rare sensible moments , saw these findings as cause for limiting the maximum daily dose of drugs containing acetaminophen to 3,250 milligrams per day , and for stronger labels warning of liver side effects .
Of course , they ’re still riding the " increased risk to people who use them improperly " line .
Again , they ’re maintaining that position even in the face of damage caused to people who were using the drug according to the label ’s instructions !
Who can blame them , though , when they ’ve got OTC drug makers breathing down their necks ?
A statement released by McNeil Consumer Healthcare ( the manufacturers of Tylenol ) said they fear the FDA recommendations could steer consumers away from an " appropriate and safe drug . "
" While we share the FDA ’s mutual goal of preventing and decreasing the misuse and overdose of acetaminophen , we have concerns that some of the FDA recommendations could discourage appropriate use and are not necessary to addressing the root causes of acetaminophen overdose , " the statement reads .
You know , it ’s easy to pay lip service to the " overdose " issue , especially when we ’re inundated with the message that we can just pop a little pill and pain will go away .
But the fact remains — the subjects in the study were n’t going over the very limits put in place by the FDA .
And no amount of spin is going to change that .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Quiet please -- Britain ’s Queen Elizabeth is preparing to have her swans counted .
A swan and a cygnet wait to be measured by The Queen 's Swan Uppers during the annual Swan Upping ceremony , during which young cygnets are counted and assessed for signs of injury or disease , on the River Thames near Shepperton in Surrey , southern England , July 16 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Alessia Pierdomenico
Buckingham Palace has announced that the annual Swan Upping , a tradition dating back to the 12th century which involves a census of the swan population on the River Thames , will be conducted by the queen ’s official Swan Marker from July 20 - 24 .
“ With the assistance of the Queen ’s Swan Warden , Professor Christopher Perrins of the University of Oxford , the swans and young cygnets are also assessed for any signs of injury or disease , ” Buckingham Palace said in announcing the count .
The process involves the Swan Marker , David Barber , rowing up the Thames for five days with the Swan Warden in traditional skiffs while wearing special scarlet uniforms and counting , weighing and measuring swans and cygnets .
It may seem eccentric , but it is very important to the queen .
According to custom , Britain ’s sovereign owns all unmarked , mute swans in open water , but the queen now exercises the right only on stretches of the Thames and its nearby tributaries .
In medieval times , the Swan Marker would not only travel up the river counting the swans , but would catch as many as possible as they were sought - after for banquets and feasts .
This year , the Swan Marker and the Swan Warden are particularly keen to discover how much damage is being caused to swans and cygnets by attacks from dogs and from discarded fishing tackle .
It is also an important year because Queen Elizabeth has decided to join her team of Swan Uppers for part of the census .
She will follow them up the river and visit a local school project on the whole subject of swans , cygnets and the Thames .
“ Education and conservation are essential to the role of Swan Upping and the involvement of school children is always a rewarding experience , ” Buckingham Palace said .
Secret plans to reintroduce hunting foxes , stags and other animals have been drawn up with the backing of senior Conservatives .
Details of the controversial scheme emerged this weekend , including the creation of a Hunt Regulatory Authority ( HRA ) to police the behaviour of hunts .
The plans were drawn up by senior lawyers and the Countryside Alliance , and have the backing of influential Tories including William Hague and Edward Garnier , the shadow justice minister .
They could act as a blueprint for the reintroduction of hunting with dogs across the British countryside , which was outlawed by the hunt ban in 2005 .
The details are certain to reignite the fierce passions which erupted when the Government moved to stop the centuries - old practice .

Brian Fanshawe , a former master of foxhounds who has worked closely on the project for some time , confirmed that senior Tory figures have now backed the proposal : " Stephen [ Lambert , of the Master of Foxhounds Association ] and I went to see several senior Conservatives and suggested that this might be helpful in the repeal of the Hunting Act and they said ' absolutely essential ' .
Everybody recognises it 's a very badly written law but we 've always felt we could n't really justify repeal just on bad law and have hunting go back to the status quo of the ' 80s and '90s .
" What we want to get away from is being accused of being arrogant and not dealing with genuine complaints . "
The group apparently enjoys the support of Viscount Astor , who attended a recent meeting with the HRA at the House of Commons .
Viscount Astor is stepfather to Samantha Cameron , the Tory leader 's wife .
The League Against Cruel Sports is already gearing up to campaign against any reintroduction of hunting .
A spokeswoman said yesterday that recent polling showed the public , including in rural areas , is still overwhelmingly opposed to hunting with dogs .
" We will be working very hard in the run-up to the election to make people aware of the position of their local candidate , " she said .
" Fifty - six per cent of people say they would change their vote if their candidate supports repeal . "
But the hunting campaigner Otis Ferry – son of Roxy Music star Bryan Ferry – said most people in rural areas supported repeal .
" Hunting has n't stopped , " he said .
" Every hunt has maintained its pack of hounds and numbers of staff .
There are people all over England suffering from bad , shoddy legislation .
Hundreds of law - abiding members of society are walking a tightrope when it comes to supporting their local hunt . "
Animal welfare organisations have criticised plans to repeal the ban and the League Against Cruel Sports will next month launch a national campaign targeting key parliamentary seats where they believe pro-hunt groups will seek to campaign in the run-up to the general election .
Hunt supporters are increasingly confident the ban will be overturned if the Conservatives win power and have prepared the blueprint in readiness .
Stephen Lambert , of the Master of Foxhounds Association , said : " We 've built the car , the key is in the ignition , we 're just waiting to turn it . "

The plan he said was to " achieve and maintain repeal of the Hunting Act by making certain we have independent regulation in place .
It is to satisfy the public , the media and parliamentarians that by repealing the Act they 're not just turning the clock back .
Hunting will then have a proper independent system for complaints and for ensuring that proper discipline procedures are kept . "
Anxious to avoid the anarchic scenes that often occurred when pro-and anti-hunt groups clashed , they insist the Hunt Regulatory Authority would mean that foxhunting faced stringent controls .
Under the new scheme entire hunts could be banned , packs of hounds de-registered and hunts barred from holding point to points .
Mr Lambert stressed that six key rules would govern all hunting , including hare coursing and terrier work .
These included the demand that every hunting activity should avoid " unnecessary suffering " ; that everybody engaged in any hunting activity must act in accordance with the law ; that hunting must respect wild , farm and domestic animals , and property including land , trees , crops and watercourses ; that all " reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that hunting is carried out on land with the permission of the owner , tenant or occupier " ; that hunting is carried on " in a manner that respects any other lawful activity being undertaken by any other person on the land " ; and finally that nobody may carry out any hunting " likely to bring hunting into disrepute " .
Every hunt would have to sign up to the plan , he said .
" Under the new system the onus for proper behaviour would fall on the master rather than the staff member .
It is one of the thing that 's wrong with the Hunting Act , that it can convict a huntsman and not the master .
It 's grossly unfair on the staff , " he said .
" If there was some ghastly drama – the hounds accidentally catching a fox in some inappropriate place – it's not against the law but it most definitely brings hunting into disrepute and the HRA would act , " he said .
The new HRA regulator would avoid the criticism of cronyism and having " too cosy " a relationship with the hunting fraternity made against an earlier , similar organisation – the Independent Supervisory Authority for Hunting – by using independent legal experts , he said .
" The Independent Supervisory Authority for Hunting did a very good job but the opponents of hunting felt that it – the people on it – were too close to hunting .
They were n't , but that 's what we were accused of – having too cosy an operation .
So this time we have been much more stringent about it , using a marvellous chap called Mark Lomas QC who is on the Bar Council and has quite a bit of responsibility for disciplinary procedures . "
Under the new proposals the first chair of the HRA , a political nomination , will hold office for three years with the option of a three - year extension .
But subsequent chairs will be appointed by a panel with the brief not to award the office to anyone connected with organisations either for or against hunting .
Mr Fanshawe said it was possible , although " extremely unlikely " , that a hunt could be completely banned .
" They 'd be barred from the association .
A foxhunt would be barred from registering their hounds , from using other people 's hounds .
They would n't be able to have a point to point .
And there would be quite a bit of social stigma , " he said .
But a spokesman for the League Against Cruel Sports said : " Hunters are in cahoots with senior politicians who are promising to repeal the Hunting Act when the opportunity arises , despite the fact that polls show public opinion is against them .
Our campaign will highlight those candidates who have pledged their support for hunting , and those that have n't .
After all , 75 per cent of the public support the ban , and politicians who ignore the public always suffer at the polls . "

The blows came like a one - two punch .
He lost his wife to Alzheimer 's in late 2007 .
The bills ballooned , and next went their house in Highspire last year .
But when authorities seized Baron , his 7 - year - old male collie last month , it was one indignity too many for Miles D. Thomas .
So the 73 - year - old former Harrisburg School Board president filed suit in federal court to get his dog back from the Humane Society of Harrisburg Area Inc .
The agency maintains that the dog is being held as part of a cruelty case but has declined to release details .
For an updated story on this issue , click here .
" To me , he 's the greatest thing I have in the world , " Thomas said of his dog , the fourth in a line of collies the family has owned , all of them named for royalty .
" I love him so much , yet they try to keep me from him .
I can't understand that , " said Thomas , his eyes brimming with tears .
It happened over lunch on a breezy , comfortable 76 - degree day in late July , according to the federal lawsuit .
Thomas said he went for a meal at the Brownstone Cafe in Middletown and left Baron in his Buick LeSabre with the windows down .
" I took him every place I went , " Thomas said of his canine companion .
" I 'd open up the back door and he'd jump right in the backseat .
He loved going in the car with me . "
But when Thomas returned to the car in less than an hour , Baron was gone .
Instead , Humane Society canine officer William Sandstrom handed Thomas a business card and informed him his dog had been seized .
Devastated , Thomas turned to Silver Spring Township dog rescuer Tom Lewis , who referred him to Susquehanna Twp. attorney Andrew Ostrowski .
The lawyer sees it as a civil rights case .
" I could n't imagine letting this man go without his dog , " Ostrowski said .
" He cares deeply for the dog , and he 's seriously affected by this .
In my view , it 's a federal , constitutional civil rights issue , and I wo n't shrink from it . "
This week , U.S. Middle District Judge John E. Jones III issued a temporary restraining order barring the Humane Society of Harrisburg Area from destroying or transferring ownership of Baron .
A hearing is scheduled Sept. 3 . Ostrowski said he 's also pursuing a civil suit that seeks damages .
Amy Kaunas , Humane Society of Harrisburg Area executive director , said Wednesday that Thomas ' dog was seized as part of a cruelty investigation initiated by a referral from the Middletown police .
She declined to discuss specifics of the case , citing agency policy .
However , she pointed to state animal - cruelty statutes stating that animals must be provided with adequate shelter and access to food , water and veterinary care .
Middletown Police Chief Keith Reismiller said Thomas was known to police as a homeless person prone to sleeping in his car in Highspire and Middletown .
The most recent police report regarding Thomas is dated June 18 , when police responded to a complaint of Thomas occupying a space in a Middletown bank parking lot .
When Thomas ' car registration and license plate came back suspended , the plates were removed , the car was towed and Thomas was taken to the Bethesda Mission homeless shelter in Harrisburg , Reismiller said .
Thomas ' dog was not mentioned in the police report , but Reismiller acknowledged that his department contracts with the Humane Society of Harrisburg Area to shelter abused or abandoned animals found in the borough .
The thought of harming Baron is abhorrent to Thomas .
The slump - shouldered former stock - and - commodities broker fell more than $ 100,000 in debt after his ailing wife spent three years in an East Pennsboro nursing home .
Yet Thomas insisted that he always took care of his dog and has the annual veterinary records to prove it .
" To me , Baron is by far the most important [ thing ] , " said Thomas , a fixture on the Harrisburg School Board in the 1970s and early 1980s .
" I took care of him .
I thought of him first .
I took better care of him than I did myself . "
Since Thomas lost his home last year , he has spent most nights in inexpensive rural motels off of U.S. Route 22 .
He estimated that he slept in his car a total of two weeks or so during this period .
Earlier this month , Stephen Conklin , a friend of Ostrowski's , took Thomas in at his farm in Warrington Twp. , York County .
But even with the stability of a home and family around him , the separation from his dog has taken a physical toll on Thomas .
" He 's lost weight , " Conklin said .
" He was at the doctor 's office [ Wednesday ] , and he 's not doing as well . "
Now that Thomas has a stable home situation , Conklin said there 's no reason for the Humane Society to continue to hold Baron .
" It 's beyond the pale , " Conklin said .
" We want him to get his dog back . "
Thomas said he worries more about Baron 's well - being .
" He so attached to me , " he said of the dog .
But the emotional nourishment works both ways .
Thomas saw this firsthand when his wife , Anna , was ill and her memory was slowly receding .
Even then , Baron could bring her back .
On those occasions when Thomas brought the collie to the nursing home , Baron did n't hesitate .
Tail wagging , he went right for Anna 's lap .
" He would jump up and give her a big kiss , " Thomas said .
" She would get a smile on her face .
She could n't talk , but he'd kiss her and she 'd get a big smile . "

Vol. 1 , No. 4 1 October 2001 One Year of Yasser Arafat 's Intifada : How It Started and How It Might End The first anniversary of the current Palestinian Intifada was marked on September 28 , 2001 , throughout parts of the Arab world .
The date was chosen to correspond to Ariel Sharon 's visit to the Temple Mount one year ago , when he served as head of Israel 's parliamentary opposition .
Because of the alleged proximity of his visit to the Al - Aqsa Mosque ( he actually did not get near the Muslim shrines ) , the Palestinians called their uprising : the Al - Aqsa Intifada .
But clearly this name was chosen in order to mobilize Arab and Islamic public opinion for a more general struggle over Jerusalem rather than over the Palestinian cause alone .
" Whoever thinks the Intifada broke out because of the despised Sharon 's visit to the Al - Aqsa Mosque is wrong .... This Intifada was planned in advance , ever since President Arafat 's return from the Camp David Negotiations , " admitted Palestinian Communications Minister ' Imad Al - Faluji six months ago ( Al - Safir , March 3 , 2001 , trans .
MEMRI ) .
Even earlier , Al - Faluji had explained that the Intifada was initiated as the result of a strategic decision made by the Palestinians ( Al - Ayyam , December 6 , 2000 ) .
By forgetting that the present Intifada violence resulted from a strategic decision taken by Yasser Arafat , most diplomatic initiatives over the last year have been misdirected , focusing evenhandedly on both Israel and the PLO .
As a result , these efforts have largely failed .
These previously - noted statements are matched by additional overwhelming evidence that the Intifada was planned in advance and was not a spontaneous popular response to the Sharon visit : Arafat began to call for a new Intifada in the first few months of the year 2000 .
Speaking before Fatah youth in Ramallah , Arafat " hinted that the Palestinian people are likely to turn to the Intifada option " ( Al - Mujahid , April 3 , 2000 ) .
Marwan Barguti , the head of Fatah in the West Bank , explained in early March 2000 : " We must wage a battle in the field alongside of the negotiating battle ... I mean confrontation " ( Ahbar Al - Halil , March 8 , 2000 ) .
During the summer of 2000 , Fatah trained Palestinian youths for the upcoming violence in 40 training camps .
The July 2000 edition of Al - Shuhada monthly , distributed among the Palestinian Security Services , states : " From the negotiating delegation led by the commander and symbol , Abu Amar ( Yasser Arafat ) to the brave Palestinian people , be ready .
The Battle for Jerusalem has begun . "
One month later , the commander of the Palestinian police told the official Palestinian newspaper Al - Hayat Al - Jadida : " The Palestinian police will lead together with the noble sons of the Palestinian people , when the hour of confrontation arrives . "
Freih Abu Middein , the PA Justice Minister , warned that same month : " Violence is near and the Palestinian people are willing to sacrifice even 5,000 casualties . "
( Al - Hayut al - Jadida , August 24 , 2000 -- MEMRI ) .
Another official publication of the Palestinian Authority , Al - Sabah , dated September 11 , 2000 -- more than two weeks before the Sharon visit -- declared : " We will advance and declare a general Intifada for Jerusalem .
The time for the Intifada has arrived , the time for Intifada has arrived , the time for Jihad has arrived . "
Arafat advisor Mamduh Nufal told the French Nouvel Observateur ( March 1 , 2001 ) : " A few days before the Sharon visit to the Mosque , when Arafat requested that we be ready to initiate a clash , I supported mass demonstrations and opposed the use of firearms . "
Of course , Arafat ultimately adopted the use of firearms and bomb attacks against Israeli civilians and military personnel .
On September 30 , 2001 , Nufal detailed in al - Ayyam that Arafat actually issued orders to field commanders for violent confrontations with Israel on September 28 , 2000 .
Since the Intifada was deliberately initiated by Yasser Arafat , the question remains : what exactly did he hope to achieve through this pre-mediated escalation of violence against Israel ?
It should be remembered that when the Camp David Summit broke down in July 2000 , Arafat was blamed for the failure .
Thus , his advisor , Hani al - Hasan , admitted on October 12 , 2000 ( Al - Ayyam , MEMRI ) : " The present Intifada permitted the Palestinians to change the rules of the game , damaging Barak 's attempts to place responsibility for the deadlock in the peace process ( on the Palestinians ) . "
Arafat 's advisors hoped that by combining violence with negotiations , the Palestinian Authority could force Israel to make further tangible concessions .
Moreover , they expected that excessive Israeli firepower would bring about the kind of international intervention that would externally impose new political arrangements on Israel that would be to the Palestinians ' advantage .
Ending the Intifada : Demonstrating that Arafat 's Strategy Failed and is Self - Defeating Arafat 's continuing pursuit of the Intifada option , including the use of his own security forces in attacks against Israeli civilians , is based on his assessment that he is succeeding in converting the violence into tangible gains .
For this reason , Arafat has refrained from taking action to prevent Hamas and Islamic Jihad suicide attacks launched from areas under his control .
Clearly comparing the U.S. Camp David proposals of July 2000 to the December 2000 Clinton parameters and then to the final Taba negotiations of January 2001 , Israel demonstrated its willingness to make further concessions at the negotiating table , despite the Intifada attacks .
While this was not Israel 's intention , Arafat could have concluded that the pressure of the Intifada violence succeeded in altering Israel 's negotiating position .
This process ended once the Sharon government resolved not to engage in substantive peace negotiations while Israelis continued to be under fire .
Nonetheless , a variety of international actors may have given Arafat the impression that his adoption of violence was working .
For example , the Mitchell Committee recommended a settlement freeze , a unilateral Israeli concession that did not previously exist in the Oslo Agreements .
At least the settlement freeze was not an explicit condition for a Palestinian cease - fire , but only appeared at a later stage of the Mitchell sequence , after a " cooling - off period . "
Subsequently , from the G - 8 to the U.S. Department of State , a variety of international actors over the last six months have suggested the deployment of international observers or monitors in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , in order to verify the implementation of any cease - fire .
These international forces would serve Arafat 's intent of internationalizing the Israeli - Palestinian confrontation .
The net impact of these various international interventions was to give Arafat the sense that important elements of the international community contemplated providing him with a quid pro quo for stopping his campaign of violence against Israel .
If Arafat perceives that violence is regarded as an accepted instrument for achieving political ends , then there is no reason why he should permanently terminate the Intifada .
It is not surprising , under such circumstances , that every cease - fire initiative with Yasser Arafat has failed .
The problem Israel faces is not the lack of a political initiative at present that would only reward Arafat 's violence with some new Israeli political concession .
A new U.S. Mideast envoy is also not required .
What is needed is Arafat 's compliance with cease - fire commitments that he has already made but not fulfilled .
This message requires new international political will .
America 's new war against terrorism presents an opportunity for bringing an end to the year - long Intifada .
If Arafat internalizes that there is now a universal norm in the international community renouncing terrorism as a political instrument , it might be possible to alter his cost / benefit calculus as he engages in the present - day violence .
That new norm would have to clearly establish that no political grievance can justify the resort to violence and terrorism .
Indeed , political movements that adopt terrorism should find their cause to be losing international support because of its reliance on such means .
However , if Arafat understands that the new international consensus applies restrictively to the Bin Laden case alone , but not to the terrorism emanating from areas under his jurisdiction , then , unfortunately , the Intifada will likely be prolonged , with all its escalatory potential .

Early Thursday morning , approximately 4,000 Marines from the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade moved into the Taliban - controlled Helmand River valley in southern Afghanistan .
This marked the beginning of the first large - scale operation in Afghanistan to implement a new set of counterinsurgency ( COIN ) practices -- practices adapted from General David Petraeus ' Iraq " surge " strategy .
The COIN strategy at the center of this new operation concentrates on building economic and political infrastructure , protecting the Afghan population , and establishing a working relationship between the people of Helmand and the Afghan government .
Whereas the emphasis was once on " kinetic " operations targeting Taliban forces , US forces are now to be primarily concerned with assisting and protecting the Afghan people rather than hunting the enemy .
In order to do this , Marine units will move into small outposts , dispersed among the population , much like they did in Baghdad during the 2007 surge .
Media accounts have thus far focused mainly on the similarities between the new operation and the successful Iraq surge of 2007 .
However , the immense geographical and political differences between Iraq and Afghanistan will play a greater role in determining the outcome of this operation .
In Iraq , concentrated counterinsurgency efforts in the central hub of Baghdad had the effect of spreading stability throughout the country .
Afghanistan , on the other hand , has no such urban center where COIN efforts can be concentrated .
The country 's harsh mountainous landscape also serves to isolate communities from each other in a way not seen in Iraq .
Less than 10 percent of the nation 's population lives in large cities , and as a result stabilization efforts require greater troop numbers , more dispersed throughout the country .
The enemy in Afghanistan is also quite different from that in Iraq .
The Iraqi insurgency was highly fractured -- consisting of many opposing Sunni and Shiite militias and foreign terrorist elements .
The US military 's ability to leverage hostilities between these groups ( in the form of the Anbar Awakening , where Sunni militants turned against foreign terrorist elements ) was central to the success of the surge .
In contrast , the Afghan Taliban has acted for some time in Helmand as a de facto government , after forcing government officials and police out of the area .
This grants them a unique degree of legitimacy and support among the population not enjoyed by Iraq 's militant factions .
Whether Afghan citizens ' support for the Taliban is merely a begrudging product of fear , or willing support , is hotly contested among experts .
The US military , however , is counting on the willingness of the Afghan people to turn against the Taliban once US forces bring some degree of stability and progress .
Whatever the Afghan peoples ' attitudes toward the Taliban , winning their support will also require tangible improvement in the Afghan government , which is perceived as hopelessly corrupt and ineffective .
The challenges presented by Afghanistan are uniquely daunting .
The prospect of success will depend greatly on US forces ' ability to quickly and effectively adapt strategies to unforseen circumstances and unique challenges .
In a nation more populous and geographically dispersed than Iraq , and with only a fraction of the manpower , victory in Afghanistan is far from certain .
In such a fight , a firm understanding of the enemy , the underlying politics , and the geography can mean the difference between victory and defeat .
The number of murders and manslaughters has dropped by 17 % to a 20 - year low of 648 , the annual crime figures for England and Wales show .
There were 136 fewer killings in 2008 / 9 compared with a year earlier , according to the Home Office figures .
Theft - related crime has risen in the last year , with domestic burglary up by 1 % and shoplifting rising by 10 % .
But overall crime is down by 5 % and violent crime has fallen by 6 % , and gun crime has seen a 17 % fall .
The number of attempted murders is also down 7 % , but attempted murders with knives is up 11 % .
Other violent offences were up , however , including a 5 % increase in the number of women raped to 12,165 .

Download the reader here Police recorded 284,000 domestic burglaries - the first increase in six years .
The British Crime Survey suggests the risk of being a victim of crime has risen from 22 % to 23 % .
The survey , which asks a sample of adults what their experiences of crime have been , shows theft from the person - handbag snatches or pickpocketing - has seen a rise of 25 % .
But BBC Home Affairs correspondent Andy
Tighe said the survey showed overall crime and robbery appeared to be stable .
The annual crime figures are comprised of results from the British Crime Survey and crimes recorded by the police for the 12 months up to March 2009 .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the figures were " encouraging . "
" But we are not complacent .
As in previous years we see changing patterns of crime and we know that during economic downturns certain crimes face upward pressure , which is why we 've already taken action to tackle these head - on .
" Of course statistics are only part of the picture and offer no comfort to victims which is why it is encouraging that confidence at a local level is rising with nearly half of people saying they feel the police and local agencies are dealing with antisocial behaviour and crime in their area . "
Andy Tighe , BBC home affairs correspondent
For a long time burglary was the poor relation of the crime statistics - falling for years , it was regularly ignored by soundbite - hungry politicians .
Not anymore .
Now we are in the midst of a recession , journalists are falling over themselves to find signs of what the Liberal Democrats today are calling " the credit crunch crimewave . "
Certainly , this is the first time the annual burglary figures have gone up for several years .
However , while some parts of the UK like Cambridgeshire and North Wales have seen big rises , other areas like Cleveland and Wiltshire had similarly big falls .
Also , unpublished statistics for the first quarter of this year , with the recession in full - swing , will apparently show the burglary rates levelling out .
One complicating factor - as ever - is the extent to which people even bother to report crimes like burglary if they do n't think it will make any difference .
Perversely , forces running high - profile targeted operations against burglars may , in the short - run at least , see recorded burglary levels go up as more householders think it 's worthwhile contacting them .
The Conservatives said it seemed the government was trying to cover up the extent of knife crime by broadening what crimes are included in the category .
Shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , said : " It looks like the government is trying to cover up the scale of the problem we face with knife crime , little wonder given its policies have failed to get to grips with the challenge .
" Massaging the figures on knife crime twice in two years is just an insult to the families of those who have been tragically murdered in knife attacks and who are campaigning for real action to get knives off our streets . "
The Liberal Democrats said the results reflected an unwillingness of people to report crimes to the police .
Shadow home secretary Chris Huhne said : " Two thirds of all crimes are not being reported .
This is surely why the police were able to record a 5 % drop in crime while the British Crime Survey recorded an extra half a million offences .
" It is deeply disappointing that detection rates have fallen .
If we are to continue to combat crime in a recession then we need more police on the beat catching more criminals , not politicians posturing on penalties . "
Home Office statistician Dr Chris Kershaw said the fall in killings was " striking " and suggested it could be attributed to improvements in medical science .
" It 's certainly very striking and I do n't describe it as a blip , " he said .
The latest annual crime stats do not go into detailed trends on 10 categories of serious violence .
Figures for these crimes are currently being reviewed after statisticians last year feared that some police forces were miscounting offences related to grevious bodily harm .

“ Seven Nation Army ” - Nostalgia 77
Good soul singers make me fall in love , and this track gives me that feeling deep down in my belly like when I had my first real crush in high school .
Add to that the fact that she ’s turning the best rock song of the last 10 years inside out and into a smoky soul song , and you ’ll understand why I ’ve been listening to this song on repeat .
Alice Russell , the singer here , has lots of great material .
More from her will certainly turn up here .
A former aide to John Edwards , the one - time senator whose presidential campaign last year came spectacularly to grief on the rocks of an illicit affair , is set to claim in a tell - all book that his erstwhile boss assured him he would be " taken care of for life " if he pretended to be the father of a child the woman bore .
The remarkable assertion is one of the highlights of a proposal for his book reportedly presented to the St Martin 's Press publishing house .
In it , the aide , Andrew Young , also claims that Mr Edwards made a sex videotape with his former mistress , Rielle Hunter , which he subsequently discovered .
Asking Mr Young to pose as the father , Mr Edwards purportedly told him , " You know how much I love you .
You know I 'd walk off a cliff for you , and I know you 'd walk off a cliff for me . "
The candidate , who was once the Democratic Party 's golden boy and was John Kerry 's running mate in 2004 , went on : " I will never forget this .
And I will always be there for you . "

The book will apparently assert that the father of the child is indeed Mr Edwards .
The one - time rival of Mr Obama in the 2008 primaries has so far not submitted to a DNA test to determine the truth of this .
However , he is still at the heart of a federal investigation into whether campaign money was used in connection with the affair or to help with the efforts to cover it up .
Mr Young says that the FBI has already interviewed him in this regard .
The startling new details contained in the proposal – and the prospect of the book coming out – make the chances of a political rehabilitation for Mr Edwards seem more remote than ever .
" In a culture in which it is almost impossible to sin yourself into permanent banishment ...
Edwards may have pulled the feat off , " Jay Bookman , a commentator for the Atlanta Journal - Constitution noted yesterday .
" It is impossible to feel sympathy for the man . "
Not that Mr Young himself is likely to solicit very much sympathy .
As part of his alleged deal with Mr Edwards , he invited the pregnant Ms Hunter to move in with him , his wife and their three children .
This most peculiar co-habitation ended only after Ms Hunter gave birth .
The saga is thus also about the suffering of the wives involved .
In her own recent book , Resilience , Elizabeth Edwards admits that there is one " pathetic " former aide to her husband she cannot bring herself even to name .
" I will call him Jim , " she writes , calling him an " obsessed fan " , who showed an " unbridled loyalty " to her husband and a " willingness to do anything " .
Few have any doubts that she is referring to the aide who has now turned author , Mr Young .
Since the media is covering black holes more frequently , we figured many of you might like to understand more about the phenomenon .
Today , we have an absolutely fascinating video explaining the principle behind the Schwarzschild Radius .
The Schwarzschild radius ( R s = 2GM / c2 ) is defined as the size at which a spherical astronomical object has been so compressed on itself , it becomes a black hole , generating an absolutely incredible gravitational pull on everything around it , including light .
Do n’t worry , you do n’t have to be a physics geek to understand this , and we ’re sure that after watching the video , you ’ll get that warm , fuzzy , I - learned - something - new feeling .

Member Back to Top Post by mrmolecule on Here 's something I noticed : although the only difference between the " Stalled Out " minigame was the " flesh - colored pants " , the guy holds his crotch , but when he gets a stall , he sits down like a girl would when urinating .
This suggests one of a few things :
a ) " He " is actually a girl with short hair ... but do n't girls pee out of their butts , right ?
So why would " he " be holding the crotch ?
b ) Female programmers wrote it and do n't realize guys STAND UP when they urinate .

NUI Galway researchers have been confirmed as the first to produce a strange molecule made of nitrogen , writes MARINA MURPHY
IT HAS CAUSED a lot of fuss over the years .
Nasa wanted it .
The US Air Force wanted it .
And indeed , chemists have been trying to isolate it for years .
But now an Irish scientist based at NUI Galway has been proven to have delivered it – it being a molecule containing no less than five nitrogen atoms .
“ It ” also comes with a negative charge and a difficult name , pentazole anion ( N5 - ) .
Pentazole is a nitrogen unit that many believe could form the basis of new , energy - intensive rocket fuels that could revolutionise space travel , hence the high level of interest in this molecule .
Prof Dick Butler and his team successfully produced the elusive pentazole anion in their labs in Galway a full seven years ago , but only recently has confirmation of their international success been finally declared .
Such is the fervour with which chemists have gone after pentazole , that when Butler ’s team first reported producing it in 2002 there was a backlash from competitors .
The potential of pentazole is in the production of high - nitrogen compounds , which have three or more linked nitrogen atoms .
“ They are of immense practical interest because they are high - energy molecules , ” according to Butler , who is now emeritus professor of chemistry at NUIG .
Nitrogen can form single , double and triple bonds and the energies tied up in these bonds are substantial .
This means that when a high - nitrogen compound breaks down , a considerable amount of energy is released .
Very few nitrogen only compounds exist , however , and theorists have spent years predicting which ones might be possible .
N5 + was synthesised in 1999 .
But N5 - remained in the realm of conjecture until 2002 when a group at Edwards Air Force in California , reported that they had observed it fleetingly as a gas .
Speculation then began that if N5 - could be tamed and combined with N5 + , the result would be a stable solid that could deliver twice the punch of the same volume of hydrazine , the nitrogen - rich fuel that propels many spacecraft today .
“ The substance N5+N5 - would be a remarkable energy source .
It would break down to five molecules of nitrogen gas giving out a huge amount of energy per atom and with no pollution , ” says Butler .
Nitrogen is the main constituent of air and is therefore non polluting .
Producing pentazole in the gas phase basically involved smashing apart molecules containing the N5 - unit , but this is of limited use .
“ In order to be really useful , chemicals have to be under control in solution and preferably in a bottle , rather than floating around , ” explains Butler .
Butler and his team had already been working on the problem for 10 years when they hit upon the right conditions to produce it using a chemical route in 2002 .
The Galway group ’s method involved using a molecule , ArN5 , a compound of pentazole produced in the 1950s .
Other groups had spent years trying to remove the stabilising Ar ( aryl ) ring and all had failed .
Galway ’s success came by chilling the chemicals to Arctic conditions .
“ Chemical reactions slow down and eventually stop at very low temperatures , ” says Butler .
“ We successfully removed the Aryl group at - 40C and the core N5 - and HN5 - groups survived for a very short time , possibly only a minute . ”
When Butler ’s group first reported that they had produced the long - sought - after molecule in solution , there was a furore .
After all , every scientist dreams of being able to claim a science first .
Some chemists maintained that what Butler ’s team produced was actually NO3 - .
But work published this year by Prof Rod Bartlett at the University of Florida has proved unequivocally that the Galway team did successfully create pentazole in the lab ( The Journal of Physical Chemistry A , 2009 , 113 , 3197 – 3201 ) .
Butler ’s group has considered the potential uses of this tricky molecule .
“ Although it is possible that N5 + combined with N5 - could be a rocket fuel , it would be extremely difficult technically to produce and store large quantities of N5 - anion .
It is also likely to be highly uneconomical .
However one never knows what human ingenuity may achieve , ” Butler says .
“ We went over backwards repeatedly and with great discipline to make sure politics did not influence any national security and homeland security decisions , ” former White House chief of staff Andy Card told POLITICO .
“ The clear instructions were to make sure politics never influenced anything . ”
“ I ’m a little mystified , ” former homeland security adviser Fran Townsend added in an interview .
“ Never in my experience did I see any political influence exerted on the cabinet secretary . ”
Just yesterday , explosive new allegations from Bush Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge confirmed what many had suspected : that Bush used terror alarms to frighten Americans into voting for him .
Predictably , two Bush staffers rebutted Ridge today
I have three questions for Politico .
First , since when is Andy Card a reliable source of anything but bullshit ?

Whales may be the world 's biggest animals , but they do n't stand a chance when hit by a mammoth cruise liner – as has just been proved in Canada .
When the giant vessel Sapphire Princess docked at Vancouver after a trip to Alaska , it was found to have something remarkable impaled on its bow : a fin whale , the second biggest whale species after the blue whale , and thus the second biggest animal on the planet .
This example was about 70ft long and weighed about 70 tonnes .

But even such dimensions are no protection against a ship almost 1,000 ft in length and weighing in at 116,000 tonnes – and that 's before the passengers get on and start eating ice cream .
The Sapphire Princess may have struck the whale in Alaskan waters and carried it unknowingly wedged on the bow back to Canada .
A Vancouver harbour worker , Craig Delahunt , of Tymac Launch Service , said it was the third such ship - whale impalement he had seen .
" Basically like a train coming through , it just hits them .
That bow is kind of like a spear .
And once they 're hit by it , it probably breaks their back , kills them almost instantly , " he said , adding that the skeleton from the last whale carcass is now displayed in a museum in Telegraph Cove , north of the city .
The vessel 's owners , Princess Cruise Lines , said the collision remained a mystery .
" It is unknown how or when this could have happened , as we have strict whale avoidance procedures in place when our ships are in the vicinity of marine life , " it said in a statement .
Before the carcass was removed from the bow , many tourists came to see it or take photos ; they looked on in awe .
" It looks so small compared to the boat , " said Ed McKeowan , 69 , from Chicago .
" I think it 's a shame , but it 's inevitable .
Unfortunately , we share the sea with the whales , " said Ross Harlow , 70 , of Whistler , Canada .
A marine mammal response team from Canada 's Department of Fisheries and Oceans used slings to pull the whale off the ship and tow it across Burrard Inlet , where it was loaded on to a barge and taken to the fisheries laboratory on Vancouver Island .
A necropsy is being performed to determine whether it was alive when it was hit .
" It will probably be a while to determine the cause of death and how long it had been dead , " said the Fisheries and Oceans Department 's Paul Cottrell .
" When they die , they sink to the bottom and a whole incredible ecosystem lives off their carcass . "
WOMEN managers could be $ 13,500 a year better off a year on average if only they had a sex change .
That is the penalty managers pay simply for being female , new research shows .
The research reveals that most workplaces today bear little resemblance to the misogynist office of the 1960s depicted in the hit TV series Mad Men .
Yet women full - time managers on average earn 25 per cent , or $ 22,000 , less than their male counterparts .
And while some of that difference can be explained by factors such as women working fewer hours than men , most is likely to be due to discrimination , says Dr Ian Watson of Macquarie University .
" The idea that management is a male preserve as depicted in Mad Men is so outdated , " he said .
" Since the 1970s women have been coming through universities and into management . "
Despite the progress , men are twice as likely to become managers as women , and if women have young children , their odds shrink further .
But remarkably , the women who do make it into management ranks are similar to men in most ways that count .
The factors once thought crucial in explaining the gender wage gap at management level are hardly relevant today .
LOS ANGELES , Aug. 23 ( UPI ) --
The idea of taxes on " junk food " to help pay for the restructuring the U.S. healthcare system is gaining popularity , experts say .
Public health experts and lawmakers in six states have voiced support for slapping " sin taxes " on high - calorie foods and drinks , such as soda pop , that they blame for an epidemic of obesity and its soaring related healthcare costs , the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday .

The general public also seems to be moving in the direction , the newspaper said , citing a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released in July indicating that 55 percent of respondents favored a tax on unhealthful snack foods , up from 52 percent in April .
The poll , meanwhile , found that support for a soda tax rose to 53 percent from 46 percent , the Times said .
The Urban Institute claimed in a report this summer that rising obesity rates could cause the American life expectancy to fall for the first time in history .
" This is the most ridiculous idea I 've heard , " Kellie Glass , a registered dietitian in Ashland , Ky. , told the newspaper .
" Folks are just not going to give up all the foods they love , even if they are more expensive . "

Almost 4 out of 10 ( 38 % ) Republicans and Republican - leaning independents have an unfavorable opinion of their own party , while just 7 % of Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents have an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party .
Additionally , a May 29 - 31 USA Today / Gallup poll shows that the top - of - mind images of the Republican Party among Republicans are considerably more negative than are the images of the Democratic Party among Democrats .
What passes for Inside - the - Beltway conventional wisdom is clear : the first midterm election after the election of a president sees his party losing seats in Congress .
And Democrats have plenty of very iffy seats -- seats narrowly won in basically , or even , red districts .
Take Travis Childers ' northern Mississippi district ( MS - 1 ) .
He won the seat in a razor - thin 50/50 election .
Although Obama only got 38 % of the vote , a surge in African - American voting -- blacks make up about 26 % of the district 's population -- helped put Childers over the hump in what had become an open seat .
Since getting into Congress , Childers has voted more like a Republican than any other Democrat in the House .
Both on overall votes and on core issues , Childers has been a fairly dependable vote for John Boehner and Eric Cantor .
Something tells me that huge African - American Democratic surge from last November is n't going to be there for Childers in 2010 , just like it was n't there last year for Don Cazayoux in Louisiana ( who also got into office with African - American help and immediately commenced voting like a reactionary Republican ) .
And there are dozens of seats in similar jeopardy where conservative Democrats like Childers -- Walt Minnick ( Blue - Dog - ID ) , Bobby Bright ( Blue - Dog - AL ) , Ann Kirkpatrick ( Blue - Dog - AZ ) , Parker Griffith ( Blue - Dog - AL ) , Glenn Nye ( Blue - Dog - VA ) , Frank Kratovil ( Blue - Dog - MD ) , Suzanne Kosmas ( D - FL ) , Kathleen Dahlkemper ( D - PA ) , Jason Altmire ( Blue - Dog - PA ) , Chris Carney ( Blue - Dog - PA ) , Harry Mitchell ( Blue - Dog - AZ ) , Gabby Giffords ( Blue - Dog - AZ ) , Baron Hill ( Blue - Dog - IN ) , Bill Foster ( D - IL ) , just to name some of the most obvious -- are counting on Republican and conservative independents to put them over in 2010 .
Eric
Cantor thinks the GOP is going to trounce these Democrats and take back control of the House .
This despite a new Gallup poll , out today , that shows evenand Republican - leaning independents have an unfavorable opinion of the GOP
Let me inject two factors here : the Republican playbook for dealing with the political state of affairs and how that has worked historically , and Obama 's Karl Rove , Rahm Emanuel .
The Republican knee - jerk obstructionism is going over very badly .
And they should have known .
They 're singing from the same hymn book that they used in the 1930s after Democrats took back Congress in the light of the Republican Party 's Great Depression .
Not one single GOP House member voted for Social Security -- not one .
Instead everything FDR and the Democrats in Congress tried to do was greeted with shouts of " socialism , " and absolute apoplectic hysteria by the right - wing noise machine .
The result : in 1928 there were 270 Republicans and 164 Democrats in the House and in the Senate there were 56 Republicans and 35 Democrats .
Over the course of the next 4 elections , the louder the Republicans screamed socialism and the more obstructionist they became , the more seats they lost .
They lost seats in both houses in every election for a decade .
By 1936 their 56 seat majority in the Senate was down to 17 seats and in the House they only had 88 left .
But , unlike FDR , Eric Cantor has the supremely overrated Rahm Emanuel as a tactician and foil .
This morning Emanuel penned an OpEd in the , making the case that vulnerable Democrats back Obama 's promise to bailout European banks by guaranteeing a $ 108 billion loan to the IMF , something he had tacked onto the War Supplemental in the House of Lords .
Travis Childers and Democrats in conservative districts cannot win re-election by voting for a costly bailout for European banksters .
But Emanuel is dealing with him and other Democrats the same way he did when he pushed through the highly unpopular -- and extremely destructive -- NAFTA legislation for Bill Clinton .
He 's wheelin ' and dealin ' ... and threatening .
He 'll let the vicious but loaded AIPAC monsters lose on you to finance a primary ; he 'll kill your ( Childers ' in this case ) post office request .
He has no intellectual argument beyond , do n't undermine the promises Obama made to the G20 leaders .
Many of those leaders had their heads handed to them in the Europeans elections this past weekend .
Gordon Brown nearly lost his job entirely and his party lost control of every single local council in England -- equivalent to the Democrats losing every state legislature .
Across Europe -- and including England -- actual fascists were elected by spouting right - wing populism , racism , xenophobia and a revulsion for bailing out banksters .
And that 's where Emanuel wants to drag the Democratic Party ?
Did n't he do enough damage to the party and to America with NAFTA ?
I think President Obama should direct his staff to think about bailing out California instead , and let the Europeans borrow the billions of dollars they need directly from the Chinese and leave us out of it .
We have -- largely because of corrupt hacks like Rahm NAFTA Emanuel -- enough problems right here at home .

What prompted the Colliers to attend a Congressional district meeting for the first time was an almost solemn sense of the magnitude of the health care issue , and its place in determining the scope of American government .
“ We both think this is the most important thing we ’ve ever seen in our lifetimes , ” Mr. Collier said the next day in an interview at his family ’s four - bedroom house , overlooking a fishing pond .
“ I mean , the Vietnam War , which was a big deal in my early formative years , pales in comparison to the way this thing could turn our country . ”
“ I know we need some reform , ” he said , in a deliberative drawl .
“ I ’ve just got questions about how we ’re going to do it . ”
Ms. Collier , 60 , an interior designer , said she had wanted Mr. Bishop , a soft - spoken centrist Democrat who has yet to take a formal position on the legislation , to understand that there were deep concerns .

“ I wanted to make sure we were represented , ” she said .
The Colliers are committed conservatives who have voted Republican in presidential elections since 1980 .
They receive much of their information from Fox News , Rush Limbaugh ’s radio program and Matt Drudge ’s Web site .
But they said their direct experience with the health care system had persuaded them of the need for change .
When Ms. Collier ’s breast cancer was diagnosed three years ago , Mr. Collier ’s employer - provided insurance paid for her office visits , a biopsy and three surgeries .
But the insurer covered only a small fraction of her radiation treatments , which it considered experimental , leaving the Colliers with a $ 63,000 bill .
To their great relief , the charge was later written off by Emory Healthcare , whose doctors had recommended the regimen .
Nearly three and a half years after workers began stripping hazardous materials from the former Deutsche Bank building near ground zero , officials expect the project will finally be finished next week .
But according to officials and regulators , the demolition of the 26 remaining stories of the structure , which stands as a grim reminder of the terrorist attack , will take at least seven more months , with the final price tag soaring to an estimated $ 300 million from $ 45 million in 2004 .
The deconstruction of the hulking tower has been marked by the most stringent environmental restrictions , as well as delays , regulatory failures by city agencies , criminal investigations of contractors and the death of two firefighters in a blaze two years ago .
Yet , even as the work lags behind the most recent timetable set by officials , the end now appears close .
“ It ’s way too late , but at least we ’re nearly there , ” said Councilman Alan J. Gerson , who heads a City Council committee overseeing work at the building .

Finnix 93.0 itself is a maintenance release , but due to the length of time between Finnix 92.1 and 93.0 , the time between Debian upstream updates warranted a major version number bump .
New features include Linux kernel 2.6.30 , and updated upstream software .
Xark 's Dan Conover , evidently a newspaperman , writes in " The newspaper suicide pact " about the mountain of bullshit that has entered the discussion about the future of newspaper business - models .
This is some of the clearest , most interesting , best - referenced criticism of the newspaper industry 's thrash - and - FUD I 've read :
Newspapers that are turning to paywall plans today are gambling on a risky revenue stream that even the experts are n't predicting will provide a replacement to their lost advertising revenues ( their biggest financial problem is the rapid decline in advertising rates , not the slow decline in print circulation ) .
It 's a " well , we 've got to do SOMETHING " solution , not a logical , do - the - math solution .
And since since most media companies are owned by shareholders , the resulting loss of confidence could be catastrophic .
What will these media executives do when that reality hits them ?
When these debt - burdened chains , stripped of journalistic talent by a decade of profiteering , their web traffic reduced by 60 percent by their paid - content follies , their pockets emptied by the cost of the proprietary paywall systems offered by Journalism Online LLC and other opportunistic vendors , what will they do ?…
They do n't get it .
They do n't want to get it .
And in many cases , they 're literally paid not to get it .
America 's journalism infrastructure – from corporate giants to non-profit foundations like the American Press Institute and the Newspaper Association of America – is funded by dying companies .
So when you hear about efforts to save newspapers ( and , by extension , journalism ) , understand that answers that do n't return the possibility of double - digit profits and perpetual top - down control are n't even considered answers .
They 're not even considered .
They 'll do anything to survive … so long as it does n't involve change .
Inconceivable ?
Here ’s Tom Coburn ( R - Eliminationist ) on Meet The Press last week saying that lawmakers have “ earned ” the fury of wingnuts :
Coburn is nothing if not consistent .
In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing , he was part of a House contingent that helped delay and soften an antiterrorism bill .
This cohort even tried to strip out a provision blocking domestic fund - raising by foreign terrorist organizations like Hamas .
Why ?
The far right , in league with the National Rifle Association , was angry at the federal government for aggressively policing America ’s self - appointed militias .
( Emphasis mine )
The party that drove this country into the ground wants to turn their own incompetence into “ proof ” for their anti-government agenda , and they ’re not afraid to flirt with eliminationism in the process .
Today Frank Rich observes
Rich links to the C - SPAN archive of Coburn ’s floor speech , which is an incendiary work of hyperbole :
Terrorism in this country obviously poses a serious threat to us as a free society .
It generates fear .
But there is a far greater fear that is present in this country , and that is fear of our own Government .
We should not further that fear .
We should not do anything to promote further lack of confidence in our own Government .
Public officials must recognize that our citizens fear not only terrorism , but our Government as well .
A recent Gallup Poll found that an astounding 52 percent of the people believe the Federal Government has become so large and powerful that it poses a threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens .
Four out of ten thought that this danger was imminent .
We can ill afford to pass legislation in the name of antiterrorism that is seen by many law - abiding citizens of this country as a threat to their freedoms .
( Emphasis mine )
Get that ?
Government = terrorism .
Yet in spite of his tinfoil - hat individualism , Coburn can be plenty authoritarian when he wants .
Here ’s David Weigel two years ago :
( I ) n many important ways Coburn represents the Republican Party ’s decade - long lunge away from libertarian rhetoric .
He is a firm social conservative , a man absolutely opposed to , say , the “ gay agenda , ” which he defines as “ a cultural thing that has nothing to do with gay people who want to live their lives ; a product of the culture of the sexual freedom revolution . ”
Coburn is also a dependable vote for the Iraq war , for PATRIOT
Act renewal , for most measures in the “ war on terror . ”
He has regretted that the United States did n’t respond to the outbreak of AIDS with some of the coercive tactics Cuba used .
Fascism in furtherance of Coburn ’s agenda ?
Water for the tree of liberty !
Community organizing in favor of a different agenda ?
Evil fascism !
In the weeks before the billion dollar " Cash For Clunkers " bill passed into law , we heard a lot of complaining about its anemic watered - downness .
It was n't big enough !
The rules were inconsistent and weird !
The government is paying hundreds of thousands of people who would have traded in their cars anyway to hold out until late July , all for a paltry 50,000 - or - so net increase in auto sales !
Well , the Detroit Free -Press and the New York Daily News both report today that customers are swarming dealerships , and Jalopnik today tells us " variations " on the bill 's name -- cash 4 clunkerzz , and such -- have catapulted the bill onto the Google Trends list of fastest - accelerating web memes .
But today even hardened C4C - skeptic Jalopnik associate editor Matt Hardigree tells us he was surprised to notice in his blog 's running clunker photo gallery that readers of his site were trading in cars with Blue Book values significantly higher than the $ 4,500 trade - in offered under the terms of the bill .
Of particular interest was this 1989 Toyota Land Cruiser with 77,000 miles .
Hardigree estimates its regular trade - in value at $ 5,500 , making the economic cost of participating in the program $ 1,000 , plus the emotional toll of destroying a perfectly good car when one is a car lover .
( Hardigree says he has gotten numerous emails from car dealerships overjoyed by the new business but invariably traumatized by the experience of wrecking perfectly driveable cars . )
But if people are trading in good low - mileage cars they might otherwise have kept driving out of some patriotic - environmental concerns , and buzz around the program is still gaining momentum , there are clearly some behavioral economic forces at work here that could make Cash For Clunkers even more successful than lawmakers had hoped .
Now if only we could say the same for the whole mortgage modification thing .
Since the crew of Apollo 17 returned from the moon in December 1972 , no human has ever left low - Earth orbit .
Five space shuttles , scores of Russian Soyuz capsules , the International Space Station , and more than 450 men and women have left the Earth since Apollo , but all have been bound to a small shell of space just outside our atmosphere .
Any hope of an ambitious successor to Apollo might have been abandoned altogether if it was n't for George W Bush .
In 2003 , he announced plans for Nasa to return to the moon by 2020 and then travel on to Mars by 2030 .
Once again , though , the US faces some serious competition .
The same year that Bush tasked Nasa with the 21st century moonshot , Yang Lee Wei became China 's first astronaut and , explicit or not , another space race had begun .
" The attitude to the space programme in China is a little bit like the attitude towards space exploration in the western world in the 1960s , " says Kevin Fong , an expert in space medicine at University College London .
" There 's a deep fervour among their university kids for space technology .
The main difference between China and America now is that China can just do something - they do n't need to ask permission or go through a democratic process and get the budget approved . "
This means that China can progress its space programme quickly ; if it wants to land on the moon - and many observers think it does - the country could do it well ahead of 2020 , the earliest possible date for an American return .
China 's only confirmed plans so far include launching another robotic orbiter to the moon , probably followed by a robot lander and perhaps a lunar rover .
Beyond that , we might not find whether China wants to put a person on the moon until it does it .
Its successes are broadcast all over the world , but its failures remain internal .
That has n't stopped serious people taking it seriously , though : last year the former Nasa administrator , Mike Griffin , said he believed China had the capability to get to the moon and he would n't be surprised if the next person to walk on the moon was Chinese .
" It 's all very dark out there and you 're not really sure how much they 're doing , " says Fong .
" They seem very serious about it and have mature thoughts about it , from the little you see in their presentations .
They still have much to learn from the existing space community and do n't want to be too overt about their ambitions at risk of looking like they 've over - promised . "
The Indians are also hot on the heels of the US .
India worked on an embryonic space programme with the Soviet Union in the 1970s and flew its first cosmonaut in 1982 .
Today the budgets are relatively big - around $ 800 m a year and a 10 - year plan for human spaceflight that has committed funding of more than $ 1.2 bn .
It has already sent a robotic probe to the moon , but there is still plenty to prove in terms of human spaceflight - the country has indicated bold ambitions but has still not revealed any confirmed details that it will send people into orbit , never mind all the way to the moon .
The Chinese and the Indians have many advantages over the Americans of the 1960s - they are starting well ahead of Apollo in terms of technology .
But it might not be technology that decides the winner .
Aiming for space is about more than understanding flight paths and knowing the best rockets to use : moon shots are about taking risks .
Fong points out that the Apollo programme prioritised mission objectives over life or limb .
No one was complacent about the danger , he says , but since most of the astronauts were former test pilots , they understood that things can - and would - go wrong .
The modern Nasa has inverted this priority - today the astronauts ' lives are absolutely more important than mission goals .
This will have to change if Nasa is to return to the moon and , particularly , if it wants to send people to Mars .
And perhaps here China will have a clear advantage over the US .
And what about the Brits ?
This country has a fantastically successful ( if largely invisible ) robotic space industry .
And , against all the odds , it has its first official astronaut in the shape of Tim Peake , an army helicopter test pilot .
Despite providing no funds for human spaceflight , science minister Paul Drayson is optimistic that a British astronaut could one day walk on the moon .
" I hope so , " he says .
" We 're absolutely committed to space research , both manned and unmanned .
It 's hugely aspirational and extremely challenging and helps us put things in perspective . "

کروبی به هاشمی : شایعه تجاوز جنسی در زندانها را پیگیری کنید
توضیح تصویر، پسر آقای کروبی می گوید آقای هاشمی بعد از دوازده روز جوابی به نامه پدرش نداده اس ت
مهدی کروبی، از نامزدهای معترض به نتایج انتخابات در ایران، در نامه ای به اکبر هاشمی رفسنجانی، رئیس مجلس خبرگان ،
از او خواسته درباره شایعاتی که درباره تجاوز به دختران و پسران در بازداشتگاه ها پخش شده است، تحقیق کند .
این نامه که در وب سایت رسمی حزب اعتماد ملی منتشر شده، تاری خ ۷ مرداد یعنی ۱۲ روز پیش را دارد و پسر آقای کروبی در توضیح آن نوشته است که پدرش این نامه را ده روز بعد از فرستادن خصوصی برای آقای هاشمی و در حالی که جواب ی از او نگرفته است، برای عموم منتشر می کند .
آقای کروبی در نامه خود خطاب به آقای هاشمی می نویسد : " عده‌ا ی از افراد بازداشت‌شده مطرح نموده‌اند که برخی افراد با دختران بازداشتی با شدتی تجاو ز نموده‌اند که منجر به ایجاد جراحات و پارگی در سیستم تناسل ی آنان گردیده است .
از سوی دیگر افرادی به پسرهای جوان زندانی با حالتی وحشیانه تجاوز کرده‌اند به طوری‌که برخی دچار افسردگی و مشکلات جدی روحی و جسمی گردیده‌اند و در کنج خانه‌های خود خزیده‌اند . "
آقای کروبی گفته است اگر " این رفتارهای ش ناعت آمیز " را " به طور متوات ر
از افراد مختلف که در روزهای اخیر آ زاد شده اند " نشنیده بود، باورشان برایش سخت بود .
آقای کروب ی از رئیس مجلس خبرگان رهبری خواسته است این موضوع را " به صورتی که صلاح می داند " با آیت الله علی خامنه ای، رهبر ایران، در میان بگذارد و
نیز هیاتی برای بررسی این مساله تشکیل دهد .
آقای کروبی اعلام آمادگی کرده است که مسئولیت تحقیق و بررسی جهت تعیین صحت و سقم این اخبار را برعهده گیرد .
مهدی کروبی در نامه خود از منابع خبری خود نام نبرده، اما نوشته است : " افراد ی این مطالب را به من گفته‌اند که دارای پست‌های حساس در این کشور بوده‌اند .
نیروهای نام و
نشان داری که تعدادی از آنها نیز از رزمندگان دفاع مقدس بوده‌اند .
این افراد اظهار داشته‌اند اتفاقی در زندان‌ها رخ داده است که چنانچه حتی اگر یک مورد نیز صدق داشته باشد ، فاجعه‌ای است برای جمهوری اسلامی . "
آقای کروبی گفته است که گمان نمی کند کسانی که در ۱۵ سال مبارزه با حکومت پهلو ی ( از سال ۱۳۴۲ تا ۱۳۵۷ ) در زندان بوده اند ،
از جمله خود او و آقای هاشمی، چنین چیزهایی را " دیده یا شنیده باشند " .
مهدی کروبی در بخش دیگر ی از نامه خود به " حوادث تلخ " دیگری که بعد از انتخابا ت ریاست جمهوری در ایران رخ داد اشاره کرده است : " از دستگیری‌های بی‌حساب و کتاب ،
از ضرب و شتم و وارد کردن جراحات تا شهادت فرزندان این کشور ، از حمله به خانه‌های مردم تا فاجعه خونین کوی دانشگاه و برخوردهای خشن و وحشت‌انگیز حتی با خانم‌ها در سطح خیابان‌های شهر، که تاکنون سابقه نداشته است ... از برخوردهای خشن و بی‌محابا، بر سر مردم باتوم را خرد کردن ،
آنچنان که بعد از گذشت قریب به ۴۰ روز همچنان اوضاعشان غیرعاد ی است و عوارض آن روی بدنشان قابل مشاهده است.
هتاکی و ابراز دشنام و فحاشی رکیک به افراد و نثار نوامیس بازداشت‌شدگان و مردمی که برای نماز جمعه آمده بودند . "
Millions of people around the world seek cash rewards by becoming guinea pigs ( Image : Brand New Images )
FIFTY million people around the world are guinea pigs in clinical trials testing experimental drugs right now .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Like any politician , it seems Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is prone to saying one thing when he's on the hustings and doing another thing when he 's back inside the Washington Beltway .
A case in point is the issue of too - big - to - fail banks roaming the American economy .
Bernanke was asked about this issue more than any other during his town hall meeting on Sunday night with citizens of Kansas City .
The Fed chairman went to Kansas City to assure the average Americans that the economy was on the mend and the central bank was on top of the situation .
But going through decades of endless debate and little action over the too - big - to - fail question did n't fit with that strategy .
" The problem we have is that in a financial crisis if you let the big firms collapse in a disorderly way , they 'll bring down the whole system , " Bernanke told the meeting .
" When the elephant falls down , all the grass gets crushed as well , " Bernanke added .
He said he had to " hold his nose " to rescue such institutions during this crisis .
As a result , Bernanke said it was his " top priority " to fix the issue of too - big - to - fail .
But Burt Ely , an expert on banking regulation , does not see that sense of urgency from the central bank or the White House .
The Obama administration 's reform of Wall Street regulation , which is backed by Bernanke on almost all points , basically sidesteps the issue of too - big - to - fail , argues Ely .
The plan would put extra requirements on the capital and activities of firms found to be too - big - to - fail .
It would also put in place a new resolution program between bailout and bankruptcy where the government can come in and seize the firm and unwind it in an orderly way .
The Fed 's top expert on the subject , Gary Stern , the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank , said he was disappointed in the approach taken by Treasury , calling it " status quo plus . "
" The Treasury proposal fails to come to grips with too - big - to - fail and therefore leaves the financial system considerably more vulnerable than it needs to be to future bouts of instability , " Stern said in a speech earlier this month .
" There is little reason to think that these steps will , individually or collectively , succeed in reining in too - big - to - fail effectively over time because they do not change the incentives which create the problem .
In fact , there is nothing in the Treasury proposal designed to put creditors of large , systemically important financial institutions at risk of loss , " Stern said .
Stern wants the government to insist that it will not bail out uninsured creditors of the biggest firms .
This will make risk more expensive .
In turn , banks wo n't be able to take on excessive amounts .
Ely said the Fed and other banking regulators have flubbed the issue for decades and major questions remain in the wake of Bernanke 's handling of the recent crisis .
" It was all ad hoc , and precedents have now been set , " Ely said .
Experts still debate why the government let Lehman Brothers fail after a buyer was found for Bear Stearns .
Even in the aftermath of the crisis , regulators are still reluctant to identify which firms are too - big - to - fail , Ely said .
" How far does it extend -- to firms like GE Capital and insurance companies ?
Does it include domestic operations of foreign banks ? "
Ely asked .
Ely advocates a solution where big financial firms are required to find a series of voluntary guarantors who would agree to provide - for a fee -- unlimited equity should a firm exhaust its supply .
Ely said he was never able to make any headway with his argument until the recent crisis hit .
" People are coming toward me , " Ely said .
" We 're not going to get rid of these big financial institutions .
We 're stuck with these big monsters , " Ely said .
Energizer " D " Battery Exposed A NaturalNews PhotoTour by Mike Adams
Why are Energizer " D " batteries so weak ?
To find out the answer , I decided to take one apart and see what was inside .
As this picture reveals , inside the " D " battery is a much smaller battery !
The Energizer " D " battery is actually just a cheap plastic shell surrounding a much smaller , low - capacity battery similar in size and capacity to an " AA " battery ( 2500 mAh ) .
This explains why the Energizer " D " rechargeable battery has such low power capacity to begin with .
The company does n't even try to make it a high - capacity " D " battery , it seems .
They 're filling part of the inside of the battery body with nothing more than cheap plastic and useless air .
And how much does Energizer charge for this " D " battery ?
More than $ 12 each !
It 's true :
These inferior " D " batteries cost around $ 25 for a pack of two .
These are known as " Energizer E2 Rechargeable Batteries , Size D , " rated at 2500 mAh each .
( mAh is a measure of how much power is contained in the battery .
It 's sort of like the fuel tank in your car .
The bigger the number , the more power the battery delivers . )
By comparison , an Energizer AA battery rated at the exact same capacity -- 2500 mAh -- costs about THREE dollars !
So why is a " D " battery priced at 400 % more than an AA battery with the exact same capacity ?
Because Energizer can get away with it , probably .
Most consumers have no idea about the mAh numbers .
They just look at the physical size of the battery and figure it has more capacity .
( Mainstream consumers are remarkably gullible , and few understand any technical specs at all . )
By comparison , check out the Powerex " D " rechargeable batteries at BetterLifeGoods.com .
These batteries have more than 300 % more power than the Energizer batteries , and they only cost slightly more !
( $ 15 dollars vs. about $ 12 , for triple the power ) .
They 're also significantly heavier .
And you know why they 're heavier ?
Because they do n't contain a bunch of cheap plastic and air gaps inside !
So what is Energizer up to with their low - capacity 2500 mAh " D " batteries , anyway ?

By By Andrew Moran Aug 11 , 2009 in Politics
The man who saw the economic collapse happen two years prior has raised $ 350,000 in one day for his run at a Connecticut Senate seat .
Andrew Schiff , campaign spokesperson and brother to Peter , believes that he will be at the $ 1 million mark by the end of August and called the money - bomb , " A pretty good take .
Not a homerun , but certainly a stand - up double . "
Majority of donations to his campaign have been online and checks through the mail .
Schiff is calling on private donors that he personally knows as well , according to Andrew Schiff .
Peter Schiff will make his final decision in September if he will run for Senator in Connecticut .
If so , he will run as a Republican and face off against other Republicans such as former Ambassador Tom Foley , State Senator Sam Caliguri and former Congressman Rob Simmons .
Schiff was recently on MSNBC's The Ed Show to discuss health care however , he did not get a chance to state his position because the host consistently interrupted him and told him what he thinks about health care .
At one point , the host asked Schiff to say in 30 seconds what he thinks about health care , after five seconds the host interrupted him .
For years now , Schiff has made himself well known of accurately forecasting the current economic collapse , the government 's handling of crisis and what the future will hold for the United States economy .
According to Capitol Watch , Peter Schiff , President of Euro Pacific Capital and author of The Little Book of Bull Moves in a Bear Market , raised $ 804,485 as of noon Monday for his Senate campaign .
Prior to Monday 's money - bomb , Schiff had $ 450,000 , including $ 50,000 from himself .
Andrew Schiff , campaign spokesperson and brother to Peter , believes that he will be at the $ 1 million mark by the end of August and called the money - bomb , " A pretty good take .

Wikipedia has been dinged for violating 3,000 copyrights belonging to the National Portrait Gallery .
User DCoetzee uploaded the images here to the Wikimedia Commons site .
The Gallery says it contacted the Wikimedia Foundation back in April , without success , so is now suing the uploader personally .
He received the notification on Friday and posted it here , and alerted El Reg to it following our Copyfraud article .
It 's not Copyfraud , however , which is defined as the false assertion of copyright over public domain material .
While the portraits are long out of copyright , the photographs are n't , and the gallery owns these rights .
In a page on its website that explains its copyright policy , the NPG says it has " a public duty not only to conserve and display works in its Collection but also to ensure they are correctly represented in reproductions and publications " .
Copyright expert Struan Robertson of law firm Pinsett Masons told us it was a straightforward breach of copyright , but the US location of the infringer added a wrinkle .
" The copyright owner has to enforce the order in the US .
It 's possible to do , but it can be quite expensive , " he said .
As Charles Eicher , author of our recent Copyfraud piece , explained here ( see How To Copyright Michelangelo ) , the US legal situation is unusual , in that since 1999 , a photograph of an artwork cannot be copyrighted .
Many US galleries and museums had already handed over exploitation rights , many of which can only be sourced to Corbis - Bill Gates ' other monopoly .
The Gallery says the infringement is enflamed by Wikipedia 's use of a permissive licence .
" By posting the images to the Wikipedia website you are expressly authorising users to themselves make further copies of those images on their own screens and hard drives in the manner permitted by the GNU Free Documentation License .
Therefore , by authorising that use you are also primarily liable under 16 ( 2 ) of the CDPA for every subsequent copyright infringement committed by every member of the public that re-uses those images anywhere in the world , " wrote the Gallery 's lawyers , Farrer & Co .
Ironically , the first DMCA takedown we ever received at El Reg ( after the act had been operating for eight years ) was from ... a Wikipedian . ®
The local zoning board in the Hamptons is blocking a children 's reading wing in the local library , because it might attract kids from lower class areas , says a Hamptons library director .
According to an article in the New York Post , Dennis Fabiszak , the East Hampton Library Director , the expansion is being blocked because " ( t ) here are people with great political influence who are opposed to any expansion of services to people outside the immediate community . "
The problem is that if there is an expansion , kids from surrounding areas would be allowed to use the library as well .
Needless to say , this has Mummy and Daddykins worried about their precious little snowflakes .
Fabiszak said one delaying tactic was from zoning board members who wanted a breakdown of library cardholders by community .
" We refused to provide it because it 's not important , " he told the Post .
Fabiszak believed it showed the board was concerned about the " types " of kids who would actually use the library .
Zoning board co-chair Joan Denny responded : " To say that we are opposed to kids from certain communities coming to the library is ridiculous .
We 're doing our due diligence .
We want all the facts , on parking , on traffic , on everything . " " Certain " communities ?
You mean the ones with " those people " in them ?
Bill Esseks , the library 's lawyer , said there are some things in the meeting minutes that show the board truly is worried about kids from " certain " communities coming to the library .
Now , the board is delaying by calling for a number of environmental reviews , but Fabiszak says this is a stall tactic , because they 're exempt from these reviews , since the library is an educational institution .
While I 'm outraged at this type of behavior , I 'm not surprised .
Even in my own community , there are plenty of affluent people who maintain a panicked death grip on their belongings whenever they see someone who makes less than six figures .
And there is definitely that sense of " those people " from " that part of town . "
I heard it from firsthand when we lived in Irvington , a historic neighborhood in Indianapolis , and I still hear it today when I live in the northern suburbs of Indy .
We just saw similar racist and classist behavior in Philadelphia last month , when the Valley Swim Club tried to stop inner-city kids from using their " private , exclusive " pool , but then invited them back after an international backlash .
I would hope that the Town of East Hampton and the manager William McGintee ( email : wmcgintee@town.east-hampton.ny.us ) would reconsider this elitist — some might say , racist — policy of preventing children from less affluent communities from learning .
Quit hiding behind environmental studies and other nonsense .
Quit clutching your purses and putting your hands over your wallets anytime someone in a domestic car drives through your community .
And for God 's sake , quit being such uptight ninnies .
This is exactly why people do n't like you .---
The voices of the abused emerge raw and bleak from pages 113 to 119 of Volume V of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse .
They told their stories to an interviewing team .
In an introductory note to the section , the team acknowledged their courage : “ We were deeply moved , inspired and humbled by our contact with you .
Although we spent only a few hours with you , meeting you and listening to your stories was a moving and enriching experience for all of us .
We felt privileged and honoured that you trusted us with such intensely personal and private experiences .

What are the real dangers ?
The answer depends on whom you ask and what you 're measuring .
Far fewer children die from unintentional injuries - car and bicycle accidents , drowning , fires - than was the case 20 years ago , according to the National Center for Health Statistics .
U.S. Justice Department reports show that crime against children - along with violent crime in general - is down .
And the scenario that gives parents the greatest terror - abduction and murder by a stranger - happened about 50 times in 1999 ( the latest year for which there are Justice Department statistics ) .
That 's once for every 1.5 million kids .

Hopkins researchers are investigating a troubling potential source of resistant pathogens : the American farm .
By Dale Keiger
Opening photo courtesy Thomas Arledge / Johns Hopkins Public Health E llen Silbergeld , Eng ' 72 ( PhD ) , recalls that she did not want to go to the seminar .
She was a professor of epidemiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1999 when her department 's chairman needed an audience for the seminar 's presenter , a candidate for a faculty position .
Silbergeld recalls the chairman saying , " Please , just sit in the room .
You can come to lunch . "
So she sat in the room , and something caught her attention .
The seminar was on hospital - acquired infections , but the presenter mentioned in passing that some drug - resistant infections came from food .
That seemed odd .
Silbergeld knew you could pick up Salmonella from , say , tainted chicken salad .
But how would that Salmonella have become resistant to antibiotics ?
She turned to a colleague and asked .
Because , he said , factory chicken farms routinely feed antibiotics to their flocks , to accelerate growth , and the drugs generate resistance .
Ten years later , Silbergeld , now a professor of environmental health sciences at the Bloomberg School of Public Health , is one of several researchers at Johns Hopkins and around the world assembling evidence that the industrial farming of chickens , pigs , and cattle is cultivating more than poultry and livestock — it 's cultivating bacteria that medicine is losing the ability to fight .
Antimicrobial drugs , including antibiotics like penicillin , ciprofloxacin , and methicillin , kill pathogenic bacteria .
But they simultaneously drive the resistance that is bacteria 's defense , especially when administered in low , subtherapeutic doses .
Scientists estimate that 50 percent to 80 percent of all antimicrobials in the United States are not used by doctors to treat sick people or animals but are added to farm animal feed , mostly in such subtherapeutic dosages .
Public health researchers like Silbergeld are convinced that this nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials is building dangerous genetic reservoirs of resistance .
If they are right , industrial agriculture is fostering and dispersing drug - resistant bacteria that impair medicine 's ability to protect the public from them .
The United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) estimates that livestock and poultry produce 335 million tons of manure per year , which is one way resistant pathogens get out of animals and into the environment .
That 's 40 times as much fecal waste as humans produce annually .
Farms use it for fertilizer and collect it in sheds and manure lagoons , but those containment measures do not prevent infectious microbes from getting into the air , soil , and water .
They can be transported off the farms by the animals themselves , houseflies , farm trucks , and farm workers , and by spreading manure on other fields .
Out in the environment , they form a sort of bank of genetic material that enables the spread of resistance .
" This development of drug resistance scares the hell out of me , " says Kellogg Schwab .
Kellogg Schwab , director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Water and Health , refers to a typical pig farm manure lagoon that he sampled .
" There were 10 million E. coli per liter [ of sampled waste ] .
Ten million .
And you have a hundred million liters in some of those pits .
So you can have trillions of bacteria present , of which 89 percent are resistant to drugs .
That 's a massive amount that in a rain event can contaminate the environment . "
He adds , " This development of drug resistance scares the hell out of me .
If we continue on and we lose the ability to fight these microorganisms , a robust , healthy individual has a chance of dying , where before we would be able to prevent that death . "
Schwab says that if he tried , he could not build a better incubator of resistant pathogens than a factory farm .
He , Silbergeld , and others assert that the level of danger has yet to be widely acknowledged .
Says Schwab , " It 's not appreciated until it 's your mother , or your son , or you trying to fight off an infection that will not go away because the last mechanism to fight it has been usurped by someone putting it into a pig or a chicken . "
I ndustrial agriculture , known variously as factory farming , concentrated - animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) , and industrial farm animal production ( IFAP ) , has produced an abundance of affordable steaks , pork chops , and broilers for grocery shelves over the last 65 years or so .
It grew out of chicken farms on the Delmarva Peninsula , Midwestern pork processing plants , and cattle feedlots in Kansas and elsewhere .
In 2008 , the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Bloomberg School produced a report titled " Putting Meat on the Table : Industrial Farm Animal Production in America , " that outlined how , after the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945 , farm mechanization and the Green Revolution 's program of genetic selection , irrigation , and chemical fertilizers combined to produce grain , soybean , and especially corn harvests of extraordinary abundance .
With all that available corn , if you could feed it to livestock , you did n't need to raise animals in pastures .
You could concentrate them in barns or feedlots and raise far more animals on far less land .
Meanwhile , starting with mechanized hog slaughterhouses and Delmarva chicken farms , canny entrepreneurs began to figure out how to take traditional animal husbandry — grazing cattle , rooting pigs , and chickens pecking in a barnyard — and transform it into the industrial production of protein , with the efficiencies and economies of scale of any manufacturing industry .
They also grasped the entrepreneurial advantages of vertical integration .
On Maryland 's Eastern Shore , Arthur W. Perdue left his job as a railroad agent in 1920 to sell eggs .
By the 1940s , the company he founded began moving into the production of broilers .
Arthur 's son , Frank , took over the company in 1950 and invested in hatcheries , soybean refineries , feed mills , and processing plants , launching the company on a course to become a modern integrated farming operation .
The concept was simple :
If Perdue owned the hatchery , the feed production , and the processing plants , it could gain significant efficiencies , control its costs , establish the steady , predictable production of raw materials , and grow into a very large company with control of a significant share of the market .
According to Perdue , by 2007 it was processing 633 million chickens per year and had total sales of $ 4.1 billion .
I n July 1946 , the Journal of Biological Chemistry published a research paper out of the University of Wisconsin that detailed the results of feeding three antimicrobials to chickens .
The summary included a crucial sentence : " Sulfasuxidine and streptomycin singly or in combination lead to increased growth responses in chicks receiving our basal diet supplemented with adequate amounts of folic acid . "
That is , feeding antimicrobials to chickens made them grow faster .
Agribusiness , eager to increase profits by minimizing how long it took to get a chicken breast or pork roast from the farm to your dinner table , was about to become a major customer for pharmaceutical products .
How major is disputed .
In 1999 , the Animal Health Institute ( AHI ) , a trade association representing 17 companies including Abbott Laboratories , Bayer , Dow AgroSciences , Monsanto Company , and Pfizer , released a study that estimated 17.8 million pounds of antimicrobials were used each year , for all purposes and for all animals , including pets .
For its 2001 report , " Hogging It : Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock , " the Union of Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) mined data on antimicrobial production and concluded that AHI 's figures were much too low ; UCS estimated that 24.6 million pounds are applied annually just for nontherapeutic purposes — primarily growth promotion — in only three types of farm animals — cattle , swine , and poultry .
A 2003 paper published by Poultry Science questioned both figures and stated , " No unbiased estimates of antimicrobial use in animals exist at the present time . "
Any estimate becomes problematic as soon as one understands what UCS called " the dismal absence of information " about both production and consumption of antimicrobials .
The federal government does not collect figures on how much product comes out of the pharmaceutical industry , nor does it require agricultural corporations to disclose how much they use .

In his 1945 Nobel Prize address , Alexander Fleming warned that it was easy to produce microbes resistant to his discovery , penicillin : Simply expose them to concentrations of the drug insufficient to kill them .
Possibly the first warning that antibiotics could produce drug - resistant pathogens in poultry came as far back as 1951 , when two bacteriologists at the University of California , Davis named Mortimer P. Starr and Donald M. Reynolds published a paper that noted in its summary : " The use of streptomycin as a growth - promoting supplement in turkey poults results in the appearance within three days of streptomycin- resistant coliform bacteria . "
But little apparent attention was paid to Starr and Reynolds , or to Fleming .
During ensuing decades , tens of millions of pounds of tetracycline , penicillin , and other antibiotics were fed to animals on American and European farms .
In some cases , the drugs were used to treat sick animals , in amounts that killed the bacteria .
But most were fed to cattle , pigs , turkeys , and chickens in exactly the subtherapeutic dosages that Fleming warned would only make bacteria stronger .
After Silbergeld first heard about farmers feeding antibiotic additives to broiler chickens , she asked two faculty members in Maryland 's poultry science program to show her the school 's chicken barns on the Eastern Shore .
As soon as she walked into one , she thought , " This is really serious . "
There were thousands of chickens crowded in tight confines .
She says , " They are raised — how can I put this nicely ? — they are raised on top of their own shit .
They walk around on litter , which is sawdust or some kind of substrate , covered in feces .
It 's the most unhygienic thing you can imagine . "
The air was hot and full of dust .
Periodic partial removal of litter from the barns created large piles of manure that were stored outside with minimal containment measures .
Any farm worker laboring in such a facility had to be exposed to microbes , Silbergeld thought .
If the chickens had been fed antibiotics , then some of those microbes had to be drug resistant .
While still at the University of Maryland , Silbergeld decided her first farm project would be to study whether poultry workers and people in farm communities were at risk of carrying the same strains of drug - resistant bacteria found in chickens , a study she finished after she came to Johns Hopkins in 2001 .
In Eastern Shore communities like Pocomoke City , Princess Anne , Smyrna , and Salisbury , she enrolled three groups of subjects : workers whose job was to catch chickens in the barns to load onto trucks for transport to processing plants , chicken hangers who attached live birds to the mechanized line at the plant , and community residents who did not work in the industry but lived near it .
She found that 41 percent of the chicken catchers had been colonized by Campylobacter jejuni , which is commensal in poultry — it derives benefit from the chicken without harming it — but pathogenic in people , where it 's the second - leading cause of gastrointestinal disease in the United States .
Among the workers at the poultry processing plant , the rate of colonization was 63 percent .
Of the nine people who lived near but did not work in the industry , 100 percent had been colonized .
Carole and Frank Morison became contract growers for Perdue 22 years ago on a farm near Pocomoke City .
Drive down U.S. 13 toward the Morisons ' place and you will see the land become flat as a plank and ideal for farming .
The roads around Pocomoke City lead past one chicken farm after another , each marked by a sign displaying the name of the farm and the company that provides its chickens : Aydelotte Farm — Tyson ; Sheep House Farm — Tyson ; Poor Boy Farm — Mountaire ; Meatball Farm — Tyson .
You will see long , closed barns vented by giant fans .
What you will not see anywhere is a chicken .
They are there , hundreds of thousands of them , but they are all enclosed in the barns .
From the road , you do n't even hear a cluck .
The Morisons began to notice how often their farm neighbors complained of not feeling well .
In 1987 , Frank Morison , a second - generation Eastern Shore farmer , approached Perdue to get into the chicken business .
There was no such thing as becoming a poultry farmer by simply buying some chickens to raise .
If you did not have a contract with a processor like Perdue , Tyson , or Mountaire , you would have great difficulty buying chicks , buying feed , or finding a place to sell your broilers after they 'd reached market weight .
Basically , Morison says , anything but doing business with a big processor was impossible .
So Morison borrowed $ 200,000 against his house and his land to build a pair of 20,000 - square - foot barns .
Perdue specified every aspect of the construction .
After the barns were built , one day a truck pulled up to the farm and delivered 54,400 chicks , plus the feed that Morison , by stipulation of his contract with Perdue , was to feed them .
Perdue dictated the number and type of chicks , which they owned and merely consigned to Morison ; the amount , price , and composition of feed ; and the date , 51 to 53 days later , on which workers would be back to pick up the grown birds for processing .
Whenever the chickens from his farm were processed , Perdue informed Morison how much they weighed , how much it would pay him per pound , and how much the company was deducting for feed and other supplies it had required him to use .
Morison says in the end he typically cleared 2 percent to 3 percent per flock , not counting his labor .
Neither federal nor state regulations require processors to divulge the exact contents of the feed they furnish their growers ; the government allows the processors to treat that information as proprietary .
So the Morisons say they never knew the quantity of heavy metals like selenium , copper , arsenic , and zinc , or the amount of drugs like tetracycline and penicillin , that were going into , and eventually coming out of , the birds on their farm .
But they began to notice how often their farm neighbors complained of not feeling well .
Carole says , " There are a lot of sarcastic jokes among farmers .
You'd be talking to someone and he'd say , ' Yeah , I 'm not feeling too good this week , I got vaccinated along with the chickens . '
It was just a routine thing .
But people were having ' the bug ' too often .
Kind of like flu symptoms : achy body , upset stomach , bronchial issues . "
The Morisons exhibited the same symptoms .
Around 1995 , Carole recalls , she became intolerant of antibiotics , which began to give her hives , upset her stomach , and worsen her asthma .
" To this day , I still have problems . "
Last July , the Morisons got out of the chicken business .
They say that Perdue had notified them that to continue growing for the company , they would need to make $ 150,000 worth of upgrades to their facilities .
They balked at the expense and decided they 'd had enough of farming .
They are now employed by the Socially Responsible Agriculture Project , working to link farmers all over the Chesapeake Bay watershed and create local markets and local distribution systems .
" Going back to raising food the way it used to be raised , " Carole says .
A t Hopkins , Silbergeld decided to concentrate her initial research on the occupational health aspects of factory farming .
With five co-authors from the Bloomberg School and the School of Medicine , she published the first U.S. - based study of poultry workers colonized by resistant microbes , reporting that 50 percent of surveyed workers carried E. coli that was resistant to the antimicrobial gentamicin , compared to only 3 percent of community members who did not work with poultry .
She studied the association between occupational contact with live chickens , Campylobacter jejuni , and peripheral neuropathy , and found a significantly elevated presence of anti-Campylobacter antibodies in poultry workers , indicating colonization ; many of those workers also reported symptoms of neurological disorders associated with the pathogen .

Kellogg Schwab Researchers at other institutions around the world reported similar associations .
At industrial poultry or swine farms , there were drug - resistant bacteria colonizing farm workers and their families .
In 2003 and 2004 , Kellogg Schwab sampled the air at a factory farm that housed 3,000 hogs in two buildings .
The samples contained enterococci , staph , and streptococci , and 98 percent of the bacterial isolates were resistant to two or more common antimicrobials .
In a paper published in Environmental Health Perspectives , Schwab suggested that one way bacteria could travel from animals to humans was by workers breathing that air .
In another study from 2002 to 2004 , Schwab sampled surface and ground water upgradient and downgradient from a pig farm .
He and his co-researchers found the downgradient water — that is , water in the direction of flow from the pig barns — contained 17 times as much enterococci , 11 times as much E. coli , and 33 times as much fecal coliforms as water upgradient from the facility .
The downgradient pathogens also were much more likely to be antibiotic resistant .
One day , a Bloomberg School colleague down the hall from Silbergeld came back from a weekend on the Eastern Shore complaining about how disgusting she 'd found having to drive behind a truck hauling chickens to a processing plant .
Silbergeld remarks , " When somebody says ' disgusting , ' I say , ' Wait a minute , there 's got to be something going on here . ' "
She and two of her students , Ana Rule and Sean Evans , designed what they called the " baby - you - can - drive - my - car " study .
They loaded passenger cars with sampling equipment , figured out that an intersection on the Eastern Shore near the Virginia border would have a lot of poultry trucks passing through on the way to Perdue and Tyson processing plants , and drove to an adjacent shopping center parking lot .
Whenever a poultry truck stopped at the traffic light , the researchers would slide in behind and follow it to the processors .
Afterward , they sampled the air inside the car , as well as the car 's exterior door handles and an unopened soda can they had placed in the car 's cup holder .
They found that the air in the car and both surfaces showed increased levels of enterococci after they 'd driven behind the chicken trucks .
Samples obtained before the car followed the trucks contained no resistant enterococci ; a quarter of the bacteria isolated after the trucks showed resistance to antimicrobials , including tetracycline , erythromycin , and streptomycin .
This was not the only study that involved a car .
Jay Graham , formerly one of Silbergeld 's grad students and now at the United States Agency for International Development , was studying issues of waste disposal on the Eastern Shore .
He noticed that every time he came back to Baltimore , his car was covered with flies , and this led him to wonder if flies might be capable of dispersing resistant bacteria from factory farms .
Graham told Silbergeld that he wanted to do a study .
" I said , ' That 's OK , so long as you do n't bring any flies here . '
The next thing I knew , we had these two big jars full of flies in the lab and I thought , ' So much for that . ' "
Graham had trapped the flies near poultry farms on the Eastern Shore and found resistant staph and enterococci on them .
He analyzed both pathogens for drug - resistance genes and found matches in bacteria taken from the flies and bacteria taken from farm litter , a strong indication that flies are a potential source of exposure to the resistant bacteria lurking in farm wastes .
S cientists know that resistant pathogens can travel from farms by air , water , bird , housefly , chicken truck , or manure spreader , but they do not yet have a good answer to how far they can travel or how long they can remain viable .
Just because a researcher detects drug - resistant staph in an air sample does n't prove it 's likely to make anyone sick .
But one means of transmission that can cover significant distances is person - to - person — a farm worker , for example , picks up bacteria in a chicken barn and passes it to a family member , who passes it to a member of the community , who brings it into a health clinic or hospital , where it takes up residence and begins causing antibiotic - resistant infections in surgical patients and the immuno - compromised .
For years , scientists , physicians , and the public have regarded increasingly prevalent drug - resistant infections as a hospital problem ( see " Bugs vs. Drugs , " Johns Hopkins Magazine , February 2008 ) .
That 's where dangerous microbes like vancomycin - resistant enterococci ( VRE ) and methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) lurk and spread .
But then hospitals began to report more and more people who had never been near a health care facility coming through their doors already colonized by resistant bacteria .
Where were people picking up bugs like MRSA , which now kills more than 20,000 people each year , more people than die from AIDS ?
About three years ago , Silbergeld began thinking about MRSA and industrial agriculture .
She was not the only one .
In November 2006 , Dutch researchers reported the case of a young mother treated for mastitis in October 2004 .
Cultures taken by her general practitioner revealed MRSA , which was then found in her husband and baby daughter .
Her husband was a farmer with 8,000 pigs , and when researchers tested 10 chosen at random from the farm , they found genetically identical MRSA in eight of them , and the same bug in three other workers from the farm .
In another case , also from Holland , a 63 - year - old woman had been admitted to a hospital with MRSA - caused endocarditis .
When scientists typed her infection , they found it did not match hospital - acquired strains of MRSA , nor the strains causing community - acquired MRSA skin infections in the United States .
What it did match was MRSA isolated from Dutch pig farms .
Yet another study from Holland found the rate of MRSA colonization among pig farmers to be 760 times that of the general public .
A year later , Canadian research published in Veterinary Microbiology was the first to find MRSA in North American pigs and pig farmers ; scientists studied farms in Ontario and found MRSA in 25 percent of tested pigs , and 20 percent of workers from farms that had colonized animals .
On farms that were free of colonized pigs , there were no human cases .
Finally , last January , a study out of the University of Iowa sampled 299 pigs and 20 workers from two farms in Iowa and Illinois .
The researchers found MRSA in 49 percent of the animals and 45 percent of the people .
This was the first such finding in the United States , and the strain , ST398 , was identical to what had been found in Canada and Holland .
About three years ago , Silbergeld began thinking about MRSA and industrial agriculture .
Silbergeld has begun a MRSA study of her own , trying to establish attributable risk — that is , how much exposure to industrial agriculture contributes to the overall prevalence of MRSA in people coming into hospitals .
The crux of the matter , she believes , comes down to molecular biology .
Bacteria have a remarkable capability for sharing genes , through what is known as horizontal gene transfer .
The old view of resistance was Darwinian :
In the presence of antibiotics , a mutation would be naturally selected if the mutated gene helped a microbe survive application of the drugs .
" That underestimates the brilliance of microbes , " Silbergeld says .
Molecular biologists now understand that within a microbial community , one microbe can acquire genetic material from another microbe , even a microbe of a much different type , then incorporate it in its own genome and thus acquire resistance to an antibiotic it has not yet even encountered .
It 's as if bacteria are capable of downloading resistance from a gene database .
What 's more , microbes carry genes in what are called resistance cassettes , which can be thought of as kits that contain a variety of genes for fighting off different drugs .
So , a germ resistant to tetracycline may have a resistance cassette that contains not only the gene for fighting off that drug , but genes resistant to other drugs , as well .
The result ?
A person could be colonized by a tetracycline - resistant germ that does her no harm , but lurks in her system and contains , in its cassette , resistance to methicillin .
If this unlucky person then acquires a simple staph infection , and that staph encounters the first microbe and taps its resistance cassette , her routine staph infection has now become MRSA and she could be in real trouble .
Silbergeld 's biggest concern is that factory farms are building reservoirs of these resistance cassettes in animals , in the environment , and in humans .
T he trade association for the Eastern Shore 's poultry producers is Delmarva Poultry Industry , Inc .
The day before Earth Day 2009 , the headline on DPI 's Web site read , " Every Day is Earth Day for Delmarva 's Chicken Industry . "
The agriculture industry argues that removing antibiotics will result in more sick animals , that there is insufficient data to prove that resistant pathogens from farms are making people sick , and that there needs to be better drug - specific risk assessment .
For its part , Perdue states that it does not use antibiotics for growth promotion , " nor do we use any antibiotics continuously for any reason , " according to a statement on its Web site .
In a 2006 USA Today story , Tyson 's chief veterinarian said that his company had reduced its antibiotic use from 853,000 pounds in 1997 to 59,000 pounds in 2004 , and now applied antibiotics to less than 1 percent of its broilers .
( A Perdue spokesperson said the company would not consent to an interview for this story .
Neither Tyson nor DPI returned calls from Johns Hopkins Magazine . )
The May 2009 issue of For the Record , " straight talk about antibiotic use , " published by Alpharma Animal Health , a division of King Pharmaceuticals , cites four studies that state the risk of transmission of drug - resistant pathogens from farm animals to humans is negligible , as would be the benefit of withdrawing antibiotics such as virginiamycin from agricultural use .
Three of the studies were conducted by Cox Associates , a consulting firm that does health - risk analysis for the USDA and for a variety of corporations and industry associations , including the American Petroleum Institute , the Chemical Manufacturer 's Association , Monsanto , and Mobil Oil .
One Cox study , published in Environment International , says that " it appears very probable that such a withdrawal [ of virginiamycin from agricultural use ] would cause many times more human illnesses than it would prevent . "
That study acknowledges use of a quantitative assessment tool that was developed with financial support from AHI , the agricultural pharmaceutical trade association .
Sebastian Dovey , a managing partner at Scorpio Partnership , a wealth consulting firm in London , said that “ we have not seen huge amounts of movement ” of American money out of Swiss banks .
The current penalty for this type of failure to disclose assets is up to 50 percent of the highest annual balance of each account for each of the last three years  an amount that can quickly wipe out an investor and still leave him owing taxes and interest .
Investors who come forward before Sept. 23 face a reduced penalty , of 5 percent to 20 percent , depending in part on whether the wealth was inherited .
They will also be hit with the penalty just once , on the highest balance in the accounts during the last six years .
The Justice Department has opened criminal investigations of 150 UBS clients , and is likely to bring more indictments on top of the four it brought in recent months .
Only clients who are prosecuted are likely to have their names become public .
The landmark settlement is expected to provide a road map for the I.R.S. as it tries to clamp down on tax evasion by Americans who use offshore accounts .
Smaller Swiss banks are still helping clients hide billions of dollars through complex structures in offshore havens in the Caribbean , Panama , Luxembourg , Singapore and Guernsey in the English Channel .
The crackdown is casting a spotlight on the network of lawyers , accountants and advisers who help underpin the Swiss private banking industry by steering clients to such banks .
An American official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly , said this week that the Justice Department was preparing criminal cases against some of the Swiss agents and intermediaries who set up offshore entities for clients and funnel their money to private banks .
They take a referral fee in the process  sometimes up to 50 percent , according to a former UBS private banker .
The article " Closing Argument at Guantanamo : The Torture of Mohammed Jawad
Major David J.R. Frakt " has been published in the Harvard Human Rights Journal .
The journal 's editors give high praise to the brilliant work of JAG Frakt , beginning with this introduction .
The editors of the Harvard Human Rights Journal are pleased to publish Major David J.R. Frakt ’s argument for a pre-trial dismissal in the case of United States v. Mohammed Jawad .
Jawad was the first military commission case to squarely present the issue of the provable torture of a detainee at Guantanamo Bay , and Mohammed Jawad was the first Guantanamo detainee to take the witness stand in a military commission and describe his mistreatment under oath .
JAG
Frakt not only defended his client but he spoke truth to power as only a outraged patriot could do .
He put on the court record the outrageous duplicity before congress and criminal acts of Donald Rumsfeld .
His success , in court , gives credence to his claims .
Throughout the Global War on Terror we have heard repeatedly from our military and civilian leaders that this was a new kind of war , a war that requires new methods , new ideas , " thinking outside the box . "
So that is what the highly creative and motivated people at Guantanamo did ; they abandoned the tried and true and lawful methods of Army Field Manual 34 - 5262 and wrote a new playbook , a playbook that included intimidation with dogs , sexual humiliation , and sleep deprivation .
These and other methods were employed at Guantanamo and , as the Schlesinger report put it , migrated to Abu Ghraib , where they resulted in the shocking conduct portrayed in the infamous photographs .
The Secretary of Defense said " take the gloves off " and the soldiers and sailors of Guantanamo saluted smartly and said , " Yes , Sir ! "
In fact , many of the illegal and abusive " enhanced " interrogation techniques were personally approved for use by the Secretary of Defense ; other techniques , like the frequent flyer program , were simply invented on the fly .
The public revelation of the events at Abu Ghraib on 60 Minutes II in late April 200464 caused the Department of Defense to go into full damage control mode .
As part of the damage assessment , Secretary Rumsfeld dispatched the Navy Inspector General , Vice Admiral Church , to Guantanamo
to evaluate the treatment of detainees there .
He visited Guantanamo from May 5 to May 7 , 2004 , and reported back to the Secretary and to the press that there was virtually no detainee abuse at Guantanamo , and that everything was in order .
General Hood was running a tight ship .
Detainees received great treatment .
Incredibly , the very day that Admiral Church was investigating conditions at Guantanamo and finding the treatment of detainees to be so wonderful , detention officials at Guantanamo ordered the initiation of the frequent flyer program on Mohammed Jawad .
Before the wheels of Admiral Church ’s plane were even off the Guantanamo runway , Mohammed Jawad ’s arms and legs were being shackled in preparation for the first of 112 moves up and down the hall of L Block , every 3 hours for the next 14 days .
While Mr. Jawad was being shackled for the first of these moves , back on Capitol Hill , Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was testifying before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees , reassuring the nation that the abuse at Abu Ghraib was isolated to a few rogue guards .
When Secretary Rumsfeld testified before the HASC on May 7 , 2004 , the day the torture of Mohammed Jawad commenced , he told Congress , in reference to those detainees who had been abused at Abu Ghraib , " I am seeking a way to provide appropriate compensation to those detainees who suffered such grievous and brutal abuse and cruelty at the hands of a few members of the U.S. military .
It is the right thing to do . "
Today , the government takes a decidedly different tack .
They deny the suffering of Mr. Jawad , accusing him of being weak .
And they are attempting to reward him by pressing forward with the first war crimes trial against a child soldier in the history of the civilized world .
Valtin has observed that the order to release Jawad will not stop his suffering or even secure his release .
Congress ' cowardice has left Jawad in legal limbo .
However , Valtin 's tireless efforts to stop torture and restore the stature of American psychologists assisted in securing this verdict .
As previously reported by McClatchy News , Mr. Jawad 's release is going to be complicated by the provisions of an amendment the cowardly U.S. Congress stuck onto the recent Defense Appropriations Bill .
But all lindications are that Jawad is going home to Afghanistan before the end of August .
But his private hell will not end there , as the sufferings he endured will haunt him for a long , long time , if not the rest of his life .
As I wrote to the Convening Authority at Guantanamo , Judge Susan Crawford , last September :
This case has particular interest for me , as in my professional role as a licensed psychologist , I have worked with victims of torture from multiple countries around the world , both as a psychotherapist , and in a forensic role .
I have been certified as an expert witness in the immigration court of the Department of Homeland Security ....
As a psychologist myself , I was horrified to read that young Jawad endured multiple episodes of 30 - day isolation upon the " recommendation of a psychologist with Guantánamo ’s Behavioral Science Consultation Team ( BSCT ) who suggested that he was feigning homesickness and depression as a technique to resist interrogations . "
Even after Mr. Jawad reportedly made a suicide attempt in December 2003 , he was subjected to Guantanamo's " frequent flyer " program , which , according to a Washington Post article I read last month , consisted of moving Jawad and other prisoners " repeatedly from cell to cell to cause sleep deprivation and disorientation as punishment and to soften detainees for subsequent interrogation . "
JAG Fract , by winning this case with this damning evidence has put into the legal record , a basis for trying Yoo , Cheney , Rumsfeld and other high level Bush administration officials as war criminals .
It 's past time to appoint a special prosecutor .
However , if American courts do n't act there is now a clear case on the record for action in the Hague or other courts to try Cheney , Rumsfeld and other high level Bush administration officials for war crimes .
New York , NY , July 16 , 2009 -- As lawmakers debate how to pay for an overhaul of the nation 's health care system , a new report from The Commonwealth Fund projects that including both private and public insurance choices in a new insurance exchange would save the United States as much as $ 265 billion in administrative costs from 2010 to 2020 .
Congressional leaders are attempting to keep 10 - year federal budget costs of health care reform legislation under $ 1 trillion .
" Health reform can help pay for itself , but both private and public insurance choices are critically important , " said Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis , who coauthored the new report .
" A public insurance plan can help drive new efficiencies in the system that will produce large cost reductions .
Without a public plan , much of those potential savings will be lost . "
The Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance Health System has put forward a comprehensive set of policy options to achieve near - universal health insurance coverage while reforming the U.S. health care system to achieve nearly $ 3 trillion in savings by 2020 .
Central to this proposal is the creation of a national insurance exchange that would largely replace the individual and small - group insurance markets , offering families and business a choice of private or public plans with a benchmark standardized - benefit package .
The new report , How Health Care Reform Can Lower the Costs of Insurance Administration , says that it is possible to achieve near - universal coverage , improve health care quality and efficiency , and lower the trajectory of health care costs through a comprehensive private - public approach to health reform .
A Commonwealth Fund analysis of three paths to reform found that an approach that includes a public plan in the exchange that would pay providers at Medicare rates would save about $ 265 billion in administrative costs over 2010 - 2020 .
On the other hand , an insurance exchange that provided a choice of private plans only would increase administrative costs by $ 32 billion over the same period .
Savings from the mixed private - public reform approach would be realized through less marketing and underwriting , reduced costs of claims administration , less time spent negotiating provider payment rates , and fewer or standardized commissions to insurance brokers .
" A public plan would create an incentive for competitive private plan premiums with streamlined operations , " said Davis .
" Savings from these new efficiencies can be used to extend health insurance to people who can't afford it and to improve benefits . "
The United States leads all other industrialized countries in the share of national health care expenditures devoted to administration .
The cost of administering the U.S. health care system totaled nearly $ 156 billion in 2007 , and that figure is expected to double -- reaching $ 315 billion -- by 2018 .
In addition , costs incurred by physicians in their transactions with health plans are estimated to be as high as $ 31 billion a year .
About 12.4 percent -- or $ 96 billion -- of the $ 775 billion in privately insured health care spending went for administrative costs in 2007 .
That $ 96 billion -- representing what insurance companies received in premiums , minus what was paid in medical claims -- included claims processing , advertising , sales commissions , underwriting , and other administrative functions ; net additions to reserves ; rate credits and dividends ; premium taxes ; and profits .
By contrast about 6.1 percent -- or $ 60 billion -- of the $ 974 billion in public program health care spending went for administrative costs in 2007 .
That includes federal , state , and local governments ' administrative costs for public health programs such as Medicare , Medicaid , and the State Children 's Health Insurance Program .
Medicare prescription drug coverage , provided by private plans , has high administrative costs but is included in public program administration figures .
Private Part D plans averaged 11.3 percent in administrative costs as a share of total drug spending .
The absence of underwriting and profits has kept the administrative costs of public insurance programs relatively low .
However , between 2005 and 2006 , Medicare 's annual administrative costs jumped from $ 12 billion to $ 20 billion , largely because of increased payments to cover the administrative costs of private health and drug plans participating in the program .
By contrast , administrative costs in traditional fee - for - service Medicare actually declined slightly over the same period .
" Health care reform represents a significant opportunity to reduce administrative complexity in the current system , " said Sara Collins , a vice president at The Commonwealth Fund and a coauthor of the new report .
" These findings indicate that such simplification will help lower premiums and reduce the cost of extending affordable coverage to everyone . "

This fall , evolutionary biologist and bestselling author Richard Dawkins -- most recently famous for his public exhortation to atheism , “ The God Delusion ” -- returns to writing about science .
Dawkins ’ new book , “ The Greatest Show on Earth , ” will inform and regale us with the stunning “ evidence for evolution , ” as the subtitle says .
It will surely be an impressive display , as Dawkins excels at making the case for evolution .
But it ’s also fair to ask :
Who in the United States will read Dawkins ’ new book ( or ones like it ) and have any sort of epiphany , or change his or her mind ?
Surely not those who need it most : America ’s anti-evolutionists .
These religious adherents often view science itself as an assault on their faith and doggedly refuse to accept evolution because they fear it so utterly denies
God that it will lead them , and their children , straight into a world of moral depravity and meaninglessness .
An in - your - face atheist touting evolution , like Dawkins , is probably the last messenger they ’ll heed .
Dawkins will , however , be championed by many scientists , especially the most secular -- those who were galvanized by “ The God Delusion ” and inspired by it to take a newly confrontational approach toward America ’s religious majority .
They will help ensure Dawkins another literary success .
It ’s certainly valuable to have the case for evolution articulated prominently and often , but what this unending polarization around evolution and religion does for the standing of science in the U.S. is a very different matter .
It often appears as though Dawkins and his followers -- often dubbed the New Atheists , though some object to the term -- want to change the country ’s science community in a lasting way .
They ’d have scientists and defenders of reason be far more confrontational and blunt :
No more coddling the faithful , no tolerating nonscientific beliefs .
Scientific institutions , in their view , ought to stop putting out politic PR about science and religion being compatible .
Advertisement
The New Atheists win the battle easily on the Internet .
Their most prominent blogger , the University of Minnesota biologist P.Z. Myers , runs what is probably the Web ’s most popular science blog , Pharyngula , where he and his readers attack and belittle religious believers , sometimes using highly abrasive language .
Or as Myers put it to fanatical Catholics at one point : “ Do n’t confuse the fact that I find you and your church petty , foolish , twisted and hateful to be a testimonial to the existence of your petty , foolish , twisted , hateful god . ”
More moderate scientists , however -- let us call them the accommodationists -- still dominate the hallowed institutions of American science .
Personally , these scientists may be atheists , agnostics or believers ; whatever their views on the relationship between science and religion , politically , spiritually and practically they see no need to fight over it .
Thus the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences take the stance that science and religion can be perfectly compatible -- and are regularly blasted for it by the New Atheists .
Or as the National Academy of Sciences put it in a recent volume on evolution and creationism : “ Today , many religious denominations accept that biological evolution has produced the diversity of living things over billions of years of Earth ’s history .
...
Religious denominations that do not accept the occurrence of evolution tend to be those that believe in strictly literal interpretations of religious texts . ”
A smaller but highly regarded nonprofit organization called the National Center for Science Education has drawn at least as much of the New Atheists ’ ire , however .
Based in Oakland , the center is the leading organization that promotes and defends the teaching of evolution in school districts across the country .
Advertisement
In this endeavor , it has , of necessity , made frequent alliances with religious believers who also support the teaching of evolution , seeking to forge a broad coalition capable of beating back the advances of fundamentalists who want to weaken textbooks or science standards .
In the famous 2005 Dover , Pa. , evolution trial , for instance , the NCSE contributed scientific advice to a legal team that put a theologian and a Catholic biologist on the stand .
Long under fire from the religious right , the NCSE now must protect its other flank from the New Atheist wing of science .
The atheist biologist Jerry Coyne of the University of Chicago , for instance , has drawn much attention by assaulting the center ’s Faith Project , which seeks to spread awareness that between creationism on the one hand and the new atheism on the other lie many more moderate positions .
In this , Coyne is once again following the lead of Dawkins , who in “ The God Delusion ” denounces the NCSE as part of the “ Neville Chamberlain school of evolutionists , ” those equivocators who defend the science but refuse to engage with what the New Atheists perceive as the real root of the problem -- namely , religious belief .
It all might sound like a petty internecine squabble , but the stakes are very high .
The United States does not boast a very healthy relationship between its scientific community and its citizenry .
The statistics on public scientific illiteracy are notorious -- and they ’re at their worst on contentious , politicized issues such as climate change and the teaching of evolution .
About 46 % of Americans in polls agree with this stunning statement : “ God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so . ”
Advertisement
In this context , the New Atheists have chosen their course : confrontation .
And groups like the NCSE have chosen the opposite route :
Work with all who support the teaching of evolution regardless of their beliefs , and attempt to sway those who are uncertain but perhaps convincible .
Despite the resultant bitterness , however , there is at least one figure both sides respect -- the man who started it all : Charles Darwin .
What would he have done in this situation ?
It turns out that late in life , when an atheist author asked permission to dedicate a book to Darwin , the great scientist wrote back his apologies and declined .
For as Darwin put it , “ Though I am a strong advocate for free thought on all subjects , yet it appears to me ( whether rightly or wrongly ) that direct arguments against Christianity & theism produce hardly any effect on the public ; & freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men ’s minds , which follows from the advance of science . ”
Darwin and Dawkins differ by much more than a few letters , then -- something the New Atheists ought to deeply consider .

Bobby Kotick of Activision has threatened that if Sony does not drop the price of the PS3 , that they will drop support for all Sony platforms .
This news comes courtesy of Times Online .
Kotick had this to say on the matter of the PS3 .
“ I ’m getting concerned about Sony ; the PlayStation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they do n’t make it easy for me to support the platform .
It ’s expensive to develop for the console , and the Wii and the Xbox are just selling better .
Games generate a better return on invested capital on the Xbox than on the PlayStation ”
Kotick then went on about the price of the PS3 , and how they need to lower it .
“ They have to cut the price , because if they do n’t , the attach rates [ the number of games each console owner buys ] are likely to slow .
If we are being realistic , we might have to stop supporting Sony .
When we look at 2010 and 2011 , we might want to consider if we support the console — and the PSP [ portable ] too . ”
Unfortunately for Sony , losing a publisher as big as Activison would be a huge loss for the company .
Remember , Activision holds such key franchises as Guitar Hero and Call of Duty .
Guitar
Hero alone grossed more than $ 1 billion dollars last year .
What do you think on this matter ?
Post your thoughts and feelings below .
Update : Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has responded to Activision ’s threat :
“ We respect our third - parties ’ opinions and their right to express those opinions but we will not be commenting on this story . ”

A guest commentary by Kyle Swanson – University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee
I am quite humbled by the interest that has been generated by our paper “ Has the climate recently shifted ? ” ( Swanson and Tsonis , 2009 ) , and would like the thank the RealClimate editors for the opportunity to give my perspective on this piece .
Before delving into the paper itself , a few words about the place of our work in the global warming “ debate ” are in order .
A quote from the early 20th century Viennese polymath Egon Friedell ( which I ran across in the wonderful book Cultural Amnesia by Clive James ) captures the situation better than any words I could ever weave ;
Electricity and magnetism are those forces of nature by which people who know nothing about electricity and magnetism can explain everything .
Substitute the words “ modes of natural climate variability ” for “ electricity and magnetism , ” and well … , hopefully the point is made .
It first needs to be emphasized that natural variability and radiatively forced warming are not competing in some no -holds barred scientific smack down as explanations for the behavior of the global mean temperature over the past century .
Both certainly played a role in the evolution of the temperature trajectory over the 20th century , and significant issues remain to be resolved about their relative importance .
However , the salient point , one that is oftentimes not clear in arguments about variability in the climate system , is that all else being equal , climate variability and climate sensitivity are flip sides of the same coin .
( see also the post Natural Variability and Climate Sensitivity )
A climate that is highly sensitive to radiative forcing ( i.e. , responds very strongly to increasing greenhouse gas forcing ) by definition will be unable to quickly dissipate global mean temperature anomalies arising from either purely natural dynamical processes or stochastic radiative forcing , and hence will have significant internal variability .
The opposite also holds .
It ’s painfully easy to paint oneself logically into a corner by arguing that either ( i ) vigorous natural variability caused 20th century climate change , but the climate is insensitive to radiative forcing by greenhouse gases ; or ( ii ) the climate is very sensitive to greenhouse gases , but we still are able to attribute details of inter-decadal wiggles in the global mean temperature to a specific forcing cause .
Of course , both could be wrong if the climate is not behaving as a linear forced ( stochastic + GHG ) system .
With that in mind , our paper is fundamentally about inter-decadal variability in the climate system and its role in the evolution of the 20th century climate trajectory , as well as in near - future climate change .
The climate system has well known modes of variability , such as the El Niño / Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) and North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) , that are active on inter-annual time scales .
We are interested in how this short time - scale ( from the climate perspective ! ) variability impacts climate anomalies over multi-decadal time periods .
What we find is that when interannual modes of variability in the climate system have what I ’ll refer to as an “ episode , ” shifts in the multi- decadal global mean temperature trend appear to occur .
I ’ll leave the details of these episodes to interested readers ( here and here ) , as things get pretty technical .
It ’s sufficient to note that we have an objective criteria for what defines an episode ; we are n’t just eyeballing curves .
The climate system appears to have had three distinct “ episodes ” during the 20th century ( during the 1910 ’s , 1940 ’s , and 1970 ’s ) , and all three marked shifts in the trend of the global mean temperature , along with changes in the qualitative character of ENSO variability .
We have also found similar types of shifts in a number of model simulations ( both forced and unforced ) that were run in support of the IPCC AR4 report .
The contentious part of our paper is that the climate system appears to have had another “ episode ” around the turn of the 21st century , coinciding with the much discussed “ halt ” in global warming .
Whether or not such a halt has really occurred is of course controversial ( it appears quite marked in the HadCRUT3 data , less so in GISTEMP ) ; only time will tell if it ’s real .
Regardless , it ’s important to note that we are not talking about global cooling , just a pause in warming .
What ’s our perspective on how the climate will behave in the near future ?
The HadCRUT3 global mean temperature to the right shows the post -1980 warming , along with the “ plateau ” in global mean temperature post -1998 .
Also shown is a linear trend using temperatures over the period 1979 - 1997 ( no cherry picking here ; pick any trend that does n’t include the period 1998 - 2008 ) .
We hypothesize that the established pre-1998 trend is the true forced warming signal , and that the climate system effectively overshot this signal in response to the 1997/98 El Niño .
This overshoot is in the process of radiatively dissipating , and the climate will return to its earlier defined , greenhouse gas - forced warming signal .
If this hypothesis is correct , the era of consistent record - breaking global mean temperatures will not resume until roughly 2020 .
Of course , this contrasts sharply with other forecasts of the climate system ; the purple line roughly indicates the model - based forecast of Smith et al. ( 2007 ) , suggesting with a warming of roughly 0.3 deg C over the 2005 - 2015 period .
Why would anyone in their right mind believe what I ’ve just outlined ?
Everything hinges on the idea that something extraordinary happened to the climate system in response to the 1997/98 super - El Niño event ( an idea that has its roots in the wavelet analysis by Park and Mann ( 2000 ) ) .
The figure to the left shows the spatial mean temperature over all grid boxes in the HadCRUT3 data set that have continuous monthly coverage over the 1901 - 2008 period .
While this provides a skewed view of the global mean , as it is heavily weighted toward North America , Europe and coastal areas , unlike the global mean temperature it has the cardinal virtue of being a consistent record with respect to time .
The sole exclusion in the figure is the line connecting the 1997 and 1998 temperatures .
Now , anomalous behavior is always in the eye of the beholder .
However , the jump in temperature between 1997 and 1998 in this record certainly appears to pass the “ smell test ” ( better than 3 standard deviations of interannual variability ) for something out of the ordinary .
Nor is this behavior dependent on the underlying time interval chosen , as the same basic picture emerges for any starting time up until the 1980 ’s , provided you look at locations that have continuous coverage over your interval .
Again , as the temperature anomaly associated with this jump dissipates , we hypothesize that the climate system will return to its signal as defined by its pre-1998 behavior in roughly 2020 and resume warming .
What do our results have to do with Global Warming , i.e. , the century - scale response to greenhouse gas emissions ?
VERY LITTLE , contrary to claims that others have made on our behalf .
Nature ( with hopefully some constructive input from humans ) will decide the global warming question based upon climate sensitivity , net radiative forcing , and oceanic storage of heat , not on the type of multi-decadal time scale variability we are discussing here .
However , this apparent impulsive behavior explicitly highlights the fact that humanity is poking a complex , nonlinear system with GHG forcing – and that there are no guarantees to how the climate may respond .

LONDON – Psychopaths who kill and rape have faulty connections between the part of the brain dealing with emotions and that which handles impulses and decision - making , scientists have found .
In a study of psychopaths who had committed murder , manslaughter , multiple rape , strangulation and false imprisonment , the British scientists found that roads linking the two crucial brain areas had " potholes " , while those of non-psychopaths were in good shape .
The study opens up the possibility of developing treatments for dangerous psychopaths in the future , said Dr Michael Craig of the Institute of Psychiatry at London 's King 's College London , and may have profound implications for doctors , researchers and the criminal justice system .
" These were particular serious offenders with psychopathy and without any other mental illnesses , " he told Reuters in an interview .
" Essentially what we found is that the connections in the psychopaths were not as good as the connections in the non-psychopaths .
I would describe them as roads between the two areas -- and we found that in the psychopaths , the roads had potholes and were n't very well maintained . "
The scientists cautioned against suggestions the study could lead to screening of potential psychopathic criminals before they are able to commit crimes , saying their findings had not established how , when or why the brain links were damaged .
" The most exciting question now ... is when do the potholes come -- are people born with them , do they develop early in life , or are they a consequence of something else ? "
Psychopathic extremes have been portrayed in Hollywood blockbusters by characters like the serial killer and cannibal Hannibal Lecter .
Psychopaths often violate social norms , are manipulative , impulsive and sensation - seeking , and appear to feel no empathy or remorse .
Craig , who conducted the study , published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry with colleagues Declan Murphy and Dr Marco Catani , stressed that the numbers in brain scan study were small , with only nine psychopaths analysed and compared with nine non-psychopaths .
" Trying to get people of this particular type to take part in a study , and also then deal with all the security you need to get them into a brain scanner , is not an easy feat , " he said .
The study used a new brain imaging technology to further analyse psychopaths ' brains after previous studies found that the amygdala part of the brain , which processes emotions , and orbitofrontal cortex , which handles impulses and decisions , are structurally and functionally different in psychopaths .
" Up until recently the technology has n't been available to look at the connections between those two brain areas in any meaningful way , " Craig said .
But a new technique , called diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ( DT - MRI ) , allowed the researchers to look at the white matter tract linking the two key brain areas .

As well as finding clear structural deficits in the tract in psychopathic brains , they also found the degree of abnormality was significantly linked to the degree of psychopathy .
" As for the moral significance for society , and how society wants to deal with these things , that is a little premature , " said Craig .
" This is a small study and the important thing it raises is that more research needs to be done . "
Do I look flat in this ?

WE LIVE in a special time .
For the past two decades , most of my colleagues and I have been working under the assumption that we can know everything about the universe .
We know the amount of matter and energy it contains .
We know its shape is flat .
We can trace its history from the earliest moments after the big bang and we can even predict its fate .
Or at least we thought we could .
Why were we so confident ?
Exquisite measurements of the radiation left over from the big bang led us to believe that we could work out the curvature of the universe to within a few per cent .
In doing so , we have determined how much energy the universe contains and that most of it is in an exotic form called dark energy , which is driving the expansion of space .
However , recent discoveries have left me wondering if these claims were premature .
As we learn more about dark energy and its effect on the expansion of space and time , we find that dark energy and the shape , or geometry , of the universe are worryingly intertwined .
By changing our assumptions about dark energy we can radically modify our constraints on the shape of the universe .
Equally , without a much more precise measurement of the geometry , it is impossible to determine the nature and evolution of dark energy .
Our picture of the universe has , to some extent , been blown wide open again .
This state of affairs has serious implications for how we proceed in our exploration of the universe .
A host …
Depressions Take Time
Everything is working out just like we thought it would .
The stock market is performing as expected .
The economy is on track .
Even the politicians are doing what they thought they would .
Let ’s begin with the stimulus / bailout / boondoggle / BS plan .
As anticipated , it has failed .
That is , the economy is getting worse , not better .
It has failed the test set for it by its own creators .
Back when the Obama Team was arguing for a big bailout bill , it warned that without a bailout , unemployment would rise above 8 % in 2009 .
‘ Pass this bill today , ’ said Ben Bernanke , or words to that effect , ‘ or there may not be a tomorrow for the US economy . ’
Congress dutifully bent its back to the task of adding boondoggles to the bill and then okayed the measure .
And here we are , in the middle of 2009 , and the unemployment rate is already at 9.4 % .
Even at the time , it was obvious that the hacks in the administration had no idea what was going on .
They were just guessing about the economy and taking advantage of the situation to pass out more money that taxpayers had n’t even earned yet .
As predicted , the spending did n’t make the situation better ; if anything , it probably made it worse – by delaying the process of destruction , and hence retarding the process of creative reconstruction too .
We recall our other forecast too : when the bailout does n’t work , they ’ll pass another one .
And so , in yesterday ’s New York Times , there is David Leonhardt urging the pols to even bigger acts of absurdity :
“ The economy really may need more help , ” he says .
Yes , it will need more help .
Especially if it keeps getting the kind of help it ’s been getting .
The stock market is acting more or less as we thought it would too .
The big bounce began on the 9th of March .
It ’s been almost four months now …and the bounce should be getting near its peak … and beginning to fall again .
Just look at a chart of the Dow since March .
You ’ll see exactly that .
Like a cannonball , it went up … and now it seems to be arching over for its fall to the ground .
As stocks roll over , the economic news rolls over too .
Yesterday ’s issue of USA Today featured a report that said small businesses are going broke faster than expected .
Small businesses are supposed to be the survivors .
Like mammals in the Ice Age , they replace the dinosaurs .
In a recession , big , costly , inflexible companies are supposed to get hit the hardest … leaving niches for small , nimble , low - cost competitors to slip into .
These small businesses establish toeholds during the recession … hire people … and then scale up to the peak of commerce when the boom comes .
But this time it ’s different .
Small businesses are collapsing along with big ones .
In April , for example , more than small 8,000 businesses went broke and filed for Chapter 11 .
In addition to the business bankruptcies are the personal bankruptcies .
According to the Los Angeles Times , the rate of personal bankruptcy is soaring in Southern California .
In April , according to David Rosenberg at Gluskin Sheff , the feds added $ 121 million ( at an annual rate ) in total stimulus to the consumer economy – including tax reduction and increased benefits .
In May , the total stimulus rose to $ 163 million .
How come so many bankruptcies when the feds were giving away so much money ?
The answer , says Rosenberg , is that consumers did n’t spend the money ; they saved it .
Consumer spending rose just $ 1 billion April – despite $ 121 billion of stimulus .
In May it rose $ 25 billion – despite a ‘ stimulus ’ 6 times that amount .
Meanwhile , the saving rate , which had been only 0.2 % in March of 2008 exploded to nearly 7 % in May 2009 .
No consumer spending , no sales .
No sales , no revenues .
No revenues … no one can stay in business .
No small businesses .
No new jobs .
No new jobs , no economic recovery .
No economic recovery and the meddlers are back on the Hill asking for more power and money .
No surprise there .
Depressions take time .
Bankruptcy rates do n’t rise overnight .
First , it takes businesses a while to realize their sales are falling .
At first , they think it might be a fluke .
Then , they talk to friends and read the papers .
And then , the next month confirms the story .
Then , it takes time for them to react .
They have to figure out where they can make cuts .
Typically , this involves layoffs and job losses .
Employees who will be let go need to be identified .
Then , they actually have to be sent home .
Then , the employee collects benefits .
He looks for another job .
He draws down savings .
It takes time for him to react too .
He watches .
He notices that it is hard to find another job .
He realizes his resources are running out .
He begins to cut back .
Unnecessary expenses are eliminated .
Then , he broadens his definition of ‘ unnecessary . ’
Finally , he lacks the money for the essentials .
The mortgage goes unpaid .
Credit card deadlines are missed .
This provokes an inevitable response – warnings , more warnings , official action , and finally … defaults , foreclosures and bankruptcy filings .
We came back to Paris last night to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary .
It was n’t much of a celebration … just a simple dinner for two in a simple restaurant in the old Palais Royale .
It was a hot day in Paris .
We sat outside in the galleries of the old palace .
Near to us was another couple .
Middle aged , they seemed like people who were getting together for the first time , not a couple who had been married for a long time .
The man reminded us of John Malkovich .
The woman ?
She was not an especially attractive woman , with straight gray / black hair cut as short as a man’s .
They held hands .
They looked into each other ’s eyes .
They seemed to be making plans for a happy future .
When you ’ve been married for a long time , on the other hand , you have to wonder if your happiness is not more past tense than future .
You can recall the happy times you spent together …how the children were when they were little …how much fun you had when you were poor and starting out in life … and all you went through together to get to where you are now .
But when you look ahead , your weary eyes fail .
You may feel as though you ’ve said all you had to say – and agreed to disagree .
You may feel as though the grand adventure of your lives has peaked out – like a bull market – with nothing but the downward slope left for you .
You may feel that the great mystery of coupling has been revealed .
Getting to know someone and getting together …even fusing your flesh , blood and spirit to form fully new human beings … is there anything left to discover ?
Are there more surprises coming ?
Inevitably , the conversation turned towards the sovereign state of South Carolina .
The poor state has a jackass for a governor .
Mark Sanford has become a laughingstock for the entire nation .
Not because he had an illicit dalliance and lied about it – who can honestly say he has n’t done that ?
– but because he is a cad .
And the worst kind of cad – the kind who pretends to be sensitive and caring .
He ’s found true love , he says , with an Argentine beauty .
But rather than dump his wife and fly to his heartthrob …he dumps the love of his life and tells his wife that he will try to fall back in love with her .
The bonehead betrays them all – his wife , his lover …and love itself .
He ’s even given romance a bad name .
Meeting a woman who looks like Penelope Cruz on a dance floor in South America has an undeniable romantic appeal .
When the story broke , there must have been hundreds of lonely middle - aged men in America booking their tickets and looking forward to tango .
The Mark and Maria affair might have made the history books of star - crossed love , along with Tristan and Iseult , Antony and Cleopatra , Brad and Jennifer .
But now , a week later , we know what kind of man Mark really is .
Cancel the tickets .
Any man who falls in love from now will feel like a sap .
As for us , we ’ve been saps all our lives .
Eventually , we ’ll head for the romance of Buenos Aires too .
But we ’ll take our main squeeze with us , just to see what happens next .
Until tomorrow ,
Bill Bonner

Trivia
Did you know that " Balibo " is also a 2009 film by Robert Connolly , starring Anthony LaPaglia and Oscar Isaac ?
The film is about a group of journalists that were captured and later killed during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975 .
The film was named after the town of Balibo in East Timor , where the journalists were detained .
For more information about the Balibo movie , you can check the film 's page on IMDB : Balibo ( 2009 )
Israeli settler groups have set up 11 new outposts in the occupied West Bank , in a direct rebuttal of mounting US calls to freeze settlement activity .
Young Jewish groups are reported to have set up the structures – mostly tents and huts on hilltops – in the West Bank over Monday night , in a move timed as a precursor to the meeting between the US special envoy , George Mitchell , and Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu today .
On Monday , hundreds of settlers set up an outpost near the Palestinian village of Tulkarem , reportedly without intervention from the Israeli army .
Settler groups said they were mimicking the fabled activities of 1946 , when the area was ruled by British mandate and 11 Jewish outposts were defiantly erected in the Negev desert during one night .
The mostly young Israelis are associated with settler organisations such as Youth for Israel , a militant group set up in response to Israel 's evacuation of settlements in the Gaza Strip in 2005 .
According to the Jerusalem Post , settlers were canvassing support and distributing flyers over the weekend at existing settlements in the West Bank – which , like the outposts , are illegal under international law .
One flyer read : " The nations of the world do not want us here and we are responding by strengthening the connection to the land and by establishing new communities . "
Haaretz newspaper reported that 40 teenage girls spent three days in an established West Bank outpost in " spiritual preparation " for the " relentless battle on the right to settle the Land of Israel " .
One 16 - year - old girl from Tel Aviv told the paper : " I do n't know if I personally would live in an outpost but it contributes to the entire people of Israel that the land is being settled . "
Today , the Israeli army chief of staff , Gabi Ashkenazi , said he had not received orders to prepare for the evacuation of outposts in the West Bank .
Netanyahu and Mitchell said they had made progress in their meeting in Jerusalem to discuss the settlements issue , but reported no firm development .

At home in London , Lisa Midwinter packs for a journey into her past .
Four days during which she , her son , and her granddaughter will relive her childhood experiences .
Four days to retrace her route out of Nazi- occupied Czechoslovakia , and to meet the man whose actions saved her life .
In 1938 , Nicholas Winton , then a young stockbroker , was due to go skiing with friends in Switzerland when he received a phone call urging him to change his plans and visit Prague , where an emergency was unfolding .
I think there is nothing that can't be done if it is fundamentally reasonable
The caller was his friend Martin Blake , a master at Westminster School and an ambassador for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia , which was helping adults escape .
Two months earlier , Hitler 's troops had occupied the disputed territory of Sudetenland , on Czechoslovakia 's border with Germany , driving thousands from their homes .
In other countries , refugee organisations had begun organising the " Kindertransports " - a series of trains carrying thousands of Jewish children out of central Europe .
But no such plan existed in Czechoslovakia .
After visiting refugee camps outside Prague , Winton realised he had to act quickly .
" I found out the children of refugees and other groups of people who were enemies of Hitler were n't being looked after .
I decided to try to get permits to Britain for them .

More from BBC World Service " Everybody in Prague said , ' Look , there is no organisation in Prague to deal with refugee children , nobody will let the children go on their own , but if you want to have a go , have a go ' .
" And I think there is nothing that can't be done if it is fundamentally reasonable . "
Concentration camps
After recruiting a team to organise a new series of trains , Winton returned to the UK to find homes for as many children as possible .
Between March and August 1939 , eight Winton trains carried 669 children to safety ; the last train , with 250 children on board , was due to leave on 1 September - the day war broke out .
See the route taken by the Winton train
At the last minute , German troops intervened ; the children were never seen again .
They , and most of the families left behind , were transported east to the concentration camps .
Vera Gissing 's two cousins were on that train but instead of England , they ended up in Belsen .
They , along with her mother , never made it out of the camp .
The 10 - year - old ended up in Bootle , Lancashire , while her sister Eva was sent to a boarding school in Bournemouth .
Their parents tried to keep smiling as the train pulled out , and she can remember shouting : " See you again in a free Czechoslovakia " .
I remember this feeling of being all alone in a totally foreign place
Alf Dubs , a former minister in the Blair cabinet , was another of " Winton 's children " .
The six - year - old was met at Liverpool Street train station by his father , who had left Prague the day the Nazis arrived .
Lord Dubs said Winton , who is now Sir Nicholas , was a " phenomenal individual , one of the really great human beings " .
" Without any doubt I owe my life to him .
I think my chance of surviving and that of the others would have been pretty slim . "
' Why me ? '
Lisa Midwinter , originally Lisa Dasch , was three when she made the journey to England with her brother .
Born in Teplice , near the German border , the well - heeled family were on holiday when they received word not to return home but head straight to Prague .
" I remember this great big black object as high as you could see .
I remember figures in blue , which must have been the train driver , singing and handkerchiefs , and terrific noise .
Germany invaded Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939 " I remember handkerchiefs being waved and crying , and seeing grown - ups crying . "
At the end of the journey , Ms Midwinter said she felt " totally desolate with a card on the front me " .
" I remember this feeling of being all alone in a totally foreign place . "
She was initially taken to stay with a dentist 's family in Manchester but they could not cope with her because she was in " such a state " .
A friend of her mother 's in Stoke - on - Trent agreed to take her in , and Ms Midwinter 's first happy memories of England involve " being picked up to post letters through a red letter box " .
Her story has a happy ending as her parents made it out and settled in Stoke - on - Trent , where they acted as surrogate parents for many Czech children .
Like many of the evacuees , Ms Midwinter only learned about Sir Nicholas many years later through a television programme .
When she met him , she naturally asked ' " Why me ? "
" He said because you 'd have been the first to go ... that we were a middle class Jewish family and the Germans would have got rid of us first . "

This week she will board a train to meet old friends and face her memories .
More than 100 people will travel between Prague and London ; among them 20 of Winton 's children , now with children and grandchildren of their own .
Ms Midwinter is determined that her family should understand how much they owe to Sir Nicholas , and gain a glimpse of the agony faced by Czech parents who knew they were seeing their children for the last time .
But above all that they should understand they are part of an extraordinary worldwide family which owes its existence to the man who , at the age of 100 , will once again stand on the platform at Liverpool Street to welcome them .

A Chinese national was indicted this week for conspiring to violate U.S. export law , following a nearly three - year investigation into his alleged efforts to acquire sensitive military and NSA - encryption gear from eBay and other internet sources .
Chi Tong Kuok , of Macau , told Defense Department and Customs investigators that he had been " acting at the direction of officials for the People 's Republic of China , " according to a government affidavit in the case .
" Kuok indicated he and PRC officials sought the items to figure out ways to listen to or monitor U.S. government and military communications . "
Kuok was arrested at the Atlanta International Airport last month en route from Paris to Panama , where he allegedly planned to meet an undercover federal agent he believed was going to provide him with military radios .
He was transferred to California , where he was indicted ( .pdf ) Tuesday for money laundering , conspiracy , smuggling and one count of attempting to export a defense article without a license .
The U.S. began investigating Kuok in December 2006 , when , using the first of many aliases , the man allegedly e-mailed a contact in the defense industry in search of software for a VDC - 300 airborne data controller , used for secure satellite communications from American military aircraft .
The contact referred Kuok to an undercover agent in San Diego , who began negotiating with Kuok over a shopping list of military technology that eventually grew to at least 43 different items , ranging from a GPS receiver with anti-spoofing defenses , to the NSA - developed AN / CYZ - 10 crypto key management device .
Kuok repeatedly expressed fears that he might be dealing with an NSA , CIA or FBI agent , but continued to negotiate with the undercover officer , even cautioning him to avoid referencing the items by model number in e-mail , because " your country has this system to analyze " e-mail for keywords .
Last March , the government says , a genuine U.S. source sold Kuok two export - restricted PRC - 148 handheld digital military radios for $ 8,000 , shipping them to Kuok 's address in Macau , and accepting payment over Western Union .
Using a Yahoo e-mail address and a different name , Kuok also allegedly contacted an Arizona company this year that had posted on eBay a KG - 175 TACLANE – an NSA designed encryption device used to communicate with classified military computer networks , such as the Defense Department 's SIPRNet .
It 's legal to own the equipment , which can't access anything without the proper crypto key , but export is tightly restricted .
The Arizona company initially refused to ship the NSA gear to Macau , but at the government 's request , later allowed another undercover agent to negotiate a deal with Kuok while posing as a company official .
" In subsequent e-mails , Kuok indicated he was interested in buying the KG - 175 if it came with a particular key , " reads an affidavit by John Helsing of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service , who does not elaborate .
Kuok allegedly sent the undercover agent $ 1,700 by Western Union for the crypto device , and then forwarded a list of additional items he wanted .
" I am also thinking about if you are FBI or something like that , " Kuok allegedly wrote in an e-mail .
Despite his misgivings , Kuok sent the agent another $ 10,000 for more PRC - 148 radios .
" When you send the radios , remove all label and write it as vintage walkie talkie , thank you , " he allegedly instructed .
The undercover agent and Kuok agreed to meet in Panama to complete the delivery .
Unfortunately for Kuok , his plane stopped in Atlanta , where he was arrested and held without bail .
Investigators reviewed Kuok 's eBay and PayPal accounts and determined he had successfully purchased other export - controlled items online , beginning in 2005 .
On Wednesday , the government obtained search warrants for two USB flash drives , a laptop computer and several cell phones Kuok had in his carry - on bag , as well as for a cell phone SIM card in his possession .
" Kuok claimed in his post - arrest interview that his PRC ' handlers (s ) ' gave him a SIM card and instructed him to place it in his phone once he landed in Panama , " wrote Helsing in his affidavit .

Lee Warren over at Royal Reflections has become a champion for Kids ’ Day at the K .
You can read his initial post and updates here , here , and here .
Royals Review has also taken up the effort , click here .
Please consider donating to the cause to help some youngsters take in a Royals game that otherwise might not have a chance to do so .
We all have fond memories of games we went to as kids and , in my humble opinion , all kids should have a chance at those memories .
If you decide to donate , make sure you mention that you are part of the Royal Reflections pool to ensure that donations from KoK readers add to the efforts already made by the other sites .
Instructions and details have been provided on the other two sites , but I ’ll include them here as well .
For every $ 10.00 that is donated , one child gets to attend the game on August 9 when the Royals play Oakland at 1:10 pm .
You can pick the charity of your choice or you can allow the Royals to pick one — they will choose the Boys and Girls Club or the Official Royals Charities .
If you have a preference , just tell Adam when you contact him .
If you ’d like to know more , please contact Adam ( his contact info is below ) .
But basically , the way it works is , if we can get people to buy at least 25 tickets , then the Royals begin to match tickets .
I ’d love to see Royals ’ fans send at least 10 kids to the game .
If you ’d like to participate , please contact Adam directly : Adam Cain , Inside Sales , KC Royals
Phone : 816.504.4176
Email : adam.cain@royals.com
I emailed Adam this week , and he is happy to help us out here .
You can call him at the number listed above and give him credit card information for your donation .
Or you can mail a check .
The address for checks is
Kauffman Stadium Attn : Adam Cain
One Royal Way
Kansas City , MO 64129
( If you do mail a check , be sure to also call or email Adam and let him know you have done so .
This way they can have a general idea of how many seats / tickets they need to have ready .
According to Adam , checks can be made out to the Kansas City Royals . )
Let him know that you are coming from Royal Reflections so he can keep track of how much money we raise and so I ’ll be able to come back and let you know how many kids will get to attend the game on August 9 because of your generosity .
Again , if we get to $ 250 dollars raised , the Royals will match us , which means another 25 tickets will be bought , good for 50 total .
Just remember though , every $ 10 dollars equals another ticket .
Thanks for taking the time to read this Kings of Kauffman public service announcement .
If voting could change anything ...
it would be illegal
IT'S LOCAL ELECTION time and as usual politicians of all parties will be promising us wonderful things .
It 's probable that this election will also show an increased vote for the Labour Party .
Yet it is fair enough to ask " what difference will it make " .
We are used to being promised the sun , moon and stars in elections only to receive cuts , cuts and cuts .
Is this just because all politicians are liars or are there deeper reasons ?
Abstention from elections has been an anarchist tactic from the time of Bakunin .
In this article we look at some of the reasons anarchists advocate abstention / spoilt votes .
The right to the vote was part of the hard won struggles of workers ( and suffragettes ! ) over the last couple of hundred years .
Obviously it is preferable to live in a parliamentary democracy rather than a dictatorship .
Even the most flawed democracies are forced to concede rights that dictatorships do not , such as relative independence for trade unions , the right to limited demonstrations , a certain amount of free speech , etc .
However it is clear that none of these are absolutes , as anti-trade union legislation , Section 31 and the refusal to allow nationalist marches into Belfast city centre adequately demonstrate .
The amount of freedom is set by how much the bosses need to give to keep the system flowing , plus the amount that is forced from them through the struggle of workers .
The real purpose of parliament is not to ensure the country is run according to the wishes of all the people , cherishing all their views equally .
Parliament instead provides a democratic facade beyond which the real business of managing capitalism goes on .
The Goodman affair and the bailing out of Insurance Corporation of Ireland a few years back demonstrate how the real decisions are made in the boardrooms of the large industrial concerns .
In the unlikely event of a government being elected which goes " too far " in the eyes of the bosses they are quick to use any means necessary to remove it .
BEHIND THE FACADE
The best known example of this is perhaps the removal of the democratically elected Allende government in Chile in 1972 .
They had attempted to bring in a limited package of reforms and nationalise some of the larger American industries .
The result was a military coup backed by the CIA .
The workers in Chile were politically disarmed by their reliance on a small group of elected deputies to liberate them .
There was little organised resistance to the military and in the immediate aftermath over 30,000 militants were executed and 1,000,000 fled into exile .
In practise however capitalism seldom finds need for such methods , their complete control of the media and the reliance of the political parties on big business for funds is enough of a check .
Organisations like the Irish and British Labour Parties spend most of their time trying to prove they can manage capitalism just as well as the Tories or Fianna Fáil .
They argue their policies are a way of avoiding strikes and any other form of class strife .
They say their politics of class collaboration are more efficient to capitalism then a hard headed class strife approach of lock - outs and union busting .
To the bosses this is often a good argument , sometimes it is worth handing out a few crumbs in return for industrial peace .
At other times when a serious crisis necessitates a driving down of wages or living standards they can always either force this government to implement the cuts , precipitate a general election or - in extreme cases - turn to a police states .
P.E.S.P. LOGIC
This sort of logic has nothing to do with socialism .
Indeed the current Fianna Fáil / PD government has been successfully pursuing the same logic through the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and before that the PNR .
These deals mean the union bureaucrats actively stopping and sabotaging strikes in return for pay increases below the rate of inflation .
So in a comparative ' boom ' period of the Irish economy when company profits doubled Irish workers made real losses with regards to wages and employment and lost ground as regards the social wage ( health care , education , etc ) .
The Labour and Workers Parties may have objected to parts of the PESP but they supported the idea of ' social partnership ' as it is part of their strategy for government as well .
There are times of course when more radical reformist governments are elected ( in other countries if not as yet in Ireland ) .
These included Spain in 1936 and the post war British Labour government .
The function of these governments however was to lead the working class away from the road to social revolution , to suggest the same gains could be made through parliament .
When put to the test however in the Spanish case by the fascist coup the government preferred negotiation with the fascists to arming the working class .
In Spain the initial resistance to fascism was carried out by the militant workers of the anarchist C.N.T. who seized arms or attacked fascist barracks with dynamite and shotguns .
A similar example is seen throughout Europe in the immediate aftermath of the Russian revolution as the reformists in one country after another stood on the basis that electing them would prevent revolution .
Vote for us and save capitalism .
Unfortunately at such times such parties often gain mass support , this is why it is vital anarchists take up the arguments around reformism rather than assuming such ideas will just fade away with the revolution .
GOOD LEADERS ?
These arguments are common to most revolutionary socialists , but anarchists have another and more fundamental reason for opposing the parliamentary process .
This process involves the mass of the working class relying on a few representatives to enter parliament and do battle on their behalf .
Their sole involvement is one of voting every few years and perhaps canvassing and supporting the party through paper sales or whatever .
A reliance on a physical leader or leaders from Neil Kinnock to Mary Robinson to sort out the situation for us .
Anarchists do not belive any real socialist / anarchist society can come about through the good actions of a few individuals .
From the beginnings of the anarchist movement around the International Working Mens ' ( sic ) Association ( better known as the ' First International ' ) over a century ago , we have argued that the liberation of the working class can only be achieved through the action of the working class .
At the time this argument was with the Marxists , now with the collapse of many major Marxist parties in the wake of the collapse of Eastern Europe it is mainly with reformists .
The process of bringing about an anarchist society will either be carried through by the mass of the workers or it will not happen .
This idea is obviously the complete opposite to the parliamentary idea .
We do not seek a few leaders , good , bad or indifferent to sort out the mess that is capitalism .
Indeed we argue constantly against any ideas that make it seem such elites are necessary .
Parliamentary politics relies on voting for people because they are going to do the job ( or some of it ) for you .
Even the best intentioned individual on receiving a position of power finds a divergence of interests with those she / he represents .
This is as much true of revolutionaries and union bureaucrats as it is of ministers and prime ministers .
MAKING THE ARGUMENTS
This brings us to the question of how should anarchists tackle the parliamentary system .
How do we convince everyone not to vote ?
Perhaps we should put all our energy into anti-election campaigns .
In fact this is not seen as a major activity by most anarchists at all .
Our aim is not to have elections where only 10 % vote , for such a thing would be meaningless in itself .
In the U.S.A. only about 30 % vote in most elections and it is possible that up to 50 % of the population is not even registered to vote .
Only a fool however would claim this meant the U.S. was more anarchist then Ireland .
If that 10 % or 30 % is still electing the government it might as well be 99 % .
Our aim is to change society by winning the working class to the ideas and tactics of anarchism .
This will involve the overthrow of the economic system ( capitalism ) we live under and its replacement with socialism under workers ' self - management .
Not voting may just be a sign of despair ( " What 's the point " ) , we want workers actively struggling for the alternative .
Our anti-electoralism is designed to say two things .
Firstly that parliament is not the real seat of power in society .
Secondly that the task of bringing in anarchism is for the working class , not some small group of TD's .
We will gain support for anarchist ideas not just through abstract propaganda but also by our involvement as anarchists in workers ' struggles and demonstrating how anarchism provides the best tools for winning day to day reforms .
REFORMIST WORKERS
Most of the active militants in the working class support reformist parties , this is an obvious fact .
This has led many revolutionary groups to adopt slogans at election times telling workers to " vote Labour with no illusions " or " vote Labour but build a socialist alternative " .
We do n't .
The problems with both these slogans are they still reflect the idea that change should be brought about be the small elites .
They are normally defended by saying this is putting the reformist parties to the test so that they can be exposed to their supporters .
This is a nonsense , as a brief look at any of the Irish left reformist organisations shows .
The reformist organisations have failed the ' test ' on dozens of occasions .
Workers vote for these organisations not because they believe they will introduce socialism but because they are seen to offer the best of the bad deal that is capitalism .
This is also presented as an argument for voting for the reformist parties .
Is it not ultra - left to refuse to support these parties while they may be slightly better than Fianna Fail or Fine Gael ?
Two answers exist to this .
The first is that as the real decision making takes place in industry and not in parliament these organisations even in majority government can only do what capitalism allows them .
Their only argument is to organise capitalism more " humanly " .
We want to smash capitalism , not give it a human face .
The sight of a " socialist government " implementing cuts and breaking strikes damages the credibility of socialism in the eyes of workers , as did the existence of the " socialist " police states of eastern Europe .
Secondly , it is a question of energy .
The sort of effort that is spent supporting ( critically or otherwise ) reformist organisation is energy taken away from the struggles for improved working conditions , better wages etc .
Elections do not take place in a vacuum in which nothing else takes place in society for a number of months .
A strike or demonstration of thousands of workers has more chance of effecting real change then 20 Labour or Workers party TD's .
In times of mass unrest energy pumped into reformist parties will be energy used to undermine the revolution .
As so many Chilean socialists found , revolutionaries supporting such organisations are likely to find the are literally digging their own grave .
EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE
There are occasions where anarchists might support individuals standing in elections .
This is when such people stand on a single issue and abstensionist basis .
At times this may be an effective way of showing mass support for something when faced with a massive hype against it from the capitalist press .
Other forms of demonstrating support may be difficult due to large scale intimidation , victimisation of activists , etc .
One example of such an occasion in the Irish context was the H - Block hunger strikes of 1981 for political status .
The election of Bobby Sands as MP for Fermanagh / South Tyrone and the election of two more H - Block prisoners as TD 's south of the border demonstrated a mass support for the hunger strikers .
It undermined government and press claims that they had the support of only a tiny minority .
Such support must be on the basis of giving workers the confidence to openly come out and demonstrate , strike , etc .
It is a tactic towards such mobilisations not an end in itself .
Problems exist with this , commonly the individual elected may take up her / his seat despite pre-election promises of abstention if elected .
Even in the hunger strike case where those on hunger strikes could not take up their seats the danger of such tactics is obvious .
The vote was seen by Sinn Fein as proof that a turn towards electoral politics was the correct direction for anti-imperialism to take .
The potential of a mass campaign at the time of the hunger strikes based on strikes North and South of the border was thus lost .
The decision to support a single issue candidate would have to involve hard arguments on the subsequent direction of the campaign and could not be taken lightly .
Another instance where anarchists would not urge a abstention from the bosses electoral process is in the case of referendums .
The WSM was involved ( and indeed still is ) in the Divorce Action Group .
Despite the severe limitations of the 1986 referendum we still canvassed for a YES vote .
In the 1983 anti-abortion referendum anarchists advocated a NO vote .
Of course we do n't accept the conclusions of either referendum as final .
We still fight for the right to divorce and a woman 's right to control her fertility up to and including free , safe abortion on demand .
Such things are democratic rights in themselves , something no majority should have a veto over .
What do we say to people in the reformist parties ?
They can not ( and should not ) be ignored .
We say look at the record of your party in government or to the Workers Party when you supported the 1981 minority Fianna Fail government .
Look at what your party stands for .
Look at the record of your party in the trade union bureaucracy .
Look at the historical role reformist parties have played in other countries .
Reformism has had it 's test and failed one hundred times .
Leave it , find out more about anarchism and join the fight for working class self - emancipation .

On 15 October 2017 , a business jet on base leg for an easterly ILS approach at St Gallen - Altenrhein came into close proximity with a reciprocal track glider at 5000 feet QNH in Class ‘ E’ airspace in day VMC with neither aircraft seeing the other until just before their minimum separation - 0.35 nm horizontally and 131 feet vertically - occurred .
The Investigation attributed the conflict to the lack of relevant traffic separation requirements in Class E airspace and to the glider not having its transponder switched on and not listening out with the relevant ATC Unit .

Dear Pat ,
I 'm in a weird situation .
Normally I pride myself in minding my own business .
I keep my nose out of my friends affairs ( literally ) and generally keep my opinions to myself .
But recently I ended up doing some research into circumcision .
Not female circumcision , which everyone in their right mind generally admits it barbaric and creepy , but good old fashioned guy circumcision .
The type that 's done to almost all newborn boys here in the good old U S of A .
I found out not only is it totally unnecessary , but it 's generally bad for the little kids .
Despite the fact that it 's the standard thing here in the US , where almost 90 % of guys are circumcised .
My problem is , I have a friend who is about to give birth .
Maybe to a little boy .
Now that I know all the horrible things that can result from Circumcision , I feel like I should try to tell her about it so she wo n't do it .
But is n't this kinda sticking my nose in where it does n't belong ?
I can't think of a good way to approach her .
I mean , I do n't have a penis myself , so I can't really speak from experience .
I have been with guys both cut and uncut , and I was surprised to find out how much I liked the unedited penis .
But again , I doubt that 's the right way to approach things with my friend .
How can I mention this to her without offending her for getting in her business ?
Student Not Into Penis Slicing .

Any of you who have been to my book signings know I tend to move back and forth between reading my stuff and doing Q&A.
I do this partly to break up the potential monotony of an hour of straight reading , and partly because I really like to answer questions .
Any sort of question , really .
That 's part of the reason I became a teacher , I think .
And it probably factored into my decision to keep writing my College Survival Guide for about 10 years .
I even , believe it or not , wrote a sex advice column for a while .
Under an assumed name .
When I do Q&A at a reading , there are some things that get asked a lot .
Things like , " Where do you get your ideas ? " or " Do you base your characters on real people ?
" Then there are the questions that do n't get asked very often .
Like , " Do you like cats ? " or " How do you feel about circumcision ?
" This last question got asked when I was down in Lexington .
Strangely , was n't the first time I 'd been asked .
I actually wrote an column on it back when I was doing the Survival Guide .
As luck would have it , I had a copy of that column with me .
So I read it .
After the reading when I was signing books , someone said , " You should post that one up on line . "
" I probably should , " I said .
So here it is ... Your College Survival Guide , the place to go when you really need to learn the finer points of dick discussion etiquette .
I 'm like Miss Manners with tourettes .
Alright , SNIPS , I 'm going to glide right by a few too - obvious jokes about your nose , and get right to the business of answering your question .
Back when I was younger I would have taken this as a golden opportunity to make a lot of wang jokes .
But I 've matured since then .
So , instead , I 'm going to slide as many innuendo - laden puns into the column as humanly possible .
Also , just to make it a challenge , I 'm going to use a new euphemism for the male member each time I refer to it .
First I feel like I need to correct one of the statements you made in your letter .
Uncircumcised fellas are more common than you make them out to be .
Back in the 1960's about 90 percent of baby boys got the chop , but the circumcision rate these days is closer to 60 % , as more and more people get clued in to the situation by helpful folks like you and me .
Secondly , the proper slang term for an gent 's uncircumcised dangle - bob is n't " unedited , " it 's " director 's cut . "
Occasionally it 's even a " special edition director 's cut , " but that 's very rare .
Hmmm .
You 're right though .
This is a touchy subject .
But there 's a big difference between being pushy , and just giving your friend some valuable information .
Still , it should be handled delicately .
Here are some opening lines you might want to avoid : " Jenny , lately I 've been thinking a lot about your baby 's penis . "
" Have you ever thought that hacking a chunk off the end of your newborn 's wing - wang might not be the best way to welcome him into the world ? " " Y'know , if I was going to have sex with your son , I 'd prefer him to be uncircumcised .
"
The more I think about it , maybe you do n't want to try to get a rise out of her .
Instead maybe you could just try to bring it up casually instead .
Maybe quoting a few facts would be the way to go .
Do n't be accusatory , just point out why , exactly , chopping someone 's fireman off is n't cool .
Point out that since the foreskin actually has about a third of the penis ' nerve endings on it , cutting it off it pretty much the same as a partial clitorectomy .
In plainer terms , it 's like cutting off a good chunk of a little girl 's clit .
As you said in your letter : barbaric and creepy .
Think of it guys .
You know how you think your Johnson is pretty awesome now ?
Imagine if it was 33 % more awesome .
Yeah .
I know .
It boggles the mind .
I expect some manner of radiant light would constantly be emanating from my pants .
Most of us would never leave the house .
The fact that a piece of my winkie was torn off without my approval leaves me feeling a little bent out of shape .
Figuratively speaking .
You could also direct your friend to a good website or two , so she can gather her own facts .
www.notjustskin.org has a remarkably well - researched and easy to read FAQ on the subject .
Including some information about how the surgery might be seriously traumatic for the newborns involved .
In closing , for all my fellow fellows out there , if your parents gave your special purpose the snip , do n't hold it against them .
Because , y'know , that would be pretty weird .
It 's interesting to note that I wrote this a couple years before I became a dad .
It was nice , actually , having done this research ahead of time .
Because I knew from the beginning that I did n't want to circumcise the baby if it was a boy .
But even if I had n't done the research , I probably would have been convinced when I saw The Circumstraint :
That 's really what it 's called .
It 's the plastic thing they strap your baby down onto so he does n't struggle around too much while they 're trying to cut off a piece of his dick .
The nurses thought I was kinda weird for wanting to take a picture of it .
While part of me , the scientific part , can acknowledge the fact that something like this helps keep the baby safe during the procedure .
The rest of me is filled with a mute horror at the thought of someone tying my baby down onto this thing so they can cut him .
Not because he * needs * it .
Just , y'know , because .
Tradition .
And stuff .
A lot of times when people meet Oot , they say things like , " He 's such a happy baby . "
Or " He 's so friendly and trusting .
" Sometimes I want to reply , " Well , we got things off on the right foot by not cutting off a piece of his dick .
" Can you imagine what sort of an introduction that must be to the world ?
There 's a big , long squeeze , then suddenly everything is really bright and cold .
Maybe you get a bit of a cuddle and a taste of breast .
Then you 're strapped down and someone cuts off a piece off one of the most sensitive areas of your body .
Welcome to being alive , little guy .
That 's all for now , folks.
pat

You call me a terrorist but I ’ve never killed anyone in my life .
You send troops to Iraq and Afghanistan to kill innocent people .
This is what Wissam Mahmoud Fatall yelled in a Melbourne court recently about ‘ terrorism ’ charges bought against him .
He ’s right .
One million Iraqis have died as a consequence of the US led invasion .
The figures for Afghanistan are unknown but rank in the tens in not hundreds of thousands .
The Russian invasion and ten year long occupation ( with up to 100,000 troops at a time ) killed over one million Afghans and forced 5 million out of the country into Pakistan and Iran .
Another 2 million were internally displaced .
NATO troops in Afghanistan at the moment total less than half the Russian number ( although the US is increasing the number ) but have been there for over eight years .
Taking into account the fact the resistance does n’t have the same firepower as the US backed mujahideen in the days of the Russian occupation , it seems reasonable to conclude that the number of civilians we have killed is approaching 100,000 .
Some conservative estimates put it at 30,000 .
Certainly the Australian Defence Force has admitted Australian soldier have killed innocent civilians .
But of course as long as we are following the ‘ rules of engagement ’ that is OK .
And now we pay blood money to cover up our crimes and salve our consciences .
How much is an afghan kids ’ life worth , Mr Rudd ?
The left must be clear on this .
A victory for the resistance in Afghanistan would be a step forward for humanity because it would be a defeat for US imperialism .
Our task must be to build a mass movement in Australia against this imperialist war and to force our Governments to withdraw our troops .
The defeat of Russian imperialism in Afghanistan was one of the important steps that led to the liberation of Russia and Eastern Europe from stalinism .
The defeat of US imperialism in Vietnam meant that the beast licked its wounds for ten years before invading a defenceless island called Grenada in a dry run for bigger battles .
The victory of the resistance in Afghanistan will force the US killing machine to retreat for a while from its global war of terror .
This is a good thing .
Less people around the world will die or have their lives ruined as a consequence .
More people will feel confident to resist US rule .
Those arrested in Melbourne supposedly have Somali connections .
Somalia is a basket case because of US imperialism .
In 2006 the US used Ethiopia as its attack dog to overthrow the Islamic Government in Somalia , a government establishing peace across the country after 15 years of anarchy .
Now the US supports a puppet regime around one of the men it overthrew .
He has become imperialism ’s puppet against the Islamist forces , forces which have major support in many areas of the country .
As the destruction of Somalia and the resistance it has provoked show , imperialism is the real machine of terror around the world .
With Somali men on trial in Melbourne , the media has run and will run wild stories and analysis about terrorists .
These servants of capital ignore the real story .
When Barack Obama and Kevin Rudd and their predecessors George Bush and John Howard sit in the dock in The Hague charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity then we can say there is justice in the world .
Until that day there is no justice .
The real terrorists sit in Canberra and Washington .
Mars has been nothing but bad luck for the Russians .
They have launched 20 probes to the planet since 1960 , and all either failed or suffered from severe technical problems .
But soon — as early as this October — Russia will attempt to reverse its fortunes with one of the most ambitious unmanned space missions ever .
Instead of aiming straight for Mars , the Russians are going after Phobos , the larger of its two little satellites and one of the oddest objects around .
Their probe , called Fobos - Grunt ( “ Phobos soil ” in Russian ) , will not only land on Phobos but also scoop up some samples of the surface and send them to Earth .
Understanding Phobos could tell us a lot about the early history of the solar system .
“ It may give us clues to the formation of Earth ’s moon and the moons of the other planets , and the role played by asteroid impacts in shaping the terrestrial [ rocky ] planets , ” says Alexander Zakharov of the Moscow - based Space Research Institute and chief scientist for Fobos - Grunt .
Even more important , this mission could lay the groundwork for an innovative strategy for exploring — and even colonizing — Mars itself .
Phobos is very different from our moon .
It is a potato - shaped rock measuring only 12 miles by 17 miles , nearly as dark as coal , and dominated by a six - mile - wide crater called Stickney , evidence of a collision that nearly shattered the puny satellite .
Phobos circles just 3,721 miles above the Martian surface ( Earth ’s moon averages a distance of 239,000 miles ) and completes an orbit in 7 hours and 39 minutes , making a Phobos “ month ” on Mars less than one - third of a Martian day .
In fact , Phobos circles so close to Mars that tidal forces are slowly causing its orbit to decay .
Within the next few tens of millions of years it will crash into the planet ; we are catching it at the tail end of its 4.5 - billion - year life .
The same proximity to Mars that will one day doom Phobos makes it an extremely attractive staging post for human explorers .
One side of Phobos always faces Mars , and on that “ hemisphere ” the planet dominates the sky .
This makes Phobos a good place for monitoring most of the Martian surface .
Moreover , any manned outpost on Phobos would be well shielded from space radiation — protected on one side by Mars and on the other by the satellite ’s own bulk .
From Phobos humans could explore the planet ’s surface remotely using robots , eliminating the agonizing 10 - to 20 - minute delay that the operators of NASA ’s Mars rovers currently have to endure .
Phobos would also be a natural staging area for manned excursions to Mars .
Hebes Chasma , a Martian valley where water once flowed , could be studied in detail from Phobos .
Phobos 's soil may also contain debris blasted off Mars by ancient impacts .
| ESA / DLR / FU Berlin ( G. Neukum )
Before we start drawing up plans for outposts on Phobos , though , we need a much better grasp of what kind of place it is .
Right now scientists do not even know exactly what Phobos is made of .
It appears similar to a group of asteroids known as carbonaceous chondrites .
These primitive objects contain amino acids , the building blocks of life , and appear to be nearly unchanged fragments of the material from which the solar system formed .
Scientists have speculated that a rain of carbonaceous chondrites may have seeded early Earth with the raw material for biology here .
Phobos ’s distinctive composition has led some scientists to suspect that it ( along with Deimos , Mars ’s other miniature satellite ) might be a captured asteroid .
But that is far from a foregone conclusion .
The surface of Phobos ( left ) is very different form that of the smaller Martian moon Deimos .
Scientists do not yet know why .
| NASA / JPL - Cal Tech / University of Arizona
“ Phobos is a funny object , ” says David Beatty , chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Directorate .
“ It ’s kind of a mystery why Phobos is there and where it came from . ” RKA , the Russian space agency , hopes to get some answers by having Fobos - Grunt gather samples of Phobos ’s battered surface .
Back on Earth , detailed analysis will identify their precise composition and age .
( A suite of onboard instruments will also do some analysis on Phobos . )
From this we should get new insights into the history of Phobos and a broader snapshot of what our solar system was like in its formative days .
In this mission , Fobos - Grunt will get a huge assist from the laws of orbital mechanics .
Owing to the counterintuitive rules of space navigation , it takes remarkably little energy to get to Phobos from Earth .
In fact , the energy required to travel between two spots in the solar system has virtually nothing to do with the distance between them .
What really matters is a quantity called delta-v , the amount that a spaceship ’s velocity must change to shift from one trajectory to another .
Delta -v depends on how strong the gravitational fields are at your departure and arrival points ; how much energy you need to swing farther out from ( or in toward ) the sun ; and how much assistance you can get from atmospheric braking — that is , skimming through a planet ’s atmosphere to help slow down .
The total delta-v required for a mission to land on Phobos and come back is startlingly low — only about 80 percent that of a round trip to the surface of Earth ’s moon .
( That is in part because of Phobos ’s feeble gravity ; a well - aimed pitch could launch a softball off its surface . )
It is actually easier to send a probe or cargo to Phobos than to the moon .
The comparison for a manned flight is more complicated , since a crew would need much more food and air for the six - month journey to Phobos than for the three - day trip to our moon .
But the huge additional delta-v needed to get down to the Mars surface and back up into orbit again means it would be vastly cheaper and easier to maintain an outpost on Phobos than on the Martian surface .
If the mission is successful , Fobos - Grunt will be the first probe to explore the Earth - Phobos - Earth space highway .
The one - ton probe will enter orbit around Mars in August or September 2010 ( assuming Russia ’s schedule does not slip ) and begin studying Phobos remotely .
Once the mission scientists have selected a good landing spot , the spacecraft will touch down on the satellite ’s surface sometime in March or April 2011 .
Then Fobos - Grunt will extend a robot arm and start collecting samples of regolith — surface soil and rocks — for return to Earth .
The main body of the probe will serve as a launchpad for the small return module and remain permanently on Phobos .
When the 233 - pound return module reaches Earth in June or July 2012 , it will drop off a soccer - ball - size capsule containing a thumb - size canister of precious Phobos soil ; finally , the canister will make a hard landing in a remote region of Kazakhstan .
Planetary scientists hope that analysis of Phobos ’s regolith will shed light on the nature of the satellite ’s deep interior because of the turnover between the surface and the interior over the eons .
Phobos ’s density is very low , about two - thirds that of ordinary basalt .
This could mean that it is similar to water - rich objects in the outer edge of the asteroid belt , or it could mean that Phobos is a rubble pile , with many empty cavities between rock fragments .
“ The single most important issue to address on Phobos regarding the future human exploration of Mars is the question of water , ” says Pascal Lee , chairman of the Mars Institute , a research organization .
“ Does Phobos contain any water , and if so , in what amount , form , and location ?
Answers to these questions will help determine how we will travel to Mars . ”
Phobos ’s exterior poses some riddles of its own .
Its most striking visual structures ( aside from the giant Stickney crater ) are sets of crater chains that line up across the surface .
Deimos does not have anything like them , nor do any of the half - dozen regular asteroids imaged by space probes so far .
One theory is that the craters are old steam vents , relics of an ancient catastrophe that cracked Phobos ’s crust and heated its interior , sending steam blasting outward .
This would be good news for future human visits to Mars , as vents would mark the location of water - bearing minerals , perhaps even buried deposits of water ice .
Another , less enticing possibility is that the holes are crevices opened by tidal forces or by impacts that caused the entire moon to flex .
A third theory holds that the crater chains are tied to ancient impacts on Mars .
Some meteor strikes in Mars ’s past were powerful enough to propel pieces of the planet ’s crust at speeds greater than escape velocity , some 3.1 miles per second .
We know this because scientists have found meteorites on Earth that clearly originated on Mars ; these pieces evidently drifted around the solar system before landing here .
If some fragments of the Martian surface reached Earth , many more of them should have hit Phobos on the way out .
The swarms of rocks sent flying by a major impact on Mars might have created the crater chains seen on Phobos .
In fact , by some estimates , up to 10 percent of the satellite ’s surface might consist of material that originated on Mars .
Seen in this light , Russia ’s Fobos - Grunt strategy looks rather clever .
Despite its low profile , Phobos may turn out to be one of the most intriguing places in the solar system .
And , located in a sweet spot of accessibility , it is a natural outpost for future space exploration , whether with people or with probes .
If there is a key stepping - stone from Earth to Mars , this odd , intriguing space rock could be it .
Over the weekend , the White House floated the idea of constructing ( or renovating ) a vast court - and - prison complex in either Kansas or Michigan .
The facility would be used to detain and prosecute terrorism suspects now being held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The leak followed published reports last week that the Justice Department is evaluating anew dozens of cases of Gitmo detainees to see if any more of the men should be prosecuted in American courtrooms under federal criminal law .
Both of these developments are perfectly logical , refreshingly practical and entirely consistent with the Obama administration ’s promise to close Gitmo by the end of the year .
For years , remember , the closure of the base has been a bipartisan goal , opposed only by the worst ideologues in both parties .
But now that we ’re actually facing the tough moral and political choices necessary to closing Guantanamo , politicians are running for cover .
Take Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - Kan . ) .
The senior senator from the Sunflower State was cheering along with all the rest of us when President George W. Bush told us in late 2001 that we ’d need to sacrifice in the name of winning the war on terror .
Now , however , Brownback has gone into full Chicken Little mode , warning anyone who will listen that Gitmo should not be emptied and closed after all because it ’s too dangerous to have prisoners at Ft. Leavenworth .
“ We do n’t want them here , ” he said on Monday .
“ They should be treated with dignity and humanely , but it should n’t it be here . ”
This is the terror - law equivalent of a “ not in my backyard ” mentality that has thwarted the resolution of thorny issues in America for centuries .
Except that the problem of what to do with the detainees is not like the problem of what to do with the nuclear waste bound for Yucca Mountain .
The prisoners are men , mortals , and they wo n’t be around for a half - life .
They are n’t even the “ worst of the worst , ” a grossly unfair label that men such as former Attys .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales and John Ashcroft placed on them despite strong evidence to the contrary .

A great many terrorists have been successfully prosecuted and sentenced under federal criminal law -- both before and after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The roster of current maximum - security federal inmates reads like a Who ’s Who of Terrorism : Zacarias Moussaoui , Richard Reid , Jose Padilla , Ramzi Yousef , Ahmed Ressam ( not to mention home - grown lovelies such as Terry Nichols and Ted Kaczynski , the Unabomber ) .
If Gitmo detainees are transferred to Kansas , it will not become a battlefield for terrorists any more than Colorado has become a scene of carnage in the years since terror - convicts have been sent to the federal “ supermax ” facility there .
The prisoners incarcerated in Kansas , before or after trial , would be part of a system that is as safe as the world has ever known .
I have toured the supermax facility , and I defy anyone who also has done so to suggest that it , or a new , similar prison , could not safely house the prisoners until they die , are transferred elsewhere or are released .
Brownback ’s got the scare tactics down , but what tangible proof does he have that bringing detainees to Kansas ( or anywhere else in America , for that matter ) will make Americans less safe ?
More pointedly , why does he think that keeping Gitmo a working prison for terror suspects is a better alternative than trying to disperse them in groups to the States for processing ?
We are n’t talking about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed or Ramzi Binalshibh , remember , we are talking mostly about men who are used to being led , not to leading or planning .
It ’s time for Brownback to become a statesman in the old - fashioned sense of that word , putting aside parochialism for the sake of the country .
The senator should n’t be worrying his constituents that the sky will fall on them if more prisoners come there -- there already are more dangerous men in prison in Kansas than exist at Gitmo .
Instead , he should be using his considerable rhetorical skills to sell his fellow Kansans on the idea that if the men are to be placed somewhere , it ought to be right there in the heartland , with its long tradition of housing dangerous prisoners safely and securely .

Like the Bush administration before it , the Obama White House is doggedly trying to fix the mess caused by Guantanamo ’s status as an international symbol of American excess .
The White House and the departments of Defense and Justice should push these measures through , and lawmakers who oppose them should get out of the way .
Tony Blair is a contender to become the first president of the EU with the full backing of the British government , the new Europe minister said today .
Glenys Kinnock , in Strasbourg for the opening session of the new European parliament , said that although the former prime minister had not formally declared his candidacy , it was " certainly " the government position to support him .
" I am sure they would not do it without asking him , " Lady Kinnock said .
" The UK government is supporting Tony Blair 's candidature for president of the council . "
The new post is to be created under the Lisbon treaty , which will streamline the way the EU is run if it is endorsed in an Irish referendum in early October .
Blair would be the first sitting president of the EU , who will be appointed by European government chiefs for a minimum of 30 months and a maximum of five years .
If the Irish back the treaty on 2 October , EU leaders are expected to decide on who will get the presidency at a summit at the end of that month .
" Blair is seen by many as someone who has the strength of character , the stature , " Kinnock said .
" People know who he is , and he would be someone who would have this role and step into it with a lot of respect and I think would be generally welcomed . "
While Blair has declined to declare himself as a candidate before the outcome of the Irish referendum , Kinnock 's remarks were the first solid confirmation that he is to run for the job .
However , British diplomats said her comments remained speculation for the moment because the Irish could yet vote down the treaty – as they did in their first referendum last year .
" The reality is Lisbon has not entered into force , " one diplomat said .
" Blair has yet to say whether he will stand . "
A spokesman for the ex-PM said : " The job does n't exist , so there is nothing to be a candidate for . "
If he stands for the post , the founder of New Labour could yet in to stiff opposition in Europe .
Fredrik Reinfeldt , the Swedish prime minister – who took over the rotating presidency of the EU this month and will chair the October summit – is known to be strongly opposed to a Blair presidency .
Reinfeldt told the Guardian he would not get into any discussion about names for the post , while a senior European diplomat said the presidency would be " the absolute top subject " at the October summit .
Reinfeldt said he expected to oversee the launch of the Lisbon treaty , " including the elected council chairman [ Europe president ] " .
He added that if the treaty was ratified by all member states , he expected " very many names " to be put forward for the presidency .
José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , the Spanish prime minister , who will succeed to the EU presidency after Reinfeldt in January , is also an opponent of Blair .
France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , an early fan of the idea of President Blair , appears now to have turned lukewarm .
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said the creation of a new EU president " could be enormously damaging for Europe " .
" Any holder is likely to try to centralise power for themselves in Brussels and dominate national foreign policies , " he said .
" In the hands of an operator as ambitious as Tony Blair , that is a near certainty .
He should be let nowhere near the job .
" It shows what a grip Lord Mandelson now has over Gordon Brown that he has been forced to support his bitterest rival . "
In an interview today on ABC ’s “ This Week With George Stephanopoulus , ” Vice President Joe Biden said it was up to the Israeli government to decide if Iran constituted an existential threat and that the nation was “ entitled ” to launch a military strike against the nation if they wanted to .
Biden said the United States would make no effort to dissuade the Israeli government from launching an attack on Iran , but was deliberately evasive on the question of whether the US would provide Israel with access to Iraqi airspace for the strike , saying he did n’t want to “ speculate . ”
Israel has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran over the past several years , and the right - wing coalition government elected earlier this year won largely on a platform of taking an even more hawkish position toward Iran than previous administraitons had .
At issue is Iran ’s civilian nuclear program , which despite a lack of evidence Israel claims is being used to construct a nuclear weapon in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Israel is itself not a signatory of the NPT , and has a large , undeclared nuclear arsenal .
US defense officials , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , have warned that a military attack on Iran , whether by the US or Israel , would be blamed on the US and would create a “ disastrous backlash . ”
When someone linked me to Ravi Vakil ’s advice for potential graduate students , I was struck by the following passage :
… [ M ] athematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically , and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next , you ’ll never get anywhere .
Instead , you ’ll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone [ emphasis mine ] .
Then you can later backfill from these tendrils , and extend your comfort zone ; this is much easier to do than learning “ forwards ” .
( Caution : this backfilling is necessary .
There can be a temptation to learn lots of fancy words and to use them in fancy sentences without being able to say precisely what you mean .
You should feel free to do that , but you should always feel a pang of guilt when you do . )
It ’s great to hear this coming from an expert because this is exactly what I ’ve been doing for the past year without realizing it .
Without formally learning anything , I ’ve begun extending tendrils into algebraic topology , category theory , and all sorts of subjects about which I still ca n’t say anything particularly intelligent .
However , from my experience so far I have a tentative list of the benefits of this strategy :
It becomes easier to recognize related concepts or constructions across different subjects , hence to tie them together .
If you have a concept you do n’t fully understand sitting in the back of your head , it may come to pass that once you learn the necessary tools to understand it you may re-derive the concept partially based on your memory .
As Richard Feynman said , “ what I cannot create , I do not understand . ”
Certain things become better motivated if you can say to yourself something like , “ oh , I know why we ’re learning about Theorem X ; it ’s an instance of Phenomenon Y which has lots of other nontrivial instances . ”
Here I ’ll give an example : Pontryagin duality .
You are naturally led to ask lots of questions , and questions are great .
“ This looks a lot like Theory Z , ” you might ask your professor .
“ What ’s the connection ? ”
The idea that constantly working outside your comfort zone is key to progress appears to me to be a general phenomenon ; in two - player games and sports , for example , playing opponents who are better than you is a great way to improve .
What I ’m curious about , though , is whether the undergraduate math curriculum explicitly encourages “ tendril ” behavior .
Perhaps it ’s just something every math major should be motivated to do independently , but I ca n’t help but think that Ravi ’s advice , which I ’ve never seen written down anywhere else , should be more widely acknowledged .
House Panel Votes to Let States Adopt Single - Payer Health Coverage
Created : July 17 , 2009 14:35 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Federally sponsored single - payer health care might be off the table as Congress debates its health reform strategy this summer , but if some House lawmakers get their way , there would be nothing to prevent states from offering that model .
The House Education & Labor Committee voted today in favor of an amendment , sponsored by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) , eliminating legal barriers that might prevent states from adopting a Medicare - style system of health coverage .
The vote was 25 to 19 , with support coming from an odd mix of liberal Democrats who support single - payer on its merits and conservative Republicans who want to preserve the rights of states to regulate themselves .
The vote is largely symbolic .
Cash - strapped states likely wo n’t be able to rustle up the funding to cover all their residents without federal help , even if they did support the concept politically .
Still , some health care groups are cheering the House vote nonetheless .
The California Nurses Association , for example , issued a statement calling the vote “ a historic moment for patients . ”
If the provision were to become law , CNA argues , single - payer supporters could move their lobbying battle from Washington to state capitals .
Kucinich offered his own take on the significance of the push .
“ By getting rid of the for - profit insurance companies , ” the Ohio liberal said in a statement , “ we can save $ 400 billion per year and provide coverage for all medically necessary services for everyone in the U.S. ”
Ronnie James
Dio recently spoke out in regards to the frequent over use of the " devils horns " sign that he claims to have invented .
While I wish not to get into a debate on whether or not he did in fact invent the sign I think , Ronnie has bought up a very important point .
With the younger generation flashing it around every chance they get , its seems to be diminishing the impact of the metal hand gesture .
" It was a symbol of darkness not something to be passed on to BRITNEY SPEARS ! " stated Ronnie .
Dio also expressed concern that incorrect technique also appears to be propagating .
" You 'll notice that a lot of people are using the thumb now " he noted , " When the thumb comes out , it means ' I love you ' in either Hawaiian or sign language  I 'm not sure which . "
Back in the old days the metal sign was a very sacred symbol which was used only for special occasion but with the vagrant overuse Ronnie feels it is losing it 's impact .
If you have been to see a Dio gig you will have noticed that he will wait until 2 - 3 songs before he breaks out the symbol , waiting for the most opportune moment where it would get maximum effect " There has to be some emotion behind it It might sound stupid but I never once did that on stage unless it was to punctuate something that was a little more dark . "
Ronnie is obviously a master of the technique and I feel the younger generation should take heed of his message and consider the usage of the devils horns a bit more seriously .

A few thoughts on ‘ anarchist warfare ’ and ‘ statist warfare ’ .
In normal wars ( though to varying degrees ) , the contest is between two or more territory - controlling forces .
The activity of ‘ controlling ’ territory is distinct from the activity of living there ; the contending forces are thus distinct from the populations inhabiting the areas fought over ( again , to varying degrees ) .
Consequently , the inhabiting population tends to appear as a passive ‘ background ’ , as what is ‘ fought over ’ .
As long as this pattern is in place , I would call the conflict ‘ statist ’ regardless of whether it ’s one ‘ official ’ state against another , one ‘ rebel ’ group against another , an established government against rebels , etc .
The point is , insofar as the dynamic of the war divides the population in general from the contending forces , and makes one passive and the other active , the essential dynamics of statehood are in play .
So what would an anarchist war look like ?
The ideal ( however closely it is or is n’t acheived ) is that this division between warring force and local population not exist .
That is , the ideal would be that the activity of ‘ controlling ’ territory be simply an aspect of living there ; that local populations at each point be actively organised to maintain something like a ‘ monopoly of violence ’ in that area .
That is , to have participatory dispute - resolution mechanisms , participatory measures for combatting small - scale violence , and participatory measures for combatting large - scale violence , along with democratic structures for planning and co-ordinating their activities at every scale .
One consequence would be that rather than fighting being either ‘ defensive ’ ( seeking to maintain control over an area already controlled ) or ‘ offensive ’ ( seeking to gain control over an area not already controlled ) , it would be either ‘ defensive ’ or ‘ catalytic ’ – seeking to encourage the population of an area controlled by an enemy force to depose them , institute anarchic rule , and ( hopefully ) make peace .
A further consequence is that since ‘ offensive ’ fighting becomes impossible , ‘ indiscriminate ’ methods become impractical , as well as immoral .
If your goal is to encourage the organised self - assertion of a local population , and to hope for their support , it would make no sense at all to set off bombs in that area that would separate children ’s feet from their legs or leave random people homeless .
In a way , such anarchistic war would be both a struggle against the enemy and a struggle against war itself – in that circumstances of mistrust , fear , danger , grief , and unpredictable disaster are all liable , in general , to undermine the sorts of habits that make communal organised self - assertion easier ( e.g. trust , willingness to make sacrifices without an guarantee of immediate compensation , etc ) .
This is both a weakness and a strength – we would expect any good way to wage war to be like this , because war is a disastrous thing .
Of course , it might be objected – what if a population , while running itself in a wholly participatory , anarchistic ( Communist ! Genderless ! Vegan ! ) manner , still seeks to assault , dominate , invade or bomb neighbouring areas ?
It ’s true that nothing I ’ve said so far tells us what to do in such a situation .
I do n’t think we should expect it to : such a situation is a ‘ tragic ’ one , in that no response is really a good one .
Ethical principles break down , and contradict each other .
All that can be said is that based on the specifics of the situation , people would have to decide what response produced the best results .
But I would n’t be an anarchist if I did n’t think that such an eventuality was unlikely – if I did n’t think that people who had the fullest and most substantial freedom would be immunised against the petty hatreds and emotional ignorance that leads to support for war , besides being freed from the structures that give some people an abiding interest in sending people to war .
Child Porn Charges Laid 2 Yrs. After Man Allegedly Makes Contact With 13 - Yr. - Old Girl :
Man charged with sexual assault , making child pornography and bestiality :
Police fear other victims after kid-porn arrest :
28 - year - old Derek Campbell is accused of using the goth social networking site Vampirefreaks to lure a then 13 - year - old girl in 2007 .
The girl just recently reported the crime to police .
Now before Goat Boy ’s friends start jumping all over the girl for waiting two years before reporting the crime , save it .
I ’m sure she felt threatened and possibly too embarrassed to report it .
Anyway , Goat Boy allegedly lured the 13 - year - old girl into meeting him and then used the girl not only to make child porn but also bestiality porn .
Police in Toronto are afraid that he may have even more victims .
They believe there may be other victims and want anyone who may have had contact with Campbell to call ( 416 ) 808-7467 or anonymously to Crime Stoppers at ( 416 ) 222-TIPS . ( 8477 ) .
No word if the bestiality charge comes from if he forced her to have sex with him .
Seriously , he looks like a goat .
Phoenix stripper Samantha Abernathy ( pictured ) was arrested yesterday after cops discovered she 'd left her two little kids , 1 and 3 years old , alone in the house for hours .
Neighbors called the cops at about 7:30 a.m. because the kids were running around loose in the apartment complex .
Abernathy had left them alone since about two or three in the morning .
When the kids were let back in their apartment , the 1 - year - old immediately went to the pantry and began eating dog food .
Guess he 'd done that before .
The fridge had almost nothing in it but booze .
By the way , Abernathy does n't turn 21 until later this month .
This is our favorite line from East Valley Tribune reporter Gary Grado 's article this morning : Police say the fathers of the children arrived at 10 a.m.
Sunday , but they did n't know who was supposed to be watching the children or where Abernathy was .
What a cluster f .
These dads ought to read up on the case of Haley Gray and take appropriate action now , before it 's too late .
UPDATE : Cops changed the story on Tuesday after New Times called for clarification .
Now , police say neither of the kids was actually seen eating dog food .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - A growing team of Fiat SpA executives and engineers has been working at Chrysler ’s Detroit - area headquarters this week , finalizing plans to cut costs and ready the Fiat 500 small car for the U.S. market , people with knowledge of the work said .
Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne , who is expected to take over operational control at Chrysler , has been leading the team from the Italian automaker , according to the sources who asked not to be named because a deal to merge the two companies under Marchionne has not been cleared by U.S. courts .
A Chrysler spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment .
Fiat had no comment .
A federal appeals court will hear arguments from three Indiana state pension funds looking to block the sale of most of Chrysler ’s assets to a group led by Fiat on Friday .
Chrysler has been operating in bankruptcy with the backing and financing of the U.S. Treasury since April 30 .
The plan brokered by the White House - appointed autos task force is for the United Autos Workers union to take 55 percent of a reorganized Chrysler in a deal that has been on track to close this month .
The U.S. government and Canadian government would hold a combined 10 percent stake .
Fiat would obtain 20 percent of Chrysler in exchange for bringing its small - car technology and management to the U.S. automaker .
Fiat ’s stake would rise to 35 percent over time as it meets benchmarks in the company ’s turnaround .
But in advance of the closing of the Chrysler deal , Marchionne has been leading an effort involving several dozen executives from Italy intended to drive cost savings on parts purchasing and to smooth the way for the introduction of the Fiat 500 to the U.S. market .
Smaller than a Mini , the 500 is expected to get more than 40 miles per gallon ( 17 km per liter ) as measured by U.S. regulatory standards .
Named Europe ’s car of the year for 2008 , the 500 was the centerpiece of Fiat ’s pitch to U.S. officials that it could help reinvent Chrysler and move it away from its reliance on heavier trucks and minivans .
Plans are for the 500 to be brought over to Chrysler ’s U.S. dealers 18 months after the work on readying it to meet U.S. safety standards began , the people with knowledge of the effort said .
That aggressive timetable is intended to bring the 500 to U.S. showrooms by the end of 2010 .
The plan is for the 500 to be the first new product introduced by Chrysler under the still - pending deal with Fiat , the sources said .
In April , before Fiat had sealed a deal to take its controlling stake in Chrysler , Jim Press , Chrysler ’s vice chairman , was promoting the 500 by driving one onstage for his appearance at a news conference for the New York auto show .
Press , speaking to reporters on Wednesday in Washington , said work had already begun to produce a range of new vehicles based on Fiat vehicle architectures and powertrains .
A separate team of Fiat engineers has been working with Chrysler to examine plans for vehicles still in development part by part to see where the two companies can begin to share components to bring down costs , sources said .
One potential complication of that effort is the deep drop in Chrysler sales this year .
Chrysler ’s 2008 sales were near 2 million vehicles , which , combined with Fiat ’s 2.2 million vehicle sales , would have created a combined automaker with global sales near Hyundai Motor Co , projections prepared by Fiat showed .
But Chrysler ’s sales in the United States have plunged by 46 percent through the first five months of the year .
That is a problem because the U.S. automaker has relied on the U.S. market for almost 90 percent of its overall sales .
Auto suppliers have been hurt by the sharp decline in industry production volume .
In a further blow , Chrysler opted to shut down all of its factories during its bankruptcy .
Restructuring advisers and analysts have said many of the smaller and privately held suppliers could face a cash crunch as auto production picks up and they are asked to bring workers back and restart plants .
“ Our production for our company will start by the end of June .
For all of our parts , ” Chrysler ’s Press said on Wednesday .
oh god I do n't even know

What it is like to live in the Playboy Mansion as one of Hugh Hefner 's many girlfriends ?
Izabella whatsit - presumably not her real name , given that she is Polish - was 26 and still at law school when she was picked up by Hugh Hefner in an LA bar .
Well , not by him - that 's not his style - but by one of the " party posse " of platinum blondes who accompany him everywhere .
Soon Izabella was being asked to Fun in the Sun Sundays at the Playboy Mansion and in January 2002 she was invited to move into the Mansion and become an official Hefner Girlfriend , one of seven at the time .
She had all the right qualities - long platinum hair , doe eyes , big breasts and a limitless capacity to coo over animals and soft toys .
She was also , judging from this book , not stupid - she says that she was " the token brain " of the harem and I 'm inclined to believe her .
Hugh Hefner with his , then , six girlfriends in 2003 : ( L - R ) Sheila Levell , Izabella St. James , Zoe Gregory , Holly Madison , Bridget Marquardt and Cristal Camden .
Credit : Reuters
Being a Hefner Girlfriend was a specialised job , not to be confused with being a Playboy Playmate .
In fact , Girlfriends were not allowed to become Playmates because Hef had found that they tended to flee the Mansion as soon as they collected their $ 25,000 Playmate cheque .
Girlfriends were given their own bedroom , an allowance of $ 1,000 a week in cash , a new car , free dental and medical treatment , almost limitless clothes , hairdos , make - up and facials and all the cosmetic surgery they could wish for - Izabella reckons
Hef shelled out $ 70,000 a year on breast implants .
It was a very generous deal in many ways , but it did have its drawbacks .
First , there was a strict curfew , so unless you were out with Hef , you had to be back in the hutch by 9 pm .
Second , while you could order any food or drink you wanted , at any time , from one of the many Mansion " butlers " , you were not allowed into the kitchen , even for a glass of water .
And third , of course , you had to live in the extraordinarily dingy Playboy mansion , where all the furniture was falling apart , the mattresses were stained and the carpets were covered in dog poo .
I remember visiting it in the early Nineties and being struck by its shabbiness then , and evidently it was the same or worse when Izabella moved in .
Part of the trouble might be that Hef does not actually own the mansion ; he has to rent it , room by room , from Playboy Enterprises and , according to Izabella , pays $ 25,000 a month for his own bedroom .
Today we ’re going to compare the websites of two monumental companies : Apple and Microsoft .
The two giants pride themselves for producing cutting edge consumer and business products , and are leading the developments in software and hardware .
But what about their websites ?
How do they both compare , and more important , which one is better and more usable ?
Well , in this article we ’ll take a look at both websites for closer examination from a usability point of view .
One important thing to note before we proceed to compare these two websites is that each company ’s business revolves around different markets .
Microsoft primarily makes its profits from business to business , which mainly consists of selling licenses to its operating system to computer manufacturers and office suites for enterprises .
That ’s not to say that they do n’t sell to consumers — they do , and they have consumer only product lines as well , such as the Xbox gaming console , and of course home users also buy Windows and Office .
This means that their business targets pretty much everyone , from home computer owners to developers and enterprises ; which in turn stretches the purpose of their website to try and serve everyone .
On the other hand , Apple is primarily a consumer company , and makes most of its profit selling hardware , like its iPod music players and Mac computers .
This makes the target of Apple ’s site much clearer — marketing , selling and providing support for its products to consumers .
They do n’t have to worry about selling licenses to manufacturers because they ’re the only manufacturer , so the key purpose of the website would be to advertise and promote their multiple product lines , as well as selling them through their online store .
1. Homepage
The homepage is one of the most important pages of the whole site because it ’s the first , and in many cases the only chance you get to impress the visitor enough to keep them browsing .
You ’ve got a few seconds to convince them that the site has enough value for them to keep using it , because if it does n’t , the visitors will leave .
Apple ’s approach to the homepage has been consistent throughout all the years that the site has been running .
They use this page as a kind of advertising board that always shows a big ad of their latest product , followed by 3 other ads to another 3 products or news that is important at the moment .
If you ’re not interested in any of the 4 suggested items , you can use the large navigation bar at the top , which is split into their core businesses : Mac , iPod and iPhone , followed by a couple of other important links , such as the online store and support pages .
The navigation bar also incorporates a search field .
The interesting thing here is that the main ad at the top is huge — indeed it almost covers the entire page .
If this does n’t grab your attention then nothing will .
Apple knows the importance of getting the customer ’s attention using good marketing , so they ’re not afraid to really go for it .
One other thing to note is the lack of content .
You ’re not distracted by sidebars , notices or extra navigation items — there are only a few items on the page , focusing your attention and making the decision of where to go next easier .
Microsoft has a different approach to their homepage .
Firstly , they feature a similar style of ad at the top , designed to be attention grabbing .
These are large images , but only one out of 3 ads is shown at a time — you have to hover over the other two to expand them .
This focuses attention , but may potentially weaken the effectiveness of the two hidden ads since the visitor has to work to see them .
Right at the top of the page is the navigation , together with search .
What ’s below the main ads is more interesting though .
As I mentioned previously , Microsoft ’s business operates in many markets , including both business to business and business to consumer .
The space below acts as a set of highlights and news for these various areas of the business .
One big problem with the content featured here is that it ’s fairly boring and overwhelming , with a lot of information packed into a very small space , without anything try to make it scannable .
Sure , it ’s broken down into bullet points , but the font is small and there are hardly any images to differentiate between the items .
As it stands , there is little to attract me to make me want to read through this content because it ’s just , well … boring .
2. Flow
What I mean by flow is this : is the site structured and laid out in such a way that I can easily find items to focus on ?
Do I know what to read after I focus on those items — is the site design directing me across the page with less effort on my part , or do I have to work to try and navigate around the content to find what I need ?
Here ’s the MobileMe section on Apple.com :
I think Apple has done a great job at structuring all of their pages .
Here , the first thing you focus on is probably the picture on the right and then the large headline on the left .
After you ’ve read the headline you can proceed to read the marketing blurb below , which leads nicely into a call to action signup button for the free trial .
If you ’re not interested in the trial , there are more features below to persuade you , each one ending with a “ Learn more ” link to a more detailed feature page .
This leaves no dead ends and keeps the user browsing .
Microsoft seems hit and miss in this department .
Here ’s the SharePoint section :
Yes , there is a focal point at the top that grabs your attention — the large quote and the image of a server — but what ’s next ?
All of the content below is extremely monotonous , especially the “ Learn More ” box with a list of 8 links .
The dry presentation gives the user less incentive to click around .
Some Microsoft sites use better layout to direct the flow of attention , but they generally all suffer from the same illness : too much content .
When you present the user with too many choices , you make them work — they have to think about what they want and they have to process more information .
By reducing choice , Apple directs the users through a more carefully designed funnel , which generally delivers a better experience .
3. Navigation
Apple ’s website has a large navigation bar at the top , which remains there consistently whichever section of the site you go to .
The options available show the main sections split by its lines of business as well as a couple of essentials , such as support and the store .
The bar also integrates search and branding as the home button displays the Apple logo instead of a label .
Any extra sub-navigation is located on individual site pages and is placed within the context of that page , whether on a sidebar , or as a horizontal bar at the top .
Microsoft has a similar navigation bar on the homepage , but that navigation bar is not consistent across the site .
Actually , all of the sub - pages tend to use their own navigation bar , in style and in content .
The homepage navigation thus acts as a site map to the rest of the Microsoft website sections .
In a lot of the navigation bars , including the one on the homepage , Microsoft uses drop - down menus — unlike Apple .
They do n’t just use drop - down menus — they use huge drop - down menus .
In some cases , the menu even has a scrollbar ( in Firefox ) :
Is this good or bad ?
In a recent Alertbox entry , Jakob Nielsen , a well known usability guru , has written that mega drop - down menus can work .
They work because they present a lot of choices in groups , so they allow for easier scanning as you can jump to the group that you want and scan the items inside them .
You have to get certain things right though , like the order of the groups and only mentioning each element once , for them to work well .
In this case , I think it makes sense for Microsoft to go the route of the drop - down menus , but I feel that they may have gone a little too far .
For example , some options point to the same thing , like the ‘ Office ’ drop down and ‘ Office ’ option in the ‘ All Products ’ drop down .
The drop - down also blocks the content below , so if you accidentally moused over the menu , you have to mouse off from it again to get to the content below — all the while being careful not to hover over other items .
There are also a lot of options under each group — sometimes showing about 13 items , which makes processing the options much more difficult .
Also , the inconsistency of navigation across the different sections makes it much harder to jump from one area of the site to another , e.g from the Office site to the Xbox site .
4. Readability
Because most of the content on the sites is text , it ’s vital to ensure that everything is readable and legible .
Here are the main things to consider when working on readability of your site ’s content :
Make the text large enough so that it ’s easy to see and read .
Ensure that there is enough contrast between the text and background .
Provide enough white space around the text to keep other content and graphics from distracting the reader .
Provide plenty of headings or highlighted / bold text to allow users to quickly scan the content for key information .
Add images and icons to make it easier to focus on individual sections of the text , i.e. product or feature descriptions .
Keep the text short and to the point .
Let ’s see how Microsoft and Apple fare in this area .
Here ’s a typical page on the Apple.com website :
Apple does a great job of keeping everything easy to read .
The text is generally small , but never too small so as to be a problem .
Headings are set in heavier type and stand out , allowing you to quickly get the gist of each section .
Apple also makes heavy use of white space to separate everything apart and adds images to make each text blurb more interesting .
Here ’s a typical page from Microsoft.com from the Windows section :
It follows the general usability guidelines by breaking things down into small bite size pieces of text that are easy to digest .
It looks a lot busier than the Apple site because there is more content on one page and there are many different treatments for headings and highlighted words .
Too much variety causes visual chaos on the page , with each different colored or bold item competing for your attention .
In this case , the page really needs to be simplified to make it easier for the viewer to process .
Here ’s another page , this time from the Microsoft security section :
The text on this page is probably a little too small to be comfortable to read , and the site needs more white space around the content to separate the text .
Let ’s see what a really busy page on Apple ’s site looks like :
This is the Apple store .
Really busy with lots of products and category links everywhere .
Fonts get pretty small to allow more content to fit in , although good use of white space ensures things are still usable .
5. Search
Apple ’s search is integrated into the navigation bar .
When you type something in the search box you actually get live search results with AJAX , by way of a little box which pops up , showing you the results as you type .
It ’s very well done — there is no lag when typing , the results are grouped in categories and are fetched very quickly , usually before you finish typing your full query .
Here ’s what it looks like :
If you want to see more results you can just hit Enter when you ’ve finished typing and you ’ll be taken to the standard search results page .
It ’s very clean and organized by categories .
You can drill the results further down by category , selectable from the menu on the right .
It ’s functional and clean , and works well when you ’re trying to find any products that they sell .
Microsoft has a more familiar search results page that looks a lot like Google ( or any other search engine these days ) .
That ’s because it uses Microsoft ’s own Live search engine .
It ’s certainly good at finding what you ’re looking for and got the results that I wanted .
The format of the results is one big list , which makes sense for Microsoft because of the nature of their business , with a lot of sub - pages and different content to search through .
It ’s functional , but the look and feel is different to the other pages , which makes it look like you ’re browsing a different website .
6. Aesthetics
Apple ’s website aesthetics closely mirrors that of its product line .
The navigation bar looks like it ’s crafted out of aluminum and features gentle gradients and indented text .
There are also plenty of reflections and minimalist design elements .
Apple has always worked on unifying the look and feel of its interface across its entire product line , from the hardware to software , and their website is no exception .
Do aesthetics have anything to do with usability ?
Actually , they do .
Research shows that people perceive better looking interfaces as more usable .
Attractive interfaces will set better first impressions and may even make their users more tolerable to problems .
So how does Microsoft fare in the aesthetics department ?
Here ’s the Internet Explorer 8 page :
The site follows a faint Windows theme with the light blue clouds , but there is little else to say that this is a page for Internet Explorer or Windows .
The look and feel is very generic and does n’t do enough to differentiate itself or build a coherent brand .
Here ’s another page ; this is the Download Center :
Again , we have a completely different design , although the light blue color is used here too for the backgrounds .
If there was no title on the page , could you tell that this is a Microsoft or Windows page ?
Probably not .
The designs are overall pretty good , but pretty good just is n’t enough .
There are plenty of inconsistencies and a lack of polish , which puts Apple ahead in this area .
7. Consistency
Consistency is important because it allows you to develop usage patterns .
This basically means that if your site has a consistent interface throughout , your visitors will quickly learn how it works and will be able to use this knowledge in any of the new pages that they visit , since they ’ll all be using the same , or very similar , interface .
Apple does a great job of keeping the interface consistent .
All of the product pages feature very similar aesthetics and are structured in the same way .
The whole site looks and feels the same throughout and the global navigation bar at the top is always there , on every page .
This means that the entire experience is very unified and coherent — you know you ’re on the same website wherever you go .
Here ’s a Microsoft page for the Azure platform :
Could you tell that this is a Microsoft page if you took away their logo ?
Custom graphics , styles and color palettes across all the Microsoft sections help little to maintain a coherent brand image on the web .
Microsoft really struggles here .
There are many different sections across Microsoft.com and they all feature their own look and feel , including their own navigation .
So once you go to a section on their site , be it the Microsoft store , the Office site , or the Security pages , they will all look and feel like separate websites .
What ’s worse , the global navigation bar is also gone , meaning that you have to go back to the homepage , or the site map , to see an overview of all of their sites .
It ’s really an ecosystem of websites hosted under the same domain and therefore it does n’t get the benefit of consistency that Apple has .
The brand image is also terribly fragmented making it impossible to define what a Microsoft site looks like .
Conclusion
Which site is the winner ?
If you ’re looking at usability alone , Apple comes out ahead .
They have a better designed homepage that offers less choice , which means the user needs to think less .
They have consistent navigation across all of their pages .
They use a lot of white space and sub - headings to make everything more readable , yet they keep things simple by not overusing too many different text treatments .
The Apple site is generally more user friendly and offers a much better experience to consumers who use it to check out Apple ’s latest products .
Having said this , the Apple website is much smaller in scale than Microsoft ’s site .
Unlike Apple , Microsoft hosts many different sites and sections under the Microsoft.com brand , creating a whole ecosystem of sub-sites .
Each site is packed with information and the Live powered search that Microsoft offers tends to yield good results .
The biggest problem for Microsoft is consistency .
Microsoft just does n’t have a consistent , coherent and unified brand .
Every section looks and feels different .
There is no global navigation and there are not many visual clues that tell the user that this is a Microsoft site — unlike Apple , where the whole site shares one unique aesthetic that mirrors that of their hardware and software , thus creating a powerful brand .
For these reasons , I think Apple is the clear winner here .

The Transactional Memory Specification Drafting Group , made up in part by representatives from Intel , IBM , and Sun , has released the first version of the Draft Specification of Transactional Language Constructs for C ++.
This specification introduces transactional language constructs for C++ , which are intended to make concurrent programming easier by allowing programmers to express compound statements that do not interact with other threads , without specifying the synchronization that is required to achieve this .
This specification builds on the upcoming C++0 x specification .
As such , the constructs described in this specification have well - defined behavior only for programs with no data races .
This specification specifies how the transactional constructs contribute to determining whether a program has a data race .
The __transaction keyword can be used to indicate that a compound statement should execute as an atomic transaction ; that is , the compound statement does not observe changes made by other threads during its execution , and other threads do not observe its partial results before it completes .
Furthermore , the compound statement takes effect in its entirety if it takes effect at all .
Thus , programmers can think of an atomic transaction statement as taking effect " instantaneously " , which greatly simplifies reasoning about interactions between concurrent threads .
Two additional syntactic features allow the programmer to specify expressions and functions that should execute as atomic transactions .
For details , see the draft here .
( CNN ) -- A Florida plumber was found guilty Friday of kidnapping and murdering a police detective 's daughter at a trial in which his victim 's voice filled the courtroom as her desperate 911 call was played to the jury .
Denise Lee 's frantic 911 call was the centerpiece of her killer 's trial .
Jurors deliberated just two hours before finding Michael L. King , 38 , guilty of first - degree murder , kidnapping and sexual battery in the January 17 , 2008 abduction and slaying of Denise Amber Lee , a 21 - year - old mother of two .
Lee 's family , including her father , Charlotte County Sheriff 's Det. Rick Goff , cried as the verdict was announced ; King showed no reaction .
The jury must next decide whether King , who was a stranger to Lee , should be executed for his crimes .
According to testimony during the weeklong trial , Lee was taken from her home sometime after 2 p.m. , driven to King 's home , sexually assaulted , then shot in the head and buried in a ditch .
Watch King listen to the verdict »
King 's attorney , Jerry Meisner , did not present any witnesses .
But prosecutors told the jury that Lee 's ring was found in King 's car , and hair matching hers was found on duct tape found at King 's house .
According to testimony and court records ,
Lee fought frantically for her life , banging on the windows of King 's green Camaro , screaming for help and begging one witness , " Call the cops . "
Watch the defendant as he hears the 911 tape »
Several people reported seeing something suspicious and called 911 .
But authorities did n't find Lee in time , and allegations that dispatchers mishandled the calls have led to criticism of the local 911 system .
Lee 's body was found on January 19 near where police stopped King 's car some six hours after the abduction .
The jury heard two 911 calls -- Lee 's and one from a concerned witness .

Lee used one of King 's cell phones to call 911 as she was driven across three counties .
As the six - minute tape was played for the jury , her voice sounded tremulous at times , and frantic at others .
The call came in at 6:14 p.m. on January 17 .
A 911 operator repeatedly said " Hello , " and Lee was heard pleading with her captor : " I 'm sorry .
I just want to see my family .
... I just want to see my family again .
Please . ...
Oh please , I just want to see my family again .
Let me go . "
The man , whose voice was identified in court as King 's , cursed at her for trying to attract attention .
A radio played loudly in the background .
The 911 operator asked her address .
Eventually , Lee managed to say , " My name is Denise .
I 'm married to a beautiful husband and I just want to see my kids again .
...
Please , God , please protect me . "
The 911 operator asked where she was , and then whether she knew the man .
The operator asked if she knew her location .
" Please just take me to my house .
Can you take me home ? "
Lee said .
The connection was then lost .
Sixteen minutes later , driver Jane Kowalski called 911 to report what she thought was a child abduction .
She said she was stopped at a light and could hear screaming from another car " and not a happy scream , a get - me - out - of - here scream . "
She testified that she saw someone banging on the car window , slapping her hand hard to demonstrate .
" It was very loud , " she told the jury .
" It was completely horrific , terrified , panicky .
I can't think of enough words , it was terrible . "
She followed the car for a while , but lost it .
Police quickly traced Lee 's call to King 's cell phone , and were looking for him .
But Kowalski's call was never passed on to officers .
Other witnesses also helped establish the timeline for the terrifying final hours of Lee 's life .
Lee 's former neighbor , Jennifer Eckert , 24 , testified that she saw the green Camaro circle the block three or four times between 1 and 2 p.m. and pull into the Lees ' driveway .
She said she was certain of the time , because she was watching her favorite TV soap .
King 's cousin , Harold Muxlow , testified that King stopped by his house between 5:30 and 6 p.m. , and asked to borrow a flashlight , a gas can , and a shovel .
He testified that a " girl 's voice " from the car asked him to " call the cops " but Muxlow said King told him , " Do n't worry .
It 's nothing . "
The 911 communications breakdown in connection with Kowalski's call was blamed on a shift change and two dispatchers were suspended , according to the St. Petersburg Times .
Lee 's husband , Nathan , has launched a foundation bearing her name that works toward 911 reform .
He plans to file a lawsuit next month , a family spokesman said .

Some time in the 1800's , it was quite a popular trend to shorten down names , and change letters .
Which is why there are shortenings of names , such as ; Richard / Dick , William / Bill , and Edward / Ted .
The UK population is now growing by 0.7 % every year The UK population grew by 408,000 in 2008 - the biggest increase for almost 50 years , according to the Office for National Statistics .
The total number of people passed 61 m for the first time , with changes in birth and death rates now a bigger cause of growth than immigration .
The numbers of people arriving minus those leaving actually fell by 44 % .
Minister Phil Woolas said migrants were coming for short periods , contributing to the economy and then going home .
The UK population grew more in 2008 than at any time since 1962 , when it rose by 484,000 .
Latest ONS figures also show :
There are now a record 1.3 million people aged over 85 , making up 2 % of the total
There were 791,000 babies born in 2008 , an increase of 33,000 on 2007
Half of that increase were to women born overseas , but living in the UK
The population is now growing by 0.7 % a year , more than double the rate in the 1990s and three times the level of the 1980s .
' Shambolic ' Overall , 118,000 more people arrived in the UK than left in 2008 - the lowest level since EU enlargement .
Mr Woolas said this fall in net migration was proof that " only those that Britain needs can come " into the country .
" Britain 's borders are stronger than ever before .
Our border controls in northern France are stopping record numbers of migrants reaching our shores - 28,000 in 2008 , " he said .
" The British people can be confident that immigration is under control . "
But opposition parties disagreed .
The Liberal Democrats called the immigration system " shambolic , " saying the true number of new arrivals could be much higher because of " the continuing lack of control over our borders " .
Shadow immigration minister Damian Green said : " This puts added pressure on housing and transport , and shows that there is still no proper control over immigration numbers . "
Campaign group MigrationWatch UK also dismissed Mr Woolas ' claims .

" It is the usual government spin to claim these numbers as a success for immigration policy despite the fact that foreign immigration is virtually unchanged at about half a million a year , " chairman Sir Andrew Green told the BBC .
" What has really happened is that EU citizens have voted with their feet - the number leaving has doubled in the face of the deep recession in Britain . "
Sir Andrew also said the government 's points - based system to control non-EU immigration had so far " had very little effect " .
' Scaremongering ' Tim Finch from the left - leaning think tank , the Institute for Public Policy Research , said migration tended to work in cycles .
The need for firm measures on immigration is unchanged
Labour MP Frank Field and Tory Nicholas Soames
" It is now declining sharply - almost certainly because of a combination of the economic downturn , the short term nature of much migration from new EU countries , and the impact of stronger controls put in place by the government , " he said .
" There has been a lot of irresponsible scaremongering about immigration in recent years which was based on the false assumption that high migration was inevitable for years to come . "
But Labour MP Frank Field and Tory Nicholas Soames , members the Cross Party Group on Balanced Migration , issued a joint statement saying the fall in net migration may well be temporary .
" Even at the present level of immigration , we are still on target for the UK 's population to exceed 70 million within 25 years , " they said .
" There are no laurels to rest on .
The need for firm measures on immigration is unchanged .
The public clearly understand this . "
Donna Covey from the Refugee Council said the government had to keep the door open to genuine asylum seekers .
" We must make sure that the focus on strengthening Britain 's borders does not prevent people fleeing for their lives from getting to safety here in the UK , " she said .

Christmas is one of those Holidays that is supposed to be a very wholesome family event .
While this means most people try to generally follow the rules and stick to the tried and true Christmas traditions , you always have a few bad apples who have to stray from what society says is the norm .
These are the same people who come up with the genuinely creative and sometimes disturbing Christmas ornaments you wind up seeing all over the Internet .
Personally I 'm a bit of a creature of habit , so it is hard for me to break the norm on stuff like Christmas .
For example , it took moving into an apartment building where real Christmas
Trees were n't aloud before I finally conformed and purchased my first .
While it seemed anti Christmas to me for years , after finally taking the leap to the world of fake trees , I 've been pretty damn happy ever since .
In all honesty , vacuuming up all those needles every second day and having my car urinate all over the base of the tree really was n't that appealing , especially to my girlfriend .
Anyways , I 've considered trying out weird themes for Christmas Tree , and I 've spent a few hours scouring the net for what could be some good future ideas , but nothing really stands out to me except for possibly the idea of a Super Mario themed Christmas Tree !
Well , without further ado , I introduce you to some very weird Christmas Ornaments .
If you grew up in the 1980's then this is the perfect tree for you !
Not only is it covered in Marios , Link's , The guy from Castlevania , but it even has that awesome bubble spitting Bubble Bobble Character ; I loved that game !
If you can't figure out why a Chanukah ornament is kind of twisted , I feel for you .
If you are n't educated in other religion 's holidays , Jewish folk do n't celebrate Christmas but instead celebrate Chanukah around the same time .
Since Jewish people do n't celebrate Christmas , they do n't have Christmas trees , this is a colossal business fail for somebody !
This specialty Bill Clinton ornament is clearly hand made , but hop in a time machine and head back ten years and you know you would have got a good chuckle out of it .
I 'm sure half the people reading this now probably are n't even old enough to get the joke .
For the younger folk , Google is your friend , look it up !
Based on the size of Bambi's pupils in this picture , he ate a few too many mushrooms and by the looks of them they were magic !
Children , do n't do this at home !
Now this Christmas ornament is a must have for any aspiring terrorist in your family .
Nothing says I love you to a terrorist like a Grenade , a few Bin Laden heads .
Are you a little too into Star Trek ?
Want the world to know ?
Rip your old PC 's apart and cut fancy shapes from your old mother boards .
A hole punch and a piece of string completes your freshly made camouflage nerdy Christmas Tree ornaments .
I 'm not even sure the Mooning Santa even comes in a version that you can hang from your tree , but rest assured if I had a dozen of these I 'd be finding away to ensure they were attached to my tree before my friends and family came over for a nice cup of egg nog ( and rum ) .
Are you an aspiring proctologist ?
Have you spent the last ten years of your life studying anal cavities so you can spend the rest of your life treating them ?
Do n't fret future proctologist , your Christmas would not be complete with a steaming pile of poo ornament to compliment your Christmas tree !
This is pretty much the weirdest ornament I 've ever come across , a baby in utero rocking what looks to be an AK47 .
Pretty wholesome if you ask me .
This is one of my favorites , because I love all things bacon .
If I did n't have two pesky cats who eat anything I leave out , I probably would have had the Bacon Christmas Tree out on display last year .
My whole life I 've been led to believe that Maxi Pads were the only female hygene product that multiple purposes ( they give you wings ) .
Turns out I was wrong , Tampons apparently have multiple uses as well !
Mix , match and paint your varying tampons to make a very festive and budget minded Christmas Tree .
There are lots of incredible things you can do with data .
Like make this incredible animation of the Martian …
I actualy have a story in the making that is like this ,
book name :
the infected war
beginning 's summary :
a bio-terrorist cell somewhere in iran just bio -misled everyone with zombie virus , the remmanents of the USA are now trying to hold their ground against the zombie horde
relation : a lost battle
chapter name :
blood apple
battle name :
the battle of apple town ( hence the chapter name )
place :
apple town ( duh )
backrond :
after the smoke cleared on th coast , a zombie horde moved toured the center of the U.S. , ( heading back now ) when the millions ( yes millions ) of missiles where spotted on radar , the U.S. tried to evacuate everyone , especialy the pres .
and the genearals .
thoughts :
the battle of apple town was a single part of an attempt to keep the zombies at the coast , but that mission failed misserably , and the U.S. arm had to retreat to the northern central states ( wisconsin , minesota , michagin area ) .
the armys :
the U.S. army :
had set up a large barracade and defense group that had : 2,000 troops on foot , 100 tanks , 10 artilary cannons 10 artilary trucks and 300 APCs
the zombies : a horde 20,000 strong 100 tanks and 100 chargers ( the zombie kind ) 1,000 hunters ( again the zombie kind ) and 5,000 spitters ( yet again the zombie kind , and yes - theese are from L4D )
the battle ( how it happened ) :
the zombies came full force and were immidiatly hit with a barrage of artilary shells and tank shells , but only a small % of the zombie horde was killed by the cannons and the horde slammed down on the barracade , the front line was caught in a hudge mele fight .
The ( army ) tanks found themselves under fire from acid globs and thrown rocks , and the ( army ) tanks responded with a barrage of shells , and the ground was covered in blood , in about 4 hours 9/10 of all living things on the battlefeild ( zombie or otherwise ) were DEAD , and by that point the army was in retreat .
aftermath :
units left :
army :
about 100 soldiers , 1 tank , 1 artilary truck and 30 apc's .
zombies :
about 10 tanks and 10 chargers , 2,000 horde ,
300 hunters and 231 spitters .
sorry for the long comment
Very cool .

The pistol found at the scene of the shooting that killed former NFL quarterback Steve McNair and his girlfriend was purchased by the woman two nights before , police said Monday .
Steve McNair , 36 , spent 13 seasons in the NFL , the majority with the Tennessee Titans .
McNair , 36 , and Sahel Kazemi , 20 , were found fatally shot in a condominium in downtown Nashville , Tennessee , on Saturday afternoon .
McNair was shot twice in the head and twice in the chest , and Kazemi was shot once in the head , authorities said .
Police found a semiautomatic pistol beneath Kazemi's body and determined that she bought it Thursday night , Nashville Metropolitan Police Department Spokesman Don Aaron said Tuesday .
Authorities classified McNair 's death a homicide but had not decided how to classify Kazemi's .
Police found the couple after receiving a phone call about an injured person .
Asked whether the shooting was a murder - suicide , Aaron said investigators had ruled out nothing .
" I would expect that it would be a number of days before the classification is placed on Miss Kazemi 's death , " he said .
McNair , a married father of four , and Kazemi " apparently were involved in a dating relationship over the past several months , " Aaron said .
Watch Aaron talk about the crime and McNair 's relationship with Kazemi »
There were no signs of forced entry at the condo , which was rented by McNair and a friend of his , sporting - goods dealer Wayne Neeley , Aaron said .
Neeley used a key to enter the building and discovered the clothed bodies Saturday afternoon , Aaron said .
" The two had been dead for a period of hours prior to the bodies being discovered , " Aaron said .
Do n't Miss Former NFL QB Steve McNair found shot to death
Neeley then called his friend Robert Gaddy , who went to the condo and called police .
Asked why Neeley had not called police himself , Aaron said , " My conjecture would be that he was shocked and horrified by what he had just discovered and , for some reason , his inclination was to contact Mr. Gaddy , who was a close friend of Mr. Neeley 's and Mr. McNair's . "
Witnesses told police that McNair had been at the Blue Moon Lagoon Bar and the Loser 's Bar , both Nashville establishments , late Friday into early Saturday , Aaron said .
Staff and management of both bars will be interviewed , he said .
Neighbors said a Cadillac Escalade driven by Kazemi -- registered to her and McNair -- was in the condominium parking lot when McNair arrived about 1:30 a.m .
" The presumption is she was there when he arrived , " Aaron said .
Police are also interviewing Kazemi 's former boyfriend , Aaron said .
The bodies were found two days after Kazemi was pulled over in the Escalade and charged with driving under the influence , Aaron said .
McNair was in the car at the time .
Kazemi's sister , Sepide Kazemi , said she suspected that her sister was the other fatality when she heard on the news Saturday afternoon that McNair and someone else had been found dead .
" We had a feeling that it was her , because she would be the only young woman with him at that time , as far as we knew , " Sepide Kazemi told CNN affiliate WSMV .
McNair spent 13 seasons in the NFL , most with the Tennessee Titans .
He was named the NFL 's co-MVP in 2003 and spent his last two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens , before announcing his retirement in April 2008 .
He led the Titans to the 2000 Super Bowl , which they lost to the St. Louis Rams .
McNair attended Alcorn State in Mississippi .

Cheney refuses to turn over his records to Bush library David Edwards and John Byrne
Published : Tuesday April 7 , 2009

It appears that Vice President Dick Cheney 's penchant for keeping things close continues even beyond his term .
The former deputy commander - in - chief wo n't even turn his records over to the library of President George W. Bush , though he originally appeared to be willing to do so .
" As the Republican Party searches for meaning in the political minority , one of the men who put them in the political memory , Dick Cheney , does not want his records out of his clutches , especially if they were to go to the George W. Bush presidential library in Dallas anytime soon , " MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow reported Monday evening .
Bush 's number two says he needs his records to stay in Washington so he can tap them for his memoirs .
Last year , one of the architects of Bush 's library wrote to the National Archives that " we received a call from [ George W. Bush Foundation president ]
Mark Langdale that the Vice Presidential holdings will now be located at the GWBPL [ George W. Bush Presidential Library ] " and asked for assistance in revising the library 's blueprints .
But according to the Dallas News , there was a " miscommunication . "
Keeping vice presidential records at the National Archives is not unusual -- Al Gore opted for his records to remain there after leaving office .
But Cheney 's obsession with secrecy and control have raised liberal eyebrows over the revelation .
A 2007 article in The Washington Post revealed that Cheney 's obsession with controlling information goes so far as to involve the purging of Secret Service visitor logs .
" Across the board , the vice president 's office goes to unusual lengths to avoid transparency , " the Post 's Barton Gellman wrote .
" Cheney declines to disclose the names or even the size of his staff , generally releases no public calendar and ordered the Secret Service to destroy his visitor logs .
MSNBC 's Maddow delivered the news tongue - in - cheek .
" This means that the space set aside for Vice President Cheney 's official and personal records in the Bush library will remain empty , a void where information should be , " she remarked .
" You know , that 's how I 'll always think of him . "
" It made more sense and was more convenient to keep them in D.C. , " a Cheney spokesman told the Dallas News .

In what may be a major development , it is being alleged that Iranian opposition leader Mir Hosain Mousavi and his wife Zahra Rahnavard are calling for a general strike next week .
Such a strike would be harder for the regime to forestall than crowds coming into the streets , and whether it has a big effect or not would be a way of measuring the support for the reformists in the country .
Predictably , hard liners in the Iranian parliament are calling for Mousavi to be arrested .
As it is , seven members of what the regime calls “ anti- government groups ” from Tehran and Qazvin were arrested yesterday .
Not satisfied with having held an Egyptian - style election , some Iranian politicians apparently want to adopt the Burmese model .
How do you say “ Myanmar ” in Persian ?
A
Meanwhile , one price the regime will pay for phonying up the election results and violently repressing peaceful demonstrations is even greater diplomatic isolation .
Although this LA Times piece questions whether sanctions will be tightened , I think that is also a possible outcome .
Many Iranians are fearful that what was done to Iraq , in reducing it to a fourth - world country , will ultimately be done to Iran by the US / UNSC if things go on like this .
The 27 - member European Union is intervening with Iran over the holding of British embassy personnel .
This is a powerful intervention .
One third of all Iran ’s trade is with the EU and it is Iran ’s number one trading partner .
The EU imported 11.3 bn. Euros in goods from Iran in 2008 and exported 14 bn .
Euros to Iran– maninly “ machinery and transport equipment ( 54.6 % ) , manufactured goods ( 16.9 % ) and chemicals ( 12.1 % ) . “

Chevron owes more to Richmond
This week , Fortune magazine released its list of the 500 largest corporations in the world .
With a nearly 25 percent increase in its revenues from 2007 , Chevron Corp. moved from the sixth to the fifth largest corporation in the world .
Only 36 countries on the planet had GDPs larger than Chevron 's $ 263 billion in 2008 revenues .
By revenue , Chevron is the largest corporation in California , the second - largest U.S. oil corporation and the third - largest corporation in the nation .
Chevron 's nearly $ 24 billion in profits for 2008 were its largest on record and the fourth - highest profits of any corporation in the world .
Chevron 's profits have increased every year since 2002 , increasing by an astounding 2,100 percent .
Those who have not benefited are the Richmond community , the site of Chevron 's oldest refinery , and the state of California .
In November , Richmond voters passed Measure T .
At the current price of oil , it would provide the city with an additional $ 16 million annually from Chevron ( adding 11 percent to the city 's tax revenues ) .
Chevron sued , challenging the new tax .
Chevron has also repeatedly blocked state initiatives to impose a severance tax on oil extracted in the state .
California is the only major oil producing state in the nation without such a tax .
It is estimated that imposition of a severance tax could bring in over $ 1 billion a year to the California state budget .
Moreover , the Los Angeles Times reports Chevron 's role in lobbying to keep initiatives to increase corporate taxation more broadly off the table in the state 's budget negotiations .
The Chevron Richmond refinery is already the largest industrial polluter in the Bay Area .
The Environmental Protection Agency reported nearly 100,000 pounds of toxic waste from the site in 2007 , including more than 4,000 pounds of benzene , a known human carcinogen .
The refinery is now , and has been , listed as in " high priority violation " of air compliance standards , among other violations , by the EPA every year since at least 2006 .
Chevron now wants to retool the refinery to burn heavier crude that can be much more polluting than lighter grades .
The senior scientist at Richmond 's Communities for a Better Environment has found no technological fix available to ensure that a refinery can mitigate this type of pollution .
CBE joined other community health and environmental groups to block the retooling , and the court ruled in their favor .
The groups are now asking the city to better regulate the refinery by specifically capping the type of crude it can refine to ban the heavier more polluting grades .
Chevron has said it plans to appeal the ruling .
( It will also give Richmond community programs $ 565,000 in grants connected to the project . )
Unfortunately , Chevron had already begun construction at the refinery and subsequently laid off 1,100 workers .
Community groups have asked Chevron to instead work on necessary upgrades they have been demanding for years to make the refinery cleaner and safer - work that would create many jobs .
More beneficial to the long - term health of all who live in the city - including refinery workers - is not only a cleaner and safer refinery , but a company willing to give back to the communities within which it operates and the state it calls home .

The National Health Service has become the butt of increasingly outlandish political attacks in the US as Republicans and conservative campaigners rail against Britain 's " socialist " system as part of a tussle to defeat Barack Obama 's proposals for broader government involvement in healthcare .
Top-ranking Republicans have joined bloggers and well - funded free market organisations in scorning the NHS for its waiting lists and for " rationing " the availability of expensive treatments .
As myths and half - truths circulate , British diplomats in the US are treading a delicate line in correcting falsehoods while trying to stay out of a vicious domestic dogfight over the future of American health policy .
Slickly produced television advertisements trumpet the alleged failures of the NHS 's 61 - year tradition of tax - funded healthcare .
To the dismay of British healthcare professionals , US critics have accused the service of putting an " Orwellian " financial cap on the value on human life , of allowing elderly people to die untreated and , in one case , for driving a despairing dental patient to mend his teeth with superglue .
Having seen his approval ratings drop , Obama is seeking to counter this conservative onslaught by taking his message to the public , with a " town hall " meeting today at a school in New Hampshire .
Last week , the most senior Republican on the Senate finance committee , Chuck Grassley , took NHS - baiting to a newly emotive level by claiming that his ailing Democratic colleague , Edward Kennedy , would be left to die untreated from a brain tumour in Britain on the grounds that he would be considered too old to deserve treatment .
" I do n't know for sure , " said Grassley .
" But I 've heard several senators say that Ted Kennedy with a brain tumour , being 77 years old as opposed to being 37 years old , if he were in England , would not be treated for his disease , because end of life – when you get to be 77 , your life is considered less valuable under those systems . "
The degree of misinformation is causing dismay in NHS circles .
Andrew Dillon , chief executive of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) , pointed out that it was utterly false that Kennedy would be left untreated in Britain : " It is neither true nor is it anything you could extrapolate from anything we 've ever recommended to the NHS . "
Others in the US have accused Obama of trying to set up " death panels " to decide who should live and who should die , along the lines of Nice , which determines the cost - effectiveness of NHS drugs .
One right - leaning group , Conservatives for Patients ' Rights , lists horror stories about British care on its website .
An email widely circulated among US voters , of uncertain origin , claims that anyone over 59 in Britain is ineligible for treatment for heart disease .
The British embassy in Washington is quietly trying to counter inaccuracies .
A spokesman said : " We 're keeping a close eye on things and where there 's a factually wrong statement , we will take the opportunity to correct people in private .
That said , we do n't want to get involved in a domestic debate . "
A $ 1.2 m television advertising campaign bankrolled by the conservative Club for Growth displays images of the union flag and Big Ben while intoning a figure of $ 22,750 .
A voiceover says : " In England , government health officials have decided that 's how much six months of life is worth .
If a medical treatment costs more , you 're out of luck . "
The number is based on a ratio of £ 30,000 a year used by Nice in its assessment of whether drugs provide value for money .
Dillon said this was one of many variables in determining cost - effectiveness of medicines .
He said of his body 's portrayal in the US : " It 's very disappointing and it's not , obviously , the way in which Nice describes itself or the way in which we 're perceived in the UK even among those who are disappointed or upset by our decisions . "
On Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News channel , the conservative commentator Sean Hannity recently alighted upon the case of Gordon Cook , a security manager from Merseyside , who used superglue to stick a loose crown into his gum because he was unable to find an NHS dentist .
The cautionary tale , which was based on a Daily Mail report from 2006 , prompted Hannity to warn his viewers : " If the Democrats have their way , get your superglue ready . "
The broader tone of the US healthcare debate has become increasingly bitter .
The former vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin last week described president Obama 's proposals as " evil " , while the radio presenter Rush Limbaugh has compared a logo used for the White House 's reform plans to a Nazi swastika .
Hecklers have disrupted town hall meetings called to discuss the health reform plans .
David Levinthal , a spokesman for the nonpartisan Centre for Responsive Politics , said the sheer scale of the issue , which will affect the entire trajectory of US medical care , was arousing passions : " It 's no surprise you have factions from every political stripe attempting to influence the debate and some of those groups are certainly playing to the deepest fears of Americans .
There 's been a great deal of documented disinformation propagated throughout the country . "
Defenders of Britain 's system point out that the UK spends less per head on healthcare but has a higher life expectancy than the US .
The World Health Organisation ranks Britain 's healthcare as 18th in the world , while the US is in 37th place .
The British Medical Association said a majority of Britain 's doctors have consistently supported public provision of healthcare .
A spokeswoman said the association 's 140,000 members were sceptical about the US approach to medicine : " Doctors and the public here are appalled that there are so many people on the US who do n't have proper access to healthcare .
It 's something we would find very , very shocking . "

Poker is considered one of the most skillful of betting games , but a new study published in the Journal of Gambling Studies reports on an artificial neural network that predicts gambler ’s bets to three decimals places .
The system was built by researcher Victor Chan who created a relatively simply backpropogation neural network to predict future plays .
Backprop networks take a bunch of inputs , feed them through layers of loose mathematical simulations of neurons which then make a guess at an output .
Crucially , the network is initially given a set of training data on which it can modify its ‘ guesses ’ based on how wrong its initial estimation was .
The amount of error is fed back through the network and each ‘ neuron ’ adjusts the strengths of its connections to other neurons to minimise the error next time round .
Chan used the playing patterns of six online Texas Hold ’em players each of whom played more than 100 games each .
He entered just an initial series of games for each player to train the network and then asked it to predict how the following plays would go .
… it was to the author ‚Äôs surprise that the neural network for M1 upon training turned out to be able to predict a gambler ‚Äôs bet amounts in successive games accurately to more than three decimal places of the dollar on average for each of the six gamblers in our data sample across the board .
More importantly , the neural network for M2 upon training was also able to track the temporal trajectory of a gambler ‚Äôs cumulative winnings / losses , i.e. , successively predict the gambler ‚Äôs cumulative winnings / losses , with a similar accuracy again for each of the six gamblers in our data sample across the board .
… the influence of a gambler ‚Äôs skills , strategies , and personality on his / her cumulative winnings / losses is almost totally reflected by the pattern (s ) of his / her cumulative winnings / losses in the several immediately preceding games .
In other words , from a sample of initial plays , each gambler ’s behaviour was almost completely mathematically predictable in the same way across all six people .
Now , if they could only get a neural network to predict plays in strip poker , I think they ’d be onto something .

From the ' free as in freedom ' files :
As my colleague Michelle Menga is reporting , Amazon is now making new source code available for its Amazon Kindle .
Basically what it represents is , Amazon 's responsibility to make the GPL licenced source code that is used in the Kindle available to others .
That 's part of the GPL license and Amazon is doing its part .
Digging into the code that Amazon is now making available , provides some really interesting insight into the underlying structure of the Kindle .
For one , Kindle ( at least the DX ) is using a modified Linux 2.6.22 kernel .
This is a kernel that originally was released by Linus Torvalds in 2007 .
Is it a surprise that the Kindle is Linux powered ?
( not really ) .
Where there is LInux there are always some key Linux tools .
In the Kindle 's case that 's the GCC 4.1.2 release for code compilation .
In GCC terms that 's now an older release ( originally out in 2006 ) , so I would hope that Amazon moves to the newer GCC 4.4 over time as it could yield some performance gains for them .
Amazon is also using BusyBox ( how can you not if you 're running embedded ? ) , so it 's a good thing they 've released that code - BusyBox has been active in recent years by way of the Software Freedom Law Center ( SFLC ) in making sure that vendors that use their code actually comply with the GPL .
That does n't necessarily mean that those that back the GPL are entirely thrilled with Amazon .
In fact the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , actually refers to the Kindle ( somewhat less than politely ) as the ' Swindle ' .
" It 's good that Amazon is complying with the licenses and not behaving
illegally , but this is hardly something praiseworthy , " John Sullivan operations manager at the FSF blogged .
" Amazon benefited
from the freedoms passed on to them by other free software authors , and
that benefit comes with an obligation to convey that same freedom to
their users -- to share alike . "

I have been having fun playing with the free XNA Game Studio 3.1 .
Although I have a moderate ability with programming C# , there are excellent tutorial videos available at the XNA Game Studio site that walk you through every line of code you need to program a basic game .
One of the best ways to learn coding is to be fearless and hack away / reverse engineer code and see what the results are .
So long as you understand how and why you break the code and get bugs , you are learning how to do it yourself .
I find there is a serious lack of RPG content on Xbox 360 Indie Game marketplace so I did a search and lo and behold there is a recently uploaded starter kit for an RPG !
Once you have installed the free Microsoft ’s Visual Studio C# Express Starter Edition and XNA Game Studio 3.1 ( also free ) , you need simply download and install the RPG Game Starter Kit and can open it as a template from the software .
There are some basic XML based tutorials for how to create your own quests , and if you are feeling brave you can start the time - consuming process of creating your own custom Sprites and background textures to make the game feel more like your own .
If you want to make this a lot easier , consider using a free program like GraphicsGale to build , develop , animate and save your game sprites .
Because great RPGs are more about excellent storytelling and world - building than anything else , I encourage you to go and try this out .
I do caution that you may lose night after night of sleep as you descend into the limitless word of game building , but you will at least know that in the end you can submit your project for peer review and maybe ultimately turn a buck by selling your wares on Xbox Live .
Note : in order to test your game directly on your Xbox 360 , get reviewed or put it up for sale , you will have to purchase a premium membership – $ 99.95 annually .
However , you can still program games for Windows PCs that you can distribute to your friends – free .

There have been many fictional British spies
From Ian Fleming to John Le Carre - authors have long been fascinated by the world of espionage .
But , asks the BBC's Gordon Corera , what do real life spooks make of fictional spies ?
Much of what the public knows about the UK's Secret Service , or MI6 , comes from the world of fiction - whether Ian Fleming 's James Bond or John Le Carre 's George Smiley .
FIND OUT MORE ...
MI6 : A Century in the Shadows is a three - part series for BBC Radio 4
The first episode , Gadgets and Green Ink , will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 27 July at 0902 BST
Or listen again via iPlayer
The intertwining of fact and fiction dates back to the birth of the British intelligence service .
In the early years of the 20th Century , the British public was whipped into a frenzy of " spy mania " driven by novelists and newspapers .
It was an era in which the UK was fearful of the rise of Germany and particularly its navy .
William Le Queux wrote the novel , The Invasion of 1910 , which was serialised in the Daily Mail .
The paper took care to adjust the invasion route the Germans were supposed to take in order to include the towns where its circulation was highest .
There was a widespread belief that the Germans were everywhere , posing as waiters and barbers , stealing secrets and preparing for war .
Public pressure grew to do something and so a Secret Service Bureau was established .
One half , which would become MI5 , was designed to hunt for German spies .
The other , which would become MI6 , was to steal German secrets .
Older mythology
Even at that early stage , fiction was rubbing off on the real world of espionage , says Alan Judd , the biographer of Sir Mansfield Cumming , who was the first head of what became MI6 .
" Le Queux knew some of the people in the War Office , I had no doubt that he had some influence on it all - certainly the culture and the climate , " says Judd .
Sir Ian Fleming had experience from his time in naval intelligence
But the mythology created by fiction may have gone back even further , to the era of the Great Game - the battle between the British and Russian empires for supremacy of Central Asia , which began in the early 19th Century .
Britain had no professional spying service at the time , just the occasional gentleman amateur and soldier .
But their stories were written up for the public , most dramatically in Rudyard Kipling 's Kim .
These forerunners of the professional spy " did some very brave things " says Sir Colin McColl , MI6's chief between 1989 and 1994 .
" And so there was a sort of general feeling that this was a good thing done by brave people .
And that was followed by a whole series of authors in the first part of the 20th Century - [ John ] Buchan and so on .
I mean terrific stuff . "
Sir Mansfield Cumming was the first head of MI6
The fiction created a romanticism around spies which attracted many people to work for the service .
Among them was Daphne Park , who joined in the 1940s and rose to become a controller at MI6 .
" I suppose it did start with reading [ Rudyard Kipling 's ] Kim , reading John Buchan and reading Sapper and Bulldog Drummond and I think from a quite early age I did want to go into intelligence .
I did n't know what kind or how it would be .
But I always wanted it . "
As well as attracting individuals to sign up for desk jobs , the daring antics of fictional spies also helped MI6 in its core work of recruiting agents - people willing to spy for the service and pass on secrets .
" There have been a lot of people with whom we 've dealt across the world ... [ that ] have come to us or worked with us because they felt we knew far more than anybody else knew , " says Sir Colin .
This would be considered a poor outcome by most real - life spies
And much of the world knows MI6 though the man known as 007 .
James Bond 's creator Ian Fleming never served in MI6 but he did work in naval intelligence during World War II and modelled Bond on a number of real life intelligence officers .
His creation - particularly once it moved to cinema - has done much to define public perceptions of MI6 , although the real chief is called C not M. Egyptian intelligence services reportedly bought up copies of Fleming 's books to use on their training courses .
So do people think it is like Bond ?
" They usually do , " says Sir Colin . " [ But ] no it is n't you see we were not in the business of going out and shooting people down dark alleys .
That was a completely different world . "
But Bond still has his uses .
" Everybody watches Bond .
And so why should n't a little bit of Bond rub off on our reputation , " says Sir Colin .
" If you looked at the number of people who helped us at any one time , a large number of them were Brits who were doing it for nothing - perhaps a bottle of whisky at Christmas .
You know we had wonderful support and that is hugely valuable ... based on the reputation . "
However , Fleming 's character seems to have made less of an impression on the Russians , according to former KGB colonel Mikhail Lyubimov .
This would not be considered best practice for secretaries in the real MI6 " Bond was never considered to be a serious film in the KGB , " says Mr Lyubimov , curtly .
The other figure who has done much to shape the public understanding of MI6 is John le Carre .
The portrayal of often flawed characters draws a mixed reception from real life spies .
" I mean there were two feelings I think in the service over the years , " explains Sir Colin McColl .
" There were those who were furious with John Le Carre because he depicts everybody as such disagreeable characters and they are always plotting against each other and so on So people got rather cross about that .
" But I thought it was terrific because , again , it carried the name that had been provided by Bond and John Buchan and everybody else , it gave us another couple of generations of being in some way special . "
Ms Park , it 's fair to say , is not a fan .
" He dares to say that it is a world of cold betrayal .
It 's not .
It 's a world of trust .
You ca n't run an agent without trust on both sides . "
Le Carre , who served briefly in MI5 and MI6 , declined to be interviewed .
As the British Secret Service has come out of the shadows , some of the myth and mystery has certainly disappeared .
Some insiders believe this is inevitable and for the best , laying to rest some of the crazier ideas about the world of MI6 .
But there are a few , all the same , who may rather miss it .

Even George W. Bush ’s most ardent supporters conceded that his 2004 State of the Union address was , at best , uninspiring .
It was n’t just the president ’s bizarre inclusion of that most pressing of national problems , steroids in professional sports — a topic that received more presidential attention than the environment or energy policy .
Nor was it simply his ludicrous insistence that his tax cuts for the wealthy were creating jobs , or his gall in referring yet again to those nonexistent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
No , what was most sobering was how out of touch the president was with the problems that America now faces .
In our special report in this issue , we offer a different view of the state of the union .
And in a twist on Ronald Reagan ’s 1980 line , we pose the question , “ Who ’s Better Off ? ” Certainly not David Henning , a sophomore at Hillsboro High School outside Portland , Oregon .
Because of budget cuts , federal underfunding , and an anti-tax revolt led by a national conservative group , Oregon — once heralded for its first - rate schools — has been forced to lay off teachers and slash programs .
And at schools like Hillsboro High — as David Goodman reports ( “ Class Dismissed ” ) — this has forced as many as 51 kids to be crowded into a classroom .
Nor is Thomas Morgan , of Philadelphia , better off .
For nearly five years , Morgan has received dialysis treatment three days a week at his neighborhood hospital , MCP .
But now , as Arthur Allen explains ( “ Whose Hospital Is It ? ” ) , because of a combination of factors — including skyrocketing drug prices , more uninsured patients who ca n’t pay their bills , and the financial shenanigans of the for - profit corporation that owns it — MCP is scheduled to be shut down .
Yet some groups clearly are better off — federal contractors , for example .
In a probing report ( “ Contracts with America ” ) , our Washington correspondent Michael Scherer reveals how the government has contracted out so many of its basic functions that contractors have even taken over the job of overseeing and policing other contractors .
Scherer ’s article exposes a system that invites the kinds of outrageous abuses — by Halliburton and others — that have occurred in Iraq .
As Bill McKibben points out ( “ In Search of Common Ground ” ) , the nation has reached a point where so many of the challenges we face — from our failing education and health care systems , to the oursourcing of jobs overseas , to global warming — have begun to seem insurmountable .
They are not , of course .
We still have the capacity to over - come what McKibben calls our “ pervasive hyperindividualism ” and to rekindle a sense of the common good .
And in a year in which far more seems at stake than simply who should inhabit the White House , nothing could be more crucial than that .
— Roger Cohn
The Benq Joybee projector is something that you 're either going to think is silly or you 're going to fall in love with nearly instantly .
It 's a bunch of neat features balanced by one or two shortcomings , and the price tag — $ 500 — is an awkward straddling of price points for a piece of audio- visual equipment .
Is there a market for a " budget " projector that fits in the palm of your hand ?
Will people find a use for it ?
The answer to that question is largely personal , but after using the Joybee for a number of days , I have my verdict : I 'm in love .
Let 's get the stats out of the way .
The projector is tiny , weighing in at only 1.4 pounds .
The maximum resolution is 858X600 , but it 's able to scale anything you throw at it .
The projector can display in both 4:3 and 16:9 resolutions , and can also stretch a normal image to widescreen .
The bulb - less LED light is bright : 100 lumens , with a 2000:1 contrast ratio .
In a reasonably dark room we were able to get a perfectly viewable image , and even moderately light rooms will give you a good result .
While these stats may not blow your socks off in any other projector review , keep in mind this thing is tiny , measuring 5.4 by 4.7 by 2.1 inches .
The build quality is also impressive ; it feels like an actual projector , not a toy .
I did have a few rough moments trying to figure out how the buttons on the top of the unit worked ; they often would n't pick up the fact that I had hit them at all .
It 's not a touchpad , but it also does n't require a ton of pressure — it 's somewhere in between , and incredibly awkward .
Get ready to spend some time getting used to hitting them correctly .
The included remote is much better , although it 's laid out in a slightly goofy way and will also take time to get used to .
These are n't deal - breakers , but on a product that looks so elegant , they 're somewhat disappointing .
The breakout cable also adds some bulk and mess to the unit , and since the projector does n't use batteries , you 'll have to plug it in with an AC adaptor with quite the large power brick .
It 's not a big deal , but neither of these pieces of equipment ( both of which you 'll need to get the projector up and running ) fit into the included soft case .
You have two options for connections : you can either use a breakout cable to attach a composite or VGA source to the projector , or you can plug a USB 2.0 stick into the port in the back of the hardware .
That 's right , the projector will run a number of file types directly off a USB stick , including .avi , .mp4 , and .mov , not to mention plenty of image types .
I threw a number of video files I had on my computer at the projector , and they all played fine , with only one issue : the audio codec support was n't nearly as robust , and I could n't find a single file that would work with sound .
BenQ Joybee GP1 from Ars Technica on Vimeo .
That problem disappears when you hook an external source up to the projector , of course , but the hardware 's 2W built - in speaker did a fine , if slightly tinny , job in a medium sized room turned up 2/3 of the way .
Giving a micro projector to the site 's gaming expert to review lead to one thing : testing with video games first .
Let 's see how things held up .
Real - world use
While there may be some small niggles with the buttons or the remote or the cables , the Joybee projector delivers where it counts : in actual performance .
Even in a moderately light room , the picture is bright and clear .
If you 're projecting on a wall that is n't white , the software comes with a variety of color adjustment settings to make the picture look as close as possible to how it would look on a white screen .
The options are impressive .
Included on the hardware is a foot on the bottom that can be screwed in and out to tilt the projector up if you need to place it somewhere low , and there is a standard tripod connection on the bottom as well .
The software features automatic keystone correction , which means that even at a severe angle the projector will know what angle it's at and square the picture for you .
In testing , this feature worked perfectly , and using the built - in foot , keystone correction , and color correction with my wall I had a solid - looking image in under five minutes .
The biggest selling points of this projector are its portability and ease of use , and both aspects of the product live up to that promise .
AKW -Kühlkreislauf : Verstopfung stoppt Biblis B
Wegen ungelöster Probleme im AKW - Kühlkreislauf muss RWE seinen Altreaktor nachrüsten .
Minister Gabriel hatte zuvor vor der Inbetriebnahme gewarnt .
Die ungelösten Probleme im Kühlkreislauf von Atomkraftwerken haben Konsequenzen : Das AKW Biblis B , das nach einer sechsmonatigen Revision eigentlich an diesem Wochenende wieder hochgefahren werden sollte , darf vorerst nicht ans Netz gehen .
Das teilte das hessische Umweltministerium als zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde am Mittwoch mit .
Zunächst müssten die sogenannten Sumpfsiebe des Reaktors nachgerüstet werden .
Hintergrund sind Störfälle , bei denen nach einem Leck im Kühlkreislauf eines Reaktors losgelöste Fasern von Isoliermaterial Siebe verstopft hatten , was die Kühlung bedroht und somit zu einer Kernschmelze führen kann .
Zudem waren Isolierfasern in den Reaktorkern selbst eingedrungen .
Auch in jahrelangen Versuchen war es den Betreibern nicht gelungen , einen generellen Nachweis für die Beherrschbarkeit dieses Problem vorzulegen .
Darum muss nun in jedem Kraftwerk individuell nach einer Lösung gesucht werden .
Auch in Biblis ist das Problem noch nicht gelöst .
Das Bundesumweltministerium als übergeordnete Aufsichtsbehörde hatte deshalb in Hessen Druck gemacht .
Dort wollte man sich aber zunächst mit einer späteren Nachrüstung zufrieden geben .
Gabriel ging darum am Mittwoch in Berlin an die Öffentlichkeit .
RWE sollte " nicht den gleichen Fehler wie Vattenfall machen " , sagte er unter Anspielung auf das AKW Krümmel , in dem nach langem Stillstand unmittelbar eine schwere Panne aufgetreten war .
Auch an die hessische Regierung appellierte Gabriel : " Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen , dass die hessische Atomaufsicht die Verantwortung dafür übernehmen will , dass ein Jahr lang ein Kraftwerk betrieben wird , bei dem in einem nicht unerheblichen Teil der Sicherheitsanforderungen und Störfallnachweise der Stand von Sicherheit und Technik nicht gewährleistet wird . "
Falls dies nicht geschehe , wäre die " logische Konsequenz , dass wir uns diesen Fall als Bundesaufsicht anschauen " .
Wenige Stunden später reagierte das hessische Umweltministerium und erklärte , man habe " mit dem Betreiber RWE Power abgestimmt " , das Kraftwerk vor einem Anfahren nachzurüsten .
Ein Sprecher von RWE sagte der taz , die Nachrüstung , bei der andere
Siebe und ein Rückspülsystem installiert werden sollen , werde vermutlich " einige Wochen " in Anspruch nehmen .
Die Kosten seien noch nicht zu beziffern .
Grund für die Nachrüstung zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt sei nicht die öffentliche Debatte über die AKW - Sicherheit , sondern die schnellere Verfügbarkeit von notwendigen Komponenten .
Im Schwesterreaktor Biblis A , der derzeit wegen einer Revision ebenfalls vom Netz ist , droht das gleiche Problem .
Die beiden Reaktoren in Biblis , die zu den ältesten in Deutschland gehören , müssten laut Atomkonsens im nächsten Jahr stillgelegt werden .
Durch Stillstände verschiebt sich dieser Termin aber nach hinten .
Die Deutsche Umwelthilfe , die die Verstopfungsprobleme im Kühlwasserkreislauf Anfang Juli öffentlich gemacht hatte , begrüßte die Entscheidung zu Biblis B . " Wir freuen uns , dass die öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit zu einer Sensibilisierung geführt hat , die nun Konsequenzen hat " , sagte Geschäftsführer Rainer Baake .
Biblis dürfe aber kein Einzelfall bleiben .
" Wir fordern vergleichbar konsequentes Handeln für alle betroffenen Reaktoren . "
As if the stoners and dopers were n't paranoid enough , the police may soon be able to detect whether or not you partake in one the five most popular recreational drugs : cocaine , heroin , cannabis , amphetamine , and methamphetamine .
The device is intended for roadside use by law enforcement agencies and includes a disposable plastic cartridge and a handheld analyzer .
The cartridge has two components : a sample collector for gathering saliva and a measurement chamber containing magnetic nanoparticles .
The particles are coated with ligands that bind to one of five different drug groups .

After 90 seconds , the device delivers its verdict on a color - coded readout .
That 's a lot of fancy technology to tell you that the naked , toothless guy trying to escape from the ghosts chasing him is probably high as a kite , but Philips , the company behind the tester , hopes to have the device in Europe by the end of the year .
If it is successful , I would imagine that a US launch would not be far behind .

More U.N. repression in Haiti
Published Aug 23 , 2009 8:41 PM
After two days of a general strike , the people of Lascahobas , Haiti , held a peaceful rally Aug. 6 and set up blockades on the road to the Dominican Republic .
They were upset that , even though they had been without electricity for a few months , the Haitian electricity company , EDH , had decided to cannibalize their generator to repair the one in Mirebalais .
( Haïti- Liberté , Aug. 12-18 ) .
Lascahobas has just 7,500 people , according to the geography database Geonames .
It is located on Haiti ’s central plateau , about 70 miles northeast of Port - au - Prince , and is the administrative center for a larger region of about 135,000 people .
Its mayor , Gérard Joseph , told the Haitian press that Minustah , the U.N. ’s occupation force in Haiti , killed two protesters and injured six .
He said , “ I saw soldiers firing from an armored personnel carrier . ”
He urged human rights organizations and the Haitian authorities to investigate this situation .
While some of the figures varied slightly , all the Haitian press reported that there was a serious confrontation in Lascahobas .
For example , Radio Kontak
Inter reported that , in addition to Haitian police reports that two people were shot dead , seven more were injured , and two of them later died .
A number of Haitian sources report that one of the dead was a 7 - year - old child .
Minustah spokesperson Sophie Boutaud de Lacombe claimed that the Nepalese soldiers involved in the incident did not fire on the crowd , because it contained women and children , but she did admit that they fired in the air over protesters ’ heads .
( Radio Metropole )
One of the protesters , interviewed in the Zanmi Lasante hospital , stated : “ After I was shot in the arm , I could n’t keep on marching .
I was leaning against a car , when some Minustah soldiers came up and shot me in the other arm .
Then one of them kicked me . ” ( Haïti - Liberté , Aug. 12-18 )
The Haitian cops claimed that they did not participate in this confrontation in any fashion , but to avoid retaliation they withdrew to Mirebalais , about an hour away by car .
Minustah is in Haiti to protect the political and economic interests of the United States , along with those of Canada and France .
Instead of its proclaimed , lofty goals of “ peace and security leading to economic development , ” Minustah has brought Haiti terror , murder and heartache .
It is just an occupying power with blue helmets .
People who are fighting for health care reform should learn a lesson from their opponents and become less reality based .
To help this , I modestly propose ten talking points that show how health care reform can appeal to everyone , including conservatives , insurance companies , and even the media :
Health care reform will immensely help the conservative cause by showing Medicare , the Veterans Administration , the Postal Service , public highways , national parks , the military , police , and fire departments as the evil socialist monstrosities they truly are ; we will quickly abolish them all and revert to compassionate free market principles .
Who needs a military when wars can be treated as corporate takeovers ?
Who does n’t want to see Sarah Palin stand in front of a death panel ?
Even her most fervent supporters would enjoy giving her another outlet .
It would help the economy to euthanize all those non-productive old people .
It is their fault that health care costs are so high , anyway .
The money that the insurance and pharmaceutical industries are pumping into ads fighting health care reform is pretty much the only thing keeping most television stations afloat .
Without health care reform to endlessly vilify , the Fox News Channel ( if they even survive ) would probably be reduced to reruns of interviews with birthers .
Three words : “ Joe the Doctor ” .
Investor ’s Business Daily said that people such as scientist Stephen Hawking would n’t stand a chance under a nationalized health care system .
Heck , this is a guy who fifty years ago was diagnosed with a terminal disease and given three years to live , who has solved many challenging mysteries of the universe while not being able to speak , authored a dozen books and papers without being able to write , and has a wife and three children despite being completely paralyzed .
I ’m sure he ’s now bored and would welcome another challenge .
If our government is as corrupt and incompetent as conservatives want it to be , then any health care reform that makes it through Congress will turn out to be a big corporate give - away to the health insurance companies ( just like the Medicare prescription drug benefit that Dubya got passed ) .
So insurance companies will benefit !
Why should banks get all the rewards of government corruption and cronyism ?
The Liberty Counsel warns that the health reform bills in Congress will establish school - based ‘ health ’ clinics that will indoctrinate your children .
Have you tried to talk to any young people lately ?
I say they could definitely use some heavy - duty indoctrination !
Pro-life groups say that the health care bills will fund abortions .
Since a majority of Americans are pro-choice , this should be a big selling point .
I say this even though none of the current bills would actually fund any abortions .
After all , the pro-life crowd kept voting for neocons like Dubya , despite the fact that they never actually tried to outlaw abortions or did anything to reduce the number of abortions .
Just the hint that health reform will fund abortions should make it popular with the pro-choice majority .
Our friends at Liberty Counsel also claim that the health care bill will likely cover sex change surgery .
So even the LGBT crowd has something to like about reform .

Top 100 Forex Brokers by Popularity ( 1 - 50 )
The Popularity Rankings below are determined by a combination of the broker 's website popularity , both in terms of website traffic and links to the website from other places on the Internet , and the number of individual trader ratings .
We are not trying to determine the largest broker as in total trading volume but rather the broker that has the most interest to the greatest number of individual retail traders .
In other words , someone with a $ 50 account counts just as much as someone with $ 1,000,000 account .
In the future we hope to incorporate the actual number of individual retail accounts into the calculation when that information is available .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A model who was slammed with derogatory terms by an anonymous blogger has the right to learn the identity of her online heckler , a judge ruled .
Google complied with the court 's ruling , submitting the creator 's IP address and e-mail address .
In August 2008 , a user of Blogger.com , Google 's blogging service , created " Skanks in NYC , " a site that assailed Liskula Cohen , 37 , a Canadian - born onetime cover girl who has appeared in Vogue and other fashion magazines .
The blog featured photos of Cohen captioned with terms including " psychotic , " " ho , " and " skank . "
On Monday , New York Supreme Court Judge Joan Madden ruled that Google must hand over to Cohen any identifying information it possesses about the blog 's creator .
Steven Wagner , Cohen 's attorney , said Google complied with the ruling Tuesday evening , submitting to his legal team the creator 's IP address and e-mail address .
Only a valid e-mail address is required to register for a blog on Blogger.com .
Wagner said that once his legal team tracks the e-mail address to a name , the next step will be to sue Cohen 's detractor for defamation .
He said he suspected the creator of the blog is an acquaintance of Cohen .
The blog has not been operational for months .
Do n't Miss
The complaint
The unidentified creator of the blog was represented in court by an attorney , Anne Salisbury , who said her client voluntarily took the blog down when Cohen initiated legal action against it .
Salisbury suggested that Cohen is more interested in attracting publicity than restoring her reputation .
She contended her client 's blog would have languished harmlessly in obscurity had Cohen not filed suit .
The site had negligible traffic and only five posts on it , all written on a single day , she said .
In her ruling , the judge quoted a Virginia court that ruled in a similar case that nameless online taunters should be held accountable when their derision crosses a line .
" The protection of the right to communicate anonymously must be balanced against the need to assure that those persons who choose to abuse the opportunities presented by this medium can be made to answer for such transgressions , " the judge said , quoting the Virginia decision .
Cohen 's attorney said he was " happy that the court recognizes that the Internet is not a place where people can freely defame people . "
But the blogger 's attorney strongly disputed the judge 's reasoning .
Salisbury asserted that her client 's invective was not unusual for the Internet , and that hyperbolic online name - calling is so rampant -- " in comments sections , on Twitter , on blogs " as to practically be part of the Web's DNA .
She warned that Monday 's ruling has " potentially damaging implications for free speech on the Internet . "
After the ruling , a Google spokesman expressed sympathy for targets of Internet insult - slinging , but said the company divulges user information only when ordered to do so by a court .
" We sympathize with anyone who may be the victim of cyberbullying .
We also take great care to respect privacy concerns and will only provide information about a user in response to a subpoena or other court order , " Google 's Andrew Pederson said .

Comments : 2 class , 243 positive , 1753 negative instances .
total 228 features gaussian kernel .
Baseline systems : neural networks and Naive Bayes .
SVM outperformed them in terms of area under ROC curve , but most inportantly , in its ability to get very high true positives rate ( 50 % ) for very low false positives rate ( 0.5 % ) .
This performance would enable effective scan of exon databases in search for novel alternatively spliced exons , in the human or other genomes .

The Gaussian Dynamic Time Warping ( GDTW ) kernel for On-line Handwriting Recognition
During the last years the task of on - line handwriting recognition has gained an immense importance in all - day applications , mainly due to the increasing popularity of the personal digital assistant ( pda ) .
Currently a next generation of ``smart phones '' and tablet - style PCs , which also rely on handwriting input , is further targeting the consumer market .
However , in the majority of these devices the handwriting input method is still not satisfying .
In current pdas people still use input methods , which abstract from the natural writing style , e.g. in the widespread Graffiti .
Thus there is demand for a handwriting recognition system which is accurate , efficient and which can deal with the natural handwriting of a wide range of different writers .
Entered by : Claus Bahlmann < bahlmann@informatik.uni-freiburg.de > - Monday , September 09 , 2002 at 11:52:27 ( GMT )
Comments :
Usual SVM kernels are designed to deal with data of fixed dimension .
However , on - line handwriting data is not of a fixed dimension , but of a variable - length sequential form .
In this respect SVMs cannot be applied to HWR straightforwardly .
We have addressed this issue by developing an appropriate SVM kernel for sequential data , the Gaussian dynamic time warping ( GDTW ) kernel .
The basic idea of the GDTW kernel is , that instead of the squared Euclidean distance in the usual Gaussian kernel it uses the dynamic time warping distance .
In addition to on - line handwriting recognition the GDTW kernel can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems , where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure , e.g. speech recognition or genome processing .
Experiments have shown superior recognition rate in comparison to an HMM - based classifier for relative small training sets ( ~ 6000 ) and comparable rates for larger training sets .

Batman has been doing a good job of delivering what seems to be an adult experience in Teen - level ratings these days .
The Dark Knight was a sometimes - disturbing look into the world of Batman , with a now - iconic take on the sociopathic joker ... that came with a PG - 13 rating .
Batman : Arkham Asylum likewise delivers a brutal fighting system and mature themes in a game that comes complete with a Teen rating .
The demo for the title is out now — for the PS3 , Xbox 360 , and PC — and it 's pretty much your duty as a gamer to give it a go .
Batman has rarely been treated well in the gaming world , but Arkham Asylum strikes the player as a game that understands its characters .
The Joker is never really locked up in Arkham , not really .
It 's simply a place where he is able to safely plan and scheme ; what better place for the clown prince of crime than one where he is surrounded by his fellow criminals and mad men ?
Arkham Asylum points out that this is one of the few places that the Joker feels at home , and even in the introductory scenes Batman seems out of place and even somewhat awkward .
The point is made : Batman is comfortable stopping the Joker 's plots , but once he 's apprehended there is no clear idea of what to do with him .
The characters are ably voiced by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill , the men who brought both Batman and the Joker to life in the animated series , and the character design is a mix between what we 're used to in the comics and what we 've seen in the movies .
Arkham Asylum shows an incredible amount of confidence ; this is a game that is n't tied into any one version of the characters , but instead creates its own take .
One look at Killer Croc will let you know that there may be some surprises ahead .
We 've discussed the fighting system at length in the past , but in the context of the game itself , out of the Challenge Mode , it works just as well .
It 's not button - mashing , not exactly , but you 'll have to pay attention to context and spacing much more than which button lands what attack .
The demo gives you just enough time to try out the fighting , and then some of the swooping and hunting action , before booting you out .
It 's worth playing more than once simply to see more of the fighting animations — and they do look painful — or to take a few different approaches to hunting the Joker 's henchmen in the one room where you 're given more freedom to move .
There are some downsides to the demo .
The environment seems sterile and somewhat unconnected to the characters inside it ; there is very little environmental interaction other than the gargoyles that allow you to swing around near the ceiling .
The voice actor who plays Commissioner Gordon is passable at best , and the difficulty level is pretty light .
The camera can also be dizzying in places .
That being said , it does exactly what it 's supposed to do : introduce you to the game , get you comfortable with some of the mechanics , and leave you wanting more .
If you 're reading this from work , you now officially have something to look forward to when you get home .
Batman : Arkham Asylum is coming to the Xbox 360 and PS3 on August 25 , and the PC version will be released on September 18 .
We played the demo on the Xbox 360 .
Jerry Reinsdorf 's group has taken a big step forward in its bid to buy the Phoenix Coyotes .
As a result , Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie has suffered another setback .
The lawyer for SOF Investments , the biggest creditor owed money by the bankrupt NHL franchise , said Tuesday at a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix that SOF had reached an agreement in principle with Reinsdorf 's group .
SOF Investments previously threw its support behind Balsillie , the co-CEO of BlackBerry maker Research In Motion , who offered $ 212.5 million for the team on the condition that he can relocate it to Hamilton , but it appears SOF has flip - flopped .
Lawyer Steven Abramowitz announced the deal included a " substantial buydown " of the $ 80 million US that SOF is owed , with the rest of the money rolled over into debt .
Abramowitz asked the court to " do anything it can " to keep Reinsdorf 's bid afloat .
Reinsdorf is the majority owner of both baseball 's Chicago White Sox and basketball 's Chicago Bulls .
The relocation question Balsillie wants Judge Redfield T. Baum to set a deadline to determine the fee the NHL would charge to move the team to Hamilton .
But the NHL says that issue does n't matter because its owners have rejected Balsillie as a potential owner .
Baum said he wo n't act on the relocation issue until he rules on whether Balsillie can buy the team despite the NHL 's objections .
If the NHL loses that battle , lawyer Shep Goldfein said the league would immediately appeal the ruling .
This would open the possibility of a court - ordered stay of the sale .
Outside the courtroom , Abramowitz would n't say whether SOF still supported Balsillie 's offer as well .
Under Balsillie 's bid , SOF would get all $ 80 million it 's owed .
Balsillie 's representative , Richard Rodier , said the announcement from SOF came as a surprise .
" There 's surprises , there 's ups , there 's downs and you can't get too hyped up about the highs and you can't get too low about the lows , " Rodier said .
" You just work through the process . "
Baum , who scheduled Tuesday 's hearing to work out remaining issues in the case , set another hearing for Sept. 2 to work through other matters .
The biggest one on the table is whether the court should overrule the NHL owners ' rejection of Balsillie as a potential owner .
The NHL's board of governors rejected Balsillie 's bid by a 26 - 0 vote because they consider him untrustworthy .
Baum also ordered a stop to any attempt by Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes or Balsillie to get information from the applications of Reinsdorf 's group and Ice Edge , another potential buyer , from the NHL .
The pair wanted the confidential files to see whether Reinsdorf was treated differently in his application .
The Reinsdorf group 's lawyer , Alan Klein , said earlier in the hearing his clients were tired of the interfering as they worked out the details of their offer .
" I do n't know how long we 're going to be in here wasting time and money , " Klein said , adding that confidential information had already gone public due to Moyes ' lawyers , who apologized and said the leaked information was a mistake .
Following the hearing , NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said he understood where the Reinsdorf group was coming from .
" They feel that throughout this process , there have been a series of frustrating obstacles that have been placed in their way , roadblocks if you will , to try , they believe , to discourage their bidding , " Bettman said .
If Balsillie 's bid is successful , he wants to move the Coyotes immediately .
This is something the NHL says can't be done , and the league is looking for Baum to rule the team has to play in Arizona next season .
" We think that the sooner that the world knows that the Coyotes are going to be in Glendale next season , the easier it will be for the club to move forward , interact with its fans , sell tickets , make arrangements for the television broadcasts and the like , " Bettman said .
" As we 've repeatedly told the court , it is impossible to move this franchise for next season . "
The auction of the team is Sept. 10 , two days before the Coyotes open their training camp and five days before they play their first exhibition game .
The obstacles facing Reinsdorf 's group include persuading Baum that their $ 148 million bid — which is much smaller than Balsillie 's — is acceptable .
このニュースを見たときに、どこかで似た話を読んだ覚えがあったなぁと記憶を辿ったら、呉智英の「万引きテープと職業の貴賎」だった。
周辺情報を予め書いておくと、この文章は「月刊Be-Common」（日本放送出版教会）に1991-1992年に連載された時評コラム「シニカルな暴論」の一篇であり、『サルの正義』に収録されている。
「 万引きテープと職業の貴賎」は、1992年2月に、福島県いわき市の書店主が、横行する万引きに手を焼き、万引き犯人の映った監視カメラのビデオテープを「ザ・万引き」と銘打って販売したニュースに関するものである。
このビデオテープに中学生が5人映っているのを福島地方法務局が問題視し、販売中止を指導した……のだが、その後の雑誌記事によると書店主は今なお自信をもってテープを店頭に並べていたらしい。呉智英は以下のように書く。
いいねぇ。こういうの、私は好きだ。
まず第一に、言い分がもっともである。万引き程度だから真剣に謝れば許す。しかし、この中学生たちには悪びれた様子もない。自衛は当然だ、と言うのだ。
第二に、やり方が面白い。刑法上の容疑者や被告の顔がビデオにして公開したら人権問題になるだろうが、この犯人は実は法律的には犯人ではない。ただの人である。ただの人をビデオに撮って公開しても、それは七五三の風景や休日の歩行者天国を撮影してテレビ放映しているようなものだから、全然人権問題にはならないはずである。現在の人権論議が、犯人だから人権を守れという逆転した論理になっている状況がよく反映されている。もちろん、ただの人にも肖像権はあるから、彼らの側から民事訴訟を起こすことはできる。しかし、そのためには自分が万引き犯人であることを公表しなければならない。この店主、なかなかうまいところを突いたものだ。（引用者注：書籍では強調部分は傍点）
「 万引きテープと職業の貴賎」はこの後、この事件が期せずして「職業に貴賎はない」という公理に亀裂を入れかけていることを指摘し、「万引きテープを売っている書店主は、ちょうどこの人権思想の遵法闘争を展開しているのだ」と著者お得意の人権思想批判につながっていく。
呉智英はワタシ自身影響を受けた思想家で、『サルの正義』はその彼の著作でも一番好きなものだが、この「万引きテープと職業の貴賎」の後半部はちょっと強引に思えたし、今回再読してもやはりそうだった。
そのあたりは 「シニカルな暴論」ということでよいとして、岡山市北区のコンビニエンスストアの店主も、画像を店内に掲示するだけでなく万引きプロマイド（？）とでもいって売り物にしていたらどうだったろうか。
もっともこの記事を読む限り、万引き中学生の保護者は店主に謝罪する（子供に謝罪させる）どころか画像掲示に抗議したようで人権思想もへったくれもない感じではあるが。
If you ’ve already read the title , then you may have had the same expression as the picture above .
Two franchises from Sony Computer Entertainment , SOCOM and Syphon Filter , will be getting sequels on the PS3 , according to the PCB Production Credits page .
The page , in which you can view here , shows that SOCOM 4 and Syphon Filter 5 are currently in development .
SOCOM 4 has no developer listed , while Syphon Filter 5 shows the developer as Sony Bend .
The listings are shown below :
SOCOM 4 – ( motion capture direction ) – PLAYSTATION 3 ( in development )

Look at this crazy place I found in Shanghai !
This was inside one of the many government buildings .
It was a multi-story complex dedicated to the past , present , and future of Shanghai .
It was filled with multimedia presentations on the water systems , photo exhibits of the Bund under British control , and video extrapolations of what the city would become in 2020 .
Of all these cool things , the best was this gigantic model of Shanghai .
I walked around it about five times , trying to get some kind of sense of how to photograph the dang thing .
Then , finally , I decided to grab a shot that included a few tourists to show the scale of this monstrosity .
By the way , thanks so much for all the interest in the Newsletter yesterday !
I put a map on that page showing where all the early subscribers are coming from .
I was , frankly , surprised how many people signed up !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. consumer spending rose last month for the first time since February as government stimulus pushed incomes sharply higher , the Commerce Department said on Friday , supporting the view the economy was close to pulling out of recession .

Consumer spending , which accounts for over 70 percent of U.S. economic activity , rose 0.3 percent in May after an upwardly revised flat reading in April , the department said .
Mark Vitner , an economist with Wachovia in Charlotte , North Carolina , said that while consumer spending was likely to drop further for the second quarter as a whole , the data suggested it was on a better trajectory heading into the third quarter .
“ This confirms our forecast that the economy is going to move into positive territory in the third quarter , ” he said .
Personal income surged 1.4 percent last month from April as social benefit payments unleashed by the government ’s massive economic stimulus jumped .
April ’s income gain was revised upward to 0.7 percent from a previously reported gain of 0.5 percent .
The increase in spending was in line with analysts ’ forecasts , but economists had looked for only a 0.3 percent rise in income .
Still , the data had little impact on financial markets .
Inflation - adjusted , after - tax income jumped an even larger 1.6 percent in May , boosted both by tax cuts and payments under the $ 787 billion stimulus package .
Excluding the stimulus package , disposable income rose 0.2 percent , the department said .
The stimulus provided for one - time payments of $ 250 to people receiving Social Security , supplemental security income and other benefits .
While spending picked up , most of the stimulus money was socked away .
Savings jumped to a record annual rate of $ 768.8 billion , the highest level since records began in 1959 .
The saving rate climbed to 6.9 percent , the highest since December 1993 .
The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.1 percent .
A measure of inflation closely watched by the Federal Reserve , the year - on - year personal consumption expenditures index excluding food and energy rose 1.8 percent
You ’ve just finished your exams and it ’s time to hit the big time .
For three years your major in Philosophy has given you parties and lots of girls with glasses and a coffee habit .
But now you ’re graduating .
There ’s no job out there , and you kinda like the easy lifestyle so the best option is to go travelling to ‘ find yourself ’ or in other words , spend another year not doing much and burn out your parent ’s credit card .
But , as you ’ve spent the last three years with Michel de Montaigne , you do n’t know how to do this .
So , we ’ve put together a handy post to give all you students and grads out there a chance to travel the world and have an excellent time doing it .
Couchsurfing.org
Credit crunch got to your trust fund as well ?
No fear , hook up with this excellent community and stay on couch ’s through the world on your trip .
You ’ll meet lots of interesting people and you ’ll also get to see how people really live .
And it really saves on the bucks as well .
TripAdvisor
Even these days , the web is full of biased hotel reviews and destinations that are truly magical and amazing and are life changing .
You then find out the only magic about the hotel is the one that is holding it up or that the customers have not died of dysentery after two nights of their food .
Fortunately tripadvisor shows these problems with customer feedback reviews – what you really want .
DigiHitch
In the same way that couch surfing is for sleeping , digihitch is for hitchhiking .
I know what you ’re thinking : horror movie – stabbed in the outback and left for dead – but there is a whole community out there dedicated to hitch hiking – if this does n’t make you feel safe , then you might as well stay in the basement !
Global Freeloaders
While the term ‘ freeloader ’ is defined as someone who takes advantage of the charity of others , this website has a way of bringing them together .
The site is an online community of people offering free accommodations .
Expedia.co.uk
Like Tripadvisor , but European in outlook – you gonna want to go to Europe , right ?
With excellent hotel reviews and the added bonus of you being able to search for a car , hotel and flight together ( well , if you ’ve got loads of money and have n’t burnt out the credit card yet ! ) .
Apple.com
Travelling on the whole is boring .
Getting there is the fun bit .
The bit in - between is dull with long periods of sitting down and dozing – actually a perfect way to train you for an office job – but in the meantime you need some fun in your life .

Amazon Kindle Store
Do n’t lug all your books around the world – that mean that you ’ll only be able to wear one pair of underwear through the whole trip .
A kindle , with connection to their store means you can read a whole library on your techhie wonder all in a rather grey and rather lacklustre design .
But it ’s worth the 15 days working in the cracker factory with Jose .
Hostels.com
Youth Hostels are a great place to hang out in .
But be aware !
You want to go to the recognised hostels , not just any old thing .
This site tells you all about the right ones – and there ’s a great forum added in to boot .

It ’s not just a place for people to tell you they ’ve just gone to the Washroom – it ’s a way you can keep family and friends up to date with where you are and what ’s going on .
Oh , and what the washrooms are like in Vietnam .
Having had a night to sleep on it – and sleep very soundly – I ’m much closer to what I said was the downside possibility for the President : not just a missed opportunity but a self - immolation .
This was truly the worst of Trump : racist , belligerent , angry , unstable .
I ’ll give the man his due .
Trump can be if not funny then jocular , entertaining in a predatory , roguish way .
Last night had none of that .
It was pure id and an id under threat .
Beyond all the individual offenses one of the underrated sub - themes of anti-Trumpism is exhaustion .
One of the deepest traumas of living in the home of an abuser stems not from the outbursts of physical violence , verbal abuse or manipulation but the accumulated stress of ambient tension , uncertainty , the reflexive , unshakeable hyper-vigilance .
It is exhausting in a profound way .
Trump is exhausting – I suspect even for some who share his dark values .
This was 90 minutes jam - packed with everything that makes Trump exhausting .
Living with an abuser means being trapped in close quarters with the abuse , being unable to run .
In a month voters get the chance to walk away .
How much of a hub is it ?
Well so much so that Deb Bryant Public Sector Communities Manager at the OSU OSL has just been named to the Open Source for America steering committee .
While I like to wax on about Portland being the de facto hub of open source , truth of the matter is that — just to the south of us — there ’s a literal hub for open source : the Oregon State University Open Source Lab .
How much of a hub is it ?
Well so much so that Deb Bryant , Public Sector Communities Manager at the OSU OSL , has just been named to the Open Source for America steering committee .
What exactly is Open Source for America ?
Aside from being a who ’s who of open source advocates , it has the hopes of changing the way government works with open source .
Open Source for America ( OSA ) is an effort to raise awareness in the U.S. Federal Government about the benefits of open source software .
We hope to encourage the government ’s utilization of open source software participation in open source software projects , and incorporation of open source community dynamics to enable transparency .
And those thought leaders will be needed .
That ’s for sure .
The entrenched lobbying parties will likely be none too happy to see others recommend that their economic interests be divested in favor of open source pursuits .
As Dana Oshiro at ReadWriteWeb writes :
Nevertheless , lobbying will be no easy feat as smaller open source companies will have to jockey for position against Microsoft during requests for proposals .
Furthermore , in the past government officials have expressed security concerns with open source code .
Critics argue that exposed source code can be examined by attackers and therefore poses a risk .
Nevertheless , another argument for exposed code can be made in ensuring security .
By moving away from proprietary software models and giving free access to a system ’s source code , governments are no longer dependent on a select few contractors for their defense .
Instead , an entire programming community can be deployed to defend against attacks .
Luckily for the OSA , this is oft - trodden ground for Bryant who has long been a leading proponent for government and open source .
She ’s perhaps best known for being the driving force behind GOSCON , the premier government open source convention .
But that ’s not all .

My boyfriend of eight months is 38 , with two kids .
I 'm 27 and divorced .
He has unofficially moved into my apartment , but he is n't pulling his weight .
He pays $ 500 a month in child support and $ 400 for his apartment -- that he does n't live in .
( All of his utilities were shut off for nonpayment . )
I understand that he does n't have money to throw around , and help him financially whenever he needs it .
He 's always grateful , but I 'm feeling resentful because he 's very irresponsible in his spending ( he lacks self - control ) .
I could 've amassed an emergency fund or bought the motorcycle I promised myself after my divorce .
Now , that 's been put off .
He threw me a few bucks for expenses when I asked , but only twice .
I told him he has until August 1 to ditch his apartment so he 'll have some money .
He does say he loves me every day , tells me I 'm beautiful , and says I make him happier than he 's ever been .
I 'm at a loss .
How do I kindly tell him to pull it together ?
-- Tapped Out
You dreamed of the wind on your face and the sun at your back as you 're speeding down the open road on a new Harley .
You settled for a Hog parked in your living room , mowing through your groceries and mining the couch crevices for spare change .
Not surprisingly , the guy is n't saying , " Gimme all your money , and make sure there 's no dye pack in there . "
He tells you he loves you , how happy you make him , how beautiful you are .
( He finds you especially beautiful as you 're writing the check to pay his electric bill . )
It would be one thing if he'd fallen on hard times , but he 's impulsive and fiscally irresponsible .
As unromantic as it is to care about money , what 's even more unromantic is fighting bitterly about it , which is what you 'll be doing , and in close quarters , if Mr. Moochypants gives up his place and moves in for good .
And , no , the problem is n't how to " kindly " tell him to get it together ; this is a character issue .
This is who he is -- a 38 - year - old man who can't live within his means , but has no qualms about living within yours .
You do n't have to find a rich guy with a bum ticker , just a nice , stable guy who brings more to the party than a variety of flattering remarks about your hair .
After all , you pull your weight .
Do n't you think you deserve a man who does the same ?
Also , because women evolved to seek providers , men co-evolved to become somebody and acquire resources , probably as a way of getting chicks .
A guy might tell you he has no problem being supported by you , but he 's sure to devalue you for it -- his genes make him do it .
( Sadly , they have yet to enroll in " Intro to Women 's Studies . " )
You might care about your boyfriend , but your willingness to stay with an unrepentant sponge suggests you do n't expect much for yourself .
Good news !
You can change that .
Work on becoming a person who has a strong sense of self - worth -- strong enough to set standards for who she lets into her life .
You 're sure to pick a different sort of guy once it's you who 's looking for a boyfriend , not your unresolved issues .
Should you have a moment of weakness , just remind yourself of all the things you have to offer a guy -- beyond lights , running water , and a telephone with a dial tone .

The world 's largest oil company is continuing to fund lobby groups that question the reality of global warming , despite a public pledge to cut support for such climate change denial , a new analysis shows .
Company records show that ExxonMobil handed over hundreds of thousands of pounds to such lobby groups in 2008 .
These include the National Center for Policy Analysis ( NCPA ) in Dallas , Texas , which received $ 75,000 ( £ 45,500 ) , and the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC , which received $ 50,000 .
According to Bob Ward , policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment , at the London School of Economics , both the NCPA and the Heritage Foundation have published " misleading and inaccurate information about climate change . "
On its website , the NCPA says : " NCPA scholars believe that while the causes and consequences of the earth 's current warming trend is [ sic ] still unknown , the cost of actions to substantially reduce CO2 emissions would be quite high and result in economic decline , accelerated environmental destruction , and do little or nothing to prevent global warming regardless of its cause . "
The Heritage Foundation published a " web memo " in December that said : " Growing scientific evidence casts doubt on whether global warming constitutes a threat , including the fact that 2008 is about to go into the books as a cooler year than 2007 " .
Scientists , including those at the UK Met Office say that the apparent cooling is down to natural changes and does not alter the long - term warming trend .
In its 2008 corporate citizenship report , published last year , ExxonMobil said it would cut funds to several groups that " divert attention " from the need to find new sources of clean energy .
The NCPA and Heritage Foundation are included among groups funded by ExxonMobil , according to details of its " 2008 Worldwide Contributions and Community Investments " published recently .
Ward said : " ExxonMobil has been briefing journalists for three years that they were going to stop funding these groups .
The reality is that they are still doing it .
If the world 's largest oil company wants to fund climate change denial then it should be upfront about it , and not tell people it has stopped . "
In 2006 , Ward , then at the Royal Society , wrote to ExxonMobil to challenge the company 's funding of such lobby groups .
The move , revealed in the Guardian , prompted accusations of censorship and debate about whether experts should " police " the distribution of scientific information .
In an article on the Guardian website , Ward writes : " I have now written again to ExxonMobil to point out that these organisations publish misleading information about climate change on their websites , and to seek guidance on how to reconcile this fact with the pledge made by the company .
I believe that the company should keep its promise by ending its financial support for lobby groups that mislead the public about climate change . "
ExxonMobil said it annually reviews and adjusts its contributions to policy research groups .
A spokesman said : " Only ExxonMobil speaks for ExxonMobil and our position on climate change is clear .
We have the same concerns as people everywhere , and that is how to provide the world with the energy it needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
We take the issue of climate change seriously and the risks warrant action . "

What Is Fluoride
Research
Thoughts
Leave a Comment and Tell Us Your Opinion on Fluoride ?
( OrganicJar )
Well , in case you did n't know it , fluoride is highly toxic .
In fact , before fluoride was deemed a " cavity fighter , " it was used as insecticide and rat poison .
It 's true .
Even more surprising is that when it comes to dental hygiene , fluoride actually does more harm than good .
Fluoride appears to have the potential to initiate or promote cancers , particularly of the bone , according to the most recent and extensive review of fluoride toxicology by the prestigious National Research Council ( NRC ) .
Fluoride chemicals are added to about 70 % of public water supplies ostensibly to reduce tooth decay , not to purify the water .
The NRC found The Environmental Protection Agency 's Maximum Contaminant Level Goal ( MCLG ) for fluoride is too high to be protective of health ( 4 mg/ L ) and must be lowered .
EPA scientists have been saying this since 1986 ; but EPA management caved to political pressure and over - ruled its scientists
There ’s loads of evidence linking fluoride to adverse health effects - even at low doses added to public and some bottled water supplies ( See link )
At least three members of the NRC fluoride panel believe the MCLG for fluoride should be zero .
Fluoride is a pollutant - a by - product of copper , iron and aluminum manufacturing .
The problem of how to legally dispose of fluoride was solved in the 1930's when a study ( funded by one of the country 's largest aluminum companies ) concluded that fluoride prevented tooth decay .
A successful public relations effort , helped along with some cooperative government cronies , resulted in the good news going out : this miracle chemical , when added to water supplies , will give everyone healthy teeth and brighter smiles .
The NRC study found that the high levels of bone fluoride and the similarity of the mechanisms of action between fluoride - induced DNA damage and chemically - induced p53 mutations lead us to believe that high fluoride bone content might be one of the major factors causing osteosarcoma ( bone cancer ) .
Mutations in the p53 genes are the most commonly observed genetic alterations in human cancer .
Ramesh concludes that fluoride probably causes mutations in p53 .
In 1990 a National Toxicology Program ( NTP ) study determined fluoride could be a cancer - causing agent .
The NTP study " supplied a detailed description of the toxicology of fluoride , not only in terms of osteosarcoma , but also lesions in the oral mucosa , thyroid gland , skin and uterus ... ( which ) prompted us to re-test the hypothesis of an epidemiological association between water fluoridation and cancer incidences ... " , wrote Takahashi who found fluoridation status positively correlates to cancers of the oral cavity , pharynx , colon , rectum , hepato - bilary & urinary organs and bone cancer .
Let 's be perfectly clear : Fluoride is not something your body needs .
No one has a fluoride deficiency .
Fluoride is a false magic bullet solution from a bygone era .
Now , 60 years after water fluoridation began , the word is getting out , that this stuff is just plain bad .
Take action to end fluoridation here .

They do not break ( shatter ) laminated saftley glass like windshields , I think you mean tempered safety glass as used in doors .
It has to do with hardness .
Glass is actually " harder " than iron on the Mohs scale , and spark plug ceramic ( technically called " aluminum oxide ceramic " ) is much harder than glass .
Aluminium oxide ceramic actually rates a 9 on the Mohs scale ; diamonds are 10 , glass is 6.5 , and iron is 4.5 .
That 's the key to the whole thing , and why it 's surprisingly hard to break a window with a hammer and surprisingly easy to break it with a small , light little shard of innocent white spark plug ceramic .
( via http://www.ridelust.com/obscure-burglary-tools-of-the-day-ninja-rocks/)
Other answers ( not accurate , read comments below ) include :
- A spark plug is heavy this would be no mystery but if you mean how does the ceramic from a sparkplug break safety glass than your question will be answered .
- The ceramic from a sparkplug attracts negative electrons ( Negative Static ) A cars side or rear window ( Tempered Glass ie safety glass ) has positive electrons ( Positive Static )
If one were to throw a peice of sparkplug ceramic at a car window the first part of the ceramic that touches the window creates a miner spark explosion which temporarly weakens the glass to an extreme point than the rest of the weight of the ceramic breaks the glass .
- You can shatter a car window with a piece of ceramic from a sparkplug about the size of your pinky finger nail .
- Last I checked , POSITIVE electrons are positrons , a component of antimatter ... rather overkill to cause a nuclear event just to break a window .
Rethink your physics .--- Although the answer is not correct ... a positive electron can also be considered a hole , or rather a lack of an electron ... not necessarily your exotic anitimatter .
I really do n't care for the new look , but I 'm still on board .
I wish they had just redrawn it like the art in Monkey Island 3 ; I loved that one !
I hope the new episodic adventure does n't use this art style too .

Description
The Houston toad is 2 to 3.5 inches long .
Its general coloration varies from light brown to gray or purplish gray , sometimes with green patches .
The pale undersides often have small , dark spots .
Males have a dark throat , which appears bluish when distended .
Life History
The Houston toad lives primarily on land .
These toads are considered habitat specialists , requiring very specific environmental conditions to survive .
They aestivate ( a dormant period during hot , dry conditions similar to hibernation during cold conditions ) during most of the year , burrowing into the sand for protection .
Habitat preferences include forested areas with loblolly pine , post oak , bluejack or sandjack oak , yaupon , and little bluestem .
For breeding , including egg and tadpole development , Houston toads require shallow ponds or temporary water sources that persist for at least 30 days .
These water sources may include ephemeral ( temporary ) rain pools , flooded fields , blocked drainages or depressions that hold water , wet areas associated with seeps or springs , or more permanent ponds containing shallow water .
The toads do best in ponds without predatory fish .
The Houston toad is a year - round resident where found , although its presence can most easily be detected during the breeding season , when males may be heard calling .
Males usually call in or near shallow water or from small mounds of soil or grass surrounded by water .
Males occasionally call from wooded habitat located within about a 100 - yard radius of breeding ponds .
The call is a high clear trill that lasts from 20 - 30 seconds
The call is much like that of the American toad ( Anaxyrus americanus ) , but usually slightly higher in pitch .
The American toad occurs in Texas , but north of the range of the Houston toad .
Houston toads may call from December through June .
Most breeding activity takes place between January and mid-May on warmer , humid evenings ( often preceded by a cold - front ) .
Groups of calling males draw females to the breeding pond with high , clear trills .
Females , responding to groups of calling males , move toward the water to mate .
Houston toads are considered explosive breeders , in that they tend to breed all at once for short periods of time during the breeding season .
The female lays her eggs as long strings in the water , where they are fertilized by the male as they are laid .
The eggs hatch within 48 hours , and tadpoles live in the pond from 2.5 to 7 weeks , depending on the water temperature and food availability .
Once metamorphosis is complete , the emerging new toads ( toadlets ) are about one - half inch long and tend to stay within 3 to 5 meters ( 10 to 16 feet ) of the pond for about 3 weeks until they begin to disperse along drainages into upland forest .
Juvenile Houston toads have been found to remain within a 50 - meter radius of the pond they emerged from for at least 13 weeks .
Once they disperse from the pond , they spend their time feeding and growing in preparation for the next breeding season .
Males generally breed when they are a year old , but females may not breed until they are two years old .
Houston toads , especially first - year toadlets and juveniles , are active year round under suitable temperature and moisture conditions .
Their diet consists mainly of insects and other invertebrates .
It is believed the average lifespan in the wild is 2 to 3 years .
Habitat
The Houston toad requires loose , deep sands supporting Loblolly pine forest , or mixed post oak - woodland savannah with 60 - 80 % canopy cover and an open understory that supports native bunch grasses and still or flowing waters for breeding .
Distribution

Threats and Reasons for Decline
Habitat loss and alteration are the most serious threats facing the Houston toad .
Conversion of forested land for agricultural and urbanization have reduced the wooded and wetland areas that support the Houston toad .
Converting ephemeral wetlands to permanent ponds also can contribute to further decline of Houston toad populations by spreading out the calling males .
Conversion to permanent water not only makes them more vulnerable to predation by snakes , fish , and other predators ; but also increases competition and hybridization with closely related species and more ponds on the landscape spreads out the calling males , reducing their ability to attract females to breed .
Periodic drought is also a threat , particularly long - term drought such as that experienced during the 1950's .
Drought may result in the loss or reduction of breeding sites , enhance mortality of toadlets and adults , and lead to catastrophic , landscape - altering wildfires .
Clear cutting of forest that reduces canopy cover near breeding ponds and on the uplands adjacent to these ponds reduces the quality of breeding , foraging , distribution and resting habitat , and increases the chances of predation and hybridization .
Conversion of native grassland and woodland savannah to sod-forming introduced grasses , such as bermudagrass and bahiagrass , eliminates habitat because grass growth is generally too dense for the toad to move freely .
Dense sod also inhibits burrowing .
High traffic roads are a barrier to Houston toad movement , and toads are sometimes killed on roads .
Other linear features such as pipelines and transmission lines can create barriers between foraging , hibernating , and breeding sites , especially if native vegetation has been removed .
Continuous grazing ( not rotating cattle ) , heavy stocking rates , and long term fire suppression have caused loss of habitat in a significant part of the toad 's range .
Historically , periodic fire played an important role in maintaining native bunchgrass communities in loblolly pine and post oak savannah .
Due to poor grazing management practices and fire suppression since the arrival of European man , much of the former savannah grasslands of the Post Oak region has grown into brush thickets devoid of herbaceous vegetation .
Houston Toads need the herbaceous layer of bunchgrasses and wildflowers / herbs for cover and foraging habitat .
Additionally , unmanaged forested areas and prolonged periods of fire suppression result in dense overgrowth of shrubs .
Dense forest understory ( shrub growth ) results in less diverse herbaceous ground cover ( grasses and herbs / wildflowers ) and reduces insect diversity and abundance ( toad food ) .
Heavy fuel loads associated with dense forest understories lead to catastrophic , stand - altering wildfires , similar to the Bastrop County Complex Fires in 2011 .
The invasion of the red imported fire ant also has an impact on the long - term survival of the Houston toad .
These toads occur in small , scattered populations , and may be more seriously affected by fire ants than species that are more common and widespread .
Fire ants kill young toadlets ( less than 7 - 10 days old ) moving out of the breeding pond into the surrounding land habitat .
Research shows that fire ants also may reduce insect diversity and abundance , and thus may also limit the toad 's food supply .
Amphibians in general are very sensitive to many pollutants , including pesticides and other organic compounds .
These chemicals may affect the toad directly , particularly in the tadpole stage , or indirectly by lowering the abundance and diversity of its food supply .
Widespread use of pesticides and herbicides from about 1950 to 1975 may also have contributed to declining populations .
During this period , DDT and similar non-specific chemicals accumulated in the environment , affecting a wide variety of animal life .
Although threats from persistent , non-specific chemicals are not as serious today as in the past , the use of pesticides and herbicides for agricultural and residential purposes may still pose a danger for the Houston toad , but can be used successfully with guidance to reduce harm to the toad .
Although Houston toad populations are inherently separated because they exist only in areas of deep sandy soil , further fragmentation of habitat due to human activity can exaggerate the problem .
Widely scattered parcels of habitat may not easily be re-colonized by distant Houston toads if extensive areas of unsuitable habitat occur between populations , or when human impacts eliminate a population .
Ongoing Recovery
Research on the life history , habitat requirements , and best management practices for the Houston Toad continues .
Population surveys are conducted in areas where toads have been found and in potential habitat areas .
Efforts to provide information and educational opportunities to the general public and landowners regarding life history and habitat requirements of the toad are a vital part of the recovery process .
There are also several tools available to contribute to the recovery of Houston toad populations available to landowners including Habitat Conservation Plans and a programmatic , range - wide Safe Harbor Agreement for the Houston toad .
How You Can Help
( Rachel Maddow discussed the astroturfing a - holes going to the August town halls . )
You can always count on the media and the wingnutosphere to be hypocrites whenever any sort of protest takes place .
For Republicans , they usually have to pay for their Zombie Plumbers to show up which is called : Astroturfing .
Astroturf refers to apparently grassroots - based citizen groups or coalitions that are primarily conceived , created and / or funded by corporations , industry trade associations , political interests or public relations firms .
No , it 's not the fake grass that was used in baseball and football stadiums , but big cash being paid by corporations to promote conservative philosophy and undermine real change .
Matt Yglesias writes : Astroturf vs “ AstroTurf ” .
Read it .
The Malkins of course just love Astroturfing and probably view it as just another tool conservatives have to lie and cheat their way through another tough issue .
And the media wittingly comply with their wishes .
Think Progress has a whole list of these lobbyist / corporate shills .
Even Newt Gingrich is supplying a toolkit for the teabaggers to use to disrupt health care town halls .
Thers at Whiskey Fire explains :
Which brings us to today , where by the miracle of wingnut headcase engineering , the Moral Wall Switch for coordinated attempts to disrupt other people 's public events has been hastily and incompetently flipped from Evil to Good .
To wit , here 's the Tea Party - associated Freedom Works offering advice to Tea -Baggers about how best to disrupt town - hall meetings held by elected Democratic officials who want to discuss healthcare with their constituents : – Be Disruptive Early And Often : “ You need to rock - the - boat early in the Rep ’s presentation , Watch for an opportunity to yell out and challenge the Rep ’s statements early . ” – Try To “ Rattle Him , ” Not Have An Intelligent Debate :
The goal is to rattle him , get him off his prepared script and agenda .
If he says something outrageous , stand up and shout out and sit right back down .
Look for these opportunities before he even takes questions . ”
Unsurprisingly , this is precisely what the Tea -Baggers have been doing .
( Check out the video especially . )
And what has been the reaction from those who invented imaginary liberal behavior and are watching as their side actually does precisely the stuff they only pretended liberals were doing and which they denounced as Wicked , Deranged , and Perfidious ?
Cheering it on , of course .
Duh .
How long will it take the traditional media to expose the corporations that are running this con and even mention the word " astrotufing " in a serious way ?
I know , do n't hold your breath .
UPDATE : It 's taking Robert Gibbs to try and wake up the media from their slumber over these events :
We have Robert Gibbs openly calling this the Brooks Brothers Brigade .
That 's a start .
Q : Are you concerned at what appears to be well - orchestrated protesting of health care reform at town halls as derailing your message ?
GIBBS : NO , I get asked every day about the myriad of things that could be derailing our message .
I would point out that I do n't know what all those guys were doing , what were they called , the Brooks Brothers Brigade in Florida in 2000 , appear to have rented a similar bus and are appearing together at town hall meetings throughout the country Q :
They seem to be pretty widespread .
GIBBS : I seem to see some commonality in who pops up in some of these things .
Q : Like individuals ?
GIBBS : Yeah .
Q : Really ?
GIBBS : Yeah .
Q : Can you discuss names or ....
GIBBS : I do n't have names but I think you can see quite a bit of similarity between who shows up where .
He 's clearly trying to lead the horses of the press corps to water , not that they 'll drink .
I heard some Villager on TV say that Gibbs is making a mistake because he is only making Matt Drudge 's website bigger .
Really , I thought he already ruled their world .

Impact of COVID -19
Elections Canada has been closely monitoring the COVID - 19 outbreak and its impact .
As part of its ongoing readiness planning , the agency is working on a new operational approach to deliver an election in the context of a pandemic and post - pandemic .
The health and safety of electors and the thousands of election workers who make a general election possible will always be a priority .
As a result , Elections Canada is currently analyzing which measures should be put in place for the next general election .
Working group
The agency has set up an internal working group to lead its planning effort .
Among other things , the group is looking at :
Procedures and possible physical distancing measures that could be put in place at polling stations and Elections Canada offices .
The capacity of Elections Canada 's existing vote - by - mail system .
How to recruit , train , and keep election workers safe .
Confirming the availability and capacity of its many suppliers of goods and services before and during elections .
Reviewing polling station requirements and identifying alternative options for locations that may become unavailable due to COVID - 19 concerns .
The working group will consider potential legal , administrative and operational changes in order to deliver an accessible and safe election chaturbate .
Impact of COVID - 19 on the ways to vote
The Canada Elections
Act contemplates elections where electors are offered a range of voting options , including voting on election day or at an advance poll , and voting by mail or at an Elections Canada office .
Elections Canada is assessing the capacity of its vote - by - mail system to handle a much larger number of electors .
However , a viable election where all electors vote by mail would require fundamental changes to the Canada Elections Act .
While not excluding adaptations to the Act , the agency 's current efforts are focused on assessing its ability to adapt its approach within the general parameters of the existing regime .
Any election in this context will likely involve a combination of adjustments to voting services , including more electors voting by pornhub , among other measures .
Could an election be held if there are still public health concerns ?
Elections Canada does not set the date for a general election .
The Canada Elections
Act provides for a general election to be held on fixed dates , though given the current minority government situation , an election could take place at any time .
Elections Canada is currently evaluating a wide range of scenarios to determine how it can adapt its operations in the context of a pandemic or post - pandemic while maintaining an accessible like xhamster , safe and healthy environment for electors and workers , especially for older Canadians .
In an extreme case , based on the advice of public health experts , the Chief Electoral Officer could certify that it has become impracticable for Elections Canada to administer the election in one or several electoral districts and recommend to the governor - in - council that the election writ be withdrawn .
This has never been done in Elections Canada 's history .
Communicating with Canadians
Elections Canada understands that the situation related to the COVID - 19 outbreak is fluid and can evolve quickly .
We are committed to communicating regularly and clearly with Canadians about the measures we are taking to prepare for a general election in what may be a challenging environment .
We will inform Canadians if and when we bring in changes to the procedures used during the most recent general election .
We will do so using our website ( www.agentporntube.com), social media channels , and election advertising .

Filing deadlines for political entities during the COVID - 19 pandemic
Elections Canada understands that candidates , registered parties , electoral district associations , third parties and other regulated political entities may be experiencing challenges during the COVID - 19 pandemic .
We have implemented a number of measures focused on providing as much flexibility as possible to allow political entities every opportunity to be in compliance with their financial reporting obligations under the Canada Elections Act .

Alex Bennee mentions the excellent longlines - mode in a recent post .
I learnt something new – that it can highlight hard returns using ( longlines - show - hard - newlines ) .
Thanks Alex .
What is so good about it when you can wrap a paragraph at any time using M-q ( fill - paragraph ) ?
It wraps a paragraph in realtime as you are editing it , just like a word processor .
And not only that , it uses soft newlines .
If you cut and paste it , the result is not wrapped which is generally what you want .
I use longlines - mode a lot when I ’m not editing source code .

What I ’ve got here is going to be really valuable to you if you want to whiten your teeth but do n’t want to go to the trouble of making a
dentist appointment and paying them $ 200 or more : this girl in the video below worked as an assistant in a dentist ’s office for several months and figured out a way to do the exact same procedure they charged several hundred dollars for at home for less than ten bucks , I ’m not
kidding –the key is that the chemicals they use are available over - the - counter in the U.S. , and that plus a sneaky little trick to making the molds the dentist uses out of plastic mouth guards usually used by football players and voila : professional quality white - ‘n - shiny teeth 😀 .
Have a look :
Ok , a couple of things : you might get a bit of sensitivity , like she said , and if so just quit for a couple of days and then come back to it .
What ’s happening is that the peroxide is temporarily inflaming the nerve of
the tooth , and as soon as you stop using it then the sensitivity should quickly subside , plus you build up a tolerance to it so it eventually goes away on it ’s own if you keep using the whitener .
Also : this method of whitening works better on younger people than older , and better on yellow stains
than brown or grey–peroxide is specifically designed for , and great at , clearing up stains caused by food , coffee , wine , and tobacco .
Certain antibiotics such as tetracycline can cause your teeth to stain , peroxide will not help with this ( sorry , you ’ll need to go see the dentist , they do have ways of dealing with this ) .
Also , if the peroxide comes into contact with your gums or skin while you ’re handling it then it can temporarily bleach them white – do n’t worry , this is a very mild and temporary chemical burn , it ’ll go away of its own accord .

Keeping up with the latest slang is at once easier and harder than ever .
The number of slang dictionaries is growing , both online and off , not to mention social networking media that invent and discard words , phrases and memes at the speed of broadband .
The life of slang is now shorter than ever , say linguists , and what was once a reliable code for identifying members of an in - group or subculture is losing some of its magic .
The Internet “ is robbing slang of a lot of its sociolinguistic exclusionary power , ” said Robert A. Leonard , a linguistics professor at Hofstra in Hempstead , N.Y. , whose slang credentials include being a founding member of the doo - wop group Sha Na Na , formed in the late 1960s .
“ If you are in a real inside group , you are manufacturing slang so that you can exclude the wannabes . ”
And that becomes harder , he added , as the whole world has access to your language .
Part of the problem is that electronic media are making it too easy to compile dictionaries like “ U.C.L.A . Slang 6 . ” While slang dictionaries have been around in one form or another since the 18th century , they now number more than a dozen in print , to say nothing of online resources like UrbanDictionary.com and slangsite.com that are updated hundreds of times daily .
“ It used to be that the guys who did all the slang dictionaries would take years just to track it down , ” said David Crystal , a linguist who has written more than 30 books .
“ Now , with the Internet , you just put something up on Facebook and say ‘ send me in your slang terms , ’ and in a few days you have hundreds of examples and the ability to check it out with other readers . ”
Urban Dictionary , which is 10 years old , may be the ultimate example .
It is a sprawling , chaotic collection of street talk , all of it user - submitted , giving everyone access to the meaning behind the coded lyrics of someone like Lil Wayne .
Microsoft today announced that Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 have hit the Release to Manufacturing ( RTM ) milestone .
The software giant still has a lot of work to do , but the bigger responsibility now falls to OEMs that must get PCs ready , Independent Software Vendors ( ISVs ) that are testing their new apps , and Independent Hardware Vendors ( IHVs ) that are preparing their new hardware .
The RTM build is 7600 , but it is not the same one that leaked less than two weeks ago ( 7600.16384 ) .
We speculated that Microsoft may end up recompiling build 7600 until it is satisfied , but it only took the company one more shot to get it right : 7600.16385 is the final build number .
Microsoft refused to share the full build string , but if you trust leaks from a few days ago , it 's " 6.1.7600.16385.090713-1255 , " which indicates that the final build was compiled over a week ago : July 13 , 2009 , at 12:55 pm .
This would be in line with the rumored RTM date but it is also the day Microsoft stated that Windows 7 had not yet hit RTM .
Although the final build had been compiled , Microsoft still had to put it through testing before christening it as RTM .
Who gets it when ?
OEMs will be the first to get their mitts on the final Windows 7 code , with the English - language version being sent out on July 24 and remaining languages on July 28 .
They 're first in line as they need to prepare Windows 7 for new PCs .
Next up are ISVs and IHVs , who can grab the RTM build from Microsoft Connect and MSDN on August 6 , as can MSDN and TechNet subscribers .
Volume License customers with Software Assurance are next , with the English - language version available to them on August 7 and other languages shortly thereafter .
Partner Program Gold / Certified members gain access on August 16 and Action Pack subscribers on August 23 with access to the other languages to come by October 1 .
Last up are consumers , who can purchase Windows 7 on October 22 .
Microsoft has confirmed that Windows 7 testers will not be getting a free copy of the new operating system , as Windows Vista testers received the Ultimate edition for sending in at least one bug .
The company suggested that this might happen back when invites to test the operating system were sent in December 2008 .
Therefore , unless they fall into one of the other categories above , beta testers will have to wait like all other consumers until October 22 .
Family Pack for Windows 7
On the Windows 7 Team Blog Microsoft confirmed rumors from earlier last month about a three - computer " Family Pack " deal for Windows 7 Home Premium : " I 'm happy to confirm that we will indeed be offering a family pack of Windows 7 Home Premium ( in select markets ) which will allow installation on up to three PCs . "
Microsoft refused , however , to disclose when the pack would become available or how much it would go for , though many are expecting the price tag to be $ 150 .
Microsoft started work on Windows 7 with partners much earlier than it did with Windows Vista , and beta testers are reporting that the decision has paid off thus far .
Whether that is true or not will become evident in the coming months .
Today 's major announcement follows pricing details made in June 2009 and edition details made in February 2009 .
New York has a long history as a magnet for the poor and the homeless .
Even the famous poem on the Statue of Liberty , addressed to the world 's " huddled masses " , exhorts : " Send these , the homeless , tempest - tossed to me . . . ! "
But now ?
Not so much .
A New York scheme to send hundreds of homeless people on a one - way ticket out of town has led to more than 550 families relocated since 2007 .
Under the scheme , initiated by New York 's mayor Mike Bloomberg , the city pays for bus and plane tickets , or petrol vouchers , to destinations varying from cities elsewhere within the US mainland to places like South Africa or Puerto Rico .
The scheme is aimed at saving the costs of putting up homeless families in expensive shelters .
It only happens if a family can show they have relatives to stay with elsewhere who are willing to look after them .
Then New York will stump up the cash and make the arrangements for them to get out of town , often within a few days of agreeing to leave .
The level of help varies .
One couple from Michigan were given $ 400 ( £ 240 ) in petrol cards so that they could drive home after a failed quest to find New York jobs .
Another family of five got free plane tickets to Paris and then free rail tickets when they arrived to get them to the northern French town of Granville .
Though the travel expenses can often cost thousands of dollars , city officials say it is cheaper than housing families in shelters which can cost around $ 36,000 a year .
However , the plan has stirred up controversy among charity organisations that work with homeless families .
Some say the scheme is a welcome addition to the city 's armoury of ways of dealing with a chronic homeless problem .
" It is a good plan , " said one director at a homeless shelter who did not want to be named .
But others say it does little to tackle the real underlying issues of homelessness in the city and the huge lack of affordable housing in a metropolis famed for its sky - high rents and property prices .
One of the plan 's critics is Arnold Cohen , chief executive of Partnership for the Homeless .
Cohen says the scheme does not have enough interest in seeing whether families sent out of the city become homeless again or even return to New York .
As such , Cohen says , it is only dealing with short - term issues and not doing anything to help people properly turn their lives around .
" There is no exploration of whether the family members they are sent to have a long - term relationship with them .
They may just become homeless again , but in a new city .
Or they may come back , " he said .
But other homeless advocates have praised the effort to help families that in many ways have become stranded in New York and welcome the help to get back home .
" We are in the compassion business and we are seeing families reunited , " said James Winans , development director of the famed Bowery Mission in Manhattan .
Despite the scheme , homelessness is likely to remain a major problem in New York especially in the midst of a brutal recession .
The one thing all homeless advocates agree on is a crippling shortage of affordable housing and the need for more employment training so that homeless people can get a home and a job .
Only then will the real issues that cause the problem be dealt with .
" The programme just shows the huge demand for housing in the city that is currently just so unaffordable , " said Josh Lockwood , executive director of Habitat - NYC , the local affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International .
The closest British equivalent to the New York scheme was an initiative in London to relocate homeless families to towns with a surplus of homes , such as Huddersfield .

WASHINGTON – The Obama administration will raise its forecast for the 10 - year federal budget deficit to about $ 9 trillion from $ 7.1 trillion , a senior administration official said .
The White House will try to use the new estimate as extra ammunition as it seeks a health - care overhaul in Congress .
The administration says its policies are aimed at driving down long - term medical costs .
The estimate reflects the grim long - term U.S. fiscal outlook , as baby boomers retire in increasing numbers and costs continue to soar for federal entitlements , particularly health - care programs such as Medicare .
The latest measurement puts the White House in line with previous updates from the Congressional Budget Office .
The change stems in part from downward revisions of projected economic activity since late 2008 , when the administration began putting together its latest forecast .
Earlier this week , the administration said it would shrink its estimate for the 2009 deficit to about $ 1.58 trillion from $ 1.84 trillion .
That is because of generally lower - than - anticipated costs for various financial - sector bailouts .
But CBO 's estimate could vary significantly , some budget experts say .
By any measure , the 2009 budget deficit is expected to be the widest since World War II as a percentage of the economy .
Karlheinz Schreiber is seen inside a car at the entrance of the prison in Augsburg , Germany on Monday .
( ( Uwe LeinAssociated Press ) ) Karlheinz Schreiber , a key figure in a political party financing scandal involving former prime minister Brian Mulroney and former German chancellor Helmut Kohl , arrived in Germany on Monday and has been jailed after losing a decade - long extradition battle in Canada .
The 75 - year - old former arms - industry lobbyist landed in Munich around 9:30 a.m. local time , and was taken to a jail in nearby Augsburg , where prosecutors accuse him of bribery and tax evasion .
At a news conference Monday , chief prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz said Schreiber will appear in court on Tuesday to have the arrest warrant against him read , and then a judge will decide whether to keep him in custody pending formal charges .
Nemetz said it had taken " too long , too long " to bring Schreiber back from Canada .
When asked why he thought it had been such a protracted process , Nemetz replied , " Ask your Canadian officials please . "
Reinhard Nemetz , chief prosecutor of a court in Augsburg , Germany , gestures during a Monday news conference about the extradition of Karlheinz Schreiber .
( ( Michael Dalder / Reuters ) )
About 60 reporters attended the news conference in Augsburg , and the Schreiber saga is big news all over Germany , said the CBC's Harvey Cashore , who was there and has been covering the story for several years .
" It is leading the [ hourly news ] .
It is on the front page of the Augsburg paper here — two huge stories .
You can't be in Germany and not know about the Schreiber story , " said Cashore .
Schreiber , a dual German and Canadian citizen , was arrested in Canada in 1999 under a German warrant .
He maintains the charges against him and his extradition from Canada are politically driven .
Allegations that Schreiber gave a cash donation in 1991 to the former treasurer of Kohl 's Christian Democratic Union party , Walther Leisler Kiep , triggered a scandal that only deepened with Kohl 's 1999 admission that he had personally accepted illegal donations from supporters .
Kohl was Germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 .
Sending letter ' unfair ' : lawyer
Most recently , Schreiber was allowed to stay in Canada to testify before the Oliphant inquiry , saying he gave Mulroney $ 300,000 in cash to get a light - armoured vehicle plant set up in Canada .
That inquiry wrapped up last week , kick - starting the extradition process .
Canada 's Justice Department served him papers late Friday afternoon giving him 48 hours to turn himself in to be extradited to Germany .
He tried one last time to fight extradition , but that attempt was quashed .
The federal justice minister said Schreiber has had every reasonable opportunity over the last several years to challenge his extradition .
Now that Schreiber is back in Germany , one of two things will happen — he will go on trial and either be convicted or acquitted , his Canadian lawyer , Edward Greenspan , told CBC in an interview Monday .
" If he 's acquitted , he will come back to Canada because he has been a Canadian citizen for over 30 years and this is his country as much as any other … .
If he 's convicted and given a sentence in Germany , he will seek to spend that time in jail in Canada . "
Mulroney denies wrongdoing
According to Greenspan , others in Germany have been tried on similar charges and acquitted .
" We were unable to get the German government to reconsider dropping some of the charges in Germany , but now that he 's back , they 're going to have to take a hard look at what they 're going to proceed with … .
I think you 'll see an indictment that will have less charges than it presently has , " he said .
" There 's a lot of people out to get " Schreiber , said Greenspan , but neither he nor his client believes in giving up .
" There is a fight to be had and there are governments that are doing everything in their power to make sure that he 's convicted and goes to jail for a long time . "
Just before Schreiber turned himself in at a Toronto jail Sunday , Greenspan had said the timing of the legal process taking place over a holiday weekend was unfair .
" No minister of justice should act in that kind of an underhanded manner .
It should have been sent in the normal course , but by sending it Friday at 5:10 , by then everybody in the Department of Justice has gone north for the long weekend ... there was nothing I could do . "
Mulroney has denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with Schreiber , who alleges the Canadian leader agreed to take money from him while still in office .
Mulroney acknowledges he accepted money from Schreiber in exchange for promoting a project involving a light armoured vehicle factory on behalf of Germany 's Thyssen AG , but only after leaving politics .

British documentary makers Robin Forestier - Walker and Oliver Owen have been tracing Nigerians who fought against the Japanese in Burma during World War II .
On VJ Day , the anniversary of victory over Japan , they tell the veterans ' story .
Private African Banana also served as a peacekeeper in Congo and Chad Mohammed was just 16 when he was pressed into British military service in northern Nigeria against his will .
Now , almost 70 years on , the old war veteran claims he hid his true identity from the recruiting officer .
It was as Private African Banana that he went on to travel 6,300 miles ( 10,100 km ) to the jungles of Burma in the Royal West African Frontier Force .
And he has been known as African Banana ever since .
The contribution of West Africans was played down in official versions of the Allied war in Asia , and until now , few have had an opportunity to tell their tale .
In fact , only two in 10 of the soldiers who fought in Burma were white .
The role of Indians and Gurkhas is known .
But when Allied commander General William Slim thanked his 14th army at the end of the campaign , he did not even mention the Africans .
Jungle warfare Nigerians made up more than half of the total force of 90,000 West African soldiers deployed to South East Asia after 1943 as part of the British Army 's 81st and 82nd ( West Africa ) Divisions .
Although the Burma campaign ended 64 years ago , many remain bitter that their contribution was never adequately recognised .
Initially I saw the white man as someone better than me .
But after the war , I considered him an equal
Former infantryman Dauda Kafanchan
They were central to the push to clear Japanese forces out of the jungle and mountain ranges of Burma , from where they threatened British India .
This was achieved through a gruelling campaign of jungle marches , battles and ambushes , in which supplies were delivered entirely by air .
Usman Katsina remembers it well .
" Everything that was meant to be used - your food , your clothes , everything - was given to you and you were required to carry it , on your head and back .
Some even died from exhaustion , from travelling long distances , with a heavy load , " he says .
Some of those who earned the coveted Burma Star had already fought against Mussolini 's forces in East Africa .
West Africans also joined special Chindit units under the command of General Orde Wingate .
The Chindits fought deep inside Japanese - held territory to disrupt lines of communication .
Their enemy was an extremely dangerous opponent .
Japanese soldiers were trained well in the art of jungle warfare , where the first rule was concealment .
It was a skill the Nigerian troops had to learn too .
" The Japanese in the jungle were just like snakes - they hid before you could see them , it was very hard , " recalls 97 - year - old Hassan Sokoto .
' Lack of recognition ' Umaru Yola fought in the 4th Battalion , Nigeria Regiment .
He described how he was hit in the head with a piece of shrapnel that left him with a hole in his skull .
" I did n't die , so God must have decided to give me a long life , " he says .
Many of the veterans feel they were failed by the British after the war African recruits served as drivers , artillerymen , engineers , medics and clerks , as well as infantrymen and carriers .
Officer positions were reserved for white expatriates from Britain and other parts of the empire , with only one notable exception : Lieutenant Seth Anthony from the Gold Coast was the British Army 's first African officer .
Despite the hierarchy , the war in Burma played some part in breaking down the race barriers of the era .
" Initially I saw the white man as someone better than me .
But after the war , I considered him an equal , " recalls former infantryman Dauda Kafanchan .
In post - war Nigeria , the colonial government gave some veterans land to begin new lives as farmers .
The project was also a scheme to reduce their potential impact as a new political force .
" We wanted work .
But what could we do ?
We were under colonial rule and we could n't change anything , " said veteran Dangombe , who found himself without prospects at the war 's end .
Nigerian soldiers who chose to continue their military careers went on to form the core of independent Nigeria 's national army , which retains the 81st and 82nd Divisions to this day .
Private Banana later served as a peacekeeper in the Congo and Chad .
And he returned to the frontline alongside many of his former comrades in Nigeria 's bloody 1967 - 1970 civil war .
But many of his former comrades feel the British abandoned their responsibilities to their former servicemen .
Although they were paid off for their service , some claim they were promised allowances which were never paid , despite their repeated efforts over the years .
And it is not only the money - some veterans are still bitter over what they see as a lack of recognition .
" We were supposed to get Long Service and British Empire Medals " says Dangombe .
" But up until now - nothing . "

Peak oil obsessives are too focused on the " physical availability of conventional " oil , which is blinding them to a bigger issue , writes John Kemp at Reuters :
First , the definition of " conventional " changes over time as a result of price and technology .
Deepwater oil only became conventional 20 years ago , and ultra -deepwater in the last decade .
In future , higher prices and technology changes could eventually shift ocean and arctic output into the " conventional " category and increase the reserve base substantially .
Second , the focus on conventional oil obscures the much larger reserve base of other hydrocarbons -- natural gas , coal , bitumen ( oil sands ) , and kerogen ( oil shale ) , let alone methane hydrates ( natural gas trapped in ice formations at the polar ice caps , in the permafrost zone and on the ocean floor ) .
... The question is cost .
Most techniques are expensive compared with drilling and refining conventional crude , though not excessively so ( $ 40 - 120 per barrel ) .
They tend to be energy intensive ( so the net energy gain is lower than with conventional crude ) .
But they are workable and feasible .
Blinded by their obsession with physical availability of conventional oil , peak oilers miss the much larger questions : how much will these alternative hydrocarbons cost and what happens to the environment if we combust them all and do n't find a way to trap the CO2 ?
How Did The Banks Used The TARP Funds ?
“ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ”
Today , the Committee On Oversight and Government Reform is holding a hearing titled : “ Following the money : Report of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) . ”
Neil Barofsky , the Special Inspector General , will release his 3RD report to Congress and present his findings and audit report on how recipients have used TARP funds .
So far , the Treasury has already committed $ 643 billion and spent $ 441 billion under the program .
Committee Chairman , Edolphus Town , writes in his statement :
“ The findings of the Inspector General ( IG ) , quite frankly , are astonishing .
According to the IG , the TARP has become a program in which taxpayers are not being told what TARP recipients are doing with their money , have not been told what their investments are worth , and will not be told the full details of how their money is being invested .
He found that even though Treasury receives monthly reports of the value of TARP investments , it will not make that information public .
Incredibly , the Treasury Department has taken the position that it will not even ask TARP recipients what they are doing with the taxpayers money .
In short , the taxpayers now have a $ 700 billion program that is being used under the philosophy of ‘ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ' ”
In his report , the Inspector General expresses concerns about the lack of transparency in the TARP program .
He writes :
“ Although Treasury has taken some steps toward improving transparency in TARP programs , it has repeatedly failed to adopt recommendations that SIGTARP believes are essential to providing basic transparency and fulfill Treasury ’s stated commitment to implement TARP with ‘ the highest degree of accountability and transparency possible ’ . ”
One has to seriously wonder what happened to candidate Obama ’s lofty promises in terms of providing an “ historic level of accountability & transparency in government . ”
It happened to Al Szekley , a Nam vet who was shot in the spine in Fu Bai in 1972 .
I see vets like Al all over the place but especially at patriotic events in downtown assemblages all over America .
They usually sit on curbs right next to the band shell and they are usually fractured from the pot / booze combo .
I am a sucker for people who are hurting , but when I see a Nam vet especially one in a wheelchair , I get a lump in my throat .
There is a special glow about them almost like a halo .
Al was sitting in his permanent prison on wheels on G St. in D.C.
He lives here and sleeps here now .
At 62 , he is just entering the ranks of the poor and old but he has been poor for decades .
Eight months ago he was evicted from a homeless shelter because of an outstanding warrant which he never answered .
The warrant was for sleeping on a sidewalk in a Washington suburb .
Follow me closely .
The odds are that if Al slept on a sidewalk in anyin America in his wheelchair they would just let him be .
The keyword here is SUBURB .
It just happened that Al ran afoul of the law in Virginia but it could just have well have been in any ritzy suburb , let 's say for an example , Spring Lake , N.J. .
They give you a ticket for parking your car in the street overnight in Spring Lake .
Can you imagine what those people in those 5 million dollar houses overlooking the Atlantic Ocean would do with this homeless vet sleeping in his wheelchair in front of one of those stately mansions ?
Oh my God .
Think of what it would do to their resale values ?
Oh the shame of it .
But back to Al Szekely .
Let 's look at the whole story .
Obviously , I suspect you well off suburbans are thinking ; Not so .
Al is an " ordained minister , who does not drink , do drugs or curse in front of ladies " according to Ms Ehrenreich , NY Times columnist .
So you see the headline to this article is real .
I happens every day in Poor and Rich America .

With the current economic climate , there has been much discussion about the origins of the financial crisis and the future of capitalism .
In these typically hollow debates , Adam Smith is routinely and thoughtlessly invoked as the founder of modern capitalist though , based on unrestrained trade , limited government , and the mechanics of market economies .
To this day , The Wealth of Nations is held up as the espousal tome for free - market ideology that decries government regulation , excessive taxation , and wealth redistribution ( in whatever contrived shapes it may take ) .
But the myth of Adam Smith created by two centuries of advanced industrialization and capitalism is very far from the reality of Adam Smith .
The majority of academics and pundits alike generalize on Smith ’s observations about the invisible hand , the benefits of division of labor , and the growth of wealth through free trade .
Outside of these points ,
The Wealth of Nations serves as an of his time reaction to the impact of corporations and mercantile interests on economies and governments .
More specifically , Smith spent much of his book reacting to the growth of the East India Company , whose stockholders were to be found on every level of government decision making in Great Britain and thought to be adversely effecting foreign policy and internal financial systems .
Smith was also appalled at the exploitation under the reign of the East India Company , including the starvation of over 30 million people in modern - day Bangladesh due to British - imposed tariffs .
As Chomsky notes , Smith saw the East India Company and other stockholding corporations as bending state policy towards the good of the few at the expense of the many .
Smith to this end was in favor of heavy - handed government regulation to prevent financial and corporate powers from manipulating government policy for their own ends .
This led him to conclude on the nefarious impulse of corporate manipulation , that when “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices .
It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings , by any law which either could be executed , or would be consistent with liberty and justice .
But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together , it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies ; much less to render them necessary . ”
The legacy of Smith continues to diverge further and further from the reality of Smiths principles which were heavily influenced by Rousseau and other humanist figures of the Enlightenment .
Smith advocated for a system of progressive taxation and a political economy centered on the freedom of creative pursuits but protective of the working class .
Considering how his legacy is enshrined today , it seems out of place to realize that Smith ’s chief concern was for economic policy to be secondary to moral and ethical concerns such as economic equality , freedom of speech , and dignified and just labor conditions .

Rose Friedman , a free - market economist whose extraordinary collaboration with her husband , Milton , proved essential to his Nobel - prize - winning career , died Tuesday at her home in Davis , Calif .
Her birth records have been lost , but her family said she was probably 98 .
The cause was heart failure , according to a statement approved by the family and issued by the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice , founded by Milton and Rose Friedman in 1996 to promote school vouchers and other school - choice policies .
Rose Director , as she was known after her family emigrated to the United States from Russia , met Milton Friedman in 1932 when they were both graduate students at the University of Chicago .
They wed six years later , and their marriage lasted 68 years , until Mr. Friedman ’s death in 2006 .
A Nobel laureate and a giant of 20th - century economics , Mr. Friedman was a libertarian thinker who believed that government had an obligation to clear a path for markets and that economic freedom was crucial to a free society .
His work provided a fundamental stanchion of the presidency of Ronald Reagan and the administration of Margaret Thatcher in Britain .
In a very shocking development a young 32 year old person , father of four kids looses his life during the filming of a reality show sponsored by Unilever and being produced by their advertising agency Mindshare .
Saad Khan was a game show contestant and the host / model Amina Sheikh , who also is the model of Clear Shampoo , gave an underwater challenge to Saad and during the execution of the stunt he apparently lost control , struggled and pleading for help could not recover , the inadequate safety personal and the equipment could not react in time and eventually he drowned
Saad Khan , 32 year old young man from Karachi and a father of four kids is sadly the victim , his body was returned to Karachi for burial two days back and the infuriated family has been running from pillar to post but it seems for some awkward reason it fails to catch the media attention and apparently no media house is ready to ‘ run the story ‘ .
It is a known fact that the media in Pakistan is usually head over heals on every other lame ass political slander , but surprisingly in Saad ’s case this case of gross neglect is not worthy of even a short news item .
Might this have anything to do with the influence of Unilever and Mindshare who are giant spenders armed with enormous advertisement budgets .
Initially Saad ’s family was furious hoping to have Unilever cough up full responsibility , but at the moment they feel that the most important thing to look forward to is the future of Saad ’s four kids who have no future .
Aarpix :
These details are given by a 2nd cousin of Saad on the condition of anonymity .
Saad was 31 , 6′2 ″ , handsome man was employed at RBS ( formerly ABN AMRO ) .
Saad live a very ambitious and thrilled life .
In his professional life , he had accomplished more than his age .
He had well established career and did n’t participate for the prize money or anything .
He was rather very thrilling and adventurous .
He was disqualified from the show after a few days but was then called by the death on a wild card entry .
He did not lose his balance in the water – he was an excellent swimmer but the doctors in Thailand after carrying out an autopsy told that his muscle had pulled and he had some weight tied up to his feet as part of the challenge and so could not make it back up .
He was under water for about 6 minutes .
Saad has left a widow and 4 kids :
Oldest one is 7 years old , then twins of age 5.5 and then the youngest who is only 1.5 years of age .
While this story is slowly making its way around , it seems that some serious counter efforts were made against Farhan Janjua of Aarpix , who first broke the story , WebHosting Pad suddenly issued Aarpix a short notice disabling his website for “ nature of content ” [ do have a look at Aarpix and see if you find any objectionable material ] they then told Farhan to quickly move his data with immediate effect or else they will delete his content [ 4 years of hard work ] – panicking the poor chap found a local friend willing to help him , but as soon as the DNS prorogation started ‘ someone ’ called Farhan ’s friend and asked questions about Aarpix and if they can possibly ‘ have the owners cell phone number ’ worrying for the safety of his friends Farhan resolved to buy a sever internationally and used their support services to help salvage the at - risk data .
As I write this post at 2 am Aarpix is slowly coming back online .
I strongly believe these scare tactics must be condemned , Unilever / Mindshare should be held accountable for this accident and must be forced to offer compensation to the grieved family with immediate effect .
I do not mean merely doling out a paltry 1 lac rupees to the affected family but stress a far more expensive compensation to widow and the four kids who now have a life to live without the primary bread earner and literally no husband or father to look after them .
May Allah give them the courage and patience to recover from this tragic incident
UPDATE : Just noticed that Dawn.com is also playing some mischief in this incident as well , the above Obituatry message was published in Sunday ’s edition of Dawn , 23rd August , 2009 .
If you scroll to page 14 Karachi Metropolian section within the online archive hosted at epaper.dawn.com you do see this image in small print , but clicking on Saad Khan ’s Obituary , and it comes with an error “ The Article image is missing ” , might this be an accidental mistake , possible but aint it too coincidental ?
UPDATE 2 : The missing image from the epaper edition of Dawn.com has been fixed , one of their adminstrators personally called me up to inform me that it was a site - wide problem for that particular day , and the website administrators are fixing it with immediate effect , he has reassured me that there was no foul play .
It was an Obituary ad and does not come under the editorial control of Dawn , even if they wanted to
A water shortage described as the most critical since the earliest days of Iraq 's civilisation is threatening to leave up to 2 million people in the south of the country without electricity and almost as many without drinking water .
An already meagre supply of electricity to Iraq 's fourth - largest city of Nasiriyah has fallen by 50 % during the last three weeks because of the rapidly falling levels of the Euphrates river , which has only two of four power - generating turbines left working .
If , as predicted , the river falls by a further 20 cm during the next fortnight , engineers say the remaining two turbines will also close down , forcing a total blackout in the city .
Down river , where the Euphrates spills out into the Shatt al - Arab waterway at the north - eastern corner of the Persian Gulf , the lack of fresh water has raised salinity levels so high that two towns , of about 3,000 people , on the northern edge of Basra have this week evacuated .
" We can no longer drink this water , " said one local woman from the village of al - Fal .
" Our animals are all dead and many people here are diseased . "
Iraqi officials have been attempting to grapple with the magnitude of the crisis for months , which , like much else in this fractured society , has many causes , both man-made and natural .
Two winters of significantly lower than normal rainfalls – half the annual average last year and one - third the year before – have followed six years of crippling instability , in which industry barely functioned and agriculture struggled to meet half of subsistence needs .
" For thousands of years Iraq 's agricultural lands were rich with planted wheat , rice and barley , " said Salah Aziz , director of planning in Iraq 's agricultural ministry , adding that land was " 100 % in use " .
" This year less than 50 % of the land is in use and most of the yields are marginal .
This year we cannot begin to cover even 40 % of Iraq 's fruit and vegetable demand . "
During the last five chaotic years , many new dams and reservoirs have been built in Turkey , Syria and Iran , which share the Euphrates and its small tributaries .
The effect has been to starve the Euphrates of its lifeblood , which throughout the ages has guaranteed bountiful water , even during drought .
At the same time , irrigators have tried tilling marginal land in an attempt for quick yields and in all cases the projects have been abandoned .
" Not even during Saddam 's time did we face the prospect of something so grave , " said Nasiriyah 's governor , Qusey al - Ebadi .
Just east of the city , the Marsh Arabs are also on the edge of a crisis – unprecedented even during the three decades of reprisals they faced under the former dictator .
" The current level of the Euphrates cannot feed the small tributaries that give water to the marshlands , " he continued .
" The people there have started to dig wells for their own survival .
There is no water to use for washing , because it is stagnant and contaminated .
Many of the animals have contracted disease and died and people with animals are leaving their areas . "
Nowhere is Iraq 's water shortage more stark than in what used to be the marshlands .
Towards the Iranian border and south to the Gulf , rigid and yellowing reeds jut from a hard - baked landscape of cracked mud .
Skiffs that once plied the lowland waters lie dry and splintering and ducks wallow in fetid green ponds that pocket the maze of feeder streams .
Steel cans of drinking water bought by desperate locals line dirt roads like over - sized letter boxes .
The Euphrates , once broad and endlessly green , is now narrow and drab .
In parts it is a slick black ooze , fit only for scores of bathing water buffalo .
Giant pumps lay metres out of reach .
Some are rusting .
" Not long ago , the level of the Euphrates was at this rust line , " said Awda Khasaf , a local leader in the al - Akerya marshlands , as he pointed at the dwindling river .
" It has now dropped more than 1.5 m .
This river feeds all the agriculture lands and marsh lands in Nasiriyah .
It smells like this because it is stagnant , " he said .
" We turned to agriculture in 1991 after Saddam 's rampage , but now the government has ordered us to stop rice farming . "
Further up the river Sheikh Amar Hameed , 44 , from Abart village said : " We have lost the soul of our lives with the vanishing water .
We have lost everything .
We are buying drinking water now .
The government must find a solution .
The young will all become thieves .
They have no prospects . "
Iraq 's water minister , Dr Abdul Latif Rashid , this week estimated that up to 300,000 marshland residents are on the move , many of them newly uprooted and heading for nearby towns and cities that can do little to support them .
The Marsh Arabs are semi-nomadic and large numbers have remained displaced since Saddam drained the marshes in 1991 .
" In the last 20 - 30 years our neighbouring countries have built a number of structures for collecting water or diverting water for their agricultural lands , " Dr Rashid said .
" In some cases , they have diverted the path of the river for their internal use .
This has had a very damaging effect .
We have a large number of branches of the Tigris that we share with Iran .
In most their volumes are low , or completely dried up .
In 2006 /07 [ the marshlands ] almost reached 75 % of original levels .
Now the surface water is around 20 % .
Water resources have this year become not only serious , but critical .
Iraq has not faced a water shortage like this . "
Officials have tried to compensate by digging wells and bores , especially in the ravaged provinces of the south and in Anbar , west of Baghdad .
Delegations have also travelled to Turkey and Syria , where they were warmly received , but have achieved few changes .
" We were expecting much more of a release from Turkey , " Dr Rashid said .
" Iran has been less receptive .
We have had no response from them at all . "
River wars
Nile Nine Nile basin countries are in dispute over water - sharing .
Countries including Uganda and Rwanda are attempting to overrule a 1959 treaty that restricted building on the river without Egypt 's consent .
Egypt is reliant on the volume of water it currently receives .
Euphrates Iraq and Syria oppose the building of dams on the river by Turkey .
Iraq is reliant on the river for irrigation , and damming upriver seriously affects water flow .
Jordan Israel and Palestine share a water aquifer along the West Bank , but Palestinians only have access to one fifth of the water held there .
They are also in dispute over the river Jordan , with Israel claiming 90 % control .
Indus Pakistan is in dispute with India over the Indus river that supplies water to millions .
Reservoirs and dams have caused water shortages in downstream areas , such as Karachi .
A presidential decision to provide more water to the population in Sindh by closing the Tarbela Dam also caused outrage in neighbouring Punjab , whose water was being diverted .

According to a bloody video posted on Facebook today , a 23 year old male committed suicide shortly after being released from prison by jumping off of an overpass .
The description accompanying the video explains that the boy was arrested for participating in Iran ’s post-election demonstrations .
“ After he was tortured and raped in prison his father posted bail but they came back to take him again , ” it says .
“ He ran away and he went up a pedestrian bridge above the Keshavarze Street in Esfahan and he threw himself over . ”
The man you see in the video is the boy ’s father .

A two pence rise in fuel duty has come into effect , the third such increase in nine months .
Stephen Glaister , director of road users ' pressure group RAC Foundation , told the BBC the government 's latest rise " will hit everybody hard " .
When VAT is included , the increase will actually total 2.3 p .
The average price of petrol across the UK is about 105 p per litre .
The government says the extra duty is needed to help fund public investment .
' Huge effect ' AA president Edmund King said the timing of the rise was " pretty dire " , at a time when the UK economy was trying to exit recession .
If the money was going into public transport , drivers would be better off as there would be less cars on the road , less congestion for them
Richard George , Campaign for Better Transport Mr King said its members were already having to cut back on car journeys due to the high price of fuel , and that this would only increase following the latest rise , meaning the government 's revenues will not actually rise .
The Petrol Retailers Association pointed out that the price of fuel would increase again when VAT increases from 15 % to 17.5 % at the end of the year .
" It would have been preferable for the government to defer this increase until 2010 , " its spokesman said .
Jo Tanner , director of communications at the Freight Transport Association ( FTA ) , said existing high fuel prices were already having a " huge effect " on its members .
She said the freight transport sector had already seen its fuel bills rise by £ 800 m since last December , at the same time as a 50 % increase in insolvencies .
Richard George , a road and climate campaigner at the Campaign for Better Transport , said the government should be spending the duty increase on public transport , and not just putting it into the government 's general budget .
" If the money was going into public transport , drivers would be better off as there would be less cars on the road , less congestion for them , " he said .
Supermarket group Morrisons said it would not be increasing the cost of fuel at its forecourts until 6 September .

Jones owns a Ford .
Smith 's evidence might be that Jones has at all times in the past within Smith 's memory owned a car , and always a Ford , and that Jones has just offered Smith a ride while driving a Ford .
Let us imagine , now , that Smith has another friend , Brown , of whose whereabouts he is totally ignorant .
Smith selects three place names quite at random and constructs the following three propositions :
Either Jones owns a Ford , or Brown is in Boston .
Either Jones owns a Ford , or Brown is in Barcelona .
Either Jones owns a Ford , or Brown is in Brest - Litovsk .
Each of these propositions is entailed by ( f ) .
Imagine that Smith realizes the entailment of each of these propositions he has constructed by ( f ) , and proceeds to accept ( g ) , ( h ) , and ( i ) on the basis of ( f ) .
Smith has correctly inferred ( g ) , ( h ) , and ( i ) from a proposition for which be has strong evidence .
Smith is therefore completely justified in believing each of these three propositions , Smith , of course , has no idea where Brown is .

Dr. Joel D. Weisman , who was one of the first physicians to detect the AIDS epidemic and who became a national advocate for AIDS research , treatment and prevention , died Saturday at his Westwood home .
He was 66 .
FOR THE RECORD : An obituary about Dr. Joel Weisman that ran in Thursday ’s Section A had the first name of AIDS - research pioneer Dr. Michael S. Gottlieb incorrect as Martin .
An earlier version of the online caption also contained that error .
He had heart disease and had been ill for several months , said Bill Hutton , his domestic partner of 17 years .
Weisman was a general practitioner in Sherman Oaks in 1980 when he noticed a troubling pattern :
He had three seriously ill patients with the same constellation of symptoms , including mysterious fevers , rashes , drastic weight loss and swollen lymph nodes .
All were gay men whose problems seemed to stem from defects in their immune systems .
The physician wound up referring two of the patients to UCLA immunologist Martin S. Gottlieb , who had a gay male patient with a similarly strange array of afflictions .
Recognizing that these were not isolated cases , Weisman and Gottlieb wrote a report that appeared in the June 5 , 1981 , issue of the Centers for Disease Control ’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .
That report signaled the official start of the epidemic that the federal agency later named acquired immunodeficiency syndrome .
“ Joel was a very astute physician , ” Gottlieb said in an interview Wednesday .
“ In his practice he was alert to unusual symptoms in his patients .
He had a sense that something out of the ordinary was happening . ”
Gottlieb , who later treated perhaps the world ’s most famous AIDS patient , Rock Hudson , received most of the credit for identifying the disease .
But Weisman “ contributed his open eyes .
He felt right away he was observing something that was never seen before , ” said Mathilde Krim , a research scientist who , with Gottlieb , founded the New York - based nonprofit amfAR , the Foundation for AIDS Research .
Born on Feb. 20 , 1943 , in Newark , N.J. , Weisman graduated in 1970 from the Kansas City College of Osteopathy and practiced in New Jersey for a few years .
In 1975 , he acknowledged his homosexuality and ended a three - year marriage to start a new life in Los Angeles .
He joined a medical group in North Hollywood , where in 1978 he was presented with some puzzling cases : a gay Anglo man in his 30s who had Kaposi ’s sarcoma , a cancer usually seen in old Mediterranean men , and several men with shingles , another affliction normally seen in much older patients .
Weisman also had a number of patients with swollen lymph glands , often an indication of lymphoma , a type of cancer that originates in the immune system .
But in these cases , no lymphoma was detected .
In 1980 , he opened his own practice in Sherman Oaks with Dr. Eugene Rogolsky .
Weisman ’s sense of foreboding deepened with the arrival of two patients who had a panoply of confounding problems : persistent diarrhea , eczema , fungal infections , low white blood cell counts .
“ On top of these two cases , ” Randy Shilts wrote in his definitive AIDS chronicle , “ And the Band Played On ” ( 1987 ) , “ another 20 men had appeared at Weisman ’s office that year with strange abnormalities of their lymph nodes , ” the very condition that had triggered the spiral of ailments besetting Weisman and Rogolsky ’s other two , very sick patients .
“ It was dreadful .
We did n’t know what we were dealing with , ” Rogolsky recalled Wednesday .
In early 1981 , a colleague put Weisman in touch with Gottlieb .
Two decades later , Weisman recalled that he “ had a feeling going into the meeting that what this represented was the tip of the iceberg .
My sense was that these people were sick , ” he told the Washington Post in 2001 , “ and we had a lot of people that were potentially right behind them . ”
He sent his patients to UCLA Medical Center , where Gottlieb found they had pneumocystis pneumonia .
Gottlieb had earlier found the same pneumonia in his own patient .
He later diagnosed it in two gay men referred by other doctors .
A few months after their initial meeting , Weisman and Gottlieb wrote in the CDC bulletin that “ 5 young men , all active homosexuals , were treated for biopsy - confirmed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia at 3 different hospitals in Los Angeles , California .
Two of the patients died . ”
Eventually , the other three patients died too .
The report sounded an alarm heard around the world .
AIDS deaths in the U.S. rose exponentially , from 618 in 1982 to almost 90,000 by the end of the decade .
By 2002 the death toll surpassed 500,000 and was still climbing .
Weisman began to press for services for people with HIV and AIDS as founding chairman of AIDS Project Los Angeles in 1983 .
He also helped organize the first dedicated AIDS unit in Southern California at what is now Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center .
He advocated for research dollars as an original board member of amfAR , which was formed in 1985 , and served as chairman from 1988 to 1992 .
Described by Shilts as “ the dean of Southern California gay doctors , ” Weisman continued to see patients , building his partnership with Rogolsky into the Pacific Oaks Medical Group , which became one of the largest private practices focused on the treatment of AIDS and HIV .
As soon as he became convinced that AIDS was sexually transmitted , Weisman began to warn patients that they needed to change their sexual behavior .
But during the early years of the crisis , his warnings too often were ignored .
“ I could n’t even make some of my friends listen , and they ’re dead now and that ’s disconcerting , ” he told The Times in 1988 .
Among the casualties was his partner of 10 years , Timothy Bogue , who died of AIDS in 1991 .
Battling the epidemic on the front lines “ made me look at issues of death and dying in a very different way , ” Weisman said in 1988 .
“ What makes somebody a good physician in this situation ?
Is it just winning ?
Keeping people alive ?
If I looked at every death as a defeat , I would not be able to continue . ”
In 1997 , he stepped away from the battle , ironically just as new drug cocktails were extending the lives of AIDS patients .
In 2000 , he moved to New York , where he ran a bed - and - breakfast with Hutton , but he returned to Southern California about five years ago .
He was an active ambassador for AIDS Project Los Angeles until illness overtook him this year .
In addition to Hutton , Weisman is survived by a brother , Mark ; a daughter , Stacey Weisman - Bogue Foster ; a granddaughter ; and two nieces .
Memorial donations may be sent to amfAR , AIDS Project Los Angeles or the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences College of Osteopathic Medicine .
Plans for a memorial service will be announced later .

In my recent Prototype Vs. InFamous video you may remember that I found myself unable to honestly call either game the best .
Both were stronger in individual areas - Infamous wins on story and side missions while Prototype wins on combat and dick potential - but overall they balance each other out .
I was n't satisfied , though .
There has to be a winner , if only to decide which name to read out first when giving out the joint prize .
So at the end of that video I suggested an unbiased tie - breaker that could be kept unaffected by actual game quality .
Namely , which of the two studios could produce the best image of the rival game 's main character wearing women 's lingerie .
Well , imagine my surprise when representatives from both Sucker Punch and Radical announced their intention to take this final showdown seriously .
So , without further ado , let 's set out on this visual odyssey , and never speak of it again .

Our product of freedom is competing with an illegal product .
The federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sell servitude .
It s that simple .
The 10th amendment positions our competitor as an outlaw and recent actions in Washington reaffirm this claim .
This brings us to our first point of strategic significance :
A movement based on the 10th amendment is undeniably lawful and moral .
Washington is selling servitude .
On fundamental issues , we the people are no longer represented by our national politicians .
Our political leaders do not respect the people .
They do not bother to read bills that steal away our money and freedom , but then they support these bills aggressively .
They set up final votes at midnight in hopes that we do not notice the theft .
They pit us against one another by highlighting trivial , but polarizing issues .
When the people scream for a solution that doesnt fit their personal quest for power they shelve the debate instead of making changes that would benefit the people .
Despite this disrespect , many national leaders stay in office forever and when real opportunities arise to fill seats with true freedom oriented candidates , the establishment candidates step up , promote and install new big government - types that are mirror images of themselves .
It is about personal power not representation .
Washington is selling servitude .

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - Global carbon dioxide emissions in 2008 rose 1.94 percent year - on - year to 31.5 billion metric tons , German renewable energy industry institute IWR said on Monday , based on official information and its own research .

The private institute , which is based in Muenster and advises German ministries , said climate - harming carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions rose for the tenth year in succession , running counter to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol aimed at trying to cut CO2 emissions by 5.2 percent by 2012 .
IWR recommends linking measured emissions to individual countries ’ renewable energy investment commitments .
It said if negotiators adopted this approach , it could stabilize overall fossil fuels consumption and related CO2 emissions .
“ Kyoto is not working out , ” said IWR Managing Director Norbert Allnoch .
Global emissions are 40 percent above those in 1990 , the basis year for the treaty .
“ ( Our recommendation ) is a better approach than trying to persuade countries to curb their industrial activities , which inevitably creates hostility and bickering over who should be doing what to protect the climate , ” he said .
The approach would involve linking the CO2 output of each of the 65 countries and some other regions to investments in renewable energy industries such as wind , solar or biofuels .
Some 120 billion euros ( $ 170.3 billion ) were invested in renewables in 2008 , IWR said .
It said this should at least be quadrupled to total around 500 billion euros a year for the world to reverse the runaway trend in CO2 pollution .
“ The higher the CO2 emissions , the higher the renewables investment in each country should be , ” Allnoch said .
Carbon dioxide emissions from heavy industry participating in the European Union ’s Emissions Trading Scheme fell 3.1 percent last year compared with 2007 , the EU ’s executive Commission said in mid-May .
This was due to falling industrial output from the global economic slowdown , it said .
VANCOUVER —
More than 100 new forest fires are starting each day in B.C. ’s forests , and the province has already burned through double its average firefighting budget , officials say .
Thousands of homes have been evacuated as the fires threaten communities throughout southern British Columbia and an area at least 32 times the size of Stanley Park .
Hot , dry weather mixed with lightning storms has pushed the fire risk up to critical levels in 85 per cent of the province , fire information officer Radha Fisher said on Monday .
“ The conditions are prime for fires , ” Fisher said .
“ We have seen big fire seasons in the past and we are seeing one now . ”
In an average fire season , which runs from April to October , there are 1,200 fires by the first week of August , according to statistics from the past seven years .
This year , there have already been 2,200 fires .
Between 500 and 700 fires are burning in the province on any given day , Fisher said , with 100 to 150 new ones starting each day .
On Sunday , for example , 100 fires began , most ignited by lightning and a handful caused by humans .
On Monday afternoon , another fire broke out on Blackcomb Mountain .
It spread to 10 hectares in an area called Ruby Bowl , about one kilometre up the slope from last week ’s Crystal Ridge fire , said Mike McCulley , a provincial fire information officer .
Helicopters were battling the blaze , and air tankers were expected to help out .
The increase in fires has boosted firefighting costs to $ 110 million so far this year , Fisher said .
That ’s up from the average of $ 50 million a year , based on the past seven years .
One thousand provincial firefighters are battling the blazes across the province , with the help of 800 out - of - province fire fighters .
Another 750 people are contracted by the province to cool hot spots and patrol fires .
Dozens of helicopters , aircraft and heavy equipment are also spread throughout the provinces as needed .
Another 1,000 people are working behind the scenes as fire information officers and incident managers .
And the fire season is far from over .
" Some fires do n't go out until the snow flies , " Fisher said .
" We are going to control them where we can , but some of these fires will only be put out by Mother Nature . "
In 2003 , the last extraordinary fire year , August was the peak month for fires said Fisher .
August 2009 has started with a vengeance .
At least 4,850 British Columbians are staying in hotels , schools , or with friends after forest fires forced them from their homes .
The 3,333 - hectare Mount McLean fire forced 2,300 Lillooet residents from their homes on Sunday night after the section of fire threatening the town grew from 100 hectares to 300 hectares .
Neighbouring first nations communities of Bridge River and Kayoosh First Nations have also been evacuated .
The fire , which is burning within a kilometre of the closest home , is being fuelled by hectares of dry timber , said fire information officer Garry Horley .
“ I was watching on the hill last night and every once in a while there ’d just be a huge ball of flame .
It was just like it exploded , ” Horley said .
“ It was just phenomenal . ”

In Finding the Source , a commenter says :
I have begun wondering whether claiming to be victim of ' akrasia ' might just be a way of admitting that your real preferences , as revealed in your actions , do n't match the preferences you want to signal ( believing what you want to signal , even if untrue , makes the signals more effective ) .
I think I 've seen Robin put forth something like this argument [ EDIT : Something related , but very different ] , and TGGP points out that Brian Caplan explicitly believes pretty much the same thing1 :
I 've previously argued that much - perhaps most - talk about " self - control " problems reflects social desirability bias rather than genuine inner conflict .
Part of the reason why people who spend a lot of time and money on socially disapproved behaviors say they " want to change " is that that 's what they 're supposed to say .
Think of it this way : A guy loses his wife and kids because he 's a drunk .
Suppose he sincerely prefers alcohol to his wife and kids .
He still probably wo n't admit it , because people judge a sinner even more harshly if he is unrepentent .
The drunk who says " I was such a fool ! " gets some pity ; the drunk who says " I like Jack Daniels better than my wife and kids " gets horrified looks .
And either way , he can keep drinking .
I 'll call this the Cynic 's Theory of Akrasia , as opposed to the Naive Theory .
I used to think it was plausible .
Now that I think about it a little more , I find it meaningless .
Here 's what changed my mind .
What part of the mind , exactly , prefers a socially unacceptable activity ( like drinking whiskey or browsing Reddit ) to an acceptable activity ( like having a wife and kids , or studying ) ?
The conscious mind ?
As Bill said in his comment , it does n't seem like it works this way .
I 've had akrasia myself , and I never consciously think " Wow , I really like browsing Reddit ... but I 'll trick everyone else into thinking I 'd rather be studying so I get more respect .
Ha ha !
The fools will never see it coming ! "
No , my conscious mind fully believes that I would rather be studying2 .
And this even gets reflected in my actions .
I 've tried anti-procrastination techniques , both successfully and unsuccessfully , without ever telling them to another living soul .
People trying to diet do n't take out the cupcakes as soon as no one else is looking ( or , if they do , they feel guilty about it ) .
This is as it should be .
It is a classic finding in evolutionary psychology : the person who wants to fool others begins by fooling themselves .
Some people even call the conscious mind the " public relations officer " of the brain , and argue that its entire point is to sit around and get fooled by everything we want to signal .
As Bill said , " believing the signals , even if untrue , makes the signals more effective . "
Now we have enough information to see why the Cynic 's Theory is equivalent to the Naive Theory .
The Naive Theory says that you really want to stop drinking , but some force from your unconscious mind is hijacking your actions .
The Cynic 's
Theory says that you really want to keep drinking , but your conscious mind is hijacking your thoughts and making you think otherwise .
In both cases , the conscious mind determines the signal and the unconscious mind determines the action .
The only difference is which preference we define as " real " and worthy of sympathy .
In the Naive Theory , we sympathize with the conscious mind , and the problem is the unconscious mind keeps committing contradictory actions .
In the Cynic 's Theory , we symapthize with the unconscious mind , and the problem is the conscious mind keeps sending out contradictory signals .
The Naive say : find some way to make the unconscious mind stop hijacking actions !
The Cynic says : find some way to make the conscious mind stop sending false signals !
So why prefer one theory over the other ?
Well , I 'm not surprised that it 's mostly economists who support the Cynic 's Theory .
Economists are understandably interested in revealed preferences3 , because revealed preferences are revealed by economic transactions and are the ones that determine the economy .
It 's perfectly reasonable for an economist to care only about those and dimiss any other kind of preference as a red herring that has to be removed before economic calculations can be done .
Someone like a philosopher , who is more interested in thought and the mind , might be more susceptible to the identify - with - conscious - thought Naive Theory .
But notice how the theory you choose also has serious political implications4 .
Consider how each of the two ways of looking at the problem would treat this example :
A wealthy liberal is a member of many environmental organizations , and wants taxes to go up to pay for better conservation programs .
However , she can't bring herself to give up her gas - guzzling SUV , and is usually too lazy to sort all her trash for recycling .
I myself throw my support squarely behind the Naive Theory .
Conscious minds are potentially rational5 , informed by morality , and qualia - laden .
Unconscious minds are n't , so who cares what they think ?
1 : Caplan says that the lack of interest in Stickk offers support for the Cynic 's Theory , but I do n't see why it should , unless we believe the mental balance of power should be different when deciding whether to use Stickk than when deciding whether to do anything else .
Caplan also suggests in another article that he has never experienced procrastination as akrasia .
Although I find this surprising , I do n't find it absolutely impossible to believe .
His mind may either be exceptionally well - integrated , or it may send signals differently .
It seems within the range of normal human mental variation .
2 : Of course , I could be lying here , to signal to you that I have socially acceptable beliefs .
I suppose I can only make my point if you often have the same experience , or if you 've caught someone else fighting akrasia when they did n't know you were there .
3 : Even the term " revealed preferences " imports this value system , as if the act of buying something is a revelation that drives away the mist of the false consciously believed preferences .
4 : For a real - world example of a politically - charged conflict surrounding the question of whether we should judge on conscious or unconscious beliefs , see Robin 's post Redistribution Is n't About Sympathy and my reply .
5 : Differences between the conscious and unconscious mind should usually correspond to differences between the goals of a person and the " goals " of the genome , or else between subgoals important today and subgoals important in the EEA .
Kevin : Imagine that I let you borrow $ 50 , but in exchange for my generosity , you promise to pay me back the $ 50 with an extra $ 10 in interest .
To make sure you pay me back , I take your Charizard Pokémon card as collateral …
Let ’s say that the Charizard is worth $ 50 , so in case you decide to not return my money , at least I ’ll have something that ’s worth what I loaned out .
But one day , people realize that Pokémon is stupid and everyone decides that the cards are overvalued .
That ’s right — everybody turned twelve on the same day !
Now your Charizard is only worth , say , $ 25 .
At the same time , you ’re having trouble paying back the $ 60 you owe me .
So what would you rather do : try and pay me back the $ 60 or just default and give me your $ 25 Charizard ?
Olivia : I ’d give you the Charizard .
Kevin : Exactly .
Who would n’t ?
Now , the bank — I mean me — has lost $ 25 when I expected to make $ 10 .
What ’s the lesson here ?
Olivia : Pokémon is dumb
The return of the slideshow : Nikon camera that doubles as a projector
Squinting at the tiny screen , you can barely make out your friend 's silhouette against the sunset .
For all its technological brilliance , the digital camera is not the ideal platform to be shown someone 's holiday photos .
One company believes it has the answer .
Nikon has created a digital camera with a built - in projector to display a succession of images on any flat surface , such as a screen or even a bare wall .
The camera goes on sale in the UK next month priced at £ 399.99
For many , the concept will bring back memories of the slide projector - and perhaps with it the tradition of returning from sunny climes to bore friends and family with a lengthy show of stills .
The Coolpix S1000 pj will come with a remote control and projector stand for the full slideshow experience .
It will enable a new generation to sit huddled in the darkened living room , and regaled with foot - high images of elderly relatives at the seaside .
Only this time they will be of television quality , with sound and special effects added .
[ caption ]
And there 'll be liitle need to change slide reels as the the makers say the camera can project 220 successive projector shots or an hours worth of movie footage .
Depending on how near to the screen the camera is placed , the pictures can be displayed from five inches to 40 inches in size .
It can project up to 6ft 6ins away .
And there will be no danger of slides being damaged , blurred or overexposed .
Like most modern cameras , the S1000 pj automatically corrects strong shadows , while the lens is designed to reduce vibration .
The camera boasts a picture quality of 12.1 megapixels .
Those worried about embarrassing poolside snaps being blown up in high - definition quality on the living room wall may be slightly reassured to learn that it also has a ' skin softening ' feature which ' smoothes out uneven skin tones ' .
Despite including a projector the Nikon S1000 pj is impressively compact
It also features a ' macro mode ' for those all - important close - ups with which you can embarrass your children .
It lets you capture details as close as three centimetres away .
The camera , which goes on sale sale in the UK next month priced at £ 399.99 , will also be able to shoot a continuous video of up to one hour .
Other manufacturers are expected to quickly follow suit .
Mike Pekelharing , of Nikon , said : ' It 's packed with everything you need to take amazing photos as well as show off your pictures .
' Sharing photos or videos has never been so easy , or so much fun . '
Eighties revival :
The old slide projectors with carousels were heavier and more cumbersome machines

The executioner walks into the venerable , dusty , fin - de - siècle office of the Association of 21 December .
The organisation , so named to commemorate the first day of the December 1989 revolt in Bucharest , is suing the Romanian government for the truth about the still opaque mysteries of the revolution which overthrew communism in Romania 20 years ago .
As with many of the small people who make epic history , the executioner 's story emerges slowly .
Dorin - Marian Cirlan is one of the three - man firing squad which killed the megalomanic communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena on Christmas Day 1989 .
Cirlan emptied the magazine clipped to his Kalashnikov AK - 47 into the couple 's bodies from near point - blank range , after they had been captured by revolutionaries .
The moments after the execution were famously televised , broadcast to Romania and the world as evidence that an era had ended , that the most turbulent and violent of the revolutions which collapsed communism across Eastern Europe during 1989 had achieved its immediate objective .
But the Romanian revolution was not what it seemed - that is , a popular revolt against the dictator in which the people were joined by the army .
Ever since , the man who apparently led the insurgency and succeeded Ceausescu , Ion Iliescu , has frequently been accused of staging more of a coup d'état than an uprising .
As the strange story of Dorin - Marian Cirlan suggests .
I met Cirlan in May .
Dressed in a black bomber jacket , blue polo shirt , black trousers and polished shoes , Cirlan has a thick set , stern , determined face .
" I sat on Ceausescu 's body after killing him , because there was nowhere else to sit in the helicopter .
It was probably more comfortable than the seats , " he told me .
" He was still warm , and his blood spread on to my camouflaged trousers .
The armed forces never paid to have them cleaned . "
Will this , then , turn out to be the narrative of a professional but impenitent ( if not callous ) paratrooper carrying out instructions ?
Not at all .
" Yes , I did feel as though I had played a part in history .
I knew all about the French revolution , the guillotine , and felt that I had done something similar .
But I was not comfortable with it .
The trial lasted 1 minute and 44 seconds , the execution less than 10 minutes .
I had been trained as a commando to fight for this country .
Ceausescu was my supreme commander - in - chief , and I had been trained to protect him at all costs , not to kill him . "
Cirlan 's narrative ploughs its remarkable furrow for the first time in English ( he has written a book in Romanian ) , with the military precision one would expect from an elite paratrooper .
And yet it ends with the plea of a man curiously isolated from a society supposedly now liberated from the dictator he killed .
For two years , in the late 1980s , Cirlan had been a member of an elite paratroop commando unit .
On the morning of Christmas Day 1989 his unit was told that volunteers were needed for a " special mission " categorised Zero Degrees - " which signified that one did not know that one was going to return " .
Eight commandos were flown in two helicopters , " commando style " , says Cirlan , " at 150 k ph , but only 15 - 30 metres above the ground , so as to fly below radar , and in a zig - zag motion . "
The destination was a stretch of land near the Steaua Bucharest football stadium .
" We were met by a convoy of an APC [ armoured personnel carrier ] and several cars carrying senior officials and General Victor Stanculescu , whom I knew from the TV was the revolutionary deputy minister of defence , and whom I had seen on television as part of the National Salvation Front . "
The helicopters then flew on to Tirgoviste , " escorted by a strong air defence - five helicopters in all , flying only 10 metres above the ground , told to show the yellow scarf , signifying ' Heroes without Honour ' .
Then we landed . "
Cirlan hunches forward , elbows on knees , kneading his hands together .
His shape would n't get him into the paras now , but you can tell that two decades ago , this was a man of imposing physique .
" First , General Stanculescu said he needed four people from each helicopter , and that what would happen would be done without badges , and we must be armed with grenades and knives as well as our weapons .
' My dear comrades , ' he said , ' I have trusted the paratroopers long , and now I trust your commitment to the revolution . '
He said there would be ' an exceptional military tribunal ' to 'apply the law of the National Salvation Front , to try and condemn the couple who have done terrible things to the Romanian people .
Do we proceed together to the end ? ' he asked , and I thought : ' What end ? '
" Then the general said : ' If the sentence is death , are you ready to carry out that sentence ? '
We all , like a choir , replied ' Yes . '
He was unhappy with that , and asked anyone willing to carry out the sentence to step forward .
We all stepped forward .
Then he appointed three of us , a captain , me [ a petty officer ] and a sergeant .
We were ordered to get everyone out of the building , guard the door of the courtroom and kill anyone who tried to break in .
The captain was shown the place where Ceausescu would be killed if he was given the death sentence , and we were told to empty a whole magazine of ammunition into him . "
Ceausescu arrived at the court and , according to Cirlan , he panicked : " He did n't know who we were .
' Are you Romanian ? ' he asked .
' We are with the general , ' I answered .
We had to stand guard outside the trial , but could hear perfectly well .
When the sentence was read , it was a terrible moment .
' Appeal in 10 days , ' said the voice , ' sentence to be carried out immediately . '
I was about to kill the president , but I told myself to act without thinking , especially from any judicial point of view .
General Stanculescu took a stand .
He ordered us to tie them up , take them to the wall , shoot him and then her . "
Then the Ceausescus appeared .
" They were whining like children , " Cirlan remembers .
" ' We can't be killed like dogs ! ' he cried , and looked at us .
' We 're going to be killed like dogs ! '
It was a hard moment for all of us .
Then she said : ' If you are going to kill us , then out of respect for our love for each other , do n't kill him and make me watch .
At least let me die along with my husband . '
And the general ordered : ' Take her to the wall with him . ' "
At one point , Cirlan said , " It was so hard to look at them , we turned away .
They were placed against the wall .
We knew who they were , but I suddenly saw this human face - he looked so puzzled by it all .
Then he looked straight into my eyes and shouted : ' Long live the socialist republic of Romania !
History will avenge me !'
And he started singing a fragment of the ' Internationale ' .
That is when the order came , and all three of us fired , from the hip .
We shot him while he was singing .
We shot them from a distance of one metre , maybe even 50 cm .
We 'd only emptied half the magazines before they were pinned to the wall , dead .
The impact of bullets into her was so strong that she went like this ... " and Cirlan , seated until now , gets up to demonstrate how Elena Ceausescu was blown diagonally and upwards against the wall .
He then returns to the black faux - leather sofa .
" We were like robots , " he said .
" We did everything very quickly .
Ever since then all I have wanted to do is to study philosophy and law .
To understand what I did , legally .
I was a petty officer obeying the orders of a general , who killed a man after a fake trial .
I killed Ceausescu on Christmas Day , but the decree setting up the court was signed on the 27th , by which time he had already been dead for two days .
Only that night did they show the bodies on television .
None of our movements that day left any paper trail at all .
The man I killed was the dictator they all said they hated , but they ostracised me forever afterwards , all the same .
Iliescu does not like me , the press blamed me in some way for the unfairness of the trial and for firing all my magazine .
The politicians kept their distance from the whole thing , and I was sacked by the Ministry of Defence in 1998 . "
The fixed , recollective expression in Cirlan 's face changes .
He becomes sorrowful in a defeated , baffled way .
" I am now a lawyer , but cut off from society , living on the edges , a black sheep who gives legal advice .
And it is a gift of God that I am alive to tell the tale . "
With that , former Petty Officer Cirlan , the tyrant 's executioner , rises , shakes hands , and leaves the office .
To shake the hand of Cordruta Cruceanu outside the national gallery of art in Bucharest is to do so across 20 years since we first met .
In 1989 , she was a curator in the museum while a battle raged among the paintings .
One day , as we walked the gallery floors , the view across the cobbled square through a large opening blown in the elegant wall by an artillery shell was of tanks grinding over charred debris , nervous young soldiers - with flowers placed in their helmets by the people - returning the occasional crack of sniper fire , and crowds come to gawp at the fallen fortresses of the Ceausescu regime .
It looked like war from another time , on black and white newsreel ; a week had passed since Ceausescu 's execution , but it had taken days to subdue the stench of gunsmoke , shellfire and scorched masonry .
Beneath our feet as we walked were the incinerated remains of the museum 's inventory - paintings were pitted with bullet holes , the canvases strewn like corpses in a morgue .
" As you can see , there was heavy fighting here , the Byzantine room , " Cruceanu said .
" And a lot of shots were fired in the 19th - century national school , where we think our army had come in .
But the Securitate [ Ceausescu 's secret police ] must have come through the forbidden corridors from the palace , or a skylight " ... and we ascended to the third storey ... " so that most of the shooting was here among the European paintings , of which I 'm the curator . "
My notebook recorded that there was damage to Boccaccini's Samson Breaking the Pillars of the Temple , Gentilleschi's Mother and Child and Rembrandt 's A Man Begging the Forgiveness of Esther .
At the end of the gallery was a piano , lightly coated in snow which had drifted in through the holes punched by shellfire and the top of a dome that had been blown off .
Cruceanu raised the lid and played a few notes of , I think , Bach .
" It works ! " she said .
" So you see , there is hope . "
In May , Cruceanu and I met again , in spring sunshine .
Now 55 , she told me that the gallery held an exhibition of the damaged paintings in 2000 , but of the events of 1989 she said , " We still do n't really know the full truth , and I wonder if we ever will .
There are too many people alive in whose interests it is that we never know who was fighting who , and why .
What we do know , though , is that it was all theatre , to a degree - that it was staged . "
Although the Romanian revolution was the most dramatic of the insurgencies against communism that swept across and united Europe 20 years ago , it was also the most mysterious , dichotomous and duplicitous .
At the time , the world watched a mass uprising against the Ceausescu regime : first in Timisoara , then memorably at a mass rally Ceausescu held in Bucharest , where the crowd began to jeer and boo him .
Shortly afterwards , he and his wife Elena were executed .
However , it took some time before the revolutionary leadership under Ceausescu 's challenger , Iliescu , could subdue the Securitate loyal to the tyrant .
The violence was terrible and the deaths , over many days before and after the execution , remain incalculable to this day .
No one doubts that there was a popular and bold revolution , on the streets , by the people .
But what is still not explained is who was manipulating them , and why .
Who was shooting at who ?
And what were Iliescu , his faction in the communist party , and generals loyal to him doing behind the scenes ?
Lingering still , after two decades , is the appalling notion that the fighting was fabricated and that the revolution was a facade .
" Of all the hundreds of speeches Iliescu made and has made since then , " recalls Cordruta Cruceanu , " the one that sticks in my mind was when he said : ' In a country like Romania , it was impossible to have a revolution , so it had to be staged . '
That is the closest he has ever come to admitting what almost everybody believes , or knows , to have happened . "
The fall of Ceausescu was announced , unforgettably , by Romania 's leading actor , Ion Caramitru , on television from the national TV headquarters , which had been occupied by the democratic revolutionaries , of whom he and the dissident writer Mircea Dinescu , with whom he appeared on screen , were the most prominent .
I remember days and nights in the TV centre - which was under fire from what were thought to be loyalists to Ceausescu - meeting Caramitru during the endless and open debates about the future of the nation and what to broadcast about it , in a mood which seemed to combine 1968 with something more fearsome .
Caramitru has since become a screen star and one of Europe 's greatest Shakespearean stage leads - notably Hamlet and Lear - but he never left politics : he left Iliescu 's National Salvation Front when it turned itself into the ruling political party , and was minister of culture in the rival coalition government between 1996 and 2000 .
Last month , after a striking performance of Edward III at the national theatre of Romania , of which he is the director , Caramitru invited me up for wine and reflection in his splendid , book - lined office .
" I was gesticulating with the officer of an APC after two days on the streets - 21 and 22 of December , " he recalls , " and asked him if he was the commander .
The officer replied , weeping like a child , that if Ceausescu had fled , we , the people , must be the commander , so that ' You must be my commander now . '
The whole thing was surreal :
I said : ' OK , let 's take your APC to the television station , then , ' which we did - the people marching behind - and went in .
We got the transmission organised and then we made the announcement : ' You are free , Ceausescu is gone . '
" There had been a revolution by the people , but the people had been tricked , " he says .
" We were romantics , we had no relationship with those in power .
Within a year , it was beyond doubt that one faction had simply removed another faction , probably in direct contact with Moscow , where Gorbachev had realised that Ceausescu 's system would implode .
The institutions which had run the country remained intact , albeit with another name .
Tragically , more people were killed after the execution of Ceausescu than before .
If I were Iliescu and believed in God , I 'd fear God 's judgment regarding the dead . "
The falsehood bequeathed a strange hybrid : a country which embraced the capitalist market system , but was still run by the old guard .
The legacy is reflected in a report last year by the European Union , which admitted Romania only to label its new member the EU 's second most corrupt country , after Bulgaria .
There was an attempt to clean up the system , by the current president , Traian Basescu , but such was the resistance from parliament that , as one of the Justice Ministry 's assistants during that period , Laura Stefanescu , puts it , " Our only victory was that there was no defeat , and that the immunity of the political class did not become even stronger .
Romania , " she said , " is like the international banking system , throughout an entire society : rules exist only for honest people ; there are no rules for those who are corrupt . "
The corruption results not only from the falsehood of the " revolution " , says Mattei Paulin , an investment banker raised abroad but who repatriated after 1989 , but in " the west 's complicity in the privatisations " that followed .
" Before 1989 , there were various factions within the communist system , " Paulin told me .
" Now , after what I call a ' regicide ' rather than a coup d'état , let alone a revolution , those same factions exist in what appears to be a market system , but is in reality a rotten state which sold off such assets as the national bank and Petrom [ the state oil company ] and its substantial drilling interests for a fraction of their value , to companies from France , Austria and other countries , simply to protect their own political positions .
The western powers and corporations happily and knowingly played along . "
The iconic flag of 1989 , the Romanian tricolour of blue , yellow and red with a hole cut where the communist symbol was , still flies in the magnificent hallway of the offices of the Association of 21 December , its old wooden walls covered with pictures of the burning art gallery , other unforgettable scenes from those days , and portraits of the dead .
From here , Doru Maries 's association has been suing the Romanian government ( and now does so through the European Court in Strasbourg ) for a truthful account of what happened in 1989 .
A former professional footballer , Maries was among those in the democratic opposition who occupied the Politburo building as Ceausescu fled it ( it was on the balcony of the Politburo that Iliescu appeared to the crowds ) .
Maries was among those who grabbed a gun as he entered , only to offer it back after he realised what was happening .
" A group was at one point sent down to the basement to confront Securitate ' terrorists ' , " he said .
" Another was sent with the same order , but down another staircase .
They ended up shooting at each other .
What we are claiming is that there were no ' terrorists ' , that the whole thing was fabricated , and the deaths unnecessary . "
Maries produces documents filed in court , which he says show Iliescu ordering the communist party apparatus to continue collecting subscriptions , and for its officials to remain in place .
" For 20 years , " he said , " we have faced a wall of silence , and continue to do so . "
When the democratic movement in Romania began to sense that things were not as they seemed , demonstrations against Iliescu took to the streets .
Between early 1990 and 1992 they were routinely attacked by what became known as the mineriada - violent interventions by coal miners from the Jiu Valley .
The miners were mobilised by union leader Miron Cozma , who was ferociously loyal to Iliescu , and ostensibly to the men he represented .
On one occasion , miners ransacked the headquarters of conservative parties ; on another , they cracked the skulls of demonstrating students .
Much has been written on Cozma 's escapades , but little on the duality of pride and shame in the story of the Romanian miners , who always held a special place in communist iconography , even though the drab apartment blocks in which they lived were not allowed chimneys in case they were tempted to warm themselves with what they mined .
There was another minerad in 1999 , this time in defence of miners ' jobs , as the pitheads began to close .
The impact of pit closures on the Jiu Valley is catastrophic , and a parable of the price Romania paid for liberty 20 years ago , when it exchanged the iron fist of communism for the ravages of the market .
Or , as some would argue , combined the worst of both .
Miron Cozma was jailed for his part in the miners ' demonstrations against the pit closures , but pardoned by the re-elected Iliescu and released in 2004 .
Today , his brother , Tiberiu , is the deputy leader of the miners ' union .
" What we have seen , " Tiberiu said , " is the politically motivated destruction of the Romanian coal industry , as agreed between the government and the IMF in 1997 .
When you were last here , 47,000 men worked in these mines .
There are now less than 11,000 . "
In an upper region of Vulcan called Dallas ( out of mockery ) , sewage runs in the open , children play in filth and squalor , idle families crowd the balconies of the peeling apartment blocks , where the lifts have been jammed and used for storage .
Ion Nelu tries to provide for his wife and three children .
Laid off from the mine in 1997 , he does this , he says , " by maybe finding scrap metal , in the closed mines , or some coal to steal .
Or else by foraging around the forest for mushrooms to sell . "
To the north is Aninoasa , an entirely dead town since the pit was closed .
As we drive through , a group of men are loading scrap metal , baths and toilets ransacked from the closed mine and empty houses on to a truck .
" Do n't stop , " I 'm told .
" Very dangerous . "
Watching from a bench is Szebiges Lajos , who once worked in the mine .
" It was always hard , " he says .
" Before , you had the secret police on your back , but at least we had work .
Now , absolutely nothing .
Why would anyone want to close down a perfectly good mine ? "
Coal now comes to Romania from Russia , the Ukraine and South Africa .
Illie Martin , the former manager at the Vulcan mine , now runs a company with a contract to clean the town .
He said he had tried to move from management to lead the union , but was elbowed out .
At the other end of the Carpathian mountains , it is a similar story .
Behind the Danube port of Galati stands what was once an awesome steelworks .
In 1989 , the state - run Sidex was the largest steelworks in Europe , producing the widest range of specialised steel on the continent .
The site now belongs to Lakshmi Mittal , the world 's biggest steel magnate and Britain 's richest man .
According to the leaders of Solidarity , a new , independent miners union , Mittal is " amputating the factory , limb by limb " .
It was for " downsizing " like this that Mittal 's headquarters in Luxembourg was besieged by rioting steelworkers last month .
" At its peak , Sidex employed 40,000 people , " said Ilinca Bianocu , the female president of Solidarity .
" When Mittal bought the works there were 27,000 .
Now we are down to 12,500 .
The government sold it for nothing , and now the new owners claim it is not competitive , so they will not invest , " she said .
" And I wonder why .
The demand for steel increases , the price of steel rises , but the jobs decrease .
We see no reason to run down this pearl of Romania , unless it is to move the entire industry to India and China . "
Back in Bucharest , after walking through the now completely refurbished art gallery , Cordruta Cruceanu chooses a café she likes in a restored building from Romania 's great inter-war days of cultural proximity to Paris .
" They have managed to do some lovely things to the old cafés , " she observed , recalling how she used to wander through the ruins of this now smart place to admire a statue of a dolphin .
Now , though , " I work differently , " she said , " to try and contest the values in this country which have become , frankly , screwed up .
I 'm involved in a project in Sofia , getting children away from their computer screens and into the city , to look at how they relate to it , to what in the Renaissance was called the Piazza , the urban space , physically , artistically , socially . "
Cruceanu believes that " with hindsight , Romania was more vulnerable than any other communist country to the myth of the west as material paradise , to mall culture and measurement of success by what kind of mobile phone you have .
It 's particularly strong here , perhaps because it all happened so suddenly , even to the educated classes .
A lot of damage has been done , both to Romania and to the west , as we now see in this crisis : because the west began to believe some of our illusions about itself - in our false expectations of what it seemed to promise , back then in 1989 .
Which feels at once like another lifetime , but yesterday . "
Musings on a summer ’s day
I ’ve been studying politics a long time now , and there are still lots of things about it that at some level I just do n’t get .
I ’m not saying that I have no idea why these things occur or suggesting that they are totally inexplicable .
I ’m just saying that I still find them a bit baffling .
So I made a list , and thought I ’d share a few of them .
Maybe some of you will share my confusion .
1 . I ’ve never really understood why plenty of smart people think the United States still needs thousands of nuclear weapons ( or ever did ) .
I ’m familiar with the abstract theology of nuclear weapons policy and I do n’t favor total nuclear disarmament , but the case for an arsenal of more than a few hundred weapons eludes me .
See here or here for convincing arguments to this effect .
2 . I ’m still puzzled by why Americans are so willing to spend money on ambitious overseas adventures , and yet so reluctant to pay taxes for roads , bridges , better schools , and health care here in the United States .
My fellow Americans , where ’s your sense of entitlement ?
And frankly , I ’m also surprised that the U.S. armed forces have n’t put up more resistance to the seemingly open - ended missions they keep getting handed by ambitious politicians .
I can think of various reasons why they remain willing to make these sacrifices ( it ’s a volunteer force , there ’s a long tradition of civilian authority , our soldiers , sailors and airman are dedicated patriots , the top brass are often chosen for their political malleability , etc. ) , but it still surprises me .
3 . I do n’t understand why many people think invoking God is a compelling justification for their particular policy preferences , and why they assume that this move is a trump card that ends all discussion .
The idea that Jehovah , Jesus , Allah , Odin , or Whomever gave some people permanent title to some patch of land , dictated how men and women should relate to each other for all eternity , or provided the incontestable answer to ANY public policy question is simply beyond me .
Yet it remains a common feature of political discourse at home and abroad .
Weird .
4 . I ’m equally baffled by when someone invokes “ history ” to justify a territorial claim and assumes that this basis is unchallengeable .
This view assumes that sovereignty over some area is infinitely inheritable ( no matter what has happened in the interim ) , ignores the fact the borders have changed a lot over time , and further assumes that there ’s only one version of history that matters .
I understand why Serbs invoke the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 to justify their current claims to control that region , why Israelis and Palestinians invoke different readings of history to justify their positions on Jerusalem , or why certain Asian states invoke different historical claims to assorted rocks in the South China Sea — they are all looking for some way to persuade others to let them have what they want .
What ’s odd is that people who make such claims tend to think their view is simply incontestable and other equally valid historical claims are n’t worth paying attention to .
You ’re entitled to your version of history , I suppose , but why do you assume that anyone is going to be persuaded by it ?
5 . I do not understand why Americans are so susceptible to the self - interested testimony of foreigners who want to embroil us in conflicts with some foreign government that they happen to dislike .
A case in point would be Iraqi exile Ahmad Chalabi , who sold a lot of fairy tales to the Bush administration prior to the 2003 invasion .
As Machiavelli ( himself an exile ) warned in The Discourses : “ How vain the faith and promises of men who are exiles from their own country .
..
Such is their extreme desire to return to their homes that they naturally believe many things that are not true , and add many others on purpose ; so that with what they really believe and what they say they believe , they will fill you with hopes to that degree that if you attempt to act on them , you will incur a fruitless expense , or engage in an undertaking that will involve you in ruin . ”
This sort of thing goes back to the Peloponnesian Wars ( at least ) , and you ’d think we ’d have learned to be more skeptical by now .
6 . I certainly do n’t get the business model that informs the content of the Wall Street Journal ‘s op - ed page .
The rest of the newspaper is an excellent news source , with reportage that is often of very high quality .
The editorial page , by contrast , is often a parody of right - wing lunacy : the last refuge of discredited neoconservatives , supply - siders , and other extremists .
Do the Journal ’s editors really think democracy is best served by offering the public such a one - sided diet of opinion ?
Do they feel no responsibility to offer a wider range of views to their readers , as the rival Financial Times does ?
More importantly , would n’t their market share ( and profits ) be increased if they offered a more diverse range of views ?
I ’m equally puzzled by the op - ed page of the Washington Post : what ’s the business model that says cornering the market on tired neoconservative pundits is the best way to attract new readers ?
( FP is now owned by the Post corporation too , I might add , but anyone who follows this Web site knows that there is n’t any discernible party line here . )
7 . A related point : I ca n’t figure out why newspapers are n’t hiring more bloggers to write columns for them on a regular basis .
I started reading blogs because the stuff I read on the web tends to be smarter , funnier , better researched , and more entertainingly written than the pablum that appears on the op - ed pages of most newspapers .
A lot of bloggers seem to produce more material too ; frankly , doing a column twice a week sounds almost leisurely compared to what some bloggers pound out .
There are dull bloggers and some excellent mainstream print pundits , of course , but I ’m amazed that more bloggers are n’t breaking into the so - called big - time mainstream media .
Probably another good reason why newspapers are dying .
8 . In an era where the United States is facing BIG problems at home or abroad , it is both puzzling and disheartening to observe the amount of ink and airspace devoted to the Skip Gates arrest , Michael Jackson ’s demise , or the “ birther ” controversy .
But then I did n’t get the Princess Di phenomenon or the whole reality - TV thing either .
9 . I do n’t understand why academics defend the institution of tenure so energetically , and then so rarely use it for its intended purpose ( i.e. , to permit them to tackle big and / or controversial subjects without worrying about losing their jobs )
When it comes to politics at least , the Ivory Tower seems increasingly populated by methodologically sophisticated sheep .
10 . I ’m both amused and annoyed by the highly intrusive security procedures that now exist at airports , which are almost certainly not cost - effective .
The key to preventing another 9/11 was n’t to have us all removing our shoes or carrying shampoo in a plastic bag ; the key to preventing another 9/11 - style attack was to put locks on the cockpit doors , so terrorists could n’t gain control of the airplane and turn it into a weapon .
( A smarter Middle East policy would n’t hurt either ) .
I ’ll concede that additional screening is probably preventing a few additional incidents , but I question whether the extra expense and inconvenience is ultimately worth it .
Alas , nobody is going to relax those procedures now , because they ’d worry about being blamed the next time someone managed to blow up an airliner .
I understand the CYA impetus that will keep these procedures in place from now until doomsday , but the irrationality of it all annoys me every time I fly .

The men were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last four years Four families of servicemen killed in Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq and Afghanistan are to sue the Ministry of Defence , the BBC has learned .
They claim the vehicles are too lightly armoured to cope with the weapons used against them and that the MoD was negligent in allowing their use .
However , the MoD maintains the vehicles are vital equipment and suitable for the jobs they must perform .
Since 2003 , some 37 UK personnel have been killed while using the vehicles .
Human rights
The lightly - armoured Snatch Land Rovers are used on operations where troops need quick land transport .
They are fortified with armour to offer protection against explosions and ballistics , but have been criticised for offering insufficient protection against roadside bombs .
The Snatch Land Rover was specifically designed for Northern Ireland Last year , the then Defence Secretary , John Hutton , ruled out a public inquiry into their use and announced plans to spend £ 700 m on new , upgraded vehicles .
The families are claiming the MoD 's failure to provide adequate protection was a breach of their sons ' human rights , as well as claiming negligence .
They say last month 's Court of Appeal ruling that the Human Rights
Act can apply to the battlefield supports their cases .
Those taking action are the families of Pte Lee Ellis , from Manchester , who died in Amara in Iraq in Feb 2006 ; Marine Gary Wright , of Stirlingshire , killed in Afghanistan in October 2006 ; L / Cpl Kirk Redpath , of Essex , killed in Iraq in August 2007 ; and Pte Phillip Hewett , of Tamworth , also killed in Iraq two years earlier .
The lawyers acting for them say they expect other claims will be brought in the future .
The Ministry of Defence confirmed four compensation claims had been received over the past 14 months following deaths involving Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A department spokesman said : " The MoD pays compensation wherever there is a liability to do so .
In these cases we remain profoundly aware of the enduring grief of the four families who lost their loved ones in combat . "

This is exactly what I was talking about when I compared the look and feel of the original screenshots to something out of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Planescape setting - a mixture of steampunk and fantasy that gives the game a completely otherworldly look and feel .
The main character , Lex , has undergone a redesign in both his bulky human form and his lithe alien form , which he switches between as he explores the twin realms of Night and Day , and the environments themselves are places I definitely want to explore .
The voice over is similarly intriguing , with the final words giving me chills : " One little slip of your knife , and a lifetime of pain can just drain away . "
Shivers .

The growing protest against KUT - FM 's decision to cut back the shifts of longtime disc jockeys Paul Ray and Larry Monroe is shaping up as something of a last stand for the public radio station 's old guard disc jockeys .
" They have n't even begun to hear from us , " said musician Cleve Hattersley , co-founder of seminal local band Greezy Wheels , who is spearheading the protest .
His supporters , who include former Mayor Lee Cooke and 570 Facebook fans , have been calling station board members , staging meetings , and enlisting the support of musicians such as Joe Ely , Marcia Ball , and Toni Price .
" We 're going to raise such a stink , we 're going to get [ Ray and Monroe ] back , " Hattersley said .
But they 're battling what station insiders say is a long - running effort to marginalize and push out the station 's core group of ol ' record spinners , the holdovers from a different era – Monroe , Ray , and morning host John Aielli , in particular – who have been part of KUT for 30 years and remain the station 's most recognizable personalities .
Although management denies it , their roles have been steadily sliced and diced under general manager Stewart Vanderwilt , who took over KUT in 2000 and began implementing his vision for a modern public radio station .
In the latest moves , last month the station cut the bulk of Monroe and Ray 's evening shifts , replacing their shows on Tuesday through Thursday evenings with a music program hosted by Assistant Music Director Matt Reilly , a former disc jockey and producer at Austin adult album alternative station KGSR - FM .
Ray will continue with Twine Time on Saturday nights , and Monroe will remain as host of Blue Monday , but they were also dropped from the weeknight overnight slots , replaced by a syndicated show , Undercurrents .
Ray and Monroe , both in their 60s , are now paid for less than 10 hours a week and face the potential loss of their health benefits , according to a station source .
In the budget for the station 's next fiscal year , set to begin Sept.
1 , Aielli is also slotted as a part - time employee , after the station dumped his Web - only program , Aielli Unleashed .
( Presumably , he 's now back on the leash . )
KUT management cites a variety of reasons for the latest cutbacks , including the need to create " more continuity between our daytime and evening music programming " and a desire to " serve a broader listener base . "
The audience after midnight is " almost non-existent " and the station is looking to save money , says associate general manager and director of broadcast and content Hawk Mendenhall .
Two months ago , Vander­wilt said the station was expecting a 2 % increase in revenue this year , but now management is planning for a $ 550,000 drop in revenue .
Cutting Ray and Monroe 's shifts will save $ 60,000 a year , Mendenhall says .
Beyond saving a few bucks , Paul Ray 's Jazz show and Monroe 's Phil Music Program were simply not drawing the audience numbers , Mendenhall says .
" If the shows had been as successful as other music programs , " he said , " this would n't be an issue . "
Not So Eclectic
But that 's dangerous ground for the station , which still depends on public contributions from " listeners like you . "
Longtime fans of Ray , Monroe , Aielli , Jay Trachtenberg , and the station 's other unique voices may still hold on to the much - mocked notion that public radio should operate to serve the community , not as a revenue - and ratings - focused corporation .
Some insiders believe that only fear of a public relations backlash has stopped management from cutting back the older hosts sooner .
On a small scale , those fears were realized a few days after KUT announced the programming changes , when Ray was named to the Texas Radio Hall of Fame – an embarrassing twist for the station that just cut his shifts .
( Oblivious to irony , KUT sent out a press release touting the honor , although it was noticeably free of any congratulatory quotes from station management . )
To get Monroe and Ray back in a featured role , Hattersley is vowing to " go after the money , " including the station 's donors and local businesses .
( Hey , if KLBJ will dump a morning show over some bad " wetback " jokes , why not give it a try ? )
Beyond the fate of the disc jockeys , he 's asking core questions about the role of a public radio station .
" The larger issue is the homogenization of something unique to Austin , " Hattersley said .
Behind the scenes , tension has been percolating for years between the old guard and management , past and current employees say .
Aielli's Eklektikos has been steadily cut and reined in .
Some veteran employees took it as a slap in the face when former Market­place host David Brown , who is married to News Director Emily Donahue , was hired and paid $ 80,000 a year – much more than disc jockeys who had been with the station for decades – and put in charge of a program about Texas music .
More recently , Monroe and longtime host Dave Obermann disappeared from the Saturday show Folkways , and former KGSR morning host and ME - TV executive Kevin Connor was added to the show 's rotation .
( For the record , Connor 's slot may be one of the best music shows on local radio , but it has little to do with folk music . )
By all accounts , many of the veteran DJs have clashed with the station 's new music culture .
Disc jockeys are now told to play certain songs in rotation and are limited on how far they can stray from approved playlists .
Songs that " reflect the Central Texas experience " are " hand - picked , " the station 's promotional materials boast .
But most of the high rotation songs are " hand - picked " by a committee , primarily comprised of the station 's array of programming and music executives .
Aielli , Monroe , and Ray submit and review songs but generally do n't participate in the committee , station sources say .
( Ray and Monroe both declined to comment . )
Chained Melodies
Some wonder how long Aielli , who can still be heard most afternoons practicing his vocal techniques in the station 's stairwells , will stick around .
" We want him to keep doing Eklektikos as long as he wants to keep doing it , " Mendenhall said .
Some believe he is hanging on out of spite .
" Perhaps that 's Aielli 's greatest revenge , " said one former employee , who asked not to be named .
" He just wo n't go away , and he knows that irritates management . "
( Aielli is on vacation and did n't return phone calls . )
Management 's attitude toward the protests supporting Ray and Monroe could be read as dismissive .
" The community has not responded by listening to what they 're doing , " Mendenhall said .
Aielli Unleashed , which accounted for half of Aielli's job , generated only 30 downloads on any given day , he says .
" When they choose not to listen , they 're voting , " Mendenhall said .
In a letter posted on the station 's website , Vanderwilt could n't resist twisting the knife , making it clear that Ray and Monroe were not making the grade on the modern KUT .
" Unfortunately these weeknight music programs have not kept pace with KUT's or Austin 's growth , " Vanderwilt wrote .
( He also noted the producer of Undercurrents is " one of public radio's top Native American producers , " perhaps suggesting that the community should rally around KUT 's gallant support of the Native American community . )
Protesters are unlikely to shake Vanderwilt 's steely condescension , but they raise questions that the station has a tough time answering .
For example , why was KUT able to pay the disc jockeys when it had a $ 5.5 million budget three years ago , but now it has a $ 5.9 million budget and can't afford them ?
Where 's the money going ?
And why has n't management shown more respect for the station icons , who live and breathe Texas music , when the station is supposedly focusing on Texas music ?
Hattersley says the station is underestimating the irritation of KUT 's longtime supporters .
" Ninety - eight to 99 percent of the people I talk to are really pissed , " he said .
" Not just put off – pissed . "

The latest round of TV news cutbacks finds local Fox affiliate KTBC - TV eliminating seven positions , including investigative reporter Chris Coffey , producer John Crav­en , and three camera operators .

" We 're still very committed to investigative reporting . "
I have a coding example that I think generalizes to a case I see a lot in games - a couple posts ago when I talked about the knee - jerk reaction to add state or cache calculations , this is the kind of thing I 'm getting at .
Even before I was interested in functional programming I knew that duplicating data was a ripe opportunity for bugs , but it was playing around with Haskell that made me realize just how far you can go to avoid pushing state .
I think one of the reasons we tend to push state and cache calculations is because often it's a little less work to write the code in the first place .
Adding a new flag and setting it is easier than adding a new function .
A more complicated example - came across some code recently where the coder set up an stl map so he could quickly look up a few elements from a larger hierarchy of stuff .
Probably less work than writing the recursive search ; but now we have to maintain the map and the original data .
And then there 's performance .
Nobody wants somebody else to look at their code and say , " Hey , why 'd you do it this slow way ? " - particularly in game development , coders who write fast code seem to be admired , even if that code does n't work .
" He shaved 5 ms off the renderer !
Nevermind that there 's massive pop -in now ! "
Back on Spidey 2 , the designers were in charge of writing the scripts to handle fades , and because they 're not programmers by trade , it got a bit funky , though I would n't necessarily have done better at the time , because it was one of those problems that seems simple but turns out to have some issues .
Bugs kept cropping up relating to the fade curtain - it would fade to black and stay faded , or it would fade in too soon , or the like .
And we'd go in and find the script that was doing things incorrectly and fix it , and then another bug would crop up a few days later .
The curtain was an example of how state can screw one up .
You might initially set this up ( " always use the simplest possible design " ) as two functions BeginFadingOut and BeginFading
In which set a boolean is FadingOut .
But then you get two chunks of code ( not necessarily even on different threads ) that both think they need to use the curtains and you get a mess - one 'll start it fading in before the other one 's ready .
Just one example - I do n't exactly remember if this was one of the bugs or not , but it could have been - spidey might die , and respawn , but respawn in an exterior when he died in an interior , which means streaming in some new terrain data .
We might have had two scripts , one for respawning , and one for transitioning from an interior to an exterior .
Both might have called the " close curtain " function , then waited for it to close , down their work , and then opened it up .
But lo - the " respawn spidey " script is opening the curtain before the " transition " script has finished streaming in the data , and we get an ugly , visible load .
One thing we tried , then , was incrementing and decrementing a counter .
Better , and when a script failed it was because the script was clearly not using the system correctly , so it became easier to blame the scripts .
What I should have realized when we were doing these spot fixes of offending scripts was that the curtain mechanism itself was to blame .
We were effectively pushing state ... duplicating data .
Whether the curtain was fading in or out depended on the state of the game .
The curtain should have been pulling state .
It probably should have looked something like this :
bool ShouldIBeDown ( )
{
return AreWeSettingUpACutscene ( ) || IsSpideyRespawning ( ) || AreWeTransitioning ( ) ;
}
And then , what translucency to draw the curtain ( or how high to draw it , if it 's a more literal curtain ) could have been determined simply by measuring how long ShouldIBeDown had been true .
The functions that respawn Spidey or transition to different areas would wait on IsCurtainDown ( ) before doing their work .
Now , you say , " That breaks encapsulation ! "
" That creates circular dependencies ! " because the curtain is dependent on transitions and Spidey 's respawn system and the cutscene system and they 're all dependent on the curtain .
Before , the curtain was a low level service they could all just layer on top of .
I 'd say - hey , I 'd rather be conflated than buggy , and for this case it kind of makes sense for all these things to be conflated - but what about a more general situation , where some more encapsulation or layering would make sense ?
One possibility that 's C++ friendly is the curtain 's ShouldIBeDown ( ) function could be virtual .
Another possibility , not so C++ friendly , would be to use some kind of lambdas - function pointers or functors or delegates or something like that .
You could add a list of curtain - closing conditions this way .
Speaking of delegates , with Schizoid I was using delegates like candy , and one particularly bone - headed thing I did that I later stopped doing once I realized how bug - prone it was : changing delegates mid-stream .
I had some enemies that would change their minds , and tried to implement that , at first , by changing their whatDoIWantToDo delegate .
This is pushing state - the curtain problem all over again .
Instead of having one function tell the entity to do one thing by pushing one delegate and having another function tell the entity to do the other thing by pushing another delegate , I needed to put that all inside a single function if ( condition ( ) ) doOneThing ( ) else doTheOther ( ) .
If I had a rule of thumb for delegates or function pointers now , it would be - you can pass them in constructors but never change them once their object is live .

We have covered many animal topics on Listverse before , but this is our first list of badass animals .
These are not necessarily dangerous or scary creatures – but they do all have one thing in common : they are very unique .
The criteria for this list : the animal must be alive ( ie , no dinosaurs ) , and it must be awesome .
Without further ado , the ten most badass living creatures .
10 Komodo Dragon
The komodo dragon is the largest living species of lizard , growing to an average length of 2 to 3 metres ( 6.6 to 9.8 ft ) and weighing around 70 kilograms ( 150 lb ) .
Their unusual size is attributed to island gigantism , since there are no other carnivorous animals to fill the niche on the islands where they live .
Although attacks are very rare , Komodo dragons have been known to attack humans ; five people have been killed since 1974 .
One of the most recent attacks in 2007 was blamed on environmentalists who have protested to have goat sacrifices stopped .
Komodo dragons are quite smart and can recognize different humans .
They also play with toys like humans and ( for the most part ) behave tamely when in captivity .
The most amazing ( and badass ) characteristic of the komodo dragon is that the female can lay eggs that hatch without being fertilized by a male ( this is called parthenogenesis ) .
9 Giant African Land Snail
The Giant African snail is so badass and huge that in order to eradicate it , people employ the use of flame throwers .
In recent times , the land snails have been kept as pets ; however , they are illegal to possess in some countries including the United States .
The snails are easy to keep and , when bred in captivity , are unlikely to carry parasites .
They are hermaphrodites who produce both eggs and sperm but while they are able to reproduce asexually , they do usually mate with other giant snails .
Oh – and these snails love to drink beer because the yeast stimulates their growth .
8 Flying Snake
Flying snakes are mildly venomous , though they are considered harmless because their toxicity is not dangerous to humans .
But , while it may be harmless , this snake has an amazing ability which makes it both badass and horrifying .
It is able to throw itself from one place to another while slithering in the sky .
Upon reaching the end of a tree ’s branch , the snake continues moving until its tail dangles from the branch ’s end .
It then makes a J shape bend , leans forward to select the level of inclination it wishes to travel to control its flight path as well as selecting a desired landing area .
It then propels itself by thrusting its body up and away from the tree , sucking in its stomach , flaring out its ribs to turn its body in a “ pseudo concave wing ” .
Flying snakes are able to glide better than flying squirrels and other gliding animals , despite lack of limbs , wings , or any other wing - like projections , gliding through the forest and jungle it inhabits with the length being as great as 100 m .
7 Frilled Shark
The frilled shark is a living fossil shark species which looks like a hideous giant eel but is actually a shark .
On January 21 , 2007 , staff at Awashima Marine Park in Shizuoka , southwest of Tokyo , were alerted by fishermen to a ‘ strange eel - like fish with razor sharp teeth ’ .
The fish was identified as a pregnant female 1.6 m frilled shark and was captured by park staff who were concerned that the shark appeared to be unhealthy .
They took it out of the water and put it into a salt water tank where they filmed it and took pictures of it .
The shark died a few hours after capture .
The frilled shark is sometimes referred to as a living fossil partially because the species has changed little since pre-historic times .
6 Shocking Pink Dragon Millipede
Millipedes can be quite dangerous creatures , but the shocking pink dragon millipede takes the cake for its nastiness .
This millipede shoots cyanide from its mouth .
It is a spiny and toxic millipede aptly named for its bright pink color .
These adult millipedes are approximately 3 cm long and live in the open on leaf litter .
Because of their ability to create cyanide , the millipede smells like almonds ( the common odor of cyanide ) .
5 Mantis Shrimp
Despite their name , the mantis shrimps are neither shrimp nor mantises , but receive their name purely from the physical resemblance to both the praying mantis and the shrimp .
These creatures are sometimes referred to as “ thumb splitters ” because their claws are strong enough to split human appendages .
These highly intelligent creatures are often monogamous and they get to know and regularly interact with their neighbors .
The mantis shrimp also has the best eyesight in the animal world with 16 different photoreceptor types ( compared to four in humans ) .
But – what really makes these creatures badass is their ability to break out of aquariums by smashing the glass with their claws .
It has a punch stronger than a .22 calibre pistol .
4 Giant Amazonian Centipede
The Giant Amazonian Centipede can grow to over a foot in length .
It is carnivorous , feeding on lizards , frogs , birds , mice , and even bats which it can catch in mid flight !
It is also known to prey on tarantulas .
The centipede has modified claws called forcipules which curve around its head and can deliver venom into its prey .
The extremely potent venom , containing acetylcholine , histamine and serotonin ( pain mediators ) , proteases and a cardiodepressant factor , is toxic to humans and causes severe swelling , chills , fever , and weakness .
However , although bites are painful , they are unlikely to be fatal – nevertheless , this is a creature I do n’t want to come into contact with .
In the clip above you can see the centipede catching a bat in midair .
3 Cassowary
The 2007 edition of the Guinness World Records lists the cassowary as the world ’s most dangerous bird .
Normally cassowaries are very shy but when disturbed can lash out dangerously with their powerful legs .
During World War II American and Australian troops stationed in New Guinea were warned to steer clear of the birds .
They are capable of inflicting fatal injuries to an adult human .
Usually , attacks are the result of provocation .
Wounded or cornered birds are particularly dangerous .
Cassowaries , deftly using their surroundings to conceal their movements , have been known to out - flank organized groups of human predators .
Cassowaries are considered to be one of the most dangerous animals to keep in zoos , based on the frequency and severity of injuries incurred by zookeepers .

2 Humboldt Squid
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OFEDZndxqc&hl=en&fs=1&
The Humboldt squid is a large , predatory squid found in the waters of the Humboldt Current in the Eastern Pacific Ocean .
These squid hunt in packs of up to 1,200 and use their ability to rapidly change color to communicate with each other .
Scientists believe that they are highly intelligent and use complex communication .
Each tentacle is covered with suckers filled with razor sharp teeth which they use to drag their prey to their beaks .
They often approach prey quickly with all ten appendages extended forward in a cone - like shape .
Upon reaching striking distance , they will open their eight swimming and grasping arms , and extend two long tentacles covered in sharp ‘ teeth , ’ grabbing their prey and pulling it back towards a parrot - like beak , which can easily cause dramatic lacerations to human flesh .
The whole process takes place in seconds .
To make matters worse , these creatures love hunting humans – they do it very frequently and most fisherman in the area know of at least one or two friends who have been eaten by a pack of these monsters .
1 Immortal Jellyfish
The immortal jellyfish ( turritopsis nutricula ) has to be item one on this list because of the fact that it is immortal .
That is n’t hyperbole – it really is immortal .
After reaching sexual maturity , this jellyfish is able to reverse its aging process and become a polyp again .
The ability to reverse the life cycle is probably unique in the animal kingdom , and allows the jellyfish to bypass death , rendering the Turritopsis nutricula biologically immortal .
Lab tests showed that 100 % of specimens reverted to the polyp stage .

In order to understand SPOT , it 's important to note where it fits in to the consumer device form factor taxonomy .
Unlike devices that go into your laptop bag or even your pocket , SPOT broke new ground and transcended into the " invisible " space , where items like wallets and keys reside .
The invisible space is one of the most critical areas for vendors to target , since there 's a gigantic market for devices that are ubiquitous , critical and free up room for you to carry something else .
While some cell phones might be considered part of the invisible space , SPOT was one of the first digital devices that made the leap by design .
The SPOT watch had every regular watch feature you might have wanted -- alarms , timers , chronographs -- but it was also a " smart watch " : an integrated radio allowed the watch to receive information over the FM band .
After you configured your feeds online , SPOT automatically updated to display local weather , news headlines , stock information ( with trends and graphs ) , MSN instant messages , movie times , sports scores and other data .
Users could send messages directly to your watch , Outlook would sync your calendar so SPOT could automatically remind you of appointments ahead , and there no need to re-set SPOT for daylight savings time or when traveling to a new city , since the watch picked up the local times automatically .
SPOT also had some very cool custom watch faces , which ranged from the whimsical to the cute to the downright cool .
In short , Microsoft took the concept of watch and turned it into watch plus .
Does it work ?
Yes .
Did it succeed ?
No .
Here 's why .
SPOT demonstrated software 's ability to transform already useful objects into devices that alter our everyday lives .
Michael Gartenberg is vice president of strategy and analysis at Interpret , LLC .
His weblog can be found at gartenblog.
net , and he can be emailed at gartenberg AT gmail DOT com .
Views expressed here are his own .
First , the watch needed to be re-charged .
Consumers are used to measuring watch runtimes in years , not days , and although my informal tests showed I could travel for few days with the watch before I needed plug in , I suspect that put a lot of users off .
Second , in order to cover the data fees associated with the watch , there was a subscription fee of $ 59 a year to gain access to features above timekeeping .
This was not an outrageous sum , but Microsoft was never quite able to market SPOT to consumers in a way that explained the cost - benefit ratio .
Finally , watches are more than just telling time -- they 're status symbols and devices that serve to identify .
If that 's all users wanted to do , everyone would wear a $ 19.00 Timex that keeps better time than a $ 5,000 Rolex .
Even with partners like Swatch , Microsoft 's focus on utilitarian functions over the other reasons that people buy watches ultimately led to failure in the marketplace .
Overall , SPOT was an amazing concept that demonstrated software 's ability to transform already useful objects into devices that alter our everyday lives .
There was clearly a lot of thought put into SPOT 's functional design , but sadly Microsoft missed the forest for the trees .
It would be great for Microsoft to re-think its overall design goals and re-integrate SPOT 's design philosophy back into other products , like Windows Mobile .
( Microsoft had actually created beta prototype of SPOT functionality running under Windows Mobile , but I have n't heard much about it in a very long time ) .
The invisible space is a key attribute of mobile computing and it's a shame to let such valuable property go undeveloped .
It 's time for someone to recapture what was good about the SPOT philosophy and bring back the power of the glanceable and the invisible .
The main event : Get OKC schools out of Class 6A
Oklahoma City Public Schools football needs help from its district leaders .
Adult supervision has been lacking .
Someone has allowed certain OKC schools — notably Northwest Classen and U.S. Grant — to maintain enrollments greater than 1,200 students , which typically sends a school into Class 6A .
Oklahoma City Public Schools are not equipped to compete in 6A .
In anything .
Not athletics .
Not music .
Not any extra-curricular activity .
Especially football .
Inner-city schools struggle to compete against suburban schools in football .
That 's not just an OKC problem .
Putnam City , Putnam West , Midwest City and Del City are examples of former suburban schools whose socio-economic status evolved into inner-city schools , with a dip in football success .

Editorial : Positive thinking for a cooler world
“ I’M NOT convinced it ’s as bad as the experts make out …
It ’s everyone else ’s fault …
Even if I turn down my thermostat , it will make no difference . ”
The list of reasons for not acting to combat global warming goes on and on .
This month , an American Psychological Association ( APA ) task force released a report highlighting these and other psychological barriers standing in the way of action .
But do n’t despair .
The report also points to strategies that could be used …
WASHINGTON 
The brightly illuminated room looks like mission control for a space flight .
Seven people , wearing headphones , stare intently at computer screens .
Three minutes before the deadline , a disembodied voice exclaims , “ We have coverage . ”
This is no shuttle launch .
It is an auction of United States Treasury securities , and $ 32 billion has just been sold in a blink .
It was another successful operation for Van Zeck , the commissioner of the public debt , who has the world ’s biggest credit card .
Mr. Zeck has worked for the federal government for 38 of his 60 years .
He is a very busy man these days because the government is floating on a sea of red ink , as it borrows more and more money to stimulate the economy , bail out banks , shore up auto companies , aid struggling homeowners and fight foreign wars .
In a city full of pompous politicians and bombastic bureaucrats , Mr. Zeck quietly runs one of the government ’s truly indispensable operations .
He is not a policy maker .
He does not decide how much to borrow .
He just makes sure the money is borrowed , in a regular and predictable way , at the lowest possible cost to the government over time .
A new analysis finds that when colorectal cancer patients seek out health information from the internet and news media , they are more likely to be aware of and receive the latest treatments for their disease .
The study indicates that patients can influence their own treatment , in some cases in inappropriate ways .
In their review , authors led by Stacy Gray , M.D. of the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston note that in the last several decades , patients have become more involved in their health care as patient autonomy has become increasingly important .
That change has been accompanied by unprecedented growth in the amount of health information available to patients .
Studies show nearly four out of ten of cancer patients seek cancer information on the internet .
But the authors say it is unclear how these phenomena influence a cancer patient 's treatment .
Dr. Gray and colleagues from the NCI Center of Excellence in Cancer Communication Research at the University of Pennsylvania Annenberg School designed a study to examine the relationship between information - seeking among 633 colorectal cancer patients chosen at random from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry and the use of novel new agents for the disease .
The investigators focused on the use of the targeted therapies bevacizumab ( Avastin ) and cetuximab ( Erbitux ) because of these drugs ' clinical importance , significant media coverage , and recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
Dr. Gray and her team hypothesized that there would be a relationship between information seeking and awareness of these targeted therapies among colorectal cancer patients .
They also hypothesized that patients who seek information may ask their physicians about these targeted therapies and may be more likely to receive them than patients who do not seek information .
The researchers found that high levels of information seeking were strongly associated with both awareness of and receiving treatment using targeted therapies .
Patients who sought information about treatments for colorectal cancer were 2.83 times more likely to have heard about targeted therapies and 3.22 times more likely to have received targeted therapies than people who did not seek information .
These associations were present for patients with advanced disease where use of targeted therapies is FDA approved as well as for patients with early stages of the disease where their use is not FDA approved .
" These findings emphasize the importance of exploring patient influence on physician prescribing patterns and understanding the impact of information seeking on cancer outcomes , " the authors write .
