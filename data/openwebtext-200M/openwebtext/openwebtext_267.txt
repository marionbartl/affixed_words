Signing all the major studios is no small feat either .
Warner Bros. , Universal , 20th Century Fox , Sony Pictures , Paramount -- they 've all jumped on board iTunes .
Substantially all of Hollywood .
AppleTV , take two , has a real shot .
The power of technology .
The power of Apple and Steve Jobs .
I told Jobs that I had sat down with Microsoft 's Robbie Bach last week at the Consumer Electronics Show .
I mentioned that Bach was particularly optimistic about the new Zune , that it was now a worthy alternative to Apple 's iPod .
Asked Jobs : " Was he inebriated ?
Do you even know anyone who owns a Zune ? "
Touched a nerve , I suppose .
Watch the video we loaded .
It 's a great exchange .
I love the Time Capsule , the wireless external back - up storage device .
Great idea .
I 'd buy it .
Jobs told me he was thrilled with the iPhone sales numbers , even though Wall Street did n't seem to be .
Unfortunate , because that 4 million units seems pretty impressive after only 200 days on store shelves .
I asked him about the on - again , off - again negotiations with China Mobile .
" People just make this stuff up , " he tells me .
A single executive from China Mobile has visited Apple once .
No prolonged negotiations of any kind .
Fascinating .
Where does this stuff come from ?
But the best exchange with Jobs was toward the end of my interview when I asked him about recession worries and whether that would affect Apple sales .
He maintains iPods , Macs , the iPhone are all competitively priced and he 's not worried .
Period .
I asked him also to address Apple 's stock price that plunged during his speech today .
I learned long ago , he told me , to manage the topline and bottomline will follow .
He 's not fixated on stock price ; he 's fixated on designing neat products that captivate the Mac faithful and convert those who are n't yet part of the Mac faithful .
The rest , including a rising stock price , will follow .
Pretty simple .
Apple reports earnings a week from tonight .
Should be interesting to see what happens to Apple shares between now and then , as well as what this company will post from its all - important holiday shopping quarter .
Nothing I heard today turns me off to Apple , especially longer term .
Apple will be caught in the Wall Street downdraft , and recession worries are real , especially for a consumer electronics company .
But in these waves of uncertainty , fundamentally , Apple looks like a long - term island in a sea of short - term waves of uncertainty .

Allies of Hillary Clinton plan an expensive , stealth campaign to buttress her standing in the must - win states of Ohio , Texas and Pennsylvania .
They 're canvassing Clinton donors for pledges of up to $ 100,000 in the hope of raising at least $ 10 M by the end of next week .
The money will be placed in the account of a political committee organized under section 527 of the tax code .
A Democrat who was briefed on the project said that Pennsylvania attorney William A. K. Titelman is leading the effort to solicit money .
Titleman , who raised money for Gov. Bill Richardson 's presidential campaign , has not contributed money to Clinton .
He did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment .
By law , the 527 cannot coordinate its activities with the Clinton campaign , although at least one major Clinton donor with direct ties to the campaign said last night that the effort was an open secret among donors .
( Update : Per ABC 's Jake Tapper , the group is calling itself the " American Leadership Project " and is staffed by several veterans of the Clinton White House . )
A Clinton spokesman said he knew nothing about the 527 .
Two Democrats said that the 527 plans to run television ads and send pro-Clinton literature in all three states .
One of the Democrats said that the ads will also include contrast messages against Obama .
Plans for the 527 were conceived in late January , when Clinton 's campaign was nearly broke .
Since Feb. 5 , she has raised nearly $ 20 M , but still faces a resource disadvantage .
Obama 's aides said they 're approaching their goal of raising money from 500,000 new donors since Jan. 1 and project a total haul of more than $ 35 M for February .
Perhaps as early as today , a consortium of Service Employees union locals will disclose its own plans for mobilization in Ohio and Pennsylvania on behalf of Barack Obama , an irony that will not be lost on those covering the race closely : a similar SEIU compact in Iowa ran ads praising John Edwards and drew strong protests from Obama 's campaign .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Pop culture offerings in China these days run the gamut from Hollywood blockbusters to domestic versions of “ American Idol ” , but it is a book about the ancient sage Confucius that is causing all the buzz in the streets .
Yu Dan ( L ) , a professor from Beijing Normal University , signs an autograph for readers at a book store in Xi'an , northwest China 's Shaanxi province , in this January 24 , 2007 file photo .
Pop culture offerings in China these days run the gamut from Hollywood blockbusters to domestic versions of " American Idol " , but it is a book about the ancient sage Confucius that is causing all the buzz in the streets .
To match feature CHINA - CONFUCIUS / REUTERS / China Daily / Files
“ Notes on reading the Analects ” , by Beijing Normal University professor Yu Dan , has become China ’s best - selling book in recent memory , defying critics who say it turns Confucian thought into self - help pulp for the modern age .
“ It is good to have these teachings from old times because people are too selfish now , ” 60 - year - old accountant Qu Juan said of the book that has sold over 3 million copies in four months .
“ Everybody cares only about making money after the economic reforms , ” she said , flipping through the softback at a book shop .
Yu first shot to fame in October when she went on state TV to lecture on the Analects , a canon of Confucianism recording discussions between the ancient Chinese sage Confucius ( 551-479 BC ) and his disciples .
She wrote the book based on the TV transcripts .
Her mass following tells of deep anxiety about morality and beliefs in a society that has gone through a disorienting transformation in recent decades , analysts said .
“ We were taught Marxism and Leninism in schools , ” said Tian Na , a 25 - year - old teacher who bought the book on the Internet .
“ But when I became independent and went to college , I saw professors take bribes and I felt the old slogans like ‘ serve the people ’ were no longer relevant , ” she said .
Yu ’s book appeals across generations , despite the vastly different experiences of growing up as Tian did , in the relatively prosperous and stable reform era of the 1980s and 90s , or as the older generation did , during the tumultuous reign of Mao Zedong .
After the Communist Party took power in 1949 , a series of radical political movements plunged the country into anarchy and near economic bankruptcy , culminating in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution .
The turmoil is blamed by many for leading to mistrust between people and a breakdown of traditional values , including the Confucian ones which were denounced as “ reactionary ” , as the Party tried to obliterate the country ’s past .
INEXTRICABLE ANXIETY
Confucian philosophy , emphasizing high personal morality and a strict hierarchy of social relationships , was endorsed by China ’s imperial rulers over the past two millennia and still has huge influence in other East Asian nations .
Today , market - oriented reforms in China since the late 1970s have brought dazzling growth and greatly improved living conditions , but also a yawning wealth gap and social tensions .
The shattering of Communist ideals and the rush to get rich -- considered almost the sole indicator of success -- with whatever means have left many feeling lost or resentful .
“ A nation which used to value morality above everything else suddenly finds itself in a situation without a moral benchmark .
That causes inextricable anxiety , ” said Zhu Dake , a professor and cultural critic at Tongji University in Shanghai .
Yu delivers her message with a simplicity that has charmed readers but galls critics trained in the classics .
“ The essence of the Analects is to tell us how to live a happy life that our souls crave for , ” Yu wrote in the book .
“ Do n’t assume we should look up to it ... it is simply about orienting yourself in modern life . ”
LARGEST SOUL MARKET
Detractors argue that Yu offers little more than a mix of distorted ancient teachings and motivational stories tailored to tell readers how to handle stress and relationships .
They say
Yu takes advantage of the public ’s ignorance of classic literature and her success is a symptom of , rather than a prescription to the ailments of crazy commercialism and declining ethics characteristic of China nowadays .
“ Her moral preaching might be helpful in re-building more healthy social relationships now centered on money , but she has neither the courage nor the impulse to explore the ultimate meaning of life , ” said Zhu .
Yet such academic criticism has failed to dampen Yu ’s supporters .
They snapped up 15,000 autographed copies of her latest book in a single day .
The book offers similar content but borrows the thought of Zhuangzi , an ancient Taoist philosopher .
Writer Zha Jianying said Yu’s books had found a frantic audience in the ideological vacuum following the collapse of Communism as the “ state religion ” which has made China the world ’s “ largest soul market ” with its 1.3 billion population .
“ So be it Buddhism , Christianity or Yu Dan ’s version of Confucius , people embrace them , ” said Zha , author of an acclaimed 2006 book of interviews with a dozen Chinese cultural figures .
“ There are so many wounded , helpless souls that are desperate to find something to believe in and to hold on to after these drastic changes . ”
So you ’ve been blogging for a while but you ’re starting to hate it ?
You thought you could make easy money and order a brand new 24 ″ iMac to replace your old Windows box in less than a month or two ?
Do n’t wait for the south pole to melt , drop it , there are better things to do .
I came up with different statistical patterns observed through researches I ’ve made on the subject and you might be suffering from the Bloginozia virus .
It gets transmitted by either visiting Wal - Mart too frequently , or by falling into one or more of the following clinical observations :
1- Blogging For Money
Pro bloggers are constantly saying that if your goal is to blog for money , then you ’re almost guaranteed to fail .
Inspired by some bloggers ’ gigantic monthly revenues , too many new bloggers are jumping head first in the blogosphere hoping they can get their part of the pie .
Money is the consequence of success .
Success is the consequence of months of quality content .
If you think your blog will bring you important revenues in a short period of time , stop snoozing and wake up , this is not the case .
2- Blogging in the Make Money Online Niche
Inspired by clinical observation # 1 listed above , have you ever thought how many new bloggers are starting to blog about how to make money online every day ?
More than you can imagine !
What can they blog about ?
How credible can they be ?
What tips and money making techniques can they teach you if they are not even making a dime ?
Worst , they are losing money because they are paying $ 10 a month for hosting .
This does not make sense .
The Make Money Online niche is a jam pack football stadium and the only ones making money are the players on the field .
3- Niche Blogging
This one is the continuation of observation # 1 .
Ever heard of the multiple blogging recipes to make a fortune ?
Pick an empty niche , start posting regularly to optimize specific keywords and search engines will fall in love with your content .
As a result , you will magically rank in the first page of keyword - related search results , getting customers to purchase affiliate crap or click AdSense ads .
First , let ’s say that after a month of research you ’ve isolated a low crowded niche .
Great , now you need to produce content about cat litter .
Do you like emptying a cat litter ?
Do you see yourself producing 3 - 4 posts a week on cat litters ?
And before Google thinks you ’re THE cat litter reference , you will have emptied kitty ’s can too many times .
Blogging about a subject you are not passionate about is not fun .
It becomes work and it sucks .
4- The Pressure of Producing Quality Content Regularly
Content is king .
A blog that has low quality content does n’t stand out from the crowd .
Producing quality content is vital , and many bloggers are facing this challenge rapidly .
True , you can come up with a good post once in a while .
But if you wish to get dugg , to get thousands of stumblers visiting your site and reach Del.icio.us ’ , Sphinn ’s and BloggingZoom ’s front page , you need KILLER content .
Once you start blogging and you see fellow bloggers near you having more success than yourself on social media sites , you ’ll start introspecting your content .
Look at bloggers such as Skellie or Maki , pillar posts are pouring out of their brain .
It ’s like they sit , type , and here ’s another perfect article in no time .
This requires talent .
Inexperienced bloggers need hours to produce good content , and this often leads to discouragement .
5- You Feel Google AdSense is Like a Bad MasterCard Ad
Hosting fees : $ 10 a month
Domain Registration : $ 10 a year
WordPress For Dummies : $ 15
Customized Logo : $ 100
Customized WordPress
Theme : $ 500
Clicking your own Google AdSense banner to increment your total revenues to 1¢ on a payout of $ 100 : Priceless .
( Note : Doing this is strictly forbidden by Adsense ’s TOS , so do n’t do it ! )
6- Busted By Crappy Referral Programs
Here ’s a good example : A new concept such as DealDotCom is launched .
To create some buzz , DealDotCom contacts the 2 - 3 biggest pro bloggers in the Make Money Online niche to explain their referral program where you get a percentage of all referred members ’ sales .
When the big guys blog about it , DealDotCom gets hundreds if not thousands of new members in the following days .
Consequence ?
The program is close to saturation .
You can decide to add DealDotCom ’s banner on your site hoping bloggers will be subscribing under your referral link , but guess who did it first , dude ?
Who do you think will be making big dineros out of this program ?
7- RSS Subscribers too long to increase
Every single day you are looking at your stats hoping your RSS feed will finally display the magical number : 100 subscribers .
But nope , you have n’t passed the three figures yet .
If on a count of 25 subscribers you remove your 5 web email accounts and 10 of your friends , you are stuck with 10 pure RSS subscribers , and this sucks .
You could try opening 75 new accounts randomly on mac.com or gmail , but that would be a real pain .
And you would still be talking to yourself … so emailing yourself directly might be a better idea .
Increasing RSS subscribers takes time and energy , and unless you are ready to spend countless hours producing quality content , you better stop blogging once and for all .
8- Your WordPress Theme Sucks !
Dude , if you are still using WordPress ’ default theme , I honestly do n’t know what to say .
However , I totally understand why you hate your site .
This default theme is the worst thing ever designed in history .
Windows 3.0 was fine art compared to that !
Two options : either you find yourself a free theme that other bloggers already have , or you break your piggybank to get some dosh and pay for a customized theme .
See the Bad MasterCard ad above for a guesstimate .
9- Not Enough Traffic
Yep , 10 visitors a day is not THE best moral booster .
You may think Google Analytics does n’t know how to count visitors , but truth is , it ’s known as a pretty darn reliable source .
And by the way , do n’t forget to subtract visits from home , your job and your friends ’ computers where you ’ve set your blog as the default homepage .
10 - You Got Banned from Social Media Sites
So you ’ve spammed social media sites repeatedly only promoting your own content ?
Man , talk about failing with dignity .
You know how this is called ?
Bonsai Blogging , and I have tremendous respect for Bonsai misbehavers .
But if you did n’t know about the Bonsai and got banned , this means you neither read the sites ’
TOS nor this article titled Ever Stumbled Your Own Post ?
Nothing I can do to help , maybe you could try emailing kevin.rose [ AT ] digg [ DOT ] com .
This guest post was submitted by Patrick from Piggy Bank Pie .
Advocates of alternative - fuel vehicles would seem a unified bunch of tree huggers , bound by their determination to wean the world ’s automobiles off fossil fuels .
But there ’s a red - hot fight brewing in the green - car world .
Proponents of the two most hyped technologies -- hydrogen fuel cells and plug - in electric hybrids -- are squared off in an increasingly bitter fight .
They are vying for publicity , manufacturer acceptance , favorable regulation and , especially , funding for research and investment in infrastructure and marketing .
The battle has been simmering for several years , but with the technologies coming tantalizingly close to commercial reality , the stakes are higher than ever .
Whoever gets the upper hand now could determine what kind of cars we all drive in the future .
The camps are competing for potentially more than $ 2 billion in federal funding over the next five years and are lobbying for regulations that could have a profound effect on which type of car winds up on dealer lots .
Advertisement
“ It ’s just unfortunate that there has to be so much infighting , ” said Patricia Monahan of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists , which calls itself “ agnostic ” on which technology holds more promise .
“ Sometimes it seems almost personal . ”
Fundamentally , the disagreement is over which technology is more viable .
Fuel - cell vehicles use hydrogen to create electricity , which powers the car .
The only emission is water .
But critics ( some of whom call the technology “ fool cells ” ) contend that producing hydrogen requires three to four times more energy than the hydrogen later generates in the fuel cell .
They also say that the cars are too expensive and that hydrogen molecules can’t be easily contained without energy - consuming compressors or maintaining them in liquid form at extremely low temperatures .
Advertisement
Plug - in hybrids also are powered by electricity , but they draw their juice from batteries that are charged by plugging the car into the electrical grid .
In addition , they typically carry a small gasoline - or diesel - powered generator that can charge the batteries and extend the range of the vehicle .
Plug - in critics say battery technology is n’t advanced enough for long - range driving , and they doubt that the current electric infrastructure is robust enough to effectively charge a nation ’s entire fleet at once .
Plus , they note , much of the electricity that comes to our wall outlets is generated by burning fossil fuels .
The lack of common ground between the rival camps was on display this week in Anaheim at EVS - 23 , the nation ’s largest alternative - vehicle convention .
Standing in front of his booth , Lorne Gettel , president and chief executive of Advanced Lithium Power Inc. , dismissed fuel cells .
His Vancouver , Canada , company makes batteries for $ 80,000
Fisker plug - in luxury cars that are expected on the market by the end of next year .

“ The infrastructure is n’t there , the hydrogen is too expensive , and it ’s extremely difficult to store , ” he said .
“ The quickest way to reduce emissions is through plug - in hybrids . ”
Directly across the aisle , Paul Cass of fuel - cell maker Ballard Power Systems Inc. of Burnaby , Canada , saw things differently .
“ If you start plugging in hundreds of thousands of cars all at once , you ’ll be finding out what the limits of the electrical grid are real quick , ” he said .
“ Fuel cells are the only zero-emissions option . ”
Carmakers have largely straddled the fence , investing considerable resources in each technology .
General Motors Corp. , for example , says it will begin selling its Chevy Volt plug - in by 2010 , but it has begun lending 100 Chevy Equinox fuel - cell SUVs to selected drivers .
Ford Motor Co. handed over the keys to 20 plug-ins to Southern California Edison Co. last week , less than a month after buying , along with Daimler , Ballard ’s automotive fuel - cell business in a deal valued at $ 228 million .

Toyota Motor Corp. executives say the company ’s long - term bet is on hydrogen , even as it toys with converting its Prius hybrid into a plug-in .
In Washington , however , the story has been less equivocal .
Funding in the 1990s was limited but was , by most accounts , fairly balanced between technologies .
That changed in this decade , particularly after President Bush ’s 2003 State of the Union address , in which he called for a “ national commitment ” to fuel cells , pledging $ 1.2 billion for the first five years of a 10 - year development program .
Although batteries and plug - in technology do get some federal support , it ’s a fraction of that given to fuel cells .
For 2007 , the Energy Department budgeted $ 50.8 million to research and develop hybrid and electric propulsion , compared with $ 195.8 million for hydrogen technology .
Well - organized trade groups like the U.S. Fuel Cell Council and the National Hydrogen Assn. are lobbying hard to ramp up hydrogen - related funding in coming budgets , but plug - in advocates have a surprisingly muted voice in Congress .
Advertisement
“ In a word , I would say there is no trade or lobby group ” for plug - in hybrids and battery - only vehicles , said Marc Geller , co-founder of Plug In America , an activist group that does n’t get the kind of corporate support that hydrogen counterparts do .
The disparity plays out on the regulatory side as well .
Despite protests from the likes of Geller and a few activist scientists , California ’s complicated mandates requiring manufacturers to make zero-emission vehicles have for several years significantly favored fuel - cell vehicles over battery - powered ones .
Still , points out Bud deFlaviis , the U.S. Fuel Cell Council ’s director of government affairs , plug - in cars have one considerable advantage .
“ Batteries are a highly commercial product , but there are no truly viable hydrogen fuel cells on the market today , ” he said .
Thanks to growing sales of advanced lithium ion and other batteries in products including cordless drills and cellular phones , firms such as A123 Systems of Massachusetts ( which makes batteries for power tools as well as cars ) have income they can use for research .
“ That ’s a huge leg up , ” DeFlaviis said .

Even if one technology shows more immediate promise , it ’s important not to give up on the other , said Claudia Chandler of the California Energy Commission , which was recently given $ 120 million by the state Legislature to fund research on alternative fuels .
“ We ’re not picking winners right now , ” she said .

Suppose they gave a war , and nobody came ?
Why then , the war would come to you !
Bertol Brecht .
Just as individuals humans , organizations of humans vary considerably .
The local stamp collectors ' club has never warred on the neighboring folk music circle .
Many countries have not committed genocidal incursions into the adjoining lands in several generations .
However , as with individuals , enough organizations , including national governments , are threatening others at any moment in time to make it a matter of concern .
Traditionally , every country has had an army , a militia , a police force or a combination of those .
However well - equipped these entities are for carrying out their missions , please note that no organization has your personal safety as their reason for existence .
Hi-res Police exist to uphold the law .
Although cops try to protect people from criminal predation , it is an incidental part of their job .
Numerous court decisions have absolved police from liability for failure to protect individuals .
Even with the best intentions , police officers are too few to be everywhere they are needed at once .
Protection of persons is the job of bodyguards .
Unless you are rich enough to afford them , you may wish to learn how to be your own bodyguard .
Considering that most people have learned to be their own chauffeurs , chefs and accountants , learning yet another skill wo n't be much different .
Hi-res Hi-res
Another issue for consideration is that not all organizations live up to their intended missions .
When a group of people , be they a law enforcement agency or an entire state , go rogue , people under their control are in great danger .
No one , and certainly no group of people , can be trusted with a monopoly on force in the long run .
Hi-res
Hi-res Historic precedents of this kind are depressingly numerous .
We cannot open a history textbook and pick even a decade in which genocide and government oppression of civilians were absent .
Where most people are defenseless , even small numbers of ill - meaning agents of a government or an organized criminal group have murdered thousands with impunity .
Even the pretexts for the imposition of strict gun control remain constant .
The 1938 German weapons control law , which stripped Jews of all weapons , including sticks , was enacted as a response to " Jewish terrorist activities " .
The 1968 laws adopted in the United States were based closely on the 1938 German law and cited very similar reasons for the enactment .
Hi-res
Why would I mention gruesome historic details ?
If you look at the laws passed in the United States since 1934 , a trend emerges .
Ownership of many types of arms is either banned or severely restricted .
Onerous taxes and registration rules cover everything related to them .
Overall , it would see that the lessons history are ignored in the effort to disarm us .
Or , if you prefer to give the lawmakers and the sheep supporting them more credit , the lessons of history are being applied in a very cynical manner .
Hi-res
What is happening is far removed from a " government plot " to enslave Americans .
Rather individual agencies are trying to perpetuate their own existence and funding by either creating problems ( such as Prohibition and the current War on Drugs ) or by inventing them .
At the same time , law enforcement as an organization is attempting to gain monopoly on protection of individual .
Notice that the legislation to disarm American citizens is happening against the background of armed raids against " suspected drug dealers . "
Continuing the practices perfected by the Inquisition , the so - called law - enforcement agencies are killing their victims outright or seizing their assets before trial .
Obviously , such tactics work better where the law - abiding are disarmed .
Just ask the SS chaps .
Hi-res Hi-res Historic evidence shows clearly what happens when government agencies are permitted to abuse defenseless individuals .
We also know that mere ability to resist usually functions as an effective deterrence to gross abuses of human rights .
Hi-res Hi-res
Of the many organizations keen on implementing gun control , the UN has been the most active .
Like every other goverment or gang , the UN are after maintaining control and not ensuring safety of those they pretend to protect .
They have achieved some successes in disarming civilians , setting them up for genocide .
For example , in 1995 the UN disarmed Bosnians of Srebrenica , promising them protection .
The UN troops then withdrew , Srebrenica was overrun and over 8,000 now - disarmed people were murdered by the Serb army .
Other efforts originate in the United States .
While the IRS branch of the Treasury Department is buying arms for its enforcers , the ATF branch of the same organization is harrassing lawful gun owners and manufacturers .
Ostensibly a tax collection agency , the ATF has evolved into a terrorist organization dedicated to furthering gun control in America .
They have dropped even the pretence of being tax collectors and have concentrated on the enforcement of convoluted , sometimes contradictory and , in all cases , un-Constitutional laws regulating even the most minute aspects of gun ownership .
Hi-res
Some people laugh and ask if I really think that a few small arms could have changed history .
If the six million Jews who perished during WW2 had a rifle for every one of the half - million combatants they could field , would they still have ended up slaughtered so efficiently ?
If they had mortars and light machine guns typical of the contemporary infantry , would they have been murdered at all ?
Ownership of weapons makes genocides more difficult to commit ... but it takes effective weapons to stop genocide entirely .
Will You be Miley Cyrus ' Friend
Flashback :
It 's 1987 and I have been bribed into running for a local pageant .
It gets down to the top 10 finalist and damn I have been chosen .
The announcer gets to me , it is my turn to answer the million dollar question , " If you were to win Miss Pepper Fest , what would you hope to get out of the experience ? "
I stand there thinking what the heck have I gotten myself into and I have nothing .
She asks me the question again and I mutter the word " friends " and nothing else .
The manly lady says , " Is there anything else you would like to get out of this ? "
And I say " nope , just friends " .
Miley Cyrus is on a quest to find more friends due to the fact that her parents are so strict .
She said , " some people think you have more privileges than other teenagers because of what you do , and that not it at all .
It 's actually the opposite . "
Miley said both parents are strict but her mom is stricter when it comes to who she is hanging with ( we 're guessing it is because of all those pictures that you take with your friends ) .
Well Miley , why do n't you try entering a pageant .
You could definitely find some more friends or just embarrass yourself for life and be known as the girl who just wants friends .
As for your friends , your mother needs to make sure to always send you out in your Sunday best and to make sure there are no cameras .
Oh and one other thing , you should not share your candy with others under any circumstances - if you get my drift .
Good luck on your quest for friends !
Hey , I have added a couple of Miley 's questionable photos after the jump that I am sure are what make Mama Cyrus a wee bit worried .
皆さんはきっと家庭内無線LANを設置していたり、コーヒーショップや空港のホットスポットに接続したりしているだろう。だが、Wi-Fiを最大限に活用しているだろうか？
無線信号の強化、拡張、ブリッジ、保護、傍受、検知、不可視化など、今回は無線LANのパワーユーザーのために、Wi-Fiユーティリティと調整術のベスト10を紹介する。
10 . 設置場所を工夫して、電波の範囲を広げる
Wi-Fi信号を強化するソフト、ハードのハッキングは幾つかあるが（下の項目を参照）、幾つかシンプルな調整を加えれば、アクセスポイントを改造せずに最大限に範囲を広げられる。New York Timesによると、
ベースステーションを上階の中央または家具の上に置く。無線波は横方向と下方向に最も広がるからだ
信号を急な角度で受信せず、かつ厚い壁、鏡、水槽、金属を通して受信しなければ、受信状態は良くなる
コードレス電話や電子レンジ、赤ん坊の監視装置、ハロゲンランプなど干渉を起こす可能性のある家庭内の機器から離れたところに無線LANコンポーネントを置く
近隣のネットワーク機器との干渉を避けるため、デフォルトの信号チャンネル（たいていは6にセットされている）を変更する
9. リピータで信号を拡張する、またはブリッジにつなぐ
それでも地下まで十分に電波が届かない場合、窓枠に上って近隣の信号をキャッチしなければならないだろうか？
無線信号リピータを用意して（あるいはルータをリピータにして）電波の範囲をさらに拡大する。
アクセスポイントから遠く離れたところに有線デバイスがあって、ちょっと接続する必要がある場合は、ワイヤレスブリッジ（時にイーサネットコンバータとも呼ばれる）を使えば、無線信号を変換して（居間のメディアセンターのような）有線デバイスをつなげる。
8. Wiresharkでパケットデータを傍受する
無線LANに接続しているときに、空中を飛び交っているデータをのぞきたいと思ったら？ 以前に取り上げたWireshark（旧称「 Ethereal」）は、以下のように、自分の無線LANの現状を見てみたいと思っている人にとって便利なパケットスニッファだ。
7. WPA 暗号化を有効にする
Wi-Fiのセキュリティはあまり安全ではないが、自分のアクセスポイントがほかよりも安全なら、悪意を持ったクラッカーがよそへ移る可能性は高くなる。「出回っている中でベスト」なセキュリティを考えると、ほとんどの無線LANアクセスポイントはWEP暗号化を使って接続をパスワード保護するよう設定されているが、WPA（最近のほとんどのコンピュータやルータでサポートされている）はWEPよりもクラックが容易でない。WPAに切り替えるには、アクセスポイントの管理ページで、セキュリティレベルを変更して、長くてクラックされにくいWPAパスフレーズを設定する。
6. MAC アドレスを制限する
同じように、MACアドレスのデバイスアクセスリストを作れば、自分の無線LANに接続できるデバイスも正確に制限できる（MACアドレスは、ノートPC、携帯電話、リピータなどネットワークに接続するデバイスの一意な識別子）。アクセスポイントの構成画面で、どのMACアドレス（例えば、家庭内のすべてのコンピュータなど）が自分の無線LANを使えるかを設定できる。
デバイス名 MACアドレス Airstation 00:19:e3:d4:30:29 Powerbook 00:18:e3:d4:30:21 MacBook 00:19:e1:d4:30:15 desktop 00:13:e3:d1:35:29
5. 自分のネットワーク名をブロードキャストしない
周りに自分のネットワークを知らせたくない場合は、SSIDブロードキャストをオフにすることだ。そうすれば、一般的な古いノートPCなどのデバイスでは、自分のネットワークが検出されてリストアップされることはなくなる。そのためにはアクセスポイントの管理ページで「 Enable SSID Broadcast」のチェックマークを外す。
上述したほかのセキュリティ対策と同様に、SSIDブロードキャストをオフにしたというだけでは、アクセスポイントを探知できる適切なソフトを持ったユーザーは防げない──防げるのはデフォルトのワイヤレス検出機能を使っているユーザーだけだ。適切なソフトと言えば……。
4. NetStumblerでネットワークを検出する

( CNN ) --
It was one of Hillary Clinton 's last chances to knock rival Barack Obama -- seemingly on a path to the Democratic nomination -- off course .
Sen. Barack Obama has won 11 straight contests against Sen. Hillary Clinton .

But throughout the CNN / Univision debate in Austin , Texas , on Thursday night , the New York senator struck a cautious and , at times , conciliatory tone toward Obama , and likely did little to blunt the momentum of a candidate who has won 11 straight contests .
It was n't quite the love - fest of the CNN debate in Los Angeles , California , three weeks ago , but Clinton repeatedly shied away from challenging her rival , even when the debate 's moderators gave her ample opportunities to do so .
Obama emerged relatively unscathed as a result .
It was , by all measures , a victory for the Illinois senator given the clear front - runner status he now holds .

But it was by no means a poor performance for Clinton , and she did successfully draw some contrasts with Obama on his health care stance -- an issue in which she holds the upper hand .
Obama 's plan could leave many uninsured , and Clinton effectively stressed this point in one of her strongest moments of the debate .
She immediately put Obama on the defensive about his own plan and proved she understands this issue through and through .

Plus , Clinton clearly ended on a strong note , eloquently responding to the question about a time she had been tested with a reference to her past that drew laughter , and a poignant answer about how her problems pale in comparison to those of average voters .
It was her " Casablanca " moment , reminiscent of the legendary movie 's final moment when the protagonist declared , " It does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world . "

Clinton also ended her answer with her most conciliatory tone toward Obama to date , in a response that seemed to signal for the first time that she felt she might not win her party 's nomination .
" You know , no matter what happens in this contest , I am honored .
I am honored to be here with Barack Obama , " Clinton said .
" I am absolutely honored . "
The answer received a standing ovation , and it was certainly a memorable moment -- but it 's unclear if it did anything more than harden the support she already has .
Most likely , it wo n't change the dynamic of this race , though the true effect of it will be determined by the media coverage around it :
Should it get replayed over and over on television , it just may have an impact on this race and could stand out as the debate 's most striking moment .
Obama had several strong moments as well , especially when he raised the issue of Iraq and his early opposition to it .
It 's a contrast he repeatedly draws with Clinton , who voted for the Iraq war resolution .
When Clinton suggested he lacked the experience to be president , Obama effectively cited his early opposition as evidence his judgment is better than hers .
On the whole , Iraq is an issue Obama always does well discussing , drawing upon his strong rhetorical skills to convey the human toll the war has cost and his reasons for opposing it early on .
Watch candidates debate the " surge " in Iraq »
But Obama 's strongest moments came when he was successful in framing the debate more about style than policy .
Clinton has always been a policy wonk , and has proven on more than one occasion that she is more comfortable than Obama discussing the nuances on a host of issues .
And on substance , Clinton had the upper hand Thursday night .
Obama aptly steered the debate away from policy differences and more toward his leadership style -- an approach that has repeatedly proven beneficial to him throughout the campaign .
He stressed several times his ability to work across the aisle and to reach consensus with Republicans .
It 's an argument that usually plays much better in a general election than during primary season .
Plus , it offers a sharp contrast with the leadership approach Clinton emphasizes -- a readiness to fight Republicans every step of the way , if necessary .
But this campaign season seems to have proven even the most partisan Democrats are ready for a different kind of politics , an environment that favors Obama 's argument over Clinton's .
( At no point was Obama 's effort to paint himself as a consensus builder on clearer display than when he raised his past collaboration with Oklahoma Sen .
Tom Coburn , one of the most conservative Republican senators and not the most popular figure in Democratic circles ) .
Both candidates ' strong moments aside , Thursday 's debate will likely most be remembered for what did not happen .
With her back against the ropes -- and most likely only one primary loss away from the end of her presidential bid -- Clinton simply chose to throw too few punches to clearly counter Obama 's increasing strength .

All About Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton
Dave Hitz , co-founder of NetApp , has an amusing blog post up that looks at " lawyer speak " from an efficency point of view .
In Think of a Will as a Program You Can Only Test By Dying he considers the number of characters required to get a simple goal accomplished in both C and Legal Language ( a will in this case ) :
The smallest " useful " computer program simply prints " Hello World ! " .
It does almost nothing , so most of the program is overhead .
In C , it takes 53 characters of program to print 12 bytes of text � an overhead factor of 4.4 .
I�ve been reading LEGAL this week , because some friends of mine are writing their will .
I agreed to be the trustee in case both parents die while the kids are still young .
It occurred to me that the " hello world " of wills is this :
Leave everything to my spouse .
If s/he is dead , then split it evenly among my kids .
This is pretty much what my friends ' will said , but to express these 83 bytes of idea took 18,700 bytes of LEGAL , for an overhead factor of 225 .
That is , LEGAL is 51 times less efficient than C .
Heh .
He goes on to answer the question " Why is LEGAL such a shitty language ? " and finds that , among other problems , " it doesn�t use modern techniques like subroutines or standard libraries . "
Doing so would save a ton of time and effort .
It 'd probably also reduce the lawyer 's income .
As he concludes :
Of course , there is one additional reason that legal documents are so long :
Many lawyers are paid by the hour .
Indeed .
I 'm not quite sure why this amused me as much as it did .
Perhaps it 's my programming background combined with the fact that I 've been reading more legal documents recently .
Either way , I can definitely see his points .
The legal profession could learn a thing or two from good programming practices .
If you 've ever heard stories about companies that experiment with paying their programmers based on the number of lines of code written ( or number of bugs fixed per week ) , you 'd understand how crazy this really could be .

Sears and Kmart are places you might go when you need a new air conditioner filter or a lawnmower ; they 're not generally thought of as havens for spyware .
But that 's what the two stores have become , at least online , where their web sites were found to be installing software to track users ' every online move — all without their knowledge .
Security researchers are now hammering Sears ( the owner of both Sears.com and Kmart.com ) for the move , despite Sears ' claims that users were notified adequately beforehand .
The story goes like this : late last year , Sears.com and Kmart.com began asking users if they wanted to participate in a " community " online ( presumably a community made up of Sears and Kmart aficionados ) .
In late December , security researcher Benjamin Googins at Computer Associates noticed , however , that the " community " actually installed software from comScore , a market research firm , in order to track the web activities of the sites ' visitors .
Googins stated on his company 's blog that Sears had installed spyware which transmitted everything — " including banking logins , email , and all other forms of Internet usage " — to comScore for analysis .
This was all allegedly done with no notice that anything was being installed , and it ran contrary to documentation about the community that said any data collected would stay within Sears ' hands at all times .
But wait , there 's more !
In an update to his original post , Googins noted that Sears actually offers a slightly different privacy policy — via the same URL — to compromised computers versus those that have yet to install the software .
" If you access that URL with a machine compromised by the Sears proxy software , you will get the policy with direct language ( like ' monitors all Internet behavior ' ) .
If you access the policy using an uncompromised system , you will get the toned - down version ( like ' provide superior service ' ) , " he wrote .
Surprisingly , Sears VP Rob Harles responded to Googins ' original post , stating that the company " goes to great lengths to describe the tracking aspect . "
He claims that " clear notice " is provided to users multiple times throughout the sign - up process .
The " community " continued on .
Now , spyware researcher Ben Edelman has taken a look at the situation , and he agrees with Googins ' assessment .
Edelman heavily scrutinized all documentation that came with signing up for the community and found a few mentions of tracking software buried deep within the tangled legalese ( for example , one mention was on page 10 of a 54 - page license document ) .
This , he says , goes against regulations by the Federal Trade Commission that require clear , unavoidable disclosure and " express consent " from the user before installing such software .
The two vague disclosures that Edelman found both fail to meet the FTC 's standards , he says , and he argues that Harles could n't possibly be more incorrect in his assertions that Sears goes to great lengths — or any lengths at all — to inform users of what 's going on .
The whole incident is reminiscent of another recent privacy blunder by Facebook , where its Beacon application tracked user activity elsewhere on the web and reported it back to the site for the world to see .
The difference is that Facebook reacted relatively quickly to the community outrage ( that is , the real , actual Facebook community , and not a nebulous term to describe being tracked by a retailer ) and made significant changes to how Beacon interacted with the users it was tracking .
The situation is still not perfect — the tool still tracks users ' activity even if they choose not to have it displayed — but it puts Facebook light - years ahead of where Sears is right now .
As of today , Sears ' online community — complete with very detailed comScore tracking software — is still available online .
That does n't help me at all .
Well , it 's important to think about these things in context .
Also , it 's important that you take a moment to ask yourself a really essential question .
What 's that ?
Did you do it ?
What ?
No !
Look , if you REALLY did n't share anything , you can skip on a couple paragraphs .
But it 's really important to be honest with at least one person here , even if that person is just yourself .
If you really did share files , you 're really not going to gain anything by fighting some noble battle .
Especially if money is important to you .
Did we mention how much money the RIAA 's legal team has ?
If the RIAA 's logs show the IP address associated with your internet connection as having downloaded certain files , chances are you 're going to end up paying one way or another .
Whatever , sellout .
Look , at this point it 's not really a moral issue , it 's a financial one -- if you did what they say you did , you 're vastly better off paying the money and moving on .
It 's not a criminal charge , and the terms of the settlement will be most likely be confidential , so it wo n't come up again in your life .
Paying a lawyer to fight and lose for you will likely just cost you more money , because the RIAA will get at least $ 750 for each track you 've shared , and for the average P2P user that adds up fast .
There have been cases where users with open Wi -Fi networks have had their cases dismissed , but those are fairly rare -- maybe half a dozen of the tens of thousands cases filed .
Although it 's a sad truth , the reality is that once you get caught -- really caught -- infringing copyrighted materials , very few people have sympathy for you , least of all the courts .
So , take a moment , convince yourself that sharing the entire a- ha back catalog was worth it , and call a lawyer who 's handled RIAA cases before to take care of your settlement , which is usually somewhere between three and five thousand dollars .
It 's by far the cheapest option .
Well , that 's great , but I did n't do anything wrong .
In that case , the first thing you should do is check and see what kind of letter you 've gotten from the RIAA .
Who is it from ?
If you 're a college student , there 's a good possibility it 's from your school , saying you might be sued .
In that case you should STAY AWAY FROM THE RIAA .
Do n't visit the settlement website , do n't call the hotline .
The RIAA does n't know exactly who you are yet , so do n't up and go telling them .
Of course they know who I am !
I got this letter , did n't I ?
The only thing the RIAA knows is that your IP address was sharing files -- that letter was from your school .
Every school deals with this differently , but you need to be in touch with the legal department at your school in order to begin clearing this up -- not necessarily the RIAA .
Again , do n't give the RIAA any more than you need to .
Good for the college kids , but I 'm sitting here holding a notice of an actual lawsuit , and I did n't share any files either .
In that case , you need to act right away .
Make sure you 've got documentation showing what kind of internet service you have , how long you 've had it , and what kind of computers you have hooked up to your router .
It would also be good to catalog all the music on your machines .
Generally this information is all you 'll need to give a lawyer to get started on your case -- and although the RIAA is stubborn , they will drop cases once it 's obvious that they 'll lose , because they are terrified of losing in court .
Do n't wait one extra second to do this , however -- the longer you hold off , the less likely the RIAA is to dismiss your case , and the less likely it is that you 'll get your attorney 's fees back if you end up going to court .
Man , this is really depressing .
It is , but the more information you have about this , the better .
We 're not big fans of the RIAA 's scare tactics -- and we 're pretty certain those tactics are n't having any effect on filesharing -- but we 're not trying to sugarcoat reality , either .
Stay safe , stay respectful , and most of all -- know your rights .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Singapore Airlines , the first operator of the new Airbus A380 , has dashed the hopes of sexual thrill - seekers planning to engage in amorous activity aboard the world ’s biggest jumbo jet .
The carrier said it would ask passengers on the A380 to refrain from sex while ensconced in one of its 12 first - class suites , which boast the world ’s first airborne double beds .
“ All we ask of customers , wherever they are on our aircraft , is to observe standards that do n’t cause offence to other customers and crew , ” the company told Reuters in a statement .
“ Nothing different applies for our Singapore Airlines Suites customers . ”
While private , the double cabins are neither sound proofed nor completely sealed .
Singapore Airlines , the world ’s second - largest airline by market value , started commercial flights of the double - decker A380 last week with a Singapore - Sydney service .
“ So they ’ll sell you a double bed , and give you privacy and endless champagne and then say you ca n’t do what comes naturally ? ”
Tony Elwood , who traveled with wife Julie in a suite aboard the inaugural flight , told the Times of London .
“ They seem to have done everything they can to make it romantic , short of bringing round oysters , ” Julie said .
“ I ’d say they should n’t really complain , should they ? ”
Yet another GOP candidate rejects modern biology
Way back in May , in one of the more memorable debate moments of the year , John McCain was asked a straightforward question : “ Do you believe in evolution ? ”
It ’s the 21st century and McCain is an educated man , so it should have been an easy one , but he ’s a Republican , and he needs to appeal to a far - right base that has little use for modern science — so he hesitated .
After a pregnant pause , McCain said , “ Yes . ”
The Politico ’s Jim VandeHei opened it up to the stage : “ I ’m curious , is there anybody on the stage that does not agree , believe in evolution ? ”
The camera did n’t show the 10 candidates for very long , but three would - be presidents raised their hand : Sam Brownback , Mike Huckabee , and Tom Tancredo .
At the time , I was torn .
Was it good news that seven in 10 Republican presidential candidates accept scientific reality , or was it bad news that three in 10 presidential hopefuls reject the foundation of modern biology ?
As it turns out , though , there was one more evolution - denier on the stage who , for whatever reason , did n’t raise his hand at the time .
Ron Chusid directed me to this Ron Paul video , posted to YouTube last week .
Here ’s the key exchange :
Audience member : I saw you in one of the earlier debates , all of the candidates were asked if they believe the theory of evolution to be true and they had a show of hands , but I did n’t see which way you voted , and I was wondering if you believe it to be true , and should it be taught in our schools .
Paul : First , I thought it was a very inappropriate question , you know , for the presidency to be decided on a scientific matter .
And I , um , I think it ’s a theory , theory of evolution , and I do n’t accept it , you know , as a theory … .
I just do n’t think we ’re at a point where anybody has absolute proof , on either side .
Yes , in 2007 , 10 Republicans were running for president , and four of them reject modern biology .
To be sure , this may seem , at first blush , like a tangential issue .
These guys are running for president , not a local school board , so their thoughts on biology are n’t likely to have any real impact on curricula any where in the country .
But I still think it ’s relevant .
For a presidential candidate , in 2007 , to concede disbelief in evolution does n’t reflect well on their understanding of facts and evidence .
If they reject the overwhelming proof on modern biology , how will they deal with evidence regarding global warming ?
Or stem - cell research ?
Or a public health emergency ?
Or any public policy that deals with science ?
Lawrence Krauss , a professor of physics and astronomy at Case Western Reserve University and chair of the Physics Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , recently had a good op - ed in the Wall Street Journal about science and the presidential candidates in general .
The day before the most recent Democratic presidential debate , the media reported a new study demonstrating that U.S. middle - school students , even in poorly performing states , do better on math and science tests than many of their peers in Europe .
The bad news is that students in Asian countries , who are likely to be our chief economic competitors in the 21st century , significantly outperform all U.S. students , even those in the highest - achieving states .
While these figures were not raised in recent Democratic or Republican debates , they reflect a major challenge for the next president : the need to guide both the public and Congress to address the problems that have produced this “ science gap , ” as well as the serious consequences that may result from it .
America ’s current economic strength derives from the investments in fundamental research and technology made a generation ago .
Future strength will depend upon research being done today .
One might argue that many key discoveries occurred as a result of importing scientific talent .
But as foreign educational systems and economies flourish , our ability to attract and keep new talent could easily erode .
Even with a continued foreign influx of scientific talent , it would be foolish to expect that we can maintain our technological leadership without a solid domestic workforce as well .
Almost all of the major challenges we will face as a nation in this new century , from the environment , national security and economic competitiveness to energy strategies , have a scientific or technological basis .
Can a president who is not comfortable thinking about science hope to lead instead of follow ? [… ]
Even if the American public is not currently focused on these concerns , decisions made by the next U.S. president on issues such as climate change , energy research , stem cells and nuclear proliferation will have a global impact .
We owe it to the next generation to take ownership of these issues now .
In spite of the ambivalence reflected in some polls , there is a popular understanding that science and technology will be essential to meet the challenges we face as a society .
When reports began to surface warning that the avian flu might become a threat to humans , for example , everyone from the president down called for studies to determine how quickly the virus might mutate from birds to human beings .
No one suggested that “ intelligent design , ” for example , could provide answers .
Precisely .
Science matters — indeed , reality matters — to the nation ’s ability to compete in the future .
At this point , only two of the remaining seven Republican presidential candidates ( Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul ) refuse to accept the cornerstone of modern biology , but that ’s two too many .
The conviction of a teenage girl who used a mobile phone to film a man being kicked and punched to death in a so - called " happy slapping " attack is thought to be the first of its kind in England and Wales , prosecutors said today .
The 15 - year - old , who can not be named for legal reasons , admitted at a hearing yesterday recording part of the violent attack that killed Gavin Waterhouse , 29 .
Leeds crown court heard how Waterhouse was attacked by Mark Masters , 19 , and a 17 - year - old youth , who also cannot be named , in Keighley , West Yorkshire , in September last year .
The victim managed to return to his flat after the assault but died from internal injuries .
Both men admitted manslaughter at a previous hearing .
The girl yesterday pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting manslaughter .
According to the crown prosecution service ( CPS ) , the girl was handed a mobile phone by one of the attackers and told to " video this " .
She then approached Waterhouse and asked him for money before recording the attack upon him that followed .
Prosecution witnesses said they saw and heard the attackers boasting about what they had just done , saying it was not the first time they had attacked the victim .
They also shared the video footage of the incident with friends after the attack .
Judith Naylor , of CPS West Yorkshire , said : " As far as I am aware , this is the first time a suspect in England and Wales has been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter , for the filming of an , inaptly called , ' happy slapping ' incident .
" We have seen and heard of many instances in recent months and years , where youths have been encouraged by their peers to attack innocent people , without words ever having been used .
" The message is this : if you stand by and watch your friends committing brutal crimes and video - record their acts for your , or for others ' , amusement your actions will not be ignored by the law enforcement agencies and prosecution may follow . "
Yesterday , Judge James Stewart heard how the defendant claimed she did not know Masters before he passed her the phone and asked her to use it .
She even had to ask him how to use the camera before filming about 15 minutes of the violence .
The girl will be sentenced at a date to be fixed along with Masters , of Parkwood Rise , Keighley , and the other youth .
Come the first few months of 2008 , if you 're an old - fashioned American progressive in need of entertainment , you wo n't be able to beat listening all over the country for heads exploding across the aisle any time Rudy Giuliani wins a Republican primary .
Not to distract from the Democrats , but for a change , nearly all the people on our side seem relatively sane , informed , and intelligent .
Meanwhile , on the GOP side , they have choices ranging from a raging martinet and Gumby the Rubber - Principled Man to Frederick of Hollywood and a victim of actual torture who gets booed out of his own party 's debates when he suggests it might not be such a good tactic in the supposed global war on terror .
And the man who leads the pack is Giuliani , whose entire platform for the presidency consists of " OHMYGODTHEYWANTTOKILLUS ! "
If the only thing we have to fear is fear itself , then the former Mayor Giuliani will be running his command center from underneath his bed .
If you 've had a chance to look back at the good old , bad old days of Giuliani 's years as mayor of New York , you might have been swayed by the fact that , yes , New York became a much safer , much more livable place .
On the other hand , if your name was Amadou Diallo or Abner Louima , perhaps not so much .
Especially with the toilet plunger sodomy part .
( Do n't ask me to explain - that 's what Wikipedia is for . )
If you like George W. Bush - and it's hard to find anyone outside of the Malkinite loons and Weekly Standard editor Fred Barnes who does - you 'll go moist over Giuliani .
Arrogant ?
Check .
Dismissive of opinions other than his own ?
Check .
A firm believer in the use of unilateral power ?
Check , check , and check .
Read this excerpt from Rachel Morris ' Washington Monthly article about the start of the Giuliani regime in New York :
Bush has spent his entire presidency surrounded by people selected solely on the basis of the fact that they agree with him .
Giuliani 's sycophants already come with a nickname : the " Yesrudys , " who exist to tell him that everything he 's doing is right .
And with Giuliani , who will tell him that torture is wrong , that Iran is not the global nuclear threat that his crazed advisers tell him it is , that putting a " missile defense shield " in Europe right next to an increasingly antsy Russia is n't the best method of diplomacy ?
But the reason you 'll hear heads exploding all over the country should Giuliani start winning primaries is on the domestic front .
This will revolve around the question :
Do politicians really change their spots ?
The gun lobby , after eight years of working right out of Bush 's office , will have to get their heads around the idea that all the " gun-grabbing liberals " that they 've been warning us about for the last 20 years pale in comparison to the intrusive , big government Peeping Tom that government would become under Giuliani .
As for the fundamentalist Christian right , they 're already making noises about breaking off and supporting a third - party candidate if Giuliani is the nominee .
The thrice - married man who appeared in drag and moved in with a gay couple when he separated from his wife will make Fred Phelps and his Ã¼ber - wackjobs at Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas declare that the end is here , and their god hates fags signs will line Pennsylvania Avenue for a Giuliani inauguration .
And think of how the supposed pro-choice Giuliani , now making sounds about how he'd nominate more Scalias and Alitos to the Supreme Court , makes the Operation Rescue crowd wonder if they should be flipping a coin on whether or not to trust him .
Abortion is n't an issue you can explain away by saying " 9/11 " over and over again .
Giuliani might be the best entertainment we 've seen in years .
Me , I can hardly wait - pass the popcorn !

I believe it is important for anyone who is considering using Wal - Mart ’s new Site to Store service to read the letter I sent Wal - Mart Corporate early this morning regarding my family ’s significant problems with their service over the past week .
Please read below .
“ Wal - Mart Corporation :
My name is Tyler Thompson , a resident of Derby Kansas and a frequent customer of your stores .
As a profession , I am a web developer in Wichita and also the Editor - in - Chief of a popular technology website PCMech.com .
I am writing in utter disbelief of the events relating to your store , its customer service , and your new Site to Store service .
Over the past week , my family ’s patience has been pushed beyond the limit by the sheer lack of competence shown by the Wal - Mart employees at your Derby location .
Please let me begin by describing the situation over the last week .
My mother and I had been looking for a game , Guitar Hero III for PlayStation 2 with a Guitar , for several days when I came across an available version at your online store .
Immediately , I sent the link to my mother who proceeded to place an order on Tuesday December 4 , 2007 with shipping options set for your new Site to Store service .
The problems began here , as the credit card used for the transaction was declined three times by your online processing service and then was locked out by the same service for exceeding your overflow limit .
My mother tried again with a different credit card , which worked perfectly the first time .
It was not until later she realized that although your online processor had declined her first credit card , it had charged this card all three times for the amount of the order .
After calling customer service , this issue was resolved quickly .
Unfortunately , the problems did not end there , and they were relatively minor in comparison to what was to come .
On Saturday December 8 , 2007 , my mother received an email notification ( the first sent by your service since the order ) with the subject “ Pickup Confirmation ” – we believed this to be the notification promised as per your invoice ’s instructions on how your Site to Store service worked , step one : “ Wait for an email telling you your order is ready for pickup ( 7 - 10 days ) ” – however , the email did not mention anything about the order being ready for pickup .
In fact , it was worded as if the order had already been picked up .
Confused by the situation , I called the store to clarify whether this was the email notifying us the order was ready for pickup .
When I called , I immediately asked for a customer service representative , who I was readily transferred to .
I inquired about the email we received and was then put on hold for “ someone who knew something about how it worked . ”
After a few minutes , another person picks up the phone , and after again describing the situation to her , I was again told “ I do n’t know how that works , let me find someone who can help you . ”
Finally , on the third try , I was handed off to someone from the back of the store who “ knew what they were doing ” .
This person was very responsive and positive to deal with , as she promptly looked up our order , first by last name .
She sounded frustrated when no results came back for an available pickup .
She then asked for a street address to check for .
Again , within seconds , she came back with a negative response about a pickup being ready .
The representative then asked for an order number to search .
I found the order number and read it to her over the phone , to a quick response of “ Oh no .
It shows the order has already been picked up .
Are you sure you have not had anyone pick it up for you ? ”
My response was that no one had picked up the order and the situation was not good .
The representative looked up the order status further to find that there was a signature on file for the package .
As soon as this was discovered , I was transferred to a manager , where I let my mother take over the phone conversation because she had been the one to place the order .
After a few minutes on the phone , my mother was asked to come into the store to discuss the matter further .
She left at around 10 PM and went to management in your Derby location .
Obviously the signature was not a valid one for the package , and the situation began to escalate .
After an employee from the stocking area confronted my mother and told her , several times , that “ She was not perfect , ” my mother asked for her to get out of her face , to deal strictly with management , and to be issued a refund .
Three different managers refused to process the refund request , and at one point an employee told my mother “ It would be extremely easy for anyone to just print off an order confirmation page and bring it in to the store for items such as that . ”
This has two meanings , first of which alleging that my mother was defrauding the company , or that Wal - Mart ’s security is not tight enough regarding its online order process .
After being refused the refund by the management , she requested to speak with corporate headquarters , which was originally denied , but upon further attempts was allowed in the store .
The lady who my mother dealt with at corporate was very accommodating and immediately told the manager in the store to process the refund and to apologize for the employee ’s rudeness .
The refund was eventually processed and corporate issued a new order to be shipped to our house for free .
First of all , the most important implication of this event is security .
On the order confirmation page , step three , it says “ Go to the Site to Store area at your store and present your printed email and a valid photo ID . ”
And under that , in at least two different areas , it lists the “ Pickup Person ” as “ Kim Thompson ” .
If a photo ID is required , how did the box get signed for without an ID verifying the identity of the pickup person as “ Kim Thompson ” ?
The answer to this question is probably pretty simple – an employee had to have falsified the signature ( a state felony as defined by KS 21-3710 ) and then stolen the package my mother had paid for ( a state misdemeanor or felony as defined by KS 21-3701 ) .
Since the package could have crossed state lines , this action could also violate various Federal Interstate Commerce regulations .
Also , the implication that anyone could forge an email by your online store and come in to pick up the package is troubling .
Being a web developer , I deal with internet security and e-commerce on a daily basis .
As such , your website should have adequate protections built in to prevent such happenings .
Also , in order to forge the order confirmation , one must know the order number , time of order , pickup person name , and credit card information .
As this information was passed from your servers via Secured Sockets Layer communication , it would be impossible for an outside source to intercept the encrypted content and decrypt it for personal use .
Internet security is not a joke , especially for someone who works in the industry .
Secondly , the way your store handled the situation was dysfunctional at best .
From the very beginning , no one at the store seemed to know or understand how the Site to Store worked , and the way the management and employees communicated with my mother was offensive .
Customer service should be a priority , especially in situations where it is possible that an employee stole merchandise belonging to a customer .
My mother being told she was “ not perfect ” is extremely unprofessional and borderline on childish behavior .
This kind of behavior is sickening from a company of your size .
Thirdly , if this can happen in Derby Kansas without anyone catching on , in how many of your other stores is this lack of oversight causing problems ?
How many other customers are going to be affected by similar incidents ?
This needs to be taken care of immediately .
As I mentioned earlier , I am the Editor - in - Chief of a website called PCMech.com .
I am publishing this letter as an Open Letter on the website to warn our audience of the dysfunctional status of Site to Store , and also to hopefully make your company accountable for the actions of your employees .
This letter will be featured in a newsletter which is received in the inbox of over 25,000 people , and visible on the internet to our audience of over 15,000 per day .
As an open letter , your company is free to respond openly on the website as a comment .
In order to make sure this letter is acted on , I will be mailing this to your corporate headquarters and to the Manager of the Derby Wal - Mart .
To rectify this situation , we would like to receive a written apology from both the corporate office and the Derby Wal - Mart , as well as have action taken as necessary against the employees involved in this situation .
I am saddened that it has to be taken this far , but in light of the treatment we received ; I feel the situation can not be ignored .
Thank you for your time .

MEXICO CITY ( AP )  Mexican President Felipe Calderón on Wednesday accused U.S. presidential candidates of " anti-Mexican " posturing and asked the U.S. Congress not to impose conditions on a $ 1.4 billion anti-drug aid package .
" The only theme in the ( U.S. ) electoral campaign is to compete to see who can be the most swaggering , macho and anti-Mexican , " Calderón told a local radio station , Enfoque .
He did not name any particular candidate or party .
CAMPAIGN ISSUE : 2008 candidates on immigration Mexico 's government has expressed disappointment at President Bush 's inability to change U.S. immigration policy to legalize the status of millions of undocumented Mexican workers in the USA .
Calderón has urged change since taking office a year ago , but he has championed the issue less vocally than his predecessor , Vicente Fox .
" I find the greatest sensitivity in the U.S. government , some in Congress , " Calderón said .
He said there was a " lack of understanding and aggravation , hostility toward Mexico " among Americans in general .
Calderón , who rarely gives interviews , is a conservative leader who has generally favored Washington 's policies on trade and anti-drug efforts .
He has made cracking down on drug smugglers a centerpiece of his administration , and U.S. drug enforcement agencies credit his efforts with a decline in cocaine supply in many U.S. cities .
However , Calderón appeared to reject any added conditions on a proposed $ 1.4 billion U.S. anti-drug aid package that had been negotiated with Washington , saying , " I can not accept any submission or subordination . "
The proposal , dubbed the Merida Initiative , is meant to give Mexico aid , training and equipment to fight drug trafficking , which Washington sees as a U.S. national security problem .
The funding still awaits approval in Congress , and some U.S. legislators have said the program may need safeguards to prevent corruption or human rights abuses by Mexican military and law enforcement personnel .
" I need that technology , " Calderón said .
" Give it to me .
And give it to me without conditions . "
Calderón also criticized U.S. involvement in Iraq , saying U.S. leaders were " spending Americans ' money and putting the government into debt to finance their military adventure , and that is squeezing out private investment . "
Fox 's refusal to endorse military action against Iraq in a 2003 United Nations vote led to cooler relations between Mexico and the United States .

Brief Overview
An experimental sub- project , Yhc Core to Javascript Converter ( ycr2js ) , is aimed to create a tool that generates Javascript out of a binary Yhc core file .
The project was started as an experimental patch to nhc98 in attempt to convert its internal PosLambda constructs into Javascript expressions .
After some initial success , the project was switched to use the Yhc Core as the source for transformation .
Recently , with a great amount of help from the Yhc Team , the project has been integrated into the main
Yhc source tree and is moving towards closer integration with the compiler .
Ability to convert an arbitrary Haskell source into Javascript makes it possible to execute Haskell programs in a Web browser .
This , in turn , allows for development of both client and server sides of an Internet application entirely in Haskell .
Server side solutions in Haskell have been around for a while , such as HAppS -- Haskell Application Server , Haskell Server Pages , and others .
For the client side , HSPClientSide has been recently introduced , which is a close analog to ycr2js .
HSPClientSide provides a domain - specific language to define the client side Web page structure ( static HTML and Javascript ) .
On the contrary , ycr2js helps convert any compilable Haskell source into Javascript .
Principles of Operation
The Yhc compiler generally produces a binary bytecode file ( usually named with .hbc extension ) for each Haskell module compiled .
These bytecode files are to be interpreted by yhi , a command - line bytecode interpreter .
The compiler is also capable of producing a binary core file ( usually named with .ycr extension ) , and also its human - readable representation for each Haskell module compiled .
The internal structure of core is based on significantly simplified nhc98's PosLambda constructs ( Yhc is derived from nhc98 code ) .
Core consists of definitions for compiled Haskell functions and data objects .
The feature of core linking was added recently to Yhc .
This allows for merging core files from several modules together , removing functions that are not used ( similar to static linking performed by a traditional Unix or Windows executable linker ) .
The resulting file ( usually named with .yca extension ) has the same format as per-module core files .
Binary core files may be read back into computer memory using the Yhc Core API functions .
The ycr2js program reads the binary core file specified ( .yca or .ycr ) , and performs conversion of Haskell functions compiled into Core to their Javascript representation storing the generated Javascript code in a file .
Resulting Javascript may be embedded on a ( X ) HTML page to be loaded into a Web browser .
If Mitt Romney hoped to quell concerns about his religious beliefs yesterday he failed miserably .
In fact , I believe he revealed himself in ways that should cause every American to worry more , not less , about what 's rattling around in this guy 's well - groomed head .
During his speech Romney made several pronouncements as though they were accepted facts .
Here are those statements , in his own words , followed by my reaction as I listened to his speech : ( Which I emailed to the Romney campaign headquarters as well . )
MITT : " Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom . "
ME : You 're only half right , Mitt .
The free and open practice of religion depends entirely on the freedom -- freedom to worship as one pleases , or not to worship at all .
But freedom itself is not so constrained .
Freedom , unlike religion , is the natural state of being .
It 's how humans would live unless one of two outside , artificial forces step in and restrict freedom .
Those two forces are government and religion .
Each of those two forces have , in more ways than can be counted over the eons , done more to restrict human freedom than any other forces in the universe .
You 're only half right , Mitt .
The free and open practice of religion dependson the freedom -- freedom to worship as one pleases , or not to worship at all .
But freedom itself is not so constrained .
Freedom , unlike religion , is the natural state of being .
It 's how humans would live unless one of two outside , artificial forces step in and restrict freedom .
Those two forces are government and religion .
Each of those two forces have , in more ways than can be counted over the eons , done more to restrict human freedom than any other forces in the universe .
MITT : " Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God . "
ME : Freedom also opens the windows of the mind which for many leads humans to discover that religions -- all of them -- are remnants of primitive mankind 's fear of the unknown and unknowable .
Religious ceremonies were -- and remain -- mankind 's feeble attempts to reassure itself they could have some control over the gigantic natural forces that surrounded them and which nurtured them one day and tried to kill them the next .
So they turned to magic and prayers ( How prayers are really treated ) Freedom also opens the windows of the mind which for many leads humans to discover that religions -- all of them -- are remnants of primitive mankind 's fear of the unknown and unknowable .
Religious ceremonies were -- and remain -- mankind 's feeble attempts to reassure itself they could have some control over the gigantic natural forces that surrounded them and which nurtured them one day and tried to kill them the next .
MITT : " Freedom and religion endure together , or perish alone . "
ME : You got that sound bite exactly backwards , Mitt .
Throughout human history it 's been the first goal of any religion to trim freedom 's wings .
The first thing a new religion does is to start making a list of things it wants people to stop doing .
And , as time goes on , those list grow .
They can never seem to stop with common sense rules like " do n't kill and steal from each other . "
Sooner or later the list of " sins " grow to include sexual behavior , what people can and can't eat and drink , what they can and can't say -- or even think , where they can and can't go , even what they can and can't wear .
So Mitt , you were dead wrong here .
Religion has always been at odds with freedom .
And the more freedom given to the religious , the less freedom the religious were willing to grant the ( once ) free .
MITT : " Given our grand tradition of religious tolerance and liberty , some wonder whether there are any questions regarding an aspiring candidate 's religion that are appropriate .
I believe there are . "
ME : Absolutely right , but not for the reasons you would cite , Mitt .
Two decades ago America 's Christian right decided their religious opposition to certain entirely secular behaviors needed to be outlawed or otherwise restricted , not by changing people 's minds , but by law .
That religious blacklist included abortion , condoms use by teens , birth control , foreign aid for family planning , same - sex marriages , gays , prayer in schools .. on and on .
Fundamentalist Christians pushed to elect leaders who promised to codify their shared religious beliefs into civil law .
And so it came to pass that millions of Americans who did not share those beliefs saw their freedoms eroded .
Choice , and choices , narrowed .
Freedoms narrowed .
Had that not occurred I would have no reason to care what religious dogma a candidate holds dear .
We secularists did n't start this fight , they did .
The so - called " war on religion in the public square " is a self - inflicted wound .
Because once one side breaches the barrier between church and state the other side will try to fill that breach .
MITT : " Americans do not respect believers of convenience .
Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs , even to gain the world . "
ME : Oh , man , what chutzpah .
Do you mean like you did when you were pro-choice to win the governorship of Mass .
and then switched to anti-choice to appeal to the religious right in the presidential primaries ?
So you mean someone just like you , Mitt .
MITT : " It 's important to recognize that while differences in theology exist between the churches in America , we share a common creed of moral convictions . "
ME : Well , excuuuuuuuse me for even existing , Mitt .
As a non -theist I , and tens of millions of Americans like me , do not share a common creed with theists .
We do not share your belief in the spirit - world .
Rather than sharing those beliefs we reject belief is the supernatural .
MITT : " We separate church and state affairs in this country , and for good reason .
No religion should dictate to the state nor should the state interfere with the free practice of religion . "
ME : Is that why the Christian right been insisting that its theologically - based moral codes be imposed on our entire population ?
Is that why the current " born - again " President has been stacking government agencies , such as the Federal Drug Administration to the courts , Health and Human Services , the Department of Justice , even the Supreme Court , with those who share the narrow beliefs of fundamentalist Christian sects ?
What does the term " separation " mean to you Mitt -- separating us from the freedom to live as we each wish ?
MITT : " But in recent years , the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning .
They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God ...
They wish to remove all mention of religion from the public square . "
ME : Whew !
Where do I begin ?
First of all , in a free country , the public square is a debating society , not a lecture hall .
If you come to the public square espousing your beliefs expect an argument .
When you say people like me want to chase religion from the public square what you are really saying is you do n't want us to challenge religious beliefs .
Well , forget about it .
Besides , people like you are yourself highly selective when it comes to just which metaphysical beliefs that are acceptable in the public squares .
Just let some believers in astrology erect a monument to astrology on a courthouse steps and see how fast mainstream religious folk scream foul .
MITT : " Religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life . "
ME : Yes , and that 's the right way to view it too .
There 's all kinds of things about other 's lives I have no interest in knowing about ; what they did in bed last night and with whom , who they voted for , how much money they earn and , right on the top of that list , their religious / metaphysical beliefs .
All that kind of stuff falls smack dab into the " do n't ask , do n't tell " category as far as I 'm concerned .
The only time I get concerned is when some group starts insisting that I believe and / or live as they do .
That 's when your religious beliefs stop being a private affair and becomes extremely personal -- to me .
MITT : " It is as if they 're ( secularists ) intent on establishing a new religion in America – the religion of secularism .
They 're wrong . "
( APPLAUSE )
ME : Ah , now , is n't THAT a telling comment .
You believe that people like me are trying to sneak a new religion into the mix -- " secularism . "
Do n't you see the irony in that remarkable remark ?
Was n't it your " prophet , " Joseph Smith , who himself " snuck " a new religion into the established Christian pack as recently as the 1830s ?
If I recall from my reading of history Smith was not viewed much differently than you now view we secularists .
But hey , maybe he 's given me an idea .
If the religious right is successful in finishing the job of breaking down the wall between church and state , the only way we secularists may be able to get what we want is to call ourselves a religion .
Then we could demand our rights too .
We could demand that our " religious beliefs " be codified into law too .
And , whenever we are opposed by anyone we can accuse them of " religious persecution . "
Then we too could take advantage of all those juicy tax breaks religions get .
( The Church of Secularism ... services every weekend starting at 9 pm at Filmore East -- Hymns by the Greatful Dead . )
MITT : " The founders proscribed the establishment of a state religion , but they did not countenance the elimination of religion from the public square .
We are a nation ' Under God ' and in God , we do indeed trust .
" We should acknowledge the Creator as did the Founders – in ceremony and word .
He should remain on our currency , in our pledge , in the teaching of our history , and during the holiday season , Nativity scenes and Menorahs should be welcome in our public places .
( APPLAUSE )
ME : I know you have trouble seeing it from your vantage , but Islam is one the fastest growing religions in the US .
What happens if the day arrives when Muslims outnumber Christians in the US ?
Would you be for changing the pledge and currency to , " In Allah We Trust ? " I Did n't think so .
Seems your religious tolerance has its limits .
Well , mine too .
MITT : " Our greatness would not long endure without judges who respect the foundation of faith upon which our Constitution rests .
I will take care to separate the affairs of government from any religion , but I will not separate us from ' the God who gave us liberty . '
( APPLAUSE )
ME : I thought George Washington gave us liberty .
I thought it was the courage and valor of George and all the men and women who died over the past couple of centuries to defeat those who would take or freedoms away , who we honor for our liberties .
That 's where our liberty came from , and that 's where it 's defended .
And you dishonor those heroes whey you ascribe those victories to the intercession of a supernatural spirit .
Every time you do that you reduce those heroes to little more godly canon fodder .
MITT : " We ( Americans ) believe that every single human being is a child of God – "
ME : There you go again .
No Mitt , not every American b elieves " every single human being " is " a child of God . "
Many of us believe we are extraordinarily fortunate accidents of universal forces -- forces we are just beginning to unravel , but may be destined to never fully understand .
We believe we are creatures of the universe , maybe the only such creatures .
Maybe not the only such creatures .
Maybe we 're the smartest creatures in the universe , maybe not .
But rather than children of some supernatural being , we believe we are , as the song in Hair put it , " stardust . "
And that 's where our beliefs coincide : " From dust , to dust . "
MITT : " Americans acknowledge that liberty is a gift of God , not an indulgence of government .
( APPLAUSE )

A VICTORY for consumers and the free market .
That was how the European Commission presented this week 's ruling by European judges in favour of its multi-million euro fine on Microsoft for bullying competitors .
American observers had qualms .
Would a French company have been pursued with such vigour ?
Explain again why a squabble among American high - technology firms ends up being decided in Brussels and Luxembourg ( where Euro - judges sit ) ?
One congressman muttered about sneaky protectionism and “ zealous European Commission regulators ” .
It certainly seemed zealous of the competition commissioner , Neelie Kroes , to say that a “ significant drop ” in the software giant 's market share was “ what we 'd like to see ” .
More broadly , the ruling confirms that Brussels is becoming the world 's regulatory capital .
The European Union 's drive to set standards has many causes — and a protectionist impulse within some governments ( eg , France 's ) may be one .
But though the EU is a big market , with almost half a billion consumers , neither size , nor zeal , nor sneaky protectionism explains why it is usurping America 's role as a source of global standards .
A better answer lies in transatlantic philosophical differences .
The American model turns on cost - benefit analysis , with regulators weighing the effects of new rules on jobs and growth , as well as testing the significance of any risks .
Companies enjoy a presumption of innocence for their products : should this prove mistaken , punishment is provided by the market ( and a barrage of lawsuits ) .
The European model rests more on the “ precautionary principle ” , which underpins most environmental and health directives .
This calls for pre-emptive action if scientists spot a credible hazard , even before the level of risk can be measured .
Such a principle sparks many transatlantic disputes : over genetically modified organisms or climate change , for example .
In Europe corporate innocence is not assumed .
Indeed , a vast slab of EU laws evaluating the safety of tens of thousands of chemicals , known as REACH , reverses the burden of proof , asking industry to demonstrate that substances are harmless .
Some Eurocrats suggest that the philosophical gap reflects the American constitutional tradition that everything is allowed unless it is forbidden , against the Napoleonic tradition codifying what the state allows and banning everything else .
Yet the more proscriptive European vision may better suit consumer and industry demands for certainty .
If you manufacture globally , it is simpler to be bound by the toughest regulatory system in your supply chain .
Self - regulation is also a harder sell when it comes to global trade , which involves trusting a long line of unknown participants from far - flung places ( talk to parents who buy Chinese - made toys ) .
A gripping new book * by an American , Mark Schapiro , captures the change .
When he began his research , he found firms resisting the notion that the American market would follow EU standards for items like cosmetics , insisting that their American products were already safe .
But as the book neared completion , firm after firm gave in and began applying EU standards worldwide , as third countries copied European rules on things like suspected carcinogens in lipstick .
Even China is leaning to the European approach , one Procter & Gamble executive tells Mr Schapiro , adding wistfully : “ And that 's a pretty big country . ”
The book records similar American reactions to the spread of EU directives insisting that cars must be recycled , or banning toxins such as lead and mercury from electrical gadgets .
Obey EU rules or watch your markets “ evaporating ” , a computer industry lobbyist tells Mr Schapiro .
“ We 've been hit by a tsunami , ” says a big wheel from General Motors .
American multinationals that spend money adjusting to European rules may lose their taste for lighter domestic regulations that may serve only to offer a competitive advantage to rivals that do not export .
Mr Schapiro is a campaigner for tougher regulation of American business .
Yet you do not have to share his taste for banning chemicals to agree with his prediction that American industry will want stricter standards to create a level playing - field at home .
Winning the regulatory race
One American official says flatly that the EU is “ winning ” the regulatory race , adding : “ And there is a sense that that is their precise intent . ”
He cites a speech by the trade commissioner , Peter Mandelson , claiming that the export of “ our rules and standards around the world ” was one source of European power .
Noting that EU regulations are often written with the help of European incumbents , the official also claims that precaution can cloak “ plain old - fashioned protectionism in disguise ” .
Europe had no idea the rest of the world was going to copy its standards , retorts a Eurocrat sweetly .
“ It 's a very pleasant side - effect , but we set out to create the legislation we thought that Europe needed . ”
At all events , America 's strategy has changed .
Frontal attempts to block new EU regulations are giving way to efforts to persuade Brussels to adopt a more American approach to cost - benefit analysis .
That would placate students of rigour , who accuse some European governments of ignoring scientific data and pandering to consumer panic ( as shown by European campaigns against “ Frankenstein foods ” ) .
But rigour can quickly look like rigidity when it involves resisting competition .
There is a genuine competition to set global regulatory standards , as Europe and America have discovered .
There are also rising protectionist pressures .
Perhaps zealous EU regulators may be what jumpy consumers need if they are to keep faith with free trade and globalisation .
Viewed in such a light , even Microsoft 's champions might hope that this week 's verdict will help global competition in future .

Josh sez , " The folks at BMC ( Black Mustang Club ) automotive forum wanted to put together a calendar featuring members ' cars , and print it through CafePress .
Photos were submitted , the layout was set , and …
CafePress notifies the site admin that pictures of Ford cars can not be printed .
Not just Ford logos , not just Mustang logos , the car - as a whole - is a Ford trademark and its image can't be reproduced without permission .
So even though Ford has a lineup of enthusiasts who want to show off their Ford cars , the company is bent on alienating them .
' Them ' being some of the most loyal owners and future buyers that they have .
Or rather , that they had , because many have decided that they will not be doing business with Ford again if this matter is n't resolved . "
I got some more info from the folks at cafepress and according to them , a law firm representing Ford contacted them saying that our calendar pics ( and our club 's event logos – anything with one of our cars in it ) infringes on Ford 's trademarks which include the use of images of THEIR vehicles .
Also ,
Ford claims that all the images , logos and designs OUR graphics team made for the BMC events using Danni are theirs as well .
Funny , I thought Danni 's title had my name on it … and I thought you guys owned your cars … and , well … I 'm not even going to get into how wrong and unfair I feel this whole thing is as I 'd be typing for hours , but I wholeheartedly echo everything you guys have been saying all afternoon .
I 'm not letting this go un-addressed and I 'll keep you guys posted as I get to work on this .
I 'm sorry , but at this point we will not be producing the 2008 BMC Calendar , featuring our 2007 Members of the Month , solely due to Ford Motor Company 's claim that THEY own all rights to the photos YOU take of YOUR car .
I hope to resolve this soon , and be able to provide the calendar and other BMC merchandise that you guys want and deserve !
This thread will remain open for you to comment however you wish , and I 'll update it as needed .

For $ 45 million , Macrovision will get ownership of the Self - Protecting Digital Content ( SPDC ) technology that forms the basis for BD + as well as associated patents owned by Cryptography Research .
Both Blu-ray and HD DVD use AACS to thwart copying , but that was cracked last spring .
Blu-ray is alone in using an additional layer of security , BD+ , to keep users from copying Blu-ray discs .
BD + works via a small virtual machine that is launched each time a disc is inserted .
The VM does some code transformation to correct deliberately - corrupted video streams , and checks to see if the disc is playing on a Blu-ray player known to have been hacked .
If the player has been compromised in the past , playback can be disabled .
When the disc is ejected , the VM disappears from memory , which , in theory , makes it more difficult to hack or reverse engineer .
One small problem : BD + was hacked earlier this month by SlySoft , makers of AnyDVD .
The crack made good the company 's boast that a crack would be available by year end and called into serious question the claims made by Blu-ray 's backers that BD + was uncrackable .
With the crack , users of AnyDVD make copies of the movies for fair use purposes .
Mandatory Managed Copy is part of the Blu-ray spec , but has yet to be implemented , meaning that there 's no way for Blu-ray disc owners to legally copy the discs .
Despite the recent cracks , Macrovision is excited about owning BD +.
" The integration of SPDC into our product portfolio will enable us to continue to provide innovative technology to our customers as they expand their distribution vehicles , " said Macrovision CEO Fred Amoroso in a statement .
" Not only is BD + critical for content security , but it also supports value - added features that enhance the consumer playback experience , such as potentially unlocking bonus content . "
Even if BD + has been dented and its long - term viability is uncertain , it 's still an important acquisition for Macrovision .
The DRM company will now rake in the dough for BD + licenses paid by the studios backing Blu-ray and will turn its expertise towards fighting hackers intent on defeating BD +.
THE GERMAN RESCUE BUOY
The Germans have developed deluxe buoys for flyers of the Luftwaffe brought down while operating over the English Channel .
The Rettungsboje was constructed under the direction of the German Ministry of Air Navigation in 1941 at the suggestion of Generaloberst Ernest Udet .
These buoys , called Generalluftzeugmeister after their sponsor , are anchored far offshore .
They have saved many German airmen that ships or coastal planes might have been too late to rescue .
The buoys are of square or hexagonal construction and have a floor space of about 43 square feet with an 8 - foot cabin rising above the float .
On the upper deck of this cabin , there is an oval turret 6 feet high with a signal mast carrying a wireless antenna .
Tube railings to which the distressed flyers may cling run along the outer circumference below and above the water line .
A ladder leads up to the turret , in which there is a door opening into the cabin below .
A 320 - foot red and yellow striped rope anchors the buoy at a fixed location , but allows a limited drift , thereby indicating the direction of the current to aircraft in distress .
The buoy is painted light yellow above the water line , and red crosses against white oval backgrounds are painted on each side of the turret .
The cabin accommodates four persons comfortably for several days , and in an emergency , the crews of several aircraft can be taken care of .
It is electrically lighted by storage batteries , but in case of a breakdown kerosene lamps or other lighting devices are provided .
There are two double - deck beds and adequate cupboard space for first - aid equipment , dry clothing and shoes , emergency rations , and a water supply .
Hot food may be prepared on an alcohol stove .
Cognac to relieve chill and cigarettes to quiet the nerves are also provided .
Games , stationery , playing cards , etc. afford diversion until rescue is effected .
Depleted supplies are always immediately replaced upon the arrival of the rescue ship .
A tubular lifeboat is available for transferring the downed aviators from the buoy to the ship .
Signalling is accomplished by hoisting a black anchor ball and a yellow and red striped flag on the mast during the day .
At night , red and white lights in the turret indicate that rescued men are on board .
A white anchor light on the mast is visible for 3,000 feet or more .
SOS signals giving the location of the buoy are automatically sent out by an emergency wireless transmitter .
Signal pistols with red and white lights , white - light parachute flares , or a smoke , distress - signalling apparatus complete the signalling equipment .
Other equipment includes plugs to stop up bullet holes in the walls of the cabin and a pump for the expulsion of seepage .
The accompanying sketches illustrate these buoys .

The U.S. was founded as an anti-monarchist nation .
The idea was that a kingdom was antithetical to the notion of freedom and democracy .
Today the U.S. is so deeply " embedded " with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that one might say they have become joined at the hip , or the purse .
George W. Bush told the American people that he was going to the Middle East last week to bring peace to the region .
He lied .
His real purpose was to go to the region as a salesman .
And he made quite a deal .
Bush delivered promises to the region of weapons sales in the amount of $ 20 billion .
That is quite a haul for the military industrial complex .
As a way to make this deal palatable to the American people he made lots of bold and threatening comments about Iran 's desire to take over the region .
Thus Bush portrayed himself as a protector of the holy crown .
The arms sales deal includes $ 123 million worth of precision - guided bombs to Saudi Arabia so they can continue to hold off opposition to their authoritarian kingdom .
The United Arab Emirates coughed up $ 9.763 billion for a Patriot missile defense system and upgrades to early warning aircraft .
Kuwait will get $ 1.691 billion worth of missiles and upgrades to its Patriot missile system .
Much more will be disclosed at a later date when no one is paying any attention .
Congress has 30 days to block the weapons sales .
They wo n't need the deadline because they will not do anything to stop it .
The Democrats , by and large , want the weapons contracts in their congressional districts because endless war is the industrial policy of America today .
Now you would think that Israel is upset about Bush handing out weapons to Arab countries .
But they are not .
Why ?
Because Washington , the Associated Press reports , has promised to counterbalance the sales to Arabs with new military " assistance " ( which probably means grants ) to the Jewish state -- a more than 25 % increase over the next 10 years .
Thus high and dry in the desert .
Arm all sides , keep the war footing high , drain the national treasury right before our eyes all the while convincing the American people they are protecting us from terrorism .
High and dry for sure .
From an email sent by Wexler 's office :
Today , in hearings on Capitol Hill , I confronted Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on her role in the lies , exaggerations , and misdirection that led us into the Iraq war .
During my questioning , Secretary Rice falsely stated that she never saw intelligence casting doubt on the Bush Administration claims that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction .
This unbelievable statement is flatly contradicted by numerous government reports and CIA testimonials .
Secretary Rice 's responses demonstrate once and for all that we need aggressive oversight over this out of control Administration .
Unfortunately , the Bush Administration has ignored the constitutional right of Congress to provide such oversight .
It is time Congress took aggressive action to assert our rights on behalf of the American people .
The House of Representatives must immediately hold former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten in contempt of Congress for their failure to respond to congressional subpoenas .
I have been aggressively lobbying Members of Congress to support a vote on contempt , and I am thrilled to report that Speaker Pelosi told me directly that she agrees it is well past time to vote on contempt .
I am anticipating that the House will shortly vote on resolutions of both civil and criminal contempt for both Miers and Bolten .
No one should be immune from accountability and the rule of law .
Every president since Richard Nixon has said the United States must end its reliance on foreign oil .
Yet today we import more petroleum than ever , and oil provides 96 percent of the fuel for our cars and trucks .
David Sandalow , former assistant secretary of state and member of the National Security Council under President Bill Clinton , says the next president can succeed where others have failed .
The trifecta of mounting concern about petroleum 's impact on national security , the environment and the economy provides an unprecedented opportunity to radically reshape national energy policy , says Sandalow , who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
His new book , Freedom From Oil : How the Next President Can End the United States ' Oil Addiction , offers a detailed plan for weaning us from oil within a generation .
" Oil dependence is a problem we can solve , " he said in a telephone interview .
" We have the political consensus and the technological opportunity .
This is a moment to seize . "
Sandalow drew upon his government experience , dozens of interviews and reams of documents – the 272 - page book includes 42 pages of footnotes – in crafting a six - point plan for our next leader :
1 . The country should begin transforming the transportation fleet to alternative fuels .
How ?
The government should begin converting its fleet to plug - in electric hybrid and flex - fuel vehicles .
The government should also provide Detroit with the capital to develop such vehicles by paying automakers ' retiree health care costs and backing battery warranties .
Consumers would receive tax credits of up to $ 8,000 for buying a plug - in hybrid .
These proposals would cost $ 13.5 billion over 10 years ; the health care plan would cost $ 500 million annually .
2 . The fuel supply should also be transformed by requiring all major fuel suppliers to retrofit half their pumps for E85 ( cost to suppliers : $ 300 million ) , extending the ethanol tax credit for 10 years ( cost to the government : $ 15 billion ) and requiring refiners to produce low - carbon gasoline .
3. Federal funding should also go towards mass transit and promotion of telecommuting rather than highway construction .
4. Research into all forms of renewable energy should receive $ 1 billion annually from the government .
5 . The government should increase the gasoline tax by 10 cents a gallon each year for five years , generating $ 65 billion .
Most of that money would be returned to taxpayers in annual rebates ; the rest would finance programs to ease our dependence on oil .
6 . Make clean fuels and energy efficiency a top diplomatic priority by encouraging America 's allies and trade partners – particularly China , where fuel needs are expected to quadruple by 2030 – to adopt similar efforts to wean themselves from petroleum .
Sandalow realizes some of his proposals are controversial , and he says they are n't the only way to address a problem policymakers increasingly agree must be solved .
He defended his plan in a phone interview with Wired News .
WN : What you propose will require a Manhattan Project or Apollo program level of commitment .
Sandalow : I call it the Reynolds Project .
I got the name from the town of Reynolds , Indiana .
It 's a town of 574 people , and they have decided they will use only renewable energy , nothing else .
The president of the town council , Charles van Voorst , told me , " It 's hard to get someone to believe in something that 's never happened before , " and I think that 's the basic problem with this challenge .
We all grew up with cars that relied on oil , so we think it 's the way of the world .
It does n't have to be that way .
WN : You place tremendous emphasis on converting our transportation fleet to electric plug - in hybrids .
Why ?
Sandalow : I believe electric plug - in hybrids are the most important part of the solution , but they 're only one part of the solution .
Oil provides 96 percent of the energy for our vehicles but only 3 percent of the energy for electric power generation .
If we could connect our cars and trucks to this infrastructure , the potential for reducing oil dependence dramatically , and in a short period of time , would be incredible .
WN : What about the argument that cars fueled by electricity from a coal - fired power plant ultimately are as polluting as cars using fossil fuels ?
Sandalow :
If you plug a first - generation into a coal - fired plant , you would still be producing fewer heat - trapping gases than you would driving the average car powered by oil .
But the real win is to plug these cars into renewable energy sources like wind and solar .
WN : Why not call for electric vehicles ?
Sandalow :
We should experiment with both .
My opinion is we 'll start with plug - in electric hybrids and work our way to full electric vehicles .
The leading example of the full electric car is the Tesla .
They have a great product .
But it 's a $ 98,000 car .
WN : Every president since Richard Nixon has said we need to address this issue .
Why have n't we made more progress ?
Sandalow : First , we have allowed ourselves to be whipsawed by trends in the oil market .
When prices dropped in the mid to late 1980s and '90s , we stopped paying attention to this issue .
Second , we 've focused on just a narrow part of the problem .
Our political dialog focuses much too much on imported oil as opposed to the problem of oil dependence .
The fundamental problem is 96 percent of the energy our cars and trucks use comes from oil .
We need to find other energy sources for our transportation fleet .
WN : : You drive an electric plug - in hybrid ?
WN : You 've suggested in the book that we need much tighter fuel - economy standards .
Do the standards President Bush recently signed into law go far enough ?
Sandalow : I think it was a good step forward and a historic advance .
But we can do more .
Unfortunately , the day after President Bush signed that legislation , the administrator of the EPA denied the application from California and more than a dozen other states to impose an even more visionary rule .
I have every hope that the next president will reverse that decision and we will soon see even stronger rules .
WN : In calling for a transformation of our fuel supply , you emphasize ethanol , biofuels and low - carbon gasoline .
Why do n't you include hydrogen ?
I 'm not optimistic about the chance of hydrogen to make a difference in the short or medium term .
I 'm not opposed to it , but there are two challenges when it comes to hydrogen .
The first is producing it .
It takes lots of energy and money to do that .
And then once we 've got the hydrogen , what do we do with it ?
We have no infrastructure for distributing hydrogen , and building one would be a gargantuan task and expense .
I think the biggest advances will come in ethanol and other biofuels .
WN : We 're in the midst of an era of tremendous research into alternative fuels , from cellulosic ethanol to algae .
Should our efforts be more focused ?
Sandalow :
We should be pursuing a wide range of possibilities with a combination of private sector and government funding .
Government funding should go into basic science and technologies that are furthest away from market applications .
No one can predict where the breakthroughs will come , and we need to be pursuing several options .
WN : You call for a significant shift in funding away from highways and toward mass transit .
How likely is that to happen , given current growth patterns toward suburbs and exurbs ?
Sandalow :
We do not have a level playing field for mass transit in this country .
If you 're a local government or a state government and you want money for a road , you have to prove less ( with regard to the project 's benefits ) and you get a higher percentage ( of the project 's cost ) in reimbursement from the federal government than if you want money for a mass - transit project .
That 's nuts , and we need to change that .
Our political system is used to dispensing money for roads , so it will take some changes in mindset .
WN : You suggest increasing the gas tax 10 cents a gallon a year for five years .
Four presidents have tried , and largely failed , to increase the gas tax .
Sandalow : I 've been around politics long enough to know that any tax proposal will immediately be met with widespread opposition .
One suggestion I have is to rebate some proceeds from the tax to middle - and low - income families .
The checks could be delivered during the summer , when families are taking vacations .
The remainder would be dedicated to programs that reduce our oil dependence .
WN : What 's the point of taxing consumers for gasoline , then returning the money to them ?
Sandalow :
It would change what people spend money on .
If people and the automakers knew gasoline taxes would rise , people would demand , and automakers would produce , more fuel - efficient vehicles .
It would encourage people to move away from gasoline .
The tax also would provide tax rebates on plug - in hybrid cars .
WN : Critics will consider your proposal an example of big government run amok .
Sandalow :
Our dependence on petroleum is the result of decades of support by big government .
There have been subsidies for the production of oil in the U.S. , preferential rates for the production of oil on public land , subsidies for road building .
But the fundamental role the government has played has been ensuring the oil flows and promoting its safe transit around the world .
Big government already plays a central role .
The only question is are we going to use big government to move away from oil , or to continue its dominance .
WN : What about the argument that the market should decide the best course and government should stay out of the way ?
Sandalow :
If you are a free - market purist and believe big government should n't be involved , then you would support withdrawing U.S. forces from the Persian Gulf , revoking the Carter Doctrine , adjusting the mission of CENTCOM , redefining our relationship with Saudi Arabia , eliminating all the preferences for domestic production and a whole lot of other things the government does to support oil .
Some people may support those things , but most people I 've talked to think they would be a bad idea .
WN : How hopeful are you that the next president will take at least some steps toward moving us beyond oil ?
Sandalow : Very hopeful .
I think a president from either party has a huge opportunity to hit the ball out of the park , particularly if the American people stand up and say this is something they care deeply about .
We 're hearing that .
This is a challenge the next president can , and I believe will , address .
Cash For Peerages : How The " Disease " That Forced Blair From Office Has Infected Brown
The same " disease " that forced Tony Blair from office has now infected his successor Gordon Brown .
Gordon Brown was able to take over the British Prime Minister 's office due to the over year long " Cash for Peerages " scandal .
The scandal involved Tony Blair and senior members of his Government and his Labour Party in the taking of large sums for " donations " and " loans " for honours ( knightships and the like ) and life peerages ( title of baron / baroness with the right to sit and vote in the upper chamber , the House of Lords , of the UK Parliament ) .
Now , only a few months after taking office it is Mr. Brown who is deeply mired in the same sticky mess .
The General Secretary of the British Labour Party , Mr. Peter Watt , has resigned and a leading London newspaper , The Telegraph , reports that " The Labour fund raising scandal has descended into open warfare between Gordon Brown and his deputy Harriet Harman after Ms. Harman effectively blamed the Prime Minister 's inner circle for her decision to accept an illegal donation . "
Ms. Harman is the Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party and a senior member of the British Cabinet ( Minister for Women and Equality ; prior to this she was Minister of State at the Department for Constitutional Affairs / Ministry of Justice from 2005 - 2007 ) .
Her husband , Jack Dromey , is the Treasure of the British Labour Party .
The Prime Minister has admitted that the Labour Party illegally accepted 670,000 pounds ( about US $ 1.34 million ) from David Abrahams .
Mr. Abrahams , who is also known as David Martin , used four front men / women to make the unreported donations in clear violation of United Kingdom law .
The Electoral Commission has referred the matter to the police and Scotland Yard is now preparing to launch a full - scale criminal inquiry .
Mr. Abrahams is reported to be Gordon Brown 's third biggest donor .
Assistant Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police John Yates , who headed the cash - for - peerages probe , will be advising the police investigation .
Ms. Harman 's husband , Labour Treasure Jack Dromey , claims to know nothing of the latest illegal donations to his party 's coffers .
This has prompted the Conservative Party Shadow Leader of the House of Commons , Theresa May , MP , to say to Ms. Harman , " You , the Prime Minister and the Labour Party Treasure are like the three wise monkeys .
You see no evil , hear no evil , and speak no evil . "
The Prime Minister 's senior people are claiming that neither he nor Jack Straw , the Lord Chancellor , knew anything of the illegal donations .
All of this is no surprise to me .
I know most of the people involved in the cash - for - peerages probe and supplied a large number of documents to the police at the personal request of Assistant Commission Yates .
In fact John Yates personally interviewed me and I spoke to and corresponded with a number of his senior investigators .
The information that I supplied the police team with could have put several senior cabinet ministers in prison including Ms. Harman .
It was a political deal , resulting in Tony Blair 's agreement to resign , that allowed all parties to walk away without doing serious prison time .
Even though I am an American ( from an old and famous Scottish family ) I am a former Scottish Editor at the famous London publishing / genealogical firm Burke 's Peerage .
I owned a Scottish castle for a dozen years ( with two feudal baronies ) and successfully claimed an historically important set of Scots Peerage titles in my clan .
In August of 1999 , after almost ten years of a public claim by right of succession , I used a Scots Peerage Law procedure ( an Assumption at Law ) to call out of dormancy the Earldom of Stirling , the Viscountcy of Canada , etc .
I was allowed to sit in the House of Lords as Lord Stirling on a trip to London in December 1999 .
What I did not offer to do , was to " donate " or " loan " the Labour Party a couple of million .
The going rate for a life peerage , under Blair was a " donation " or " loan " of over one million pounds ( about $ 2 million or more ) .
Of course , this was highly illegal under British Law but that did not stop Blair and his senior people .
There was a major effort to shake me down for a donation , but this tight Scotsman / American would not play or pay .
I brought a legal action on the issue of sexual equality before the European Court of Human Rights .
The Blair administration and specifically the Department for Constitutional Affairs / Lord Chancellor 's office were the focus of the shake down .
At one point they were so arrogant as to lie in writing and to do so in a way that constituted obstruction of justice before the European Court .
I wrote to Harriet Harman direct on this matter on July 6th and July 21st of 2005 and was answered ( and basically told to go to hell ) on July 22 , 2005 .
This directly involved her in the obstruction of justice issue and the cash for peerages issue .
As a former Solicitor General ( Law Officers Department 2001 - 2005 ) she was fully knowledgeable as to the seriousness of the matters , but Blair 's people were known for their arrogance and corruption .
That this woman was chosen as Cabinet Minister for Women and Equality is almost beyond belief .
I have written a book , CASH FOR PEERAGES : THE SMOKING GUN ( published by Lulu ; see www.lulu.com/content/953682), on this whole affair .
The interesting thing is that Tony Blair 's last ditch legal argument was that his recommending of the life peerages to donors was not illegal as they were to be " working peers " and therefor they were not receiving " honours " under the Honours ( Prevention of Abuse ) Act of 1925 .
As my case involved not only a possible life peerage but also a set of hereditary peerages it destroyed Tony Blair 's only legal defense , and the key people both on his side and those opposed to him , knew it .
The " tar baby " that destroyed Tony Blair seems to be sticking to Gordon Brown .
It will be interesting to see if he takes the necessary steps to disinfect himself and if he can do so quickly enough to save his premiership .

I had this pegged as a winner when I saw it , but did n't have a chance to vote .
I love the mistiness and the outlines of the trees , that is what made it special in my eyes .

Congratulations !

Wonderfull picture .
It really brings back memories of my childhood .
I used to live in Albuquerque and got up a few years at somewhere near 2 - 3 am to go work at the Balloon Fiesta .
Although I recognized the balloons , the trees just look amazaing and almost mystical .
Great framing and exposure , those early morning shots are hard to get , but when you do they are great !

Great photo , perfect point of view .
I was at one of those a few years ago , really impressive to watch
Photographer found comment helpful .
Congrats on the blue !!!
Photographer found comment helpful .
I remember when I was about 6 years old .
Lived out in Rio Rancho ( Avenida La Baranca ( sp ? ) ) and watching the ballonns .
My Dad owned a Texaco station near and raced cars also , so he was in real good with the GoodYear guys .
I got to ride in their balloon .
I remember watching the balloons for hours on end .
Last time I was down there in 2004 during the Balloonfest to see my Dad in Hospice .
We went outside and watched the balloons floating by .
He passed away in November of 2004 ( a month later ) at 62 .
Great memory to relive with him one last time .

Return for comment .
This is so beautiful !
What an incredible scene and capture .
I think it 's almost perfect .
The one change I 'd like to see is slightly more contrast or saturation in the sky area , to bring out the balloons a little more .
Just enough to make them sing without losing the lovely depth and layering you 've achieved here .
Good luck in the challenge - - into my favs !
Photographer found comment helpful .
Excellant love it 10
Photographer found comment helpful .
This is my top pick for blue , great shot !
I like this even better than your yellow ribbon a few months ago , better contrast , better balance between foreground and background .
And the balloons appear to be luminescent here , wonderful !
Photographer found comment helpful .
This is really wonderful , on of my favs so far .
The upper half seems a tad washed - out , perhaps from the haze .
Otherwise perfect !

What a great shot .
Great control over the varied lighting .

For the first time in a long time , I have seen a photograph that literally took my breath away .

Wow , to be in one of these balloons , would be just amazing , looking down on that magic scenery below .
This is just so special .
Just one of those magic moments , one only finds once in a lifetime .....
The mist in the trees give it such a magical feel .
I also love how one , two , three , four , five and half balloons , are partically covered with misty trees , WOW , thats something so special .....
I think you are amazing , and hope you do well in this challenge .

Wow !
Photographer found comment helpful .
This is a case of being in the right place at the right time , and knowing how to totally capitalize on it !
Very cool shot .
Photographer found comment helpful .
The bird is either really distracting or an excellent touch .
I 'm leaning towards the former because the photo is great without it and it draws my eyes away from the wonderful balloons .
Photographer found comment helpful .
Wow , what a sight !
The mist is really nice and I like the way the sunlight has made some of the balloons look transparent .

This is really pretty but I find the black bird (? ) in the near center a distraction to an otherwise very serene photo .

This is a very special picture .
Soft and bright at the same time .
Almost mystic , but soothing .

Wonderful coloration / composition ; very soft and peaceful .
With bird in the forground could have been called " modes of flight " /
Amazing how the mist and trees seem to mirror the clouds and sky .

I thought the thumbnail was pretty good but upon opening the image & seeing that bird in the foreground , I have to say that really makes the shot excellant to me .

Photographer found comment helpful .
You have captured the morning light so perfectly here , I am stunned .
The baloons are fine and do no harm .
The sky is fine and does no harm .
But the reality is that they are simply context for the bottom 2/3 of the image which is superb .
Well done .

I 've got some baloon pictures in my portfolio as well so you might want to have a look .
do n't think they are quit as good as this though .

the only thing that might improve this , is wheter is is possible to have a bit more space on the top and left and right next to the most outer baloons ... but it 's pretty perfect as it is !
well done

This is ' photography as a means to share a spectacle ' at its very best .
Dodge and burning perhaps taken a little too far but overall an exceptional capture .

This seems familiar .
I like this one better than the ( assumed ) one in my memory .
The layers of distance are great , the dimensions are emphasized by the bird which other might find destracting .
I also like the pale colours of the balloons .
10 . Adding to favs .
Photographer found comment helpful .
Incredible landscape , with a painting - like quality to it .
My only quibble -- the bird in the foreground ...
It stands out and distracts from the rest of the image .
Maybe some dodging to minimize it or even cloning it out would work .
Still , well - done !
Photographer found comment helpful .
pretty colors - they look pastel like .
I like how they are rising above the clouds .
Photographer found comment helpful .
Perfect with the haze on the balloons .
Nice with the bird in the foreground .

Had a 9 for you , bumping up to 10 .
Ca n't really find anything to complain about in this one .
The composition is fantastic , no ballons are cut off at all .
The light is unrealy with the mist coming through the trees , and to have that bird in the foreground really brings the title you chose home .
Incredible work .

What a sight that must have been in person - thanks for sharing it !
Photographer found comment helpful .
OH WOW - what would happen if you did a saturation of blue , cyan , red and yellow ?
Play with curves a little .
I know that it 's a misty morning , but it might really give it more pop .
I like the bird 's silhouette in the foreground .
Compositionally , it 's great !!
Photographer found comment helpful .
This is aMAZING !!!!
I love the misty look of the clouds hanging over the trees .
I love the bird , and those cheerful balloons .
This is definitely a " Best of " contender !!!!

You 've captured the light and morning mis so wonderfully !
I love the way the mist gives depth by creating halos around the tree tops and also the way the sun lights up many of the balloons .

What a cool scene !
My first 10 of the '05 challenge .
Photographer found comment helpful .
When I give a photo a 10 , it is because I feel it is wonderfual all the way around .
Therefore , I have no real comment other than to say I gave you a 10 !
Photographer found comment helpful .
Nice lighting !
Photographer found comment helpful .
WoW !!
All I can say is a 10
Photographer found comment helpful .
I really like the play of colors and overall scenery in this particular shot ;-)
The colors of the balloons are not only a wonderful splash of color to the landscape of the sky but the sometimes pastel soft colors compliment ( act in partnership ) to the soft warm / dark colors of the forested landscape dominating the foreground .
The fog / mist rolling off of the landscape softens the look and turns it into a magical scene .
What I really like about this one is all the soft ( not overly brilliant and vibrantly bold ) colors that are seen throughout the composition .
I really feel the soft light of the morning as these balloons rise and take flight .
Also something that is a real shame that it was not better lit - the bird that is seen in flight in the foreground would have really added an extra special touch to the overall scene .
We see it 's shape but it is a dark silhouette that if better lit would be a companion to the other main objects in flight in this photo .
Photographer found comment helpful .
Magical scene , made even more magical by your photographic ability to capture the scene with stunning composition .
David Leonhardt weighs in .
The other day John Nye and I were discussing that de facto limits on the size of effective bets are the biggest problem hindering effective price discovery .
When you can become a millionaire on InTrade , that ’s when its prices will become much better forecasters .
Nonetheless I agree with the piece ’s conclusion :
If you have any better ideas of where to look , let me know .
But some inefficiencies need to be taken with a grain of salt :
Mr. Ravitch has made a nice profit betting against Ron Paul ,
the libertarian who late last year was , amazingly , given almost a 10
percent chance of becoming the Republican nominee .
“ If you asked anyone
in politics whether there was ever , at any point , a 10 percent chance
of Ron Paul being the nominee , ” Mr. Ravitch said , without finishing the
sentence .
“ That sort of makes my case for me . ”
When it comes to the long shots , remember that InTrade takes deposits in non-interest - bearing cash rather than T - Bills .
In the meantime observers need to adjust their expectations accordingly and not interpret all the prices are pure percentages .
I recall Paul trading at about 7 or 8 percent .
Let ’s say you shorted Paul last December .
You ’re locking up your cash for quite a while at zero percent interest and when Paul fails you ’re not going to net as much as you thought .
In other words , there is a partial short sale constraint on this market and its prices need to be understood accordingly .
Of course there is a reason why InTrade insists on earning the float and that directs our attention back to the zero-sum property of the bets .
That ’s another reason why prediction markets probably wo n’t ever forecast as well as the stock market : their users have to be charged or taxed at a higher rate .
The expected rate of return in InTrade is negative ; the expected rate of return in the stock market is seven percent minus commissions .
Where would you rather put your smarts to work ?
Everything you wanted to know about Social Media and Barack Obama
In a ceremony that received virtually no attention in the American media , the United States and Canada signed a military agreement Feb. 14 allowing the armed forces from one nation to support the armed forces of the other nation during a domestic civil emergency , even one that does not involve a cross - border crisis .
The agreement , defined as a Civil Assistance Plan , was not submitted to Congress for approval , nor did Congress pass any law or treaty specifically authorizing this military agreement to combine the operations of the armed forces of the United States and Canada in the event of a wide range of domestic civil disturbances ranging from violent storms , to health epidemics , to civil riots or terrorist attacks .
Apparently it's not enough that the federal government is permitting the civilian invasion of America by its neighbors , now it intends to permit open military invasion as well Somehow , I doubt the " domestic civil disturbances " they have in mind have anything to do with the ones mentioned , but rather refer to those Americans who tend to take their Constitutional inheritence from their revolutionary Founding Fathers a little too literally for an ironically named Washington 's taste .
When you toast the New Year with a flute of champagne or down a glass of your favorite red wine on the weekends , it can actually be good news for your body :
One glass a day ( or less ) can make your heart stronger and may boost your memory .
Alcoholic beverages have no fat and usually have fewer calories than popular non-alcoholic beverages .
But have a few too many , and your risks for breast cancer , uterine cancer , and osteoporosis rise fast .
So when it comes to drinking , should you or should n't you ?
Here , experts make sense of the contradictions and help four drinkers ( and one abstainer ) find the healthiest imbibing strategy .
Can a glass a day keep the doctor - and the pounds - away ?
Gabrielle Studenmund , age 31 , of Southern Pines , North Carolina , is trying to lose 10 to 20 pounds from her 5 - foot - 5 , 155 - pound figure .
She takes three - mile walks every day and watches calories carefully , but wonders whether giving up the glass of white wine ( or sometimes two ) that she has every night with dinner would make losing weight easier .
At the same time , she does n't want to say no if wine is really helping her stave off Alzheimer 's , a heart attack , or some other scary disease .
What the experts say
The wine is probably doing more good than ill .
In a study of almost 50,000 women , those who drank moderately ( one drink per day ) gained less weight than women who abstained -- and less than those who had two or more drinks per day .
It 's not clear why , but study author Eric Rimm , associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health , thinks that alcohol may help burn calories .
Plus , alcoholic beverages have no fat and typically have fewer calories than popular non-alcoholic beverages .
A 5 - ounce glass of red wine has 125 calories , for instance , but a Venti cappuccino from Starbucks weighs in at 180 .
Still , Gabrielle needs to watch what she eats when she 's drinking .
Since alcohol often lowers inhibitions , she runs the risk of noshing to excess .
To avoid that problem , it 's best to portion out your goodies beforehand and put away leftovers quickly , says Katherine Zeratsky , a registered dietitian for the Mayo Clinic .
Health Minute : Watch out for alcohol 's calories »
Down the road , Gabrielle 's well - behaved taste for wine should pay off in a lower risk for dementia , heart disease , and certain cancers .
Alcohol may keep her brain sharp by increasing blood flow upstairs , says David Hanson , founder of AlcoholInformation.org and professor emeritus of sociology at the State University of New York at Potsdam .
Moderate drinking also seems to raise HDL ( good ) cholesterol and lower LDL ( bad ) cholesterol , while decreasing blood pressure .
It may even cut the risk of type 2 diabetes by improving the body 's sensitivity to insulin .
How does alcohol pull all that off ?
Nobody knows for sure , Hanson says , although the calorie burning and improvements in blood chemistry linked to drinking may explain it .
Health.com : Six reasons to drink wine
Will drinking too much make me age faster ?
Lisa Concepcion Giassa , 36 , of Bogota , New Jersey , goes out every other night during the week with the girls for a pitcher of margaritas or sangria , and downs two to three drinks per outing .
On the weekends she gets a little more crazy .
" For me , " she says , " it 's five drinks and three shots , with water in between . "
She prides herself on being the one who can put it away and still have her wits about her .
Lisa is n't oblivious to the immediate dangers -- like car accidents or simply falling down -- but she 's more worried about premature aging and the risks of a disease like breast cancer or osteoporosis .
What the experts say
Alcohol by itself wo n't make Lisa look old before her time .
However , Rimm says , " Partyers tend to eat miscellaneous things at the bar ( like greasy nachos , cheesy potato skins , and chicken wings ) that are n't great for them , " which can lead to that chunky , middle - aged look .
People who drink this way are also more likely than nondrinkers to smoke and to breathe in secondhand smoke in bars , which contributes to wrinkles and higher risks of heart disease and cancer .
Alcohol may also dehydrate you , and that 's never good for the skin .
But the real problem with binge drinking -- or even just two drinks a day for women -- is the toll it takes on the inside of your body , not the outside .
" If you have more than seven drinks per week , it actually reduces bone mass , " says Janet Greenhut , M.D. , MPH , senior medical consultant at HealthMedia , which provides online behaviorial help , like alcohol counseling , for health plans and employers .
" Also , if someone is in the habit of binge drinking -- having four or more drinks in a two - hour period -- she 's more prone to falls , and she 's at higher risk for fracture because her bone mass is lower . "
Studies clearly show , too , that more than one drink a day makes you more prone to breast cancer .
Researchers at the European Cancer Conference recently reported that the risk rises 10 percent for women who have between one and two drinks a day , compared with women who have less than one , and the risk increases by 30 percent at more than three drinks per day .
And do n't think you lower the risk by drinking wine instead of beer or something harder .
The same research says any kind of alcohol ups the risk .
Uterine - cancer risks go up at two or more drinks per day , as well .
What does alcohol have against breasts and uteruses ?
Experts say it seems to boost estrogen levels , which in some cases cranks up cancer risks .
Does having a drink or two take a toll on my energy ?
Eliana Agudelo , 33 , of San Francisco , California , loves rock climbing , hiking , and marathons .
" It 's part of who I am , " she says .
" Being outdoors makes me feel alive , energetic , and connected to the Earth . "
She also loves a good microbrew after a day outdoors and a glass of wine a few nights a week .
She wants to know whether she 'd stay in better shape or have more energy if she did n't drink at all .
What the experts say
A few drinks a week should n't affect Eliana 's performance , says Eric Rimm , a professor at Harvard School of Public Health , whether she 's at the gym , in a road race , or on the trail .
However , if alcoholic drinks end up cutting into her water intake during the day , she may get dehydrated .
That can leave anyone feeling tired and less eager to work out .
One more thing : Eliana should deep - six any drinking right before an athletic event or outing , as it takes four to six hours for the body to break down alcohol .
Leave the beer at home , in other words , when you 're rock climbing , and get high on nature when you 're hiking .
Otherwise , the risk of a bad fall rises fast .
Could my drinking lead to alcoholism ?
The latest numbers from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism are discouraging :
One in three people will become hooked , to some degree , on alcohol at some point in their lives , and only one - quarter of people with a problem will get treated .
Connie Stelter , 41 , of St. Paul , Minnesota , has often wondered whether she might need help .
She currently has just two drinks a week , but it was n't long ago when four or five drinks three times a week was her norm .
The heavy drinking happened after she suffered a divorce , two job layoffs , a burglary , and then more relationship turmoil .
Now she worries she 'll end up like her brother , an alcoholic .
" I know my drinking has really curbed my potential , " she says .
Connie wants to know how to tell whether she really has a problem , and , if so , what to do next .
What the experts say
Just wondering if you have a problem is a strong hint that you might , says Kevin Wildenhaus , Ph.D. , director of behaviorial science for HealthMedia .
( Take a quick test to see whether you need to get help . )
Connie 's family history is another red flag .
" People who have a family history of alcoholism have about three times the risk of becoming alcoholics , " Rimm says .
" Some say that it could be that you grew up in a setting exposed to alcohol , but even those who grew up apart from their parents have a higher risk . "
Most experts classify alcoholism as a disease because of the genetic component and the tendency of some people to become psychologically and physically addicted .
They say that Connie should n't blame her brother for a personal failing .
That attitude may lead her to blame herself and not seek help if she really does have a problem .
Instead , Connie should talk to her doctor or a counselor .
Am I missing out on the benefits of drinking ?
Laura Faeth , 44 , of Boulder , Colorado , stopped drinking three years ago after experiencing a ton of abdominal pain during a night of partying .
" I took it as a sign that my body did n't want alcohol anymore , " she says .
Now she finds socializing just as much fun when she 's sober .
But since her father died of pancreatic cancer at age 53 and his mom died of breast cancer at 50 , Laura can't stop wondering whether she could lower her cancer risks by having some red wine every few days .
Health.com :
The latest on alcohol and breast cancer
What the experts say
Women who do n't drink at all do have a slightly higher risk for certain diseases than women who drink just a little .
But that 's no reason for Laura to start having wine with dinner in place of , say , water , or to throw down a few at the holiday party while toasting good health .
( For tips on avoiding alcohol , see " Sneaky Ways to Just Say ' No , ' " ) " We know so much about how to be healthy already , " Rimm says .
" If you 're worried about the risk of diabetes and you 're eating right , for example , adding alcohol wo n't do much more for you . "
The same goes for cancer : Ditching cigarettes , eating more fruits and veggies , avoiding too much sun exposure , keeping your weight under control , and getting regular exercise pack a lot more prevention than a bottle of Bordeaux .

Money Trouble
This is one of my favourite brain teasers .
It was first introduced to me some years ago in a Cambridge pub garden during ( if my memory serves me well ) the Bayesian Methods workshop at the Neural Networks and Machine Learning session at the Newton Institute .
There are many interpretations , but needless to say , I prefer the Bayesian ones .
The scene
You are taking part in a game show .
The host introduces you to two envelopes .
He explains carefully that you will get to choose one of the envelopes , and keep the money that it contains .
He makes sure you understand that each envelope contains a cheque for a different sum of money , and that in fact , one contains twice as much as the other .
The only problem is that you do n't know which is which .
The host offers both envelopes to you , and you may choose which one you want .
There is no way of knowing which has the larger sum in , and so you pick an envelope at random ( equiprobably ) .
The host asks you to open the envelope .
Nervously you reveal the contents to contain a cheque for 40,000 pounds .
The host then says you have a chance to change your mind .
You may choose the other envelope if you would rather .
You are an astute person , and so do a quick sum .
There are two envelopes , and either could contain the larger amount .
As you chose the envelope entirely at random , there is a probability of 0.5 that the larger check is the one you opened .
Hence there is a probability 0.5 that the other is larger .
Aha , you say .
You need to calculate the expected gain due to swapping .
Well the other envelope contains either 20,000 pounds or 80,000 pounds equiprobably .
Hence the expected gain is 0.5x20000+0.5x80000-40000 , ie the expected amount in the other envelope minus what you already have .
The expected gain is therefore 10,000 pounds .
So you swap .
Does that seem reasonable ?
Well maybe it does .
If so consider this .
It does n't matter what the money is , the outcome is the same if you follow the same line of reasoning .
Suppose you opened the envelope and found N pounds in the envelope , then you would calculate your expected gain from swapping to be 0.5 ( N/2) +0.5 ( 2N ) - N = N/4 , and as this is greater than zero , you would swap .
But if it does n't matter what N actually is , then you do n't actually need to open the envelope at all .
Whatever is in the envelope you would choose to swap .
But if you do n't open the envelope then it is no different from choosing the other envelope in the first place .
Having swapped envelopes you can do the same calculation again and again , swapping envelopes back and forward ad - infinitum .
And that is absurd .
That is the paradox .
A simple mathematical puzzle .
The question is :
What is wrong ?
Where does the fallacy lie , and what is the problem ?
My answer
There have been comments made by many people on this problem , most of which provide good solutions to the problem , but some of which are just plain wrong !
Those which are right generally amount to much the same idea .
My attempt at an answer can be found on the Two Envelope Paradox Solution page .
Web Trend Map 2008 : New Layers
Those familiar with the new Swiss train station maps may recognize one source of inspiration .
After meeting with our good friend Adrian Schaffner from evoq over the holidays , we studied his impressive work with mapping the Swiss train stations and adopted a few of the concepts ourselves .
Instead of cluttering the main stations with additional information , we elaborated on their trends by adding two new layers : brand quality and interface quality .
Brand Experience
We named the brand quality layer “ Brand Experience . ”
It illustrates our perception of user experience and brand management of the main stations .
We studied the usability , user value , and interface ( simplicity , character , and feedback ) , and rated each site on a scale of eating at various types of Japanese restaurants .
We chose restaurants as the metaphor for brand experience because , from an interactive branding point of view , a visit to a website is like a visit to a restaurant in terms of service , feedback , content , pleasure , character , and memorability .
And also because Tokyo has the highest density of good restaurants in the world — even the cocky French have to admit that now .
Kyoto - Style Tea Ceremony : The best grade .
The user experiences maximum care in every detail of their experience .
The New York Times is a well - designed and well - thought - out news site .
Google continues to set standards .
Bloomberg impressed us by sticking to its classic style , despite IDEO ’s offer of a very convincing redesign .
YouTube improves a step at a time with its tight and clever redesign cycles .
Wikipedia can be difficult to use , but the pleasure it provides ca n’t be beat .
Apple scores repeatedly with its innovative , user - centered interfaces .
You can hear the soft pluck of a koto in the background .
in the background .
Jazz Yakitori : very cool .
Japanese yakitori ( grilled chicken ) is as good as chicken comes .
There is one yakitori place in Shibuya we especially like .
They serve cold beer that is as delicious and soothing as the smooth jazz that fills the restaurant .
Most Google products qualify , but also iTunes ( of course ) , LastFM ( applause ) , Craigslist ( fantastic service and still a great interface ) , Newsvine ( has its flaws , but still a great product ) , MSN Messenger , and of course , Twitter due to its superb simplicity .

Ramen Shop :
As the quality of ramen shops varies greatly , so do the websites in this category .
But — in the words of Larry David — they are all still “ pretty pretty good . ”

But — in the words of Larry David — they are all still “ pretty pretty good . ”
Maku Donarudo ( McDonald’s ) : They serve you like a Japanese McDonald’s .
In other words , the food is okay , but you know exactly what to expect and they bow after you pay .
Food Poisoning : Do n’t go there .
There are so many good restaurants in Tokyo that you really have to be unlucky to find a bad one .
Websites on the main line that provide a bad brand experience are either stow aways , or managed to get where they are due to the power and money driving them .
If Microsoft Live starts whining , “ why do we get such bad grades ?
We do exactly what Google does , ” we ’d echo , “ exactly “ .
A strong brand has character and class ; Microsoft does not .
Neither does The Washington Post .
We ’ve said it before and even showed how to do it , and even cellulose designers know there ’s something wrong .
Momentum
In addition to excellent food , Tokyo also sports a wild party scene .
We rate the main sites in terms of interface quality .
A website ’s momentum is comparable to the momentum of a dancer in action — or exhaustion .
Some of us speculate occasionally , albeit without real cupidity , about what we would do if we suddenly found ourselves in possession of a billion pounds .
Even after funding a big house with lots of staff , car with chauffeur , yacht , helicopter and suchlike , there would be enough left to live on the interest , with a few hundred million to spare .
I suppose one could entrust the money to Polly Toynbee and George Monbiot to give to deserving causes , but not many billionaires are enlightened enough to do that .
Instead , there are today so many doggedly materialistic possessors of surplus wealth that a huge luxury goods industry exists to succour their plight .
In Paris recently , I heard of a restaurant frequented by Russian oligarchs , where woodcock features on the menu .
In France it is illegal to sell this delicious little bird .
The restaurant exploits its scarcity value by charging £ 220 , and finds plenty of takers .
Indeed , the place 's average bill for lunch for two is over £ 600 .
This is a boon for those with more cash than they know what to do with .
Yet how could any human being , however devoted to consuming illegal woodcock , want £ 20 bn ?
This was my first thought , on reading the Guardian 's report last week about the alleged secret fortune of Russia 's president , Vladimir Putin .
It is comprehensible that he should want to put away a little something , or even a big something , for his old age .
But even if he buys an Airbus as a personal jet and bathes in Krug , he can hardly hope to make much of a dent in £ 20bn .
The story is plausible , however , because evidence suggests that once a head of state finds himself free to write personal cheques on a national treasury , the privilege almost invariably goes to his head .
Some African leaders pocket billions , Robert Mugabe notable among them .
A World Bank report suggests that the sums stolen by the continent 's politicians since the end of the colonial era exceed those given to it in aid .
The international community is dismayed by the prospect that Jacob Zuma is likely to become South Africa 's next president - despite an aide 's conviction on corruption charges and the likelihood that Zuma himself will face a similar indictment , for accepting bribes from a French arms company .
Alas , however , Zuma 's elevation would merely indicate that South Africa is joining the global pack .
Transparency International 's admirable reports show that far more countries are corrupt than are not .
In South America , for instance , Chile is a beacon of integrity in a continent where corruption is endemic .
In many places , the cancer reaches from the base of the system - slipping banknotes into a driving licence to dissuade a policeman from issuing a speeding fine - to the summit : theft by ministers from national exchequers .
In Britain , we are rightly made uncomfortable by allegations of bribery against BAE , with supposed government collusion , to sell arms to Saudi Arabia .
Occasional police and local authority corruption cases make news .
But we still have grounds for self - congratulation , that our domestic institutions are honest .
Scandals involving British politicians involve relatively small sums of money , usually destined for party funds rather than personal enrichment .
The cash for honours affair is very small beer by global standards .
Of course , complacency would be foolish .
The threat of exposure by a free media and impartial judiciary is a far more potent incentive towards keeping our politicians clean than any inherent moral superiority prevailing at Westminster .
But it remains the case that nobody in this country gets rich out of governing .
Tony Blair will make millions from post - retirement speechmaking , but that represents a snub to popular sentiment , not a breach of ethics .
Russia 's condition , by contrast , is desperate .
Corruption prevails at every level , partly because government employees are so poorly paid .
On the Global Corruption Index , Russia stands close to bottom , between Rwanda and the Philippines .
If Putin is not transferring huge sums to a Swiss bank account , he is one of the few powerful men in his country to miss the chance .
We seem rashly acquiescent about the expatriate community in London .
Few of the Russians who throng Bond Street and patronise the Gavroche restaurant have made their pile by anything we would call honest toil .
Most are active participants in a gangster culture .
Their cheques may not bounce , but many are drawn on accounts stuffed with stolen money - no matter that such thefts may have been authorised by the Kremlin .
If we allow rich gangsters to locate here , their methods are likely , sooner or later , to infect our own society , in a fashion of which the Litvinenko murder provided a foretaste .
Paul Collier , in his important book on world poverty , The Bottom Billion , makes the point that corruption will flourish until there is an international agreement on banking transparency .
A few weeks ago , as I deposited a four - figure cheque at a West End bank branch , the teller asked me where I had got the money .
When I expressed astonishment , she said : " I 'm sorry , but we now have to ask that question about all large sums . "
This is part of a clumsy British attempt to check money laundering .
However , I doubt whether many Swiss banks ask such questions , or ever will , about a deposit of a billion or two by Putin , or indeed Zuma .
Corruption matters most to the peoples of the poorest countries .
Ordinary Russians are so grateful to see their standard of living rise on the back of oil and gas revenues that they are not minded to ask how much cash is being diverted by their leaders upriver .
But in Zimbabwe , the Democratic Republic of Congo and parts of central Asia , such behaviour causes people to starve .
In China , Nigeria 's Lagos state , Argentina , and a few other Latin American countries , some progress has been made in reducing judicial corruption by paying judges better and introducing independent monitoring .
Civil cases doubled in China 's courts in the decade up to 2005 , partly because of an improved perception of the chance of litigants securing justice .
Worldwide , however , rising competition from emerging markets for energy , commodities and contracts is making corruption worse , not better .
The Global Corruption Index highlights Italy among the worst European offenders for paying bribes in developing countries .
Elsewhere , Russia , China and India are the most notable promoters of commercial corruption , but few developed nations are guiltless .
Cynics shrug , as they do over the BAE allegations : " It 's the way of the world , and always will be . "
Yet the cost is dire for scores of nations .
Social and economic progress is overwhelmingly dependent on a rule of law .
In its absence , societies chronically underperform their potential .
It will be a tragedy for the people of South Africa if that country continues its descent - hastened by increasing curbs on media monitoring of government - towards levels of corruption prevailing elsewhere .
It does not seem too extravagant to say that Russia will never become a successful society unless it abandons its gangster ethos .
It is scarcely relevant whether Putin has helped himself to £ 20 m or £ 20 bn .
What matters is that those who wield power in Russia live beyond the law , a reality that benights any society which falls victim to it .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- China 's reluctance to put up the money to back another U.S. financial - services company does not bode well .
On its face , it looks as though China has lost confidence in Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % , U.S. financial services in general or the U.S. market as a whole .
Reports Monday said the government in Beijing had put the brakes on a plan by its investment arm , China Development Bank , to invest $ 2 billion .
Presidential campaign provides mantle for Senator 's move to hold corporate spies accountable Nick Juliano
Published : Friday November 2 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Democratic presidential candidate Chris Dodd may be polling below the margin of error , but his presidential bid has provided a podium for his moves in the Senate to curtail President Bush 's power grab .
Selling himself as a dark horse alternative to the frontrunners , Dodd has used his presence on the campaign trail to raise the visibility of his attempts to block administration proposals are restore what he says have been crumbling Constitutional rights in the last seven years .
The Connecticut Senator 's recent promise to filibuster a foreign surveillance law that would grant legal immunity to phone and internet companies that helped the NSA spy on Americans without warrants has helped raise his profile , especially among progressive bloggers and liberal activists .
" People online have been clamoring for [ candidates ] not just to say the right things , but to do the right things , " campaign spokesman Matt Browner Hamlin told RAW STORY .
Dodd announced he would put a " hold " on an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act if it contained telecom immunity when a bill was introduced Oct. 18 .
Within 36 hours , his campaign raised more than $ 200,000 .
" People are speaking with their wallets , and they want to support this campaign as it continues to move forward , " Browner Hamlin said .
Although the FISA debate is n't a deciding issue for enough voters to make a difference on its own , Dodd 's campaign is using the opportunity to remind voters of his calls to curtail Iraq war funding and restore habeas corpus .
Dodd is embracing the support he is receiving from his party 's left flank , in the Senate and on the campaign trail .
In a recent e-mail appeal sent to Democracy for America members , Dodd said he was more concerned about the FISA fight than his performance in their presidential straw poll .
" This might not be customary , but my ask is n't that you vote for me in the Pulse Poll , it is that you let Democracy for America HQ know how you feel about our fight to restore the Constitution and preserve the rule of law , " Dodd wrote .
" ... I 've been supported in this effort [ to block the FISA update ] by MoveOn , the ACLU , Glenn Greenwald , Atrios , the team at Firedoglake , Open Left , the Daily Kos community and countless other bloggers . "
The effort has been resonating on the Hill , too .
House aides tell RAW STORY that Dodd 's efforts have strengthened the resolve of Democrats in that chamber to keep telecom out of their bill .
Dodd recently told NBC's Meet the Press he feels " very good " about where the campaign is now , and he pointed out that eventual nominee John Kerry was lagging far behind in the polls this far out before the 2004 Iowa caucus .
Meanwhile , the five - term senator remains focused on the tasks before him , which include introducing legislation and continuing to stand up to the administration , Browner Hamlin says .
" A lot of what Sen .
Dodd has done throughout the campaign is continue to do his job . "

Angie Mecklenburg , a mother of four in Sutter , Ill. , blogs about chickens , God , and her farm .
For an estimated $ 15 , she 'll write about soy - wax candles for a marketer .
Over the last 18 months , Mecklenburg has kept up three blogs , the most popular being Ang 's Chicken Coop , which has the tagline " a view of the world from the coop . "
With about 250 daily visitors to her sites , she said she manages to make as much as $ 1,200 a month , collecting fees from Google advertising and marketers who pay her to write about their products via the blog ad network iZea .
For example , iZea recently paid her about $ 15 to write about candles from the Maddison Avenue Candles Company .
She also was paid to write a blog about the Christian movie The Last Sin Eater earlier this year .
" iZea sent me a synopsis and movie clip .
I blogged it and then I went and saw it , " Mecklenburg said at the BlogWorld conference and expo here , a three - day event for blog entrepreneurs and professionals .
She said she loved the movie .
Mecklenburg 's story is just one of many here this week at the Las Vegas Convention Center , which is also playing host to GodblogCon , a gathering of religious bloggers .
Many of the attendees are trying to figure out how to make money from their small publishing ventures , whether it 's a political , military , or God-related blog .
iZea , formerly called Pay for Post , is one company trying to capitalize on that desire .
Founded in June 2006 , the company pays as many as 85,000 bloggers to write about a range of products , including household products , cars , wireless phones , and new movies .
According to Randy Mountz , vice president of sales , iZea has roughly 11,000 advertisers in its network , including Hewlett - Packard , Ford , and MGM .
Mountz said the company pays bloggers an average of $ 18 for a 200 - word post on a product or service .
Its top blogger , the Florida mom behind Simplekindoflife.com , has made as much as $ 18,000 over the last year , he said .
Still , the company has had some push - back from other bloggers for buying blog editorial , he said .
That 's why , " we strongly encourage full disclosure in the post of the sponsorship , " he said .
And so far , that 's working for Mecklenburg , who now has as many as six blogs to discuss her different interests .
Those sites include Twitter - patted.com and Ang 's Brood .
" I blog about God and the things I see he does in my life , " she said .
" But it 's not my sole focus .
I have many interests and it 's really hard to wrap all of them in one blog . "

On today 's Countdown , Keith Olbermann aired a somber and enraging segment on the sad state of affairs for our veterans on this Veteran 's Day .
Talking with Paul Rieckhoff from IAVA , Olbermann blasted George Bush for ducking out of the ceremonies at Arlington Cemetary , talked about the growing number of homeless Iraq & Afghanistan vets and the utterly disgraceful silencing of anti-Iraq veterans in Massachusetts and Southern California who were not allowed to participate in Veterans Day parades -- some were even arrested .
On the one day of the year their voices should have been heard and they should have been honored , they were instead betrayed by their fellow citizens .
I do n't have the words to describe that kind of cruelty .
Keith also touches on the gut wrenching story of Lance Corporal James Blake Miller -- better known as the Marlboro Marine -- who is now jobless , divorced and near suicidal since being discharged from the military after being diagnosed with PTSD .
With little aid from his government , Miller received help from an unlikely source -- Luis Sinco , the LA Times photographer who snapped the famous picture of him during the battle of Fallujah in 2004 .
You can read Sinco 's story in the LAT here .
People are beginning to talk about recession , but no one 's talking about depression , except a few ; news sources and " responsible " commentators consider them un-mannerly , or mad .
That does n't mean they 're wrong , only that what they 're saying is not something people want to hear .
Consider the immensity of the sub - prime mess .
It began as a scheme by banks to expand the mortgage market ; traditional mortgages were n't growing fast enough , nor producing the profits they wanted .
So , banks began lending to people with lower incomes and more unstable livelihoods .
Since their credit rankings were terrible , these people ( a large portion were minorities ) were charged more than someone with more money .
Many minority borrowers merited conventional mortgages , but were steered towards the more expensive sub - primes , as well .
In order to sell these , banks found all sorts of creative ways to conceal what the borrower would really pay until after the bank had sold the " asset " ( the mortgage ) to the first of many buyers in an increasingly complicated resale market .
The resale market drew in investors from LA to Scotland to Singapore to Tokyo .
Why could this be a depression , or more than a recession ?
The world economy until now was in a period of huge growth , but most of the proceeds went to a small elite .
The US middle class financed the growth through high personal indebtedness .
In addition , in the US , growth has been bought by continuous deficit spending for wars , and Republican unwillingness to pay for them .
How much more " economic stimulus " will the economy need above the chronic budget deficits of almost $ 300 billion a year ?
The global market is huge now .
In the 1930 's the US was comparatively self - sufficient , not only in oil , but in manufactured goods and food ; it exported goods and food .
Now , the US accumulates debt for two of the three .
Even most made - in - America products have large amounts of foreign components .
Even services are imported .
US debt overtops debts held by almost all other nations combined .
When the Fed lowers interest rates , it not only reduces the costs of mortgages and other loans , thereby stimulating the domestic economy , it also raises the costs of imports since interest rate cuts make the dollar less attractive abroad ( dollar funds will pay less ) .
In theory , a cheaper dollar should mean the US can export more and import less , but not if a large proportion of imports are fixed into the structure of doing business : importing raw materials , parts , outsourcing and offshoring , that 's how transnational corporations work .
It will take them years to shift their supply chains , so , in the meantime , US debt abroad will grow even larger , and higher prices for foreign goods will cause it to grow faster .
The subprime crisis is only a trigger ; the growing world economy has become more unstable because of the unequal distribution of proceeds : if people are n't paid well , the US mass market becomes unaffordable ; people can't go deeper into debt ad infinitum , especially when their houses lose value -- they can no longer borrow against them .
Our economy depends upon the unsustainable : massive imports , for which we pay ( on net ) with further debt .
Some of that debt -- the funds based on the subprime mortgages -- may never be repaid .
How eager will foreigners be to lend more money to the US ?
It all comes of allowing banks to trade in financial markets without restrictions : banks are not conservative when it comes to earning more money in the short term ; they will use any leverage they have , including the cash they can generate from selling lousy mortgages , and any new paper money they can create through inventive financial manipulation .
Hence the " bubbles : " dot.com , stocks and now housing .
Banks are not able to regulate themselves .
The US needs to remember the lessons it learned in the Great Depression : banking and business , generally , must be re-regulated , investors must be restrained , people have to be paid generous wages , taxes must be raised on the " have - mores " and lowered on those who have less : inequality must be reduced .
The global impact of the bursting US housing bubble demonstrates what I have written about in The Selfish Class ( available at http:www.roman-empire-america-now.com/e-books.html ) .
When the wealthy are in control , the whole society suffers : the late Roman Empire was a particularly egregious example : it fell because the selfish class , the Senators , cornered all the wealth , and ultimately refused to use it even when the survival of their empire was at stake .
The basis for a stable economy is a more equitable distribution of its wealth .
Then the American mass market can be re-energized ; it appears to be the engine behind global growth .
Tax rebates , extended unemployment benefits and social security bonuses are only temporary stopgaps .
Tax cuts to businesses , and making the Bush tax cuts permanent would only increase inequality ; it would not re-establish the American mass market .
Economically , US policy has to go in the opposite direction .

First many people spoke to President Clinton and even asked him questions .
Even I asked President Clinton a question .
And President Clinton , the Secret Service , the police , and security did not try to have me or anyone else arrested for asking a question .
Second , nobody from the Secret Service nor the police tried to have someone arrested because of a question they thought the person was going to ask .
I could n't believe it , there was no one at the store that Insanitized or wearing a Mark Levin Stalker Club T Shirt .
Third , the people attending the book signing event were all nice people .
Nobody was advocating killing all the Mexicans , bombing the entire Middle East , calling people " faggots " or telling people that they wish their parents never had their children .
Instead , the people attending the book signing event made open to the public were thoughtful , kind , ordinary individuals who simply go out there everyday living their lives , raising families , and working hard .
These wonderful people came from all walks of life and a wide variety of vocations .
Fourth , there were even a few people at the event who disagreed with Bill Clinton politically .
And all these people with their Ron Paul signs were able to display their signs about 50 feet away from where President Clinton was .
There were no Sgt Tim's of unAmericanfamiliesagainst911 families on the line saying , " Pop there goes the Ron Paul windbag supporter outside " or Petes from Babylon , Long Island advocating coldcocking Ron Paul supporters for their political views .
All the nice people on the line there to see Bill Clinton seemed to share some common values that people of differing views are allowed to dissent , that we do n't terrorize the homes , workplaces , or telephone lines of these dissenters , and that implied or overt threats against people of differing political views is unAmerican .
Fifth , Bill Clinton did n't decide to cancel the book event just because I had announced that I would be attending days in advance .
I 'm truly not that omnipotent .
Now Bill Clinton ( who by the way is a VERY impressive , radiant man who emanates likability once you get within 100 feet of him ) requires a zillion times more security than some Detestable or Insanitized Right Wing WABC radio talk show hosts who consistently advocates or have friendly guests consistently advocate , murdering , jailing , or torturing hundreds of millions of people because they do n't like their politics , religion , ethnicity , race , or sexual orientation .
Now if Dave the law abiding , civil , cooperative , citizen with no criminal record was not deemed a security risk for a former President of the United States , then what are people like Sean Insanitized Hannity and Mark The Worst One Levin afraid of ?
Oh I forgot , they recognize that right wing conservatism is a fringe philosophy and if they had to debate or discuss politics in a fair forum with someone who is n't a paid patsy like Alan Colmes or in an open media event where mikes can't be cut and video and audio clips disingenously edited , then morons like Hannity and Levin would get crushed , their ideology exposed , and 76 - 80 % of Americans would rally behind other alternatives .
Oh and yes , my offer to debate Hannity from previous diaries ( and the terms therein ) in exchange for me agreeing not to sue him for his role in trying to have me falsely arrested still stands .
But Hannity is a chicken and a coward .
Til next time .
Nicolas Chorier is a Frenchman who specialises in " kite photography " .
This image of the Jama Masjid in Delhi appears in a new book , Kite 's Eye View : India Between Earth and Sky , published by Roli Books .
Well , now we know .
Scientists have documented that the Bush / Cheney administration has been a greater threat to Americans ’ health and safety than Osama Bin Laden and his terror band .
Specifically , The New York Times , in its science section today , reports that a new study published in the Archives of General Psychiatry has found that while the risk to Americans of dying at the hands of a terrorist was roughly equal to the chance of “ drowning in a toilet , ” the risk of cardiovascular disease among people who are frightened about the threat of terrorism is 300 - 500 % higher than for people who are not worried .
What this means is that the Bush / Cheney administration , by constantly hyping the nation ’s fears of terror through the use of everything from daily color - coded terror alerts , to absurd inspection procedures at airline terminals and parcel post restrictions , is actually scaring some of us to death .
And for what ?
From the moment those planes hit the World Trade Center and the Pentagon back in September 2001 , Bush , Cheney and their allies — Republican and Democrat — in Congress and the media have been peppering us with warnings that the “ bad guys ” are out to kill us , to destroy our way of life , and to defeat America .
It has been a ludicrous idea from the start .
The idea that small gang of guys from the Middle East could bring the mightiest nation that the world has ever known to its knees , or even significantly threaten the safety and security of the people of the United States is simply absurd and laughable .
Why , even the detonation of a small smuggled nuclear device in or near an American city , should such a thing ever come to pass , would be less of a threat to the nation as a whole than the eruption of one of our many active volcanoes — say Mt. Rainier or Mt. Hood , or the Yellowstone caldera — or an 8 or 9 - point earthquake in San Francisco or Los Angeles .
And those natural disasters are probably more likely than the explosion of a terrorist nuke .
I have been stunned at the response of my fellow Americans to this blatant nonsense .
Shortly after the Twin Towers went down , my local school district announced the cancellation for the entire year of all school trips !
There was a fear among parents and members of the local school authorities that the buses carrying them to museums or the zoo might pose tempting targets for terrorists !
Our kids were also treated to scary “ intruder lockdowns ” where they ’d be locked with their teachers in their classrooms while local cops dressed in black SWAT gear and armed with assault rifles played army in the hallways looking for imaginary terrorists .
I ’ve gone on plane flights where I ’ve had to wait in line for an hour while Transportation Security Administration guards check the tiny shoes of six - month - old infants to make sure they were n’t shoe bombs , and have had to surrender countless bottles of mouthwash and drinking water and tubes of toothpaste , all suspected of being smuggled explosives .
( I was also honored with an “ S ” mark on my boarding pass a couple of times , which meant I was pulled aside for special inspection for fear I might be a terrorist myself . )
All of this nonsense , however , is coming with a price .
I can laugh because I know it ’s nonsense .
But some people are n’t laughing .
They ’re living in fear .
And that fear is causing them to suffer cardiovascular disease , according to this new study .
Of course , that ’s only the tip of the iceberg , really , when it comes to the cost of the Washington terror scam .
American businesses have spent literally tens of billions of dollars — maybe hundreds of billions of dollars — on security measures , fearing terror attacks on their installations , or on their communications , or on Wall Street .
Thousands of foreign science students and scientists have been banned from the US — or even deported -- for fear they might be terrorists in training .
Municipalities and states have spent billions in taxpayer dollars on security that they simply do n’t need .
My little town of Upper Dublin , just north of Philadelphia , with just some 26,000 people , has its own police SWAT team , for Pete ’s sake , complete with a large gray SWAT vehicle — a panel truck loaded with heavy combat firepower capable of repelling a small third - world army .
I wonder how many teachers that money could have hired ?
Maybe they would n’t have had to let the elementary music program go down the tubes .
I have n't mentioned the whole $ 1 - 2 trillion War in Iraq , which was all the result of presidential and vice presidential scare mongering .
And of course , that ’s just the financial cost of scare mongering .
We ’ve also given up most of our Bill or Rights , and even some more ancient rights , like the right of Habeas Corpus .
And we ’re about to give up our entire right to privacy if the government gets its way and introduces a national identity card .
How far away are we from having to get injected with identity chips ?
All this panic and fear , and yet we still sing this national anthem that calls America “ the home of the brave ” ?

Overclocking The NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB
The NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB is built upon the new G92 GPU , a refresh of the ground - breaking NVIDIA G80 GPU which not only powered the older GeForce 8800 GTS 640MB and 320 MB cards , but also the GeForce 8800 GTX .
Like those graphics cards , the new NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB features a massively - parallel unified architecture , as well as support for DirectX 10 .
The new G92 GPU , however , features a new VP2 video processor and support for PCI Express 2.0 .
It is also fabricated on a smaller , cooler 65 nm process technology .
For more details on the actual architecture of the new G92 GPU , do take a look at our NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT Tech Report .
When we first reviewed the GeForce 8800 GT , we were most impressed with its performance .
For a mid-range enthusiast - grade graphics card , it offered a tremendous boost in performance over its predecessors .
In fact , it was actually faster than the higher - end and much more expensive GeForce 8800 GTX !
Best of all , it was as reasonably - priced as the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT and much more easily available .
That made it an extremely compelling card for gamers , especially those who can afford the extra cost .
Recently , we showed you just how fast an overclocked GeForce 8800 GT was , compared to the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB which was 20 % more expensive .
Today , we will see if the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB has any overclocking potential .
Even if it is only as overclockable as the GeForce 8800 GT , the presence of 16 ( 14.3 % ) extra stream processors would mean that the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB will scale faster in performance for the same increase in clock speed .
However , we did not want this to be an example of extreme overclocking , where you would need to resort to third - party coolers .
With that method , you can achieve an incredible degree of overclocking but it would come at a significant cost .
We wanted this attempt to come at " no cost " to the user .
That meant overclocking the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB using its standard cooler .
Let 's take a look at the cooler .
The GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB Cooler
The GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB uses a large cast aluminium heatsink with a copper insert , similar to the one used in the GeForce 8800 GTX .
This allows for a better thermal transfer to the heatsink and yet keeps the cost and weight low .
With the shroud in place , the air is directed through the aluminium fins and out the vents on the card bracket .
The cooler is powered by a single Delta BFB1012L blower fan placed to the right side of the cooler .
This is the same blower fan used in the GeForce 8800 Ultra .
According to Delta , the BFB1012L is a 12V fan with ball bearings and a current draw of 0.32A and a power output of 3.84W .
At these specifications , it spins at at slow 2700 RPM but moves a remarkable 19.07 CFM or 0.54 CMM with a noise level of 45 dBA .
However , as you can see , the fan installed in this card actually draws 0.48A .
This gives it a much higher power output of 5.76W .
Although we cannot just extrapolate its performance from the increase in power output , it stands to reason that this cooler will perform much better than Delta 's specifications .
It is certainly more powerful than the GeForce 8800 GT 's fan .
The message posted Friday evening on emacs - devel by Richard Stallman was cryptic : " Stefan and Yidong offered to take over , so I am willing to hand over Emacs development to them . "
Just like that : 32 years after bringing the GNU Emacs text editor into the developer world , Stallman is relinquishing his role as its maintainer .
On Saturday morning , I e-mailed him a few questions about his decision and the future of Emacs , which he graciously agreed to answer after first eliciting from me this Stallmanesque pledge :
I 'll answer your questions if you promise me that the story will avoid a couple of frequent errors .
One common error is referring to a free operating system as " Linux . "
That system is basically GNU ; Linux is actually the kernel , one program in the system .
Calling the whole system " Linux " means giving the system 's principal developer none of the credit .
See ( this link ) for more explanation .
Would you please agree to distinguish consistently in your article between Linux , the kernel , and GNU / Linux , the entire system ?
Since GNU
Emacs is part of GNU , this is directly relevant .
The other common error is labeling me , GNU , GNU / Linux , or the GNU GPL with the term " Open Source . "
That is the slogan adopted in 1998 by people who reject the philosophy of the Free Software Movement .
They have the right to promote their views , but we would like to be associated with our views , not theirs .
For more explanation , see ( this link ) .
My response to your questions , based on the ideals of the Free Software Movement , would be very different from what a supporter of Open Source would say .
Could you please agree to refer to this work as Free Software in your article , and not as Open Source ?
In particular , please do n't describe GNU Emacs as " Open Source . "
In this case , I had only a few questions and they all pertained to Richard Stallman and GNU Emacs , so I 'd agree to call the work synchronized swimming in the interest of getting answers .
Sunday dinnertime , having been assured of my intended compliance , he answers :
Why now ?
I find I am too busy with other work to give Emacs maintenance the attention it deserves .
I 've been considering handing the maintainership over to others for most of a year .
Are you doing this reluctantly ?
Or eagerly ?
I feel nostalgia , but not very strongly .
Pardon my unfamiliarity with them , but who are Stefan and Yidong ?
Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong are two of the main Emacs developers of recent years .
What do you see as the future of Emacs ?
I would like to see it extended to operate as a word processor , editing formatted text .
32 years is a long time to devote to anything .
Any parting thoughts ?
I have not spent 32 years working on Emacs , and I 'm not quite " parting . "
Since I first wrote GNU Emacs in 1984 , I have not been the maintainer all the time .
In fact , three other people have been the maintainer of GNU Emacs at various times .
Gerd Moellman was the Maintainer for about 4 years , until a while after the release of Emacs 21 .
During that time he implemented display of variable - width text .
He decided to stop , so I took up the maintainership again .
I 'm pretty sure I 've held up my end of the bargain .
The day I meet Sonja Lyubomirsky , she keeps getting calls from her Toyota Prius dealer .
When she finally picks up , she is excited by the news : she can buy the car she wants in two days .
Lyubomirsky wonders if her enthusiasm might come across as materialism , but I understand that she is buying an experience as much as a possession .
The hybrid will be gentler on the environment , and a California state law letting some hybrids use the carpool lane promises a faster commute between her coastal Santa Monica home and her job at the University of California , Riverside , some 70 miles inland .
Two weeks later , in late January , the 40 - year - old Lyubomirsky , who smiles often and seems to approach life with zest and good humor , reports that she is " totally loving the Prius . "
But will the feeling wear off soon after the new - car smell , or will it last , making a naturally happy person even more so ?
An experimental psychologist investigating the possibility of lasting happiness , Lyubomirsky understands far better than most of us the folly of pinning our hopes on a new car -- or on any good fortune that comes our way .
We tend to adapt , quickly returning to our usual level of happiness .
The classic example of such " hedonic adaptation " comes from a 1970s study of lottery winners , who a year after their windfall ended up no happier than nonwinners .
Hedonic adaptation helps to explain why even changes in major life circumstances -- such as income , marriage , physical health and where we live -- do so little to boost our overall happiness .
Not only that , but studies of twins and adoptees have shown that about 50 percent of each person 's happiness is determined from birth .
This " genetic set point " alone makes the happiness glass look half empty , because any upward swing in happiness seems doomed to fall back to near your baseline .
" There 's been a tension in the field , " explains Lyubo ? mirsky 's main collaborator , psychologist Kennon M. Sheldon of the University of Missouri - Columbia .
" Some people were assuming you can affect happiness if , for example , you picked the right goals , but there was all this literature that suggested it was impossible , that what goes up must come down . "
Lyubomirsky , Sheldon and another psychologist , David A. Schkade of the University of California , San Diego , put the existing findings together into a simple pie chart showing what determines happiness .
Half the pie is the genetic set point .
The smallest slice is circumstances , which explain only about 10 percent of people 's differences in happiness .
So what is the remaining 40 percent ?
" Because nobody had put it together before , that 's unexplained , " Lyubomirsky says .
But she believes that when you take away genes and circumstances , what is left besides error must be " intentional activity , " mental and behavioral strategies to counteract adaptation 's downward pull .
Lyubomirsky has been studying these activities in hopes of finding out whether and how people can stay above their set point .
In theory , that is possible in much the same way regular diet and exercise can keep athletes ' weight below their genetic set points .
But before Lyubomirsky began , there was " a huge vacuum of research on how to increase happiness , " she says .
The lottery study in particular " made people shy away from interventions , " explains eminent University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin E. P. Seligman , the father of positive psychology and a mentor to Lyubomirsky .
When science had scrutinized happiness at all , it was mainly through correlational studies , which cannot tell what came first -- the happiness or what it is linked to -- let alone determine the cause and effect .
Finding out that individuals with strong social ties are more satisfied with their lives than loners , for example , begs the question of whether friends make us happier or whether happy people are simply likelier to seek and attract friends .
Lyubomirsky began studying happiness as a graduate student in 1989 after an intriguing conversation with her adviser , Stanford University psychologist Lee D. Ross , who told her about a remarkably happy friend who had lost both parents to the Holocaust .
Ross explains it this way : " For this person , the meaning of the Holocaust was that it was indecent or inappropriate to be unhappy about trivial things -- and that one should strive to find joy in life and human relationships . "
Psychologists have long known that different people can see and think about the same events in different ways , but they had done little research on how these interpretations affect well - being .
Count your blessings every day ?
Not if you want to be really happy .
So Lyubomirsky had to lay some groundwork before she could go into the lab .
Back then , happiness was " a fuzzy , unscientific topic , " she says , and although no instrument yet exists for giving perfectly valid , reliable and precise readings of someone 's happiness from session to session , Lyubomirsky has brought scientific rigor to the emerging field .
From her firm belief that it is each person 's self - reported happiness that matters , she developed a four - question Subjective Happiness Scale .
Lyubomirsky 's working definition of happiness --" a joyful , contented life " -- gets at both the feelings and judgments necessary for overall happiness .
( If a sleep - deprived new mom feels fulfilled but frazzled , and an aimless party girl feels empty despite loads of fun , neither would consider herself truly happy . )
To this day , she rarely sees her studies ' participants ; they do most exercises out in the real world and answer detailed questionnaires on the computer , often from home .
To assess subjects ' efforts and honesty , she uses several cross-checks , such as timing them as they complete the questionnaires .
The research needed to answer questions about lasting happiness is costly , because studies need to follow a sizable group of people over a long time .
Two and a half years ago Lyubomirsky and Sheldon received a five - year , $ 1 - million grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to do just that .
Investigators have no shortage of possible strategies to test , with happiness advice coming " from the Buddha to Tony Robbins , " as Seligman puts it .
So Lyubomirsky started with three promising strategies : kindness , gratitude and optimism -- all of which past research had linked with happiness .
Her aim is not merely to confirm the strategies ' effectiveness but to gain insights into how happiness works .
For example , conventional wisdom suggests keeping a daily gratitude journal .
But one study revealed that those who had been assigned to do that ended up less happy than those who had to count their blessings only once a week .
Lyubomirsky therefore confirmed her hunch that timing is important .
So is variety , it turned out : a kindness intervention found that participants told to vary their good deeds ended up happier than those forced into a kindness rut .
Lyubomirsky is also asking about mediators :
Why , for example , does acting kind make you happier ?
" I 'm a basic researcher , not an applied researcher , so I 'm interested not so much in the strategies but in how they work and what goes on behind the scenes , " she explains .
Initial results with the interventions have been promising , but sustaining them is tough .
Months after a study is over , the people who have stopped the exercises show a drop in happiness .
Like a drug or a diet , the exercises work only if you stick with them .
Instilling habits is crucial .
Another key : " fit , " or how well the exercise matches the person .
If sitting down to imagine your best possible self ( an optimism exercise ) feels contrived , you will be less likely to do it .
The biggest factor may be getting over the idea that happiness is fixed -- and realizing that sustained effort can boost it .
" A lot of people do n't apply the notion of effort to their emotional lives , " Lyubomirsky declares , " but the effort it takes is enormous . "
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 21 , 2007
The villages around Nablus have recently seen a rise in demonstrations against roadblocks .
In Sarra , and now in Qusin , people are standing up to the bars and cages the Israeli army has erected around the villages .
It has not been easy : people have been arrested , gassed , and shot .
Despite this , the villagers of Qusin refuse to give in to this assault on non-violent protest .
Villagers from Qusin along with Israeli and international activists will meet at the village mosque , in Qusin , before 12 noon .
They will leave after the noon prayer and demonstrate at the site of the roadblock .
Also , following a recent victory in their own battle in the Israeli High Court , the Popular Committe Against the Wall in Bil’in and other Palestinian activists from that village will join the Qusin struggle this week .
The roadblock in Qusin turns a simple five minute trip to Nablus into nearly an hour ’s journey .
This situation is mirrored in the villages around .
Following demonstrations in the nearby village of Sarra the military has invaded , shooting at water tanks and shop fronts , entering houses and harassing the people inside , including stealing their possessions .
The Israeli army has also responded to the non-violent demonstrations with extreme levels of violence and repression .
Last Saturday , the 15th of September , five Israelis , six internationals , and two Palestinians were taken prisoner after a non-violent demonstration against the roadblock in the village .
Five Palestinians and two internationals were injured from the soldier ’s brutality .
One of the internationals had the end of her finger shattered from a rubber bullet .
For more information on the Sept. 15 demo. , including video see here :

California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley ended five months of speculation and announced Friday that he was decertifying all electronic touch - screen voting machines in the state due to security concerns and lack of voter confidence .
He also said that he was passing along evidence to the state 's attorney general to bring criminal and civil charges against voting - machine - maker Diebold Election Systems for fraud .
" We will not tolerate deceitful tactics as engaged in by Diebold and we must send a clear and compelling message to the rest of the industry :
Do n't try to pull a fast one on the voters of California because there will be consequences if you do , " he said .
Shelley said the ban on touch - screen machines would stay in effect unless and until specific security measures could be put in place to safeguard the November vote .
" Revelations regarding touch - screen machines have shaken public confidence in this voting technology , " Shelley said , referring to four computer - science reports released in the last year that showed the machines to be badly designed and vulnerable to hacking .
" It is my foremost responsibility to take all steps necessary to make sure every vote cast in California will be accurately counted . "
At least four counties will not be able to use touch - screen machines at all in November because they purchased a type of Diebold machine that was never federally certified .
But Shelley held out hope for 10 counties that currently own other types of touch - screen machines by saying the state would consider recertifying the machines on a county - by - county basis for November if the counties could meet a long list of stringent security requirements .
County officials also must adhere to a number of directives for Election Day .
If they do n't meet the requirements , then they will have to use a paper - based voting method , such as optical - scan machines , which use a paper ballot that officials then scan into an electronic reader .
Additionally , Shelley declared that no county or vendor would be able to make last - minute changes to voting systems .
Such changes caused problems in at least two counties in the March primary where a malfunctioning Diebold device prevented hundreds of polling places from opening on time .
" That horrific process stops now .
We saw what it resulted in on March 2nd , " Shelley said .
Finally , all counties will have to provide voters with the option of voting on a provisional paper ballot if they feel uncomfortable casting votes on the paperless e-voting machines .
Shelley said that voting companies would bear the brunt of the estimated $ 1 million cost for providing extra provisional ballots to every county , indicating that the vendors caused the erosion in voter confidence , so they would have to pay for the solution .
" I do n't want a voter to not vote on Election Day because the only option before them is a touch - screen voting machine .
I want that voter to have the confidence that he or she can vote on paper and have the confidence that their vote was cast as marked , " Shelley said .
The state would bear the cost of some of the other changes , such as helping to replace touch - screen machines with optical - scan machines in counties that can't meet the stringent security requirements before November .
Counties will not be able to purchase any new e-voting machines unless the machines can produce a voter - verified paper trail that voters can use to authenticate that their vote was recorded accurately .
This pushes up a previous deadline Shelley put forth in December when he mandated that all new voting machines purchased after June 2005 would have to produce a paper trail .
" There will be a paper trail for every single vote cast in the state of California and it will happen on my watch as secretary of state , " he said .
To that end , Shelley announced that the state would have in place by May 30 a standard for a voter - verified paper trail on voting systems .
He said the Federal Election Commission assured him that it would move immediately to create its own standards and testing procedures for such a function so that new voting systems that offer an audit trail could be put in place .
There is currently only one vendor that manufactures such a machine that is fully certified .
The Vote - Trakker by Avante International Technology is certified by federal and state authorities .
A second company , AccuPoll , just received federal certification for its system and is working on state certification .
But federal certification authorities have never stipulated what standard such a function should follow .
Speaking assuredly and forcefully , Shelley said that in taking these actions he was accepting and expanding upon recommendations made by his Voting Systems and Procedures Panel earlier this week and last week .
The panel recommended that only one type of Diebold machine be decertified and that counties be required to take steps to secure remaining machines .
In decertifying all of the machines and making counties prove that they can secure them before recertifying them , Shelley hoped to avoid conditions like those that arose in the March primary when several counties simply ignored directives that came from his office .
The decision means that Kern , San Joaquin , San Diego and Solano counties will not be able to use the 15,000 or so AccuVote - TSx voting machines they purchased from Diebold .
They will likely use optical - scan machines made by Diebold .
In addressing the issue of Diebold 's activity , Shelley described how the state had given the TSx system conditional certification in December only because Diebold had assured the state repeatedly that federal certification was imminent .
But Shelley said the company lied and switched systems on the state .
While counties had in their possession one version of the TSx that the company said was getting federally certified , the company had actually submitted a different , newer version of the TSx to federal authorities to certify .
The system the four counties possess still is not federally certified .
" That was despicable and that was misleading , " Shelley said .
Furthermore , the company had installed uncertified software on other Diebold machines in the state , violating California election law .
" Their conduct was absolutely reprehensible .
Their conduct should never be tolerated ever again by anyone in California , " Shelley said .

Illinois Sen. Barack Obama Thursday praised a judicial decision upholding Nevada caucus locations on the Las Vegas strip to aide casino workers - and strongly dismissed the angry accusations of former President Clinton who claimed the system was " rigged , " saying that was " an implausible argument " rightly rejected by the courts .
" This caucus process was designed by Democratic party of Nevada in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee , " said Obama , asked his reaction to the ruling in a meeting of the Chronicle editorial board Thursday .
" I , as somebody who 's not part of the establishment of the Democratic Party , had no say in the rules ....( but ) individuals like Harold Ickes , Clinton 's key adviser , were a part of making these rules .
And some o f the people who filed the lawsuit were a part of making these rules . "
" President Clinton now suggests they did n't understand the rules that they designed , " said Obama .
" This is coming from the campaign of extraordinary detail and thoroughness and experience , " said the Illinois Senator , laughing , in reference to a theme which has been strongly emphasized by the campaign of Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton since the two met Tuesday for a Nevada televised debate .
" But somehow , they did n't know what these rules were , " Obama said .
" Six days before the caucus - two days before I received the endorsement of the Culinary Workers ( Union ) , suddenly these rules are grossly unfair and a violation of ' one person , one vote ' .
And a lawsuit is filed that would disenfranchise mostly Latino maids , dishwashers , and bellhops from participating in the caucuses . "
Obama 's tough response to the former president came in reaction to a court ruling Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge James Mahan which rejected arguments of the teachers union , a group with ties to Sen .
Clinton , which had argued that the special caucus sites for casino workers were discriminatory and unfair to other Nevada voters .
The Nevada caucuses will be held Jan. 19 - and ruling was widely seen as a victory for Obama , who has been endorsed by the 60,000 member Culinary Workers Union , which represents the lion 's share of the workers who will use those locations .
The Chronicle reported Wednesday how President Clinton , following a roundtable discussion on the economy in Oakland , angrily debated with a television reporter who asked about the fairness of the lawsuit .
" Do you really believe that all the Democrats understood that they had agreed to give people who worked in the casino a vote worth five times as much as people who voted in their own precinct ? " the former President told ABC 7's Mark Matthews .
" Did you know that ?
Their votes will be counted five times more powerfully , in terms of delegates to the state convention , compared to delegates to the national convention , " Clinton said .
'" None of them knew that the votes were rigged that way .
They found that out later . "
He argued that " the state Democratic party is in the position of defending a system that makes it easier for some people to vote , and counts those votes five times as much ... no one could have known that at the time . "
Obama said that was " an implausible argument before the court rules .
I am glad the court bought none of it .
I think it took about an hour for the court to decide that this lawsuit had no merit . "
" And I think at this point we should go out and persuade the caucus goers of Nevada who the best candidate is , " he said .
Obama was in San Francisco and Silicon Valley Thursday as part of a campaign swing that included a roundtable discussion on the economy in the Mission District , and a fundraiser at the Westin St. Francis Hotel .
University of Queensland research has found the “ missing link ” in the evolution of the eye .
Professor Shaun Collin , from UQ's School of Biomedical Sciences , together with colleagues from the Australian National University and the University of Pennsylvania , have identified animals that have eyes that bridge the evolutionary link between those designed to simply differentiate light from dark to those that possess a camera - like eye .
Professor Collin said his research gathered evidence from multiple branches of biology , in support of a gradual evolution of the eye , and it proposes an explicit scenario to explain how it was that our eye emerged .
“ Charles Darwin was n't able to reconcile the evolution of the eye given its complexities and diversity of eye designs , ” Professor Collin said .
“ So it was a major surprise for us that we have found what appears to be a clear progression from a simple eye to a complex eye , which occurred over a relatively short period ( 30 million years ) in evolutionary history . ”
Professor Collin said the researchers studied a very primitive fish , the hagfish , to discover the missing link .
“ This animal diverged from our own line somewhere around 530 million years ago , ” he said .
“ Hagfish are simple , eel - shaped jawless and ugly animals , that inhabit the oceans at great depth , and that are renowned for the revolting ‘ slime ' they exude when disturbed .
“ They behave as if blind , though they have a primitive eye - like structure beneath an opaque eye - patch on either side of the head .
Previously it had widely been thought that the hagfish eye had degenerated from a lamprey - like precursor .
“ But our research suggests hagfish did not degenerate from lamprey - like ancestors , but are instead the remnants of an earlier sister group . ”
Professor Collin 's research with Professor Trevor Lamb from the Australian National University and Professor Ed Pugh from the University of Pennsylvania , was recently published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience .

The Milky Way is twice the size we thought it was
We were tossing around ideas about the size of the Galaxy , and thought we had better check the standard numbers that everyone uses , " Professor Gaensler said .
Image credit : NASA , ESA , and The Hubble Heritage Team ( STScI / AURA )
It took just a couple of hours using data available on the internet for University of Sydney scientists to discover that the Milky Way is twice as wide as previously thought .
Astrophysicist Professor Bryan Gaensler led a team that has found that our galaxy - a flattened spiral about 100,000 light years across - is 12,000 light years thick , not the 6,000 light years that had been previously thought .
Proving not all science requires big , expensive apparatus , Professor Gaensler and colleagues , Dr Greg Madsen , Dr Shami Chatterjee and PhD student Ann Mao , downloaded data from the internet and analysed it in a spreadsheet .
" We were tossing around ideas about the size of the Galaxy , and thought we had better check the standard numbers that everyone uses .
It took us just a few hours to calculate this for ourselves .
We thought we had to be wrong , so we checked and rechecked and could n't find any mistakes . "
The University of Sydney team 's analysis differs from previous calculations because they were more discerning with their data selection .
" We used data from pulsars : stars that flash with a regular pulse , " Professor Gaensler explains .
" As light from these pulsars travels to us , it interacts with electrons scattered between the stars ( the Warm Ionised Medium , or WIM ) , which slows the light down .
" In particular , the longer ( redder ) wavelengths of the pulse slow down more than the shorter ( bluer ) wavelengths , so by seeing how far the red lags behind the blue we can calculate how much WIM the pulse has travelled through .
" If you know the distance to the pulsar accurately , then you can work out how dense the WIM is and where it stops - in other words where the Galaxy 's edge is .
" Of the thousands of pulsars known in and around our Galaxy , only about 60 have really well known distances .
But to measure the thickness of the Milky Way we need to focus only on those that are sitting above or below the main part of the Galaxy ; it turns out that pulsars embedded in the main disk of the Milky Way do n't give us useful information . "
Choosing only the pulsars well above or below us cuts the number of measurements by a factor of three , but it is precisely this rejection of data points that makes The University of Sydney 's analysis different from previous work .
" Some colleagues have come up to me and have said ' That wrecks everything ! ' " says Professor Gaensler .
" And others have said ' Ah ! Now everything fits together ! ' "
The team 's results were presented in January this year at the 211th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin , Texas .

We spent the evening before Labor Day ( September 4th , 2006 ) preparing a special flier ( shown above ) , putting Renaissance costumes together , and fashioning signs .
The next day we traveled to the Minnesota Renaissance Festival and arrived somewhat later than we had intended — at around noon .
We were working on a minimal amount of sleep , but we were determined to remind people that impeachment remains timely and crucial to our democracy — and have some fun in the process .
We both wore signs reading " Impeach King George . "
One of us had a " Stop the Crusades " sign and the other had a " Restoreth Due Process " sign .
We walked all over the Renfest many times , passing out our fliers and calling out for Bush ’s impeachment in the most Elizabethan manner we could muster .
This meant speaking about the country as if it were a monarchy and a kingdom , as well as using phrases like " bloody hell " and " by jove " a lot .
It also meant using accents , which ( due to our somewhat dubious acting skills and general silliness ) shifted between upper and lower class English accents , morphing once in a while to Scottish and Irish accents , and even changing once or twice ( strangely ) to Australian accents .
Perhaps the highlight of our experience occurred when we entered the Festival parade .
Though we were n’t scheduled to be a part of it , we simply walked up and slipped in at the end , hoping that no one would notice that we did n’t belong .
Almost immediately after we stepped in line — and we still are n’t sure exactly why — the final installment of the parade ( two people carrying a picture of the backsides of two horses ) came up right behind us , ensuring that we looked entirely natural as members of the parade .
We got pretty bold as we walked through a crowd of thousands of people , calling in loud voices for all to hear for King George ’s impeachment on the grounds that he hath violated the law , committed torture , spied on his people , initiated crusades , and the like .
No one asked us to leave , so we saw the whole parade through !
As we went about our day , some Fest attendees were not immediately aware of who we meant by King George II .
We occasionally had to clarify that our quarrel was with he and not King Henry , the King of the Renaissance Festival .
Most people seemed to catch on pretty fast , though .
As always , there was some dissent .
One Fair attendee decided our flier should be used as toilet paper and graphically wiped himself with one before stuffing it inside one of our shirts .
Another engaged us in enthusiastic debate for about ten minutes before being reluctantly dragged away by a friend .
And of course , some people ignored us .
Last week saw many Hungarian BitTorrent trackers and warez sites shut down by the police .
Is it just a coincidence that the US is planning to put a federal prosecutor in Budapest , Hungary to " assist in the coordination of the enforcement of intellectual property laws " ?
Probably not .
Last week , Hungary witnessed some of the most aggressive action against BitTorrent trackers and warez sites the country has ever seen .
Normally considered a relative safe - haven for file - sharers , Hungarian police conducted raids on six locations using around 80 police officers to seize around a claimed 100 servers .
New information suggests this number has been exaggerated with the true number actually being around 30 .
In addition , home addresses were raided and hard drives seized .
Not only were the servers of torrent sites seized – such as those from Bithumen , BitLove , Moobs and GigaTorrents but also those of other warez sites , sms warez servers and 100 % legal game servers .
Other sites involved in the raids are Bitgate , Cinemastores , Darkside , Majomparade , Pretorians and Savaria which in true hydra - style have all returned .
The private BitTorrent tracker Bithumen is also promising to return using a backup from one - week ago and some are reassuring its users that the server did n’t carry any IP addresses so they cannot be identified , although this is unconfirmed .
It seems that many completely innocent parties have had their servers taken .
Although back now , the invite - only social networking site IWIW also went down temporarily during the raids .
According to a source , the Hungarian police were extremely short of technical staff who might be able to identify the correct servers to take , so in the style of the Swedish police at last year ’s Pirate Bay raid , they simply took them all .
The raids were co-ordinated by ASVA , a Hungarian industry association similar to the BSA and prompted many other torrent admins to take down their sites .
Some were showing messages indicating the sites were down for maintenance or had some sort of technical difficulties .
Interestingly , last week , news.com reported on the introduction of a bill in the US – the so - called ‘ Pirate Act ’ which would allow the US Justice Department to file lawsuits against those it accuses of engaging in copyright infringement and , by way of compensation , send the financial spoils to the organization holding the copyright .
Tucked away at the bottom of the article is a possible indicator as to why this massive action was taken in Hungary .
From the article :
The new version of the Pirate Act , in addition to civil enforcement , also : * Creates an “ operational unit ” of at least 10 FBI agents to investigate intellectual property offenses .
It requires the Justice Department to assign a federal prosecutor to Hong Kong and Budapest , Hungary , “ to assist in the coordination of the enforcement of intellectual property laws ” and allocates $ 12 million per year .
Although the Pirate Act is n’t in force yet , it ’s not difficult to imagine the pressure which the Hungarian government must ’ve been under from the United States .
Cleaning up the ‘ problem ’ before the US arrives to really turn on the screws should relieve some of that pressure .
Additionally , a lot of pressure data - wise was removed from the Hungarian internet infrastructure as disappearing sites caused a dramatic reduction in traffic .
As the dust settles it appears that torrent sites were not the main targets of the police but the pay to download warez sites , such as the ones which require payment by premium SMS message .
It ’s convenient for the authorities to portray torrent sites in the same light as pay warez sites and even though there is rarely a charge to use a torrent site , it ’s easy to imply to the general public that they ’re all criminals .
Further raids have been promised .

Airbus 's savings plan was drawn up when the dollar was stronger
And the firm once again warned that its cost saving plan would have to cut deeper to counter the impact of the weakening US currency .
Airbus is owned by European aerospace and defence group EADS .
" The dollar 's rapid decline is life - threatening for Airbus , " Mr Enders said in the speech to employees .
" The dollar exchange rate has gone beyond the pain barrier , " Mr Enders added .
And he said that Airbus 's entire business model needed reviewing as " reasonable processes of adjustment " were hardly possible now , he said .
' Break even '
Airbus is already shedding about 10,000 jobs and selling plants as part of its Power8 restructuring plan after delays to its A380 superjumbo drove the planemaker into a loss last year .
The dollar has hit new record lows against the euro this week , something which Airbus says favours its US rival Boeing .
Earlier this month Airbus warned it may have to deepen its planned restructuring after steeper than expected third - quarter losses .
It said a net loss of 776 m euros ( $ 1.14 bn ; £ 541 m ) - as against a loss of 189 m euros in 2006 - was down to delays with its A400 M military transport aircraft .
And it said full - year earnings would only " roughly break even " .
EADS said it might have to make more savings , as cost - cutting plans were drawn up when the euro was weaker .
And back in September , Airbus chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier said a further 1bn euros might have to be added to a savings plan which was originally based on a $ 1.35 euro .

-- A car bomb blew up in the capital ’s Shiite Muslim neighborhood of Sadr City on Thursday , killing at least four people , as a new survey suggested that the civilian death toll from the war could be more than 1 million .
The figure from ORB , a British polling agency that has conducted several surveys in Iraq , followed statements this week from the U.S. military defending itself against accusations it was trying to play down Iraqi deaths to make its strategy appear successful .
The military has said civilian deaths from sectarian violence have fallen more than 55 % since President Bush sent an additional 28,500 troops to Iraq this year , but it does not provide specific numbers .
According to the ORB poll , a survey of 1,461 adults suggested that the total number slain during more than four years of war was more than 1.2 million .
ORB said it drew its conclusion from responses to the question about those living under one roof : “ How many members of your household , if any , have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 ? ”
Based on Iraq ’s estimated number of households -- 4,050,597 -- it said the 1.2 million figure was reasonable .
There was no way to verify the number , because the government does not provide a full count of civilian deaths .
Neither does the U.S. military .
Both , however , say that independent organizations greatly exaggerate estimates of civilian casualties .
ORB said its poll had a margin of error of 2.4 % .
According to its findings , nearly one in two households in Baghdad had lost at least one member to war - related violence , and 22 % of households nationwide had suffered at least one death .
It said 48 % of the victims were shot to death and 20 % died as a result of car bombs , with other explosions and military bombardments blamed for most of the other fatalities .
The survey was conducted last month .
It was the highest estimate given so far of civilian deaths in Iraq .
Last year , a study in the medical journal Lancet put the number at 654,965 , which Iraq ’s government has dismissed as “ ridiculous . ”
The car bomb in Sadr City injured at least 10 people and set fire to several shops .
Also Thursday , police said they had found the bodies of nine people believed to be victims of sectarian killings across the capital .
In its latest salvo at Iran , the U.S. military accused the Islamic Republic of providing the 240 - millimeter rocket that earlier this week slammed into Camp Victory , the sprawling base that houses the U.S. Army headquarters .
The attack on the base near Baghdad ’s airport injured 11 soldiers and killed one “ third - country national . ”
At a news conference , a military spokesman , Army Brig .
Gen. Kevin Bergner , displayed a chunk of metal that he said had come from the rocket .
Asked how he could be sure it was of Iranian origin , Bergner said its color and markings were unique to rockets from Iran .
The United States accuses Iran ’s Shiite leaders of providing weapons , training and other assistance to Shiite militias fighting U.S. forces in Iraq .
Iran denies the accusation .

Haskell Development Support
Summary
Provide good support for Haskell development and use , with a high number of quality libraries and tools available .
Owner
Name : YaakovNemoy
Current status
Targeted release : Fedora ?
Last updated : 2008-09-24
Percentage of completion : 75 %
Complete enough to be considered a ' feature '
The idea of how spec files should look is complete , but there are still minor bugs
ToDo ( Targeting a Fedora 10 Release )
These tasks will guarantee the sustainability of this feature
Get at least 20 packages in and supported Get at least one dedicated reviewer to reviewing Haskell packages , with good knowledge about Haskell and GHC
For long term ToDo tasks , see the Test Plan
Detailed Description
Haskell is a very powerful language with growing usage .
Currently Fedora support for Haskell is minimal .
Many developers , scientists , and other technically oriented people are drawn away from Fedora for a lack of Haskell support .
There are also a number of applications written in Haskell that require at least some level of support to include them in Fedora and to keep them up to date .
This includes :
xmonad - A window manager
xmobar - A display bar program for X
pugs - A Perl 6 implementation
darcs - a source control management program
Yi - an editor that can be programmed in Haskell
Meep - Meep ( or MEEP ) is a free finite - difference time - domain ( FDTD ) simulation software package developed at MIT to model electromagnetic systems .
Frob - an Embedded Domain Specific Language for controlling robots .
It is built using the principals of Functional Reactive Programming , as developed by Conal Elliott for the Fran animation system .
The current incarnation of Frob is part of the Yampa FRP system .
hpaste - a pastebin written in Haskell
Haskell is also a very popular language for any sort of 3D rendering , and there are a number of applications devoted to it .
Good Haskell support would be useful for a wide variety of Desktop Spins .
Benefit to Fedora
Good Haskell support would make Fedora and family available to a wide variety of users .
It would encourage growth within technical circles that are tech savvy but also focused on their particular fields .
Scope
To start , getting some basic support in beyond just the few core packages available today .
Furthermore , this could be something to be passed along to the Ambassador team so that they can present Fedora to different scientific and other technical groups as a solid base to work from .
The hope is to have this included in Fedora 10 , so that it can also be a part of RHEL 6 , as rumors suggest this is going to be the base for that .
Test Plan
Write Package Guidelines - Done Include a number of libraries and programs - In Progress Double check that / etc /rpm / macros.ghc exists on a system with GHC installed Get them tested by people to make sure there are no mess - ups
This depends on the nature of each package .
Test this on as many architectures as possible
Make sure packages can be built on as many architectures that GHC supports
Future ideas
Evaluate foreign function interface libraries between haskell and other libraries and virtual machines ( Not necessarily Fedora 9 ) Implement a collection of FFI libs , to broaden access to libraries
What else goes here ?
User Experience
The user will see some new programs available .
The developer will have access to more libraries in Haskell , and an ease of use in programming in and for Fedora using Haskell .
This will not affect anyone not using Haskell .
Dependencies
Dedicated Package Reviewing
Contingency Plan
Since the guidelines are in place , and the ghc package is patched to match this , there is nothing that needs to be ' rolledback ' any further .
Documentation
Release Notes
Fedora 10 introduces better support for Haskell .
With a new set of packaging guidelines and tools , it is incredibly easy to support any Haskell program using the Glasgow Haskell Compiler .
Package creation and deployment , leveraging Fedora 's quality tools plus a few new friends has never been easier .
As support for Haskell grows there will be continued development for Haskell as more libraries are introduced .
Package creation is quite simple .
Haskell already provides the infrastructure for compiling and deploying packages consistently .
Setting up a package for Fedora takes very little time , meaning code that works in Haskell will work in Fedora too .
Fedora also provides tools for enterprise deployment of Fedora packages .
With the inclusion of Haskell in Fedora , the developer is now free to write enterprise level applications in Haskell and feel secure knowing the code can be use in Fedora .
The word " change " quickly became a jaw - grindingly overused term on the presidential campaign trail in the last week , but Tuesday 's debut of a colorful new book chronicling the ongoing chicanery in politics reminds us why so many Iowans were eager for it .
In his hilarious - yet - disgusting political memoir How to Rig An Election , former GOP operative Allen Raymond and ghostwriter Ian Spiegelman lay bare his role in the Republicans ' 2002 Election Day scheme to jam the get - out - the - vote phone lines run by the New Hampshire Democrats and some local firefighters .
The book arrives the same day New Hampshire voters once again go to the polls to choose presidential nominees , a time when robocalls , e-mails , online videos and other artifacts of political sophistry fly around the ether .
Raymond 's tale from the inside is worth reading just to gain a sense of perspective on all this highly politicized and often misleading targeted messaging .
Raymond 's criminal political shenanigans came in 2002 as Republican John Sununu ( New Hampshire ) was battling former Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen for a seat in the U.S. Senate , a race Sununu wound up winning .
In 2000 , Raymond , a longtime GOP operative , launched a political telemarketing startup called GOPMarketplace.com .
In October 2002 , Republican Party regional official James Tobin and the executive director of New Hampshire Republican State Committee , Chuck McGee , asked him to jam Democrat 's ' get - out - the - vote efforts .
( Tobin was at the time responsible for overseeing senate campaigns in several New England states on behalf of the Republican National Committee . )
Raymond consulted lawyers about the phone - jamming scheme and as soon as they informed him that the clearly unethical act was n't illegal , he quickly hired an Idaho phone - banking firm for the job .
After unleashing 800 calls in one hour on the Democratic phone banks on Election Day – a kind of denial - of - service attack , he received a frantic phone call from McGee himself urging him to stop the jamming because McGee had discovered that it was illegal .
From then on , Raymond was on his own , and it 's clear that he 's bitter about every aspect of his phone - jamming caper .
He 's angry about being abandoned by his Republican co-conspirators ; at the U.S. attorneys who went after him ; and especially at Tobin 's expensive defense attorney at the white - shoe law firm of Williams & Connolly , who is portrayed as especially incompetent .
In Raymond 's telling , the phone - jamming scheme reached up the ranks to the top echelons of the Republican National Committee and even to the White House .
In his estimation , nobody in the RNC would cook up such a scheme without prior authorization from the top .
" The Bush White House had complete control of the RNC and there was no way someone like Tobin was going to try what he was proposing without first getting it vetted by his higher - ups , " Raymond writes .
Like any other tell - all boiler - room tale , it 's the gossipy details of this political story that make it interesting .
Fallen House Speaker Newt Gingrich , for example , " was a very bright guy , and … he went off on impossible tangents ....
During a member orientation meeting , he started talking about the future , the Contract with America and the next hundred days – and before I knew it he was discussing the possibility of farming on Mars . "
Meanwhile , Georgia House Republican Bob Barr was " a backwoods knucklehead , " who was " using sex to become the face of the Republican Party , " referring to Barr 's grandstanding in the Clinton impeachment proceedings .
Aside from these brutally frank assessments , Raymond 's message is ultimately earnest :
He tells Americans that the reason they got stuck with two terms of President Bush 's megalomaniac administration is because " election operatives like myself and the kind of politicians who hire us have ensured that idealists can't win elections . "
And the tricks will just keep getting nastier , according to Raymond .
Since the New Hampshire attorney general is already investigating a 2008 presidential campaign phone " push poll " that targeted Republican senator John McCain from Arizona , it seems that his prediction is inevitably coming true .
It 's just tragic that ethically tone - deaf people like Raymond do n't have more insight into how recklessly irresponsible their careers are until they have a few months in the slammer to start living an examined life .
The most likely path of asteroid 2004 MN4 on April 13 , 2029 will bring it so close to Earth that gravity will significantly alter its course .
BOULDER , Colorado -
The potential for a newly discovered asteroid smacking into the Earth in 2036 cannot be discounted .
NASA has sketched out a response strategy inthe outside possibility that the space rock becomes a true threat .
NASA 'saction plan was the result of prodding by a group of astronauts , scientists andother technical specialists uneasy about the current lack of action to protectthe Earth from the impact of near Earth objects ( NEOs ) .
Theobject was found last year through the efforts of NASA 's Spaceguard Survey .
In1998 NASA formally initiated the Spaceguard Survey by adopting the objective offinding 90 percent of the near Earth asteroids larger than 3,280 feet ( onekilometer ) diameter within the next decade - before the end of 2008 .
Asteroid99942 Apophis - first labeled as 2004 MN4 -- is estimated to be roughly 1,000 feet ( 320 meters ) in diameter .
Were it to strike Earth , it would not set off global havocbut would generate significant local or regional damage , experts say .
Worrisometo asteroid watchers is the exceptionally close flyby of Earth by Apophis onApril 13 , 2029 .
So close in fact , the space rock will be naked - eye visible asit darts by .
And what can't be ruled out at this time is that Apophis may passthrough a gravitational " keyhole " - a spot that alters the asteroid ' strajectory as it zips by our planet and might put it on the bee - line lane forbanging into Earth seven years later .
Issueof critical importance
Concernover asteroid Apophis and the ability to precisely chart its trajectory -- andtake steps if needed to deflect the object -- were fervently voiced by the B612 Foundation , chaired by Russell Schweickart , a former Apollo astronaut .
Thegroup requested that NASA carry out an analysis that included the possibilityof placing an active radio transponder on the object .
Doing so at a fairlyearly date would yield the requisite orbital accuracy of the asteroid as itsped through space .
Ina June 6 letter to NASA Administrator , Michael Griffin , Schweickart on behalfof the B612 Foundation called for support in " resolving an issue of criticalimportance " - namely whether a scientific mission should be launched toasteroid Apophis in the near term .
Sucha probe , if dispatched , Schweickart stated , would provide knowledge of theasteroid 's orbit in time to initiate a deflection mission in the unlikely eventone should be required .
The position of the B612 Foundation was that themission should be staged , pointing out that NASA 's NEO program personnelapparently did not concur with that view .
A spacecraft mission to Apophis wouldaugment tracking of the object from the ground , the letter to Griffinexplained , and also carry out a number of scientific duties too .

NASAprovided a formal response to the B612 Foundation 's June communique via anOctober 12 letter from Mary Cleave , Associate Administrator for Science MissionDirectorate .
ThatNASA reply came with an appended detailed analysis by Steven Chesley of NASA'SNEO Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California .
The study by Chesley dug into Apophis ' orbit , under varyingconditions , and contained other items pertaining to the space agency 's findingsabout the Apophis matter .
" Thekey conclusion to be taken from this analysis , " Cleave explained in the letter , " is that aggressive ( i.e. , more expensive ) action can reasonably be delayeduntil after the 2013 observing opportunity .
For Apophis , the 16 years availableafter 2013 are sufficient to recognize and respond to any hazard that stillexists after that time . "
Cleavenoted in the letter that while Apophis " is an object whose motion we willcontinue to monitor closely in the coming years , we conclude a space mission tothis object based solely on any perceived collision hazard is not warranted atthis time . "
Notruled out by Cleave , however , is the prospect of Discovery - class , low - costmissions sent to Apophis , " based on purely scientific arguments , " she said .
" Indeed , the asteroid 's orbit is particularly attractive for spacecraft rendezvous , and the extraordinary close encounter in April 2029 provides a unique opportunityto investigate a number of scientific NEO issues , " Cleave explained in theletter .
Pinpointing the object 's whereabouts
WhileSchweickart said that the NASA response to the B612 Foundation 's concern is astep forward , there are other issues still to be resolved .
Onematter involves radar tracking of Apophis .
Onone hand , radar plays a crucial role in being able to rationally determine thefuture likelihood of a NEO impact and potentially in planning for a deflectionmission when required .
Yetthe availability of NEO radar tracking , and the budgets to support this work inthe future is highly uncertain , even precarious , Schweickart and the B612 Foundation emphasize .
Radar hits of Apophis at each opportunity through 2021 are important to keep watch of the object 's whereabouts .
" Trackingthese asteroids once you know they exist and pinning down their orbits isreally not science , " Schweickart told SPACE.com .
" This is public safety .
It 's disaster preparedness . "
Begging time and bumming bucks
WhenApophis swings by Earth , Schweickart said the asteroid will likely change itsorbit .
Also , its spin characteristics may be altered .
Due to Earth 's gravitytugging on the object , " asteroid quakes " could reshape Apophis , he said .
Moreover , still far from resolution is a " who's in charge " proclamation about troublemakingNEOs , Schweickart said .
" Itwould be great if we had NASA doing this as a regular process .
Unfortunately , the mindset that 's essentially required by their budget is to think aboutdiscovery , not to think about the potential need for deflection , " Schweickartadded .
" Until your mindset is oriented that way , you 're going to miss things . "
Untilan agency is identified that is responsible for all of this , Schweickartcautioned , everybody is " begging time and bumming bucks " from some otherprogram .
" This whole thing is sort of in a precarious position until somebodygets around to assigning agency responsibility , " he said .
Japan 's Hayabusa mission
Regardingthe skill required to deposit a transponder on Apophis , Schweickart saluted Japan 'sHayabusa asteroid sample - return mission , now in progress .
Thatcraft is scheduled to make two landings on its target asteroid - Itokawa -- later this month .
The mission is geared to haul back samples of the object toEarth .
Scientistsat Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science ( ISAS ) are workingday - by - day issues in readying the probe for contact with the asteroid , including release of a mini- robot onto Itokawa that will move about and surveyits rocky surroundings .
ISAS is a research arm of the Japan AerospaceExploration Agency ( JAXA ) .
" It 'san impressive mission , " Schweickart said , sure to yield operational experienceand lessons learned on how best to execute duties on asteroid Apophis .
Global preparedness
Theruin stemming from asteroid Apophis colliding with Earth would potentially bevery great .
Indeed , the consequences , Schweickart suggested , would dwarf those seen as a result ofthe Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 , hurricanes Katrina and Rita inSeptember of this year , and the Pakistan earthquake last month .
Inregards to global preparedness in handling these unusually devastating eventsof late , " it 's basically out of sight ... out of mind , " Schweickart said .
" That 'sthe real challenge for society .
The things that you do n't know about are onething .
But the things that you do know about , and do n't do somethingabout ... those are the ones that are really tough . "
Refine the impact probability
Fullyconcurring with NASA 's response is Alan Harris , a senior research scientist andasteroid expert for the Space Science Institute headquartered here .
Harrisnoted , as has been underscored by the B612 Foundation , that if Apophis isindeed on an impact trajectory , then ground - based radar observations will notbe able to refine the impact probability to greater than 20 percent .
" That is , we would still not know better than one - chance - in - five whether the impact wouldreally occur or not , " he told SPACE.com .
" Wereally would need a transponder to improve tracking enough to firmly establishthat an impact would occur , " Harris said .
Whathas been overlooked , or at best under - emphasized , Harris added , is a pointraised in the NASA response .
Ground - only tracking has a 99.8 percent chance ofeliminating any chance at all of an impact .
Thus , there is only one - chance - in - 500 that ground - based tracking will fail to resolve the issue in favor of noimpact .
" For this reason I think the NASA conclusion is entirelysensible , " he said .
Wait and see strategy
Harrissaid that there are Apophis observing opportunities every 6 - 8 years , with eachone having about a 90 percent chance of eliminating any possibleimpact .
At each of these " shoulder " times , he said , one can re-evaluatethe " wait and see " strategy if the impact possibility does not go away .
" Certainlyit seems appropriate to play the ' wait and see ' game until after the 2013observing opportunity , " Harris stated .
None of this diminishes the opening that Apophis presents for purely scientific investigations , which could incidentallycontribute to the NEO hazard issue , he said .
Harrissaid that he would not recommend a " deep impact " type of scientific mission , " lest we have the misfortune to deflect it into a keyhole , but other than that , Apophis is a very attractive mission target . "
A coming of age
AsteroidApophis , and the discussions it has sparked are welcomed , observed DavidMorrison , a space scientist and asteroid specialist at NASA 's Ames ResearchCenter , situated in Silicon Valley , California .
" I am pleased that this dialog is taking place , " Morrison said .
" This is thefirst time that serious possibilities for dealing with a real butlow - probability future impact have been discussed in a technically professionalway , rather than receiving the ' Hollywood treatment ' " .
Morrisonsaid that he considers it remarkable that the Spaceguard Survey has reached the
level of maturity where such an asteroid could not only be found , but its orbitunderstood well enough to deal with " keyholes " and other subtleties .
" Apophisrepresents for me a symbol of the coming of age of Spaceguard and of asteroidimpact studies in general , " he said .
The possibility of Apophis hitting Earth on April 13 , 2036 is real , Morrisonsaid , even if the probabilities now seem to be very small .
" These probabilitiesrepresent uncertainties in our knowledge of the orbit , not a failure of thescience . "
Butwhether the asteroid will strike Earth or not , Morrison concluded , the challengeis to resolve which case is correct .
" With more observations over a longer timespan , we will be able to tie this down . "
University of Sussex astronomers predict that the Earth will be swallowed up by the Sun unless the Earth ’s orbit can be altered - but we have about 7.6 billion years to do it .
Dr Robert Smith , Emeritus Reader in Astronomy , said his team previously calculated that the Earth would escape ultimate destruction , although be battered and burnt to a cinder , but they did not take into account the effect of the drag caused by the outer atmosphere of the dying Sun .
He says : " We showed previously that , as the Sun expanded , it would lose mass in the form of a strong wind , much more powerful than the current solar wind .
This would reduce the gravitational pull of the Sun on the Earth , allowing the Earth 's orbit to move outwards , ahead of the expanding Sun .
“ If that were the only effect the Earth would indeed escape final destruction .
However , the tenuous outer atmosphere of the Sun extends a long way beyond its visible surface , and it turns out the Earth would actually be orbiting within these very low density outer layers .
The drag caused by this low - density gas is enough to cause the Earth to drift inwards , and finally to be captured and vaporised by the Sun . ”
The new paper was written in collaboration with Dr Klaus - Peter Schroeder , previously at Sussex , who is now in the Astronomy Department of the University of Guanajuato in Mexico .
Life on Earth will have disappeared long before 7.6 billion years , however .
Scientists have shown that the Sun 's slow expansion will cause the temperature at the surface of the Earth to rise .
Oceans will evaporate , and the atmosphere will become laden with water vapour , which ( like carbon dioxide ) is a very effective greenhouse gas .
Eventually , the oceans will boil dry and the water vapour will escape into space .
In a billion years from now the Earth will be a very hot , dry and uninhabitable ball .
Can anything be done to prevent this fate ?
Professor Smith points to a remarkable scheme proposed by a team at Santa Cruz University , who suggest harnessing the gravitational effects of a close passage by a large asteroid to " nudge " the Earth 's orbit gradually outwards away from the encroaching Sun .
A suitable passage every 6000 years or so would be enough to keep the Earth out of trouble and allow life to survive for at least 5 billion years , and possibly even to survive the Sun 's red giant phase .
“ This sounds like science fiction , ” says Professor Smith .
“ But it seems that the energy requirements are just about possible and the technology could be developed over the next few centuries . ”
However , it is a high - risk strategy - a slight miscalculation , and the asteroid could actually hit the Earth , with catastrophic consequences .
“ A safer solution may be to build a fleet of interplanetary ' life rafts ' that could manoeuvre themselves always out of reach of the Sun , but close enough to use its energy , ” he adds .

George W. Bush is a heartbeat away from having to become president of the United States , a heartbeat that is becoming more and more tenuous .
The heartbeat I am referring to of course is that of Dick Cheney , who has been shouldering the duties of the presidency since its current inception , and whose ticker needed a jump - start early this week in order to resume normal heart rhythm after displaying atrial fibrillation .
I would have provided him with my home remedy that involves a motorcycle battery , a pair of alligator clips and two vice - presidential nipples but I wasn�t asked .
While one might easily confuse the two , atrial fibrillation is not the result of the tremendous amount fibbing that President Cheney has been doing lately .
It comes instead from eating lots of steak and spending time on the phone making sure one�s constituents are sufficiently wealthy .
Cheney has real cause for concern .
He has had four heart attacks , two artery - clearing angioplasties , one quadruple bypass surgery , and an operation to implant a defibrillator that monitors his heartbeat .
In July , he had surgery to replace the defibrillator .
This guy makes the Tin Man look like Lance Armstrong .
He must have more zippers than George Bush�s airman costume .
When Cheney walked toward a senile Joe Garigiola in the sauna last week , Joe said , � Curve ball , I think it�s breaking left . �
There�s no real cause to rejoice though , because if acting President Dick Cheney dies , the honor of selecting George W. Bush�s new puppet master would ostensibly fall to Bush himself .
Of course the Republican National Committee will make sure he picks the right stooge and then run the show by committee from an undisclosed location in much the same way it has been done for the past seven years .
It being much easier to leave things the way they are , however , an elite medical unit was assembled to put Humpty Dumpty back together again .
Once the skeptical surgical team determined that Cheney actually had a heart , they went to work immediately to correct its rhythm .
The elite physicians determined that , like many soulless white people , Cheney�s heart was clapping on the one and the three .
� Honestly , it was like watching a Debbie Boone concert , � said lead surgeon Kwame Adebayo .
� It �s back to normal now . �
According to a recent Associated Press report , � The main treatment is to try an electrical shock to restore normal heartbeat .
If that doesn�t work , patients may need to take the blood thinner Warfarin to reduce stroke risk .�
Let me back up the tape for a second : � If that doesn�t work , patients may need to take the blood thinner Warfarin to reduce stroke risk .�
I�m not kidding .
The blood thinner that Cheney is taking is called Warfarin .
One has to assume that Warfarin was prescribed in Cheney�s case because of his fondness for the apostrophic version of the word .
I can see Cheney turning beet red in his Johnny and stalking the hospital hallway like General George S. Patton addressing his troops .
� Warfarin� men have charted the evolution of society since the Mongolian hordes and before .
I loves me some warfarin� men .
Hannibal !
Napoleon !
Rommel !
Genghis Khan !
G-r-r-r-r-r-r-r ! Churchill !
G-r-r-r-r-r-r ! Charlemagne !
Mao Tse - Tung !!
Hitl � um , all of the great warriors !!!�
I imagine the Nurse Ratchet version of the hospital staff at the D.C. hospital of choice suffering Cheney�s tirade , but indeed topping off his syringe just a little more than the other patients .
� Where�s that Warfarin ?
Make mine a double dose !
Make my blood so thin I have no conscience at all !
Wait , it �s too late for that .
Whatever , never mind .
G-r-r-r-r-r-r !
See how unwittingly aware I can be ?
R-r-r-a-a-r - r-r! G-r-r-r-r-r !!
R-a-a-o-o-w-w-w !!!
Let �s fare some war !
Let�s war some fare !
Let �s fare some unfair warfare !
G - r - r -r-r-r !!!�
You could say that Cheney was using Warfarin as a preemptive stroke .
After all , he�s done very similar things before with warfarin� , why not with Warfarin ?
He has bumbled into sovereign nations armed with faulty intelligence and warfarin� , and achieved results that are the opposite of the intention .
Hopefully his current strategy will have equally catastrophic results with Warfarin , and subsequent to the giddily anticipated final heart attack , people won�t be fooled by the robot with the Cheney carcass over it that the RNC would attempt before ceding even the vice presidency to anyone who wasn�t already a shill for the corporatocracy .
Best wishes to the veep�s family , but I submit this devil to the ghoul pool ; the rest of the world would benefit by his absence .
What was a serious problem for the White House has now doubled , and Jack Cafferty is all over it :
Download Download
Cafferty : A government watchdog group now says more than 10 million White House emails are missing .
Citizens for the Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) described this massive hole in White House email records last April .
At that time they thought the number was 5 million - Now they say it is more than 10 million emails .
In one of the great understatements of this here Christmas season , the group says that this revised estimate - quote - highlights that this is a very serious and systematic problem at the White House - unquote .
Both CREW and another private group called the National Security archive are suing the Bush administration to try to get information about all these missing emails .
The White House email problems first came to light during special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald 's investigation into the leak of CIA officer Valerie Plame 's identity .
It 's worth noting what a critical time period these missing emails represent .
Why it 's from March of 2003 to October 2005 .
That would include the start of the Iraq War right up through the aftermath of Katrina .
As the director of one of these groups put it :
It does n't get more historically valuable than that .
Given the way the White House handled both the war and Katrina , it 's also quite convenient that suddenly this mountain of stuff is missing .
By the way it 's against the law that these emails be destroyed or lost .
They are supposed to be saved .
The Presidential Records Act of 1978 mandates White House communications be preserved .
Another law broken --
Another example of nobody doing a damn thing about it .
Pope Caught Orchestrating Church Pedophile Cover Up Posted by Pile ( 83096 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Pubic Relations ]
A BBC documentary has exposed that Pope Benedict XVI , aka Cardinal Ratzinger , played a leading role in a systematic cover - up of child sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests .
In 2001 , while he was a cardinal , he issued a secret Vatican edict to Catholic bishops all over the world , instructing them to put the Church 's interests ahead of child safety .
The document recommended that rather than reporting sexual abuse to the relevant legal authorities , bishops should encourage the victim , witnesses and perpetrator not to talk about it .
And , to keep victims quiet , it threatened that if they repeat the allegations they would be excommunicated .
A secret document which sets out a procedure for dealing with child sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church is examined by BBC documentary show Panorama .
Crimen Sollicitationis was enforced for 20 years by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger before he became the Pope .
It instructs bishops on how to deal with allegations of child abuse against priests and has been seen by few outsiders .
Critics say the document has been used to evade prosecution for sex crimes .
Crimen Sollicitationis was written in 1962 in Latin and given to Catholic bishops worldwide who are ordered to keep it locked away in the church safe .
It instructs them how to deal with priests who solicit sex from the confessional .
It also deals with " any obscene external act ... with youths of either sex . "
It imposes an oath of secrecy on the child victim , the priest dealing with the allegation and any witnesses .
Breaking that oath means excommunication from the Catholic Church .
Reporting for Panorama , Colm O'Gorman finds seven priests with child abuse allegations made against them living in and around the Vatican City .
One of the priests , Father Joseph Henn , has been indicted on 13 molestation charges brought by a grand jury in the United States .
During filming for Sex Crimes and the Vatican , Colm finds Father Henn is fighting extradition orders from inside the headquarters of this religious order in the Vatican .
The Vatican has not compelled him to return to America to face the charges against him .
After filming , Father Henn lost his fight against extradition but fled the headquarters and is believed to be hiding in Italy while there is an international warrant for his arrest .
Colm O'Gorman was raped by a Catholic priest in the diocese of Ferns in County Wexford in Ireland when he was 14 years old .
Father Fortune was charged with 66 counts of sexual , indecent assault and another serious sexual offence relating to eight boys but he committed suicide on the eve of his trial .
Colm started an investigation with the BBC in March 2002 which led to the resignation of Dr Brendan Comiskey , the bishop leading the Ferns Diocese .
Colm then pushed for a government inquiry which led to the Ferns Report .
It was published in October 2005 and found : " A culture of secrecy and fear of scandal that led bishops to place the interests of the Catholic Church ahead of the safety of children . "
The Catholic Church has 50 million children in its worldwide congregation and no universal child protection policy although in the UK there is the Catholic Office for the Protection of Children & Vulnerable Adults .
In some countries this means that the Crimen Sollicitationis is the only policy followed .
The Vatican has refused repeated requests from Panorama to respond to any of the cases shown in the film .

Thank you for carrying this article .
As with so much else in its history of inquistions , pogroms , papal whoremongering , complicity with Hitler etc. this simply illustrates what Roman Catholicism is : a whorehouse with a cross on the roof run by gansters and child molesting perverts .
It is also demonstrates what Roman Catholicism is not - it is not what Jesus Christ ever taught but is rather a spiritually and morally bankrupt monument to religious hypocrisy , corruption , and tieranny of the lowest kind .
Due to my mother I was brought up Roman Catholic .
After reading the New Testament however I renounced Catholicism and converted to Christianity .
I can only feel compassion for Catholic people .
I hope they renounce this child abusing den of Satanic treachery run by theocratic hoodlums and rather consider the real teachings of Jesus as an alternative .
Sincerely ,
JJ Prasch Posted by ueberbill on 2006-10 - 10 15:56:08
Do n't know if I would refer to it as a " child abusing den of Satanic treachery " as that 's a little ... crazy .
It certainly is a dangerously insular ancient organization with deadly serious accountability problems , though .
But to try to balance out the Catholic church 's horrors , I would point to its role in the preservation of early civilization through the long dark ages ( read the really excellent " How The Irish Saved Civilization " for proof ) .
I 'm not entirely defending the big C but I do think that it has done some good throughout human history .
Posted by Manuel D. Mirabal on 2006-10 - 18 20:09:46
I feel that the Catholic Church has been a safe haven for the sexually aberrant for almost two millenia .
This is to be expected of an organization that denies equality to women in the ministry and continues its tenacity concerning celibacy for priests .
It is true that the CC has done , and continues to do , much good in the world , but that will never erase all the injustice , the pain and suffering , or the tyranny exercised by the CC whenever it has been able to influence secular government .
Protestant churches have also been guilty of the latter .

The catholic church has done everything possible to stop the gospel of christ from reaching the people [ banning the bible , burning people alive for translating the bible into their own language ] .
Either worship the pope / catholic church or worship Christ , the choice is yours .

The post by " postnlink.net " on 2007 - 07 - 11 which said that " August 7 , 2007 ... is the collapse of the Roman Catholic Church " was totally wrong .
Today is January 16 , 2008 .
The Roman Catholic Church is still around .
No " biblical event " transpired on " August 7 , 2007 " .
Why is it that religious prophecies which were total BS are never admitted to after they did not come true ?
Why is it that those who profess to know " the truth " never admit when they are proven wrong ?
I am an ex-Catholic .
I am in no way defending the Catholic Church .
I hope that those in the Catholic Church who covered up abuses , including Pope Ratzinger , are held accountable by courts .
But making false prophecies and then never admitting you were wrong , does n't help to hold the Catholic Church accountable .
Rather , it shows that you too believe in your church 's ( whatever church that may be ) infallibility instead of standing up against wrongdoing .

A Christian is a person who adheres to Christianity , a monotheistic religion centered on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ as presented in the New Testament and interpreted by Christians to have been prophesied in the Hebrew Bible / Old Testament .
How could you convert from being a Christian into a Christian ?
Yah lives
Posted by Yahshuah Our Righteousness on 2008-04-10 15:22:45 Read Revelation 17 " Names of blasphemy " : ( DOMINUM DEUM NOSTRUM PAPAM -" THE LORD OUR GOD THE POPE " - on one of the tiaras ( head piece ) of the Vatican " king . "
It is clear that " THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH , MYSTERY " .. is none other than the Catholic Church .
Constantine in the 4th Century did not spread or promote Christianity .
Catholic Jesuit priests have controlled mainstream history texts books in the same manner as the Catholic Church controlled the confiscation of the Holy Bible for 1,260 years - to the Reformation - as biblical prophecy recorded .
The " synogogue of satan " in the Book of Revelation is the same Catholic Church - the church of the antichrist .
The Catholic Church was NEVER the Christian church or church of Christ .
The Cath .
Church from the beginning - with Constantine ( very wicked man ) - spread terror - any one who refused to submit to the Catholic Church was slaughtered .
This continued for centuries .
Now the Catholic Church hides behind such leaders as Hitler ; and now , Bush - who is leading many nations to annihilate many innocent in Iraq , Afghanistan , Palestine , and elsewhere - claiming to represent a Christian nation and Bush claims that " God " tells him what to do .
His " god " is none other than Satan .
Even as he worships Molech at the Bohemian Grove , San Fransisco ; ( see Wikipedia ) the same false god that represents satan ; terrorizing and sacrificing young children
to their false god ; to obtain power by WITCHCRAFTS .
This is the means of power the Catholic Church exerts - by her witchcrafts and her fornications and murders ; spoken of in Revelation 17 .
According to prophecy , soon the Vatican will burn by the hand of the " ten kings " which are the " ten toes " of the beast .
See Revelation 19 .
Make no mistake - the end of the wicked has come .
In these days you will see it .
The Creator is great in mercy and calls sinners to repent ; but those that
remain in their shame will suffer everlasting contempt and torment .
This is the righteous judgment from the Creator whose name is holy .
Yahshuah , Yahovah is his mighty name .
( The Catholic Church took the true name out and put " Jesus " , " Lord " . )
Christ Yahshuah was never called " Jesus " in Bethlehem or in heaven .
His Great and Terrible name is Yahovah - " Yah ( is ) Eternal . "
When our Savior came to the world in the flesh to lay down his life for us ; his name at birth : " Yahshuah " - " Yah ( is ) Our Salvation " - his name is full of power and glory .
... and I say , " Yah bless you , out of Zion . "

People , How do you know a Christian ?
Who do they say Jesus is ?
Simple as that .
The doctrine part is NOT what proves someone is or is not a follower of christ .
Oh and all you converters ?
Do n't kid yourselves , there are just as many perverters of the gospel and hypocrites in the fundamentalist churches .
Probably more .
Stop the hate .
The Pope does NOT think hes God and Think about the history of the the protestant churches atrocities up to and including this present day .
From scandal to scandal , both nationally and in our local churches , the fundamentalists keep covering up for their oun peodophile and gay pastors while they throw their victims under the bus .
Just concentrate on the saving grace of Christ folks .

Why have they covered it up and why are they able to continue to do it .
Its disgusting !
My children were baptised catholics .
I am currently looking into new religions .
I will not be part of a church that would simply cover up known child sex abuse .
Moving their preiests around so they can continue raping innocent children .
It makes my blood boil !!!
They can't represent christianity or our god and jesus .
I just want to know how they justify their vile perverse behavour under the eyes of god .

Any time we as humans say someone speaks for God we have given that person the power of God .
I think Absolute power corrupts absolutely .
While this act by the current Pope is in the news now , the corruption is in every Church of every religion that gives someone in that organization the power to speak for their god .
I left my church when I was old enough to know racism and bigotry were wrong .
Make your own decisions , read the Bible or other religious texts yourself .
Follow your understanding of the whole of the teachings of your religion not just some small part .
If you read the old testament you will see even God could not foretell the future .
Think of Noah and Moses .
Love your neighbors and your enemies .

A worldwide epidemic of sodomy is now taking place .
An international tribunal administrated by the UN should be formed to investigate all claims of sexual abuse .
Immunity should be given to religious leaders that confess to their sins , and point the finger at other sodomites .
Those found guilty should be forced to attend sexual rehabilitation centers and carefully monitored to make sure that they never sodomize another person again .
Sexually abnormal are not holier than sexually normal ones .

I 'm not sure what the surprise is .
I grew up in a predominantly Catholic area , and the Catholic clergy really spooked me .
When you looked them in the eye you could see they were n't right .
When I grew up and encountered the organization again in a Catholic University I saw it again , but this time I put it together .
This is an organization that basically has a sign in the HR office that says , " Sexually normal people need not apply . "
Some people may not know what sexual normalcy is .
You 're sexually normal when you openly court someone you 're not ashamed of , and if the courtship is successful , you form a devoted and exclusive relationship with that person , and present yourselves to the community .
And when you 're alone you get better every time you do it .
People ought to try it .
My husband of 15 years is dead now , so I am alone .
But that was the way to live .
I should say I had two other marriages that both ran for years and those men are the bio-dads of my children ...
I hate to say the earlier ones and I divorced .
That 's what the papers say , but they sort of morphed into brothers - in - law or something .
I think the term is " we grew apart " .
But we still get along .
Their wives are like sisters - in - law to me .
Ex-wives , too .
There 's one of those , and she partly raised one of my sons .
And none of the 6 children produced were ever abused by an adult , or broken off from one parent or the other .
They were mostly raised by me and my last husband , but various kids joined the other couples at various times .
Everyone is open - hearted and whole .
This is normal , honest life .
Not twisted .
And it 's the one and only one kind of person the Catholic Church refuses to employ in responsible positions .
Hirees must at least pretend in public to have no libido , each day of their life , so even if you like people of the opposite sex that are age - appropriate you have to be willing to sneak around , because you have to pretend to have no libido .
What 's wrong with just allowing the hiring of SOME sexually normal people .
SOME .
Then you would at least have someone who could keep an eye on all the sexual mutants .
Oh .
I forgot .
It 's a 100 % sexually mutant organization .
It just FEEDS on people who are sexually normal .
And apparently fairly dense .
I 'm sexually normal , and I can spot these people across a room .
I would never EVER apply for a job in such a business .
I think it just needs to be shut down .
The early poster is correct .
It 's Satanic .
And furthermore ...
Posted by Anna Nimm on 2010-03-31 03:36:31
How can you give a tax exemption to a corporation that openly and flat - footedly refuses to hire sexually normal people , and then act all surprised when there 's nobody in the organization but sexual perpetrators and their enablers .
In that sense , the government has to be in on this , too .
So maybe THEY'RE Satanic .
SURPRISE !!
Wake up folks .
Everyday is going to be Halloween now for quite a while .
Until we all settle our minds , fall in love with truth , and learn to see what we 're looking at , and talk straight about it .
This is what loving God is about .
It 's not about wearing a ridiculous costume , doing everybody 's kids , and throwing up a smokescreen of mumbo- jumbo About God .
It 's about SERVING God by exposing and shutting down organized evil .
Sorry , guys .
I know cowardice seems easier .
' Seems ' being operative ...
It 's time to wake up .
Posted by elScotto on 2010-04-09 20:13:04 Religion exploits a sad neurological flaw in most humans .
These simple folks selectively switch off their capacity for reason , intelligence , and critical thinking , and thus surrender their human dignity , and indeed their very sanity - all to feel special and protected by God , the universe 's superhero , cape and all .
Be kind to religious people , as they are our neighbors and relatives .
But if you feel like having a little fun with them , go ahead and debate the specifics of human , animal , and planetary origins .
Calmly pin them down to the facts .
For desert , you can ask them where people of other faiths end up when they die .
What about babies of Islamics who die .
Since they claim to know so much about how things started , right down to the silliest details and anecdotes , do n't let them give you the " I do n't know " nonsense .
Have fun , but have a heart !

Interviewed for a television programme in 2006 , canon lawyer Thomas Doyle described the tight secrecy demanded for the procedure as " an explicit written policy to cover up cases of child sexual abuse by the clergy , to punish those who would call attention to these crimes by churchmen " . [ 15 ]
However , in the study of the instruction that he revised less than two years later he stated :
From Wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis
" According to the 1922 and 1962 documents , accusers and witnesses are bound by the secrecy obligation during and after the process but certainly not prior to the initiation of the process .
There is no basis to assume that the Holy See envisioned this process to be a substitute for any secular legal process , criminal or civil .
It is also incorrect to assume , as some have unfortunately done , that these two Vatican documents are proof of a conspiracy to hide sexually abusive priests or to prevent the disclosure of sexual crimes committed by clerics to secular authorities . " [ 16 ]
He also remarked : " To fully understand the overriding concern for secrecy one must also understand the traditional canonical concept known as the ' Privilege of the Forum ' privilegium fori which has its roots in medieval Canon Law .
Basically this is a traditional privilege claimed by the institutional church whereby clerics accused of crimes were tried before ecclesiastical courts and not brought before civil or secular courts .
Although this privilege is anachronistic in contemporary society , the attitude or mentality which holds clerics accountable only to the institutional church authorities is still active .
This does not mean that the official Church believes that clerics accused of crimes should not to be held accountable .
It means that during certain periods in history the Church has believed that it alone should have the right to subject accused clerics to a judicial process . " [ 17 ]
John L. Allen , Jr. has said the secrecy was aimed rather at the protection of all involved , the accused , the victim / denouncer and the witnesses , before the verdict was passed , and for free finding of facts . [ 18 ] .... superior to what ?
Posted by Marco on 2013-02-18 21:09:34
There is no superior creed or a proper understanding of the word from heaven should n't lead us to believe that this or that doctrine is better or worse .
The only norm or measurement to establish a substantial - valid - comparison is through the heavenly word ... and that is : it is true or is not .
It is the word of the eternal or it is not .
if you can't understand this principal is because you belong to the world and your opinion would be a worldly opinion .
I f you have been born of the Spirit , you would know that ........................ The fact that many different people and Christians or non-christians disagree does n't invalid the word of our father ; it only talks of the relativity of those people and those institutions .
Our only hope is at the very individual and personal level in recognizing our duty to read , listen and apprehend the word of God with prayer and not leaving that responsibility to no institution , creed or denomination .
THE WORD OF GOD IS OUR ONLY HOPE for truth , life and salvation .

Far from forgiveness , God has other plans for Benny and his pals .
The devil does not share his toys .
Benny 's sins will not be cleansed by the blood of Christ .
Benny knew he was showing contempt for that which is sacred and good .
So did the cardinals who put him in as pope .

DIGG THIS
In 1958 , the New Left sociologist C. Wright Mills made a seminal contribution to political science in his book The Causes of World War Three by introducing the concept of “ crackpot realism . ”
He applied the notion specifically to the intellectual outlook of top government officials , especially the ones known as the “ serious people , ” who have proven their capacity for dealing with important practical affairs by , say , managing a giant corporation , such as Halliburton or G. D. Searle , or a huge educational institution , such as Texas A&M University or the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business .
Mills ’s key insight was that although such people have indeed been movers and shakers , they have moved and shaken within such a constricted milieu of experience and training that in most respects they are fools .
Despite having developed supreme confidence in their own judgment and a corresponding contempt for other people ’s views , they are astonishingly ignorant of many workaday aspects of the world and bewildered in the face of unexpected difficulties .
As government leaders responsible for matters of war and peace , they have a tendency to paint themselves into corners of their own making and , then , seeing no way out , to conclude that their only escape lies in dropping bombs on somebody .
As Mills observed , “ instead of the unknown fear , the anxiety without end , some men of the higher circles prefer the simplification of known catastrophe . ”
Crackpot realists never learn anything , even when the lessons are cuffing them roughly about the head and shoulders .
They continue to pile on more of the same actions that got them into trouble in the first place , expecting to be seen as Churchillian heroes for staying the idiotic course they have set .
They keep spinning the bad news , year after year after year , wearing out entire battalions of press officers , until they finally escape from the morass by leaving office .
Afterward , they heap blame on their successors for “ losing China ” or “ cutting and running . ”
Although the crackpot realists are neither wise nor honest , they are politically shrewd and personally vicious .
When their malfeasances are exposed , they toss subordinates to the wolves and prepare the ground for their own pardons , understanding that the political winds may shift sharply against them later on .
They are not squeamish : they digest mass murder as easily as they consume their eggs and toast , and they do not lose sleep by agonizing over the cannon fodder they sacrifice in the service of their own aggrandizement .
Other people ’s children go to war ; theirs go to Harvard and Yale .
Being busy people , they cannot waste time on pity , except when a photo op requires its feigned expression .
Imperialism appeals to them : if controlling the economic heights at home is good , controlling them throughout the entire world is better .
Once ExxonMobil , Shell , Citigroup , J. P. Morgan Chase , Bank of America , Lockheed Martin , Boeing , Halliburton , and Bechtel have made their multinational arrangements , everything else will fall into place nicely .
If it does n’t , because some uppity mullah or tin-pot dictator creates a snag , the U.S. Marines are always available , in the immortal words of the American Enterprise Institute ’s Michael Ledeen , “ to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall , just to show the world we mean business . "
Lest you suspect that I am hyperventilating , I suggest that you proceed immediately to Max Boot ’s November 14 article in the New York Times , “ Send the State Department to War . ” I can not make up such stuff ; you simply have to read it for yourself to believe it .
Amid a plethora of harebrained proposals , Boot recommends a huge personnel increase at the U.S. Agency for International Development .
And how does he pitch this wacky idea ?
“ If we expand its ranks , it could become our lead nation - building agency , sort of a global FEMA , marshaling the kind of resources that have been lacking in Iraq and Afghanistan . ”
Just imagine : “ sort of a global FEMA . ”
If nothing else , we now know why Boot has not landed a job on Madison Avenue .
Ordinarily , it is juvenile simply to dismiss someone whose views we abhor as a nincompoop , but in this case , what alternative does Boot provide us ?
He not only wants to pump up the USAID ’s ranks for global nation - building , a task at which the agency has obviously already failed , despite its decades of trying and the hundreds of billions of dollars it has dropped down nearly every rat hole in the Third World , but he also advises that USAID take on a legion of experts who will stand ready to be summoned at a moment ’s notice , “ like military reservists , ” to “ bring expertise in municipal administration , sewage treatment , banking , electricity generation , and countless other disciplines needed to rebuild a war - torn country . ”
It seems never to occur to these towering geniuses that a better idea might be not bombing the country ’s infrastructure to smithereens in the first place .
Next in line come the “ experienced police officers who can train local counterparts . ”
Boot evidently imagines that Sergeant O’Malley can teach Hamid how to keep the peace in the festering slums of Sadar City .
Does that idea have any basis in fact or logic ?
He also senses a crying need for a “ federal constabulary force — a uniformed counterpart to the F.B.I. that , like the Italian carabinieri , could be deployed abroad ” — along with “ a deployable corps of lawyers , judges and prison guards who could set up functioning legal and penal systems abroad . ”
There ’s more , but I have n’t the heart to describe these ravings any further .
Has anyone ever combined a more preposterously unrealistic set of proposals with such boundless moral arrogance , not to mention the monumental ignorance of how the world works ?
Does
Boot have any idea how people develop effective means of community policing , a viable criminal - justice system , or a physical infrastructure for providing reliable water supply , sewerage , and electrical power generation and distribution ?
Does he imagine that one simply hauls in experts from Dubuque and Dallas , sets them down in Basra , and — shazam ! — everything clicks into place and works like a diamond - jeweled watch thereafter .
Has he ever considered , for example , that keeping the electrical supply system in working order may be impossible when various factions insist on blowing up the power lines and other equipment that serve the neighbors they despise on religious grounds ?
Might Kirkuk ’s optimal type of municipal administration differ in some important ways from Denver ’s , and do American “ experts ” have any concrete idea what the critical differences are ?
Is it plausible that a society can be substantially “ reconstructed ” in any useful way by outsiders who know nothing about its history and customs and who cannot speak or understand its language ?
If Boot were an anonymous nutcase posting his screeds on a neocon Web site , we might well ignore his huffing and puffing .
He is , however , someone who moves in the highest circles .
Formerly an editor at the Wall Street Journal , he is currently a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , a prominent fortress of the Establishment .
His books touting war and imperialism have received wide notice , and perhaps someone has even read them .
He is , in fact , a perfect example of the crackpot realists who constitute our ruling class .
Formerly known as “ the best and the brightest , ” before that particular appellation lost its luster in the Vietnam debacle , these people are now hard at work dishing out death and destruction wherever they turn their attention in the wider world .
Ordinary people hang on their pronunciamentos as if they spoke with the wisdom of Solomon , but the people need to get over their awe .
Maybe these Übermenschen can run a big corporation , a major newspaper , or a federal government department , but they cannot run the world , except in the limited sense that they can mistreat a great number of people in various countries in order to line their pockets , gratify their vanities , and fulfill their savage fantasies .
For all the rest of us , however , they produce nothing but wreckage and grief .
Most of all , the crackpot realists are frauds .
We ordinary people , the great multitude on the bottom rungs of the power ladder , need to understand more clearly that when we look up at the self - anointed “ deciders ” who have the cosmic effrontery to presume themselves fit to rule us , we are looking up at fools .
The Best of Robert Higgs
Online purchases are always good to go with and for buyers in the New Zealand we all have to make sure that we are going to purchase things from trusted online sellers .
The online brands that are selling the high quality branded products and are offering the household appliances for quite some time , may give better things than others .
The sellers offering the best quality products always try to offer the support and information that the byers may be looking for .
So we can estimate which of the things that matter the most and will help in determine which options are the best .
For better choices we can see that when buying the bench top oven or simply the dryers the top brands offer the features enlisted about the products always help .
The personal choices , features and understanding of the things that are important work to offer the better things people would need .
The overall brand , the features , the manufacturer warranty given for the customers who are looking for higher quality robot vacuum cleaner and other such appliances will always help in making the right choices .
The availability of the wide range of products to compare with also help in making thing better and easier to choose form so that lesser mistakes are there and better things are chosen .
For example , for buying dryer and different types fridges or the freezers we can simply compare the size , the features and the overall capacity that is enough for use .
The quality of the machine , the reliability of the functions and everything that is related to the products that we want to buy online make it easier so that we can simply choose the one we need .
Personal choices like the kind of features that the buyer is looking for and the capacity they need in the washer dryer or the benchtop oven that they are looking for .
In addition to that the guaranteed and proven performance background also helps in making the choice better and pick the right things expecting that the new one will work better and will get the support when needed .
For the things like the gas cooktops or just a simple electric or dual cooktop you may also look for the fix size and the adjustability of the fixtures in a way that will not lead to much hassles and would be easy to get started with .
As part of it continuing bid to beef up its " strategic communications " capabilities , the U.S. government has tried many things in Iraq , including , it turns out , distributing comic books .
The military recently put out a solicitation for " twelve ( 12 ) issues of 6th Brigade Comic Book series " which is designed " to highlight the professionalism of the Iraqi Special Operations Forces ( ISOF ) and to enhance the public perception of the Iraqi Security Forces ( ISF ) as a capable , well - trained , and professional fighting force IAW Information Operations Objectives ... "
This apparently is n't a new thing .
Last year , a published announcement said a sole source contract for 6th Brigade Comic Book went to the Lincoln Group , the private contractor that gained notoriety for paying to place favorable press coverage in Iraqi newspapers .
According to the website psywarrior.com :
The first comic books were created as collaborative effort with the US Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg , which did the initial character and plot development .
They are based on the security forces , both military and police , in the Middle East .
The initiative for the comic - book project came from the US Department of Defense 's Central Command , which is responsible for US security interests in 25 Middle Eastern and Arab nations .
It is hoped that the comics will help engender respect among children for the national police force and the new Iraqi Army .
A special DANGER ROOM prize goes to the first reader who can get me a copy of one .
UPDATE : Noah here .
I do n't have the prize - winning comic in hand , just yet .
Nor am I sure what prize Sharon has in mind .
But I would like to note that the U.S. is trying this same comic book trick in the Philippines .
And that our buddies at IraqSlogger have screen grabs of two different issues in the Lincoln Group comic book series .
Male sex workers or gigolos comprise a shadowy group of people in India .
The BBC's Soutik Biswas meets a group of gigolos in the eastern city of Calcutta .
Gigolos in India are bonding and joining HIV prevention groups
What is common between a draughtsman , an accounting clerk , a shop assistant and a school dropout ?
Nothing much apart from the fact that the four men come from middle - class families in India and - barring the drop out - quit humdrum jobs to start selling sex to women in the crowded eastern city of Calcutta .
Dibakar , Samrat , Pallab and Goutam have also come together to bond in a group called Anandam that includes gays , lesbians , transgender groups and bisexuals to push HIV prevention programmes .
They are also stepping out of their shadowy world to talk about their lives and problems in a society where very little is known about them , talking about sex remains a taboo , and homosexuality and soliciting sex is outlawed .
High risk
Most female sex workers in India walk the streets or work out of thriving , grubby red light districts .
Male sex workers usually cruise downtown streets in main cities , work in shady massage parlours and trawl internet chatrooms for clients .
There are several thousand of them in the big cities and their numbers are growing as the mobile phone and the internet have made business easier for them .
They are hardly spoken about in HIV prevention programmes , though they comprise one of the most high - risk groups in the country .
The clients are very demanding these days
Pallab
" Nobody really has any idea of what we do , and the problems we face .
In India , the gigolo is usually made fun of .
Some of my friends tell me , ' what an enviable life you live ! ' , " says Samrat , a earnest looking thirty something man and a science graduate .
Most of gigolos in India tell stories of hailing from middle or lower middle - class backgrounds and getting introduced to the world of selling sex through friends , parties , and working in seedy massage parlours that have sprung up all over the country .
They have now begun putting adverts in newspaper classified columns and ' penpal ' magazines , hawking themselves openly as male escorts and ' friends ' .
They say that they not only meet their clients for paid sex charging upwards for 1,000 rupees ( $ 25 ) for an hour , but also get their clients to top up their prepaid mobile phone cards and pay for their internet connections for phone and cyber sex .
They also offer some insight into the changing sexual mores of a growing number of Indian women who are ready to spend money on buying sex in a traditionally conservative society .
It is hardly a easy job to do - in the absence of male brothels , gigolos like Samrat cruise after dusk for prospective clients , mainly upper or middle - class and rich women who usually drive in their cars with dark tinted windows .
" It is not all fun and games as people think .
Just as female sex workers face violence and get cheated , we face such situations from time to time too , " says the son of a bank worker , who joined the sex trade after a short stint as an employee with a multi-national pharmaceutical firm in the capital , Delhi .
" I have often not been paid by clients , and when I have protested , they have threatened me with telling the police that I tried to rape them .
And there are clients who love to stub out burning cigarettes on our bodies .
These days I have begun to charge for a cigarette burn - 500 rupees ( $ 11 ) per stub , " he says .
Sudeep says it is easier to get clients these days
Over the years , the profile of women buying sex in India has also changed , Samrat and his friends say .
" Even four years ago , my clientele was what you would call ' high class ' - wives of businessmen , executives , bureaucrats , traders .
Now there are middle - class women calling us , " says Samrat .
Also , says Sudeep Chakraborty , 31 , an accountancy graduate , it is no longer difficult to get in touch with clients .
" Women who seek us out are no longer bashful .
They are as professional as men seeking female sex workers , " he says .
Sudeep says he met his first client at a friend 's party .
The lonely wife of a businessman , " as she described herself " , took him aside and poured out her heart to him .
Then , the two began going out for dates .
' Not thriving '
" She used to pay for my company , and later for the sex .
She would give me pocket money .
With her , I was making 800 rupees every time we met , so I thought why do n't I join the trade , " he says .
Younger men like Goutam , Pallab and Aditya , who all dropped out of school and began working in massage parlours before picking up the trade , say the clientele is not as thriving as some make it out to be .
And for that reason , they say , many of them have to sleep with men to keep their home fires burning .
" Women can be very demanding .
Sometimes they shock my middle - class upbringing with their demands .
When we do n't get women , we have to sleep with men .
It 's not fun and games at all , " says Pallab .

Twas the night before Christmas , when all through the White House
Not a creature was stirring , not even my spouse ,
The stockings were hung up by the chimney with care ,
And the shredders were humming in the chilly night air
Our spinners and fixers all snug in their beds
While visions of water boarding danced in their heads .
Now Laura in ' kerchief , and me in a nightcap ,
Had settled our brains for a long winter 's nap .
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter ,
Agents sprang from their bunks to see what was the matter .
Away to the window they flew with guns pointed ,
Tore open the shutters and were not disappointed .
The moon on the breast of the new - fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to a bloodbath below .
When , what to our wondering eyes did unfold ,
A nativity play of events rarely told .
First the old torturer , so lively and quick ,
Vice President Cheney dressed up as St Nick .
More rapid than eagles his helpers they came ,
Carrying gags , hot pokers , sundry handtools of pain .
A replica dungeon sprang up on the grass ,
Writhing with suspects , sticks up their ass .
Twas a moving rendition of the CIA 's Mission
A sacred tableau : The American Inquisition !
Habeas corpus we burned at the stake ,
Air strikes on Arabs are ducks on a plate .
Five million orphans adrift in Iraq
But the oil still flows , the plan is on track .
And then , in a twinkling , it was heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof ,
As three men on camels leapt into the garden ;
One was none other than Osama bin Laden .
" Welcome my brother " came Dick 's merry greeting ,
" I know we are soul mates and your visit is fleeting " .
The pair danced a jig and bowed to the crowd
Sweet Laura asked , " Should this be allowed " ?
Now Cheney is sweating from his head to his foot ,
And his fat face is tarnished with ashes and soot .
Electrodes and thumb screws he 's flung on his back ,
And he looks like a psychopath , poised to attack .
But a wink of his eye and a twist of his head ,
Assured all those present they had nothing to dread .
We 've erased all evidence , he said with delight ,
While our tortures continue , late into the night .
The stump of an infant he held tight in his teeth ,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath .
And I heard him exclaim , 'ere he drove out of sight ,
" Happy Christmas to all , and to all a good - night ! "
Richard Neville
BAGHDAD
Male gynaecologists are being targeted by Islamic extremists in Iraq as they are accused of invading the privacy of women .
Women ’s NGOs have raised concerns as there are few women gynaecologists in the country and their male counterparts are scared to continue working .
“ Because of the extremists ’ religious views , doctors are scared to continue with their work and the number of women gynaecologists is very low and cannot meet the demand , ” said Mayada Zuhair , spokeswoman for the Women ’ Rights Association ( WRA ) .
“ Extremists say that [ male ] doctors are not allowed to see the private parts of women and two male doctors were reportedly killed last week after leaving their clinics .
A message was left near their bodies saying that was the end for any doctor who insists in invading the privacy of Muslim women , ” Mayada added .
An Iraqi Medical Association ( IMA ) spokesman , Walid Rafi , told IRIN it knew of at least 22 male gynaecologists who had been sent threatening letters .
Extremists say that [ male ] doctors are not allowed to see the private parts of women and two male doctors were reportedly killed last week after leaving their clinics .
“ In one case the extremists tried to carry out their threat .
They kidnapped the son of a doctor and only released him after the doctor had closed his clinic in Karada district , in Baghdad , ” Rafi said .
“ We are worried about women ’s health in this country .
Few of them have access to good medical care and now with the fear of male gynaecologists , few remain in the job and this could have a serious impact in the coming months . ”
Rafi added that aggression against doctors who treat women had also been reported in the northern provinces .
“ We do n’t know the exact number of doctors who have been killed but we can confirm that four doctors were killed in the north for refusing to circumcise young girls . ”
Case in point
Yasser Issam , a gynaecologist in Baghdad , said that since 20 October there had been two attempts on his life and he had received a letter asking him to stop treating women in his clinic as he was offending the privacy of Muslim women .
“ I did n’t have a choice .
I preferred to leave my job altogether with two other colleagues who were in the same situation .
We left the clinic in the hands of two female colleagues who later said they could not cope with the demand and have started to turn down patients , ” Issam said .
The Ministry of Health has said it is investigating the cases and has asked the Ministry of Interior to protect doctors and nurses countrywide .
Heath services in Iraq have been seriously undermined by the shortage of doctors .
According to the IMA , at least 75 percent of doctors , pharmacists and nurses have left their jobs at universities , clinics and hospitals .
Of these , at least 55 percent have fled abroad .
“ There are days when we find more than 80 patients per doctor in our hospital , an average of 170 daily .
All of them are divided among the two women gynaecologists who are left in our clinic , ” said Afaf Abdul - Qahar , a gynaecologist at Karada Maternity Centre , in the capital .

A sex tape featuring actress Vivica A . Fox has reportedly been leaked .
The tape was recorded on a cell phone by one of Fox 's companions , and was then emailed out to several of his friends .
A copy was also sent to Fox , who immediately turned it over to the police .
We 're not yet sure how many copies have been circulated , and they have yet to show up on the internet .
Fox is an American actress best known for films including Independence Day and Kill Bill .
She was married to singer Chris Harvest in 1998 , and they later divorced in 2002 .
In 2003 she began dating rapper 50 Cent .
The sanctions target the 125,000 - strong Iranian revolutionary guard ( IRG ) , one of the best - resourced parts of the country 's military , with its own tanks and planes .
It also owns hotels , oil companies and other businesses .
The Bush administration went a step further with the IRG 's elite Quds division , responsible for covert actions abroad , labelling it a terrorist organisation , the first time a state 's military has been put on America 's terrorist list .
The Quds force , numbering about 15,000 , is alleged by the US to be involved with Lebanon 's Hizbullah and groups elsewhere in the Middle East .
Making the announcement at a press conference , the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said the punitive moves were intended " to confront the threatening behaviour of the Iranians " .
The sanctions and other steps would " increase the costs to Iran of its irresponsible behaviour " .
The administration also imposed sanctions on three Iranian state - owned banks : Bank Melli and Mellat , for alleged arms proliferation , and Bank Saderat , which was labelled " a terrorist financier " .
In addition to the IRG and the banks , eight individuals and several other companies are covered by the sanctions .
The US decision to act unilaterally reflects White House frustration at the refusal of Russia and China to support tough economic sanctions against Tehran in the UN security council .
The Russian president , Vladimir Putin , underscored the divisions in the international community yesterday , when he criticised the sanctions move , saying it would make a negotiated settlement harder to achieve .
" Why worsen the situation by threatening sanctions and bring it to a dead end ? " he said .
" It 's not the best way to resolve the situation by running around like a madman with a razor blade in his hand . "
In Tehran , the revolutionary guards ' commander , General Mohammad Ali Jafari , claimed that the sanctions would have little impact : " They have applied all their efforts to reduce the efficiency of this revolutionary body .
Now as always , the corps is ready to defend the ideals of the revolution more than ever before . "
The sanctions package , combined with the sending of a second US carrier group to the Gulf earlier this year , is aimed primarily at containing Iran , which has been expanding its influence in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
They are also intended to force Tehran to stop its alleged attempt to develop a nuclear bomb and end its alleged supply of weapons to Iraqi militia groups .
Ms Rice , who has had to withstand pressure from within the Bush administration for military action , insisted she remained committed to the diplomatic route .
But she added : " Unfortunately the Iranian government continues to spurn our offer of open negotiations , instead threatening peace and security by pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon , building dangerous ballistic missiles , supporting Shia militants in Iraq and terrorists in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories , and denying the existence of a fellow member of the United Nations , threatening to wipe Israel off the map . "
President George Bush has said repeatedly that a military strike is an option .
As part of a multi-billion - dollar request for more military spending earlier this week , the Pentagon asked for $ 88 m to develop the Massive Ordnance Penetrator , a huge bunker - busting bomb , for its Stealth bombers .
The Bush administration said the bomb was needed " in response to an urgent operational need for theatre commanders " .
Democratic members of Congress questioned whether the weapon was intended for use against Iran , whose nuclear facilities are largely hidden underground .
Jim Moran , a Democratic member of the House of Representatives ' defence spending committee , said : " My assumption is that it is Iran , because you would n't use them in Iraq , and I do n't know where you would use them in Afghanistan , it does n't have any weapons facilities underground that we know of . "
The immediate impact of the sanctions announcement will be felt in the boardrooms of banks and companies in Britain and elsewhere in Europe .
Any business continuing to trade with Iran risks US reprisals .
The sanctions make it illegal for any US citizen to knowingly provide material support or resources to the Quds division .
As the US has had few links with Iran since 1979 , this is mainly academic .
The impact will be felt by non-American companies that have business interests in both the US and Iran .
The US treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , who accompanied Ms Rice at the press conference , said , " It is increasingly likely that if you are doing business with Iran , you are doing business [ with the Iranian revolutionary guard corps ] .
It 's simply not worth the risk . "
The British and other European governments are discussing whether also to designate the Quds division a terrorist organisation , though the legal definition and the process of designating groups as terrorist is different from that in the US .
Samak Sundaravej 's PPP is expected to win but not outright
But emerging partial results suggest the People Power Party ( PPP ) will fall short of an outright majority , and a coalition government is likely .
The pattern may change again , given that early results tend to come in from urban areas where the PPP is weaker .
It is the first election since the 2006 coup that overthrew Mr Thaksin .
Instability fears
Three - quarters of the ballots have been counted nationwide but although the exit polls point to a PPP win , they vary widely on the number of seats the party is expected to take .
Full unofficial results are expected to be announced at about midnight ( 1700 GMT ) .
Election monitors say that voting has mostly proceeded smoothly and been well - organised , despite complaints of vote - buying and other irregularities .
POST - COUP TIMELINE
September 2006 : Coup overthrows Thaksin Shinawatra October 2006 : Retired General Surayud Chulanont is appointed interim leader May 2007 : Court bans Mr Thaksin from politics for five years , and dissolves his party August 2007 : Voters approve a new constitution 23 December 2007 : Election held
Key election figures Thailand 's turbulent year Profile : Thaksin Shinawatra

The BBC's Jonathan Head says a PPP win would be a setback to the military , which has tried to counter Mr Thaksin 's allies .
Our correspondent says that if the PPP has not won an outright majority , there will be considerable pressure on middle - ranking parties to form a coalition with the PPP 's main rival , the Democrats .
But he says this could lead to further instability as a multi-party government could well prove weak and short - lived .
Mr Thaksin himself has been in exile since the coup , and he and his Thai Rak Thai party were banned from politics by the military government .
But his allies have resurfaced under the PPP banner , and analysts say they have benefited from Mr Thaksin 's populist appeal , especially in the countryside .
One voter , Roongchai , told the BBC that he liked Thaksin because he was " brave enough to change things " .
" He might have made mistakes , but overall he brought positive change . "
Return from exile ?

" It shows that the coup one - and - a - half years ago has not benefited the country or anyone , " he told the AFP news agency .
The PPP 's right - wing leader Samak Sundaravej , 72 , says he expects Mr Thaksin to return to Thailand from self - imposed exile in the UK if PPP wins an outright majority .
If he does return to the Thailand , Mr Thaksin will have to answer a number of corruption charges levelled against him in the courts .
Steven Spielberg is currently working on Indiana Jones 4
Movie publication Variety reports that a three feature deal has been struck , with the pair directing one each and the third still to be decided .
Jackson 's special effects team Weta Digital will use 3 - D animation to bring the junior reporter to life .
The character was created by Herge , aka Belgian artist Georges Remi , in 1929 .
Weta has already produced a 20 - minute test reel showing how the finished films might look , Variety said .
' Distinctive look '
Spielberg told the publication : " Herge 's characters have been reborn as living beings , expressing emotion and a soul which goes far beyond anything we 've seen to date with computer animated characters .
Tintin books are still bestsellers
It is reported that the stories , detailing the adventures of the reporter , his dog Snowy and best friend Captain Haddock , will be taken from the 23 albums Herge published between 1929 and 1976 .
The series is estimated to have sold 200 million copies and been translated into over 50 languages .
Spielberg is a longstanding fan and has been looking to make a film version of the books for 25 years .
Both directors will become available by the end of the year after they have finished working on Lovely Bones and Indiana Jones 4 .
The deal comes after Jackson agreed to direct Lovely Bones , based on Alice Sebold 's book , with Spielberg 's DreamWorks studio .

About Owls
Most Owls are active at dusk and dawn , spending the daytime at a quiet , inconspicuous roost .
They can be found roosting singly or in pairs or family groups , but may form flocks outside of the breeding season ( A group of Owls is called a parliament ) .

An Owl 's daily activity begins with preening , stretching , yawning and combing its head with its claws .
The plumage is often ruffled up , and claws and toes are cleaned by nibbling with the beak .
The Owl will then leave its roost , sometimes giving a call ( especially in breeding season ) .
Owls have a very expressive body language .
Many species will bob and weave their head , as if curious about something - this is in fact to further improve their three - dimensional concept of what they are viewing .

When relaxed , the plumage is loose and fluffy .
If an owl becomes alarmed , it will become slim , its feathers pulled in tightly to the body , and ear - tufts , if any , will stand straight up .
A pygmy Owl will cock its tail and flick it from side to side when excited or alarmed .
Little owls bob their body up and down when alert .
When protecting young or defending itself , an Owl may assume a " threat " or defensive posture , with feathers ruffled to increase apparent size .
The head may be lowered , and wings spread out and pointing down .
Some species become quite aggressive when nesting , and have been known to attack humans .

Owls will bathe in shallow water , and also in rain .
Calls :
Owls have a very wide range of vocalisations , ranging from the hoots so often associated with Owls , to whistles , screeches , screams , purrs , snorts , chitters and hisses .
Hooting is often territorial , and is also associated with courting , the male usually having the lower pitched Hoot .
It should be noted that not all owl species Hoot .
Owls can also make clicking noises with their tongues , often as part of a threat display .
They may also clap their wings in flight as part of a mating display .
Great Horned Owls calling © Doug Van Gausig
Mobbing : Because
Owls are predators , they are feared by many birds .
For this reason , they are often attacked or harassed by groups of smaller birds .
This is not limited to one species , as once the attack begins , many different birds will join in .
Interestingly , the Owl rarely responds to the harassment , and it is just as rare for the Owl to be injured in any way !
The mobbing may succeed in forcing the Owl to move on to a different area .
The retreating Owl is often pursued by the mob .
Migration : Owls are generally resident birds .
Some Northern populations of certain species may escape harsh winters by moving south .
Social Learning Strategies Tournament
€ 10,000 prize
Suppose you find yourself in an unfamiliar environment where you do n't know how to get food , avoid predators , or travel from A to B .
Would you invest time working out what to do on your own , or observe other individuals and copy them ?
If you copy , who would you copy ?
The first individual you see ?
The most common behaviour ?
Do you always copy , or do so selectively ?
What would you do ?
These questions lie at the centre of a scientific challenge with important implications for the evolution of learning and culture :
What is the best way to learn in a complex , changing world ?
We are looking for the best answer to this question by organizing an international tournament , open to everyone .
Entries consist of a set of rules specifying how and when to learn .
All of the entered rules are being pitted against each other in a computer simulation and the winner will be awarded a 10,000 euro prize .
THE TOURNAMENT IS NOW COMPLETE AND WE HAVE A WINNER !
Click here for detailed information on the results of the tournament .
We also have a Facebook page with FAQs and other details .
" This tournament is a wonderful opportunity to advance our understanding of the evolution of social learning , and I was glad to have been able to give advice about the rules .
It has my wholehearted support and I hope that as many people as possible will have a go . "
Robert Axelrod , University of Michigan
Background
' Social learning ' - learning from others - is observed in many species , and is particularly important for humans , as it is underlies our capacity for tradition and culture .
Social learning can be a good way for individuals to get information about their environment .
However , blindly copying is very unlikely to be useful because information may be wrong , and can become outdated .
Therefore , we expect individuals to use social learning on a selective basis by employing ' social learning strategies ' - rules about when and whom to copy .
But which strategies perform best ?
Which win out in an evolutionary struggle ?
We are organising a computer - based tournament that we hope will generate some interesting answers , as well as stimulate research in this area .
We invite individuals or groups to submit strategies which will then be pitted against each other in a series of evolutionary computer simulations .
We aim to solicit submissions from a wide range of disciplines , including economics , psychology and behavioural ecology , as well as from people outside academia .
The tournament is being overseen by a committee of distinguished scientists with much pertinent experience :
The committee has been extensively involved in designing the tournament , and we are also very grateful to Robert Axelrod of the University of Michigan for providing important advice and support with regard to the tournament design .
The tournament is now closed for entries .

Ms. DaSilva , 26 , thinks of herself as adventurous , but not so brash that she is about to cross a line .
Dressing for a wedding as if it were an after - party is accepted among her family and friends .
“ For my generation , looking like a virgin when you marry is completely unappealing , boring even , ” she said .
“ Who cares about that part anymore ? ”
Ms. DaSilva is typical of a growing number of brides flouting convention by flaunting their curves .
More vamp than virgin , many are selecting gowns that bare a generous expanse of cleavage , midsection , lower back or thigh , temptress styles that may be better suited to a gala or boudoir than to a church or ballroom .
“ Brides today absolutely want to look sexy and glamorous , ” said Mara Urshel , an owner and the president of Kleinfeld , the venerable Manhattan bridal salon .
In recent months , the store has seen a spike in demand for plunging necklines and negligee looks , one that has only intensified since the spring bridal collections began arriving in stores .
For brides shopping now for gowns to wear at summer or early fall weddings , “ there is a lot of freedom of choice , and these girls exercise every bit of it , ” Ms. Urshel said .
Determined to look torrid on their wedding day , they are picking dresses modeled , say , on the one worn by Christina Aguilera , who was married in 2005 in a gown with a plummeting neckline and ruffled fishtail hem .
Or maybe the hope is to emulate Sarah Jessica Parker , who , in the forthcoming film version of “ Sex and the City , ” spills out of the front of her wedding dress .
“ Young women increasingly look to the red carpet for style ideas , ” said Millie Martini Bratten , the editor in chief of Brides magazine .
“ They are very aware of how they look , ” she added .
“ They diet , they work out .
And when they marry , they want to be the celebrity of their own event . ”

T for 90 billion yen ( $ 835 million ) , in their latest move to focus on their core businesses .
The equipment will be used by their semiconductor joint venture that will make high - performance Cell chips and RSX graphic chips , both used in Sony ’s PlayStation 3 game console , as well as other microchips that go into Toshiba products .
The venture will be established on April 1 .
Sony , which is focusing on image sensor chips for digital cameras and pulling away from heavy investments for cutting - edge chip production equipment , said in October it would sell production facilities for making key microchips used in the PS3 to Toshiba , but the price has been unavailable .
The announcement on the selling price comes on the heels of Toshiba ’s decision on Tuesday to abandon its HD DVD high - definition DVD format , ending a prolonged battle with the Sony - led Blu-ray camp .
Toshiba twinned the HD DVD exit with an announcement that it and partner SanDisk Corp SNDK .

Iraq suicide attacks back on the rise , even as overall violence dips Adam Doster
Published : Saturday December 29 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Despite overall violence in Iraq dropping to levels not seen consistently since the summer of 2005 , suicide bombings appear to be rising again , according to figures released today by General David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq .
Suicide attacks using explosive vests and car bombs started to inch back up during the last two months of 2007 .
For example , on Christmas Day , the Los Angeles Times reports that at least 24 people were killed and as many as 100 injured in two separate bombings .
But all is not lost .
General Petraeus told reporters that the number of high - profile bombings , a signature of Sunni Arab insurgents , has dropped 60 percent from a peak of more than 120 this past March , with the most visible drop in remotely detonated car bombs .
Given the countrys fragile nature , commanders have been careful about making overly optimistic predictions ,  citing that insurgents are capable of staging major attacks at any time .
" Progress is of course tenuous ,  says Petraeus , and it could be reversed . "
The Army contends that the drop in violence broadly can be credited to a number of factors : a 28,500 - U.S. troop buildup , a cease - fire implemented by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr , the choice of tens of thousands of Sunni tribesmen to fight the extremists they once backed , and new assistance from Iraq 's neighbors -- especially Syria -- to reduce the flow of foreign fighters into the war - torn country .
Some Iraqis , encouraged by the slowing violence , have started returning to their once - abandoned homes .
But Petraeus warned that until a strategy was created to deal with cases in which peoples homes had been taken over by others or ruined , the relocation would be complicated .
" These are not situations we can resolve , " he said of U.S. - led forces .
" I think this is just going to remain a very , very tough issue for some time , and it's one that Iraqis , as the security situation continues to improve , are going to have to come to grips with more and more . "

Built St. Louis > > East St. Louis > >
We 're standing almost beneath the Gateway Arch .
Can you spot East St. Louis ?
Do n't be surprised if you can't .
The city 's downtown is a long way from the St. Louis riverfront ... physically and metaphorically .
Only the 13 story Spivey Building is clearly visible from the Missouri side ( look just to the right of the Casino Queen 's white , yellow and red sign . )
Most St. Louis residents and visitors see it either from here , or zipping past it at 70 miles per hour on the way to the Illinois suburbs -- in other words , not at all .
It 's not just a literal statement .
Few cities in America have suffered like East St. Louis has over the last several decades .
The city 's race riots of 1917 , sparked by white fear of blacks migrating into the city from the south and widespread racial prejudice on both sides , are legendary .
The city was long cheated out of tax revenue by massive factories that incorporated themselves as separate towns .
White flight and job loss devastated the town from the 1950s onward .
From a peak population of 90,000 in 1960 the city has dwindled to 36,000 today .
But the numbers tell only part of the story .
Far more telling are the sights of the city 's streets themselves .
One color dominates in East St. Louis : green .
The city has acquired a notion of ultimate danger , a reputation the supreme king of Places You Should n't Go .
And while violent crime remains a common problem , the surprising fact is ... most of the city is empty .
So many lots have been vacated , so much land stands empty where once there were homes or factories , so many abandoned houses are being overtaken by trees and weeds , that the city in many places appears not so much an urban landscape as some ancient Aztec ruin , lost in a jungle .
In many places , you 're unlikely to even see anybody on the streets .
This landscape is the result of white flight , of disinvestment , of a loss of tax base , of a city for years could barely afford even the most basic of services , of a people struggling to get by .
I can't claim to tell or know the whole story ; my purpose is to document what survives today .
More telling still are the stories I hear from site visitors , people who grew up in East St. Louis in the 1950s and 1960s .
They speak of an active town , a great place to live , comfortable and friendly -- a world apart from what remains today .
Beyond the supposedly dread streets of East St. Louis itself lies a surreal world of small towns and heavy industry , randomly mixed with marshes , fields and forests on the Mississippi bottom lands .
Prosperity and decay crop up unpredictably .
Rail lines and switching yards are everywhere , as the railroads prepare to cross the Mississippi River .
These towns offer an entire world of exploration beyond the bounds of East St. Louis .
I must thank Keith Belk for his gracious and invaluable assistance in creating the original version of this tour .
In 2001 he took me on my first tour of the entire inner Metro East area , not only getting me past the voodoo taboo against venturing into East St. Louis , but also gave me my first introduction to places like Granite City , Sauget , and Brooklyn .
Since then , I 've ventured across the river many times , on my own and with friends .
Nobody 's ever bothered me ; I 've never had any trouble while driving around .
While East St. Louis does have real and serious problems , some of the perceptions do n't match the reality .

Some Arab governments have bridled at critical coverage
At a meeting in Cairo called by Egypt and Saudi Arabia , a charter was adopted allowing authorities to withdraw permits from offending channels .
The only country to refuse to endorse the charter was Qatar , the home of leading satellite station al - Jazeera .
Correspondents say the satellite channels have thrived on controversy .
The often privately financed stations give airtime to government critics and viewers , and discuss issues which state channels would never dare approach , says the BBC's Heba Saleh in Cairo .
' Social harmony '
At the meeting of information ministers from the 22 - nation Arab League in Cairo , the charter was agreed by a vote .
The document calls on stations " not to offend the leaders or national and religious symbols " of Arab countries , news agency AFP reports .
They should not " damage social harmony , national unity , public order or traditional values , " the charter says .
Signatory countries may " withdraw , freeze or not renew the work permits of media which break the regulations " .
The charter also calls on broadcasters to avoid erotic content , or content which promotes smoking or the consumption of alcohol , and to " protect Arab identity from the harmful effects of globalisation " .
Qatari caution
" Some satellite channels have strayed from the correct path , " said Egyptian Information Minister Anas al - Fiqi .
He said it was time to confront those who propagated ignorant or reactionary ideas , and those who tried to score points by undermining governments and nations .
Only Qatar registered reservations about the charter , but said this was down to legal rather than political concerns .
It said it needed further time to consider the document - and so al - Jazeera does not appear to be facing imminent curbs , says our correspondent .

Cheney gets his stump on for the Telecoms that broke the law and helped BushCo implement the warrantless wiretapping program .
Cheney : ... for those who assist the government in tracking terrorists should not be punished with lawsuits .
We 're asking Congress to update FISA and especially to extend this protection to communications providers alleged to have given such assistance anytime after Sept. , 11th 2001 .
This is an important consideration because some providers are facing dozens of lawsuits right now .
Why ?
Because they are believed to have aided the US government in the effort to intercept international communications about al - Qaeda related individuals .
One might even suppose that without liability protection for past activities to aid the government the private sector might be extremely reluctant to comply from future requests from the government .
That risk is unacceptable to the President .
It should be unacceptable to the US Congress .
( There 's a lot more to transcribe . )
You knew there had to be a Rudy in there someplace .
And the President is angry too ... Oh , the poor babies .
Cheney tries to scare the private sector into believing that any future lawbreaking may be prosecuted as well .
Here 's a clue --- it will .
They have the resources to do things efficiently and legally .
There is also this report that the telecoms actually started this program before 9/11 which undermines their terror claims .
Former chief executive Joseph P. Nacchio , convicted in April of 19 counts of insider trading , said the NSA approached Qwest more than six months before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , according to court documents unsealed in Denver this week .
Details about the alleged NSA program have been redacted from the documents , but Nacchio 's lawyer said last year that the NSA had approached the company about participating in a warrantless surveillance program to gather information about Americans ' phone records .
With their multimillion dollar lawyers on hand , Cheney is afraid that they may have to do a little work for their clients .
Why did Qwest decline the WH invitation anyway ?
Sorry Charlie .
This bird do n't fly .
Washington lobbying firm pulls bio of lobbyist accused in McCain scandal , then readds it
The Washington lobbying firm Alcalde & Fay pulled the biography of partner Vicki Iseman from its website Wednesday evening after a New York Times article accused her of having a romantic relationship with Republican presidential nominee shoo - in Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
The removal was caught and reported on by the Huffington Post at 947 pm ET .
RAW STORY , however , found the bio was readded around 11 pm ET Wednesday night .
Originally , Iseman 's corporate biographical profile was posted with the identifying ID tag of " 44 . "
An Aug. 10 , 2007 file at archive.org -- an Internet service which saves older files of websites -- shows Iseman 's bio with the 44 ID .
That bio was deleted Wednesday .
A link to the page with ID 44 came up blank when retrieved late Wednesday evening .
Shortly after the Huffington report , which began appearing elsewhere , the firm apparently reversed course , and reposted Iseman 's profile .
This time , however , a new file was created with the ID of 84 .
The only change between the two is that Iseman 's new profile lists " * private " as her email address .
The previous profile provided her corporate address .
Iseman 's biographical profile follows .
Alcalde and Fay could not be reached for comment late Wednesday night .
VICKI ISEMAN

Bill Nye " The Science Guy " is asking a Los Angeles County judge for protection from his faux wife , after she pulled a late night raid on his flower and produce gardens .
One need n't be scientific to know that marriage is n't going well !
TMZ obtained a request for a temporary restraining order , first reported by The Smoking Gun , filed by Nye against his pseudo - wife of just one year , Blair Tindall .
In the handwritten documents , Bill claims his estranged gal showed up at his Studio City home on Labor Day , dressed in black and armed with two large bottles " filled with some sort of solvent " to do damage to his garden , which he says provides " food produce . "
And it gets crazier !
Nye also alleges that the herbicide was " quite toxic " and thought Tindall might have squirted him in the eyes with it had she gotten closer .
Not very Nyes !
Boing Boing hero Paul Krassner ( wiki ) kindly gave us permission to run this essay he wrote titled : " My Brief Encounter With Fidel Castro "
In 1960 , the U.S. State Department was financing counterrevolutionary broadcasts to Cuba from a radio station on Swan Island in Honduras .
Program content ranged from telling Cubans that their children would be taken away to warning them that a Russian drug was being added to their food and milk which would automatically turn them into Communists .
My friend Lyle Stuart was national treasurer of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee , which sponsored a trip to Cuba that December , and he invited me to come along .
On New Year 's Eve , at an outdoor dinner celebrating the anniversary of the revolution , 15,000 Cubans , including 10,000 voluntary teachers , were bidding goodbye to the Year of Agrarian Reform and welcoming in the Year of Education .
Although Fidel Castro accused the United States of planning to attack Cuba , the few hundred Americans who had been invited were greeted with applause , cheering and kiss - throwing .
At midnight the Cubans sang " The 26th of July Song , " and their cardboard plates went scaling through the air , mingling with a display of fireworks .
There was a full - scale learn - to - read - and - write campaign .
In several industries , every employee would give one cent a day throughout the year to the Minister of Education .
In the Sierra Maestra , where battles once raged , there were now under construction schools and dormitories for 20,000 children , to match the 20,000 Cubans who had lost their lives , many after torture , under the U.S. - supported Batista regime .
At one of these educational communities , some young students removed the string that had been set up by a landscaping crew to mark off a cement foundation .
Next morning , the school director lectured them about such immorality .
" Even a little thing like that , " he explained , " does harm to the revolution . "
The children of Cuba were being programmed for cooperation rather than competition .
This sense of utter involvement in the revolution provided the radionalization Cubans gave when I asked about the lack of a free press , critical of the revolution .
" We get the New York Times , " I was told , " and that 's enough . "
On January 2 , there was a parade , with female soldiers marching in conga fashion , heavy tanks ripping away at well - paved streets , and a Macy 's - type float that was actually the reconstructed American space rocket which had been fired from Cape Canaveral the previous November , only to be destroyed just after launching when it proved defective .
Fragments had fallen in Cuba , killing a cow .
Now the revolutionary slogan , " Venceremos " ( " We Will Win " ) was temporarily changed to " We Will Win , With or Without Cows . "
One evening , there was a reception at the Presidential Palace for several hundred visitors from around the world .
When Castro arrived in the main ballroom , he was surrounded by an eager , protoplasmic circle of admirers and well - wishers .
He stood tall and handsome in their midst , uniformed but hatless .
The throng of people with Castro at the hub surged forward a few feet at a time toward the end of the ballroom and finally gave way to a line that formed to meet him , one by one .
Some asked him to pose with them , which he did .
A man with a camera stood on a plush chair for a better angle , but his wife , who was posing with Castro , yelled at him .
" Max !
Do n't stand on that chair !
This is a palace ! "
I gave Castro a copy of my magazine , The Realist , and requested an interview .
He told me to set it up with his secretary .
Then a palace guard handed him a cablegram from President Dwight Eisenhower –in the final weeks of his lame - duck presidency –calling off diplomatic relations with Cuba .
I asked Castro for a statement .
" I do not think it is up to me to comment , " he said , " since it is the United States that has broken relations .
I will say only that Cuba is alert . "
There was no official announcement at the Presidential Palace , but the news spread rapidly among the guests as Castro strode across the ballroom and departed .
I had brought Lawrence Ferlinghetti's Coney Island of the Mind to Cuba .
The next day , I was in my hotel room , sitting on the bidet and reading his long poem , " I Am Waiting , " while waiting in vain for a call from Fidel Castro 's secretary .
But Castro obviously had more important things to do than answer my questions .
In retrospect , though , I would like to have asked him , " How do you feel about term limits ? "
When the C.I.A. ’s destruction of several interrogation tapes was revealed for the first time , many bloggers reserved much of their vitriol for Democrats who were consulted beforehand .
“ The Democratic leadership really needs to start taking these Intel Committee postings more seriously , ” Matthew Yglesias wrote at Atlantic Monthly .
Two days later , The Washington Post widened the criticism from a lack of opposition to the tape destruction to a lack of protest in general for the Bush administration ’s wider interrogation policy as it was formed in 2002 and 2003 .
But both issues were addressed by one Democrat on February 10 , 2003 , according to a letter declassified today from Representative Jane Harman of California , who was the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee .
Here ’s her warning on destroying the tape :
I would urge the Agency to reconsider that plan .
Even if the videotape does not constitute an official record that must be preserved under the law , the videotape would be the best proof that the written record is accurate , if such record is called into question in the future .
The fact of destruction would reflect badly on the Agency .
And here ’s her sharp question on harsh interrogation techniques :
I would like to know whether the most senior levels of the White House have determined that these practices are consistent with the principles and policies of the United States .
Have enhanced techniques been authorized and approved by the President ?
“ I look forward to your response , ” she said before signing off .
But while Scott W. Muller , then the agency ’s general counsel , politely thanked her for the letter , he completely ignored the tape issue .
On her bigger concern , he said she should “ assume that policy as well as legal matters have been addressed within the Executive Branch . ”
Copies of both letters are available here .
Whether the letter itself was enough to relieve at least Ms. Harman of criticism remains to be seen .
When the news broke in December , she described the letter but one critic was unassuaged :
“ When she found out the CIA had destroyed the tapes , where was Harman ’s press conference ? , ” Marty Lederman wrote at Balkinization .
“ Where were the congressional hearings ? ”
Today , Ms. Harman said that there was no way she could hold a news conference .
“ I was unable to discuss this matter publicly , ” she said , citing the matter ’s “ highly classified nature . ”
In comments to The Post , she detailed why , saying that “ When you serve on intelligence committee you sign a second oath — one of secrecy . ”
But was there more she could do besides taking the C.I.A. counsel at his word ?
The reactions are just starting to pour in .
A 25 - year - old woman committed suicide by setting herself ablaze at her residence in Nizampura locality of Bhiwandi around 6 : 30 am on the February 14 .
The victim , Afsana Ansari , suffered 90 per cent burns on her body and was taken to the Thane Civil Hospital where she died on Monday evening , her 3 - year - old daughter Kunuk who was along with her when she set herself ablaze also suffered 40 per cent burns .
According to Afsana ’s parents , she was four months ’ pregnant and she took the extreme step because her in - laws kept harassing her by asking for money from her parents .
“ Afsana was very well - natured woman and she would never have taken such an extreme step in her life .
It is only because of her in - laws , who kept making demands for money from her , that she committed suicide .
She might have been murdered by her in - laws because they were not allowing us to meet her elder daughter who was there at home when the incident took place , ” said Afsana ’s mother Aqeela .
Afsana ’s husband Akbar ran a powerloom at Bhiwandi and was not doing well in his business .
When the incident took place , he was also home and tried to save her and suffered burns .
Nizampura police had earlier registered the case under sections 498 A , 323 , 504 , and 34 of IPC but after the death of Afsana and her unborn baby , section 306 ( abetment to suicide ) has also been registered against the accused .
Afsana ’s brothers - in - law Akram and and Aslam have been arrested by the Nizampura police .
“ We are investigating the case and trying to find if there is any chance of murder , as of now , we have booked the two accused for dowry demand , threatening and abetment to suicide .
The victim ’s husband is also recuperating at the hospital and we will also speak to him ” said the investigating officer , HM More .
The world of illegal downloading suffered a severe blow Thursday when Swedish authorities charged four people for operating the world 's most popular BitTorrent site – The Pirate Bay– which allows users to retrieve free movies , music and video games , much of which is copyrighted .
Those charged include Hans Fredrik Neij , Per Svartholm Warg , Peter Kolmisoppi and Carl Lundstroem .
According to charges lodged in Stockholm , the four are accused of " promoting other people 's infringements of copyright laws . "
The four face a potential year in jail .
The Bay has been on the authorities ' watchlist for years .
In June , 2006 , a police raid shuttered it for three days after the authorities confiscated its servers , which were later moved to the Netherlands .
The raid sparked street protests in Sweden , which has some of the loosest copyright laws in Europe , and gained the site an immense international and mainstream presence .
" The investigation into The Pirate Bay by the Swedish authorities has been extensive and we are happy to rely on the judicial process to reach a just decision in this case , " said Motion Picture Assocation of America spokeswoman Elizabeth Kaltman .
Hours later , Kaltman told THREAT LEVEL that the MPAA had complained to Swedish authorities : " We made criminal complaints about Pirate Bay 's well - known activities , " Kaltman said .
" Thereafter the entire investigation was in the hands of the police and local authorities . "
In a statement , prosecutor Hakan Roswall said the site produces about $ 4 million in revenue annually .
The Pirate Kings of Sweden Secrets of the Pirate Bay
Prior efforts to sink the word 's largest BitTorrent tracker have backfired into political scandal , and spurred even more downloading .
A Nation Divided over Piracy
The Pirate Bay survives , and politicians and entertainment lawyers confront a youth movement that embraces file sharing .
Who would have thought Sweden would end up the internet 's free content haven ?
Gallery : The Faces of Sweden 's Pirate Wars
" The operation of The Pirate Bay is financed through advertising revenues .
In that way , it commercially exploits copyright - protected work and performances , " he said .
The Pirate Bay 's popular blog has this comment posted .
" In case we lose the pending trial ( yeah right ) there will still not be any changes to the site .
The Pirate Bay will keep operating just as always .
We ’ve been here for years and we will be here for many more . "
An older post notes this recent milestone .
" We 've got reasons to celebrate .
Millions of them ! " the blog read .
" This week we 've hit the magic numbers .
We 're tracking over 1 million torrents .
We have had over 10 million simultaneous peers on the trackers .
We 're at 2.5 million registered users ( and they are active as well ) .
And this is blog post 100 ! "
The site 's popularity has grown in the wake of the recent shuttering of Isohunt , TorrentSpy and other BitTorrent tracking sites to U.S. - based traffic .
Those sites , rather than abide by a court order and turn over to the Motion Picture Association of America information on its American users , blocked their access to protect their users ' privacy .
The Pirate Bay allows users to search for and download indexed torrents , which contain the information needed to download data containing the copyright - infringing content from other users of the service .
" The operators of The Pirate Bay have always been interested in making money , not music .
The Pirate Bay has managed to make Sweden , normally the most law abiding of EU countries , look like a piracy haven with intellectual property laws on a par with Russia , " said John Kennedy , chairman and chief executive of International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , which represents the recording industry worldwide .
" We welcome the filing of these charges in Sweden , " he continued .
" The evidence presented by the prosecutor shows that The Pirate Bay , which claims to be motivated by idealism , is really motivated by making money . "
E-mail to The Pirate Bay were not immediately returned .
Regardless of what happens to The Pirate Bay , illegal downloading is expected to flourish .
When sites are taken down , others pop up .
Last year , for example , the popular OINK music file - sharing site was shuttered by the authorities .
In its wake , Waffles emerged with thousands of music sharers .

“ With the way that he ’s playing this right now , it features all the things that we like least about Michael Bloomberg , ” said David S. Birdsell , dean of the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College .
“ It features him as the testy , hard - to - satisfy critic of candidates who are already in the race , and it buttresses , the longer this goes on , the aloof critic role we might associate with a billionaire above the political fray rather than the dedicated politician and competent manager . ”
Adding to the potential for national ennui , Mr. Birdsell said , was “ the very long and frustrating Fred Thompson dance over the summer , ” which reduced the tolerance for indecision .
“ That is going to make everybody considerably more focused on getting him to declare and to not have an erosion of enthusiasm that Fred Thompson experienced , ” he said .
Closer to home , though , the impatience is already palpable , and could grow as the city ’s economic situation turns more dire .
After five years of ballooning surpluses , the Independent Budget Office last week projected a $ 3.1 billion deficit in 2009 and $ 4.6 billion in 2010 , driven by the housing slump and softening Wall Street profits .
“ There ’s been a sea change where we ’re moving into choppier fiscal waters that we have n’t had to navigate before , ” said Scott M. Stringer , the Manhattan borough president .
With the convergence of what is shaping up to be a painful budget process this month and the presidential campaign calendar , he said , “ they ’re going to have to show their cards . ”
“ He has this great political good will , ” he said , “ but this is the day - to - day work of being the mayor and it ’s going to be hard to do the day - to - day work while slipping off to Oklahoma , unless we New Yorkers know what the program is . ”
George Arzt , a political consultant who was press secretary to Mayor Edward I. Koch , said that Mr. Bloomberg was risking the political fate of Mayor John V. Lindsay , whose 1972 presidential campaign took a hit when Brooklyn ’s powerful Democratic Party boss , Meade H. Esposito , urged him to end his cross-country campaigning and address the city ’s growing economic ills .
University of Nebraska - Lincoln graduate student Adam Caprez fires up the pulsed electron laser used to test the no forces aspect of the Aharonov - Bohm effect .
Credit : Herman Batelaan
An action does n’t always result in a reaction .
One of the interesting phenomena present in quantum mechanics is the Aharonov - Bohm ( AB ) effect .
The AB effect predicts that a charged particle , usually an electron in experiments , shows effects from electromagnetic fields in regions where the particle is excluded .
This leads to the interesting fact that , in electromagnetism , Newton ’s Third Law of Motion does n’t always hold true .
Herman Batelaan explains to PhysOrg.com : “ If you want to move anything in the world around you , you need forces .
But in the Aharonov - Bohm effect , the electron reacts without any forces .
There is no force , but something happens . ”
Batelaan , a scientist at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln oversaw an experiment done by graduate student , Adam Caprez , and Brett Barwick to demonstrate the absence of forces in the AB effect .
A description of the experiment , and their results , is available in Physical Review Letters : “ Macroscopic Test of the Aharonov - Bohm Effect . ”
“ The interesting thing , ” Batelaan says , “ is that experimentally scientists have detected evidence of this effect , and it is mentioned in textbooks .
But nobody had shown that no forces are there . ”
The experiment performed at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln constitutes the first demonstration of a lack of forces .
“ We know the effects , and this is expected . ” Batelaan continues .
“ Theoretically , scientist predicted this , but we want to see this .
Now we have it . ”
Experimental demonstrations of the AB effect usually include carefully controlled electrons using a distant electromagnetic field .
“ We understand the physics of this , such that we can take electrons and control them so well that we can see quantum mechanics happening , ” Batelaan says .
In order to perform the current experiment , the team used a pulse laser to hit a metal needle , a method developed at Stanford .
“ You have a pulsed electron source , ” Batelaan explains , “ and you have something you can time . ”
Batelaan says that if a force is present there will either be a delay , or an early arrival .
The experiment showed no time delay , and this demonstrates that the AB effect lacks forces , even though something is clearly happening with the electrons .
Caprez said that what he found most appealing is that , “ we have a rare example where quantum mechanics , electromagnetism and relativity are all working at the same time . ”
As far as immediate applications are concerned , Batelaan admits that there is n’t much about this experiment that will be useful on a practical level right now .
But , he insists , “ This is very fundamental quantum mechanically .
It is helpful in terms of a better understanding on the quantum level . ”
He points out that devices are reducing in size at a rapid pace , and that as science and technology shrink , “ we will need to understand the interplay between quantum mechanics and electromagnetic fields as deep as possible . ”

UPDATE : Our voices have been heard !
The ICANN Board of Directors a resolution was passed which will end domain tasting as we know it , including this Network Solutions scandal .
Read the full story here on DotSauce .
There has been an uproar today about a recent devious tactic being used by one of the original ICANN accredited registrars , NetworkSolutions .
Apparently they are internally registering each and every domain name that a user searches for using their website , essentially holding it hostage so that it can not be purchased at any other significantly cheaper and more ethical registrar .
Stratagenix , a member of DomainState writes :
BEWARE : Do n’t Search For Names At NetworkSolutions.com
Network Solutions has instituted a 4 day lock on all domain names searched on their site .
They are effectively using phishing techniques to hijack or steal domain names and forcing domain name registrants to register their names at Network Solutions .
Boycott Network Solutions
This kind of tactic can destroy a company ’s reputation .
Many registrars have been accused of selling their whois search data to domain tasting companies , but never has any company immediately secured domain searches in their name as they are searched for .
I urge you to never use Network Solutions and spread the word about this scandalous practice .
Stratagenix later replies in the discussion topic :
I contacted ICANN and they said that although they believe it to be an unethical business practice ….
it is legal for Network Solutions to hijack domain names and hold them … .
ICANN stated that there is nothing they can do to stop the practice .
What is the best / safest site to look for domain names ?
Where you should be Searching Instead
I personally use Moniker ’s Bulk Search tool because it is safe , reliable and fast .
I then register my desired domain names at GoDaddy for various reasons , mainly that it is the most popular and desirable for domain buyers .
Have Your Say
You can discuss the NetworkSolutions situation at DotSauce Forums , NamePros or DomainState .
This news has also been announced by other domain industry blogs : Conceptualist , Elliot ’s Blog , Dominik Mueller , DomainBits and hopefully more will follow soon .
The OpenGL ARB unveiled the name and more details of the new version of OpenGL formerly know as Longs Peak - now officially OpenGL 3 - on August 8th 2007 at the Siggraph Birds of a Feather ( BOF ) in San Diego , CA .

" I guess they 'll sell a ton of pizzas to people with no social life who are sitting in front of computers . " -- Christopher Muller , restaurant expert at the University of Central Florida , who 's less than enthusiastic about pizza - tracking tech After ordering pizza for the gang on Super Bowl Sunday , many folks will be able to go online and track the progress of their pies .
Domino's , ( DPZ ) the pizza - delivery kingpin , on Wednesday will unveil a technology , Pizza Tracker , that lets customers literally track their pizza from the moment they place the order until it leaves the store en route to them .
What 's more , Domino 's vows that its online tracking system — for phone or online orders — is accurate to within 40 seconds .
" We 're filling that black box of uncertainty — ' Has my pizza been forgotten ? ' — with information and entertainment , " says Chris McGlothlin , technology chief at Domino's .
The system goes up Wednesday at 3,400 Domino 's outlets and will be in all stores by June 30 , he says .
It even gives folks the first names of the workers who take their phone order and deliver their pizza — and asks customers to rate them .
Any customer comments about inappropriate behavior by order takers or delivery staff will be investigated , spokesman Tim McIntyre says .
In a nation ever eager to track delivery of everything from FedEx packages to Amazon.com orders , it 's now come down to tonight 's pizza .
The move by Domino's is aimed at its youthful target : consumers under age 30 who spend gobs of time online .
Sadly , there are probably a bunch of people who will be enamored of this , says Christopher Muller , director of the Center for Multi - Unit Restaurant Management at University of Central Florida .
" I guess they 'll sell a ton of pizzas to people with no social life who are sitting in front of computers . "
But not everyone 's so sure .
" It 's technology in search of a problem , " says Brian Kardon , chief strategy officer at Forrester Research , a technology researcher .
" I do n't know how many consumers are twisting and turning over the state of their delivery pizza . "
Domino 's says plenty are .
" It 's an emotional roller coaster when you order , " McGlothlin says .
" Customers wonder : Did they get my order ?
Are they taking care of me ?
Will it show up ? "
With the new system , after an order is placed , the customer can go to dominos.com , click on the Pizza Tracker icon and follow the progress of the order .
The site confirms that the order has been received , when the pizza is in the oven , when it 's been boxed and when it 's left the store .
Alas , a key part of the pizza 's journey cannot be pinpointed : the drive from Domino 's to your home .
But Domino 's can tell folks when their pizza left the store , and officials say it should arrive within nine minutes of that time .
Rival Pizza
Hut is unimpressed .
PizzaHut.com already provides an estimated time when customers will receive their orders , says Bob Kraut , vice president of marketing .
Enlarge By Toby Giberson , AP Domino 's says that its online tracking system is accurate to within 40 seconds .

American Airlines today disputed the account of a man who said his cousin died aboard a flight after she was twice refused oxygen by a flight attendant .
He also claimed that medical devices , including two oxygen tanks , failed .
Struggling to breathe , passenger Carine Desir , who had heart disease , asked for oxygen , but was initially denied , her cousin said Sunday .
“ Do n’t let me die , ” the cousin , Antonio Oliver , recalled Desir , 44 , saying after the attendant allegedly refused at first to administer the oxygen Friday .
He said the flight attendant finally relented but various medical devices on the plane did not work , including two oxygen tanks that were found to be empty and what may have been a defibrillator that seemed to malfunction .
American Airlines confirmed Desir ’s death and said medical professionals had tried to save the woman .
Today , airline spokesman Charley Wilson said there were 12 oxygen tanks on the plane and the crew checked them before the flight took off to make sure they were working .
He said at least two were used on Desir .
“ American Airlines , after investigation , has determined that oxygen was administered on the aircraft , and it was working , and the defibrillator was applied as well , ” he said .
Wilson said he did n’t know whether a flight attendant initially refused to administer oxygen to Desir .
Desir , of New York City , died of natural causes , medical examiner ’s office spokeswoman Ellen Borakove said Sunday .
Desir had complained of not feeling well and being very thirsty on the Friday flight home from Port - au - Prince , Haiti , after she ate a meal , according to Oliver , who was traveling with her and her brother , Joel Desir .
A flight attendant gave her water , he said .
A few minutes later , Desir said she was having “ trouble breathing ” and asked for oxygen , but a flight attendant twice refused her request , Oliver said .
He said other passengers aboard Flight 896 became agitated over the situation , and the flight attendant , apparently after phone consultation with the cockpit , tried to administer oxygen from a portable tank and mask , but the tank was empty .
Oliver said two doctors and two nurses were aboard and tried to administer oxygen from a second tank , which also was empty .
Desir was placed on the floor , and a nurse tried CPR , Oliver said .
A “ box , ” possibly a defibrillator , also was applied but did n’t function effectively , he said .
Oliver said he then asked for the plane to “ land right away so I can get her to a hospital , ” and the pilot agreed to divert to Miami , 45 minutes away .
But during that time Desir collapsed and died , Oliver said .
“ Her last words were , ‘ I can not breathe , ” ’ he said .
Wilson said three flight attendants helped Desir , but “ stepped back ” after doctors and nurses on the flight began to help her .
“ Our crew acted very admirably .
They did what they were trained to do , and the equipment was working , ” he said .
Desir was pronounced dead by one of the doctors , Joel Shulkin , and the flight continued to John F. Kennedy International Airport , without stopping in Miami .
The woman ’s body was moved to the floor of the first - class section and covered with a blanket , Oliver said .
Shulkin , through his attorney , Justin Nadeau , declined to comment on the incident .
There was a time in history when almost everything was manual , even if there were more than enough digital solutions ...
Jose Espinosa and Otis Blunt hail from different towns and very likely were strangers until they wound up in the same jail , a drab building of sealed windows rising 14 stories behind the courthouse in downtown Elizabeth , N.J .
The two men both had violent reputations : Mr. Espinosa had pleaded guilty in a drive - by shooting death , and Mr. Blunt had done prison time for assault and armed robbery .
What they also had in common was a cinder - block wall that divided their cells and , apparently , a desire not to be incarcerated any longer .
On Saturday , the Union County authorities said , Mr. Espinosa and Mr. Blunt staged a cinematic escape from the jail , using dummies fashioned out of bedsheets and pictures of pinup models to cover their tracks .
They squeezed out of their cells and out of the building through holes barely larger than a sheet of legal paper and then long - jumped 16 feet from a roof over a fence topped with razor wire , landing on a railroad bed .
Two sets of footprints , each pointing in a different direction , showed that the men parted ways as soon as they hit the ground , the authorities said .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain said for the first time on Thursday the United States had used British territory to transfer terrorism suspects , in an embarrassing apology that corrected previous denials .
Britain , after maintaining for years it was unaware of a British link to such “ rendition ” flights , said Washington had now told it two planes with detainees refueled at a U.S. base on the British Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia in 2002 .
Allegations of covert U.S. activities as part of the “ war on terror ” have circulated for years .
A European investigator said last year he had proof Poland and Romania hosted secret prisons for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency .
“ Contrary to earlier explicit assurances that Diego Garcia had not been used for rendition flights , recent U.S. investigations have now revealed two occasions , both in 2002 , when this had in fact occurred , ” British Foreign Secretary David Miliband told parliament .
“ In both cases a U.S. plane with a single detainee on board refueled at the U.S. facility in Diego Garcia , ” he said .
It is embarrassing for the government , already sensitive to criticism that it is too ready to follow Washington ’s line , with Tony Blair , who was prime minister at the time , dubbed in the press as President George W. Bush ’s “ poodle ” .
“ It ’s unfortunate mistakes were made in the reporting of the information , but we will continue to have good counter - terrorism cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom , ” Gordon Johndroe , spokesman for the White House National Security Council , told reporters traveling with Bush in Liberia .
STAUNCH ALLY
Britain , Washington ’s leading ally in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , has previously said it was not aware of its territory being used to transfer terrorism suspects outside normal extradition procedures since Bush took office in 2001 .
Washington has admitted to the practice , known as “ rendition ” .
Miliband said he was “ very sorry indeed ” to have to correct earlier government denials , based on new information from the U.S. government .
Washington had told Britain that neither of the detainees was British , Miliband said , without revealing their identity .
One was being held at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and the other had been released .
He said the two detainees had not been taken to a secret detention facility and had not undergone water boarding or other similar forms of interrogation .
The U.S. Congress last week voted to ban the CIA from using water boarding , a simulated drowning technique widely condemned by human rights groups as a form of torture .
Miliband said he had discussed the issue on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who had pledged there would be no renditions through Britain , its air space or territories without express British permission .
Britain would draw up a list of all suspicious flights through Britain or its overseas territories and ask for U.S. assurance that they were not used for rendition , he said .
Miliband agreed the matter was serious but said Britain would continue to have “ the strongest possible intelligence and counter - terrorism relationship with the U.S. ”
When people who do surveys for a living create the questions for a quality of life survey , they often ask about things such as your income , your relationship status , and your job satisfaction … but they almost never ask a question that has far more impact :
How is your self - worth ?
Let ’s step back for a moment … what isself - worth ?
It is , quite simply , the value you place on yourself .
Do you think that you , as a whole , have no value , low value , average , or high ?
Low self - worth often leads to depression , sometimes deep enough to bring on thoughts of suicide .
Even a small problem with self - worth can drain the energy from your life .
Are you satisfied with yourself ?
Are you truly confident in your relationships with others ( not just on the outside ) ?
When you think of yourself , do you think of the good things first ?
Do you truly believe you are worthy of success , and have the confidence to go out and act like it ?
If you answered yes to all of the questions above , you wo n’t need the rest of this article , unless you ’re just looking for a refresher .
If you answered no , particularly if you answered no to all of the questions , read on .
Step Back
The first thing you need to do to rebuild your self - worth is to step back from your current life .
You may need to take a day off to do this … and I mean a day off of everything .
No work , no school , no family … get a babysitter if you need it .
This is a day to just be alone and be able to leave the rest of the world behind .
You spend enough of your time and energy on the rest of the world … take some time to just let all of that go .
Understand Your Independence Ironically , low self - worth almost always comes from other people … in a way .
Low self - worth is very nearly always the result of your perception that someone , a person in whom you have invested a lot of your time and energy , does n’t respect or does n’t love you .
You may even be wrong … they may respect and love you , but that does n’t matter … it ’s your perception that counts .
The key here is to understand that you are indepedent .
No one else has any control whatsoever over who you are ….
even if someone does or says something horrible to you , it only changes who you are if you choose to have it do so .
The choice may be subconscious , but it ’s still there .
That means that your worth is also independent of everyone else .
Your worth only comes from you … because who you are only comes from you .
Let Go Of Pain From The Past
Once you have begun to understand your independence , it ’s time to start letting go of the pain from your past .
You can start with the big things , the ones that caused the low self - worth in the first place , or you can start with the little things , as they ease the overall burden , freeing up more resources when you work on the big ones .
Letting go of mental pain is seldom easy or painless … but when you let go of something big , the sheer relief of not dragging it around with you any more can be amazing .
Letting go of one really big thing can change your entire perspective on life .
More detailed directions for letting go of the pain can be found here .
Discover Who You Really Are
The next step , after you start dealing with your pain ( you certainly do n’t have to , and probably should n’t , wait until it ’s all done ) , is to figure out who you really are .
That means figuring out what your core values are , the things that really deep down inside are what drive you .
You can find this by sitting down by yourself , in a time and place that you wo n’t be interrupted , and writing down each thing that comes to mind as a possibility , without thinking about it .
When they stop coming so fast , look back over what you ’ve already written down , and see if there are any that simply do n’t belong ( there probably will be ) , and if there are any recurring themes ( like helping people who need it ) .
Write down any new ideas inspired by looking back over the list , and keep going until you ’re down to things where you can feel , not think , that they are right .
Make Like / Dislike Lists
After you discover who you really are , at your core , the next thing to do is to look at the next layer up , the things that overlay that core .
That means coming up with things that you like and things that you dislike about yourself .
Try to find something that you do like for each thing that you do n’t like … it will help to keep you from focusing so much on the bad things .
When making these lists , it ’s a good idea to break it down into pieces … for example , when I did this myself , I used three categories : physical , mental / emotional , and personality .
When making the list for physical , try not to focus too much on things that you ca n’t change ( like your height ) and stick to the ones you can , like your grooming , or your physical fitness .
Make An “ I Want To Do ” List After you make you list of likes and dislikes , you can move on to making a list of things you want to do .
This can be things that are purely want , like learning to play guitar , or things that improve upon the things that you put on your dislike list , such as exercising ( if you do n’t like your physical fitness ) .
My “ want to do ” list includes things like eating better , exercising more , writing a book ( 3 , actually … already have ideas for two and started one a long time ago ) , and cooking more .
It ’s considerably longer than that , but hopefully that will give you some ideas of the range of things you can put on this list .
Take Action On Each Dislike
Whether it ’s on your “ want to do ” list or not , for each dislike that you listed in step # 5 , you need to find an action that moves you in the direction you want to go .
The hardest part about changing yourself and becoming who you want to be is the first step … once you get moving in the right direction , it ’s much easier to continue that path .
One thing to keep in mind , though , is that you do n’t need to make massive changes all at once … in fact , that can be counterproductive .
Small steps still get you a little momentum in the right direction , and they add up without exhausting you .
Get Started On Your “ I Want To Do ” List Fun is important , too … do n’t make everything work .
Pick some of the fun , unimportant things off your “ want to do ” list and get started on them .
Sign up for classes , buy the necessary equipment , or whatever else you need to do , and get started .
Fun and creativity are extremely important … they are , in a sense , “ rest ” for your mind , and any time you want to grow , physically or mentally , rest is important .
Evaluate Your Progress
So now you ’ve made all these changes , and taken action , and started doing things that are fun and make you happy … it ’s time to step back and evaluate how far you ’ve come .
Look at not just the visible difference , but also the difference in the way you feel .
Looking at how far you ’ve come , especially if you write it down , too , can really help you to keep going .
Sometimes it ’s easy to focus on the destination , and only see how far away it is , rather than looking at where you started from , and how far you ’ve come since then .
That kind of focus , on what you have n’t done , rather than what you have , can sap your motivation , your energy , amazingly quickly .

Microsoft 's latest idea for tackling Internet Explorer 's lack of web standards compliance in the up - coming IE 8 has attracted a barrage of criticism .
Chris Wilson , Microsoft 's IE platform architect , and chief IE bullet taker , has explained how Microsoft intends to overcome standards and backwards compatibility problems by using a version switch .
Rather than change the IE architecture , Microsoft is putting the onus on developers to include a meta element on every web page to identify the appropriate rendering engine .
Simple , huh ?
So simple , the Web Standards Project supports the idea and has gone as far as to suggest this should be extended to other browsers .
That 's an idea , though , that 's been rejected by both Safari and Mozilla , for various reasons , chiefly : they already enjoy a high - degree of compliance with web standards .
Opera dryly welcomed Microsoft 's belated recognition of standards .
However , Opera 's Anne van Kesteren joined Google HTML 5 spec author Ian Hixie in criticizing Microsoft 's move for making web development even more complicated that it already is .
Developers in the broader community have also reacted negatively to what they see as Microsoft side - stepping its responsibility to comply with web standards .
Doubts , meanwhile , have been raised about IE 8's ability to pass the Acid 2 rendering test - an indication of a browser 's standards compliance .
Håkon Wiem Lie , chief technology officer at Opera , said he belives Microsoft could find a way to get around genuine Acid 2 support in the final IE 8 release . ®

Half the subprimes were cash out refis .
This is n't implausible .
Freddie Mac reported that cash - out ( meaning the new mortgage was at least 5 % larger than the one it replaced ) refis for its borrowers were 35 % in the second quarter of 2007 , and noted that refinancings as a proportion of total mortgages were declining , which is typical in a rising interest rate environment .
Now why is this so significant ?
It gives a completely different picture of the nature of the problem .
It suggests that many of the people who took out subprimes were n't people who bought more housing than they could afford .
It says they were already overstressed and overstretched financially .
Using their home as a source of cash was a gamble to keep themselves out of bankruptcy , but in many cases , that bet did n't work out .
The high proportion of cash - out refis suggests that it would behoove someone to do some investigation to get a better grip on why people took these loans and what became of them .
Were most , as Lee suggested , in bad shape and taking the one way they saw out , or were they merely foolhardy overspenders ?
If they needed the new mortgage to pay off other debts , how did they get in trouble in the first place ?
The last large scale study of why people filed for bankruptcy ( published in 2005 but looking at 2001 bankruptcies ) found medical expenses were the top reason and job loss / interruption was number two .
If these are the real reasons that a large proportion of subprime borrowers went that route , it suggests a completely different set of remedies than if it is say , primarily a housing bubble ( too many people felt they could gamble on appreciation ) or predatory lender problem .
Dean Baker pointed out that some borrowers defaulted before reset , which suggests that pre-existing financial stress may have played a role :
[ M] any of the subprimes were seriously delinquent or in foreclosure long before the mortgages reset to higher rates .
In an analysis done early this year , the FDIC found that 10 percent of the subprime adjustable rate mortgages issued in 2006 were seriously delinquent ( missed three or more payments ) or in foreclosure within 10 months of issuance .
A parenthetical note : that bankruptcy study is horrendous and should never be cited by anyone .
It counted any bankruptcy in which the parties had more than $ 1,000 in uninsured medical bills as having been caused by the bankruptcy , even when the respondents themselves cited other reasons .
$ 1,000 is a nasty sum , but no matter how poor you are , it is not bankruptcy - level .
Anyone who declares bankruptcy over a couple of thousand dollars worth of debt should sue their lawyer for incompetence .
More rigorous studies find the commonest causes of bankruptcy are divorce and job loss ; where medical problems are a cause , the main factor is usually income loss from lost work , not bills .
Medical providers will almost always take a workout rather than bankruptcy .
But the broader point is interesting -- though Yves , like most observers , is more interested than I am in assigning blame .
I 'm less interested in who was wrong , than in what broad forces pushed us in this direction .
And he hints at an interesting one :
One other factor that may have contributed to the subprime frenzy : Lew Ranieri , the so - called father of mortgage backed securities , has stated that the overheated phase of subprime lending started at the end of the third quarter of 2005 and extended through most of 2006 .
When did the new bankruptcy law take effect ?
October 24 , 2005 .
There is no ready way to prove a connection between the new law and the explosion phase of subprime growth , but consumers became much more cautious in taking on credit card debt after the law became effective .
And the ones that had above median incomes which would force them into a Chapter 13 ( meaning they'd have to repay their debts ) might be even more eager to tap home equity if they saw themselves at risk .
One way to cast this : mean lenders got Congress to change the bankruptcy laws , which meant people desperte to get out of their credit card debt put their houses on the line .
Another way : irresponsible borrowers confronted with the cost of their past profligacy , gambled their houses , too .
The interesting explanation , though , I think is more value - neutral .
From what I hear , the evidence on bankruptcy reform is that all the actors involved behaved in a perfectly economically predictible way .
Lenders , with more assurance that they would be repaid , became more willing to lend .
But borrowers became less willing to borrow , so the amount of credit supplied to the market contracted .
( Incidentally , people who think that we should protect the poor from credit cards and payday lenders should be glad about this . )
But there was a huge credit glut in this country , thanks in part to a torrential inflow of foreign capital .
That credit had to go somewhere ; if credit card borrowers would n't take it , they 'd just offer cheaper rates to someone else . . . like mortgage borrowers .
Mortgages are n't much affected by bankruptcy , because it 's secured debt .
Under the new law , as the old , borrowers either hold onto the house by committing to meet the payments , or surrender it to the lender .
So falling interest rates in that market , especially combined with rising prices , were likely to produce the bubble conditions we saw .
Our goal - our one and only goal - is to elect Ron Paul president of the United States .
But as of this message , time is not on our side .
We have approximately 900 hours until the Iowa caucuses and about 1,000 hours until voters in New Hampshire go to the polls .
That 's just 900 hours for all of us to do what we can to make sure Ron Paul wins the Republican nomination for president .
Dr. Paul 's best opportunity to win the nomination is for him to make a strong showing in the early primary states of New Hampshire , Iowa , Michigan , South Carolina , and Nevada .
Appropriately , the most important part of our campaign strategy is an unrelenting blitz of radio and TV ads in these states .
The evidence shows very strongly that consistent , targeted media exposure is the best tool to increase Ron Paul 's name recognition .
It 's no accident that Dr. Paul is surging in early primary states .
Recent polls show him at 8 % in New Hampshire , Nevada , and South Carolina , and 6 % in Iowa .
In most cases , this represents a doubling of our poll numbers in just two weeks !
Your grassroots support on the ground , coupled with targeted media is critical to all of these efforts .
Because half of " likely voters " still have n't heard of Ron Paul , we have plenty of room to double our poll numbers again .
The donations that you make now allow us to continue our current level of intense media in these states uninterrupted .
Remember :
We 're battling against the likes of Mitt Romney , who is spending close to a million dollars per week on TV ads alone .
The more we raise , and the sooner we raise it , the better we can compete .
And now that Michigan 's primary also will be held in January , meeting the $ 12 million mark as soon as possible is more important than ever .
This goal represents the minimum amount that we believe is necessary to make a strong run at the nomination .
But because of the wealth and connections of the other candidates , none of us should be content with any amount that we raise .
After all , we can't be satisfied with merely giving Ron Paul a chance to win the Republican nomination .
We have to be determined to give him the absolute best chance possible .
The political elites recognize that Ron Paul is for real , and that he is the only first tier candidate with a message that threatens their power .
It 's no wonder that Rudy Giuliani , as reported in yesterday 's Washington Post , is now on the offensive against Ron Paul .
Everyone involved in any way with this campaign has been making sacrifices that often go unnoticed and unrecognized .
The selflessness with which you all donate to and volunteer for Ron Paul is the best sign that what we are doing truly is bigger than any one of us .
On behalf of our campaign , I sincerely thank you for everything that you do every single day .
All of us recognize that this political race is not a game .
It will prove to be the most important presidential election of our lifetimes .
Help us continue to repeatedly exceed expectations .

Senator Barack Obama 's concepts are bigger than Obama himself in his run for president , says Frank Luntz , author of Words that Work .
" It 's interesting that people compare him to John Kennedy , " Luntz continues .
" It 's Bobby Kennedy that he 's channeling . "
As Obama 's speeches have drawn audiences of thousands , inspired an R&B song , and attracted the direct attention of opponents from both major parties , one group sticks out in the mind of former GOP strategist and pollster Luntz :
The 18 - 21 demographic .
Luntz enthusiastically predicts :
Said voting bloc , newly energized , will drop their overpriced coffee beverages , take out the earbuds from their MP3 players to hear Obama speak , and show up at the polls on Election Day to vote .

War suicides give us ' window ' into culture of corruption David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday October 22 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This New York Times columnist Frank Rich called in to MSNBC's Morning Joe program to discuss how the recent suicide of US Air Force official Charles Riechers -- just two weeks after a Washington Post piece exposed his acceptance of a phantom job with a defense contractor -- is part of " long hangover of shame " that will continue as an intangible cost of the war in Iraq .
Rich 's Sunday column in the Times described Riechers ' suicide as a " window into the culture " of corruption scandals within the Iraq war .
" You know , it 's sad , it 's tragic because as I wrote about it in the piece , there have now been several suicides of , you know , people in the military who I think earnestly and patriotically want to serve their country , but got caught up in all this money , " Rich told host Joe Scarborough .
" I mean , we know that for instance , there was $ 9 billion , almost all of it in American cash ... that was given to the provisional occupation authority under [ Director L. Paul ]
Bremer that just disappeared .
Like something out of a gangster movie . "
Rich went on to say that those who had focused exclusively on connections between Vice President Dick Cheney and the Halliburton company , which Cheney previously ran , had " neglected to realize there are many , many more contractors there and everyone sort of , a lot of people are sort of stealing everything that 's not nailed down . "
Other suicides , too , can be linked to corruption in Iraq , according to Rich .
" The Wall Street Journal on Saturday had this story of another suicide , not mentioned in my piece , of an American officer involved in food distribution where it looks like a billion dollars or so of money that was used to buy , you know , food for the troops was ripped off , " said Rich .
The columnist also cited the case of Col .
Ted Westhusing , who shot himself in the head while working for top Iraq General David Petraeus .
" This is a guy who taught at West Point , was an army ethicist , as well as an officer , and he saw so much corruption around him , " Rich said , noting that Westhusing himself was not corrupt .
Scarborough quoted from a presumed suicide note from the colonel , with which Rich closed his latest column : " I can not support a mission that leads to corruption , human rights abuse and liars .
I am sullied . "
" I mean , what is this saying about this mission , " said Rich , " when you have people like this , not only taking their own lives but leaving this as their parting words ? "

Also , every ten lines or so please tag things out of the code explaining very very breifly what is happening .
Rada 's story
Seven - year - old Rada is from Moldova - the poorest nation in Europe with 75 % living beneath the poverty line .
Poor housing and high unemployment fuels family breakdowns , leaving many children neglected .
Rada , whose parents were alcoholics , is one of the few children taken into foster care .
The alternative was an outdated orphanage .
All right : Blackwater and other contractors have four BILLION dollars in US funds and , the New York Times reports today , almost no oversight in Iraq ; wildfires are consuming acres of Southern California and many counties have been declared to be in a state of emergency -- and nothing at all but a whisper of popular opposition and a prayer -- nothing legal -- would prevent Bush today from declaring that the National Guard is overstretched and that it is Blackwater 's torturers and murderers , recruited from Salvadoran , Ecuadoran and Nigerian paramilitaries , who will be ' maintaining order ' in the ' public emergency ' that is Southern California ; and Mukasey has informed Congress that he has no idea what waterboarding is -- which professed cluelessness alone should disqualify him from service -- and that the President does not actually need to obey the law of the United States of America -- which alone should alert us that if he is confirmed the game is over .
Once Congress confirms someone to decide the law of the land who holds that the President is exempt from the law of the land ( which assertion was , notably , an historic tipping point when Hitler asked his Reichstag to confirm a similar position about his powers in regard to the law and the constitution ) it is open season on all of us .
It is time to take to the streets .
Many of you have asked about a national strike .
This is the next step in a democracy movement .
We need to hold monthly strikes -- a word that is too scary for some , and we want to be inclusive , so rather we will urge people of all walks of life to participate in mass - action Constitution Days .
What will we do -- in our millions , hopefully , we will Sit Down for the Constitution in the most public space in our communities .
The seated mass citizen action is more effective now than a march ; less cause for confrontation , more family - friendly , you can gather more people for a longer time and it can be more of a community affirmation of American values and the Rule of Law .
Daniel Ellsberg , whom I had the honor of meeting last week in Berkeley , along with his brave and beautiful wife Patricia , reminded me that it took only three days of a widely observed National Moratorium to strike a real blow to the war in the Vietnam .
We propose that local citizens organize these Constitution Days once a month , on the 6th , starting Nov. 6 ( before or after you vote ) .
We suggest that those who can refrain from going to work or to school -- use the time to be with your fellow citizens at the event or reading about democracy and sharing those ideals with your friends and neighbors .
Those who can't leave work , come for lunch hour .
If millions join the nation will react , and even if the first few are small , we must begin .
You guys have to organize these locally -- we can't .
But that is powerful .
Here is how to proceed :
The Liberty Kit for Constitution Days : Assemble a Powerful ' Sit Down For the Constitution ' Citizen Action November 6 and Monthly Thereafter
1. Locally , a volunteer should set up a website announcing the time ( start at noon , stay till five ; you will have most visitors between twelve and two ) .
The place should be the steps of the Town Hall or the most obvious civic space ( in Chicago for instance everyone said Fenwick Park ) .
Send a press kit to all local media outlets -- you can get the resources in the library or online .
If you do n't get coverage you can write to local advertisers of your local news and newspapers -- cc the ad department of the media outlets -- that you will stop buying their products and will urge others to do so as well unless they encourage local media to cover this local important news .
Barbara Martinez who started at sitdownfortheconstitution.org provides a central space -- send an email to the site after you event so we can get an accurate nationwide count of participants .
2 . Ask all to wear red , white or blue t shirts or sweaters and dark slacks .
A strong visual is more likely to get wide press coverage and a good color photo on the cover of a news section of local news .
It is an even better visual if you arrange people into red , white and blue sections .
That will inspire wide angle shots from a higher position .
Protests from progressives always seem visually disorderly -- making coverage less likely -- and a visually orderly , peaceful set of groups also makes it harder for police to crack down violently on protesters after accusing them of misconduct .
3 . Have people bring uniformly sized US flags -- tell them a good local or internet source -- or buy a lot and sell them there .
It reinforces that this is pure support for the American system , not partisanship .
( And it is a bad media image to taser people supporting the flag . )
We want to send a clear message that this is above all a patriotic , transpartisan action on behalf of our fournders ' vision .
People should not wave the small ones , but rather good - sized ones that will blow in the breeze ( again , visuals and media attention ) -- 2Å ~3 at least .
Signs should be in red , white and blue and uniform : ' Moms for the Constitution ' , ' Vets for the Bill of Rights ' ' Teachers for Liberty ' ; ' Americans Don't Torture ' ' The Constitution Keeps us Safe ' ' Stand Up for the Founders ' .
Important are : ' Independents for the Constitution ' ' Swing Voters for the Constitution ' and ' Republicans for the Constitution ' and ' No President is Above the Law ' .
Signs should NOT address unrelated issues -- veganism , Palestine or Israel , patriarchy -- the left tends to let a chaos of messages dilute the force and inclusiveness of one strong message .
The civil rights marches were always disciplined in focusing only on civil rights , for instance .
4. Encourage soldiers and vets to sit down for the Constitution in uniform .
Give them the names of good local pro bono lawyers to call if they face reprisals .
Publicize the reprisals .
5. Distribute copies of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Let people download them from the website .
6 . Have people bring guitars , musical instruments and sing .
Let ordinary citizens lead the singing from a microphone .
For some mysterious reason , protests swell and move people when there is singing , but depress and dispirit people when there are only speeches or angry chanting .
The civil rights movement sang .
The contemporary left speechifies .
So sing .
Create a Constitution Songbook you distribute -- with patriotic songs ' words and folk songs ( this land is your land ) that are widely loved -- often protests have some v left band that alienates others not so left -- people want to feel included across the political spectrum .
Have the words of the Star Spangled Banner , My Country ' Tis of Thee etc -- as well as inspirational songs that are inclusive -- in the songbook .
It is hard to engage in mass arrests against people singing the national anthem .
7 . Have people also bring sleeping bags and folding chairs , food and drink and children .
Encourage people to bring food to share informally -- it is a community pot luck in honor of Liberty .
You can set up folding tables where people bring their food to share across race , class and party lines .
People feel disconnected and powerless after random protest meetups .
You want to foster community and let people find each other as local patriots and build bonds that make other kinds of action possible .
8 . Invite local clergy of all faiths to sit down for the Constitution in their religious garb .
Ask local clergy of many faiths to bless the gathering in their many voices from their many different faith traditions , thus reminding us that this is a pluralistic society ( and making it hard to dismiss protests as hostile to mainstream values ) .
9 . There can be periods of quiet or people simply playing their own music as an offering to the community during the Sit Down for the Constitution .
Have children give five minute talks or read essays of ' What America Means to Me . '
Have ONE lawyer who speaks ENGLISH explain every hour on the hour just what the Bill of Rights means to ordinary people .
Endless speechifying exhausts people .
You are there to be witnesses and to encounter one another as citizens .
Have ONE table where local literature about activism is displayed and have people wear name tags that identify them by name and also by resource or skill or organization that they can contribute to saving democracy .
Let them find one another .
Give priority to vets or military men and women to speak very personally about what liberty and the Bill of Rights means to them -- the values they wish to uphold .
10 .
At the end of the vigil , create a massive circle and light a million candles and ask everyone to take the AFC pledge to protect the Constitution .
Say it together : it is powerful to hear the sound of a multiplied voice .
Go home in a broad stream holding your candles -- another great visual for the cameras .
Meet again in a month .
If you want to connect before that in a Citizens ' Home Gathering -- which many people have asked for -- let someone host it in his or her home or in a public space in a restaurant or friendly bookstore / cafe .
Take citizen action out of an impersonal space -- make citizenship human , face - to - face , easy , supportive and effective .

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - U.S. institutional investors pledged at a U.N. summit on Thursday to invest $ 10 billion over two years in technologies that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to pressure companies to disclose their risks associated with climate change .
The plan “ reflects the many investment opportunities that exist today to put a dent in global warming pollution , build profits and benefit the global economy , ” said Mindy Lubber , the president of Ceres , a coalition of investors and environmental leaders , and director of the Investor Network on Climate Risk .
The California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , the largest U.S. pension fund , and the state treasurers or comptrollers of 11 U.S. states and other players agreed at the investor summit on climate risk to invest the money in green technologies like solar and wind power .
The INCR has been joined by a growing number of investors as the United States , the only major industrialized country that has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5 percent from 1990 levels by 2012 , has become increasingly isolated on climate change policy .
The group also urges companies to divulge such emissions and warns them that climate change could hurt them through shareholder activism .
Florida ’s chief financial officer , Alex Sink , was one of the new players to embrace the green investments .
Florida ’s Gov. Charlie Crist , a Republican , pledged last year to cut carbon emissions .
Sink told reporters that some companies in Florida , a low - lying state at risk from flooding induced by climate change , were happy the state was joining the efforts .
“ Others were stunned and did n’t know how to react . ”
John Sweeney , the president of the AFL - CIO , a federation of unions , told the summit that some of the $ 5 trillion of union workers ’ retirement funds should be invested in ways that help fight climate change .
“ These deferred wages of working people are the capital that can fuel the energy economy of the future , ” he said .
Some analysts have said green technologies like solar power , ethanol and biodiesel are forming an investment bubble that could soon pop .
Lubber said it was up to individual investors to make the right choices in green investing .
“ Calpers has some of the best money managers out there , ” she said .
“ Without question they are calculating those kinds of consequences . ”
Jan. 16 , 2008  --
One hour after his plea for more Saudi oil was publicly rejected by the kingdom's oil minister , President Bush made a private visit to Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah to again ask him to open the spigots .
The White House revealed Bush 's private meeting with the Saudi monarch to reporters aboard Air Force One as the president flew to Egypt on the next leg of his Mideast trip .
Earlier Tuesday , Bush made his case for having OPEC , and particularly American ally Saudi Arabia , increase oil production as the price of gas hovers around $ 3 a gallon .
The Saudi oil minister , however , waited only a short time before announcing that oil prices would remain tied to market forces — a direct slap at Bush .
The president went over the head of the oil minister and made his case to King Abdullah and White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said the private conversation may have yielded some daylight in the Saudis ' hard - line stance .
" The king says that he understands the situation .
He 's worried about high oil prices and how they can negatively affect economies around the world , " Perino said aboard the presidential jetliner .
" The president said there 's a hope that as a result of these conversations that OPEC would be encouraged to authorize an increase in production … to help deal with the tight supply problems in this time when we have growing economies across the world , especially in China . "
Earlier , Bush told ABC News ' Terry Moran how he would lobby the king .
" I will say to him that , ' If it 's possible , your majesty , consider what high prices are doing to one of your largest customers , ' " Bush said .
" In other words , the worst thing that can happen to an oil - producing nation is that the price of oil causes the economy to slow down , because that will inevitably lead to fewer purchases [ of oil ] . "
Bush said he 's worried about an economic slowdown in the United States and around the world because of those high oil prices .
" These are smart people .
They know that the price of oil can affect our economy , and they know that if our economy weakens and there 's less purchasing power , that it will affect their ability to sell barrels of oil , " the president said .
Perino added , " This is not a situation that 's going to be solved overnight , and that 's why on a parallel track the president has been pursuing aggressively alternative and renewable forms of energy . "
When Bush ran for the White House in 2000 , he said he would " jawbone " America 's Saudi allies to lower the price of oil .
The price of oil has hit a record of $ 100 a barrel , but has slipped to a current price of $ 91 a barrel on fears that the U.S. economy is headed for a recession .
New York Sen. Hillary Clinton took a shot at Bush 's requests to the Saudis during the Democratic debate in Nevada Tuesday night .
Referring to his pleading , she called the tactic " pathetic . "

I 've been pondering a type that 's so mind - bogglingly weird that I can no longer think about it without frying my neurons .
So instead I 'll just dump the contents of my brain here so you can fry your neurons too .
Here 's an interesting type to warm up with .
In Haskell : At first look it seems not be well - founded in the sense that a value of type X is a list of X's and we have n't yet defined what X's are .
But we do n't need an X to make an empty list of X's .
So we can build elements inductively starting with Tree [ ] .
If you think of Tree [ ] as being a leaf , you can see why I called this type Tree ( though they are trees whose limbs can have infinite sequences of children ) .
Even without the empty set forming a ' foundation ' we can still build circular elements likeNow lists are ordered and can have repeated elements .
What about if we eliminate these two properties .
The way to do that would be with a set type .
So how do we represent sets in Haskell .
Well certainly not with Haskell 's Data .
Set because that only represents finite sets .
On approach to supporting infinite sets is to identify a set with a predicate for telling whether an element is a member of a set .
In other words , the type X→Bool makes a tolerably good set of X's .
So now we 're ready for an interesting type : ( BTW U stands for universe ) .
The first thing to think about is what this might mean mathematically .
Well it looks like a solution to the equation X=2 , in other words , a set that equals its own power set .
We know that in set theory this gives rise to Russell 's paradox .
One way to embed recursive types into set theory is to tweak set theory , for example by using non-well - founded set theory .
But Russell 's paradox is so bad that it breaks just about any attempt at devising a set theory where a set can equal its power set .
And yet we can build this type in Haskell .
How come ?
The explanation is simple , Russell 's paradox tells us that there must be some elements whose evaluation does n't terminate .
In fact , we can replay Russell 's paradox directly in Haskell .
But before that we need some definitions .
Firstly , are we sure we can even construct an element of U ?
In order to define an element of U we need to define a boolean predicate on U but we can't even compare two elements of U for equality .
But we can define the ' empty ' element phi , along with a membership test :
Unlike conventional set theory , we can define negation of elements .
We can also define union and intersection :
We 're ready for the Russell paradox .
Define the ' set ' ( I give in , let 's informally call these things sets ) of all sets that do n't contain themselves .
Now try to compute nonSelfContaining `e` nonSelfContaining .
It does n't terminate .
It 's not just a matter of having implemented it badly , it can't possibly terminate as there is no answer that could make sense .
So if you 're designing a language that 's intended to be total , you 'd better rule out types like U.So we now have two elements of U , phi and neg phi .
Can we make any more ?
Well here 's one way : Intuitively , c a is the set of all sets that contain a .
But there are two potential problems that come to mind with this .
One is , we 've only made two sets so far , so " the set of all sets that contain a " might not be interesting .
And secondly , can we be sure c a is distinct from a ?
The first issue is easily dismissed .
neg phi is obviously in c phi , but phi is n't .
So we can distinguish phi and c phi .
c phi is also different from neg phi ( check to see if phi is an element of each ) .
In fact , define functional power byand it can be shown that c^m phi is distinct from c^n phi for m≠n .
( Hint : Try checking to see if c^m ( neg phi ) is an element of c^n phi for various m and n. )
So we have constructed an infinite number of elements of U.But , we know that we can write code for elements of U that does n't terminate .
Why not restrict ourselves to just the computable elements of U ?
But there 's a catch .
How do we define a computable element of U when elements of U are functions .
One approach is this : define x to be computable if y `e` x is computable for all y .
But that wo n't do because it wo n't terminate if y is n't computable .
So how about defining x to be computable if y `e` x is computable for all computable y.
But that 's circular , and not in a nice inductive way .
U is so perverse that just attempting to define computability for it gives a circular definition .
But that 's not necessarily a problem .
Define a ' universe ' to be a set , C , of computations of type U such that C = the set of x such that y`e` x terminates for all y in C .
The question now is this : is there a unique set C satisfying this ' equation ' .
We can rule out the empty set as phi must be in any such C .
There 's also another thing we can prove .
If we have two such sets , C and C ' , we can prove that the intersection of C and C ' is a universe .
So we can take the intersection of all universes to form the smallest universe .
So we can define a something in U to be computable if it is in this smallest set .
So here 's my first open question :
Are there larger ' universes ' than the smallest one , or is it unique ?
It 's not hard to see that a universe is closed under ( non-recursive applications of ) negation , finite union , finite intersection and the function c above .
My second open question :
What other computable elements are there ?
Time to stop this and start cooking dinner .

When the stock market hits a rough patch after a long Bull Market , it might cause you to think “ Should I get out of the stock market ? ” and “ What should I do with my money ? ”
The answer is it depends .
Every year , you should be evaluating your needs and adjust your investment strategy to fit those needs .
Personally , I still have two more decades to go , so I am holding steady and continuing to invest for the long - term .
Putting Things in Perspective
If you are reading this because the stock market just crashed big time and you ’re thinking about selling to get out of the market … DON’T !
The best thing you can do right now is to do NOTHING .
Wait and evaluate .
Here is the S&P 500 Historical Return with the last three MAJOR STOCK MARKET CRASHES highlighted .
As you can see , the Stock Market will go up over the long run .
How to Build an All - Weather Portfolio
I believe these four steps will help you build a profitable long - term investment portfolio :
1. Risk Tolerance Level
Have you taken one of those risk tolerance tests ?
Did you get a rating like “ aggressive investor ” or “ very aggressive investor ” ?
Maybe it is time to take another test to see if you still feel the same way you did back when you first took one .
Your life situation and financial priorities could have changed — e.g. , you got married , you bought a house , you gave birth to a child , etc .
Now is probably a good time to re-evaluate your risk tolerance level — it ’s normal for your risk tolerance profile to change with time .
Understanding your current risk tolerance level and where you stand is a good place to start .
2. Investment Time Horizon
Even if you are still optimistic and your risk tolerance level still says you are an “ aggressive investor , ” you now have a shorter investment time horizon .
As you get closer to your retirement age , you should consider shifting more of your investment portfolio away from stocks toward less volatile investments that focus more on generating income .
3. Asset Allocation
Does your asset allocation align with your risk tolerance level and investment time horizon ?
If you have been religious about rebalancing your portfolio , but have n’t changed your allocation for a while , this may be an excellent time to take a good look at it .
Here is an Asset Allocation Calculators from CNNMoney.com to help you with your allocation .
Does your current investment mix in line with the ideal asset allocation ?
As you can see , two investors with the same Risk Tolerance , but different Investment Time Horizon has very different recommended allocation .
4. Diversification
Does your investment consist mainly of individual stocks ?
If it does , I recommend that you read Wise Investing Made Simple : Larry Swedroe ’s Tales to Enrich Your Future by Larry Swedroe .
Larry believes that the best investment strategy is to be a disciplined , long - term , buy - and - hold investor that utilizes a globally diversified portfolio of low - cost , no-load , and passively managed funds and ETFs .
I also believe in this strategy .
In short , invest in funds and ETFs instead of individual stocks
Now let ’s take it a step beyond the typical diversification when we think about investment — i.e. , stock vs. bond , large - cap vs. small - cap , domestic vs. international , value vs. growth , etc .
Do you have other types of investments that are generating alternative income , or appreciating in value ?
For example :
Business
Real estate
Precious metal and gems
Debt instruments
Do you believe your investment portfolio is diversified ?
What to Do Before a Stock Market Crash
If you follow the steps above and you can hold your investments through a crash , you could simply wait it out and let the market recover .
However , if you ’re still nervous , you could make some additional adjustments to your portfolio to help ease the pain when the market eventually crashes .
1. Tactical Asset Allocation ( TAA )
If you expect the Stock Market to perform poorly , you could temporarily shift your investment away from Stocks .
Let ’s say your desired asset allocation is 75 % Stocks , 23 % Bonds , and 2 % Cash ; you could shift your allocation toward Bonds and Cash .
For instance , your temporary asset allocation could be 55 % Stocks , 38 % Bonds , and 7 % Cash .
Your portfolio is likely to have a lower rate of return if the market continues to climb .
However , you would be in a much better position to take advantage of the market recovery with your larger bonds and cash positions .
2. Invest in Dividend - Paying Stocks
There is a consensus that dividend - paying stocks tend to do better in Bear Markets .
The theory goes as follow :
Dividend - paying companies tend to be more established companies with proven positive cash flow ( that ’s how they can afford to pay dividends ) .
When the stock market crashes , the prices for these stocks go down as well , but their dividend yields go up .
As their yields increase , this will attract investors seeking higher yields to buy these stocks .
Secondly , dividend payments you receive during the down market allows you to buy more shares to average down your cost basis .
To help prepare your portfolio , you could shift some of your investments toward dividend - paying stocks .
3. Sector Investing
The theory behind sector investing is simple .
There is historical evidence that shows certain sectors do better than others in different phases of the economy .
You could adjust your portfolio to take advantage of the economic cycle .
Here is an illustration from Fidelity ’s article : Sector investing using the business cycle .
If you agree with the Sector Investing approach , then you could over - weighing your portfolio toward Materials , Consumer Staples , Health Care , Energy , and Utilities ; while under - weighing Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology .
4. Switch from Mutual Funds to ETFs
ETFs are much more tax - efficient than equivalent mutual funds .
When the stock market crashes , investors invariably sell in panic .
When a mutual fund is sold , the fund manager must sell the underlying securities to raise cash to meet that redemption .
This creates capital gains that must be paid out to shareholders at the end of the year .
If you have mutual funds in your taxable account , you could be stuck with a tax bill you did n’t deserve .
On the other hand , ETFs are bought and sold like stocks .
This means there are no capital gains to worry about .
What to Do After a Stock Market Crash
Okay … the market took a dive , now what should you do ?
1. Keep Investing
I invested through two major crashes so far — and they were BIG ones .
Each time , all I did was keep adding more money to my portfolio .
I did n’t panic and took out all my money .
No , I kept it exactly where it should be…fully invested .
At the same time , I continued to contribute to my 401 ( k ) plan as if nothing happened .
Personally , I feel this is the best strategy to invest through market crashes , corrections , and volatile markets .
2. Rebalancing
If you follow the asset allocation strategy , a market crash should present an opportunity for you to rebalance your portfolio .
This action will let you shift some money from investments that held up well , to investments that went down substantially .
Although it might not be as appealing as rebalancing in the Bull Market , it accomplishes the same objective — buy low and sell high .
3. Tax Loss Harvesting
If you have investments in a taxable account , this is the best time to look at your investments to see if any asset has an unrealized loss .
This might be a good time to sell these assets to realize the losses , which you can deduct against capital gains and up to $ 3,000 of your normal income .
Just be sure to replace it with another investment so that you do n’t miss out on the gain when the market recovers .
Also , be sure to avoid the wash sale rule .
Read More : Tax Loss Harvesting Examples and Wash Sale Rule
4. Reassess Your Asset Allocation
If you utilize Tactical Asset Allocation or Sector Investing strategies , you should reevaluate if you have the right investment mix after the market crash .
If you feel that the market will start to recover , then you should adjust your asset allocation to reflect the new market and economic conditions .
Bottom Line
You should not let emotion drive your actions .
It is not a good idea to check the stock market daily and react to every up and down .
Ultimately , the worst thing you can do is panic sell right after the stock market crashes .
If you are feeling nervous about the current market condition , consider implementing some of the strategies above to help you prepare for a stock market crash .
Always have an investment strategy and stick to it !

President Bush 's proposed 2009 budget has raised many eyebrows , and also no doubt the blood pressure of many readers of this space .
Most notable is the staggering $ 410 billion deficit , which does n't even include the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , which we will charitably price at $ 150 billion , making the grand total $ 560 billion .
George Bush , the first ' CEO president , ' must no doubt be wringing his hands over how to cover such a massive sum .
After all , any private corporation or individual can't very well spend more than they earn without going into debt , which every red- blooded American naturally finds abhorrent .
Bake sales are the stalwart of churches , school bands , and Boy Scout troops that are a little short of cash .
Honoring this venerable tradition , I have come up with two related proposals , either of which will solve the problem of how to fully fund the 2009 budget without running a deficit .
Each plan has its respective strengths and weaknesses , which are analyzed below .
Plan A : Federal Employee Bake Sale
The federal government employs 1.8 million people , plus 800,000 in the Postal Service .
The untapped potential of such a vast army of workers could be harnessed to vanquish the deficit in short order .
Spreading out the $ 560 billion equally among these 2.6 million workers amounts to a piddling $ 215,380 each .
Pricing a cookie at 50 cents , a brownie at $ 0.75 , and a muffin at $ 1.25 , each federal employee could sell 430,760 cookies , 287,173 brownies , or 172,304 muffins to cover their share .
Of course for variety 's sake , one could instead sell some combination of cookies , brownies , and muffins that totals $ 215,380 .
( Alternatively , the average federal worker could simply sell their house and give the money over .
With the median house price now at $ 217,000 , you would even have a little cash to spare ! )
Now , the keener economists among us will immediately point out the practical implications of putting this plan into action .
Namely , one could expect the ensuing run on supermarkets to produce an immediate shortage of flour , sugar , eggs , vanilla , and butter .
The ensuing panic would result in Katrina - like conditions in which the National Guard and Blackwater USA are deployed to quell the riots that 2.6 million angry federal workers would cause in their struggle to obtain enough baking powder and chocolate chips .
The added expense of all the rubber bullets and tear gas would just add to the deficit , I 'm afraid .
Besides , a bag of flour is no good if it 's been soaked by a water cannon , rendering it a pasty sack of mush .
Let 's momentarily cast aside any petty worries over civil unrest and carry on with our analysis .
After the initial stock of baking supplies vanishes from store shelves , we can expect the price of these commodities to skyrocket , sending flour to something in the range of $ 750 a bag , and likewise $ 420 for a bag of sugar .
Individual chocolate chips might be sold for $ 50 - each !
However outrageous this may seem , all is well in the eyes of the economist , as the market has quickly adjusted prices to accommodate the sudden jump in demand .
However , as we all know too well , state and local governments would likely intervene to prosecute ' price gougers , ' decrying those profiteering off of butter and baking soda .
Imagine scenes of supermarket managers being ' perp - walked ' in front of the television cameras for everyone to see !
In a travesty of justice , lengthy sentences would be dished out for these heroic entrepreneurs , who were only trying to rationally distribute scarce goods .
In light of the economic calamity that would befall us if Plan A were to be implemented , I suggest we follow the second of my plans :
Plan B : The White House Bake Sale
Since this is Bush 's budget , let him make up the deficit himself !
After all , Andrew Jackson nearly paid off the national debt in 1835 !
At $ 9.21 trillion , the current federal debt is over 16 times greater than the projected 2009 deficit , so we 're actually taking it pretty easy on the ol ' Decider .
Instead of making poor George bake hundreds of thousands of cookies , brownies , and muffins , driving the price of butter to $ 100 per stick , etc. , let 's limit ourselves to a more reasonable array of baked goods .
In a single afternoon , George could probably knock off 200 cookies , 100 brownies , and 50 muffins .
Now , under our old pricing scheme , this bake sale would bring in a haul of $ 237.50 , leaving us exactly $ 559,999,999,762.50 short of the goal .
Regrettably , prices will have to be raised to compensate for this drastically smaller bake sale .
Accordingly , each cookie will now cost $ 43,076 , each brownie $ 64,614 , and a muffin will run you $ 107,690 .
Understandably , most off us might have a hard time coughing up the loose change to afford even a small bite of a single cookie .
Fortunately , we can finally make the Federal Reserve 's inflation machine work for us !
The Great Inflator himself , Ben ' Helicopter '
Bernanke , can quickly whip us up some extra money and shower us in a tsunami of greenbacks !
In this way , the deficit practically pays for itself with new money that nobody had to actually work for .
The deficit is zapped , safely monetized , and forgotten about .
A very worried and fretful George Bush can finally declare himself to be the fiscal conservative he aspired to be way back in 2000 .
He 'll surely sleep better at night , knowing that at last the budget is balanced and sound .
Going back through history , I remember when the “ War on Crime ” began , and that was almost thirty ( 30 ) years ago .
Then came the “ War on Drugs , ” and now approximately 1 in every 31 adults in the United States is behind bars or under court supervision .
Why are we so cruel to our own people ?
LINK
Now that the “ War on Terror ” is being expanded , and the Senate is getting ready to pass S 1959 , its apparent the government is now starting a new “ War ” - and this one is aimed squarely at anyone and everyone that does n’t agree with a government that dances to the tune of corporations and special interest groups rather than the people themselves .
Now that Congress has ample evidence to successfully impeach George .
W. Bush and Vice - President Dick ( Darth ) Cheney , and they still refuse to uphold the Constitution and protect the people they pledged to serve in their oaths of office , the people know that Congress is complicit in the destruction of democracy , instead opting for the money and / or acting in cowardice and fear as fascism is rapidly taking - over the governance of the United States .
The facts that have been released to the mainstream news media these last few days have been damning for the Bush administration , and even more evidence of criminality is available on the Internet for all to see ; however , you in Congress must take note that President Bush has lied to a nation , and now we know that the recent NIE was only released because several senior intelligence analysts were willing to go to jail in order to insure that the people of America and the world community were apprised of the truth , not what Bush and Cheney were attempting to coerce them to say .
LINK
When the President and Vice - President have flagrantly broken our laws and commit “ high crimes and misdemeanors ” , it is the duty of the Congress , not whether you “ decide ” to impeach or not .
The constitution is very clear on that matter , and when an administration is flagrantly guilty of several crimes , the Congress in compelled to impeach , not decide beforehand whether they feel it will win or lose .
The Congress would do well to understand the meaning of “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” and the argument of whether those herein cited are applicable under the actual definition of this phrase in our constitution is necessary for all to know and understand ; most of the public believe “ High Crimes ” are felonies and crimes of such magnitude that Congress has to have an iron - clad case to bring the matter to the House of Representatives for arguments and evidence ;
Nothing could be further from the truth !
To hear arguments that Bush has n’t committed a crime that falls into this category is patently false and those who use such frivolous arguments against impeachment would do well to understand exactly what it entails :
The Constitution says a President can be impeached for “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” but it does n’t define the term .
Who decides what that means ?
Columbus , Ohio - 5/3/00
The Congress decides the definition : by majority vote in the House for impeachment , and by 2/3 vote in the Senate for conviction .
The Framers of the Constitution deliberately put impeachment into the hands of the legislative branch rather than the judicial branch , thus transforming it from strictly a matter of legal definition to a matter of political judgment .
Then Representative Gerald Ford put it into practical perspective in 1970 , when he said an impeachable offense is “ whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history . ”
“ High crimes and misdemeanors ” entered the text of the Constitution due to George Mason and James Madison .
Mason had argued that the reasons given for impeachment — treason and bribery — were not enough .
He worried that other “ great and dangerous offenses ” might not be covered , and suggested adding the word “ maladministration . ”
Madison argued that term was too vague , so Mason then proposed “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” a phrase well - known in English common law .
In 18th century language , a “ misdemeanor ” meant “ mis - demeanor , ” or bad behavior ( neglect of duty and corruption were given as examples ) , while “ high crimes ” was roughly equivalent to “ great offenses . ”
MUCH MORE
This passage I found on AfterdowningStreet .
Org mirrors my feelings , and countless millions of other patriotic Americas that feel the same way .
What the general public does n’t know is that internment camps , concentration camps , or expanded prison capability designed to hold more than a million detainees are being built or renovated in almost every state in the union .
LINK LINK LINK
For the Mainstream News Media to have knowledge of these camps and not ask pertinent questions necessary to awaken the public and warn them of this danger is unconscionable , and they choose to remain silent , pleased that soon their critics may disappear while a public lulled into complacency is enslaved by the people they believed would be their saviors .
“ With the recent NIE report on Iran , it is ever clearer that the administration ’s deceptions have only grown in scope .
If after this Congress still does not take up the call for impeachment , it is itself open to charges of collusion in high crimes against the Republic , ” said Niranjan Ramakrishnan , a political analyst .
Ramakrishnan criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) for pledging ‘ to keep impeachment off the table ’ in an October interview , describing the pledge as ‘ ridiculous ’ and ‘ criminal ’ .
“ To leave unchallenged the deliberate misleading of the country to war , ( and the effort to do the same a second time ) , makes her party a knowing accessory to the same misdeeds , ” he said .

This is a quote from a publication that was written in 2006 , and all of you know that several more crimes have manifested themselves after the publication of these words :
The Military Commission
Act retroactively approved the use of torture to the beginning of the 9/11 Wars .
Congress ’s reaction to the ACLU report in October of 2005 was to pass legislation banning further use of the
Freedom of Information
Act to request documents on current military operations .
We are in a time of extremism , permanent war , and the unilateral manifestation of ethnocentrism and power by
an openly public cabal of people in the U.S. government .
Those in power are set on the U.S. military domination
of the world .
They seem willing to defy the foundational values of the American people to achieve their ends .
We
have no choice but to declare openly our belief in universal human rights and demand the immediate
impeachment of George W. Bush and Richard Cheney and a full accounting of those in their administration .

To reiterate the many crimes of the Bush administration would be a waste of time , as all of you in Congress know they are guilty ; several books have been written on the subject , and now , placing all technicalities to the side , even the class dunce would conclude , based on the mountains of evidence and the necessity to save our country from further war and violence , the immediate necessity to impeach George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , and Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi .
To those Republicans and “ Blue - Dog Democrats , ” and Independent Joe Lieberman , please be advised that the public , whom are awakening at a remarkable rate , are watching those of you whom still defiantly support this President , and to all of you , I say that your continued support of an administration that has been proven to be liars and have spat on our Constitution and Rule of Law is causing the people to wonder if you too are guilty of , or have actively enabled their crimes .
It is time for all of you to awaken to the reality that as a majority , the people of the United States want George Bush and Dick Cheney impeached , and we demand , not ask , that you fulfill your constitutionally mandated duty to impeach these tyrants before they can inflict more damage and embarrassment on the people of America and the world at large .
In regard Nancy Pelosi , we have just learned that in September of 2002 , Nancy Pelosi was one of the “ Gang of Four ” , along with Representative Jane Harmon , who was briefed on the type(s ) of torture the CIA were using to interrogate high value detainees , and none of those four objected at that time .
Ms. Pelosi , knowing that the CIA was actively conducting torture , which is against our own laws as well as the Geneva Convention , failed to object and even though she was apprised the United States was actively breaking US and international law - she chose to remain silent instead of attempting to do everything in her power to rectify the situation .
It is this writer ’s opinion that she abdicated her duty , and in spite of Ms. Harmon ’s recent statement that she could n’t talk about it because :
“ When you serve on intelligence committee you sign a second oath — one of secrecy , ” she said .
“ I was briefed , but the information was closely held to just the Gang of Four .
I was not free to disclose anything . ”

A large proportion of recent immigrants , both legal and illegal , are low - skilled workers and about one - third of those have not completed high school , giving them significantly less education than Americans born in the United States , according to the study , which is based on census data as recent as March of this year .
The survey focuses on public costs associated with the new generation of immigrant workers .
It does not , however , analyze contributions they make by paying taxes and taking undesirable , low - income jobs — an omission criticized by some immigration scholars .
Still , the survey provides a panorama of the effects of immigration since 2000 .
About 30 percent of all immigrants and their children lack health insurance , Mr. Camarota reports , compared with 13 percent of native - born Americans .
One of every three uninsured people in the country is an immigrant or a young American - born child with at least one immigrant parent , he found .
Immigrant families account for almost three - quarters of the increase in the uninsured in the past 15 years , he concludes .
Immigrants are employed at higher rates than Americans , according to the survey .
But because of their low educational levels , many work in low - paying , entry - level jobs that do not provide health insurance or other benefits .
“ Immigrants have had an enormous impact on the lack of health insurance , ” Mr. Camarota said .
“ If we are going to have a debate about health insurance , we should recognize that most of the growth in the uninsured comes from recently arrived immigrants and their American - born kids . ”
NBC reverses course , offers conservatives access to airwaves
For quite a while , it seemed as if the only political ads that were rejected by television networks came from the left .
Last week , for example , Fox News rejected an ad from the Center for Constitutional Rights about the administration ’s torture because , as Bill O’Reilly insisted , the ad was “ anti-American . ”
Last year , NBC refused to run an ad from MoveOn.org about alleged Republican corruption .
Around the same time , all of the major TV networks rejected an ad by the United Church of Christ that told viewers , “ No matter who you are or where you are on life ’s journey , you ’re welcome here . ”
The trend has been discouraging .
In November 2005 , Fox News would n’t run anti-Alito ads .
Not long beforehand , MoveOn.org raised enough money to buy an ad during the Super Bowl , but CBS rejected it , noting its “ long - term policy not to air issue ads anywhere on the network . ”
Just a few weeks prior , CBS and NBC refused advertising from the UCC because the church ’s open , tolerant message of inclusion was labeled “ too controversial . ”
With this background in mind , it came as a bit of a surprise last week when NBC rejected a political ad from Freedom ’s Watch , a right - wing group created to support the White House ’s policy agenda .
NBC has rejected a TV ad by the White House front group Freedom ’s Watch “ because it refers to the group ’s Web site , which the network said was too political . ”
The ad thanks soldiers for their service but also contains a “ welcoming message ” that states : “ For too long , conservatives have lacked a permanent political presence to do battle with the radical special interests groups and their left - wing allies in government . ”
“ We have a policy that prohibits acceptance of advertising that deals with issues of public controversy , ” said Alan Wurtzel of NBC .
As much as I ’m opposed to Freedom ’s Watch , this was n’t exactly welcome news .
I do n’t want the left and right blocked from the public ’s airwaves , I ’d prefer the networks allow both sides to advertise and reach the public .
That said , I was at least mildly encouraged that NBC was being even - handed — the network rebuffed MoveOn.org , a message of tolerance from the United Church of Christ , and the loyal Bushies at Freedom ’s Watch .
Or so I thought .
It did n’t take long for NBC to reverse course and offer the right the access it had denied the left .
NBC reversed course Saturday and decided to air a conservative group ’s television ad thanking U.S. troops .
The ad , by the group Freedom ’s Watch , asks viewers to remember the troops during the holiday season .
NBC had refused to air the ad because it guides viewers to the Freedom ’s Watch Web site , which NBC said was too political .
But in a statement issued Saturday evening , NBC said : “ We have reviewed and changed our ad standards guidelines and made the decision that our policy will apply to content only and not to a referenced Web site .
Based on these amended standards the Freedom ’s Watch ad will begin to run as early as Sunday . ” NBC ’ head of standards and practices , Alan Wurtzel , notified Freedom ’s Watch ’s media consultant Saturday by e-mail , writing : “ This will confirm that the Freedom ’s Watch spot is approved for air . ”
Freedom ’s Watch President Bradley A. Blakeman welcomed the decision .
“ We ’re actually very happy that NBC has agreed to change its position because it will only help the troops be properly thanked , ” he said .
So much for even - handedness .

Desmond Morris is keen on the concept of playfulness , and thinks it tell us a lot about humanity 's evolution .
Our playfulness fuels our ingenuity and inventiveness , allowed us to defeat physically more powerful species to become global top dogs , and explains how we ended up wearing clothes , playing computer games , dropping " smart " bombs and watching Strictly Come Dancing .
We play , therefore we are .
You can't help thinking about Morris 's playfulness theory when you meet him : a large , beaming , soon - to - be - 80 - year - old surrounded by books ( many of which were written by him ) and surrealist paintings ( all of which were painted by him ) in a converted coach house at the back of his rambling home in Oxford - the very house , he tells me at least twice , in which 19th - century lexicographer James Murray laboured for more than 30 years on the Oxford English Dictionary ( he died having got to T ) .
We talk , meanderingly , for three hours ; I 'm knackered by the end , but Morris remains arm - wavingly irrepressible , and only stops because his wife is ill and rings from the house for a cuppa ( we also seem to be ending at tea ) .
Otherwise , I 'd probably still be there .
Morris has just produced The Naked Man , a companion book to The Naked Woman , which appeared in 2004 , and the latest in an evolutionary line stretching back to his career - defining , life - changing , collective - mentality - altering The Naked Ape , an instant bestseller when it was published in 1967 and now heading for sales of 20 m .
He has made a career out of telling us that 10,000 years of " civilisation " cannot offset several million years of hunter - gathering , and that we now live a life that is , in many ways , at odds with our genetic inheritance .
Morris 's theories do not endear him to feminists .
The phrase he uses most often to describe men is " risk - takers " .
He says that for a million years or more men had to go out and face down woolly mammoths and sabre - toothed tigers , develop strategies to overcome them ( cooperation to fight common foes , he emphasises , is genetically more important to man than the competitive urge ) , and " bring home the bacon - literally " , while women cleaned the cave , raised the serial litter that is unique to the human species , and organised every other aspect of life .
His view , anathema to many fellow scientists as well as to feminists , is that this genetic separation can't be wished away by equality legislation .
" There was considerable specialisation for the male and the female , " he says .
" Men became more athletic and did the hunting ; women did everything else .
They were multitasking , to use a phrase that has become very popular , and were at the centre of society .
It 's not a question of superiority and inferiority .
It 's a question of differences , and these differences are very real . "
Men were expendable ; women , because of their reproductive function , were n't .
" You could n't afford to lose a woman , " he says , " They were too valuable , so the males became the specialist hunters . "
For the whole of prehistory , this separation of roles worked well , Morris says - a perfect union designed to rear young and perpetuate the species .
The problem came when we started to expand from our natural tribal groups of around 100 and develop big settlements .
" For a million years , women were at the centre of society and men were on the periphery , " says Morris .
" I do n't see why women get so upset about this : women ran society , men were in the hunting ground .
The sad thing for women is that , over a period of time , the hunting grounds became the city centres , and so instead of being on the periphery , men were now in the centre of the cities running things .
The cities were the hunting grounds , although now the hunting was metaphorical .
Urbanisation favoured the male . "
Feminists could take this two ways .
The upside is that Morris thinks women should run more or less everything .
" We 'd be much better off if women ran most of the organisations , " he says .
" If women ran the political world rather than men , for instance .
I do n't think men are suited to politics .
Women are much more suited because they are genetically more cautious and are not going to make stupid mistakes . "
The downside , feminism - wise , is that Morris thinks that men , because of their natural risk - taking , will always be better inventors and artists .
" For every one great woman artist , there are 100 men , " says Morris .
" There are more male geniuses than female geniuses , and there are more male idiots than female idiots .
If you 're a human female , you can't afford to be a risk - taker and you can't afford to be a dimwit .
You have to be in between those two extremes . "
Man 's artistic dominance , he argues , cannot be explained by opportunity or social conditioning .
Over the whole of evolution , women have produced more art than men - in the form of decorated pottery and clothing - but they have tended to produce traditional art .
It is men who have flouted the rules and produced most of the great , mould - breaking art .
Morris also has a theory about car crashes .
" Women have more accidents but men have bigger accidents , " he says .
" If you 're going to have a big car crash , it 's always a man ; if you 're going to get a dented fender , it 's a woman .
You hardly ever hear of a high - speed crash involving a woman ; it 's always a man . "
He expresses his theory forcefully , vividly ; you sense , anecdotally , that there may be something in it ; but you would also like to see the insurance stats to prove it .
Morris paints with a very broad brush .
The other area where Morris 's new book has already proved controversial is his take on homosexuality .
This is dealt with in the final chapter of the book and feels tacked on , as if the publisher insisted the subject be covered .
Morris has borrowed a theory from his friend and fellow zoologist Clive Bromhall , who in his book The Eternal Child argued that a key feature of our evolutionary history has been the extension of childhood and the postponement of breeding .
The social effect of that process has been that for 10 years , between the ages of about four and 14 , boys and girls have tended to play together in separate groups .
At puberty , the sexes - driven by the need to reproduce - come together , but for largely social reasons ( these are left irritatingly vague ) a small proportion of men and women continue to prefer their own sex .
Homosexuality is " genetically instigated but then environmentally influenced " , he says .
Gay men , he argues , are at the extreme end of the " playfulness " spectrum , and likely to be more creative than the average .
One of the key features of humans , according to his overall theory , is that unlike other species we never lose the curiosity and inventiveness of youth .
Homosexual people , he says , exhibit that " Peter Pan syndrome " to an extreme degree , giving them above - average intelligence , inventiveness and creativity .
The theory , to my untutored ears , sounds tenuous , and for once Morris does n't express it very fluently - he seems embarrassed to be relying on someone else 's thinking .
Morris , a genetically useful iconoclast and provocateur , prides himself on simplifying science for the general reader without distorting , but I wonder about the way these large hypotheses on homosexuality are skipped over in just seven pages of what is effectively a coda to the book .
The Naked Man exemplifies the tensions - and the pleasures - in Morris 's richly varied career .
The book is a long way from The Reproductive Behaviour of the Ten - Spined Stickleback , for which he was awarded his doctorate at Oxford in 1954 .
He could have had a distinguished career as what might be called an institutionalised zoologist - and for much of his time he has had exactly that - but in the late 1950s he fell among that dangerous tribe of television people , joining Granada to make the programme Zoo Time , which taught him how to popularise without dumbing down too much , made him a name and led to him writing The Naked Ape , which treated humans as animals and sought to explain all human behaviour in zoological terms .
Man was not a moral or a spiritual being ; he was an animal , an ape with pretensions to be something greater .
" I spent the first half of my life studying animal behaviour , " says Morris , " and when I eventually wrote a book about human beings , I wrote about them as if I was writing about another animal species .
I had met Tom Maschler , then a young publisher at Cape , at a party and told him I was going to write a zoology of human beings one day , and not even use the term human beings .
Instead I 'd write it as if I was an alien who had come to this planet and seen this extraordinary ape which does n't have any fur on its body .
Tom loved the idea , but it took him three years to persuade me to write it , and when I eventually set to work I had to complete it in four weeks because I was so busy .
I just sat down and wrote .
It was written with such intensity that I can remember it to this day . "
It was a publishing sensation that caught a moment when everything was being rethought : while attractive to radicals , who wanted to strip away layers of political and religious authority and liked the notion of unfettered man , it infuriated feminists , who accused it of promoting a male - centred view of human evolution .
It became a cause celebre - Maschler 's instinct had been spot on - and made zoology part of the late - 60s zeitgeist .
The irony is that Morris was an accidental zoologist .
His first love was art - he intended to be a surrealist painter - and he only applied to study zoology at Birmingham because he had a low opinion of art schools and felt a study of biomorphic shapes would be useful to his painting .
He exhibited in London with Joan Miro in 1950 , but that was surrealism 's last throw in the UK and he realised he would never make a living .
He had , in any case , been bitten by the zoology bug at Birmingham and could n't resist the lure of the ten - spined stickleback .
Morris never stopped painting , though he did n't exhibit between 1952 and 1974 , and his coach house is neatly divided into halves that sum up the two compartments of his life .
" I have a library with all my scientific books and a room with my art books and my paintings , " he says .
" It 's like two hemispheres of my brain . "
Who else , you wonder , could in the mid-1960s have gone from being head of mammals at London Zoo - the job he had been given after the success of Zoo Time - to director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts ?
" From rhinos to Picassos , " as he sums up a wondrously odd move .
He did n't stay at the ICA long .
The runaway success of The Naked Ape allowed him to run away - he says he knew it was a sensation when he heard Burt Lancaster had bought the film rights .
He quit his job and , with his wife Ramona , went to live in Malta , where he started painting again in earnest , lived a life of sunny , self - conscious hedonism , and produced a son , Jason .
Morris was almost 40 when he left for Malta - burned out , he says , after 15 years of frenetic activity .
" A few months before I wrote The Naked Ape my health collapsed .
When I recovered I said , ' Right , that 's it , ' and I cut out a lot of things .
I realised that I had to cut down .
I was trying to live like a machine when in fact I was just an animal .
I focused all my efforts on one thing , which was The Naked Ape .
I sat down and wrote it in the autumn of 1966 .
I had n't any hopes for it ; I did n't expect it to do anything .
People say I must have known what I was doing .
They think I deliberately wrote it to make a shocking bestseller , but it was n't like that . "
Intentional or not , that was what it became , and he was determined to enjoy the money and freedom it brought him .
" I did n't intend to stay in Malta for very long , but it stretched for five or six years .
I had a studio and painted .
I wrote in the winter , painted in the summer .
We had all our friends out to stay .
My childlike curiosity , which I 've maintained all my life , demands new experiences , and this was something I 'd never experienced before .
My mother was horrified .
She said , ' Put the money in the bank , ' as mothers do , but I said , ' No , I 'm going to spend it all , and when it 's all spent I 'll come back to work , because I like work . '
And that 's what I did .
I spent most of it , and then came back and started research again here at Oxford . "
In 1973 he returned to the UK with his family to take up a research fellowship at Wolfson College , seeking to combine hard science with populist books .
The Human Zoo and Intimate Behaviour , both written in Malta , were followed by Manwatching ( which developed the concept of " body language " ) , The Soccer Tribe , Catwatching , Dogwatching and Babywatching .
He resumed his TV career and travelled widely - a map of the world in the corridor that connects his art - world with his science - world is covered with pins marking the places he has visited .
He has clearly had a ball , adores his wife of 55 years , remains fascinated by art and film , and has even come to quite like his fellow humans after early doubts .
An intense only child , he had spent much of his adolescence watching his father die of wounds received in the first world war and , as a teenager confronted with the loss of his father and the start of a second global conflict , he took a dim view of his fellow naked apes , finding solace in art and the natural world .
Regrets ?
" I should have stuck at the art , " he says .
" I think I had the potential to be a good artist .
I still consider myself a serious artist but a very minor one , and I 'm a minor artist because I 've been doing too many other things .
My strength is that I do lots of different things ; my weakness is that I do n't stick at any of them long enough . "
Does he envy David Attenborough , who 50 years ago used to present Zoo Quest on the BBC while Morris did Zoo Time on ITV ?
His TV rival - and good friend - carried on making programmes and remains a vital presence on television , lauded for his commitment to quality broadcasting .
" I 'm not an envious person , " says Morris .
" It 's one of my few good qualities .
David has stuck to his guns , gone right the way through the whole animal kingdom , and made the best programmes about animals ever .
They will be a lasting monument to him .
David has his huge collection of natural history programmes which together make a brilliant study .
I would have liked to have been somebody who had done a major study , but on the other hand I 've had the pleasure of being like a child all my life and having new toys all the time . "
The perfect image of the playful , risk - taking male .
Happiness may lie in having theories that match one 's own personality .

-- Senate Bill 2506 introduced by Senator Kalani English , as well as House Bill 2580 sponsored by Representative Mele Carroll but introduced by Speaker of the House Calvin Say because of quota , will move to ban aspartame from the State of Hawaii .
Senator Suzanne Chun-Oakland also on the team .
Efforts continue to ban this deadly excitoneurotoxic carcinogenic drug that is addicting the public and triggering so many symptoms and diseases from MS and lupus and seizures to Parkinson's , diabetes and obesity and even blindness and death .
An aspartame documentary , Sweet Misery : A Poisoned World , explains how Don Rumsfeld got this marketed when the FDA said no .
http://www.soundandfury.tv/pages/rumsfeld2.html
Masquerading as an additive it's a deadly drug that interacts with other drugs and vaccines .
No one can forget the gallant efforts of Senator Gerald Ortiz y Pino who sponsored the Senate bill to ban aspartame in New Mexico .
One picture that remains in my mind is addressing the Senate with Senators sipping Diet Coke .
Dr. Ken Stoller said " It 's hard to believe we are going to get anywhere with you drinking this but consider the children . "
Aspartame is a teratogen triggering birth defects and mental retardation , reducing IQ , and triggering all types of behavioral and psychiatric problems .
http://www.mpwhi.com/ report_on_aspartame_ and_children.htm
Stephen Fox of Santa Fe , Managing Editor of the Santa Fe Sun News and prime New Mexico moving force behind the legislature efforts to ban aspartame , commented on the great consumer progress implicit in these two bills in Hawaii : " This is wonderful news coming from Hawaii ; the Legislators and their bill drafters saw the merit in keeping almost all of the same language from the 2006 and 2007 New Mexico bills , especially regarding the states ' rights and their obligation to protect citizens health , which are not " preempted " by massive failures at the FDA .
" These New Mexico bills were overwhelmed and eviscerated in New Mexico by some of the most vicious corporate lobbyists I have ever encountered , representing Ajinomoto of Japan , the world 's largest aspartame and MSG manufacturer , as well as their duped American corporate henchmen / colleagues who use massive amounts of Aspartame , like Coca Cola , Pepsi , Altria / Kraft Corporate services , and others .
The same lobbyists will show up in Honolulu , make no mistake ...
" These corporations have everything to lose if such bills advance and ultimately lead to the inevitable product liability and personal injury suits from those damaged by aspartame , which number in the hundreds of millions , despite their cooperate serving propaganda and lies .
" My profoundest appreciation goes to the Hawaii activists who brought up these imperative issues , and to the Legislators who see the merit and need to protect the health of all Hawaiians , no matter what duplicity is perpetuated by the top brass and corporate lackeys at the FDA .
" 47 Members of the UK Parliament have asked for a ban and efforts in New Zealand continue with a circulating petition for ban .
Aspartame was never proven safe .
Here is the Board of Inquiry Report of the FDA that revoked the petition for approval : http://www.mpwhi.com/ fda_petition1.doc

Bush says possible US Iran attack ' empty propaganda ' John Byrne and David Edwards
Published : Sunday October 7 , 2007

In an interview with the Arab language broadcasting network al - Arabiya Friday , U.S. President George Bush called reports of a planned attack on Iran " empty propaganda " and " baseless gossip . "
The al - Arabiya questioned asks Bush about reports in the Arabic press which have alleged the United States has detailed plans to strike military sites in Iran .
" There are some leaking to the press and particularly the Arabic press , " the questioner asks .
" Is it true that you 've issued orders Mr President to your senior generals in the American military to prepare for a major and precise strike that could happen in the middle of January or February . "
" Empty propaganda , " Bush replied .
" Ah , evidently there is a lot of gossip in parts of the country ... the world , that 's trying to scare people about me personally , my country , and what we stand for .
That kind of gossip is just what it is .
It 's gossip .
It 's , uh , baseless gossip . "
According to a New Yorker story last week by veteran intelligence journalist Seymour Hersh , the Bush Administration is all but set to authorize a campaign of limited , surgical airstrikes against Iranian targets .
In his piece , Hersh writes , " During a secure videoconference that took place early this summer , the President told Ryan Crocker , the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq , that he was thinking of hitting Iranian targets across the border and that the British ' were on board ' ...
Bush ended by instructing Crocker to tell Iran to stop interfering in Iraq or it would face American retribution . "
The sites in Iran being targeted , however , reflect the change in the White House 's selling of armed conflict with Iran .
" Instead of ... hitting the various [ nuclear ] facilities we know that exist , instead they 're going to hit the Iranians as payback for hitting us [ in Iraq ] , " Hersh told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer in a recent interview .
Such targets , Hersh says , would include Iran 's Revolutionary Guard headquarters and other sites of Iran 's alleged support for the insurgency in Iraq .
Also Friday , Bush told reporters , " This government does not torture people . "

Purchase an XO Laptop
Almost two years ago , I wrote about the One Laptop Per Child project .
At the time , the goal was to produce fully functional $ 100 laptops for use by poor children in third - world countries .
This admirable project has made quite a bit of progress , even though they had to adjust their price point for the XO Laptop upwards to $ 200 .
And yes ... you CAN purchase an XO Laptop for personal use , or to give as a holiday present this year .
But your window of opportunity is limited .
Starting on November 12 , you can participate in OLPC's " Give 1 Get 1 " program , which is expected to be open to people in North America for about two weeks only .
The program allows you to purchase two XO laptops for US$ 399 -- one for you or your child , and one that will be sent to a child in a developing nation .
To participate in the " Give 1 Get 1 " program , sign up at the XO Giving website , and you 'll receive an email prior to the November 12 launch date .
What is the XO Laptop ?
The $ 200 XO Laptop , meant as an educational tool for the world 's poorest children , is about the size of a textbook , light - weight , power - efficient , and durable .
The distinctive green plastic shell has " ears " on both sides that serve as powerful wireless networking antennas .
Equipped with a 433 MHz AMD processor , one gigabyte of flash memory , and the Linux operating system , this machine is not meant for the geeks , gamers or go - getters in the commercial laptop market .
But it 's an amazing piece of technology that suits the needs of it target audience perfectly .
The 7.5 - inch high - resolution LCD screen swivels like a tablet PC and can be viewed in bright sunlight .
The built in wireless networking allows XO 's to easily share information or an Internet connection .
The efficient power design uses only 2 watts ( 30 times less than typical laptops ) and the XO battery can be recharged with a hand - crank , pull - cord , pedal , solar panel , or car battery when no electricity source is available .
The built - in camera , microphone , speaker and touchpad are integrated into the intuitive visual operating system .
And a software suite that includes a web browser , word processor , multimedia authoring , and programming tools , will empower children to learn and develop skills needed to compete in the information economy .
The XO : Tool or Toy ?
But as I mentioned before , not everyone will want this machine .
With its bright green and white motif , and wireless ears raised , it does look like a child 's toy .
The XO Laptop has no CD / DVD drives , and the kid - sized keyboard may not be well - suited to touch - typing adults .
And perhaps the biggest stumbling block is that the XO currently cannot run Windows software .
But OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte says the group has been working with Microsoft and that support for Windows will come at some point .
Let 's hope they can do so without doubling the price and piling on the bloatware .
It 's worth mentioning that the XO does have some competition , albeit with a twist of irony .
When One Laptop Per Child announced their program in 2005 , Intel 's Chairman Craig Barrett called the device a " gadget " and said it would n't meet the needs of poor children in third - world countries .
His criticism just might have something to do with the fact that arch- rival AMD is the CPU supplier for the XO , and that Intel was faced with the prospect of having nothing to sell to a potential market of two billion people .
Nonetheless , Intel is now offering the Classmate PC , with pricing and specs that are very similar to the XO .
The Classmate has a faster processor , but lacks the alternative power inputs that XO offers .
This XO / Classmate comparison chart has more information on how the two machines stack up .
Any worthy cause will have detractors , and there are some who criticize OLPC for pushing technology over food and clean drinking water .
But Negroponte sees education as the key to getting out of poverty , and the XO laptop as a tool to advance education by quantum leaps .
Would you buy an XO laptop ?
Do you think it 's a good idea ?

For those who do n’t remember the first time , I point out odd , interesting , funny things in other websites ’ code .
Yes it takes some time to put a post like this together , that ’s why it ’s just about a year since the last time .
Enough with the intro , read on for the code .
The Code
WordPress.com
You ’ll notice a comment sure to make any web developer laugh on WordPress.com ’s login page

Curse you , IE ! –>
The guys behind WordPress a while back took the site BrowseHappy under its wing .
WordPress has always been a strong believer in web standards , so this is n’t surprising ( though still amusing ) .
Did you also know that the guys behind it ( Automattic ) do n’t have job titles ?
Unless you consider “ Chief BBQ Taste Tester ” to be a real job title .
Matt , I hope your job does n’t kill you with a heart attack .
Facebook
The geniuses over at Facebook feel the same and put the following on the top of their IE conditionally included stylesheets :

RedHat
RedHat was one of the earlier corporate sites to redo itself into a standards based design .
They have great respect for those who came before them .
In their master css file they have the following tribute as well as a little remark about Netscape 4.x :
/* redhat.com MASTER style sheet a tip of the red hat to Zeldman , Bowman , Meyer , Shea , Cederholm , Newhouse , Holzschlag , and many , many other css and web standards pioneers who have inspired us .
the css , layout and validation status of redhat.com is a work - in - progress .
numerous web - building worker bees are working furiously to correct the bugs , minimize the hacks and validate the code .
stay tuned .

Panic Software
Panic Software has a cool little piece of code for those who browse the product page for Coda ( awesome product btw ) with IE and do n’t have at least version 6.0 :
<!–[ if lte IE 6 ] ><p id =" iewarning " >< img src= " / extras/ripoff/images/ie-warning.gif " alt = " IE Warning " title = " We hear Firefox is nice ! "
/></p>< ![ endif ] –>
I hear it ’s pretty nice too .
Panic also has a comment in the head of their homepage that reads :
<!–
This homepage design is not long for this world .
Enjoy it while you can ! 🙂 –>
Twitter
Twitter ( who redirects to drop the ‘ www ’ btw ) is a very popular service these days .
In their html they mark which server served up the data .
You ’ll see it in the form :
<! – served to you through a copper wire by bennu.twitter.com at 24 Nov 19:08 in 11 ms ( d 0 / r 8 ) .
thank you , come again . –>
Copper eh ?
No fiber in your data center ?
I wo n’t judge , as long as your bandwidth is plentiful .
WordPress.com
Here ’s a bonus from WordPress .
While many analytics programs use a 1px transparent “ tracker gif ” to manage statistics , WordPress did something a little different .
At the very bottom on the left hand side , you can see the face of WordPress analytics in all it ’s tiny glory .
Mozilla
This technically applies to more than just Firefox .
You ’d be surprised to see how many times kungFuDeathGrip is in the code base .
Many Sites using Google Products / Services
Many people have noticed strange Google tags on sites such as :
code <!–googleoff : index– > all <!–googleon : index– > over
This is n’t a “ SEO ” practice , despite some misconception on the web .
This is used by the Google Search Appliance , a product made by Google which many websites use to power their own search engines to tell the engine what to read and what to ignore .
It would n’t be practical for Google to use these “ in the wild ” .
The reason is that spammers could effectively hide an alternate website within those comments .
Google ’s business is based largely on accurate search results .
Spammers have already tried to abuse the css property display : none ; .
This would be even better .
You can find code like this on Apple.com among many other sites .
Webmasters can however optimize their side for AdSense using a technique recommended by Google :
<!– google_ad_section_start –> <!– google_ad_section_end –>
This tells Google to give weight to a certain part of your page when deciding what ad to display on the page .
This is good for cases where you feel other material on your page is influencing the ads and resulting in off - topic ads .
Infrastructure / Platform
Microsoft
Microsoft ‘s offering against Linux and Apache is IIS on Windows .
Which one would expect they themselves use .
What they do n’t tell you is that they also have used Akamai ( with over 25,000 servers ) , which uses Linux .
They have used Akamai for many things like DNS , and caching files .
Rather than “ Powered By Windows Server ” maybe they should append “ hiding behind Linux ” .
Myspace.com
Myspace.com was previously Adobe / Macromedia ’s model customer because it was written in ColdFusion , and said to be the biggest ColdFusion site on the net ( and one of the biggest sites on the net ) .
Many think it still is , but it ’s not .
While many url ’s suggest it might be because they end in .cfm it ’s actually running ASP .
net and has been since aprox , 2006 .
You can confirm this by viewing the headers on some of their pages .
You ’ll see :
X - AspNet - Version : 2.0.50727
MTV.com
MTV.com ‘s site has search powered by a Google Search Appliance .
MTV is also owned by Viacom who sued Google , the parent company of YouTube .
The folks at MTV awesomely admitted the irony during relaunch on their blog .
Global Crossing
Tier 1 networking provider Global Crossing really wants you to know how fast they are .
Doing a trace could turn up something like this :
7 15 ms 13 ms 14 ms COMCAST-IP-SERVICES-LLC.tengigabitethernet1-4.ar5.NYC1.gblx.net [ 64.208.222.58 ] 8 14 ms 13 ms 13 ms tengigabitethernet1- 4.ar5.NYC1.gblx.net [ 64.208.222.57 ]
Yes that ’s right , they use 10 GigE !
Just FYI .

Firefox 2.0
In Firefox 2.0 , go to “ About Firefox ” ( under the help menu for Windows , under the Firefox menu for Mac ) , and click on credits .
You ’ll notice Stephen Colbert .
He wrote it single handedly , but added some other names because he ’s a nice guy .
Bonus : I ’m on the list too .
Above him because I ’m better than him .
That ’s right , I said it .
Handy
Chase
Chase for some reason puts it ’s login form in plain text .
The submit url is https , but it does n’t feel right .
They do have a SSL enabled login page , but for some reason they hide it .
Here it is for those interested :

On the next page is the 2008 US Presidential Candidate Campaign sites …
Cookery classes will be made compulsory in British secondary schools for the first time , the government announced , as the fight against childhood obesity intensifies .
Schools Secretary Ed Balls said 800 cookery teachers will be trained over the next three years , and agreed with health campaigners who say the new policy should have been introduced years ago .
Students aged 11 to 14 will learn to cook for an hour a week for one term .
Currently around 85 per cent of secondary schools have cookery lessons but the new policy , part of a government obesity strategy , requires all schools to be teaching the subject by 2011 .
A recent government study predicted that half the population could be obese within 25 years while experts believe one million children will be overweight in a decade .
Mr Balls said he wanted children to be able to cook simple and healthy recipes .
" I think it is right to act now and maybe we should have acted earlier but we are acting now , " he told BBC television .
" We are preparing people for the future so we can teach our younger people to be healthier adults in the future . "
Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver , who has been involved in a high - profile campaign to improve the quality of school dinners , told the Daily Mirror : " It 's of the utmost importance that all kids learn to cook good food from scratch and shop well . "
Prue Leith , the new head of the government 's program to improve school meals in England , also welcomed the news .
" If we had done this 30 years ago we might not have the ( obesity ) crisis we have now , " the cook , restaurateur and food writer told Radio 4's Today program .
But Clarissa Williams , a spokesperson for the National Association of Head Teachers , said that training had been neglected for so long it would be difficult to implement now .
" Cookers , microwaves , all of the utensils - all of that costs a lot of money , " she told the Today program .

The Name Behind the Number One child 's efforts to find the man whose sperm donation gave him life .
July 10 , 2007  -- Ryan Kramer , 16 , is one of the smartest teenagers you will ever meet .
He 's already skipped ahead four grades and is now a junior at the University of Colorado in Boulder .
He completes math problems that fill - up entire blackboards , just like Matt Damon 's character in the film " Good Will Hunting . "
While math and science problems are a breeze for Ryan , it 's a really basic question that has stumped him for years .
Ryan 's mother , Wendy Kramer , became pregnant with him 17 years ago using sperm from an anonymous donor .
Ryan says he began asking about his father from a very early age .
" I was 2 years old at the time and going through preschool and seeing other kids who had two - parent families .
I approached my mom and said , ' So did my dad die or what ? ' "
In the best way she could , Wendy explained that she did not know his father and that they may never know him because he had been promised anonymity .
Still , when Ryan 's curiosity remained strong a few years later , Wendy suggested that her son write to the sperm bank requesting more information .
Looking for Answers
According to Wendy , " Donors sign up for anonymity .
That 's their choice , but I also honor my child who never signed an agreement with anybody .
The question is , why does a donor 's rights trump the child 's rights every time ? "
All Ryan knew was that his father had been assigned a number , but the sperm bank let it slip that his donor also had fathered other children .
Ryan now believed he had half - siblings … and he came up with a way to find them .
Ryan and his mother started a Web site called the Donor Sibling Registry .
If you know your donor 's number and the bank from which the sperm was procured , you provide the Web site with that information and you 'll find out whether you have any matches .
Thousands of people have found half - siblings and in some cases , the actual sperm donor .
Even though Ryan knew he could have dozens of half - siblings , it would be years before he would make a match , and even then it would not end up the way he wanted .
' Everything Conceivable '
Liza Mundy , a Washington Post writer and author of the book " Everything Conceivable : How Assisted Reproduction Is Changing Men , Women and the World , " said she believed there could be more than 1 million offspring of sperm donors in the world .
" There 's nobody tracking it .
There 's nobody counting , " said Mundy .
Surprisingly , Mundy says , women using donated sperm is not a new idea .
" For more than 100 years , sperm donation has been conducted surreptitiously .
If a couple was suffering from male infertility , they would go to a doctor and he would say , ' Well , here is a solution and do n't say anything to anyone about it . ' "
So is there a limit to the number of children one donor can " father ? "
Scroll through the Donor Sibling Registry and you 'll see some donors who have been responsible for 20 or more births .
Because all of the information on the Web site is put there voluntarily , the actual number for many donors could be much higher .
" There 's no regulation , " Mundy said .
" Some of the banks say we 'll cap it at 10 offspring , but if the pregnancy is not reported — and many times it 's not — then the sperm bank has no way to know whether or not a child has resulted . "
Todd Whitehurst knows of at least seven children born from his sperm donation back when he was a graduate student at Stanford .
He answered an ad in the student paper because he thought it would be a good way to make a few extra dollars , but he also says he did it because he thought it was a nice thing to do .
" I really felt like I could make a difference in people 's lives . "
Whitehurst had a background that many potential parents found appealing .
" I have bachelor 's degrees and master 's degrees in electrical engineering and computer science … then I went to medical school and got an M.D. from U.C. - San Francisco . "
While not the only " father " listed on the Donor Sibling Registry , Whitehurst is in the minority when it comes to donors who want to meet their offspring .
" I do n't think many donors even want to be contacted .
I do n't really understand that .
To me it seems like an amazing opportunity to meet these children that resulted from donations , " he said .
But what about 16 - year - old Ryan Kramer ?
Three years passed between the time he launched the site and his first match .
The mother of two girls contacted Ryan through the site .
She let Ryan know that the same donor who had fathered him was responsible for her two daughters .
However , Ryan 's joy at the news soon ended .
Yes , he learned that these two young girls were his half - sisters , but as far as their mother was concerned he would never get to meet them .
She told Ryan she and her husband had kept the truth of their conception by a sperm donor a secret from the girls and planned on keeping it from them .
Ryan was crushed that a family secret was keeping him from the only other family members he knew he had other than his mother .
Just how long would it be before Ryan made the connection he so desperately wanted to make ?
ABC News will answer that question and will be with Todd Whitehurst as he meets three of his offspring for the very first time on " Primetime . "

The White House has finally admitted that the CIA has waterboarded prisoners in our custody and that President Bush could authorize further use of this tactic in the future .
Waterboarding is clearly against international law running contrary to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
There is also a history of the United States regarding waterboarding as a crime .
In 1901 , an American soldier was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and in 1968 another American soldier was court - martialed for the use of waterboarding .
Our Constitution states that the president shall be removed from office on impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors .
Waterboarding is clearly a high crime .
In just under a year we will have ourselves a new administration and we must never allow another one of our leaders to behave as President Bush has .
Only his impeachment will show the next president that , as a nation , we demand that our leaders follow both national and international laws , while upholding the values this nation was founded on .

WASHINGTON  Federal Reserve policymakers grew increasingly worried about the economy last month , with " several " officials noting there was a very real possibility of an actual downturn , according to minutes of meetings .
The minutes released Wednesday also showed continued concern about inflation , with some Fed officials arguing interest rate cuts may have to be reversed at a quick pace when the economy improves .
" Several participants noted that the risks of a downturn in the economy were significant , " the account of the Jan. 29 - 30 meeting said .
While not using the " R " word , the minutes revealed a gloomy mood at the Fed .
Housing , manufacturing , business investment and the job market all weakened , while financial market turmoil persisted and credit tightened .
There was concern that drops in home and stock prices and general economic uncertainty would lead consumers to substantially pull back .
And slower growth abroad would reduce the lift the economy had received from U.S. exports .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , who repeated last week that he expects the USA to skirt a recession , and his colleagues last month aggressively cut their target for short - term interest rates from 4.25 % to 3 % .
The reduction , which came in two moves in nine days , was the steepest in decades and brought the rate to its lowest in 2 ½ years .
The first action , a three - quarter - percentage - point cut , came a day after Fed officials met via videoconference on Jan. 21 , a government holiday , as financial markets abroad were tumbling .
Policymakers felt an immediate rate cut would show the Fed was determined to " act decisively , " which " might reduce concerns about economic prospects . "
The second cut came Jan. 30 , at the end of a scheduled meeting .
The minutes also revealed for the first time that Fed officials met via videoconference on Jan. 9 , the day before Bernanke gave a speech in which he vowed to " take substantive additional action as needed . "
On inflation , incoming data last month were " disappointing , " but policymakers expected price pressures to ease .
Still ,
Fed officials were mindful that leaving rates low for too long could lead to a buildup in inflationary pressures .
" When prospects for growth had improved , a reversal of a portion of the recent ( rate ) - easing actions , possibly even a rapid reversal , might be appropriate , " the minutes said .
Says National City ( NCC ) chief economist Richard DeKaser , " Once the economy has stabilized , it will not be long thereafter that the Fed will be on a rate - increasing campaign . "
He predicts the Fed will cut rates once more at its next meeting March 18 .
With the economy on the mend , the Fed will start raising rates around the end of the year or the start of 2009 , DeKaser says .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Flattened by the mortgage crunch , a forward - looking gauge of home sales fell further in August to its lowest level in more than six years , a real estate trade group said Tuesday .
The pending home sales index fell 6.5 % in August after dropping a revised 10.7 % in July , the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday .
The index is at its lowest level since its inception in 2001 .
“ ' The volume of activity we 're seeing today is below sustainable market fundamentals because some creditworthy people are trying to buy homes but can't because of the credit crunch . ' ” — Lawrence Yun , National Association of Realtors
Pending home sales are down by 21.5 % compared with a year ago and by 22 % compared with six months ago .
Read the full report .
The few economists who forecast the index had been looking for a drop of about 2.1 % in August .
" This is still absolutely awful , confirming that the existing - homes market is now in freefall , " wrote Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics .
" This is consistent with existing - home sales falling to just 5 million or so , " down 10 % from the latest level and 30 % from the peak .
Sellers still do not realize they must cut prices , said Joel Naroff , president of Naroff Economic Advisers .
Listen to the full interview .
" Fewer contracts were being written because of mortgage availability issues , " said Lawrence Yun , senior economist for the Realtors group .
In August , financing for mortgages dried up and dozens of mortgage providers went under as hedge funds , banks and other investors re-evaluated their portfolios of mortgage - backed securities .
" The volume of activity we 're seeing today is below sustainable market fundamentals because some creditworthy people are trying to buy homes but can't because of the credit crunch , " Yun noted .
The trade group said an informal survey of Realtors showed 10 % of sales contracts in August fell through at the last minute because of canceled mortgage commitments .
In some areas , 30 % of contracts fell through .
However ,
Yun said he expected home sales would better reflect the fundamentals by the end of the year .
" We do n't want to suggest that housing activity has found a bottom , but we do think it is likely that pending home sales will level out at least temporarily in September , " wrote Lou Crandall , chief economist for Wrightson ICAP .
" But the outlook for the fourth quarter remains murky . "
The index for pending home sales is based on signed sales contracts for existing homes .
The transaction is reported as a sale when it closes , usually a month or two after the sales contract is signed .
Pending sales for August dropped in all four regions .
Pending sales fell by 9.5 % in the South , by 8.3 % in the Northeast , by 2.9 % in the Midwest and by 2.7 % in the West .
Through August , total sales of new and existing homes were down 14 % compared with a year earlier and 26 % from the peak in mid-2005 .
The Realtors will report on sales of existing homes for September on Oct. 24 .
Mrs Clinton ( r ) is pitching to blue - collar workers in the next primaries Hillary Clinton is scrambling to revive her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination , staking everything on contests in Ohio and Texas next month .
Her husband , former President Bill Clinton , said he thought she could win the nomination over her rival Barack Obama if she wins the two large states .
The two candidates are due to face off in a TV debate in Texas on Thursday .
Mr Obama 's latest wins came in a caucus in his home state of Hawaii and Tuesday 's primary in Wisconsin .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale says Wisconsin was a significant victory for Mr Obama , eating into Mrs Clinton 's support base .
Union endorsements Correspondents say the blue - collar vote will be crucial in the Ohio and Texas contests , and the New York senator has already begun targeting lower - income workers in her campaign ads .
" This whole nominating process has come down to Texas and Ohio , " said Bill Clinton , campaigning for his wife in Texas .
" If she wins in Texas and Ohio , she will win in Pennsylvania and I believe she will win the nomination . "
Barack Obama has gained backing from some major unions But Mr Obama has begun chipping away at her support among lower - income workers , our correspondent says , and is picking up endorsements from several major trade unions .
The Service Employees International Union endorsed him on Friday , and the Teamsters union has also given Mr Obama its backing .
" He is the candidate in the best position to lead our movement to restore the American dream for working people in this country , " Teamsters general president Jim Hoffa said .
In campaign speeches , Mrs Clinton continued to try to depict Mr Obama as a man of fine words but little action .
" It 's time that we move from good words to good works , from sound bites to sound solutions ...
This campaign goes on ! " she said , quoted by AP , at a fundraising event in New York .
" Others might be joining a movement .
I 'm joining you on the night shift , on the day shift . "

" It is going to require more than rousing speeches ...
It is going to require something more , because the problem that we face in America today is not the lack of good ideas .
It 's that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die . "
Republican frontrunner John McCain , who is now virtually assured of his party 's nomination , also appeared to attack Mr Obama .
" I will fight every moment of every day in this campaign to make sure that Americans are not deceived by an eloquent but empty call for change , " he said .
Women and youth
In the Wisconsin and Hawaii contests , Mr Obama amassed at least 55 of the delegates who will officially nominate the Democratic candidate - compared to Mrs Clinton 's 33 .
He now boasts a total of 1,335 of the delegates to his rival 's 1,251 .
Six delegates are still to be allocated .
It will take 2,025 delegates to secure the Democratic nomination at the party 's national convention this summer .
The Illinois senator was reported to have gained almost equal support from white women , and to have polled well from working - class Democrats - both groups that have usually supported Mrs Clinton .
Mr Obama also took the youth vote and six out of 10 voters who described themselves as independent , according to exit polls for ABC .
The Ohio and Texas primaries will be held on 4 March , together with the smaller New England states of Vermont and Rhode Island .

AT&T whistleblower : I was forced to connect ' big brother machine ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday November 7 , 2007

This A former technician at AT&T , who alleges that the telecom forwards virtually all of its internet traffic into a " secret room " to facilitate government spying , says the whole operation reminds him of something out of Orwell 's 1984 .
Appearing on MSNBC 's Countdown program , whistleblower Mark Klein told Keith Olbermann that a copy of all internet traffic passing over AT&T lines was copied into a locked room at the company 's San Francisco office -- to which only employees with National Security Agency clearance had access -- via a cable splitting device .
" My job was to connect circuits into the splitter device which was hard - wired to the secret room , " said Klein .
" And effectively , the splitter copied the entire data stream of those internet cables into the secret room -- and we 're talking about phone conversations , email web browsing , everything that goes across the internet . "
Asked by Olbermann how he knew what was being sent along those particular lines , Klein said it was all part of his former job : " As a technician , I had the engineering wiring documents , which told me how the splitter was wired to the secret room , " Klein continued .
" And so I know that whatever went across those cables was copied and the entire data stream was copied ... "
According to Klein , that information included internet activity about Americans .
" We 're talking about domestic traffic as well as international traffic , " Klein said . "
And that 's what got me upset to begin with . "
Previous Bush administration claims that only international communications were being intercepted are n't accurate , Klein says .
" I know the physical equipment , and I know that statement is not true , " he added .
" It involves millions of communications , a lot of it domestic communications that they 're copying wholesale , sweeping up into that secret room . "
When Olbermann asked Klein if being involved in the process reminded him of a scene in the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers , the former technician said he had another movie in mind .
" Actually , I 'm a little older so my thought was George Orwell 's 1984 and here I am forced to connect the big brother machine , " he said .
" And I felt I was in a funny position , but I needed my job , so I did n't want to make a fuss a the time .
But after I retired , I thought about it some more . "
According to ABC News , Klein believes AT&T has similar operations in place in as many as 20 other sites .
He is in Washington to lobby Congress not to pass a proposed telecom immunity bill , which would provide legal immunity to companies who secretly participated in NSA warrantless eavesdropping programs .
Some of the nation 's largest telecommunications companies are currently facing an array of class - action lawsuits related to the matter .
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on November 7 , 2007 .
In stark contrast to Obama 's speech in Iowa , declared Republican primary winner John McCain 's victory speech in New Hampshire decidedly underwhelmed the pundits on MSNBC , including Keith Olbermann , Joe Scarborough , Gene Robinson , Howard Fineman and Katrina Vanden Heuvel .

The committee probed UK involvement in rendition flights
The committee , which reports to the prime minister , was probing possible UK involvement in rendition flights .
It said America 's " lack of regard " for UK concerns had " serious implications " for future intelligence relations .
In response , the UK government said the countries ' intelligence relationship was " close " and " must continue " .
The committee said it had found no evidence that the UK was directly involved in rendition flights - the transportation of terror suspects to foreign prisons where they could face torture .
But Britain 's security services had " inadvertently " helped in one case after the US ignored caveats placed on supplied information .

It said ministerial approval should be required in future in such cases and a complete ban placed on approvals for renditions which could lead to suspects being held in secret prisons .

The committee also levelled criticism at the government over inadequate record - keeping .
Committee chairman , former Northern Ireland Secretary Paul Murphy , said : " Our inquiry has not been helped by the fact that government departments have had such difficulty in establishing the facts from their own records in relation to requests to conduct renditions through UK airspace .
" This is a matter of fundamental liberty , and we recommend that the government ensure that proper searchable records are kept in the future . "
' Strong protests '
The cross-party committee said " routine " evidence sharing in the case of two British residents in Ghana in 2002 " indirectly and inadvertently " led to their rendition .
The rendition programme has revealed aspects of this usually close relationship that are surprising and concerning
Intelligence and security committee report
Dilemmas in UK - US relationship
Bisher al - Rawi and Jamil el - Banna were flown by the CIA first to Afghanistan and then Guantanamo Bay , where el - Banna is still being held .
The committee said the UK services " used caveats specifically prohibiting any action being taken " when they handed over the intelligence on the men .
It says the UK security services did not foresee that the US authorities would disregard the caveats , given that they had honoured the caveat system for the past 20 years .
" This case shows a lack of regard on the part of the US for UK concerns - despite strong protests - and that has serious implications for the intelligence relationship , " the report concluded .
" In fighting international terrorism it is clear that the US will take whatever action it deems is necessary , within US law , to protect its national security , " it said .
" Although the US may take note of UK protests and concerns , it does not appear materially to affect their strategy ; the rendition programme has revealed aspects of this usually close relationship that are surprising and concerning , " the report warned .
' Tough talk '
The committee also criticised the UK security services for failing to react quickly enough to the change in American approach and start to use " greater caution " .
It said British intelligence had been briefed in November 2001 about new powers enabling the US authorities to arrest and detain suspected terrorists worldwide .
But officers were " sceptical about the supposed new powers because at the time there was a great deal of ' tough talk ' being used at many levels of the US administration , " the report says .
The report says British intelligence officers " should have noted the significance of these events and reported them to ministers " .
Procedures had now been tightened and provided a " reasonable level of confidence " in most cases , the committee concluded .
' Torture risk '
But it recommended two further changes to strengthen safeguards .
Rendition is the fast track to Guantanamo and we need to see the government unequivocally condemning all renditions and secret detentions
Amnesty International
" First , where despite the use of caveats and assurances there remains a real possibility that sharing intelligence with foreign liaison services might result in torture or mistreatment ... we recommend that ministerial approval should be sought in all such cases .
" Secondly , the Committee considers that ' secret detention ' , without legal or other representation , is of itself mistreatment .
" Therefore , where there is a real possibility of ' Rendition to Detention ' to a secret facility , even if it would be for a limited time , we consider that approval must never be given . "
The British government said the report supported its own " repeated assurance that there is no evidence to suggest that renditions have been conducted through the UK without our permission , or in contravention of our obligations under domestic and international law " .
The government also stressed the " importance of the UK's international intelligence relationships , particularly with the United States , in countering the threat from international terrorism " , a reality that the Committee itself acknowledges .
The government also said that British intelligence staff did inform ministers of exchanges with US counterparts in November 2001 about the US plans to arrest and detain suspected terrorist suspects worldwide .
Inquiry call
Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie attacked Gordon Brown for failing to condemn " extraordinary rendition " - a policy he said was now " being vigorously condemned by many in Washington , both Republican and Democrat " .
" This is the price the prime minister of Britain is paying for remaining so wedded to the policy he has inherited of ' hugging the Americans close ' , " added Mr Tyrie , who co-founded an all - party group on rendition and gave evidence to the committee .
Amnesty International said it welcomed the report 's acknowledgement that secret detention amounts to ' mistreatment ' and that the UK " must never give approval to measures leading to it " .
UK campaigns director Tim Hancock said : " Rendition is the fast track to Guantanamo and we need to see the government unequivocally condemning all renditions and secret detentions .
" Gordon Brown 's government should now allow a fully independent inquiry into rendition and also immediately call for all UK residents at Guantanamo to be properly tried or released and returned to the UK . "
In its role as property manager , Cushman & Wakefield worked on one of the most successful retrofits to date : the headquarters of the software maker Adobe Systems , which received a platinum LEED - EB rating for its three towers in December 2006 .
Adobe spent $ 1.4 million on the project , but earned that back in savings in less than 10 months , the company said .
It conducts tours for neighboring high - tech companies and visitors from as far as Japan and China .

“ We ’re seeing building managers , developers and property managers wanting to come in and talk to us , ” said Randy Knox , the director of real estate at Adobe .
“ That ’s where this thing is going to be turned around . ”
Indeed , it can be much easier to undertake a retrofit of a building that is owned and occupied by a single corporation or government agency .
It ’s a bigger challenge for large , multi-tenant buildings , which requires the participation of owners , leaseholders , occupants and contractors .
In addition , market activity of the last several years  when buildings were bought and sold at a frenzied pace  discouraged long - term initiatives .
For those reasons , LEED - EB is just gathering steam in the broader market .
“ We ’re seeing a lot of companies that want to be LEED - certified across their portfolios , ” Mr. Gatlin said .
The council is working with 40 or so big companies  including CB Richard Ellis , Cushman & Wakefield and corporations like Citigroup , to apply LEED standards across their buildings , he said .
David L. Pogue , a senior managing director of asset services for the Western division of CB Richard Ellis , said , “ We can make the buildings perform as well as new buildings through proper management processes . ”
The company said it would develop plans to certify more than 100 buildings in its portfolio over the coming months .
Early adapters are making a compelling case .
Consider the Merchandise Mart in Chicago .
Not only is it one of the largest buildings ever to get LEED certification ( a silver rating ) , it is also one of the world ’s largest commercial buildings .
At 4.2 million square feet , it takes up two city blocks in downtown Chicago and even has its own ZIP code .
It has nearly 6,000 tenants , many of which have design showrooms that are often remodeled , and is host to trade shows .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Abu Laith al - Libi , a wanted al Qaeda terrorist , was killed in Pakistan by a CIA airstrike , three U.S. officials told CNN Thursday .
Abu Laith al - Libi in April 2007 during a videotaped interview by al Qaeda 's media wing .
Al - Libi was described as a senior al Qaeda leader believed to have plotted and executed attacks against U.S. and coalition forces , including a February 2007 bombing at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan during a visit by Vice President Dick Cheney .
He was on a " most wanted " list of 12 accused terrorists which was issued in October by the Combined Joint Task Force - 82 -- an anti-terror unit in Afghanistan .
Earlier , a knowledgeable Western official and a military source confirmed al - Libi 's death to CNN .
The same official said al - Libi is " not far below the importance of the top two al Qaeda leaders " -- Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri .
The officials said al - Libi was killed by a missile from an airplane .
Radical Islamist
Web sites announced al - Libi 's death .
" May God have mercy on Sheikh Abu Laith al - Libi and accept him with his brothers , with the martyrs , " said a eulogy posted on a main Islamist site , Al - Ekhlaas .
Al - Libi , 41 , was of Libyan descent and was believed to have been in the Afghanistan / Pakistan border region , according to the U.S. military .
A U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN he was a significant , senior al Qaeda figure who had taken on a more prominent role in the organization in recent years .
This official also confirmed that al - Libi was responsible for plotting attacks targeting U.S. and coalition forces as well as Afghan officials .
Watch senior Arab affairs editor Octavia Nasr detail al - Libi 's significance »
In an earlier role , he was a leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , which eventually merged with al Qaeda , the counterterrorism official said , and was responsible for planning attacks throughout North Africa and the Middle East .
The official described al - Libi as part of al Qaeda 's inner circle , who helped fill the void created by the capture or death of other senior people in the organization .
A U.S. military official with Combined Joint Task Force - 82 said they have no information on al - Libi 's death .
But he added that CJTF - 82 does not collect information from outside of Afghanistan , and would be informed of targeted operations only " if the Pakistani military share (s ) that with us . "
The Pakistani military said an explosion occurred in North Waziristan on Tuesday , and 12 people were killed .
However , it was unclear whether this was the incident in which al - Libi was killed .
Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN it was not clear who attacked whom and that he could not comment on the identities of the dead since local al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates removed the bodies and buried them .
The U.S. military placed al - Libi on its most wanted list in 2006 , behind bin Laden , al - Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar .
In October , they announced rewards ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 200,000 for al - Libi and 11 other mid-level Taliban and al Qaeda leaders .
At that time , the military distributed posters and billboards with pictures and names of the insurgents around eastern Afghanistan .
Al - Libi and the others were described at the time by CJTF - 82 spokesman Maj .
Chris Belcher as " mid - level bad guys . "
He appeared in a 2002 audio recording posted on an Islamist Web site , saying al Qaeda had regrouped and intended to expand its war to include assassinations and attacks against infrastructure .
He also appeared in a 2004 video that showed him participating in an attack on an Afghan army base .
Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , the top Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , issued a statement saying al - Libi 's reported death would be " a positive development " in efforts against terrorism .
" Intelligence points to , and his [ al - Libi's ] increasing role in al Qaeda propaganda suggests , that he would have been a top field commander and planner for al Qaeda , " Hoekstra said .
" His death , if confirmed , clearly will have an impact on the radical jihadist movement . "
He said that through the committee , he would monitor the effects on al Qaeda operations .

All About Al Qaeda • Pakistan
Undetered by the failure of last week ’s joint resolution to clear the Senate , the Democrats have come up with a new plan to engage the Bush Administration on the Iraq War , you might call it the “ take - back ” strategy :
Senate Democratic leaders intend to unveil a plan next week to repeal the 2002 resolution authorizing the war in Iraq in favor of narrower authority that restricts the military ’s role and begins withdrawals of combat troops .
(…)
The new framework would set a goal for withdrawing combat brigades by March 31 , 2008 , the same timetable established by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group .
Once the combat phase ends , troops would be restricted to assisting Iraqis with training , border security and counterterrorism .
This , not a pointless and toothless resolution that condemns the war , is exactly what is needed , a real debate over the question of whether American troops actually belong in Iraq and what “ victory ” in Iraq actually means .
Hopefully , we ’ll actually get it this time .

In addition to its centrality to discussions in the philosophy of emotions , envy has sparked controversies in political philosophy .
Perhaps best known among these is the claim that egalitarian views of justice are motivated by envy .
It also receives substantial treatment from John Rawls , who takes pains to argue that envy does not pose a threat to his theory of justice .
Each of these topics receives some treatment below .
Envy is a complex and puzzling emotion .
It is , notoriously , one of the seven deadly sins in the Catholic tradition .
It is very commonly charged with being ( either typically or universally ) unreasonable , irrational , imprudent , vicious , or wrong to feel .
With very few exceptions , the ample philosophical literature defending the rationality and evaluative importance of emotions explicitly excludes envy and a few other nasty emotions as irredeemable .
Indeed , some authors who are prepared to defend even jealousy insist that envy is beyond the pale .
Yet there is considerable controversy over what precisely envy is , and the cogency of various specific criticisms of envy depends on what view of that subject is adopted .
This entry follows the widespread assumption that envy is an emotion .
[ 1 ]
That is not to say that it is a mere feeling .
Emotions are generally agreed to be more than feelings .
Most emotion theorists could agree on this vague characterization : emotions are syndromes of thoughts , feelings , motivations , and bodily movements , loosely enough bound together that a given emotional episode may not require the occurrence of every element in the syndrome .
Most theories of emotion privilege one of these elements as central , or even essential , to emotion .
Cognitive theories identify a defining thought or judgment .
Feeling theories and Motivational theories respectively take a particular affective experience or a distinctive motivational role as central or essential to a given emotion type .
The specific contours of the emotional syndrome of envy are controversial .
It is agreed that envy involves an envier ( “ Subject ” ) , a party who is envied ( “ Rival ” ) — this may be a person or group of persons — and some possession , capacity or trait that the subject supposes the rival to have ( the “ good ” ) .
The good might be something that only one party could possibly possess ( the crown jewels , or being the world ’s best go player ) , or it might be something easily duplicated .
It is sometimes held that the good may even be utility , happiness , or some psychological state that Subject could attribute to Rival even if there were no material difference in their possessions or capacities .
Most philosophers who have sought to define envy agree in treating it as a form of distress experienced by the subject because he does not possess the good and the rival does , and in attributing a desire for the good to Subject .
Many , but not all , go on to add that envy involves a desire that the rival not have the good .
This disagreement is explored below , [ see benign and invidious envy ] .
Envy is widely but not universally agreed to be a symptom or instance of the human tendency to evaluate one ’s well - being comparatively , by assessing how well one is doing in comparison with others .
Influential definitions of envy include :
Envy is pain at the good fortune of others .
( Aristotle , Rhetoric , Bk II , Chapter 10 ) Envy is a propensity to view the well - being of others with distress , even though it does not detract from one ’s own .
[ It is ] a reluctance to see our own well - being overshadowed by another ’s because the standard we use to see how well off we are is not the intrinsic worth of our own well - being but how it compares with that of others .
[ Envy ] aims , at least in terms of one ’s wishes , at destroying others ’ good fortune .
( Kant , The Metaphysics of Morals 6:459 )
Envy is that passion which views with malignant dislike the superiority of those who are really entitled to all the superiority they possess .
( Adam Smith , The Theory of Moral Sentiments , p. 244 )
Ordinary language tends to conflate envy and jealousy .
The philosophical consensus is that these are distinct emotions .
While it is linguistically acceptable to say that one is jealous upon hearing about another ’s vacation , say , it has been plausibly argued that one is feeling envy , if either , in such a case .
According to Farrell ( 1980 ) and Neu ( 1980 ) , both envy and jealousy are three - place relations ; but this superficial similarity conceals an important difference .
Jealousy involves three parties , the subject , the rival , and the beloved ; and the jealous person ’s real locus of concern is the beloved , a person ( or being ) whose affection he is losing or fears losing .
The locus of concern in jealousy is not the rival .
Whereas envy is a two party relation , with a third relatum that is a good ( albeit a good that could be a particular person ’s affections ) ; and the envious person ’s locus of concern is the rival .
On this way of distinguishing envy from jealousy there is a difference between them even when the good that the rival has is the affection of another person .
[ 2 ]
Roughly , for the jealous person the rival is fungible and the beloved is not fungible .
So he would be equally bothered if the beloved were consorting with someone else , and would not be bothered if the rival were .
Whereas in envy it is the other way around .
Because envy is centrally focused on competition with the rival , the subject might well be equally bothered if the rival were consorting with a different ( appealing ) person , but would not be bothered if the ‘ good ’ had gone to someone else ( with whom the subject was not in competition ) .
Whatever the ordinary meaning of the terms ‘ envy ’ and ‘ jealousy , ’ these considerations demonstrate that these two distinct syndromes need to be distinguished .
Many authors posit a distinction between two kinds of envy : a malicious or invidious form , and a benign , emulative , or admiring variety of envy . [ 3 ]
Typically , the point of the distinction is to identify a class of cases in which envy is somehow permissible or justifiable and separate them from cases in which it is not .
While details differ , the general idea is that invidious envy involves a desire that the rival lose the good , whereas benign envy does not .
[ 4 ]
But other philosophers claim that benign envy is not envy at all .
[ 5 ]
Like many disagreements over the nature of emotions , this one threatens to become a merely verbal dispute , but it can be understood as a substantive question about the character of an empirical phenomenon . [ 6 ]
Some of the examples advanced on behalf of the suggested bifurcation threaten to obscure the issue .
It will not do , for instance , simply to point out that people commonly say that they envy someone ’s skill in cases where it is quite implausible to suppose that they have any desire that the person loses the skill .
There is undoubtedly a common tendency to use the term ‘ envy ’ for any desire for something that is possessed by another .
But , given the looseness of natural language noted above , we must not simply assume that these are really cases of the emotional syndrome of envy .
Although some discussions of envy seem to treat any desire for [ an instance of ] what another person has as envy , this threatens to assimilate some cases of envy to admiration . [ 7 ]
Most parties to the debate would grant that not every case in which someone would like something that someone else possesses is a case of genuine envy .
First , envy is typically agreed to be a form of pain or distress — an unpleasant emotion .
To fancy someone else ’s linens is not yet to envy them .
So not every such desire should be counted as a case of benign envy .
Furthermore , even a painful desire for what someone else possesses might be better described as longing than envy .
If you badly ( painfully ) want the new Mercedes convertible , then you long for it .
If you then discover that your neighbor has bought one , does your longing become envy ?
To avoid turning this into a matter of stipulation or a verbal dispute , it should be a substantive psychological question whether you envy her for it .
Envy should not be held to follow as a logical consequence of the conjunction of your painful desire with the belief that she has ( an instance of ) its object .
But then there must be something more to envy than painfully wanting something that ( you know ) someone else has .
Robert Young suggests that what differentiates envy from mere longing is that , in ( even benign ) envy , the subject is pained because the rival has the good .
But it is questionable whether this proposal succeeds as a defense of benign envy .
If the “ because ” in question is causal - explanatory , this seems insufficient to mark the relevant distinction .
After all , ordinary longing may be occasioned by seeing the good in someone else ’s possession .
Perhaps if your neighbor had n’t acquired the convertible , it would never have come to your attention .
It would then be true that you want it because she has it , yet it seems possible that this is longing , not envy .
Suppose that you would have been equally pained by not having it regardless of how you discovered its existence .
Then the fact that , as it happens , your longing was caused by seeing it in the neighbor ’s driveway does not suffice to make this a case of envy .
But perhaps Young ’s “ because ” offers something like the agent ’s reason for being pained , or the content of a thought at which she is pained .
In other words , perhaps the point is to emphasize the idea that the subject really is bothered specifically by the difference in possession , not just by his own lack of the good .
But if so , more would need to be said to explain how how the envy can be benign .
If what pains the subject , or what he evaluates as bad , is really the disparity between the subject and the rival ( not just the subject ’s lack ) , it is hard to see how the subject could lack any desire for the rival to lose the comparative advantage .
After all , by hypothesis the situation in which the rival loses the good without the subject getting it would be better than the status quo , as far as the subject ’s envy is concerned – inasmuch as there would then be no disparity to be bothered by .
Of course the subject may not prefer all things considered that the rival lose the good .
But if he is only motivated to improve his position , and lacks any desire for the rival to lose the good , then why think that what bothers him is really the disparity , rather than just his own lack ?
Sara Protasi ( 2016 ) offers a more complex taxonomy of envy which includes a version of benign envy that she calls “ emulative envy . ”
She draws two cross-cutting distinctions : whether the subject is focused upon the good or upon the rival , and whether she perceives the good as obtainable or unobtainable .
Focus is understood not in terms of salience or conscious attention , but as a matter of evaluative concern : “ what the envier focuses on is whatever she cares about , from a prudential point of view . ” ( 2016 , p. 4 ) In emulative envy , the envier is focused on the good and believes himself capable of obtaining it .
She is motivated to improve her standing , not to bring down the rival .
But emulative envy is supposed to be distinct from admiration or even longing .
It is meant to be a species of envy in general , which Protasi defines as “ an aversive reaction to a perceived inferiority to a similar other , with regard to a good that is relevant to the sense of identity of the envier . ” ( 2016 , p.2 ) A question for this account is what role the perceived inferiority to the rival can be playing in emulative envy , if the envier is held to care only about the good , and not the inferiority as such .
If it is playing no role , then why think this is a species of envy in general , rather than a ( no doubt common and important ) emotion of some other sort ?
But if it is allowed that emulative envy does also include a concern about inferiority as such , distinct from the desire for the good , then the question is how to make that concern compatible with an insistence that there is no desire that the rival lose the good .
Even those who deny that “ benign envy ” is a kind of envy ( hereafter , “ deniers ” ) will grant the existence of cases in which people want to have skills or other traits that are possessed by another person , and are pained by their lack , but in which they have no desire at all for the other person to lose those traits .
Call such a state “ emulative desire . ”
Apparently some other languages have a word for that state . [ 8 ]
What deniers deny is that emulative desire is an instance of envy ( or of “ envy proper ” , as Rawls puts it ) .
But what is at stake in such a claim ?
We have already noted that ordinary usage surely permits application of “ envy ” in such cases , and in others besides , so linguistic propriety is not the issue .
One way of understanding the debate concerns which taxonomy of mental states carves emotions at their joints — that is , carves them in ways that reflect psychological kinds that support predictions and explanatory generalizations .
One way to develop the deniers ’ position is as follows . [ 9 ]
Envy is a distinctive kind of psychological state that is essentially competitive .
It is concerned specifically with unfavorable comparisons to others with whom the subject in some ways sees himself as in competition .
On this view , the characteristic dissatisfaction of envy supplies or embodies some level of motivation toward whatever would ameliorate the situation : in other words , toward either outdoing or undoing the rival ’s advantage
Which of those motivations will emerge in action depends on many factors .
It depends on what the situation affords , including the probabilities and expected costs and benefits of success at either option .
And it depends on other attitudes and desires of the subject , including how much he likes the rival , whether he thinks it would be wrong to deprive him of the good , and how much that wrongness matters to him .
On this view , there can still be cases of genuine envy in which the subject would not take steps to undermine the rival .
He would not even push a button to deprive the rival in secret — because he likes the rival , or because that would be a rotten thing to do to anyone .
Call such a person a “ decent envier . ”
A decent envier may sincerely believe that he has no desire whatever that the rival lose the good .
He will be wrong about this , but it can still be true that he would not act on that desire .
The attribution of genuine envy in such a case nonetheless explains some things .
It explains why even a decent envier ’s pain is prone to go away , along with some of his ambition to achieve the good , if the rival should lose it .
Why should envy go away in such cases , if all the envier wanted was to secure the good himself ?
It also explains why even decent enviers may be more likely to be amused by a story that shows the rival in a negative light , and why they become drawn to other goods that the rival acquires within the scope of the rivalry .
And it explains why some previously decent enviers become indecent enviers , or at least become aware of some ambivalence about the rival ’s possession of the good , when their efforts to secure the good for themselves prove hopeless .
In cases of emulative desire , on the other hand , presumably none of these things should be expected .
So what deniers want to say about benign envy is that either it is not really envy ( it ’s just emulative desire , or something else in the neighborhood ) or it is not really benign .
Whether the deniers ’ view should be preferred may hinge on what explanatory advantages defenders of benign envy can offer for a taxonomy that includes emulative desire as a species of envy .
Although much of the psychological literature on envy supposes that envy is concerned with matters of perceived injustice , most philosophers reject this suggestion . [ 10 ]
The received view is that envy is to be distinguished from resentment .
The latter is held to be a moral emotion , whereas the former is not .
What makes a given emotion a moral emotion has been glossed in various ways .
Roughly , the idea is that moral emotions are ones that somehow embody moral principles or appraisals .
Resentment is a moral emotion because a given emotional episode does not qualify as a state of resentment unless the subject holds some moral complaint against the object of the state .
The claim that envy is not a moral emotion should be understood as a denial that any moral complaint is part of the nature of envy as such .
It is compatible with the possibility of any number of cases in which envious people also hold moral complaints against those they envy .
And it is also compatible with the possibility of envying someone for some moral feature .
It seems clear that in many ( perhaps even most ) cases of envy , the subject is liable to find some moral complaint with which to justify negative feelings toward his rival .
This would explain various experimental findings that correlate feelings of envy with complaints of injustice .
But , of course , such complaints may be defensive rationalizations of rancorous feelings , rather than elements in envy .
Claims about which of the various thoughts that commonly attend a given type of emotion belong in a characterization of that emotion type are best defended within the context of a general theory of how to individuate emotion types , which is beyond the scope of this entry .
In any case , some version of the thesis that envy is not a moral emotion seems both plausible and necessary to make sense of the debate over whether egalitarianism is motivated by envy ( see section 3.1 below ) .
Assessments of the rationality of emotions take various forms .
It is useful to distinguish the prudential advisability of emotions ( whether they are good for the person who has them ) from their fittingness ( roughly , whether the appraisal of circumstances involved in the emotion is accurate or not ) .
Both of these assessments are to be distinguished from various ethical appraisals of emotions .
Most authors who address the issue seem to agree that envy is seldom advisable : insofar as one is able to control or influence one ’s emotions , it is best not to be envious , because envy harms those who feel it .
This is sometimes urged simply on the grounds that envy is a form of pain , but more often because , in envy , a person ’s subjective sense of well - being , self - worth or self - respect is diminished .
But if envy involves certain characteristic patterns of motivation , such as a motive to outdo or undo the rival ’s advantages , then the advisability of envy may be strongly dependent on the advisability of the actions it motivates .
And whether these actions are advisable , in turn , depends upon whether they are efficient means to the ends at which they aim , and whether those ends are themselves in the subject ’s interests .
Thus an adequate assessment of the prudential advisability of envy may well depend on whether the envious subject ’s sense that he is worse off because of his rival ’s possession of the good that he lacks is accurate .
If it is accurate , then motivation to change the situation may well be beneficial for the Subject .
We turn now to issues of accuracy .
It is commonly supposed that emotions , envy included , involve a way of taking the circumstances — a thought , construal , appraisal , or perception of the circumstances — which can then be assessed for fittingness ( objective rationality ) and / or warrant ( subjective rationality ) . [ 11 ]
Thus fear can be unfittingly directed at something that is n’t really dangerous , or fittingly directed at something that is .
And it can be unwarrantedly directed at something the subject has good reason to believe poses no danger , or warrantedly directed at what she has good reason to think dangerous — even if that good reason is supplied by misleading evidence , so that the object of the emotion is not , in fact , dangerous .
Similarly , in light of the discussion above , we might say that envy involves thinking that the rival has something good that the subject lacks , and negatively evaluating this difference in possession , per se .
Each of the various strands in this way of taking the circumstances , then , can be appraised for fittingness and warrant .
We will focus on fittingness here , but analogous points can be made in terms of warrant .
Envy will be unfitting , for instance , if the rival does not really have the good , or if the ‘ good ’ is n’t really good — for instance if the envy is directed at some possession that the subject would not really value if he knew its true nature .
These suggestions are uncontroversial .
A more interesting question concerns the last element in envy ’s characteristic appraisal : the negative evaluation of the difference in possession .
This too might be thought to be amenable of broadly rational appraisal .
Some philosophers suggest that envy is always or typically irrational , and they seem to have in mind the charge that it is unfitting . [ 12 ]
Theirs is a restricted version of the Stoic critique of emotions , according to which ( roughly ) all emotions are unfitting because they involve taking various worldly things to matter that do n’t really matter .
Not many contemporary philosophers are attracted to the Stoic view of value , which is embedded in an idiosyncratic ancient cosmology .
But perhaps specific emotions can be convicted of the putative mistake , and envy appears to be a likely suspect .
If envy involves taking the difference in possession between subject and rival to be bad in itself , then , if such differences are not bad in themselves , envy is systematically unfitting .
Developing this charge demands getting clearer about the sense in which envy can be said to involve taking the difference in possession to be bad in itself .
Suppose that envy includes some desire that the rival not have the good .
Then envy may be interpreted so as to involve a preference for the situation in which neither subject nor rival have the good to the one in which rival has it and subject does not . [ 13 ]
Call this the “ envious preference . ”
The envious preference is invoked as a basis for the claim that envy appraises the former situation as better than the latter .
But better in what respect ?
There are a number of possibilities , and we will consider just two .
First , it might be held to be better , from the point of view of the universe ( “ impersonally better ” for short ) .
Secondly , it might be held to be better for the subject .
If envy holds that the situation in which neither has the good is better , impersonally , than the one in which Rival has it , this can be criticized as an axiological mistake . [ 14 ]
Surely the world is a better place , ceteris paribus , if someone possesses a given good than if no one does .
But this is too quick .
First , consider cases in which rival has acquired the good by wrongdoing .
Arguably the world is not a better place when the fortunes of some are wrongfully improved .
Secondly , an extreme egalitarian may hold that inequalities themselves are prima facie bad , because they are unjust .
On that view , it may sometimes be better that neither possesses a given good than that one does .
Either of these considerations might then be invoked as a defense of fittingness of envy .
Thus , if envy is interpreted as making a claim about impersonal value , it will be difficult to prevent moral considerations from guiding verdicts about its fittingness . [ 15 ]
While this does not completely collapse the distinction between envy and resentment , it renders it considerably murkier .
Alternatively , envy can be held to present the difference in possession between subject and rival as bad specifically for Subject .
This interpretation of envy ’s characteristic appraisal is more plausible , and it jibes better with the doctrine that envy is not a moral feeling .
Envy can nonetheless be criticized as irrational , on this interpretation , for taking something to be bad for Subject that is not in fact bad for him .
What matters to how well things are going for Subject is a function of what goods Subject has , not what goods his rival has , the critic will suggest .
Hence , while the present state of affairs is worse for Subject than a situation in which he has the good and Rival lacks it , it is not worse than a situation in which neither has the good .
So there is no self - interested reason for Subject to have the envious preference .
Envy is therefore systematically unfitting because it takes something to be bad for the subject that is not in fact bad for him .
The cogency of this argument for the irrationality of envy depends , of course , on the plausibility of its claims about well - being .
If people do in fact systematically care about the possessions of others , and regard themselves as worse or better off accordingly as they stack up against their selected comparison class , some subjectivist accounts will license taking this concern as itself a part of these subjects ’ well - being — in which case , some envy will be fitting .
Whereas most objective accounts of well - being either treat it as a measure of primary goods , or supply content restrictions on the desires whose satisfaction contributes to well - being which would exclude desires like the envious preference .
One recent defense of the claim that envy is sometimes fitting relies on the idea that being excellent in various domains of human achievement contributes to well - being and yet is essentially a comparative matter ( D’Arms and Jacobson , 2005 ) .
If such excellences , or other positional goods , are granted to contribute in themselves to well - being , then it appears that envy will be fitting whenever a rival ’s diminution with respect to the relevant positional good improves the Subject ’s position .
A recurring suggestion in the history of philosophical and political thought has been that envy supplies the psychological foundations of the concern for justice , and , especially , of egalitarian conceptions of justice . [ 16 ]
Both the proponents of this charge and those who contest it have commonly taken it to be a damaging suggestion for egalitarianism . [ 17 ]
It is worth distinguishing genetic versions of the charge from occurrent ones .
Genetic versions concern the historical or developmental sources of a concern for equality .
Freud , for instance , held that concern with justice is the product of childhood envy of other children leading to concern for equal treatment , and thereby to ‘ group spirit ’ : “ If one can not be the favorite oneself , at all events nobody else shall be the favorite . ” ( p. 120 ) .
Nietzsche can be read as tendering an account of the origins of egalitarian values or ideals in envy in his account of the “ slave revolt in morality . ” [ 18 ]
Whatever their merits , these claims should be distinguished from the claim that those who defend egalitarian views of justice are motivated by occurrent bouts of envy or propensities to them . [ 19 ]
Defense of the charge that egalitarianism is occurrently motivated by envy hinges both on the commitments of egalitarianism and on the nature of envy .
The common motif is that egalitarians wish to do away with the advantages of the better off , and that they wish to do this because they are bothered by the very fact that the better off are better off .
This is supposed to show that egalitarians are motivated by envy .
Whether this is a fair characterization of any prominent egalitarian position is certainly open to question . [ 20 ]
But in any case , in light of the distinction between envy and resentment , it is clear that there can be no direct move from the claim that egalitarians are ‘ bothered ’ by the advantages of the better off to the claim that they are envious .
For another possibility is that what they feel is resentment , occasioned by the thought that the present distribution is unjust . [ 21 ]
Note that the claim that what is felt is resentment does not depend upon showing that the resentment is fitting — that the distribution really is unjust .
It would suffice to show that the response really is a moral evaluation , justified or not .
It seems clear that the occurrent version of the charge is only damaging to egalitarianism if the basic distinction between envy and resentment is accepted .
Otherwise , envy could be granted to motivate egalitarianism , but this would not impute any concern aside from concerns with justice to the position .
With the distinction in hand , however , the charge is difficult to defend .
Envy does not arise in cases where inequalities favor the subject .
So defenders of the charge appear to be committed to the falsifiable thesis that egalitarians are inconsistent in their commitment to inequality . [ 22 ]
If the charge were true , egalitarians should oppose only the inequalities that are unfavorable to their own interests .
To the extent that egalitarians are sincere and consistent in the embrace of their principles , this counts against the charge that their occurrent motivation is envy . [ 23 ]
A different way in which envy might be thought to motivate broadly egalitarian thought is by appeal to the idea of envy - free allocations .
A distribution of goods is said to be “ envy - free ” when no one prefers anyone else ’s bundle of resources to her own . [ 24 ]
The suggestion here is not that envy is the psychological motivation for the concern with equality , but rather that , where a distribution in fact produces envy , this is grounds to doubt the fairness of the distribution .
But ‘ envy ’ in these contexts is a technical term for any situation in which someone prefers another ’s bundles of goods , and does not refer to the emotional syndrome with which this entry is concerned . [ 25 ]
In constructing the “ original position ” from which deliberators select principles of justice in A Theory of Justice , Rawls assumes that the imagined deliberators are not motivated by various psychological propensities .
One of these is the propensity to envy .
One justification Rawls offers for this stipulation is that what principles of justice are chosen should not be affected by individual inclinations , which are mere accidents .
This rationale is less persuasive if envious concerns are universal in human nature .
Another justification is that parties in the original position should be concerned with their absolute level of primary social goods , not with their standing relative to others as such . [ 26 ]
He then proceeds in the second part of the argument for the principles of justice to consider whether , in fact , human propensities being what they are , the tendency to envy will undermine the arrangements of a well - ordered society ( in which case the principles of justice would have to be reconsidered ) .
The ‘ Problem of Envy ’ is the possibility that widespread envy might do just this .
The reason that Rawls takes this to be a live possibility is that “ the inequalities sanctioned by the difference principle may be so great as to arouse envy to a socially dangerous extent . ” [ 27 ]
The primary way in which Rawls thinks envy could pose such a threat is if it comes to undermine the self - respect of those who are less well off .
It might do this , he thinks , if the differences between the haves and the have - nots are so great that , under existing social conditions , the differences cannot help but cause loss of self - esteem .
“ For those suffering this hurt , ” he continues , “ envious feelings are not irrational ; the satisfaction of their rancor would make them better off . ”
( 534 ) He calls this “ excusable general envy , ” and offers two reasons for doubting that it will be prevalent in a well - ordered society .
First , he argues that the liberties and political status of equal citizens encourage self - respect even when one is less well off than others .
Second , he suggests that background institutions ( including a competitive economy ) make it likely that excessive inequalities will not be the rule .
Rawls ’ discussion is in some tension with the received view of envy .
He supposes that “ the main psychological root of our liability to envy is a lack of self - confidence in our own worth combined with a sense of impotence . ”
This leads him to expect that envy will be more severe the greater the differences between subjects and those they envy . [ 28 ]
However most observers of envy , from Aristotle on , have urged that it is most often felt toward those with whom the subject perceives himself as in competition , so that typically very great disparities in well - being are not envied .
And there is some empirical evidence to support this claim . [ 29 ]
This is usually explained by the hypothesis that the benchmarks against which people measure their comparative well - being are , in some ( possibly metaphorical ) sense , local .
If true , this calls into question whether preventing excessive inequalities is likely to reduce the frequency or intensity of envy .
But it also suggests that the phenomenon of general , or class , envy toward which Rawls ’ discussion is directed may not pose a substantial threat to the well - ordered society .
Harry wants a new RAMBO movie Every Year !
Published at : Jan. 23 , 2008 , 6:44 p.m. CST by headgeek
Last night AICN hosted a screening of RAMBO .
There does n't seem to be a lot of screenings of this out there - but we filled two theaters loaded with people eager to see a RAMBO movie - and man ... afterwards - we all had these goofy grins .
In our Q&A with Stallone - he stated that his opinion of what an Action film is supposed to do , is to tighten the abdominal muscle group and be a visceral ride .
I do n't think I 've ever heard a director so completely understand the purpose of an action movie .
A great action movie is supposed to make you shit your pants .
( only , without the shit )
You 're supposed to grip the armrest and / or date .
You 're supposed to squirm in your seat and say things like " Holy Shit " or my favorite - the " oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck " chant .
You know what your reaction is to a great action sequence .
Some play it cool - just smiling or clenching their teeth .
Others spill their drinks .
Whatever your reaction to great action on screen ... you 'll have that reaction , then some with RAMBO .
I 've read somewhere that the film starts off a tad on the slow side ...
Yeah - if starting off slow is setting up these Burmese bastards as the most evil fucks ever ... by them blowing people up , shooting them to pieces and just plain being evil bastards .
The film begins by educating us about the history of the Burma situation .
How long it has been going on ... and how horrible the atrocities are .
This is footage of the real thing .
It 's pretty tough .
Now RAMBO is n't a subtle film .
There 's not a lot of shades of grey here .
The missionaries that convince him to " take them up river " - well , they 're just good natured pure folk .
I 've recently become friends with some folks that do and aspire to do missionary work and frankly ...
These characters are pretty darn accurate .
They 've got that glow or purity about them ... not through cheesy lenses and lighting , but just that faith based sense of purpose .
None of these actors seem familiar in the least .
Then there 's RAMBO ...
He 's kinda fucking hilarious .
No , he 's not cracking jokes and doing stand - up .
It 's just ...
I can't think of the last time I saw a character on screen that just did n't give a shit about anybody else on screen .
He 's just his own person .
He does what he wants , when he wants to do it .
He has absolutely no respect for authority ... at all .
Remember the Quaker Oats man in HARD TARGET - well imagine if Stallone had been cast in that part - and was n't asked to be cajun ... and you 're kinda close .
It 's strange to look at RAMBO - physically - he 's nearly a completely different creation from FIRST BLOOD and the other two Rambo films as well .
Here - you have a man that just an anvil of a man .
He 's strong enough to get whatever he needs done .
His arms are tree stumps covered in veinal vines .
You just have to love him .
Every second of him .
He 's cantankerous , prickly and oh so irritable .
He just wants to live out his life on this river ... catching snakes and selling them to the snake act people .
When the missionaries show up , he just does n't really want to have anything to do with them .
They 're the sort of people that he does n't really know how to relate with .
They care .
Their hearts are filled with love for their fellow humanity .
They believe in making a difference , in the basic good in the soul of mankind .
Basically , they believe in everything that Rambo , through his life , has learned was a crock of shit .
But - of course - the pretty girl talks him into it .
So up river they go .
Of course it was a bad idea .
The movie is called RAMBO ... you know somebody is going to have a bad idea and RAMBO is going to have to deal with it .
And Rambo is n't a non-invasive surgical tool .
He 's not even blunt force trauma .
No .
When Rambo gets started - he makes the nightmare monsters of horror films seem like the cuddly things you hang on a mobile above your baby 's crib .
He 's not just death ... he 's really bad death .
He 's the closed casket version of death .
No amount of mortician 's wax is gonna fix the wreckage that he 's going to do to the bodies he comes across ... especially when the third act hits .
Now - here 's the extra cool part of this RAMBO movie .
Rambo is n't alone .
He 's got a pack of mercs .
Those guys you can hire in the back of Soldier of Fortune magazine .
Ex -SAS , Navy Seals - and just general mutherfuckers .
Guys that 'll do anything for a buck ... but also the sort that would call it quits - cuz they do n't have morality .
Rambo does though .
So basically - you know the story .
Missionaries are fucked - Rambo and the mercs go to save them ... the plan gets fucked ... and then the screen turns into a bloody fourth of July .
You remember Sam Mendes ' JARHEAD ?
Remember where they have everyone watching the Flight of the Valkyries sequence of APOCALYPSE NOW ?
Well - the last 50 minutes or so of this film are the sort of thing - that no amount of First Person Shooter game playing can give you .
It 's an adrenal orgasm .
It makes you want to fire fireworks and scream , " FUCK YEAH ! " Stallone - on the heels of ROCKY BALBOA and RAMBO has completely reclaimed his title as the badass of cinema .
There 's no other actor on film right now that can compare .
He 's Lee Marvin , John Wayne and Clint Eastwood 's ID MONSTER .
You know ...
THE WILD BUNCH ?
I love THE WILD BUNCH .
In the history of old tired fucks fucking shit up - it 's the balls .
It 's the best directed sequence of " FUCK IT " filmmaking .
Where a crazed Peckinpah sat there and said ...
I 'll give them something they ain't ever dreamt of .
And he did .
Sam , god bless him , he constructed a sequence that is just the stuff of tequila tears .
When the worm turns in RAMBO and the world is about to twist the knife and it's a bleak no - win scenario ...
That 's when RAMBO kicks in ... and man ...
Wherever Peckinpah was when he thought up that KILL EM ALL bit ... that 's where Stallone went ...
Only ... man ... you ai n't ever seen this shit before .
It 's hinted at throughout the film .
You can tell that the world is evil .
That this high calibre bang bang ... well , it is n't late 1800 's guns ... this is the mayhem and hell that only the 21st century weaponry can unleash and it's evil evil fucking human fireworks .
And it is fun .
How many bullets were fired in the MATRIX films without any REAL damage ?
Here ...
Stallone reminds you what this shit does .
He grabs you by the scruff of the neck and shakes you to say - THIS IS WHAT MODERN WARFARE AND HELL LOOKS LIKE !
And it is glorious .
When you see RAMBO this weekend - be prepared , cuz when the film knocks it up to that final gear ... jesus will weep - and you will cheer !
RAMBO would kick Jason Bourne 's pansy ass !
The Bushies have called Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez a dictator and a tyrant … but since when do dictators lose elections ?
CARACAS , Venezuela , Monday , Dec. 3 — Voters in this country narrowly defeated a proposed overhaul to the constitution in a contentious referendum over granting President Hugo Chávez sweeping new powers , the Election Commission announced early Monday . [ … ]
The outcome is a stunning development in a country where Mr. Chávez and his supporters control nearly all of the levers of power .
Almost immediately after the results were broadcast on state television , Mr. Chávez conceded defeat , describing the results as a “ photo finish . ”
“ I congratulate my adversaries for this victory , ” he said .
“ For now , we could not do it . ”
Our close ally in the “ war on terror , ” Pakistan ’s Pervez Musharraf , he ’s a dictator .
Our good friend King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , now he ’s a tyrant .
But Chávez congratulating his adversaries for winning an election ?
That ’s not a dictatorship … that ’s a functioning democracy .
Now if only Bush had accepted the will of the people as graciously as Chávez … .

Last year , the director of operations and exercises put together a drill to show how national stockpiles of medication would be distributed in Johnson County in the event of a flu pandemic or similar emergency .
A high school was used as the distribution point , and medication ( in this case , M & M candy ) was given to high school students as various officials and medical personnel assumed the roles they would play if such a disaster really occurred .

While many emergency management jobs are in the public arena , corporations like Wal - Mart Stores and Walt Disney , along with universities and hospitals , are also hiring emergency managers , who may have titles like continuity planner or business recovery planner .
In addition , a small number of businesses specialize in disaster management .
“ Disaster is a growth business , ” Mr. Blanchard said .
“ I have never heard anyone speculate that they think disaster losses will start going down in the near , mid- or far distant future . ”
He says that disaster losses have doubled or tripled in each of the last four decades , and that the complexity of disaster response is also driving growth in the field .
“ The job has become very complex , ” said Robert C. Bohlmann , director of emergency management in York County , Me. , who has been volunteering or working in the field for more than 50 years .
In the mid-1950s in Salisbury , Conn. , he volunteered at age 15 to organize the ground observer corps , which watched for low - flying planes as part of civil defense efforts during the cold war .
“ There was a lot of good training in civil defense , ” he said .
“ It was very much geared to preparing for the big one out of the sky . ”
For many years , he continued to volunteer , receiving a stipend of $ 3,000 a year in his last position before taking the York County job in 1994 .
Salaries in the field vary , typically reflecting the level of risk in a particular region and an employee ’s education and experience .
County directors of emergency management are typically paid $ 60,000 to $ 70,000 a year , with salaries in disaster - prone areas closer to $ 100,000 , Mr. Bohlmann said .

A federal judge in California has ordered the whistleblower website Wikileaks to go dark .
But the site was n’t taken out by the Feds — who have good reason to be upset with it for posting sensitive information about Gitmo and rendition flights — but rather a Swiss Bank that filed suit after the site posted documents suggesting that it was up to some financial hanky - panky in the Caymans .
The bank may have won round one , but Wikileaks and its friends are already winning round two .
The site is being mirrored in several places ( see list here ) and the bank ’s docs are readily available as a download .
I suspect that this instance of judicial overreach will be overturned and the main Wikileaks site will be back .
And in the meantime , some Swiss bankers are about to get a lesson on how hard it is to stuff digital genies back into their bottles .

CNN's CAMPBELL BROWN :
And the candidates have taken their seats .
We are ready to get started .
On behalf of CNN , Univision and the candidates , we want to thank our hosts , the University of Texas and the LBJ School and Library .
And now I want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so .
We want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to Texas and the entire nation , so we wo n't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow .
We simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point .
And we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements .
The order was determined by a draw .
Senator Obama won the draw and elected to go second .
So please go ahead , Senator Clinton .
SEN .
HILLARY CLINTON : Well , thank you .
And I am just delighted to be back here in Austin .
You know , nearly 36 years ago I came to Austin for my very first political job , and that was registering voters in south Texas .
And I had the great privilege of living for a while in Austin and in San Antonio , and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime .
And I found that we had a lot in common , a lot of shared values , a belief that hard work is important , that self - reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot .
CLINTON : And among the people whom I got to know , who became not only friends , but heroes , were Barbara Jordan , who taught me a lot about courage , and today ...
( APPLAUSE )
... would actually be her birthday .
I remember all the time about how she got up every single morning , facing almost insurmountable odds , to do what she did .
And another was my great friend Ann Richards , who taught me so much ...
( APPLAUSE )
... about determination .
Ann was a great champion for the people of Texas .
She also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is we 're engaged in .
And as I think back on those years and the work that I 've done ever since , you know , for me politics is about making real differences in people 's lives .
I am very , very proud that over these years I have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in Texas , Ohio and elsewhere .
CLINTON : You know , 350,000 children in Texas get health care every month because I helped to start the Children 's Health Insurance Program .
( APPLAUSE )
And 21,000 National Guard and Reserve members get access to health care because I went across the party line and joined up with a Republican senator to make that happen .
So there 's a lot that we 've already done .
But there 's so much more to do .
I want to take on the tough issues that face us now .
I want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they 're sick .
You know , it 's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion , but it 's OK to discriminate against sick people .
And we 're going to end that , because it 's time we said no more .
( APPLAUSE )
And I want to continue the work that I 've done in the Senate to take care of our veterans .
CLINTON : It was shocking and shameful , what happened , that we discovered about a year ago at Walter Reed .
We can do so much better , to take care of the people who 've taken care of us .
And there is a lot of work ahead .
I offer a lifetime of experience and proven results .
And I know that , if we work together , we can take on the special interests , transfer $ 55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that President Bush has given them , back to the middle class , to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable .
( APPLAUSE )
And I ask you -- I ask you to join in my campaign .
It 's now up to the people of Texas , Ohio , and the other states ahead .
So , if you 'll be part of this campaign , which is your really your campaign , about your futures , your families , your jobs and your health care , we 'll continue to make a difference for America .
Thank you all very much .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Clinton , thank you .
BROWN : Senator Obama ?
( APPLAUSE )
SEN .
BARACK OBAMA : First of all , thank you so much to the University of Texas for hosting us , and it's a great honor to share the stage once again with Senator Clinton .
I 've said before that we 've been friends before this campaign started ; we 'll be friends afterwards , unified to bring about changes in this country .
You know , we are at a defining moment in our history .
Our nation is at war , and our economy is increasingly in shambles .
And the families of Texas and all across America are feeling the brunt of that failing economy .
This week , I met a couple in San Antonio , who -- as a consequence of entering into a predatory loan -- are on the brink of foreclosure and are actually seeing them having to cut back on their medical expenses , because their mortgage doubled in two weeks .
OBAMA : I 've met a young woman who gets three hours of sleep a night because she has to work the night shift even as she 's going to school full time , and still can't afford to provide the health care for her sister who 's ill .
In Youngstown , Ohio , talked to workers who have seen their plants shipped overseas as a consequence of bad trade deals like NAFTA , literally seeing equipment unbolted from the floors of factories and shipped to China , resulting in devastating job losses and communities completely falling apart .
And all across America I 'm meeting not just veterans , but also the parents of those who have fallen .
One mother in Green Bay gave me this bracelet in memory of a 20 - year - old son who had been killed in a roadside bomb , as a consequence of a war that I believe should have never been authorized and should have never been waged and has cost us billions of dollars that could have been invested here in the United States in roads and bridges and infrastructure and making sure that young people can go to college and that those who need health care actually get it .
OBAMA : Now , Senator Clinton ...
( APPLAUSE )
... Senator Clinton and I have been talking about these issues for the last 13 months .
We both offer detailed proposals to try to deal with them .
Some of them are the same .
Some we have differences of opinion .
But I think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse .
But understand that what is lacking right now is not good ideas .
OBAMA : The problem we have is that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die .
They go to die because the lobbyists ...
( APPLAUSE )
They go to die because lobbyists and special interests have a strangle - hold on the agenda in Washington .
They go to die in Washington because too many politicians are interested in scoring political points rather than bridging differences in order to get things done .
And so the central premise of this campaign is that we can bring this country together , that we can push against the special interests that have come to dominate the agenda in Washington , that we can be straight with the American people about how we 're going to solve these problems and enlist them in taking back their government .
You know , Senator Clinton mentioned Barbara Jordan , somebody who was an inspiration to me and so many people throughout the country .
And she said that what the American people want is very simple :
They want an America that is as good as its promise .
OBAMA : I 'm running for president because I want to help America be as good as its promise .
Thank you very much .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right , Senator Obama , thank you , and let 's begin with questions .
Jorge Ramos ?
UNIVISION's JORGE RAMOS :
Thank you very much ( SPEAKING IN SPANISH ) .
Thank you so much for being with us , and let me start with a little news .
After nearly half a century in office , Fidel Castro resigned as the head of the Cuban government .
Ninety miles off the coast of the United States , we might have a new opportunity .
The question for you , Senator Clinton : Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro , or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once , to get a measure of the man ?
CLINTON : Well , Jorge , I hope we have an opportunity .
The people of Cuba deserve to have a democracy .
And this gives the Cuban government , under Raul Castro , a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother .
I 'm going to be looking for some of those changes : releasing political prisoner , ending some of the oppressive practices on the press , opening up the economy .
Of course the United States stands ready .
And , as president , I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government , once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction .
I want to bring the region together , our European allies who have influence with Cuba , to try to push for some of those changes , and to make it very clear that , if Cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people , the United States will welcome that .
CLINTON : And as president , I would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit .
But there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real ; that they are taking place ; and that the Cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves .
RAMOS : Very simply , would you meet with him or not , with Raul Castro ?
CLINTON : I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening , because I think it 's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction .
Then I think , you know , something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place .
But we 've had this conversation before , Senator Obama and myself , and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate .
But a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest , and in this case , in the interests of the Cuban people .
BROWN : Senator Obama , just to follow up , you had said in a previous CNN debate that you would meet with the leaders of Cuban , Iran , North Korea , among others , so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of Cuba .
OBAMA : That 's correct .
Now , keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in Cuba should be the liberty of the Cuban people .
And I think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the Castro regime .
And we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the United States and Cuba after over half a century .
I would meet without preconditions , although Senator Clinton is right that there has to be preparation .
It is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda , and on that agenda was human rights , releasing of political prisoners , opening up the press .
And that preparation might take some time .
But I do think that it 's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends , but also to talk to its enemies .
In fact , that 's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : One other thing that I 've said , as a show of good faith that we 're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship , what I 've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of Cuba , as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in Cuba .
And I think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful , but I would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that Senator Clinton was talking about .
BROWN : But that 's different from your position back in 2003 .
You called U.S. policy toward Cuba a miserable failure , and you supported normalizing relations .
BROWN : So you 've backtracked now ...
OBAMA : I support the eventual normalization .
And it 's absolutely true that I think our policy has been a failure .
I mean , the fact is , is that during my entire lifetime , and Senator Clinton 's entire lifetime , you essentially have seen a Cuba that has been isolated , but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of Cuba .
So I think that we have to shift policy .
I think our goal has to be ultimately normalization .
But that 's going to happen in steps .
And the first step , as I said , is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel .
And then I think it is important for us to have the direct contact , not just in Cuba , but I think this principle applies generally .
I recall what John F. Kennedy once said , that we should never negotiate out of fear , but we should never fear to negotiate .
And this moment , this opportunity when Fidel Castro has finally stepped down , I think , is one that we should try to take advantage of .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Clinton , do you want a quick response ?
CLINTON : Well , I agree , absolutely , that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone .
I 've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with Iran , for a number of years .
Because I think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us , you know , toward the world community .
It 's in our interests .
It 's in the interests of the people in countries that , frankly , are oppressed , like Cuba , like Iran .
But there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting , without preconditions , with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations .
And it should be part of a process , but I do n't think it should be offered in the beginning .
Because I think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like Raul Castro or Ahmadinejad and others .
CLINTON : And , as President Kennedy said , he would n't be afraid to negotiate , but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done , to find out exactly what we would get out of it .
And therefore , I do think we should be eliminating the policy of the Bush administration , which has been very narrowly defined , and frankly against our interests , because we have failed to reach out to countries , we have alienated our friends , and we have emboldened our enemies .
So I would get back to very vigorous diplomacy , and I would use bipartisan diplomacy .
I would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country , because I want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism , preemption and arrogance of the Bush administration is over and we 're going to ...
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Very briefly and then we 're going to move on .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : I think , as I said before , preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting .
And I think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the Bush unilateralism that 's caused so much damage .
But I do think it is important precisely because the Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago .
Because the problem is , if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned , I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time .
And I think that it 's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years , for the president to be willing to take that extra step .
OBAMA : That is the kind of step that I would like to take as president of the United States .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : A question now on the economy .
John King ?
CNN's JOHN KING : Campbell , Senators , good evening , first .
I want to bring the conversation back home .
You know from your travels -- you do n't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates .
For some , that is a question about :
What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession ?
For some , it is more focused .
Maybe it is :
Will you raise the minimum wage ?
Maybe it 's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end , as you mentioned in your opening statement , Senator Obama .
But when we ask Democrats , " How are these two candidates different ? , " they even think they do n't know .
Senator Obama , beginning with you , tell us as specifically as you can , how would a President Obama be different than a President Clinton in managing the nation 's economy ?
OBAMA : Well , first of all , let me emphasize the point that you just made , which is :
You do n't need an economist or the Federal Reserve to tell the American people that the economy 's in trouble , because they 've been experiencing it for years now .
Everywhere you go , you meet people who are working harder for less , wages and incomes have flatlined , people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump .
And so people have been struggling for a long time .
In some communities , they have been struggling for decades now .
So this has to be a priority of the next president .
Now , what I 've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy , and that means a couple of things .
Number one , with our tax code :
We 've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America .
( APPLAUSE )
We have to end the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy ...
( APPLAUSE )
... and to provide tax breaks to middle - class Americans and working Americans who need them .
OBAMA : So I 've said that if you are making $ 75,000 a year or less , I want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $ 1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary Americans .
Senior citizens making less than $ 50,000 , you should n't have to pay income tax on your Social Security .
We pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated .
( APPLAUSE )
On our trade deals , I think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade , but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of Wall Street , but also Main Street , which means we 've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards , so we do n't have toys being shipped in the United States with lead paint on them .
( APPLAUSE )
So these are all issues that I 've talked about repeatedly , and I think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy .
We send $ 1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil .
OBAMA : And for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases , generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work .
So ...
( APPLAUSE )
Now , I do n't want to take too much time .
And I 'm sure we 'll be spend more time discussing this .
Senator Clinton and I , I think , both agree on many of these issues .
And I think it 's a credit to the Democratic Party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues .
I think that there is a real , solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency .
The question people are going to have to ask is :
How do we get it done ?
And it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we 're able to form a working coalition for change .
Because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist .
The special interests and lobbyists are going to resist .
And I think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in Washington , to bring about the kinds of economic changes that I 'm talking about .
OBAMA : And that 's an area where Senator Clinton and I may have a slight difference .
But I 'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that 's been left out .
KING : Let 's give Senator Clinton that opportunity then .
( APPLAUSE )
As you have campaigned , Senator , on this issue and others , but specifically on this issue , you have said , " I am ready on day one to take charge of the economy . "
The clear implication , since you have one opponent at the moment , is that you 're ready ; he 's not .
What would you do differently on day one than a President Obama would when it comes to managing the nation 's economy ?
CLINTON : Well , I would agree with a lot that Senator Obama just said , because it is the Democratic agenda .
CLINTON : We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways .
We 're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of Texas , Ohio or anywhere else to another country .
We 're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class .
You know , the wealthy and the well - connected have had a president the last seven years , and I think it 's time that the rest of America had a president to work for you every single day .
( APPLAUSE )
We will also have a different approach toward trade .
We 're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards , but I want to have a trade time - out .
We 're going to look and see what 's working and what 's not working , and I 'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others .
We 're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint , contaminated pet food , contaminated drugs into our market .
We 're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards .
CLINTON : Now , in addition , there are steps I would take immediately .
One is on this foreclosure crisis .
I have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders .
But we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures .
Everywhere I go , I meet people who either have been or about to lose their home .
85,000 homes in foreclosure in Texas ; 90,000 in Ohio .
I 've met the families : the hairdresser , the single mom who 's going to lose her home , the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that was n't fair to him .
So I would put a moratorium for 90 days , to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes , and I would freeze interest rates for five years .
Because these adjustable - rate mortgages , if they keep going up , millions of Americans are going to be homeless .
And vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of Texas and America .
( APPLAUSE )
CLINTON : Now , in addition , there are three ways we need to jump start the economy .
Clean green jobs ; I 've been promoting this .
I wanted it to be part of the stimulus package .
I thought a $ 5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work helping to create our future .
We also need to invest in our infrastructure .
We do n't have enough roads to take care of the congestion , we have crumbling bridges and tunnels .
We need to rebuild America , and that will also put people to work .
And , finally , we need to end George Bush 's war on science , which has been waged against scientists and researchers ...
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Thank you , Senator .
And we 've got a lot of ground to cover ...
CLINTON : This is about how we fund the future .
We 've got to get back to being the innovation nation .
Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy ...
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right .
Senator Clinton , thank you very much .
BROWN : And , as I was saying , we 've got a lot to get through .
So I do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in Texas , which is immigration .
And , Jorge , you have a question .
RAMOS : ( SPEAKING IN SPANISH )
Federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the Hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million U.S. - born children who have at least one undocumented parent .
Would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed ?
CLINTON : I would consider that , except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you 're referring to .
But when we see what 's been happening , with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them , children coming home from school , no responsible adult left , that is not the America that I know .
( APPLAUSE )
CLINTON : That is against American values .
And it is ...
( APPLAUSE )
And it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government .
We need comprehensive immigration reform .
I have been for this .
I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004 .
I 've been advocating for it : tougher , more secure borders , of course , but let 's do it the right way , cracking down on employers , especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform , who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else .
I 'd like to see more federal help for communities like Austin and others like Laredo , where I was this morning , that absorb the health care , education , and law enforcement costs .
And I personally , as president , would work with our neighbors to the south , to help them create more jobs for their own people .
Finally , we need a path to legalization , to bring the immigrants out of the shadows , give them the conditions that we expect them to meet , paying a fine for coming here illegally , trying to pay back taxes , over time , and learning English .
If they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from , then they should be deported .
But for everyone else , there must be a path to legalization .
I would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Obama , is your position the same as Hillary Clinton's ?
OBAMA : There are a couple of things I would add .
Comprehensive immigration reform is something that I have worked on extensively .
Two years ago , we were able to get a bill out of the Senate .
I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through , but it died in the House this year .
Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem , nothing happened .
And so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said .
Number one , it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate , because there has been an undertone that has been ugly .
Oftentimes , it has been directed at the Hispanic community .
We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in Washington , and that is unacceptable .
We are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants , and we can reconcile those two things .
So we need comprehensive reform ...
( APPLAUSE )
... we need comprehensive reform , and that means stronger border security .
It means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they 're not paid a minimum wage .
OBAMA : They can't complain if they 're not getting overtime .
Worker safety laws are not being observed .
We have to crack down on those employers , although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that does n't lead to people with Spanish surnames being discriminated against , so there 's got to be a safeguard there .
We have to require that undocumented workers , who are provided a pathway to citizenship , not only learn English , pay back taxes and pay a significant fine , but also that they 're going to the back of the line , so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally , which raises two last points .
Number one , it is important that we fix the legal immigration system , because right now we 've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally .
( APPLAUSE )
And what 's worse is , we keep on increasing the fees , so that if you 've got a hard working immigrant family , they 've got to hire a lawyer ; they 've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees .
They just can't afford it .
And it 's discriminatory against people who have good character , we should want in this country , but do n't have the money .
So we 've got to fix that .
OBAMA : So we 've got to fix that .
The second thing is , we have to improve our relationship with Mexico and work with the Mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border .
And the problem that we have ...
( APPLAUSE )
The problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a U.S. - Mexican relationship .
And , frankly , President Bush dropped the ball .
He has been so obsessed with Iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the Mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in Mexico , but for all people .
And that 's as policy that I 'm going to change when I 'm president of the United States .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right , Senator Obama .
We 're going to stay with this topic .
I want to have John King ask another question .
Go ahead , John .
KING : I want to stay on the issue , but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in Washington , and that is the border fence .
KING : To many Americans , it is a simple question of sovereignty and security .
America should be able to keep people out that it does n't want in .
But , as you know in this state , especially if you go to the south of here , along the border , and in other border states , to many people it 's a much more personal question .
It could be a question of their livelihood .
It could be a question of cross - border trade .
It might be an issue to a rancher of property rights .
It might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members .
Senator , back in 2006 , you voted for the construction of that fence .
As you know , progress has been slow .
As president of the United States , would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction , or do you think it 's time for a president of the United States to raise his or her hand and say , " You know what ?
Wait a minute .
Let 's think about this again .
Do we really want to do this ? "
CLINTON : Well , I think both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of the immigration debate .
CLINTON : And having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact , last night I was at the University of Texas at Brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration .
Because , you know , there is a smart way to protect our borders , and there is a dumb way to protect our borders .
( APPLAUSE )
And what I learned last night when I was there with Congressman Ortiz is that the University of Texas at Brownsville would have part of its campus cut off .
This is the kind of absurdity that we 're getting from this administration .
I know it because I 've been fighting with them about the northern border .
Their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families , interfering with business and commerce , the movement of goods and people .
So what I 've said is that I would say , wait a minute , we need to review this .
There may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate .
I think when both of us voted for this , we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense , it would be considered .
But as with so much , the Bush administration has gone off the deep end , and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that I think is counterproductive .
CLINTON : So I would have a review .
I would listen to the people who live along the border , who understand ...
( APPLAUSE )
... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Let me go on , again -- John ?
KING : Does that mean that you think your vote was wrong , or the implementation of it was wrong ?
Because , as you know , when they first built the fence in the San Diego area , it only went so far .
And what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built , and they simply moved .
And California 's problem became Arizona 's problem .
( LAUGHTER )
CLINTON : But , you know , John , there is -- there 's a lot we 've learned about technology and smart fencing .
You know , there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier .
CLINTON : It requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally .
I think that the way that the Bush administration is going about this , filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities , makes no sense .
So what I have said is , yes , there are places when after a careful review , again listening to the people who live along the border , there may be limited places where it would work .
But let 's deploy more technology and personnel , instead of the physical barrier .
I frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations , business relations , recreation and so much else that makes living along the border , you know , wonderful .
BROWN : All right .
CLINTON : And the people who live there need to have a president who understands it , will listen to them and be responsive .
BROWN : All right , Senator Clinton .
( APPLAUSE )
Senator Obama , go ahead please .
OBAMA : Well , this is an area where Senator Clinton and I almost entirely agree .
I think that the key is to consult with local communities , whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier .
And the Bush administration is not real good at listening .
That 's not what they do well .
( LAUGHTER )
And so I will reverse that policy .
As Senator Clinton indicated , there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing .
But for the most part , having border patrolled , surveillance , deploying effective technology , that 's going to be the better approach .
The one thing I do have to say , though , about this issue is , it is very important for us , I think , to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here .
OBAMA : Senator Clinton and I have both campaigned in places like Iowa and Ohio and my home state of Illinois , and I think that the American people want fairness , want justice .
I think they recognize that the idea that you 're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous , that we 're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources ...
( APPLAUSE )
... to sending people back .
But what they do also want is some order to the process .
And so , we 're not going to be able to do these things in isolation .
We 're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we do n't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers .
And that 's why I think comprehensive reform is so important .
That 's the kind of leadership that I 've shown in the past ; that 's the kind of leadership that I 'll show in the future .
One last point I want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics :
Something that we can do immediately that I think is very important is to pass the Dream Act , which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as Americans , allow them the opportunity for higher education .
OBAMA : I do not want two classes of citizens in this country .
( APPLAUSE )
I want everybody to prosper .
That 's going to be a top priority .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : OK , we 've got one last question on immigration .
Jorge , go ahead .
RAMOS : ( SPEAKING SPANISH )
Right now , there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak Spanish .
( APPLAUSE )
Many of them are right here .
By the year 2050 , there will be 120 million Hispanics in the United States .
Now , is there any downside , Senator Clinton , to the United States becoming ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) becoming a bilingual nation ?
Is there a limit ?
CLINTON : Well , I think it 's important for as many Americans as possible to do what I have never been able to do , and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world .
I think it is important , though , that English remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the American experience and pursue the American dream .
You know , I have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make English the official language .
That I do not believe is appropriate , and I have voted against it and spoken against it .
CLINTON : I represent New York .
We have 170 languages in New York City alone .
And I do not think that we should be , in any way , discriminating against people who do not speak English , who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights .
But I do think that English does remain an important part of the American experience .
So I encourage people to become bilingual .
But I also want to see English remain the common , unifying language of our country .
( APPLAUSE )
RAMOS : Senator Obama , is there any down side to the United States becoming a bilingual nation ?
OBAMA : Well , I think it is important that everyone learns English and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country .
I think that 's very important .
I also think that every student should be learning a second language , because ...
( APPLAUSE )
... you know , so , when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education , for example , now , I want to make sure that children who are coming out of Spanish - speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind .
OBAMA : If bilingual education helps them do that , I want to give them the opportunity .
But I also want to make sure that English - speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of America 's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries , across borders , and that 's something frankly where we 've fallen behind .
One of the failures of No Child Left Behind , a law that I think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by , is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place .
( APPLAUSE )
And foreign languages is one of those areas that I think has been neglected .
I want to put more resources into it .
BROWN : All right .
We 're going to take a quick break .
We 've got to go to a commercial .
We 'll be back with a lot more .
There is also a debate we should mention raging online right now .
Go to our Web site , CNNpolitics.com , and join in .
The debate here at the University of Texas in Austin continues right after this .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BROWN : And we are back .
We 're here in Austin , Texas , the capital city .
Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate at the University of Texas , Austin .
The first question now goes to John King .
KING : Senator , as I 'm sitting here , we 're about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight , and I 'm having what I like to call one of those parallel universe moments .
I 've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually .
And the tone is often quite different than the very polite , substantive discourse we 've had tonight .
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
And so , I want to ask you about that .
There are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one 's credibility or truthfulness .
And , Senator Clinton , I want to talk specifically about some words you 've spoken here in the state of Texas over the past couple of days .
You 've said , quote , " My opponent gives speeches ; I offer solutions . "
You said the choice for Democrats in this campaign is , quote , " talk versus action . "
Now , in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember , maybe not many of the students here , this would be called the " Where 's the beef ? " question .
But , since we 're in Texas , I 'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you 've used yourself in the context of President Bush .
Are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle , and can you say that after the last 45 minutes ?
CLINTON : Well , I have said that about President Bush , and I think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle .
( APPLAUSE )
You know , I think you can tell from the first 45 minutes , you know , Senator Obama and I have a lot in common .
We both care passionately about our country .
We are devoted to public service .
We care deeply about the future , and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign , which has been by most standards , I think , very positive and extremely civil .
CLINTON : But there are differences between us .
And I think , in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons , we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently .
And I do offer solutions .
That 's what I believe in and what I have done .
And it's what I offer to voters because it 's part of my life , over the last 35 years , working to get kids health care , working to expand legal services for the poor , working to register voters , working to make a difference .
Because I think that this country has given me so much .
And there are differences between our records and our accomplishments .
I have to confess , I was somewhat amused , the other night , when , on one of the TV shows , one of Senator Obama 's supporters could n't .
So I know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us .
And it 's important that voters get that information .
So , yes , I do think that words are important and words matter , but actions speak louder than words .
And I offer ...
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Obama , go ahead .
BROWN : Senator Obama , do you want to respond ?
OBAMA : Well , I think actions do speak louder than words , which is why over the 20 years of my public service I have acted a lot to provide health care to people who did n't have it , to provide tax breaks to families that needed it , to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions , to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate , to make sure that we create transparency ...
( APPLAUSE )
... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education .
You know , I think if you talk to those wounded warriors at Walter Reed who , prior to me getting to the Senate , were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they 're recovering from amputations , I think they 've said that I 've engaged not just in talk , but in action .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : Now , I think that Senator Clinton has a fine record and I do n't want to denigrate that record .
I do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about .
Senator Clinton of late has said : Let 's get real .
The implication is that the people who 've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional .
( LAUGHTER )
And that , you know , the 20 million people who 've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements , including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : You know , the thinking is that somehow , they 're being duped , and eventually they 're going to see the reality of things .
Well , I think they perceive reality of what 's going on in Washington very clearly .
What they see is that if we do n't bring the country together , stop the endless bickering , actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated Washington , then we will not get anything done .
And the reason that this campaign has done so well ...
( APPLAUSE )
The reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions .
OBAMA : Senator Clinton and I share a lot of policy positions .
But if we can't inspire the American people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long , then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in Washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways .
I 'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering , and so are the people who are behind my campaign .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : I think one of the points -- I think one of the points that John King was alluding to in talking about some of Senator Clinton 's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches , that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter Deval Patrick , the governor of Massachusetts , and Senator Clinton 's campaign has made a big issue of this .
To be blunt , they 've accused you of plagiarism .
OBAMA : Right .
BROWN : How do you respond ?
OBAMA : Well , look , the -- first of all , it 's not a lot of speeches .
There are two lines in speeches that I 've been giving over the last couple of weeks .
I 've been campaigning now for the last two years .
Deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign , and suggested an argument that I share , that words are important .
Words matter .
And the implication that they do n't I think diminishes how important it is to speak to the American people directly about making America as good as its promise .
Barbara Jordan understood this as well as anybody .
OBAMA : And the notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs ...
( APPLAUSE )
... who gave me the line and suggested that I use it , I think , is silly , and ...
( APPLAUSE )
... you know , this is where we start getting into silly season , in politics , and I think people start getting discouraged about it ...
( LAUGHTER )
... and they do n't want ...
( APPLAUSE )
What they want is , how are we going to create good jobs and good wages ?
How are we going to provide health care to the American people ?
How are we going to make sure that college is affordable ?
So what I 've been talking about , in this speeches -- and I 've got to admit , some of them are pretty good .
( APPLAUSE )
What I 've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration .
It 's a $ 4,000 tuition credit for every student , every year , in exchange for national service ...
( APPLAUSE )
... so that college becomes more affordable .
OBAMA : I 've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief .
I have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the United States .
( APPLAUSE )
So just to finish up , these are very specific , concrete , detailed proposals , many of them which I have been working on for years now .
Senator Clinton has a fine record .
So do I .
I 'm happy to have a debate on the issues , but what we should n't be spending time doing is tearing each other down .
We should be spending time lifting the country up .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Clinton , is it the silly season ?
CLINTON : Well , I think that if your candidacy is going to be about words , then they should be your own words .
That 's , I think , a very simple proposition .
( APPLAUSE )
And , you know , lifting whole passages from someone else 's speeches is not change you can believe in , it 's change you can Xerox .
And I just do n't think ...
OBAMA : Come on .
( CROSSTALK )
CLINTON : No , but , you know , but , Barack , it is .
Because , you know , if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the YouTube of these videos , it does raise questions .
Now , there is no doubt that you are a passionate , eloquent speaker , and I applaud you for that .
But when you look at what we face in this country , we do need to unite the country , but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals .
CLINTON : It is not enough to say , " Let 's come together . "
We know we 're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care .
You know , when I proposed a universal health care plan , as did Senator Edwards , we took a big risk , because we know it 's politically controversial to say we 're going to cover everyone .
And you chose not to do that .
You chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people .
That 's a big difference .
When I said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures , basically your response was , well , that would n't work .
And , you know , in the last week , even President Bush has said we have to do something like that .
I just believe that we 've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face , especially after George Bush leaves the White House .
CLINTON : The world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone .
We all know that .
( APPLAUSE )
But then we 've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together , but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in , and for some of us have been fighting for , for a very long time .
You know , when I took on ...
( APPLAUSE )
When I took on universal health care back in '93 and ' 94 , it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition .
I was more than happy to do that , because I believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every American .
I do n't want to leave anybody out .
I see the results of leaving people out .
I am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in America .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right , Senator Clinton , thank you .
Senator Obama , please respond .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : Well , I think that Senator Clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we 've got some differences .
I 'm happy to debate those , which is what I think should be the focus of this campaign .
We both want universal health care .
When I released my plan a few months later , we were in a debate and Senator Clinton said we all want universal health care .
Of course , I was down 20 points in the polls at the time , and so my plan was pretty good .
It 's not as good now , but my plan has n't changed .
The politics have changed a little bit .
We both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar .
We both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of Congress .
And we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it .
OBAMA : We 're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention .
And I want to make sure that we 're applying technology to improve quality , cut bureaucracy .
Now , I also want to make sure that we 're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance .
So we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $ 2,500 per family per year .
So we 've got a lot of similarities in our plan .
We 've got a philosophical difference , which we 've debated repeatedly , and that is that Senator Clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it .
And my belief is , the reason that people do n't have it is not because they do n't want it but because they can't afford it .
And so I emphasize reducing costs .
( APPLAUSE )
And as has been noted by many observers , including Bill Clinton 's former secretary of labor , my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs , and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it .
OBAMA : Now , there are legitimate arguments for why Senator Clinton and others have called for a mandate , and I 'm happy to have that debate .
But the notion that I am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all Americans , and that is simply not true .
We think that there 's going to be a different way of getting there .
One last point I want to make on the health care front .
I admire the fact that Senator Clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993 .
She deserves credit for that .
( APPLAUSE )
But I said before , I think she did it in the wrong way , because it was n't just the fact that the insurance companies , the drug companies were battling here , and no doubt they were .
It was also that Senator Clinton and the administration went behind closed doors , excluded the participation even of Democratic members of Congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that Senator Clinton had put forward .
And , as a consequence , it was much more difficult to get Congress to cooperate .
OBAMA : And I 've said that I 'm going to do things differently .
I think we have to open up the process .
Everybody has to have a seat at the table .
And most importantly , the American people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about .
The point is this , you know , we can have great plans , but if we do n't change how the politics is working in Washington , then neither of our plans are going to happen , and we 're going to be four years from now debating once again how we 're going to bring universal health care to this country .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right , we 've got some time constraints here , so we 've got to take another real quick break .
Stay with us .
We 've got a lot more ahead .
You can compare the candidates on the issues any time ; just go to our Web site , Cnnpolitics.com .
A lot more ahead here at the University of Texas .
We 'll be right back .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : An enthusiastic crowd here at the University of Texas .
Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate .
Let 's get right to it .
Jorge Ramos with the next question .
RAMOS : Senator Clinton , yesterday you said , and I 'm quoting , " One of us is ready to be commander in chief . "
Are you saying that Senator Obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief ?
CLINTON : Well , I believe that I am ready and I am prepared .
And I will leave that to the voters to decide .
But I want to get back to health care , because I did n't get a chance to respond after Senator Obama finished .
No , let me finish , Jorge ...
RAMOS : But I would like to come back ...
CLINTON : This is a significant difference .
You know , Senator Obama has said it 's a philosophical difference .
I think it 's a substantive difference .
He has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children .
I agree with that .
I just know that if we do n't go and require everyone to have health insurance , the health insurance industry will still game the system .
Everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $ 900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance .
( APPLAUSE )
And you know , in one of our earlier debates , John Edwards made a great point .
It would be as though Social Security were voluntary .
Medicare , one of the great accomplishments of President Johnson , was voluntary .
( APPLAUSE )
I do not believe that is going to work .
So it 's not just a philosophical difference .
CLINTON : You look at what will work and what will not work .
If you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care , you will be nibbled to death , and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right .
We appreciate that you want to make a point , Senator Obama .
We have limited time , so I would like Jorge to move on to another subject or we 're going to be out of time .
( CROSSTALK )
OBAMA : Well , I understand .
But I think that Senator Clinton made a ...
( LAUGHTER )
You know , she 's making a point , and I think I should have the opportunity to respond very briefly .
And I 'll try to make ...
BROWN : Very briefly , absolutely .
OBAMA : Number one , understand that when Senator Clinton says a mandate , it 's not a mandate on government to provide health insurance , it 's a mandate on individuals to purchase it .
And Senator Clinton is right ; we have to find out what works .
OBAMA : Now , Massachusetts has a mandate right now .
They have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it .
In some cases , there are people who are paying fines and still can't afford it , so now they 're worse off than they were .
They do n't have health insurance and they 're paying a fine .
( APPLAUSE )
In order for you to force people to get health insurance , you 've got to have a very harsh penalty , and Senator Clinton has said that we wo n't go after their wages .
Now , this is a substantive difference .
But understand that both of us seek to get universal health care .
I have a substantive difference with Senator Clinton on how to get there .
BROWN : All right , Senator Clinton ?
CLINTON : Wait a minute , no , this is too important .
This is the number one issue that people talk to me about .
You know , when a mother grabs my arm and says , " I ca n't get the operation my son needs because I do n't have health insurance , " it is personal for me .
CLINTON : And I just fundamentally disagree .
You know , Senator Obama 's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not ...
OBAMA : That 's right .
CLINTON : ... insure their children .
OBAMA : That 's right .
CLINTON : Because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction , we will not get there .
OBAMA : There 's a reason .
CLINTON : He 's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick , without health insurance , well , maybe at that point you can fine them .
We would not have a social compact with Social Security and Medicare if everyone did not have to participate .
I want a universal health care plan .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : Now , that 's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child , will be able to get that health care under my plan .
Point number one .
Point number two , the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we 've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child , right now .
OBAMA : There are no excuses .
If a parent is not providing health care for that child , it 's because the parent 's not being responsible , under my plan .
And those children do n't have a choice .
But I think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it , under my plan ; they will get it , under my plan .
And it is true that , if it turns out that some are gaming the system , then we can impose , potentially , some penalties on them for gaming the system .
But the notion that , somehow , I am interested in leaving out 15 million people , without health insurance , is simply not true .
BROWN : All right .
Jorge ...
CLINTON : We disagree on that .
BROWN : OK .
Jorge -- let 's let Jorge re-ask his question , because I do n't think anyone remembers that one .
( LAUGHTER )
RAMOS : Let me try again , and not in Spanish , OK ?
( LAUGHTER )
Here we go again .
Because we also believe the war in Iraq is very important .
And here 's the question .
Are you suggesting that Senator Obama is not ready ; he does n't have the experience to be commander in chief ?
That 's a question of :
What did you mean by that phrase ?
CLINTON : What I mean is that , you know , for more than 15 years , I 've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in Kosovo , to stand up for women 's rights as human rights around the world .
I 've served on the Senate ...
( APPLAUSE )
I 've served on the Senate Armed Services Committee , and I have worked as one of the leaders in the Congress on behalf of Homeland Security in the very difficult challenges we face .
You know , just this week , it 's a good example .
We had elections in Pakistan , we had change in government in Cuba -- or at least the leadership .
We 've had the elections that , you know , should have happened that have n't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in Cuba .
We 've had Kosovo declaring independence , and we have had our embassy set on fire in Serbia .
So we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership , and also some great opportunities .
You know , we now have opportunities perhaps with Cuba , I hope with President Musharraf , for him to do the right thing .
CLINTON : I supported the independence of Kosovo because I think it is imperative that in the heart of Europe we continue to promote independence and democracy .
And I would be moving very aggressively to hold the Serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy .
Under international law , they should be doing that .
So when you think about everything that is going to happen , what we can predict and what we cannot predict , I believe that I am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief , to be the president , to turn our economy around , and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from George Bush .
And that is what I am putting forth to the voters .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Obama ?
OBAMA : I would n't be running if I did n't think I was prepared to be commander - in - chief .
( APPLAUSE )
My number one job as president will be to keep the American people safe .
I will do whatever is required to accomplish that .
I will not hesitate to act against those that would do America harm .
Now , that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth , which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly , and putting them on proper rotations .
And there are an awful lot of families here in Texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander - in - chief , and that will end when I am president .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : But it also means using our military wisely .
And on what I believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation , whether or not to go to war in Iraq , I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief .
And I think that Senator Clinton was wrong in her judgments on that .
( APPLAUSE )
Now , that has consequences -- that has significant consequences , because it has diverted attention from Afghanistan where al Qaeda , that killed 3,000 Americans , are stronger now than at any time since 2001 .
You know , I 've heard from an Army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon -- supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon .
Ended up being sent to Afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to Iraq .
OBAMA : And as a consequence , they did n't have enough ammunition , they did n't have enough humvees .
They were actually capturing Taliban weapons , because it was easier to get Taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief .
Now , that 's a consequence of bad judgment .
And you know , the question is , on the critical issues that we face right now , who 's going to show the judgment to lead ?
And I think that on every critical issue that we 've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into Iraq originally , I did n't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it .
I said this is going to distract us from Afghanistan ; this is going to fan the flames of anti-American sentiment ; it 's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military .
And I was right .
On the question of Pakistan , which Senator Clinton just raised -- we just had an election there .
But I 've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket .
That was a mistake .
We should be going after al Qaeda and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists , as well as expanding democracy .
And I was right about that .
On the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on , I have shown the judgment to lead .
That is the leadership that I want to show when I 'm president of the United States .
OBAMA : On the issues that have come up , that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on , I have shown the judgment to lead .
That is the leadership that I want to show when I 'm president of the United States .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right .
We 're going to stay with this and stay on Iraq .
John King ?
KING : I want to continue in this vein , and hone in on the very point you just made .
Because one of you , unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky , unpredictable turn , is going to be running against a decorated war hero , who is going to say that you do n't have the experience to be commander in chief .
And you have both said , it 's not about that type of experience ; it 's about judgment .
You both had to make a judgment , a short time ago , in your job in the United States Senate , about whether to support the surge .
And as that was going on , Senator Clinton , you had the commanding general in Iraq before you .
And you said , " I think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief " -- your words to General Petraeus .
KING : I want you to look at Iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better .
Ideal , no , but better -- some say significantly , in recent days , even some steps toward a political reconciliation .
Is Iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge ?
CLINTON : Well , John , I think you forget a very important premise of the surge .
The rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the Iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make .
Now , there is no doubt , given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places , and that has occurred .
CLINTON : But the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled .
The Iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way , but it has n't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began .
That is why I have said , upon taking office I would ask the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that I could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days .
And I would begin that with ...
( APPLAUSE )
... with a very clear message to the Iraqis that they no longer had a blank check , as they had been given by President Bush , that as we withdraw our troops , probably one to two brigades a month , they would have to step up and make these decisions .
CLINTON : I believe that is in the best interest of our military , which has been stretched thin .
Last night in Brownsville , you know , a woman grabbed my hand and said , " Please , my husband 's there for the third time .
Bring him home . "
And I told her privately what I have said publicly many times -- I will bring him home because I do not think it is in the interest of America or of the Iraqis that we continue to be there .
It is up to the Iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Obama , in the same vein , you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning .
Were you wrong ?
OBAMA : Well , I think it is indisputable that we 've seen violence reduced in Iraq .
And that 's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform .
In fact , you know , the 1st Cavalry , out of Fort Hood , played an enormous role in pushing back al Qaeda out of Baghdad .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : And , you know , we honor their service .
But this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder .
( LAUGHTER )
And I think that , when we 're having a debate with John McCain , it is going to be much easier for the candidate who was opposed to the concept of invading Iraq in the first place to have a debate about the wisdom of that decision ...
( APPLAUSE )
... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision .
( LAUGHTER )
Because , ultimately , that 's what 's at stake .
Understand , not only have we been diverted from Afghanistan .
We 've been diverted from focusing on Latin America .
We contribute -- our entire foreign aid to Latin America is $ 2.7 billion , approximately what we spend in Iraq in a week .
OBAMA : And it is any surprise , then , that you 've seen people like Hugo Chavez and countries like China move into the void , because we 've been neglectful of that .
Iran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded Iraq , and that is something that I think John McCain has to come to terms with .
So that is a debate that I 'm happy to have .
One last point I want to make on this , and that is , the incredible burden that has been placed on the American people , starting with military families , and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans , that we still do n't honor their service , that there are still homeless veterans , that we still do n't screen properly for post - traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they 're getting mental services that they need , that we are still ...
( APPLAUSE )
... having veterans in south Texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital .
OBAMA : That 's unacceptable .
But we talked about the economy earlier , the fact that we 're spending $ 12 billion every month in Iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive .
It means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both Senator Clinton and I are looking for .
And that is also an argument that we have to have with John McCain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years .
The notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home , more competitive here at home , allow our economy to sink .
As John McCain says , he does n't really understand the economy that well .
It is clear from his embrace of George Bush 's policies that he does n't , and that 's what I intend to change when I am president of the United States of America .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right .
We 've got to take another quick break .
We 've got a lot more ahead .
Stay with us .
We 'll be right back .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BROWN : Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate .
Stay with us after the debate .
Anderson Cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis .
But back to the debate .
John King ?
KING : Thank you .
Both of you have been harshly critical of the Bush administration for its secrecy , what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power .
Tonight , Senator Obama , you 've talked about more transparency .
You also at one point criticized earmarks .
And yet , a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects , but it still said you were responsible for $ 91 million in earmarks .
And you have refused to say where the money went , what it 's for .
Why ?
OBAMA : No , that 's not true .
We 've actually disclosed , John , all our earmarks .
And so , you know , we 'll be happy to provide you with that information , because I believe very strongly in transparency .
OBAMA : As I indicated earlier , one of the things that I did last year was to pass a bill with Tom Coburn , very conservative Republican but a sincere fiscal conservative .
And we got together and created what we call Google for Government .
It 's a searchable database , where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the Internet , so that ordinary voters can take a look .
And if they see a bridge to nowhere being built , they know where it 's going and who sponsored it .
And if they see a no - bid contract going to Halliburton , they can check that out , too .
And you know , the idea is that we open up the process so that the American people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what it 's supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money .
And I 've been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks .
OBAMA : Now , keep in mind , a lot of these are worthy projects in our states .
I have actively pursued projects that I think are important .
But I want to make sure that they 're not done in the dark of night , that they 're not done in committee , that everybody stands up and says , " this is the kind of spending that I think is important . "
I have consistently supported those efforts .
I will push for those as president of the United States of America .
KING : Senator Clinton , as you know , I think your number was about $ 342 million .
You say they 're worthy projects , as Senator Obama did , for your state and that 's part of your job , to get money for worthy projects back in your state .
Senator McCain , as you know , is proud of going around the country earmark .
On the specific issue of pork barrel spending , fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many Americans frankly think , whether it is the House or the Senate , that you all waste money on things that are n't important to them , do n't affect their daily lives , does he have a better case to make to the American people that , " I have done this my entire career ; I will do it as president , " on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending ?
CLINTON : Well , no , not at all .
Because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the Bush administration and the Iraq war , with the billions of dollars ...
( APPLAUSE )
... that have been spent , and wants it to continue .
You know , when President Bush came into office , he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus .
And it is gone .
And we now are looking at a projected deficit of $ 400 billion , under the new Bush budget , and a $ 9 trillion debt .
We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis .
That is not a winning strategy for America .
( APPLAUSE )
I will get us back to fiscal responsibility .
And I will make it clear that the Bush tax cuts on the upper income , those making more than $ 250,000 a year , will be allowed to expire .
CLINTON : Middle - class tax cuts and support for the middle class , to make college affordable , retirement security possible , health insurance affordable :
Those will be my priorities .
And I think it 's important that we look at where the money has gone under President Bush -- no-bid contracts , cronyism , outsourcing the government in ways that have n't saved us money and have reduced accountability .
So the larger question is , who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility , and I believe that we can get back on the path we were on .
It was working well .
It was one of the reasons why the economy was booming .
I 've got that , you know , clearly in my economic blueprint , which is something that I 've published the last few days , because it 's part of what we have to do again .
And I think that I will be very comfortable and effective in taking on Senator McCain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican Party that he 's been a part of .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right .
An issue relating to the current election .
Jorge ?
RAMOS : As we can see , this has been an extremely close nomination battle that will come down to superdelegates .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the highest ranking Democrat in government , said recently , and I 'm quoting , " It would be a problem " -- and this is a question for you , Senator Clinton -- " it would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided . "
Do you agree ?
CLINTON : Well , you know , these are the rules that are followed , and you know , I think that it will sort itself out .
I 'm not worried about that .
We will have a nominee , and we will have a unified Democratic Party , and we will go on to victory in November .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Obama , go ahead .
Do you have a response to Senator Clinton ?
OBAMA : Well , I think it is important , given how hard Senator Clinton and I have been working , that these primaries and caucuses count for something .
And so my belief is that ...
( APPLAUSE )
... the will of the voters , expressed in this long election process , is what ultimately will determine who our next nominee is going to be .
OBAMA : But understand what I think is most important to the voters , and that is that we have a government that is listening to them again .
They feel as if they 've been shut out .
You know , when I meet mothers who are trying to figure out how to get health care for their kids , it 's not just the desperation of that single mom .
It 's also that when they try to find some help , oftentimes they 're hitting a brick wall .
And they do n't get a sense that the debates that are happening in Washington right now relate to them at all .
And what they believe is that people are trying to get on TV and they 're trying to score points and they 're trying to win elections , and that they 're not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the American people and their dreams .
And I have no doubt that the Democratic Party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the American people .
OBAMA : And I think that the next nominee going into the November election is going to have a lot to talk about because the American people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful , by the connected .
They want their government back , and that 's what I intend to provide them when I 'm nominated for president of the United States .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : We have time for just one final question , and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question .
You 've both spent a lot of time talking about leadership , about who 's ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president .
A leader 's judgment is most tested at times of crisis .
I 'm wondering if both of you will describe what was the moment that tested you the most , that moment of crisis .
BROWN : Senator Obama ?
OBAMA : Well , you know , I would n't point to a single moment .
But what I look at is the trajectory of my life because , you know , I was raised by a single mom .
My father left when I was two , and I was raised by my mother and my grandparents .
And , you know , there were rocky periods during my youth , when I made mistakes and was off course .
And what was most important , in my life , was learning to take responsibility for my own actions , learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how I can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world .
And so , working as a community organizer on the streets of Chicago , with ordinary people , bringing them together and organizing them to provide jobs and health care , economic security to people who did n't have it , then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting the jobs on Wall Street to fight for those who were being discriminated against on the job -- that cumulative experience , I think , is the judgment that I now bring .
OBAMA : It 's the reason that I have the capacity to bring people together , and it's the reason why I am determined to make sure that the American people get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : Senator Clinton ?
CLINTON : Well , I think everybody here knows I 've lived through some crises and some challenging moments in my life .
And ...
( APPLAUSE )
And I am grateful for the support and the prayers of countless Americans .
But people often ask me , " How do you do it ? "
You know , " How do you keep going ? "
And I just have to shake my head in wonderment , because with all of the challenges that I 've had , they are nothing compared to what I see happening in the lives of Americans every single day .
along with Senator McCain , as the only two elected officials , to speak at the opening at the Intrepid Center at Brooke Medical Center in San Antonio , a center designed to take care of and provide rehabilitation for our brave young men and women who have been injured in war .
And I remember sitting up there and watching them come in .
Those who could walk were walking .
Those who had lost limbs were trying with great courage to get themselves in without the help of others .
Some were in wheelchairs and some were on gurneys .
And the speaker representing these wounded warriors had had most of his face disfigured by the results of fire from a roadside bomb .
CLINTON : You know , the hits I 've taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country .
And I resolved at a very young age that I 'd been blessed and that I was called by my faith and by my upbringing to do what I could to give others the same opportunities and blessings that I took for granted .
That 's what gets me up in the morning .
That 's what motivates me in this campaign .
( APPLAUSE )
And , you know , no matter what happens in this contest -- and I am honored , I am honored to be here with Barack Obama .
I am absolutely honored .
( APPLAUSE )
CLINTON : Whatever happens , we 're going to be fine .
You know , we have strong support from our families and our friends .
I just hope that we 'll be able to say the same thing about the American people , and that 's what this election should be about .
( APPLAUSE )
BROWN : All right , a standing ovation here in Austin , Texas .
Our thanks to Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton .
We appreciate your time tonight .
( APPLAUSE )
And to John and Jorge as well .
We also want to thank our debate partners , the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Democratic Party , the LBJ Library as well , and the city of Austin .

最近は1台のマシンにLinux とWindowsをインストールするにしてもいろいろな方法がある。それぞれのOSを別々のディスクパーティーションに置き、共通のパーティーションでファイルを共有する従来のデュアルブートシステムもあれば、Wineのように、Linuxシステム内にWindowsアプリケーションをインストールするエミュレータを利用する手もある。また、VMwareなどが提供している仮想化プログラムは双方のOSを同時に使えるという点でより理想的なソリューションに近いが、ホスト側とゲスト側の各システムが固定されていて、ゲスト側システムはウインドウ内でしか表示できない。
だが、VMware Serverを幾つかのフリーソフトウェアと組み合わせれば、Linuxシステム上のコンソールウインドウ内に制限されることなく、Windows XPをLinux環境と完全に統合された形で動かすことができる。
こうした環境を作り上げるには、3つのツールをインストールする必要がある。VMware Serverはオープンソースではないが無償提供されている。ただし、ダウンロード先と同じページからライセンス番号を取得する必要がある（当然、VMware Serverの下で動か すWindows XPも用意しなければならない）。後は、ほぼどんなLinuxディスクパーティーションにもバンドルされているRemote Desktop Protocolクライアントrdesktopと、rdesktopをWindows XPに組み込むためのユーティリティとしてCendioからGPLの下で提供されているSeamlessRDPがあればよい。
このソリューションでは、バックグラウンドで動作する仮想マシンに接続するのだが、ウインドウの枠やWindowsデスクトップは表示されない。いつものKDEまたはGNOMEのメニューバーとともに表示されるのはWindows XPのメニューバーであり、まるで双方のOSが同時に対等な形で動作しているかのような錯覚にとらわれる。図1では、画面の上下にそれぞれKDEとWindows XPの各メニューバーが表示されているのが分かる。つまり、どちらのOSからでもアプリケーションを起動できるわけだ。
まずは、通常のオプション でVMware内 にWindows XPをインストールし、ネットワーク接続のオプションをNetwork Address Translation（NAT）に設定する。これでホストマシンからの接続が単純になる。
Windows XPのインストールが完了したらログインして、Linuxから呼び出すアカウントを作成してパスワードを設定する。また、このWindows仮想マシンにはリモート接続を許可しておく必要がある。この設定は「スタート 」 →「 コントロールパネル 」 →「システム」から行う（場合によっては、クラシック表示に切り替える必要がある）。システムのアイコンをダブルクリックしてプロパティ画面を開き、「リモート」タブに切り替えて「このコンピュータにユーザーがリモートで接続することを許可する」にチェックを入れればよい。

Facebook NEW YORK ( AP ) 
Seeking to revive their lawsuit , Brooklyn residents whose homes will be lost to make way for a new arena for the NBA 's Nets urged an appeals court Tuesday to let them find out if the developer of the $ 4 billion Atlantic Yards project got a sweetheart deal .
Matthew D. Brinckerhoff , a lawyer for the families , told a three - judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that it should return the case to a federal judge in Brooklyn so they can research whether the land is being taken unfairly .
Brinckerhoff said the deal will let the Nets ' principal owner , Bruce Ratner , kick longtime property owners out of their homes so he can build what essentially is a private business on public land .
" The notion that a stadium is public use is just wrong , " he said .
" A stadium is a private , money making enterprise no different than a hotel . "
He said the appeals court should let the case proceed so he can obtain e-mails and other correspondence between public officials and Ratner to see if the deal was purposefully made to avoid looking at other options or allowing other bidders on the project .
Besides the arena , the development is to include office space and as many as 6,400 new apartments .
The project also is being challenged in state court over the validity of the state 's environmental impact review .
The appeals court did not immediately rule on the matter .
But the judges ' questions indicated the plaintiffs had a high hurdle to clear to stop the land takeover , especially since 62 % of it is considered blighted .
Preeta Bansal , a lawyer for the Empire State Development Corporation , a state agency using its eminent domain powers to condemn and seize buildings on the site , told the 2nd Circuit that the arena will be publicly owned and leased to Ratner .
" This is a valid quintessential public purpose , " she said .
Bansal said the arena could be used by schools and would result in major transportation improvements and public space , including bicycle paths .
The project would still be constitutional even if the families discovered that an e-mail from a public official said : " I want to do this for my friend Mr. Ratner , " she said .
And it would be still be legal to take the land and clear out the families even if " there might be an illicit motive lurking underneath . "
Brinckerhoff said former Gov. George Pataki had been a longtime friend of Ratner since they attended school together and Ratner had contributed to his political campaigns .
He said Ratner also had ties to Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
" The motives of public officials are not at issue in public use analysis , " Bansal said .

Edu­ca­tion as a Sys­tem
This post is part of the Money Matters For All Ages Project .
See the end of the post for a list of where it has been and where it will go !
I have a preschooler ( he ’s 3 ) and a all - too - soon - to - be preschooler ( she ’s 1 ) so I think a great deal about how I can teach them from the start to be financially intelligent and to make smart choices about money .
Even though it may seem early to start helping a three year old understand money concepts , they ’re more aware of everything already than you might think .
For us and our family , we have three main areas of understanding we ’re working to help our preschooler grasp :
The concept of what money is , as far as values of coins and bills .
My son can count , so I ’ve started explaining different coins to him , and how 5 pennies equal one nickel , four quarters equal a dollar , and other ideas like that .
I ’m working on him understanding that not all money is equal , and sometimes one of something is more valuable than 5 of something else .
I really like the way Rocket Finance has been using coins with his preschoolers as well .
Money can be exchanged for things we want .
My son is old enough now that he ’s started to want things he sees .
He sees a toy in a brochure and he wants it .
He sees an ad on TV and he wants it .
We talk about what money is and that we can use money to buy these things .
But i do n’t just give him endless amounts of money .
I do however let him make some choices with a finite amount of money , such as when we were at the zoo and he got to choose between french fries or ice cream with his $ 2 .
Lynnae at Being Frugal uses a behavior chart to help her son earn money that he can spend or save up for bigger things .
I ’m also starting the concept of a piggy bank with him , and teaching him about saving up for bigger items versus spending on small items .
Money is also a way to earn time .
My spouse goes to work at an 8 - 5 job every weekday , and my son is old enough to grasp the concept that Daddy is at work .
So we talk about work and why Daddy goes there – to make money for our family so we can do things , but also to make money so he can spend Saturdays and Sundays at home with us .
The concept that making money now can give us free time later is my first step in getting my children to understand that saving for later is a good thing .
Eventually I will add explaining about saving for college to this .
Basically , I want my children to understand at a young age that money is something we need to take care of and use wisely , and that it is n’t the best idea to spend everything as soon as we get it .
I also talk to my son about giving money away to those who need it more than us , and I will add more of that in the future ( that is a concept he just does n’t grasp quite yet ) .
What would you ( or do you ) teach preschoolers about money ?
Leave a comment with your ideas !

I AM voting today to support Michael B. Mukasey for attorney general for one critical reason : the Department of Justice — once the crown jewel among our government institutions — is a shambles and is in desperate need of a strong leader , committed to depoliticizing the agency ’s operations .
The department has been devastated under the Bush administration .
Outstanding United States attorneys have been dismissed without cause ; career civil - rights lawyers have been driven out in droves ; people appear to have been prosecuted for political reasons ; young lawyers have been rejected because they were not conservative ideologues ; and politics has been allowed to infect decision - making .
We are now on the brink of a reversal .
There is virtually universal agreement , even from those who oppose Judge Mukasey , that he would do a good job in turning the department around .
My colleagues who oppose his confirmation have gone out of their way to praise his character and qualifications .
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island , for one , commended Judge Mukasey as “ a brilliant lawyer , a distinguished jurist and by all accounts a good man . ”
Most important , Judge Mukasey has demonstrated his fidelity to the rule of law , saying that if he believed the president were violating the law he would resign .

Ruby will get under your skin .
You will miss its features and quirks when you ’re not using it .
You might even find other languages insufferable , once you get comfortable with Ruby .
After you ’ve started using Ruby , there ’s a significant chance you ’ll start loathing whatever code base you currently have to work on .
Especially if it ’s a statically compiled language .
A code base you used to think was ok , except for its few quirks .
After a while of perusing the different Ruby - related blogs , you ’ll have heard other Rubyists speak of their work with words like beauty , productivity , expressiveness , conciseness , fun and you ’ll realize just how far your current language is taking you from all of these words .
You ’ll see
Dictionary < string , string > someDic = new Dictionary < string , string >( ) ;
And dream of
some_dic = {}
You ’ll see multiple declarations for the same method , trying to emulate optional parameters and think of Ruby ’s symbols and options hashes , where such a simple method as :
def method_with_options ( options = {} )
encoding = options [ : encoding ] || ' utf - 8 '
puts ( ' Other option detected ' ) if options [ :other_option ]
#...
end
Enables all of the following uses
method_with_options : encoding => ' utf - 16 ' , :other_option => true
method_with_options : encoding => ' utf - 16 '
method_with_options :other_option => true
method_with_options
You ’ll hear about metaprogramming and the complex syntax or frameworks that can bend Java , C# or C++ to allow a programmer to achieve what he seeks .
In the back of your head , you ’ll think of the insane flexibility allowed by
– simple Ruby syntax for method chaining or redefinition ;
– dynamic class definition , that lets you add methods to any existing class , even Ruby ’s core classes ;
– duck typing , where objects of any type can be passed to a method , as long as it responds to the expected method calls in a reasonable fashion ;
and oh so many other Ruby niceties .
You ’ll encounter twisted method definitions such as
bool SomeMethod ( int param1 , ref SomeClass someClass , out SomeEnum resultType , out string result )
and think of Ruby ’s multiple returns that allows you to clearly define what ’s a return value and what ’s a parameter :
success , resultType , result = some_method ( param1 , someClass )
You ’ll delve into huge , puzzling class hierarchies that struggle just to use the right abstraction level for class names …
You ’ll eventually realize that the whole hierarchy was simply there to share a few methods among loosely similar classes .
Then you ’ll really get irritated at all the accidental complexity that could have been avoided by simply using mixins , where you define a common method and then include it in any appropriate class .
And all of this without ever puzzling over strange abstract names for classes that happen to sit between 2 clear - cut levels of abstraction .
You ’ll want to explore a new part of the .
Net API by playing with it .
You ’ll create a dummy project in some random directory , find a name for it , include the proper parts of the API in the generic main class created by default and finally start playing with the construct of interest .
All this time you ’ll be thinking of IRB , the Ruby interactive console .
It not only allows you to play with an existing API with absolutely no fuss , but thanks to Ruby ’s flexibility , you can even define classes in the console and then play with them !
But then you ’ll think “ Oh yeah , IRB is in fact so flexible that I can use if from a frickin’ web page ( with a tutorial ) ! ”
And you ’ll go play there for a couple minutes ( when no one ’s looking ) , just to keep you sane for a couple more hours .
Until the C++ / C# / Java drudgery is over for the day .
You ’ve been warned .
If you learn Ruby , you ’ll start thinking it ’s impossible for you to keep using the technology you ’re currently using at work .
If you ’re patient you ’ll try to introduce it there gently ( and most likely get frustrated at the time it takes ) .
If you ’re not so patient , you ’ll just end up changing job .
Next monday I ’m joining the great team at Karabunga to work on Defensio .
I ’ll be doing Ruby and a bit of Rails .
Liberation is coming :-)
Pope offers ' shortcut ' through purgatory Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday December 7 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This For devout Catholics fearful of a long stint in purgatory -- a vast metaphysical holding area where the faithful believe they will go to be " purified " prior to their admittance to heaven -- the Pope had some encouraging news this week : there 's an easier way .
Pope Benedict XVI has decreed that Catholics can cut short their future purgatory stays by visiting a holy shrine in Lourdes , France , a site where believers say the Virgin Mary appeared to a shephardess in 1858 .
Catholic pilgrims who visit Lourdes from now through next year , which will mark the 150th anniversary of the miracle claim , will receive an " indulgence " from the Pope , which he says will speed the trip to heaven .
" The door for indulgences is not always open , though , and for years after the Vatican Council reforms of the 1960s , they were rarely offered -- until 2000 , when Pope John Paul II started using them to attract pilgrims to World Youth Day , " reports the New York Times ' Mike Nizza .
" The pilgrimage , which must be made in the next year , can be accomplished using Vatican charter flights that began over the summer . "
For Catholics not in a position to jaunt off to France , prayer at other select sites during a ten - day span in February may also do the trick .
According to the BBC , the Pope indicated that " believers who prayed at places of worship dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes from 2 - 11 February next year -- or who were unable to make the journey -- would also be able to receive indulgences . "
" The spirit always has to be one of trust in Christ and trust in the words of Christ to his apostles , " Father Jonathan Morris , a priest , told the BBC .
" And those words were this : ' What you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven ; and what you loose on Earth will be loosed in Heaven . '
If those words are true , and if the Pope understands them correctly , indulgences really do work . "
In 1998 , Pope John Paul II announced that Catholic penitents would receive indulgences for such good deeds as quitting smoking , abstaining from alcohol , or performing a charitable act .
" Indulgences are an ancient form of church - granted amnesty from certain forms of punishment , in this life or hereafter , for sin , " the Times reported then .
" The medieval church sold indulgences , a practice that drove Martin Luther to rebel , beginning the Reformation .
They remain a source of theological debate between Protestants and Catholics ... "
The following video is from BBC's BBC World , broadcast on December 06 , 2007
Winston Churchill was not just a great politician , he was also a great orator .
Though he is now dead , his legacy lives on in the many humorous and insightful quotes he left behind .
Here is a selection of just 25 .
Quotes 1 – 5
1 . We make a living by what we get , but we make a life by what we give .
2 . There is no such thing as a good tax .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Scientists looking at a fledgling solar system have observed for the first time how water , considered a necessary ingredient for life , begins to make its way to newly forming planets .
They peered at an embryonic star called IRAS 4B located in our Milky Way galaxy about 1,000 light years from Earth in the constellation Perseus .
A light year is about 6 trillion miles , the distance light travels in a year .
NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope enabled them to find quantities of water vapor equal to five times the volume of all the oceans on Earth that had rained down onto a dusty disk around the star where planets are believed to form .
“ We ’re witnessing the arrival of some future solar system ’s supply of water , ” astronomer Dan Watson of the University of Rochester in Rochester , New York , who led the research published in the journal Nature , said in a phone interview .
“ We think that what we ’re seeing in this object now is quite a lot like what our solar system was like at the same age , ” Watson added .
Scientists eager to learn whether life exists beyond Earth believe water is one of the key ingredients needed for any life forms .
Water is abundant on Earth and other parts of our solar system , as well as elsewhere in the cosmos , for example , as ice or gas around various stars .
‘ THE STUFF OF LIFE ’
This solar system is forming inside a cocoon of gas and dust , within which is a big disk of planet - forming material .
The observations , made using equipment on the Spitzer Space Telescope called an infrared spectrograph , indicate that icy material from this outer cocoon is in a supersonic free - fall , the scientists said .
The ice vaporizes as it reaches the planet - forming disk , they said .
“ We have captured a unique phase of a young star ’s evolution , when the stuff of life is moving dynamically into an environment where planets could form , ” Michael Werner , project scientist for the Spitzer mission at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , said in a statement .
Watson said the Earth ’s supply of water was delivered through collisions with icy asteroids and comets .
He said the water vapor seen in the distant solar system will freeze again into asteroids and comets .
The star IRAS 4B is extraordinarily young , Watson said .
“ It ’s probably on the order of thousands to a couple of tens of thousands of years old , ” Watson said .
“ A star like the sun will live between 10 and 15 billion years , a total life span .
Our sun right now is 4.6 billion years old .
So this is nothing -- the time it takes for the doctor to pick up the baby , ” Watson added .
Right now , IRAS 4B is a lot less massive than the sun , but the scientists said it is too soon to say how big it ultimately will become as it continues to form .
“ How big the star turns out to be will determine , for example , how big the habitable zone is around it , ” Watson said .
The “ habitable zone ” is the region around a star in which rocky planets like Earth could exist where water would be liquid on the surface and life in theory could take hold .
Bargain hunters flocked to the Boxing Day sales yesterday on the promise of some of the biggest discounts in a decade .
From London to Aberdeen , shoppers queued in the early hours for reductions of up to 80 % as stores rushed to clear stock after a difficult December and compete with internet retailers who began slashing prices as early as Christmas Day .
An estimated 3.6 million people went online to look for bargains on Christmas Day and spent £ 52 m , according to the Interactive Media in Retail Group .
Clothes and household appliances proved most popular .
Marks & Spencer , PC World , Currys and Argos all launched early online sales as fears grew among retailers that after January , consumer confidence is likely to drop significantly .
High street retailers responded yesterday by dramatically reducing their own prices .
Expectation of large discounts saw shoppers pour into the Lakeside shopping centre in Essex where footfall , the number of customers through the doors , rose 29 % on last year .
The House of Fraser tills rang up £ 1,000 a minute in the first hour of trading .
Retailers at the Trafford Centre in Manchester reported more shoppers than last year with 10,000 cars parked by 9 am and 500 people queuing for the beginning of the Next sale .
On Oxford Street in London prices were reduced by up to 80 % and hundreds queued outside Selfridges department store before the launch of its sale at 9am .
" It was manic out there this morning , " said Jace Tyrrell , spokesman for the New West End Company .
" Bargains are available that we have n't seen in a decade .
Retailers have had a tough time this December so the sales are like a second Christmas for shoppers . "
Yesterday 's rush to the shops is expected to be surpassed today with even more shoppers turning out on what analysts expect to be the busiest shopping day of the year .
The Next sale starts at 5 am on Oxford Street , followed by John Lewis and M&S nationwide .
" We are extremely optimistic , " said Andy Street , managing director of John Lewis .
" We have fantastic special purchases and we have been helped by the hype surrounding the sales this year . "
A Timberland three - in - one cargo jacket will sell today for £ 98 - almost £ 100 less than usual .
The sales follow a difficult December for retailers .
In the week before Christmas the number of shoppers was down by 8 % on last year , according to retail analyst Experian .
It had expected fewer people than usual , partly because many fashion retailers began discounting before Christmas .
But the retailers ' aggressive discounting appears to have persuaded shoppers to come back .
Some queued from 4 am at Berryden Retail Park at Aberdeen and more than 10,000 an hour passed through the MetroCentre in Gateshead .
At least 100,000 shoppers thronged the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield .
David Bishop , 25 , an advertising manager , queued outside Selfridges in London to buy a Christmas present for his girlfriend Serina Raymond , 23 .
" She got something to open on Christmas Day , but this is the big one , " he said .
He bought her a Gucci shoulder bag for £ 213.50 , down from £ 305 .
The biggest crushes were for the sales at the concessions for Gucci , Miu Miu , Dior , Dior Homme , and Chloe , Selfridges spokesman Alistair Scott said .
The British Retail Consortium 's director general , Kevin Hawkins , said clothing , furniture and white goods should see the biggest reductions , with sales of household goods having suffered because of the slowdown in the housing market .
" It all depends on just how much stock retailers have been left with after Christmas , " he said .
" This year it looks like they might have more than they would want . "
Christmas turkeys :
The unwanted presents
An estimated £ 1.2bn was spent on unwanted gifts this Christmas and hundreds of them began appearing for sale on the internet yesterday .
The average cost of the " turkeys under the tree " , as the unwanted presents have been dubbed , is £ 20 a person , according to a survey by YouGov for eBay , the auction site .
Presents for sale yesterday included a Bart Simpson bicycle for £ 30 , a radio - controlled helicopter for £ 6.95 , a Corby tie press for £ 5 and an iPod Nano for £ 40 .
Anyone wanting a stripey jumper or pair of slippers had a wide choice .
Most mysterious was a wrapped present which " does n't rattle but smells lovely " .
It had been intended for a 22 - year - old woman whose boyfriend had left it under the tree before the couple split up following " a massive argument on Christmas Eve " .
Yesterday her mum had put it up for sale , with the encouragement that he always used to buy her nice things , so this was likely to be good too .
Any money would go to charity .
Elsewhere , a father lamented his son's lack of interest in his gift of a state - of - the - art Nokia mobile phone .
" There are too many things the phone can do for him to understand , " he said .
" These phones are all the rage , just not with my son . "
Nearly half of the 18 - to - 34 - year - olds questioned in the survey said they would consider selling unwanted gifts online , but 4 % simply planned to throw their dud presents away .
I have had a more relaxing break than last year .
With no traveling and only an occasional hour or two in my office knocking around , not working , my mind has had a chance to clear out a bit .
This is a good way to start the year .
I 've even managed not to do much professional reading these past two weeks .
About all I 've read is a stack of old MacWorld magazines .
Every time I or my department buys a Mac , I receive a complimentary 6 - month subscription .
I like to read about and try out all sorts of software , and this magazine is full of links .
But I do n't take time to read all of the issues as they roll in , which explains why I still had a couple of issues from late 2005 in my stack !
( My favorite new app from this expedition is CocoThumbX . )
New Year 's
Eve did bring in my mail the latest issue of inroads , the periodic bulletin of SIGCSE .
Rather than add it to my stack of things to read , I decided to browse through it while watching college football on TV .
I found a few items of value to my work .
In the first twenty pages or so , I encountered several short articles that set the stage for ongoing discussion in the new year of issues that have been capturing mind share among CS educators for the last year or so .
( Unfortunately , the latest issue of inroadsis not yet available in the ACM Digital Library , so I 'll have to add later the links to the articles discussed below . )
First was Bill Manaris's Dropping CS Enrollments : Or The Emperor 's New Clothes , which claims that the drop in CS enrollments may well be a result of the switch to C++ , Java , and object - oriented programming in introductory courses .
He includes a form of disclaimer late in his article by saying that his argument " is about the possibility that there is no absolute best language / paradigm for CS1 " .
This is now an almost standard disclaimer in papers about the choice of language and paradigm for introductory CS courses , perhaps as an attempt to avoid the contention of the debates that swirl around the topic .
But the heart of Manaris 's article is a claim that what most of us do in CS1 these days is not good , disclaimer notwithstanding .
That 's okay ; ideas are meant to be expressed , examined , and evaluated .
Manaris backs his position from an interesting angle : the use of usability to judge programming languages .
He quotes one of Jakob Nielsen 's papers :
On the Web , usability is a necessary condition for survival .
If a website is difficult to use , people leave .
If the homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers and what users can do on the site , people leave .
If users get lost on a website , they leave .
If a website 's information is hard to read or does n't answer users ' key questions , they leave .
Note a pattern here ?
There 's no such thing as a user reading a website manual or otherwise spending much time trying to figure out an interface .
There are plenty of other websites available ; leaving is the first line of defense when users encounter a difficulty .
Perhaps usability is a necessary condition for CS1 to retain students ?
Maybe students approach their courses and majors in the same way ?
They certainly have many choices , and if our first course raises unexpected difficulties , maybe students will exercise their choices .
Manaris moves quickly from this notion to the idea that we should consider the usability of the programming language we adopt for our intro courses .
The idea of studying how novices learn a language and using that knowledge to inform language design and choice is n't new .
The psychology of programming folks have been asking these questions for many years , and Brad Myers 's research group at CMU has published widely in this area .
But Manaris is right that not enough folks take this kind of research into account when we think about CS1 - 2 .
And when we do discuss the ideas of usability and learnability , we usually rely on our own biases and interests as " evidence " .
Relying more on usability studies of programming languages would be a good thing .
But they need to be real studies , not just more of the same old " here 's why I think my favorite language ( or paradigm ) is best ... "
Unfortunately , both of the examples Manaris gives in his article are the sort we see too often in SIGCSE circles : anecdotal reports of personal experiences , which are unavoidably biased toward one person 's knowledge and preferences .
In one , he tells of his experience coding some task in languages A and B and reports that he had " 9 compiler errors , one semantic error , and one ' headache ' error " in A. ( Hmm , could A be Java ? )
But I wonder if even some of my CS1 students would encounter these same difficulties ; the good ones can be pretty good .
In the other , a single evaluator collects data from his own experiences solving a simple task in several different programming environments .
I believe in reporting quantitative results , but quantitative data from one individual 's experience is of limited value .
How many introductory CS1 students would feel the same ?
Or intro instructors ?
We are the ones who usually make claims about languages and paradigms based almost solely on their experiences and the experiences of like - minded colleagues .
( Guess what ?
The folks I meet with at the OOPSLA educators ' symposium find OOP to be a great way to teach CS1 .
Shocking ! )
And we always need to keep in mind the difference between essential and gratuitous complexity .
I am often reminded of Alan Kay 's story about learning to play violin .
Of course it 's hard to learn .
But the payoff is huge .
To be fair , Manaris is writing an editorial , not a research paper , so his examples can be taken as hints , not exact recommendations .
When conducting usability studies of languages , we need to be sure to seek answers to several different questions .
What works best for the general population of students ?
What helps the weakest students learn as much of value as they can ?
What helps the strongest students come to see and appreciate -- even love -- the deep ideas and power of our discipline ?
Manaris closes his paper with an interesting claim :
In the minds of our beginning students , the programming language / paradigm we expose them to in CS1 is computer science .
A good CS education should help students overcome this limited mindset as soon as possible , but for students who are living through an introduction to computing , this limitation is reality .
Most importantly , for students who never go beyond CS1 -- and this includes students who might have gone on but who have an unsatisfying experience and leave -- it is a reality that defines our discipline for much of the rest of the world .
This idea leads nicely into Henry Walker 's column , What Image Do CS1 / CS2 Present to Our Students ?
a few pages later in the issue .
Walker contrasts the excitement many practitioners and instructors express about computing with the reality of most introductory courses for our students , which are often inward - looking and duller than they should be .
We define our discipline for students in the paradigm and language we teach them , but also in many other ways : in the approach to programming we model , in the kinds of assignments we give , and in the kinds of exam questions we ask .
We also define it in the ideas we expose them to .
Is computing " just programming " ?
If that 's all we show students , then for them it may well be .
What ideas do we talk about in class ?
What activities do we ask students to do ?
How much creativity do we allow them ?
CS1 can't be and do everything , but it should be something more than just a programming language and an arcane set of rules for formatting and commenting code .
Finally , this idea leads naturally into Owen Astrachan 's Head in the Clouds only two pages later .
In the last few years , Owen has become an evangelist for the position that computing education has to be grounded in real problems -- not the Towers of Hanoi , but problems that real people ( not computer scientists ) solve in the world as a part of doing their jobs and living their lives .
This is a way to get out of the inward - looking mindset that dominates many of our intro courses -- by designing them to look outward at the world of problems just waiting to be attacked in a computational way .
Owen also has been railing against the level of discourse in which CS educators partake , the sort of discourse that ask " What language should I use in CS1 ? " rather than " How can I help my students using computing as a tool to solve problems ? "
In that sense , he may not have much interest in Manaris 's article , though he may appreciate the fact the article seeks to put our focus on how the students who take our courses learn a language , rather than on the language itself .
I think that we should still start from courses designed in a meaningful context .
There is a lot of power in context , both for course design and for motivation .
Besides , working from a problem - driven focus gives us an interesting opportunity for evaluating the effects of features such as a language 's usability .
Consider Mark Guzdial 's media computation approach .
His team has developed course materials for complete CS1 courses in two languages , Python and Java ( which are , not coincidentally , two of the languages that Manaris discusses in his article ) .
These materials have been developed by the creators of the approach , with equal care and concern for the success of students using the approach .
Python is in many ways the simpler language , so it will be interesting to see whether students find one version of the course more attractive than the other .
I have taught media comp in Java , as has a colleague , and this semester he will teach it using Python .
While preparing for the semester , he has already commented on some of the ways in which Python " gets out of the way " and lets the class get down to the business of computing with images and sounds sooner .
But that is early anecdote ; what will students think and learn ?
I hope that 2008 finds the CS education community asking the right questions and moving toward answers .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Ralph Nader lashed out at the Democratic presidential candidates Monday after they said he could hurt their chances of taking back the White House .
The longtime consumer advocate announced Sunday that he will launch his fourth consecutive White House bid -- fifth if his 1992 write - in campaign is included .
In an interview with CNN on Monday , Nader accused Illinois Sen. Barack Obama of name - calling and challenged him to " address the issues . "
" Above all , explain why you do n't come down hard on the economic crimes against minorities in city ghettos : payday loans , predatory lending , rent - to - own rackets , landlord abuses , lead contamination , asbestos , " Nader said .
" There 's an unseemly silence by you , Barack -- a community organizer in poor areas in Chicago many years ago -- on this issue , " he said .
Nader called Sen. Hillary Clinton the Democrat " most loved by big business , " referencing a Fortune magazine article from last year .
Watch Nader fire back »
The June article said Clinton had " probably the broadest CEO support among the candidates " at that point .
Many Democrats fear that Nader , who turns 74 this week , could draw votes away from whoever gets the party 's nomination , potentially helping presumptive Republican nominee Sen.
John McCain win the White House in November .
Watch Nader defend his decision to run »
Obama and Clinton were quick to pounce on Nader after he made his announcement .
" He thought that there was no difference between Al Gore and George Bush , and , eight years later , I think people realize that Ralph did not know what he was talking about , " Obama said at a town hall meeting Sunday .
Clinton also said Nader " is responsible for George W. Bush " and called his candidacy " regrettable " during a Boston , Massachusetts , fundraiser Sunday night .
" We can't assume that we 're going be able to win overwhelmingly , " she said .
" We 're going to have to fight for every state , and Ralph Nader is a problem . "
Earlier , Clinton said Nader -- who says environmental policies are central to his platform -- " prevented Al Gore from being the greenest president we could have had . "
Nader has long rejected accusations that he served as a spoiler in 2000 , effectively helping Bush beat Gore .
See how many votes Nader got in 2000 »
Nader stood by his contention that Gore won the 2000 race because he took the popular vote , saying Florida 's electoral vote " was stolen from him . "
Watch former Gore adviser discuss Nader 's effect »
Nader said Democrats should " concentrate on the thieves who steal elections " instead of " scapegoating the Greens , " a reference to the Green Party , the ticket he ran on in 2000 .
" The Democrats ought to look themselves in the mirror and ask themselves why they have not been able to landslide the worst Republican Party and the White House and Congress over the last 20 years , " he said .
Nader said he does not believe that any of the candidates , including McCain , will come through on pledges to reduce the influence of special interests in Washington .
" First of all , if they wanted to do that , they 'd put front and center public funding of public campaigns , " cracking down on corporate crimes and other issues .
" Washington has closed its doors on citizen groups , " he complained , calling the nation 's capital " corporate - occupied territory . "
" We have to give the system more competition , more voices , more choices , more freedom , more diversity , " Nader said in a defense of his candidacy .

All About Ralph Nader • Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton
A plan by the nuclear industry to build a £ 1bn fuel processing plant at Sellafield is being backed by the government 's chief scientist .
The plant would turn the UK 's 60,000 tonnes of high - level nuclear waste into reactor fuel that will provide 60 per cent of this country 's electricity until 2060 , it is claimed .
' We can bury our reactor waste or we can treat it and then use it as free fuel for life , ' said the cabinet 's chief science adviser , Sir David King .
' It 's a no -brainer . '
But the plan is controversial .
A report by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority , which operates the Cumbrian plant and backs the plan , acknowledges the move could have ' downside ' economic costs , although it also stresses it has many benefits .
In addition , green groups say the move would lead to the creation of ' a plutonium economy ' in Britain that would see large quantities of nuclear fuel being transported across the country .
The Sellafield reprocessing plan would cost several billion pounds , a price that infuriates opponents of nuclear energy .
' There is no economic justification for this plan , ' said Roger Higman , of Friends of the Earth .
' It would just be another massive subsidy for the nuclear industry .
We should invest in renewables . '
But this criticism is firmly rejected by King .
He has already helped persuade the government to back a new UK reactor construction programme scheduled to be approved in the new year .
'A UK citizen is responsible for emitting 11 tonnes of carbon a year on average , ' he said .
' In France the figure is six tonnes - because France relies on nuclear power , which produces virtually no carbon dioxide .
That is why we must replace our old nuclear reactors when they reach the end of their working lives . '
But building new reactors is controversial .
Apart from their high construction costs , analysts say uranium could become scarce and expensive , with supplies from Canadian and Australian mines drying up in the next 20 years .
Reactors would then have no fuel .
But this prospect is dismissed by King .
' We have a massive reserve of high - grade plutonium and uranium in Sellafield 's nuclear waste , ' he said .
That stockpile - generated by Britain 's reactors since the Fifties - contains six tonnes of plutonium and about 60 of uranium .
However , it is mixed up with other highly radioactive reactor by - products .
To make nuclear fuel from this waste , its plutonium and uranium would have to be extracted , a task that can be achieved using Sellafield 's
Thorp reprocessing plant , though it will require a £ 1bn refurbishment to achieve this , said King .
Alternatively , a new reprocessing plant will have to be built .
Then the plutonium and uranium will have to be turned into a fuel called mox , or mixed oxide .
A plant to make mox could cost a further £ 1bn , or Sellafield 's existing mox plant could be refurbished at a similar cost .
Once these two plants - Thorp and mox - are ready , the 60,000 tonnes of nuclear waste , the leftovers of fuel production work and other highly radioactive material that has accumulated from Britain 's nuclear energy programme , could be processed .
The resulting fuel rods and pellets could then be burned in nuclear reactors over the next few decades .
In turn , the waste could be burned in a new generation of power plants called fast breeder reactors .
Under this scheme , Britain would be near self - sufficient in nuclear fuel for the rest of the century .
' Studies carried out for the NDA have looked at a range of options for this material and shown that its use in a new generation of nuclear plants has potential viability , ' said Bill Hamilton of the NDA .
' However any decision on such a programme is a matter for the government . '
This point was backed by King , who said the investment would be repaid by generating electricity .

The St. Paul Police Department is asking the city for permission to buy 230 additional Tasers .
Police spokesman Tom Walsh said the $ 210,000 purchase would allow every patrol officer in the city to have a stun gun .
" Using the Taser has allowed us to take people into custody without using deadly force , without using a degree of force that would cause a police officer to use a firearm or an additional force that would leave a person injured , " explained Walsh .
" So we find them to be effective and probably safer for both the police officer and the person who 's being arrested , " Walsh said .
Critics are concerned that the police are preparing to use the Tasers at the Republican National Convention in September .
The event , to be held in downtown St. Paul , will likely attract thousands of protesters .
But Walsh said the request has nothing to do with the convention .
He said the devices are intended to help officers in their day - to - day work .
The City Council will hold a public hearing on the matter next Wednesday .
Legend has it that two thousand years ago President Bush ’s favorite philosopher dodged the treason bullet by giving a group of Pharisees his honest opinion on the separation of church and state .
Appreciating the wisdom in keeping heavenly and earthly concerns separate , Jesus advised them to “ Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar ’s ; and to God the things that are God’s . ”
Regrettably , the 2008 presidential frontrunners of both parties are ignoring Jesus ’ advice regarding the preferred relationship between church and state by professing — ad nauseam — their undying fidelity to the Christian Right ’s version of morality and its vision of our nation as their exclusive fiefdom .
Consider the statements of two Republican candidates .
Senator John McCain said he believes the “ Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation . ”
Mike Huckabee said we should “ amend the Constitution so it ’s in God ’s standards . . .. ” McCain is pandering .
Huckabee is deadly earnest .
But keep in mind , many a democratic nation has been trampled because politicians were outsmarted by those whose boots they licked .
At least one sitting Supreme Court Justice shares Huckabee ’s “ deadly earnest ” regarding God ’s standards .
In a 2005 Supreme Court case considering whether a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments sitting near the entrance of the Texas State Capital was unconstitutional and tantamount to government endorsed religion , Justice Scalia lectured the plaintiffs , “ It is a symbol that the government derives its authority from God .
That ’s what it is about .
Our laws are derived from God . ”
It is of no little consequence when a Supreme Court justice pronounces that our laws are based on ancient biblical commands rather than on the “ godless ” Constitution .
In essence , Scalia is saying that the secular democracy envisioned by the Founding Fathers should be a Christian theocracy as envisioned by a determined sect of fundamentalists .
Not only do the folks who share Huckabee and Scalia ’s “ deadly earnest ” want to change our nation ’s Constitution , they want to change its history as well .
Rep. James Forbes ( R - VA ) , backed by thirty - one other Representatives , has proposed House Resolution 888 designating the first week in May as “ American Religious History Week . ”
The purpose of the bill is to affirm “ the rich spiritual and religious history of our Nation ’s founding and subsequent history . . . and for the appreciation of and education on America ’s history of religious faith .
If passed , this Resolution will be as divisive and detrimental to the study of American history in public schools and public squares as intelligent design creationism has been to the study of evolution .
It will — as it is meant to — bolster the Christian Right ’s claim to both our nation ’s past and its present .
Michael “ Mikey ” Weinstein , founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation and former White House counsel during the Reagan administration , said that “ House Resolution 888 is perhaps the most disgraceful , shocking and tragic example yet of the pernicious and pervasive pattern and practice of unconstitutional rape of our bedrock American citizens ’ religious freedom by the fundamentalist Christian right . ”
Mikey is not known to mince words .
That a good number of the Framers of the Constitution were Christians is undeniable .
But it is this fact that speaks strongly in defense of their decision to build the “ wall of separation ” between church and state that keeps government out of the business of religion .
Their concern was not necessarily for the rights of the nonbeliever , but for the believer ’s freedom to choose which creed he or she will embrace .
The particular genius of the Founding Fathers was their understanding that a Christian nation can be a dangerous place for both believers and nonbelievers .
They knew that government prescribed religion — usually that of the most politically connected sect — invariably leads to intolerance and tyranny .
James Madison , writing in defense of this notion , asked the question , “ Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity , in exclusion of all other religions , may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians , in exclusion of all other sects ? ”
If there is any doubt as to the salience of Madison ’s question for a secular democracy , one need only consider a promise made by Pat Robertson , the fundamentalist voice of the Christian Right and 1988 presidential candidate .
In a stump speech Robertson assured his audience that “ after the Christian majority takes over this country , pluralism ( non-fundamentalist beliefs ) will be seen as immoral and evil and the state will not permit anyone to practice it . ”
If Robertson or Huckabee or Scalia or Forbes have their way , our national motto will be modified accordingly , " E Pluribus Fides Unum " — Out of Many Beliefs , Only One .
It is a small thing for people of faith to allow religion to creep onto the public square .
What harm is there in something as seemingly innocuous as a reference to God in the national pledge or motto , a moment of prayerful silence in the classroom or in a nondenominational prayer at a high school graduation ?
Why not give equal time to creationism in public schools or support faith - based organizations with tax dollars ?
And what person of the “ true ” faith will object to their child ’s daily recitation of the Christian pledge of allegiance : “ I pledge allegiance to the Christian flag , and to the Savior for whose Kingdom it stands , One Savior , crucified , risen and coming again , with life and liberty for all who believe . ”
And for those of us who do not believe or who believe a little differently ?
In 1817 John Adams wrote to Thomas Jefferson , “ Do you recollect , or have you ever attended to the ecclesiastical strife in Maryland , Pennsylvania , New York , and every part of New England ?
What a mercy these people cannot whip and crop , and pillory and roast , as yet in the U.S. !
If they could , they would . ”
Both believer and nonbeliever have a vested interest in the secular nation envisioned by the Founding Fathers ; a nation whose “ godless ” Constitution and social pluralism ensures the kind of democracy in which the practice of any religion , or none , is an inalienable right .

[ FoRK ] Re : Arc 's out , Nu vs. newLISP , and a retort to Paul Graham 's elitism

I 'm sure you 've heard by now , but Arc is finally out :
So I took a look .
And , it turns out , Paul Graham 's a phony .
All Arc is , at present , is a little pseudo - meta - circular interpreter on top of Scheme , MzScheme to be precise .
I mean , this thing is n't much more than what a first - year CS student works through in SICP .
It 's as much a " new and different Lisp " as my own bash setup --- with a bunch of aliases and abbreviations , a homegrown module system , and a bunch of wrappers around common tools to make them behave the way I want --- is " a new and different UNIX shell . "
Some of the design choices he 's made are just bad , too .
What a let - down .

ORLANDO , Florida ( CNN ) --
Republican presidential candidates intensified their fight over which one has the true conservative credentials in a sometimes contentious debate Sunday night .
GOP hopefuls , from left , Rudy Giuliani , Mitt Romney , Fred Thompson and John McCain take the stage Sunday .
The candidates also did n't miss the opportunity to criticize Democratic front - runner Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York .
A more aggressive Fred Thompson compared former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani 's social positions with Clinton and also implied former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney once held more liberal stands than Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Massachusetts .
Asked whether Romney and Giuliani had convinced him they were consistent conservatives , the former senator from Tennessee said , " Well , we 've got an hour and a half .
Maybe they can work on it . "
Giuliani tried to turn the tables on Thompson , saying , " You know , Fred has his problems , too . "
Giuliani said , " Fred was the single biggest obstacle to tort reform in the United States Senate .
He stood with Democrats over and over again .
Fred Thompson , along with very few Republicans , blocked tort reform over and over and over again .
That is not a conservative position . "
Defending his record a day after finishing near the bottom of a conservative voter straw poll , Giuliani said , " I think it was a good conservative record .
I think , in every case , you can always find one exception or two to someone being absolutely conservative or absolutely this or absolutely that , but I think I had a heck of a lot of conservative results . "
Asked if there was little difference between himself and Clinton on social issues , he replied , " You have got to be kidding . "
Giuliani added , " She made a statement last week , and I 've been very critical of her , but I want to tell her I agree with this one . "
He then quoted her as saying : " ' I have a million ideas ; America cannot afford them all . ' "
" No kidding , Hillary .
American can't afford you . "
Sen . John McCain of Arizona blasted Romney for claiming to be the only real Republican in the field .
" Gov . Romney , you 've been spending the last year trying to fool people about your record , " McCain said .
" I do n't want you to start fooling them about mine .
I stand on my record .
I stand on my record of a conservative , and I do n't think you can fool the American people .
I think the first thing you 'd need is their respect . "
McCain , a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War , drew laughs by criticizing an earmark that Clinton backed and the Senate stripped last week .
" Sen. Clinton tried to spend $ 1 million on the Woodstock Concert Museum .
Now , my friends , I was n't there .
I 'm sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event .
I was tied up at the time , " he said .
Romney continued his criticism of Giuliani over spending and taxes , saying , " We 're not going to keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House by acting like Hillary Clinton .
Now I 'm proud of my record .
Not just of the words but of the record of the governor of Massachusetts , " he said .
" Like Mayor Giuliani I had a tough state to be running in .
I was a conservative Republican in a very Democrat state .
My legislature , 85 percent Democrat .
We face a $ 3 billion budget gap .
We solved it without raising taxes , without adding debt . "
Thompson joined the direct attack on Giuliani , criticizing his stand as mayor on immigration , abortion and gun control .
He said Giuliani " sides with Hillary Clinton on each of those issues I just mentioned . "
Asked about his concern over Romney 's record , Thompson said .
" You 've just got a minute ? "
After watching the top candidates in the Republican presidential field attack each other in the opening minutes , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee stayed above the fray .
Huckabee , left out of the early skirmishes between candidates running ahead of him in the polls , said as he was called on : " Let me begin by saying , for the first time in about nine debates , I 'm kind of glad I was n't in on the first few minutes because it was all about these guys fighting each other . "
To laughter , Huckabee said , " I am more than content to let you let them fight all they want tonight , shed each other 's blood , and then I 'll be ready to run for president because I 'm not interested in fighting these guys . "

Icann is keen to escape scrutiny by the US government
Icann made the plea in a lengthy report sent to the US Department of Commerce .
The report will be the focus of a meeting to consider Icann 's progress on objectives the US government set it in preparation for independence .
Icann argues these objectives have been achieved earlier than planned and now is the time for talk to turn into deciding what happens on independence .
Future focus
Paul Twomey , president of Icann , told the BBC news website that the process of meeting the objectives was " essentially complete " .
The US government issued a call for comments on Icann 's progress prior to the meeting .
Mr Twomey said the lengthy report was part of Icann 's response to this request detailing its achievements .
The meeting marks the half - way point for the Joint Project Agreement ( JPA ) under which Icann was tasked to comply with a series of " responsibilities " deemed necessary for its release from official oversight .
The JPA grew out of the original Memorandum of Understanding that established Icann and signalled the beginning of the end for US control .
" The Board proposes that the JPA is no longer necessary and can be concluded , " wrote Peter Dengate Thrush , chairman of the Icann board , in the letter accompanying the report .
Added Mr Twomey : " Has the process of the MoU and JPA towards building a stable , strong organisation which can do this transition , has that been successful ?
The board is effectively saying yes . "
Instead of creating more hoops for Icann to jump through , Mr Twomey said it was time for talk to move on and for thoughts about the future of the net body .
Icann keeps an eye on the net 's addressing system - the master directories of which site is where .
Work needed
Said Mr Twomey : " The JPA has been fundamentally achieved and what 's more important is for the Department of Commerce and Icann to talk about what the next stage looks like . "
But , he added , this did not mean that Icann 's work was done .
" If the question is : ' Can Icann keep improving ? ' then , yes , of course it can but that 's not the question , " he said .
" The time now is really to talk about what the final transition is going to look like . "
In the future Mr Twomey said governments would still have a role in keeping the organisation informed about public policy developments but would not be able to dictate its agenda or development .
He said one of the principles Icann had worked towards fulfilling was freedom from official influence .
Icann is due to meet the officials from the US Department of Commerce in March .
Anyone wishing to comment on its progress towards being a private body has until 14 February to let their views be known to the US government .

Right in time for the July 4th holiday week ( after all , what ’s more American than demanding your day in court ? ) , businessman Kevin Alderman and his lawyer have just filed suit against someone who goes by the name Volkov Catteneo , for copyright infringement .
This would be just one IP dispute in thousands handled by US courts every day , except for two unique features : the contention is over a virtual sex bed which does n’t exist , and the named defendant also does n’t exist .
As such , the suit will establish an enormous precedent in the new realm of virtual world law , however it shakes out .
I should back up and explain those last three sentences .
Linden Lab , the company which provides Second Life ’s virtual land ( i.e. server grid ) and means to explore it ( i.e. interface software and currency ) has since late 2003 allowed its users to retain the underlying intellectual property rights to all objects and programs created in the world with its internal building and scripting tools .
This policy unleashed enormous user - created innovation , and enabled thousands of users to make a living with their virtual content creation .
Alderman , known in Second Life as Stroker Serpentine ( pictured ) is one of SL ’s leading entrepreneurs ; his SL - based adult entertainment industry has become so successful , he recently sold his X - rated Amsterdam island in Second Life to a real world Dutch media firm for $ 50,000 very real dollars .
For the last fours years , this IP rights policy has been working more less as designed , but those who follow the virtual world business have been waiting for the other shoe to drop : what happens when one avatar tries to sue another avatar for copyright infringement in an actual court ?
It finally has : Alderman / Serpentine believes Catteno is selling unauthorized copies of his SexGen bed , a piece of furniture with special embedded animations that enable players to more or less recreate an adult film with their avatars .
Alderman sells his version for the L$ equivalent of USD $ 45 , and they ’ve helped make his fortune .
Catteno is selling his alleged knockoff for a third that price , undercutting him .
But who does Kevin Alderman sue ?
Since SL users have no obligation to reveal their real life identity to other players , all the relevant data exists only on Linden ’s servers and files .
This is why Alderman is threatening to subpoena Linden Lab for this data , so he can bring the real person behind Catteno to trial .
I contacted Stroker Serpentine in Second Life and asked why he chose going to trial .
Volkov Catteneo ’s account was created in February 2007 , while Stroker is a longtime and well - loved player .
Why not just voice his complaint about Catteno to the SL community , so they can ostracize him and his allegedly infringing beds ?
Stroker tells me he did try that method in another case , but ironically , it backfired .
“ [ T ] he last time this happened I confronted the individual about it and requested that they cease and desist … , ” he says , “ I was made out to be a bully and dragged through the [ SL community ] forums . ”
Linden Lab has a system for letting users file DMCA notices against each other ; Stroker tried that twice , but was n’t happy with how Linden responded .
So he found a law firm specializing in copyright / trademark disputes .
“ We weighed all alternatives and listened to a lot of advice .
So here we are . ”
Trouble is , Catteno tells Reuters he does n’t have any real world data on file with Linden Lab .
( A plausible claim ; since ’ 06 , it ’s no longer necessary to register a credit card or other identifying data with Linden Lab . )
I imagine the company could supply Alderman and his lawyers with Catteno ’s IP address , and let them deal with it from there .
Or if it goes forward in court , perhaps the judge will review the case , decide it ’s fundamentally nuts , and toss it .
Then again , the court might let it go to trial , as it did with another user lawsuit against Linden Lab , and what happens then is anyone ’s guess .
Numerous companies which depend on user - created content are waiting to see .
In any case , may the best avatar win .
Update , 9:00 am : For the legally minded , Reuters ’ SL reporters ( who broke this story ) have put the actual legal form in .pdf at this link .
Mike Stay and I are writing a paper for a book Bob Coecke is editing : New Structures for Physics .
The deadline is coming up soon , and we need your help !
We ’d really love comments on the ‘ logic ’ section , because neither of us are professional logicians .
I have n’t included the ‘ computation ’ section in this draft , since it ’s embarrassingly far from finished … but Mike knows computation .
You ’ll probably notice if you take a look at this draft : we ’re not trying to give a conventional treatment of proof theory … we ’re just trying to sketch how a few ideas in that subject are connected to category theory .
So , we expect that what we say will sound weird and sort of superficial to expert logicians .
But , we do n’t want to say anything too embarrassing !
In particular , we only discuss an incredibly impoverished form of the propositional calculus , without ‘ or ’ or ‘ false ’ .
This is because we ’re only trying to discuss what can be done in a symmetric monoidal closed category … the paper is long enough just doing that !
We ca n’t get into the richer categorical structures beloved by logicians .
Worse , we never mention sequents like this :
A 1 , … , A n ⊢ B A_1 , \dots , A_n \vdash B
We only mention these :
A ⊢ B A \vdash B
As Jon Cohen pointed out , this means our inference rules lack the ‘ subformula property ’ : namely that every formula about the line is a subformula of some formula below the line .
Alas , I do n’t know what to do about this problem without significantly modifying our setup .
Josh mentioned multicategories as one approach , but I have no idea how this would work for the ‘ quantum logic ’ systems our setup is designed to include .
So , I guess I ’ll just mention the problem .
In a way it does n’t really matter , since we ’re just trying to set up tenuous bridges between various subjects … just enough to get more people talking to each other .
But , it ’s good to know about the hot water we ’re getting into .
Jerome Kerviel , the reported rogue trader
The bank said the fraud was based on simple transactions , but concealed by " sophisticated and varied techniques " .
While Societe Generale has yet to name the trader , media reports say he is 31 - year - old Frenchman Jerome Kerviel .
The losses are four times greater than those made by Nick Leeson , the rogue trader who brought down Barings Bank .
Leeson was sentenced to six - and - a- half years in jail .
' A daily occurrence '
Speaking to the BBC , Leeson said he was not shocked that the latest fraud had taken place - only its scale .
" Rogue trading is probably a daily occurrence within the financial markets , " he said .
" What shocked me was the size .
I never for one moment believed it would get to this degree of magnitude , this degree of loss . "
Societe Generale 's shares , which were suspended in the morning , ended the day down 4.1 % .
' Alone '
According to reports , Mr Kerviel worked at the bank 's Delta One products team in Paris .
The sheer scale of the loss is overpowering

How traders turn rogue
Although Societe Generale has yet to confirm his name , it did say that the trader was a Frenchman in his 30s who joined the bank in 2000 and earned a salary and bonus of less than 100,000 euros .
He was responsible for betting on the markets ' future performance , bank executives said .
" I 'm convinced he acted alone , " said Jean - Pierre Mustier , chief executive of the corporate and investment banking division , who interviewed the trader after the fraud was uncovered .
Societe Generale said the trader had taken what it called " massive fraudulent directional positions in 2007 and 2008 beyond his limited authority " .
Executives said the trader may not have sought personal gain from the fraudulent deals .
The fraud is an extraordinary echo of the rogue trader , Nick Leeson , who caused the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995 , says BBC business correspondent Nils Blythe .
But the losses uncovered by Barings bosses totalled just £ 860 m - about a quarter of the amount lost by Societe Generale .
' Secret trade '
The bank , one of France 's largest , will need to seek 5.5 bn euros in new capital to offset the losses .
SOCIETE GENERALE IN FIGURES
Founded in 1864 467bn euros in assets under management ( as of June 2007 ) 22.5 m customers worldwide 120,000 employees in 77 countries
Societe Generale share price
But it said it would still make a profit of 600 m to 800 m euros for 2007 , despite the blow to its balance sheet .
The bank said the trader responsible for the fraud had " in - depth knowledge of the control procedures resulting from this former employment in the middle - office " .
" The transactions which involved the fraud were simple - taking a position on shares rising - but hidden using extremely sophisticated and varied techniques , " chief executive Daniel Bouton said in a letter to the bank 's customers .
The bank said that the trader had confessed to the fraud and was being dismissed .
His managers were to leave the bank as well .
" I am sorry but I have a hard time buying the fact that a trader was able to set up a ' secret trade ' of 4.9 billion without anybody finding out , " said Ion -Marc Valhi at Amas Bank .
Frederic Hamm , fund manager at Agilis Gestion , believes that the fraud " impacts the reputation of the bank " .
Mr Bouton offered his resignation but it was rejected by the board , the bank said .
Richard Fuld , the chairman of Lehman Brothers , told BBC News in Davos that " nothing stuns me , nothing really surprises me these days . "
' Unprecedented event '
The bank 's losses have seriously dented its profits for 2007 .
SOME MAJOR BANK FRAUDS 2008 : Societe Generale , alleged fraud by a trader , 4.9bn euros loss 2002 : former currency trader accused of hiding $ 691 m in losses at Allfirst bank of Baltimore 1995 : UK's Barings Bank collapsed after a trader Nick Leeson lost £ 860 m ( $ 1.28 bn at the time ) on futures trades
The company will announce its full year results on February 21 , and it said that it expects its 2007 net income to be in the range of 600 m - 800 m euros .
Shares in Societe Generale have fallen by nearly 50 % in the past six months .
Societe Generale is also going to raise 5.5 bn euros through a capital increase " to strengthen its capital base " .
Meanwhile , another French bank , BNP Paribas , said that " it has not revealed any loss of item that would justify any particular warning to the market " .
Gilles Glicenstein , BNP Paribas Investment Partners chief executive , suggested that " there is still some information missing to understand what happened " at Societe Generale .
" Because the scale of the fraud is so large , there must be a complex explanation ...
For Societe Generale , it 's an unprecedented event , " he added .
Mr Glicenstein also said it was not good news for banks in general , as " it can create doubt " .
" In other periods , this type of news was hidden , but today , there is a tendency to reveal everything and maybe it's by revealing everything that confidence can return , " he said .
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said that Societe Generale " has taken serious measures to cope with the situation " .
" I note too that the Bank of France has indicated that there is no reason to have any worries about the health of this bank and I am happy with that , " he added .
Five - freaking - billion - dollars !
Dylan Stephen Jayne , from Pennsylvania , is seriously pissed at Google and he is seeking his dues .
The premise of his complaint revolves around the following assertion ;
" I , Dylan Stephen Jayne , plaintiff , has [ sic ] a social security number that when the social security number is turned upside down in its entirety it is a scrambled code that does spell the name Google® . "

Mr. Jayne had his best thinking hat on when he filed the case .
He thought that fact alone probably would not seal the deal for him .
The five pages , all hand written , further implicate that Google is responsible for compromising the safety of his identity , as they persist on using his social security number in coded form .
For good measure , Mr. Jayne accuses Google of not doing enough to fight terrorism , nor having any respect for his civil liberties .
As if the $ 5 billion would not be enough , additional requests include ; a gag order on all parties involved , the record to be sealed from the public and a block on any possible appeals process .
No doubt , Mr. Jayne 's balls are huge , unfortunately , it appears he also has balls for brains .
All we can say is ; good luck , Dylan .

The Short Run
A Dream Foreclosed
By Linda Pinkow
Rampant home foreclosures have made the headlines lately , but hidden on the back pages , or ignored entirely , is the wildly disparate impact on communities of color .
In its annual report for Martin Luther King Jr. Day , Foreclosed : State of the Dream 2008 , United for a Fair Economy found that " the subprime lending debacle has caused the greatest loss of wealth to people of color in modern U.S. history . "
The study found that people of color are more than three times more likely than Whites to have subprime loans , and comprise the majority of subprime loan recipients in many cities .
As the mortagage lending industry targeted people of color , �subprime loans became predatory loans . "
Among the many effects of the mortgage crisis , homeownership rates for Blacks are now declining compared to Whites .
Based on the rate of improvement from 1970 to 2006 , parity between the races will not be achieved for another 5,423 years .

Before Google There Was BackRub
Google ’s precursor in 1996 was called “ BackRub , ” a search engine research project headed by Larry Page at the computer science department at Stanford .
BackRub might have been a reference to the underlying algorithm which counts backlinks as affirmative votes , the same approach that was then turned into PageRank .
In August 1996 , according to a cached copy of the BackRub engine from C63.be , the number of “ HTML URLs ” this “ web search engine ” indexed was 75 million , with 30 million HTML pages downloaded by the crawler .
BackRub was written in Java and Python based “ on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux . ”
On the backrub homepage , Larry Page thanked Scott Hassan , Alan Steremberg and Sergey Brin for their help .
Larry Page was still pretty much the owner of the project at the point .
The hand in the logo was his own , scanned .
And as the FAQ stated , if there was any question unanswered , his email address and phone number were available for you to directly reach him .
Later , BackRub turned into “ the Google Search Engine , ” which may have looked like the following in 1997 , though it ’s quite possible the logo back then was different than the one in the screen shot :
I ’m using a gray background color as default as the HTML does n’t serve its own color , a color set - up which was n’t too unusual in 1997 , and the white background color on the logo may be another indicator the logo file as used by C63. be is n’t the original ( Google was not able to confirm this in either direction ) .
As the cached copy shows , searching Stanford was still a priority over searching the web – or at least , it was listed first .
Also , Larry and Sergey found themselves with 1.7 million crawled email addresses in their hand back then ... though utilizing those would have become quite a different , more shady business model than the one of search ads introduced in 2000 .

This week ’s “ Savage Love ” revisits a subject — an extremely touchy subject — that any intelligent advice professional know well enough to leave alone : “ a partner ’s premature and avoidable physical deterioration , ” as I delicately put it in this week ’s column .
The debate is over what can or ca n’t be said when you find you ’re no longer attracted to your partner due to weight gain .
( Short answer : Be honest and open and communicate — but only when the fatso is a man ) .
Now I find myself facing a similar issue at home .
My partner has radically , suddenly , and unnecessarily altered his appearance , and I am no longer attracted to him .
The situation is dire and I , the advice guy , do n’t know what to do .
My boyfriend has grown a mustache .
I did n’t think anything of it when Terry went a few days without shaving .
He ’s just being lazy , I thought , and things will soon return to normal .
But yesterday he returned from the gym having shaved most of his face — his cheeks , his chin , his neck — but not his upper lip .
The sight of him with a mustache has left me traumatized .
I am no longer sexually attracted to him — he ’s gone from looking like a steaming hot sex object to looking like one of my uncles .
That hairy thing on his lip trips some weird trigger for me ; my reaction to it is visceral and violent .
I can barely stand to look at my boyfriend , much less kiss him ….
or anything else him .
And I am at a loss for what to do .
Brutal honesty ?
I tried that .
( “ What the fuck are you doing ? ” “ Shave that thing off . ” “ Do n’t kiss me — gross — get away from me . ” )
But he is undeterred .
He told me at first that it was just for a week — he wants to wear it to some cosmic disco thing — but that was no comfort , I told him .
I want it gone this instant .
But now Terry is upset .
He ’s accusing me of being controlling .
He ’s telling me that he should be free to grow a mustache if he wants to grow a mustache because he ’s an adult and he ’s not my property and blah blah blah .
( His Visa bills , however , are my property . )
I ’m telling him that if I wanted to start a family with Joseph Stalin or Adolph Hitler or Burt Reynolds or Salvador Dali or Josh Bolton I would ’ve proposed to one of them .
My angry reaction to the appearance of this interloper on my beloved ’s upper lip has in turn angered Terry .
He now says that now he may not shave that thing off after the party this Saturday .
Maybe he ’ll keep it through the holidays — or until his birthday in March .
MARCH !
I am now threatening to retaliate .
My retaliation could take two possible forms : I dyed my hair blond once ( everyone should do it once ) and Terry absolutely haaaaaaaaaated it .
So I ’m thinking of dying my hair blond again .
Or I could come to bed ever night with a photo of a vagina taped to my forehead .
The second option comes closer , I think , to the effect that Terry ’s mustache has on me .
Since we ’re hopelessly deadlocked on both these issues — Terry ’s alleged “ right ” to grow a mustache and my insistence that he does n’t have a right to spring a mustache on me after 13 clean - shaven years ; and what form my retaliation should take — we ’ve decided to seek counseling .
Not from a couples ’ counselor , Slog readers , but from you .
I ’ve reported — at great length — and now it ’s time for you to decide :
The Mustache Issue
The Retaliation Issue
Polls close at 5 PM today .
Results are binding .
Einstein 's self - proclaimed " biggest blunder " -- his postulation of a cosmological constant ( a force that opposes gravity and keeps the universe from collapsing ) -- may not be such a blunder after all , according to the research of an international team of scientists that includes two Texas A&M University researchers .
The team is working on a project called ESSENCE that studies supernovae ( exploding stars ) to figure out if dark energy -- the accelerating force of the universe -- is consistent with Einstein 's cosmological constant .
Texas A&M researchers Nicholas Suntzeff and Kevin Krisciunas are part of the project , which began in October of 2002 and is scheduled to end next month after achieving its goal of discovering and studying 200 supernovae .
The team uses a 4 - meter diameter telescope in Chile during the observing season of October to December to find the supernovae .
In 1917 , Einstein was working on his Theory of General Relativity and was trying to come up with an equation that describes a static universe -- one that stands still and does not collapse under the force of gravity in a big crunch .
In order to keep the universe static in his theory , Einstein introduced a cosmological constant -- a force that opposes the force of gravity .
Then , 12 years later , Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is not static -- it is actually expanding .
So Einstein scrapped his idea of a cosmological constant and dismissed it as his biggest blunder .
In 1998 , however , two teams of scientists , one of which Texas A&M researcher Suntzeff co-founded , discovered that the universe is not only expanding , but its expansion is actually accelerating -- going faster and faster .
advertisement
" So there had to be some other force that had overcome the force of gravity and is driving the universe into an exponential acceleration , " Suntzeff said .
This opposing force is what scientists now call dark energy , and it is believed to constitute roughly 74 percent of the universe .
The other constituents of the universe are dark matter , which composes about 22 percent of the universe , and ordinary matter , which is about 4 percent .
" Eighty years later , it turns out that Einstein may have been right [ about a cosmological constant ] , " Krisciunas said .
" So he was smarter than he gave himself credit for . "
The type of supernovae that the ESSENCE team studies all give off the same amount of energy and have essentially the same peak brightness .
Researchers can compare the observed brightness of a supernova that they see in the sky to its known actual brightness to figure out how far away the supernova is .
Researchers also look at what is called the redshift of the supernova , which tells them how fast the universe is expanding .
When scientists compare the distance of the supernova to its redshift , they can measure the acceleration of the expansion of the universe .
This acceleration is caused by the force scientists call dark energy .
The ESSENCE team can then use the value of the acceleration to figure out the density of dark energy , which they then use to calculate what is called the w - parameter .
For Einstein 's cosmological constant to be correct , the w - parameter must equal - 1 , and so far , the results of the ESSENCE project seem to confirm that it is indeed very close to - 1 .
" The magic value is - 1 exactly , " Krisciunas said .
" If the number turns out to be precisely - 1 , then this dark energy is a relatively simple thing -- it is Einstein 's cosmological constant . "
The team wo n't have the final results until later next year , but right now , the measurement is coming in at - 1 plus or minus 10 percent error , Suntzeff said , so the initial data seems to point to Einstein being correct .
" We can never test [ dark energy ] in the laboratory , so astronomers have to measure it [ through observational data ] , and one of the ways we 're measuring it is with supernovae in the ESSENCE project , " Suntzeff said .
" Dark energy is completely unexplained by conventional physics .
Perhaps this is a manifestation of the 5th dimension from string theory .
Or maybe it is a new vacuum energy density that is changing slowly in time .
We have no idea , and that is what excites both physicists and astronomers . "
The next intelligent design showdown will take place in Florida , where opposition is mounting to state - mandated emphasis on the importance of evolution to science education .
The controversy comes on the heels of a Texas education official 's firing for forwarding an email critical of intelligent design , which holds that some phenomena are too complex to be explained except by Godly manufacture .
In a landmark court case in 2005 , intelligent design was officially designated as religion rather than science , but its proponents continue to fight .
In October , Florida proposed new standards for science education , designating evolution as something every student should understand .
" Evolution is the fundamental concept underlying all of biology and is supported by multiple forms of scientific evidence .
Organisms are classified based on their evolutionary history .
Natural selection is the primary mechanism leading to evolutionary change , " read the guidelines .
It was a big step forward : two years ago , when the Fordham Institute , an education think tank , gave Florida 's science curriculum a grade of F , the standards did n't even mention evolution by name .
But opposition is growing .
Just before Thanksgiving , four Polk County school board members said they do n't support the new standards and think intelligent design ought to be taught as a valid alternative to evolution .
Then state
Board of Education member Donna Callaway said she 'd vote against the standards .
Evolution " should not be taught to the exclusion of other theories of the origin of life , " she told the Florida Baptist Witness
weekly newspaper , adding her hope that " there will be times of prayer throughout Christian homes and churches directed toward this issue . "
A few days ago , state representative Will Weatherford , a leading candidate to become Florida 's House speaker in 2011 , voiced opposition to evolution .
" To show it from just one perspective and say this is more important or more accurate than the rest , I 'm not so sure I 'm in favor of that , " he told the St. Petersburg Times .
The Board of Education will vote on the standards in February .
In the meantime , the guidelines can be reviewed and graded here , and board members can be contacted here .
Should you happen to speak in favor of evolution and against intelligent design , you might want to pass along information about evolutionary theology – a theory that allows for both God and evolution .

Bizarre human sexual behaviors are nothing compared to the extremely weird sex life of the African bat bug .
These blood suckers are famous among biologists for a particularly horrible and cruel form of mating and now these insects have also revealed an odd secret to the researchers , " what could be the most extreme form of transexualism yet discovered " .
Male bat bugs do not have a " taste " for the vagina , but they pierce the female 's abdomen instead and ejaculate directly into the blood stream , where the sperm then moves to the ovaries to fertilize the eggs .
Females seem not to enjoy much being stabbed for sex and they have evolved a defense structure , a paragenital tissue on their abdomen that decreases the damage by heading the male 's sharp penile tip into a spongy area crowded with immune cells .
The team led by Klaus Reinhardt of the University of Sheffield , UK , made the research in a cave on Mount Elgon ( Kenya ) and was shocked to discover that males had been employing their " dagger " penises to hurt other males in an attempt to copulate , and as a result , many males wore scarred abdomens .
This triggered an evolutionary response : many males grow a male type of defensive paragenitalia , functioning like a protective shield against the penis attack of other males .
To turn the situation weirder , when the scientists checked 43 preserved female bat bugs , they discovered that 84 % of them carried the male type of genital shield .
It also resulted that the male version of the paragenitalia was more effective , as these females presented less scarring due to penetration than other females .
This is a " a spectacular example of evolution through sexual conflict , " said Reinhardt to New Scientist .
" Males started getting nobbled by other males , so they evolved the female defensive genitalia .
As this reduced the amount of penis damage they were getting , females evolved the male version of the male genitals . " he added .
Bat bugs are parasites feeding on the blood of the bats , and in their absence they can also attack people .
A close relative and more known is the infamous bed bug .
( CNN ) --
A search is under way for a pregnant 20 - year - old Marine who has been missing from Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , since December 14 .
Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she went missing on December 14 .
Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach could give birth at any time , Onslow County Sheriff Ed Brown told the Jacksonville , North Carolina , Daily News on Monday .
The sheriff 's department said Lauterbach 's mother said that her daughter , of Montgomery , Ohio , had witnessed an incident at Camp Lejeune and was to testify about it .
Sheriff 's department officials said evidence causes them to be concerned about Lauterbach 's disappearance , WITN reported .
The Marine 's car was found Monday at Jacksonville 's bus station , Brown told the Daily News , and her cell phone had been found at Camp Lejeune 's front gate on December 20 .

Investigators told the Marine Corps Times that a withdrawal from Lauterbach 's bank account was made on December 14 and said there was " suspicious activity " on the account 10 days later .
December 14 was also the last time Lauterbach 's cell phone was used , authorities told the Marine Corps Times .
The Raleigh News and Observer , citing Brown , reported that the woman 's mother said her daughter phoned home or her relatives up to 12 times a week and the mother became concerned when she did not hear from her daughter for five days .

Update :
This article has has a new home on programblings.com .

Comments are closed here but still open there :-)
James Golick wrote a very good article about testing a while ago .
In it he dissects ( and refutes ) the too often heard arguments where people say they do n’t write automated tests because they do n’t have the time .
In the comments , some people concluded that yes , they should try to write more tests , but did n’t know where to start .
In this post I wo n’t suggest frameworks , or specific tutorials .
I ’d just like to give one very first step that will help you write code that is easier to test .
You ’ll benefit from it even if you do n’t use a testing framework yet .
As the title suggests , what I ’m suggesting is pretty simple .
Write side effects free methods / functions .
Simple is n’t it ?
The rest of this article is just about explaining my point .
So if the light bulb went off already , you can stop reading now .
I ’m kidding , of course !
So let ’s not take anything for granted , instead let ’s make sure we ’re on the same page and define “ side effect free ” .
It means that a function ( substitute with “ method ” if you like ) receives parameters , spits out a result and has not touched anything outside of it .
There are two key parts to this definition :
The function does not depend on anything else than it ’s parameters : it does not expect a variable to be set outside of it to work properly ( at the object , class or global level ) .
It does not modify anything .
Its result can be entirely observed either from the return value or from the exception thrown .
Of course you often have to modify the state of the application as a result of a computation .
What I ’m suggesting is not a substitute for that .
What I ’m suggesting is simply to put the juicy bits of your computation in a side effect free function .
This part will be trivial to test , but you ’ll still have the code that uses this function .
That other part , which modifies the state of the app will need unit tests or other higher level testing .
Trivial examples of side effect free functions can be found in any good math library supplied with a language .
Of course no modern language expects you to set a global variable in order to compute a square root .
Those who want to follow the Ruby examples can do so on Try Ruby ( fear not , you ’ll be able to follow along even if you do n’t know any Ruby ) .
Math.sqrt(4 )
=> 2.0
And
Math.sqrt(-1 )
Errno:: EDOM : Numerical argument out of domain - sqrt
from ( irb ) : 6: in `sqrt '
from ( irb ) : 6
So there we have it .
The result of squirt is observed either from the return value or from the exception thrown .
We do n’t expect any state to have been modified anywhere else in the application .
I ’ll present a less trivial example in a bit , but first let me just say that the direct consequence of writing this kind of code is that you can test it trivially , whatever your technique of choice .
If you ’re in your debugger or in your interactive console , you can call it as many times as you want , with different parameters and check out if its behavior is what you expect .
If you use unit tests , you can code the interesting scenarios and verify their expected outcome , only in a repeatable manner .
Now since we all have a Math library of some sort in our language of choice , let ’s look at another example : analyzing the parameters that will dictate the execution of your program .
This is valid for configuration files with a bit more work , but let ’s keep the example simple and just analyze command - line parameters .
Most languages provide us with some kind of array of parameters when entering our main function .
The common way of dealing with them is to slap a big if or switch statement somewhere at the beginning of your program , which sets the state of the application accordingly , before actually starting to work on the application ’s main task .
A side effect free approach would be to split the process in two parts :
parse the parameters set the state / do some work
For example we could define a function that accepts an array and returns a hash ( a Dictionary for .
Net folks , a Map for Java folks ) of the execution parameters :
{
' arg1 ' => ' val1 ' ,
' arg2 ' => ' val2 '
}
So let ’s say we start with the following method to analyze our arguments ( to see the readable , indented version of this code , look at it on Pastie ) :
def analyze_args ( arg_list )
parsed_args = {}
# We check that each argument is in the form ' arg=value '
arg_list.each { |arg|
key , value = arg .split '= '
if ( key.nil ? || value.nil ? )
raise " Some arguments are not in the ' arg=value ' format "
end
parsed_args [key ] = value
}
return parsed_args
end
Now we can trivially test the parsing of the command - line params :
analyze_args ( [ " mom " ] )
RuntimeError : Some arguments are not in the ' arg=value ' format
from ( irb ) : 23 : in `analyze_args '
from ( irb ) : 20 : in `each '
from ( irb ) : 20 : in `analyze_args '
from ( irb ) :29
from :0
analyze_args ( [ " mom=food " ] )
=> { " mom " =>" food " }
analyze_args ( [ " mom=food " , " dad=car " ] )
=> { " mom " =>" food " , " dad " = > " car " }
Now that this part is taken care of , I can test it with whatever input I want , trivially .
To reiterate , in order to make your code easier to test , just extract the juicy bits of your program in side effect free functions and keep them apart from the rest of your program , which in turn makes sense of the result .
At least the side effect free parts will be trivial to test .
This is just the beginning of the testability and automated tests journey , however .
Of course you still have the rest of the program to test , preferably in an automated fashion .
Jeff Zucker , CEO of NBC Universal , did the opening keynote at the National Association of Television Program Executives in Las Vegas and talked about how — surprise , surprise — the industry is “ under pressure . ”
I ’ll bet that got some big laughs .
It ’s probably also not that surprising that he did n’t spend much time talking about the writers ’ strike and its effect on the industry , although he did drop in that old line about “ trading analog dollars for digital pennies , ” just for good measure .
The part that I found really striking , though , was near the end , where Zucker starts talking about how he thinks the system of making dozens of expensive — and ultimately futile — TV pilots is a dumb way to do things .
And when you listen to the numbers involved , it ’s hard not to agree :
The big five networks spent $ 500 - million last year on about 80 pilots , he says , of which only eight were brought back for a second season .
And even among those , “ none could be considered a big success . ”
What kind of crazy business spends a half a billion dollars on 80 prototypes , and gets less than 10 per cent that actually work ?
That might make sense if you ’re an experimental research lab — preferably government funded , so that your success rate does n’t actually matter — but should n’t the mass - market TV business have a bit better idea of what it ’s doing than that ?
I assume that every one of those was greenlighted by someone who hoped they would get a monster hit like CSI or Law & Order , and then they could afford to write off all the other losers .
If I were a TV executive , I would put down the crack pipe or whatever they ’re smoking over there and put some small amounts of money into a few Webisodes , or maybe look around at what ’s catching the eye of my target market at FunnyorDie.com or Break.com or places like that .
Finance some things on the cheap and then turn them into something when they take off — flushing billions of dollars down the drain on pilots in hope that you ’ll magically hit the CSI jackpot is insane .
When David Fahl worked for an energy reseller , which bought and sold energy from generating companies , he noticed that getting things done right was n't always as high a priority as making deadlines , meeting deliveries or being on budget .
" You can get all those things done without doing any good work , " he says .
It wore on him and did n't give him a sense of accomplishment .
" Not even the marketing people could come up with a plausible explanation for why the company existed , " he says .
In the information age , so much is worked on in a day at the office but so little gets done .
In the past , people could see the fruits of their labor immediately : a chair made or a ball bearing produced .
But it can be hard to find gratification from work that is largely invisible , or from delivering goods that are often metaphorical .
You can't even leave your mark on a document in increasingly paperless offices .
It can be even harder trying to measure it all .
That may explain why to - do listers write down tasks they 've already completed just to be able to cross them off .
" Not only is work harder to measure but it's also harder to define success , " says Homa Bahrami , a senior lecturer in Organizational Behavior and Industrial Relations at UC Berkeley 's Haas School of Business .
" The work is intangible or invisible , and a lot of work gets done in teams so it 's difficult to pinpoint individual productivity . "
She says information - age employees measure their accomplishment in net worth , company reputation , networks of relationships , and the products and services they 're associated with -- elements that are more perceived and subjective than that field of corn , which either is or is n't plowed .
Companies should create meaningful short - term goals .
Instead , " managers create all sorts of surrogate measures that they can measure , like PowerPoint slide counts and progress charts , " says consultant Tim Horan .
" The person doing the landscaping has a better sense of accomplishment . "
Jon Williams once worked in an auto - claims department where the number of new - claim calls , which could take a half hour , were tallied with the same weight as brief reminder calls to customers .
Even so , his greatest sense of achievement was transforming an initially angry and frustrated customer into someone who was satisfied and even laughing .
" That was n't measured at all , " he says .
The difficulty of putting your finger on what you 've accomplished gives employees pangs .
James
Ault recently visited a municipal park where he worked in maintenance while in college .
He saw the same signs he painted , the same electrical job he wired , and the same trees he planted 35 years ago .
Now , he works on state energy policy where he spends countless hours debating policy issues .
" I 've said to my wife on multiple occasions , ' It would be nice to be an electrician , ' " he says .
" You can take pride in what you 've accomplished . "
At closing time , work does n't seem completed , just temporarily abandoned .
As much as he loves his job , insurance broker Ryan Bowles envies Fred Flintstone 's exit from work in the quarry at day 's end .
" He seems so happy sliding down that dinosaur 's tail when the whistle - bird blows , " he says .
Similarly , Jane Vawter , a management consultant , is jealous of ground - control engineers celebrating their spacecraft 's first flight .
" That must be a tremendous feeling , " she says , " one I will never know . "
She has learned how to garner a sense of accomplishment from the work she produces , instead of the response it receives .
She loves to do needlework in her spare time just to control the process from start to finish .
The loss of such control over how and when a job is done is one reason the Industrial Revolution was resisted , says Gregory Clark , a professor of economics at University of California , Davis .
" It seemed like the complete destruction of the value of work to people , " he explains .
Consequently , many employers had to pay workers up to a 40 % premium to live under the employer 's control , he adds .
These days , we 're one step further removed from the finished product .
Employees have to wait for the gratification that comes with seeing a goal finally realized .
" The average delay is much , much longer for the average worker today , " says Robert Frank , a professor at Cornell 's Johnson Graduate School of Management .
And behavioral science notes we have difficulty with a reward delayed .
Maybe that 's why Home Depot 's aisles are packed with do - it - yourselfers and why a colleague is complaining of soreness from spreading mulch .
Mechanical engineer Robert Schneider at least gets to see the ball bearings he designed being produced in the manufacturing plant downstairs from his office .
But he spends a lot of time researching things that do n't directly translate into a finished product .
" Much of the work I do goes unnoticed by anyone but me , " he says .
" I need to rely on myself to know I am doing worthwhile work . "

Mentally Disabled Unarmed Woman Tortured and Shocked repeatedly with TaserOfficer denied using weapon , suspended after investigationSunday , December 2 , 2007 Amanda Beets is 28 years old , but she still refers to herself as a child , even when discussing her own little girl , Ashley .
As she recalls the events of March 21 , 2005 , when she was shocked repeatedly by a Knoxville Police Department Taser although she was n't fighting with officers , she describes the experience in the plainest of terms : " It hurt .
It really hurt .
" Beets lives in a small house on Connecticut Avenue in North Knoxville with her mother , Carol Dianna Lewis .
A bout with spinal meningitis when Beets was an infant left her with a speech impediment and impaired mental functioning , problems that have kept her from striking out on her own .
Lewis is anything but evasive when asked who started the chain of events that led up to the Tasing of her daughter :
She did , by leading Knox County deputies on a car chase that began in Halls and ended a few minutes later in her driveway .
She readily concedes that the deputies - and the two KPD officers who showed up at her house to provide backup - had every reason in the world to be scared and angry after the lengthy pursuit , which ended in her arrest on charges of evading arrest , driving on a revoked license and simple possession of marijuana .
Lewis said she understands that what she did was wrong .
What she does n't understand is why her daughter , who she says functions at the level of a 12 - or 13 - year - old girl , was hurt in the process .
When Lewis pulled into her driveway , she was swiftly taken into custody by the numerous officers who responded to the scene .
Beets was inside the house with Ashley but ran into the driveway after hearing several loud bangs that she mistook for gunshots .
Terrified that her motherwas dead or dying , she raced toward where Lewis was being subdued by deputies .
She began screaming at the officers .
She was grabbed by KPD Officer Brian Headrick , who was soon joined by KPD Officer Chad Riggs .
What happened next is unclear , although more than a dozen people were interviewed during the ensuing Internal Affairs probe .
Beets said she was kicked by someone and that Riggs used the Taser on her three times even though she was n't struggling with officers .
Riggs admitted that he got out of his cruiser with the Taser in his hand , although KPD 's rules at the time prohibited officers from deploying the weapons without getting a supervisor 's approval .
He said Beets seemed to be attacking Headrick and that during the melee , Beets ran into him .
He said he did not know if the Taser came in contact with Beets but that it was " possible , " records show .
" Headrick said Beets was yelling and ' flailing her arms around ' but did not try to attack him , " according to the IA report filed later on the incident .
" Hedescribed her behavior as ' disorderly ' and also said it was obvious by this point she was mentally challenged or ' there was something wrong with her . '
He said at one point he , Beets and Riggs were all in close proximity to each other and he ' heard a Taser going off ' ... for ' five or six seconds . '
" Beets was released without being charged , and Riggs later told Headrick that he had n't used the Taser and therefore did n't need to fill out a use - of - force report , records state .
Headrick reported his suspicions to his supervisors , who quickly contacted Beets and her family to find out whattheir accounts of the incident were .
Riggs ' supervisors were able to use a computer printout from Riggs '
Taser to confirmthat the weapon had been discharged three times , and a physician who examined Beets said she had " dual Taser burns on her upper back , chest , neck and on ( her ) breasts , " the IA report states .
Sgt. Keith DeBow , who heads KPD 's Taser training program , said " he felt it was ' highly unlikely ' that Riggs '
Taser could have been activated accidentally three times , " the IA report notes .
Riggs was later suspended for 10 days without pay after the IA investigation concluded that he'd used excessive force and failed to make a use - of - force report .
He resigned about six months after the incident .
Beets has since sued thepolice department , Headrickand Riggs for $ 1 million incompensatory and punitive damages in Knox County Circuit Court .
Headrick , who is still a KPD officer , could n't be reached for comment , and Riggs ' attorney , Richard W. Krieg , said he 's advised his client to not discuss the case .
KPD officials and Beets ' attorney , Herbert S. Moncier , declined to comment on the incident , citing the pending litigation .
Beets says she was traumatized both mentally and physically by the event and wants the police department to make sure that more officers like Headrick are encouraged to turn in officers who break the rules .
" I want to stop this before another kid gets hurt , " she said .
Lewis said that she has nothing but praise for Headrick , whom she describes as " one of God 's own . "
Lewis , who has a history of low - level criminal offenses , said that before the incident with her daughter , she did n't trust police officers to be moral .
But Headrick 's actions and the swift response of KPD supervisors , she said , convinced her that KPD genuinely wants to do the right thing .
When it comes to Riggs , however , Lewis is clear that an administrative punishment is n't satisfactory .
" I admitted I did wrong ; I pleaded guilty to what Iwas charged with , " she said .
" He assaulted my daughter .
... I would prefer that he was put in jail . "
LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) --
While health - care reform may play second fiddle to the war in Iraq among voters this election season , it appears that the domestic issue is taking on new life thanks to medical - industry professionals .
An advertisement , due to appear Monday in Iowa newspapers ahead of upcoming caucuses there , calls for a single - payer , national health - insurance plan similar to Medicare , and cites Vice President Dick Cheney 's chronic heart troubles as evidence of its need .
It is sponsored by the Oakland , Calif . - based California Nurses Association / National Nurses Organizing Committee .
At the top of the ad , there 's a news story about a recent visit by Cheney to the hospital for treatment of an irregular heartbeat .
Underneath , it says : " If he were anyone else , he 'd probably be dead by now . "
The ad goes on to note that under the government health - insurance program that covers Cheney , he is not turned away for preexisting conditions or unable to be treated for what an insurance company might label " experimental treatments . "
“ ' We 're trying to produce a dialogue .
We 're saying that what does not work is the status quo . ' ” — David Kinsman , American College of Physicians
" There 's a whole set of barriers that he has never faced , " said Michael Lighty , director of public policy for the nurses ' group .
Welcome to the 2008 elections , where medical professionals are turning up the heat in favor of a universal , single - payer system that represents a radical departure from what most of the major presidential candidates are proposing .
They know that such a system is a long shot at this point , but the numbers in their camp are growing .
Other medical professional organizations are calling for similar measures to be enacted , or at least discussed .
The American Nurses Association , which represents 2.9 million nurses , is pressing for a national plan , as is a group of 14,000 doctors called the Physicians for a National Health Program .
Dr. Quentin Young , co-founder of the physicians ' group , called alternative proposals from other candidates " patch - quilt failed systems that wo n't work . "
" What we have now is the problem , not the solution , " he said .
Also for the first time , the American College of Physicians wants the issue to at least be discussed among other alternatives as the nation moves toward some sorts of changes in health care .
The group , which represents 124,000 internal - medicine physicians , is n't advocating a Medicare - style plan , but at least wants the subject to be broached -- a departure from past practices .
" We 're trying to produce a dialogue , " according to spokesman David Kinsman .
" We 're saying that what does not work is the status quo . "
Can these professionals succeed in their quest for a national health program ?
Medical professionals are contributing in record numbers to candidates ' campaigns , so they 're likely to get the ear of at least some of the candidates .
The American Nurses Association said that it plans to sit down with all the candidates to discuss the idea .
' Outrageous '
The doctors and nurses who propose a single - payer plan say that it will cut red tape , eliminate haggling with insurers over what procedures are necessary and allow them to deliver unfettered health care .
Whether this kind of approach will resonate with voters is unclear , but staffers in Cheney 's office , at least , seem to have little patience for the nurses ' advertising strategy .
" I think it 's outrageous and it does n't warrant a response , " commented Megan Mitchell , a spokeswoman for the vice president .
But it appears that candidates for next year 's presidential election are unwilling to lean toward these views -- at least for now .
Currently , the only one that is calling for the same kind of reform is Rep.
Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , a dark horse who lags far behind in the polls .
Leading Democratic contenders Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and John Edwards , a former senator from North Carolina , all advocate a mix of public and private coverage .
Clinton and Edwards propose mandatory coverage for all , along with tax credits for those who can't afford premiums .
“ ' People are being ripped off , and these liberal Democrats are doing nothing to ease their pain . ' ” — Dr. Quentin Young , Physicians for a National Health Program
Republicans stray even further from the groups ' goals .
GOP candidates largely want to let free - market forces determine the future of health care , with only former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani calling for tax credits .
Young , of Physicians for a National Health Program , said that of the three major Democratic candidates , Edwards comes the closest to his organization 's views .
But proposals from candidates like Clinton are untenable , he added .
" She is ultimately duplicitous , " he charged .
" People are being ripped off , and these liberal Democrats are doing nothing to ease their pain . "
One problem for these stakeholders , though , is that they 're missing a key ally : the powerful American Medical Association .
While some say the AMA has softened its stance in recent years from the Republicans ' free - market approach , it still advocates a mix of public and private programs with tax credits thrown in -- much in the vein of the Clinton , Obama and Edwards plans .
AMA officials did not return phone calls .
" It is imperative that individuals and families be able to choose what health plan to join , " says an AMA February position paper on health care , posted on the group 's Web site .
Without the AMA 's backing , it will be tough to enact the kind of reform sought by medical professionals .
Still , they insist that along with the noise they 're making via the Cheney ads and other efforts , they 're also making progress .
" We 've moved from being irrelevant to being an undesirable alternative , " according to Young .
Nary a politician in the summer of ’06 was even slightly unsure why gas prices were punching through the $ 3 - a - gallon threshold :
The culprit was predatory , price - gouging oil - company executives – who obviously golf regularly with Dick Cheney .
Sen. Barbara Mikulski ( D - Md. ) was typical : “ It is often the large , vertically integrated oil companies that dictate the prices that gasoline retailers can charge . ”
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid agreed , and then some : “ The nation ’s eyes are focused on the big- oil companies ’ greed and enormous profits – the oil companies blame international tension and demand , and then increase their prices .
I blame the Bush administration . ”
The scene eerily resembled the Hill only a year earlier , when gas prices were skyrocketing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
New York ’s own Sen. Charles Schumer was one of many imploring the Federal Trade Commission to investigate , writing : “ We fear that some of the fluctuation and inconsistencies in gas prices are a result of price - gouging at the pump . ”
“ Price - gouging must not be tolerated , and we must do more to make sure that oil companies and gas -station owners are operating . . . within the law , ” he added .
Last summer , Congress again called on the FTC to investigate .
Last month , the agency issued its report .
The findings ?
Last year ’s spike was caused by . . . market forces .
That mirrors its 2006 report , which similarly found “ no evidence of manipulation ” in the post - Katrina price jumps .
The problem , instead , was a series of simultaneous events : climbing crude prices , refining capacity that had been reduced by storm damage and increased U.S. demand for gasoline .
That ’s not to say that only supply and demand are to blame .
The reports also finger congressional policies – specifically regarding ethanol .
Last summer , refiners were essentially forced to start using more of the corn- derived additive , nearly doubling its cost per gallon .
Demand for ethanol became so intense that refiners began importing almost 20 percent of their supply , despite a 54 - cent - a - gallon tariff .
Obviously , the added cost got passed along to the pump .
Not that these lessons are ever internalized :
When prices were rising this spring , Sens. Schumer and Hillary Clinton issued – what else ?
– demands for investigations into Big Oil .

Everyone seems to know that the most luxurious castles are located in Europe .
Or , are they ?
As we traveled the world we learned that castles exist everywhere .
From South Africa to Louisiana and from New Zealand to Iran , a curious traveler can find a castle in just about every corner in the world .
Just to prove this theory to you , we ’ve gathered twenty - five amazing castles from around the world for your perusal .
This selection represents some of the most intriguing castles in Europe , the Middle East , Asia , North America , and from around the world .
The oldest castle is being restored in Iran after an earthquake destroyed eighty percent of its buildings .
The newest castle was built during this century on a stretch of private land on the Sinai coast .
No matter when these castles were built , most of them are available to book for special events or as tourist venues .
So , you can always visit to see if the royal lifestyle is up your alley .
Although numbered , this list is not in any particular order .
So , the numbering does not indicate that we favor one castle over another or that they are listed in order of quality , size , or historic value .
Europe
It seems that you ca n’t turn around in Europe without bumping into a castle .
Europe is the heart of pomp and circumstance , and every country holds amazing stories about their palaces and fortresses .
But , if you can visit Europe only once , the following castles are on the “ must see ” list for your trip .
Once you see them , you ’ll realize that photographs do n’t do justice to the sheer size and luxury that were bestowed on these current and former residences .
Windsor Castle :
If you plan to visit England , you ’ll discover that you could spend months visiting all the castles on this island .
However , Windsor Castle is probably the most well known castle in the world , as – together with Buckingham Palace in London and Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh – it is one of the official residences of England ’s Queen and the largest occupied castle in the world .
This building and its complex have provided a home and fortress for royalty for over 900 years .
Originally made of wood , the castle was built for William the Conqueror to guard the approach to London .
The site sits above the River Thames , on the edge of a Saxon hunting ground and one day ’s march from the Tower of London .
Visitors can walk around the State Apartments , which are extensive suites of rooms at the heart of the working palace .
Once you ’re through with this castle , you can visit some of the top castles in Britain listed at the Travel Channel .
Those castles all come highly recommended , but do n’t forget to visit some of the smaller castles such as the one located in Dolwyddelan , Wales .
This castle is a lovely place to visit along the road from Betws - y - Coed to the western coast and provides a chance to view Mount Snowden , the highest mountain in Wales .
Castello di Strassoldo di Sopra :
While there are more magnificent and famous Italian castles , this choice is far from the maddening tourist crowd .
This castle is the ‘ upper ’ castle , which is located near the Castello di Strassoldo di Sotto ( “ lower ” castle ) , and both castles are located in northeast Italy .
Both castles also are privately owned by the Strassoldo family and have been in this family for almost one thousand years .
Since they ’re privately owned , they are n’t open to the public ; however , the owners open their halls for two fascinating exhibits in the spring and fall each year .
Additionally , important wedding banquets and other memorable events are personally organized by the owners .
The castle ’s splendid and fully furnished halls can host several hundred people , while the park can be used for open air buffets and wonderful photos .
The owners of the Castello di Sopra have recently restored a fifteenth - century small house called “ la Vicinia , ” which they rent out overnight .
This building and the castle are located in the heart of a lovely medieval village , surrounded by a centuries - old park that ’s fed by spring waters .
Frankenstein Castle : Darmstadt , Germany is home to the setting for Mary Shelley ’s Gothic horror novel , Frankenstein .
This castle was the 18th century home of Lord Konrad Dippel Von Frankenstein .
There are many theories about Dippel , including one that he sold his soul for eternal life .
In reality , Dippel was a highly controversial alchemist in whose laboratory the colour Prussian Blue was discovered .
Maybe his enemies tried to ruin his reputation with the legend about the monster created in his laboratory .
Visit Frankenstein Castle during Halloween to get the maximum scare factor , as an elaborate monster - themed theater show is performed , along with actors who lurk in the castle shadows .
If this castle is n’t enough for you , you can visit a few other German castles that might tickle your luxury bones .
Bran Castle :
This is another castle that the faint of heart might want to avoid !
Commonly known as Dracula ‘s Castle , the Bran Castle was originally a stronghold built by the Knights of Teutonic Order in 1212 .
The first documentary attestation of the Bran Castle is the act issued on 19 November 1377 , giving the Saxons of Kronstadt ( Brasov ) the privilege to build the Citadel .
The building started in 1378 as a defense against Turks and later became a customs post on the pass between Transylvania and Walachia .
From 1920 the castle became a royal residence until the expulsion of the royal family in 1948 .
Today it functions as a very attractive museum of medieval arts .
The official Romanian site will provide you with the lowdown on this country ’s castles , so be sure to visit that site if you plan to visit Romania .
Château de Versailles :
This castle complex is Louis XIV ’s masterpiece , a structure so magnificent that the state treasury was almost depleted during its construction .
Also known as the Palace of Versailles , and located now on the edge of Paris , this palace became home to French nobility during the seventeenth century .
As the complex grew through four “ building campaigns , ” Versailles became the center of French government .
Louis XIV lived at Versailles , and government offices , homes of thousands of courtiers and their retinues were built there , and nobles of a certain rank and position spent time each year at the court complex .
Louis XIV ’s attempt to centralize the French government succeeded , as few could match the ostentatious glamour represented by Versailles .
Visitors now can visit this UNESCO World Heritage Site and view luxuries such as the Hall of Mirrors ( pictured here ) and the magnificent gardens among other features .
The official Web site also contains a gallery and podcasts where individuals can learn about the castle before they actually visit .
If this castle is n’t enough for you , then visit this list of French castle sites .
Middle East
The most significant castles in this region include those created by the European Crusaders who arrived in the Middle East during the Middle Ages to protect Jerusalem ’s Holy Sepulcher .
All total , eight crusades were carried out between 1096 and 1270 , and an entire network of castles was built during this era that stretched from deserts in south Jordan to northern Asia Minor Mountains .
You can gain access to a map that shows the sites of the Crusader castles located in the Levant .
What this map does n’t show is the large percentage of castles built upon Byzantine architecture and with a strong influence from Armenian art .
These castles often influenced European architecture , which borrowed upon this Greco - Armenian influence .
On the other hand , an enterprising traveler could use this guide to soak in more than a handful of castles during a short trip .
We chose five of the best castles within this region that we feel you should n’t miss – including one that was built recently .
Krak des Chevaliers : T.E. Lawrence once described this castle , located in Syria , as “ the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world . ”
It is the easternmost of a chain of five castles intended to secure the Homs Gap , atop a 650 - meter - high hill along the only route from Antioch to Beirut and the Mediterranean Sea .
This castle and Beaufort , located in Lebanon as well , were the most important connection castles in the Middle East and they planed a major role in coastal defense for the Crusaders .
In 1142 the castle was given by Raymond , Count of Tripoli , to the Knights Hospitallers , and it was they who , during the ensuing fifty years , remodeled and developed it as the most distinguished work of military architecture of its time .
The castle remains one of the most complete pieces of military architecture dating from this period , and it holds some of the best preserved Crusader frescoes in the world .
The complex contains two concentric walls that sandwich a ditch .
The outer wall is an impressive three meters in width , and originally featured a dry moat and drawbridge and was designed to be able to withstand a siege lasting up to five years .
Three of the eight round towers were built following the Crusades .
Additionally , a chapel within this complex was later converted into a mosque .
Castle Zaman : Castle Zaman is perched atop a desert cliff midway between Taba and Nuweiba in Sinai .
The simple architecture provides amazing views over the Gulf of Aqaba , and into Israel , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , and Egypt .
The exact site signifies a landmark on the ancient road that connected St. Catherine ’s Monastery with Jerusalem .
But , while a distant perspective might fool your eyes into believing this is an ancient ruin , Castle Zaman was built along a local theme to accommodate the contemporary tourist market .
Used for honeymooners , parties , film or fashion shootings , the castle and its amenities are available for rent on a weekly or daily basis depending upon availability .
Zaman ’s private beach , with its pristine sand and crystal clear waters , is the only virgin beach left in the Taba and Nuweiba area .
Arg -é Bam Castle :
This enormous citadel , situated on the famous Silk Road , was built some time before 500 BCE and remained in use until 1850 CE .
It is not known for certain why it was then abandoned .
Located in Bam , Iran , this castle is the largest adobe building in the world .
The entire building was a large fortress in whose heart the citadel itself was located , but because of the impressive look of the citadel , which forms the highest point , the entire fortress is named the Bam Citadel .
It is listed by UNESCO as part of the World Heritage Site , but an earthquake in 2003 destroyed more than 80 percent of the buildings .
However , since it is a World Heritage site , several countries – including Japan , Italy , and France – have joined forces to reconstruct the buildings .
The World Bank has also granted a large sum of money to the restoration project .
Rhodes Castle : The Island of Roses , or Rhodes , is famous for its historic Medieval town , great shopping , and the site of the Colossus of Rhodes .
This ‘ castle ’ was built within the Old Town walls at the beginning of the 13th century CE by the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem .
The building is comprised of 205 rooms and a conference area that hosts summits for European and world leaders .
Today it attracts visitors from around the world as it houses the Archaeological Museum of Rhodes .
Rhodes lies between Crete and the near East along the Aegean ocean .
It is the largest of the Dodecanese islands and popular even among the Greeks as a holiday retreat .
Rhodes holds about sixty thousand permanent residents , and it is the financial and cultural center of the southeastern Aegean area .
The excellent tourist infrastructure that includes a wide variety of entertainment makes Rhodes a popular destination .
Kolossi Castle : The Kolossi Castle is stronghold located a few kilometers outside the city of Limassol on the island of Cyprus .
It held a great strategic importance and contained production of sugar , one of Cyprus ’ main exports in the Middle Ages .
The original castle was built about 1210 by Frankish military when the land of Kolossi was given by King Hugh I to the Knights of the Order of St John of Jerusalem ( Hospitallers ) .
It is a stone fortress and the baseground was probably used as a store with two underground cisterns .
You ’ll enter the first floor via a suspended bridge , and on the south wall of one of the two lower rooms there is a wall painting representing the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the Blason Magnac , which is testimony to the royal devotional use of this room .
The next room with the fireplace was likely to be the main dining and reception room .
On the second floor there are two more rooms , which were used for lodging .
On the roof of the monument , a scalding bowl and loopholes bring the thought of the visitor back to medieval sieges , along with the thought of boiling oil .
Former inhabitants of this castle include Richard the Lionhearted and the Knights Templar .
Asia
Like the Middle East , you can find maps that show castle locations throughout Asia .
One map , which illustrates castle locations in Japan , clearly demonstrates the proliferation of these Oriental castles in the southern region of the islands .
You also can learn about Japanese castles on a site written by a person who has visited over thirty Japanese castles .
Maps for Chinese castles are few and far between , but this country ’s marvelous architectural structures are beginning to enjoy global attention .
Korea also holds a number of castles .
Most of these buildings were created as fortresses with entire cities built within their enclosures , but many ‘ castles ’ in this region consist of temple - cities as well .
Forbidden City :
As the seat of supreme power for over five centuries from 1416 to 1911 , the Forbidden City in Beijing , China , contains four high towers on the four corners of the city wall .
This is a fort that contains a city , and the walls are approximately one meter thick .
Landscaped gardens and many buildings ( whose nearly 10,000 rooms contain furniture and works of art ) , constitute a priceless testimony to Chinese civilization during the Ming and Qing dynasties .
The Imperial Palace of the Qing Dynasty in Shenyang consists of 114 buildings constructed between 1625 – 26 and 1783 .
It contains an important library and testifies to the foundation of the last dynasty that ruled China before it expanded its power to the center of the country and moved the capital to Beijing .
This palace then became auxiliary to the Imperial Palace in Beijing .
Himeji Castle : Himeji Castle was originally built in 1346 by Akamatsu Sadanori as a fortification against local shoguns .
However , the castle has never seen battle , so it is the best preserved example of medieval castle architecture in all of Japan .
Himeji is a hill castle that employs the surrounding geography as a bulwark against an enemy attack .
The three moats – inner , middle , and outer – served as three lines of defense .
The building has expanded over the centuries , and now stands intact on a hill in the center of Himeji City .
It is surrounded by a tangled network of spiraling paths and high white walls and , in Japan , it is known as ‘ White Heron Castle . ’
In 1931 it was designated a national treasure .
After several aborted attempts , restoration work began in 1956 and was completed in 1964 .
It 1993 it was put on the list of UNESCO World Cultural and Heritage Sites .
The castle is said to be haunted by a servant girl named Okiku , who is said to have spurned a wealthy warlord ’s attention in favor of her true love .
Gyeongbokgung or Gyeongbok Palace : While Seoul , Korea , contains five castles ( or , palaces ) , this building may be the largest and most spectacular palace in Korea .
It was originally built in 1395 by Korean architect Do-jeon .
King
Taejo then added on to the building to make it the main palace of the Joseon dynasty .
The Japanese burned the building during an invasion in 1592 , and it was left in ruins until King Gojong restored the area in 1868 .
At one time there were 330 buildings in the palace complex .
Many of these are being reconstructed .
It is said that the Korean alphabet , known as Hangeul , was created inside this palace during the fifteenth century under the reign of King Sejong .
Angkor Wat :
The ruins of Angkor Wat are located amid forests and farmland to the north of the Great Lake ( Tonle Sap ) and south of the Kulen Hills , near modern day Siem Reap in Cambodia .
Although not a castle per se , Angkor represents the seat of the Khmer empire that flourished in this region from approximately the ninth to fifteenth centuries .
This period of rule began when the Khmer Hindu monarch Jayavarman II declared himself the “ universal monarch ” and “ god-king ” of Cambodia in about 802 CE until 1431 CE , when Thai invaders sacked the Khmer capital and caused its population to migrate south to the Phnom Penh area .
The temples are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and the main building , Angkor Wat , is said to be the world ’s largest single religious monument .
Many of the temples at Angkor have been restored , and together they comprise the most significant site for Khmer architecture .
With the help of satellite photographs and other techniques , an international team of researchers concluded in 2007 that Angkor Wat was the largest preindustrial city in the world , with an urban sprawl of 1,150 square miles .
The closest rival would have been the Mayan city of Tikal in Guatemala , which was roughly fifty square miles in total size .
Malacca A’Famosa :
When you go to the Web site linked here , you might wonder where the castle went .
Well , for the most part , all that ’s left of this sixteenth - century Portuguese fort is a tiny gate called the Porta de Santiago .
In 1511 a Portuguese fleet arrived in what was then known as Melaka in Malaysia , under the command of Alfonso de Albuquerque .
His forces attacked and successfully defeated the armies of the native Sultanate , and Albuquerque built a fortress near the sea .
This commander believed that Melaka would become an important link between Portugal and China along the Spice Route .
As Melaka ’s population grew , the fort was expanded around 1586 .
The fort changed hands in 1641 when the Dutch drove the Portuguese out of Malaysia .
The property changed hands once again in the early nineteenth century when the Dutch handed it over the British to prevent Melaka from falling into Napoleon ’s hands .
Knowing that they would need to hand the property back to the Dutch at the end of the Napoleonic wars , the British tried to make the entire city useless .
Sir Stanford Raffles , Singapore ’s founder , convinced the British to allow the population to remain , but all that remains of the buildings was the gate that stands today .
North America
Yes , Virginia – castles do exist in North America .
Canada holds the largest castles on this continent , but there is something to be said about a castle that ’s small enough to serve as a fishing camp .
The following five castles represent a handful of approximately one hundred castles scattered throughout this continent .
Chapultepec Castle :
When you ’re in Mexico City , Mexico , look up on the tallest point in the middle of Chapultepec Park .
You ’ll discover a building that has been used as a military academy , an imperial palace , an observatory , and a museum .
It currently houses the Mexican National Museum of History , but you may recognize it as the 1996 film location for the Academy Award - nominated movie , William Shakespeare ’s Romeo + Juliet starring Leonardo DiCaprio .
It is the only castle in North America that was occupied by European sovereigns .
Viceroy Bernardo de Gálvez ordered the construction of a country house on Chapultepec Hill in 1785 .
After a series of misfortunes and conspiricies , the municipal government of Mexico City purchased the building in 1806 .
The building went through more occupations and periods of disuse before President Lázaro Cárdenas decreed a law that established Chapultepec Castle as the seat of the National Museum of History ( Museo Nacional de Historia ) with the collections of the former National Museum of Archaeology , History and Ethnography .
Hearst Castle :
On the other side of the U.S. in California , you can find the home of newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst .
Located halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles , construction on this home began in 1919 on a 40,000 acre ranch that Hearst inherited from his father , George Hearst , and that was purchased originally in 1865 .
San Francisco architect Julia Morgan designed most of the buildings , but the estate was never completed during Hearst ’s lifetime .
He would tear down structures and rebuild them at a whim , making it difficult to complete the estate while Hearst had a hand in it .
Additionally , the estate is a mix of architectural fancies that Hearst enjoyed on his European trips .
The facade is modeled after a sixteenth - century Spanish cathedral , while the outdoor pool features an ancient Roman temple front that was transported wholesale from Europe and reconstructed at the site .
The indoor pool , shown here , is modeled after Roman baths with gold mosaic tiles .
The castle was donated by the Hearst Corporation to the state of California in 1957 , and it is a Sate Historical Monument and a National Historic Landmark open for public tours .
Casa Loma : Located in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , this castle was the former estate of Sir Henry Pellatt , a prominent Toronto financier , industrialist and military man .
Construction on this castle began in 1911 , and it took 300 men and nearly 3 years to complete at a price of over three million dollars .
Pellatt enjoyed the castle for about one decade before he declared financial ruin .
The city seized Casa Loma in 1933 for $ 27,303 in back taxes .
While one critic called the mansion “ a mixture of 17th century Scotland and 20th Century Fox , ” many visitors tour the decorated suites , secret passages , an 800 - foot tunnel , towers , stables , and five - acre estate gardens .
The house was commissioned to Canadian architect .
E.J. Lennox and , at 98 rooms , it was the largest private residence in North America upon completion .
Many of the rooms were left unfinished , and today serve as the Regimental Museum for The Queen ’s Own Rifles of Canada .
Frontenac Castle : The Frontenac Castle is actually a Fairmont Hotel that is located in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada , about one - half mile from Quebec ’s parliament .
Although the Fairmont Le Château Frontenac is actually a hotel , it is as symbolic to Quebec as the Eiffel Tower is to Paris .
This Renaissance style castle was build in less than a century by the Canadian Pacific Railway company .
With its castle - like architecture and turrets , Fairmont Le Château Frontenac plays a huge role in the heart of the city ’s activities , and it has been designated a United Nations World Heritage Site .
It may be difficult to book a room in 2008 , as this year represents Quebec ’s 400th anniversary .
Fisherman ’s Castle : Anyone who ’s driven along I - 10 between the Mississippi - Louisiana border and New Orleans in the United States has seen this small and simple castle sitting on the other side of Irish Bayou .
Contractor Simon Villemarrette built the ‘ home ’ in 1981 and he based it upon a fourteenth - century French castle .
He purposely built the castle with round turrets and with enough concrete to withstand 140 mph wind gusts .
Unfortunately , Villemarrette died before he could occupy the home .
This building did survive Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with little damage other than the chunks cut from the sides by flying debris .
Jon Digman currently resides in the home as a caretaker , but it ’s unknown who owns the home or what the future of this castle holds .
The image shown here was taken in 2007 , so it ’s obvious that any damage created by Hurricane Katrina has been repaired .
This little replica goes to show that any home can be a castle .
Around the World
The following castles are n’t as grand as those found in Europe or even in the Middle East or in Asia .
But , for their owners and inhabitants , they represented all that was powerful , protective , and princely .
And , the castle in Colombia , South America , would rival many European castles in sheer size .
Many of the ‘ castles ’ located around the Caribbean were forts that housed a city complex complete with soldiers .
On the other hand , some of the castles shown here were meant as private homes .
Yet , these latter buildings are spacious enough to host large functions .
Stollmeyer ’s Castle : Modeled after a wing of Balmoral Castle in Scotland , and created by the Scottish architect , Robert Gillies from the firm of Taylor and Gillies , this fantastic residence is definitely under Scottish influence .
However , it ’s located far from Scotland , as the home is located in Port - of - Spain in Trinidad .
The wife of the original builder , Charles Fourier Stollmeyer , did not like the house , so it was passed to the Stollmeyer ’s son , Conrad C. Stollmeyer .
Mr. and Mrs. Conrad Stollmeyer lived at the house until their deaths in the 1960s , and the house then passed to the Stollmeyers ’ only son , Dr. John Stollmeyer .
In March , 1972 , John Stollmeyer sold the home for $ 215,000 to Jesse Henry A. Mahabir , an insurance executive .
The building was to be used for residential purposes only .
The building was acquired from Mr. Mahabir by the Trinidad and Tobago Government in 1979 .
If you ’re visiting Trinidad and Tobago , you might want to take in this home as well as six others that make up this country ’s Magnificent Seven architectural treasures .
Larnach Castle : Visiting New Zealand ?
If you plan to spend any time in this area , then you ’ll want to visit this country ’s one and only castle .
Australian - born William Larnach , merchant baron and politician , built this home for for his first wife in 1871 .
Over 200 workmen spent three years building the Castle shell and master European craftsmen spent a further 12 years embellishing the interior .
Larnach spared no expense on this dream home , which features the finest materials from around the world .
The building is the centerpiece of a 35 - acre property atop a hill midway along the Otago Peninsula , eight miles from the city of Dunedin on the east cost of the country ’s South Island .
Still privately owned , the Barker family celebrated their 40th anniversary with Larnach Castle in 2007 .
Weddings , balls , official and formal functions and celebrations are held often in the home ’s 3,000 square foot ballroom .
But , be aware that this castle is haunted by both the first and second Mrs. Larnachs , and daughter Katie .
The specter of Larnach himself might linger , as he shot himself in the head in 1898 when he learned that his young third wife was embroiled in an affair with one of Larnach ’s sons from his first marriage .
Castillo San Felipe del Morro :
Over two million visitors a year explore theme windswept ramparts and pageways in this fortress / castle , where the history of 400 years of Spain in Puerto Rico comes alive .
Begun in 1539 by Spanish settlers to defend the port of San Juan , El Morro ’s architecture follows well established Spanish military fortification design principles .
Similar Spanish fortifications from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries can be seen on islands throughout the Caribbean and in Florida in the U.S. Named in honor of King Philip II of Spain , the Castillo was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in 1983 and is part of San Juan National Historic Site .
Castle of Good Hope : The Castle of Good Hope was built in Cape Town , South Africa , between between 1666 and 1679 , which makes this castle complex the oldest surviving building in this region .
The current pentagonal fortification replaced a small clay and timber fort built by Commander Jan van Riebeeck in 1652 upon establishing a maritime replenishment station art the Cape of Good Hope for the Dutch East India Company , better known as the VOC ( Verenigde Oos- Indische Compagnie ) .
In 1936 the Castle was declared a National Monument .
As a result of an extensive , ongoing restoration and conservation program launched in the 1980 ’s , the Castle of Good Hope remains the best preserved of its kind built by the VOC in regions where it had interests .
The Cape of Good Hope houses the regional headquarters of the South African Army in the Western Cape , the famous William Fehr Collection of historic artworks , the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for traditional Cape Regiments .
San Felipe Castle : Castillo de San Felipe , Cartagena , Colombia , South America , was founded in 1533 .
This forted castle is a walled city and a World Heritage site .
It took slave labor over a century to build this fortress that dominates the landscape and that protected residents from pirates .
The fortress is thought to be Spain ’s most successful military engineering project in the Americas .
Built from red brick and concrete , this citadel is designed so even if one part of the fortress fell to invaders ( which never happened ) , the defenders could fire from another part .
Its size is startling , and visitors begin to realize this building ’s magnitude when they begin to explore the underground tunnel network .

Target to the blogosphere : you ’re irrelevant .
That was the message the cheap - chic retailer seemed to convey in an abrupt e-mail message to ShapingYouth.org , a blog about the impact of marketing on children .
Early this month , the blog ’s founder , Amy Jussel , called Target , complaining about a new advertising campaign that depicted a woman splayed across a big target pattern  the retailer ’s emblem  with the bull ’s - eye at her crotch .
“ Targeting crotches with a bull ’s - eye is not the message we should be putting out there , ” she said in an e-mail interview .
Target offered an e-mail response :
“ Unfortunately we are unable to respond to your inquiry because Target does not participate with nontraditional media outlets , ” a public relations person wrote to Shaping Youth .
“ This practice , ” the public relations person added , “ is in place to allow us to focus on publications that reach our core guest , ” as Target refers to its shoppers .
Mauro Morales picks his way through mesquite trees and prickly pear cacti .
The 65 - year - old cautiously steps around a thicket of tasajillo , or rat - tail cactus , just down the road from his small ranch near Rio Grande City .
Tasajillo thorns stick you like a fish hook , he says .
Then there 's the cola seca — the rattlesnake — another job hazard .
" We 're far enough from a hospital that you probably would n't make it if you got bit , " he says in a quiet voice , as though a snake might take his words as an invitation to strike .
Morales has been wandering through the chaparral for half an hour , staring at the ground .
He combs over small rocks with a stick .
Finally , he spots a greenish knob , sprouting out of the ground under the tasajillo thicket .
" There 's some medicine , right there , " he says .
It 's a lone peyote button , about an inch in diameter , way too small to harvest .
It 'll be another five years before this peyote is mature .
As he navigates the hostile flora , he points to three more small peyote plants , all of them too young to cut .
" I used to collect as much in a week as I now do in a month , " he says .
" I do n't know what 's going to happen to the medicine . "
Morales almost never utters the word " peyote . "
For him , the small green - gray cactus is a sacrament with miraculous healing powers , hence his word for it : ­medicine .
What makes peyote different from just about any other cactus in the world is that it naturally produces mescaline , a psychedelic alkaloid that can induce hallucinations lasting for days .
It was mescaline that opened what Aldous Huxley called " the doors of perception " to " the divine source of all existence . "
Before LSD , before Ecstasy , there was peyote .
Peyote and mescaline are both classified by the federal government as Schedule I Controlled Substances .
This puts them in the same legal category as crack and heroin , drugs that , according to the DEA , have " a high potential for abuse , no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States , and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision . "
Much recent scientific research contradicts the DEA 's verdict on peyote .
There is little evidence for any adverse long - term effects on physical health and virtually no evidence that it is addictive .
Still , harvesting and selling peyote is illegal for all but three people in the entire country .
And those three people happen to be located in Texas , operating in a swatch of South Texas between Rio Grande City and Laredo .
These people — Morales is one of them — are called peyoteros , people who make their living selling peyote buttons to the approximately 250,000 Indian members of the Native American Church .
Only 20 years ago , there were dozens of peyoteros in small towns along the border .
Now , two of the three still working are in their sixties .
Meanwhile , membership in the Native American Church is growing and demand for peyote is outstripping the limited supply .
For Native American Church members , this 70 - mile stretch of land used to be known as the " peyote gardens " — the only place on U.S. soil where the cactus grows in its natural habitat .
" I talk to the medicine every day , " Morales says .
" I pray to it .
I know it works and I want to help the Natives in any way I can . "

In his 1976 doctoral dissertation , " Man , Plant and Religion : Peyote Trade on the Mustang Plains of Texas , " the geographer George Morgan speculated that Hispanic traders first bought peyote from a Mexican tribe called the Huichol .
To this day , the Huichol harvest the cactus during their annual 250 - mile pilgrimage from their homeland in the Sierra Madre to a sacred mountain in central Mexico .
The pilgrimage takes them four weeks by foot and along the way , in the desolate Chihuahuan desert , they eat peyote , hunt deer and train a new generation to become ­shamans .
The Huichol , unlike most tribes , were never quite conquered by the Spaniards .
They resisted Christianity and continue to practice an animist religion based on mystical beliefs about peyote , deer and corn .
Morgan discovered that Mexicans brought peyote across the border and started trading it with marauding Indian tribes from Oklahoma in the late 19th century .
These tribes then passed on the cactus to other Indians to the north and west .
Soon , Indians from California were arriving in South Texas in search of the fabled peyote ­gardens .
Anglo authorities did n't look kindly upon the Hispanic - dominated peyote trade .
In 1909 , a U.S. Special Officer named William " Pussyfoot " Johnson bought up all the peyote in South Texas and burned it .
According to Morgan , the operation worked for almost a year , until Johnson ran out of money .
The Bureau of Indian Affairs convinced the Post Office to ban peyote sent by mail in 1917 , but the ban had little effect since most Indians preferred to travel to the peyote gardens themselves .
The Post Office lifted the ban a few years later .
After these early conflicts , Anglos mostly shrugged their shoulders and left peyoteros to their business , which was starting to flourish .
Indians from Oklahoma started arriving on the Texas - ­Mexican railway with empty burlap sacks , which they would fill with thousands of buttons of dried peyote .
In some places — such as the now - deserted town of Los Ojuelos — the peyote trade was the basis of the entire economy .
The peyoteros had a natural monopoly on their crop .
Even though it 's illegal to cultivate , there have been sporadic attempts to transplant the cactus to Oklahoma and New Mexico , all to no avail .
In the United States , peyote will only grow in the hot , dry climate of South Texas .
The peyoteros remember a time a generation ago when Indians camped out and harvested their own peyote .
" Back then , it was what we call open range , " says Salvador Johnson , another peyotero .
" You could harvest what you needed .
At that time , ranchers were poorer than we were .
They could n't even afford feed for the cattle .
Now those same ranchers are multimillionaires from oil and gas royalties . "
( Click here for a video interview with Morales and Johnson . )
Like many peyoteros , Johnson was a little mystified when peyote suddenly became trendy in the late 1960s and into the 1970s .
It was during this time that the drug caught on among hippies and New Age folk , largely through the works of Carlos Castaneda , an anthropologist - turned - best - selling author .
Castaneda wrote a series of books about a shaman named Don Juan Matus , a Yaqui Indian who took the anthropologist under his wing .
Don Juan believed that " mescalito " — a code word for peyote — was a vehicle for self - knowledge .
Through mescalito , Don Juan said , one could learn how to fly and see beings in liquid colors .
Under Don Juan 's tutelage , the rational academic learned how to become a sorcerer and warrior .
Castaneda 's books were a phenomenon .
The author , however , turned out to be a fraud .
He was denounced by fellow anthropologists for trying to pass off a fictional character as an authentic source .
In a cover story in Time in 1973 , the magazine presented evidence that the author had lied about his background , including his nationality .
None of this , however , stopped the influx of peyote - seekers in the one place in the nation where the plant grew wild .
Poachers started arriving , many of them Anglo hippies from the West Coast .
One of those poachers was Frank Collum ( not his real name ) , a hippie from Connecticut who had heard about the peyote gardens through some Indian friends in New Mexico .
When he first started going to South Texas in the early 1970s , he would hop a fence and camp out for a week .
Now , he does n't think it 's worth the risk of getting caught for trespassing .
Collum still goes down to South Texas , but his Indian wife buys dried peyote from Salvador Johnson .
( In addition to belonging to the Native American Church , peyote buyers have to prove they are at least one - quarter related to a federally recognized Indian tribe . )
Collum raised his son in the Church , going to meetings that would include all - night ceremonies in a teepee .
Those days are gone .
" Peyote is in jeopardy , " he says .
" You hear stories about it coming from Mexico now .
The ranchers in Texas have put up tall fences you can't jump .
Then , there are all the wetbacks and Border Patrol .
There 's just too much heat . "
" A lot of the Natives are real sensitive about the situation , " Collum says .
" The supply will not meet the demand unless you can convince the ranchers to cooperate .
And the ranchers , they do n't give a fuck about peyote . "
Ranchers used to be friendly with the peyoteros , who paid them a small lease for access to their land .
In recent years , as land prices have skyrocketed and Hispanic immigration has boomed , Anglo ranchers have come to view the peyoteros as a nuisance .
According to Morales , many ranchers would rather root - plow their fields to plant grass for cattle feed than protect their native plants .
Salvador Johnson used to be a full - time peyotero , but now it 's a part - time job .
Rather than fight the ranchers , he 's started helping them organize hunting trips .
He also works as a general contractor around his hometown of Mirando City , a hamlet about half an hour east of Laredo .
" The big money is in deer hunting , " says Johnson .

Mauro Morales remembers when it was possible to find massive clumps of peyote growing wild .
" There was medicine just a couple miles from my home , " he says .
He grew up on the same street where he still lives in a ramshackle , two - story pink house with a dirt driveway .
As a young man , he worked in the fields harvesting peyote for extra money .
The matriarch of the peyote trade , a woman named Amada Cárdenas , first showed him peyote in 1950 .
" Natives call the big ones ' chief , ' " he says .
" And when they find a chief , they get down and pray to it .
Miss Cárdenas showed me my first chief . "
Morales says that it 's getting harder and harder to find chiefs .
The only way to ensure the supply , he says , is greenhouse cultivation , something he 's discussed with botanists from around the world , including a group from Germany that visited him in January .
But Johnson , the only remaining peyotero in the once - thriving area east of Laredo known as the Mirando Valley , does n't believe cultivation will solve the peyoteros ' problems .
" Even if we buy the land , we do n't have control of peyote because God put it here , " he says .
" We do n't know how it grows , how it multiplies .
God will give us what we need , and that 's it .
He 's the one who makes the rain .
He 's the one who makes the peyote . "
Johnson says that the tipping point for the peyoteros was the mid-1970s .
As ranchers struck oil and gas , seemingly worthless South Texas scrubland became expensive .
Many peyoteros found more lucrative work in the oil fields .
Others were getting old and retiring .
Stringent requirements for a peyote license , which include a letter of recommendation from the local sheriff , stopped a lot of young people from becoming peyoteros .
Johnson had returned from the Vietnam War and was n't sure he wanted to continue the family tradition .
He quit selling for a while in 1976 .
" We were selling peyote and making a profit , but I had to make sure I was doing the right thing for my family , " Johnson says .
" In the late 1970s , there were so many drugs on the market we had never seen before — angel dust , PCP , reds , yellows , blues .
Then , the DEA classified peyote as a Schedule I substance .
There were a lot of landowners who started to think peyote was a dangerous drug . "
Johnson , a 60 - year - old with a white moustache who looks like a well - tanned Wilford Brimley , was n't sure he wanted to be associated with a drug most people thought was harmful and addictive .
" I said to myself , that , for me to continue to doing what I 'm doing , I need to understand this drug , " he said .
" I needed to have an understanding with my family that I was doing the right thing .
I wanted to understand its effects on health . "
So Johnson went to visit an Indian he'd known his entire life named Leslie Full Bull .
For a few months , Johnson lived on a reservation in South Dakota and got to see for himself the long - term impact of peyote .
He came away believing that the plant was a positive thing for the community .
" I 'm really involved with the Native American Church , " he says .
" I 'm so involved with it that I believe that I 'm one of the smartest people in the world about peyote .
I 've been to Montana , South Dakota , North Dakota ...
Name a state , name a tribe of Indians that use peyote , I 've been there . "
The real test , though , was a firsthand experience of peyote in a Native American ceremony — a meeting .
" I got so involved in these meetings that the only way for me to understand what this peyote does is to take it . "
According to Jody Patterson , supervisor of Controlled Substances Registration with the Texas Department of Public Safety , peyoteros have to follow the same rules regarding peyote as everyone else .
If they are n't one - quarter Indian and a member of the Native American Church , it 's illegal no matter if it was taken as part of a religious ceremony .
Johnson , who says he's " probably " part Indian — " most Mexicans are " — has been taking peyote for " many , many years " and sees the legal niceties somewhat differently .
He says he takes peyote only after it has been blessed by a high priest .
He expects that the Indians he sells to will do the same .
" I can only hope that you 're using it the right way , " Johnson says .
" Now , if I know you 're using it the wrong way , I can report you and you 'll be arrested . "

Martin Terry is a Harvard - trained botanist at Sul Ross State in Alpine who may be the world 's leading authority on peyote .
He runs a small nonprofit called the Cactus Conservation Institute , which is dedicated to saving peyote from extinction .
" I 've become increasingly passionate about the conservation of cacti in the past ten years , " he wrote in a recent e-mail .
" I 've personally witnessed species becoming scarce in places where I had previously found them to be abundant . "
Terry is afraid that the natural habitat for peyote in South Texas is being ruined by ranchers and poachers .
" The problem is defined by access to land , " he says .
" The peyoteros are Hispanic .
They work through family connections .
More and more of the land is being bought up by Anglo owners who do n't derive any benefit from the peyoteros .
They do n't give a damn about the peyoteros . "
For the first time in history , Terry says , there 's active patrolling of ranch grounds .
Ranchers have cut back brush to allow trucks to ride along their fence lines .
Ranchers want to protect against peyoteros getting in and deer getting out .
The ranchers ' hands - off policy represents a dilemma for Terry .
On the one hand , protection against peyoteros will conserve the cactus .
One the other , it prevents Indians from getting access to their sacred plant .
" From the point of view of the plant , the only threat is overharvesting , " he says .
" The fences and personnel that protect ranch lands from would - be harvesters are the very opposite of a threat , as the protected populations of peyote inside those fences are the only healthy ones in South Texas . "
Still ,
Terry is sensitive to the peyoteros and their way of life .
He considers Mauro Morales a personal friend .
He wants to make sure that Indians have access to their cactus , but that 's getting harder and harder .
" Everyone I talk to , they say peyote is getting more expensive , " Terry says .
" The buttons are getting smaller .
It 's now about 30 to 35 cents a button .
Ten years ago it was a third of that . "
As a botanist , Terry thinks he 's found a solution — buying up land to protect the plant .
But the price of land has ­skyrocketed .
" The only obstacle is the cost of buying a minimum of 2,000 acres of South Texas real estate , " he says .
" That means we 're talking about something on the order of $ 2 million .
For a relatively new 501 ( c ) 3 like the Cactus Conservation Institute , that 's a fund - raising project of enormous ­magnitude . "
It 's also a challenge raising money to save a plant that the federal government considers a dangerous , addictive drug .
But the biggest obstacle for conservation might be the Indians themselves .
Many Indians are opposed to cultivating peyote in greenhouses .
Their opposition stems from a mystical belief in the cactus as divinely planted .
Alden Naranjo , a Ute who 's been traveling to the peyote gardens from Colorado since the 1960s , is n't too worked up about the disappearance of his sacred ­sacrament .
" Peyote predates Christianity by thousands of years , " he says .
" Native Americans have their spirituality based in this sacrament .
It came north to us from Mexico .
I do n't think it will disappear .
We 've used it for thousands of years and it 's still here . "
Naranjo , like Salvador Johnson , does n't want to see peyote grown in greenhouses .
He would rather see it imported from Mexico , where 90 percent of the continent 's supply grows .
For Native Americans like ­Naranjo , the current crisis in the peyote supply is just the latest story in a history of injustices .
" It 's just the white man 's greed , " he says .
" The white man wants more land and that discourages peyoteros .
It 's getting harder for us , with stricter trespass laws . "
It was n't always like that in Texas , he says .
" A lot of that land was open .
Before the oil speculators , land was cheap .
Then the white man with his European concept of ownership came in .
There 's just too many white men . "
There are , in fact , white members of the Native American Church .
Frank Collum is one , and he 's been welcomed into meetings by Indians .
It took him a while to be accepted , but now that he 's married to an Indian and a veteran of peyote meetings , he feels like he 's just as much a part of the Church as anyone .
In the eyes of the law , however , it is illegal for Collum — or any non-Indian — to buy or consume peyote .
According to James Botsford , an attorney who has been defending peyote use by Indians for decades , there 's a clear distinction between Indian and non-Indian peyote users .
The law , he says , protects Native American Church members who can prove they have one grandparent from a federally recognized tribe .
There have been recent challenges to the law on First Amendment grounds .
One case made it to the Utah Supreme Court , but the ban on peyote use by non-Indians remains .
" I 'm comfortable with the law as it stands , " says Botsford .
" There 's not enough peyote around to allow a broader interpretation of the law .
Indian people understand peyote to be the flesh of God , something that the creator put here to help them pray . "

A year ago , Mauro Morales started losing weight .
He always looked forward to February , when busloads of Indians descended on South Texas for meetings in the peyote gardens .
Suddenly , though , he did n't have the energy to go hunting for medicine with his sons .
Morales is a small man who has always weighed about 125 pounds .
" I was all skin and bones , " he says .
" I was down to about 97 pounds . "
The doctors could n't give Morales a clear diagnosis .
They told him he needed to rest , so he spent most of his time on the couch .
When the Indians arrived in February , they were shocked to learn that he could ­barely walk .
" The Indians kept saying , ' We need you , we need you , ' " Morales says .
One Indian from South Dakota called Morales and told him he would be down to his place the next day .
The man had been visiting Morales for decades , and like many Indians , he had formed a friendship with the peyotero .
The Indian brought 20 people to pray for Morales in his little peyote garden behind his house .
In the garden , Morales has clumps of old peyote — chiefs — as well as ultrarare specimens of the star cactus , a super - potent , highly endangered plant in the same family as peyote .
Morales 's Indian friends often set up their teepees on his ranch about half an hour outside town to conduct their ceremonies .
This time , though , the 20 Indians put the teepee behind Morales 's house .
It 's not the most tranquil spot for a campout .
The neighborhood is abuzz with ranchera music , crowing roosters and belching pickups .
But the Indians wanted Morales to participate in the meeting , which goes from dusk to dawn with constant drumming , singing , praying and — of course — peyote eating .
" I was so sick , " Morales says , " I did n't think I could make it in the teepee — you 've got to be in there all night long .
I got up at 5 a .m. to go out .
I did n't want to go back in .
It 's so hot in there and I 'm sweating . "
Still , he went back in .
Morales , who had spent the majority of his life working around peyote , had never used it .
Now , with his Indian friends praying over him , he took the medicine .
" I 've only taken it when I 've been real sick , " he says .
Days later , Morales started gaining weight .
He got off the couch and was able to walk without pain .
He 's not sure how it worked , but he 's convinced that the medicine — along with the Indians ' prayers — healed him .
Now , when they come back to Morales 's place , he cuts them a deal , selling them bags of peyote at $ 200 a piece , which amounts to a significant discount from his regular price of $ 350 .
" You 've got to have faith in the medicine , " he says .
" Without faith , it wo n't work . "
Morales says he 's seen the medicine work for others as well .
The most miraculous case he 's seen happened when his brother was dying in the hospital .
A doctor called Morales to tell him the brother had two days left .
Morales started calling his family .
At the same time , a group of Indians were visiting him to stock up on peyote before heading back to Arizona .
" One of them told me to write my brother 's name on a piece of paper , " he said .
Morales wrote the name — Ajeo — and the Indians left .
He did n't ask the Indians ' names because he did n't believe it would work .
" They told me not to worry because my brother was n't going to die . "
The family gathered at the hospital , thinking that it would only be a matter of hours .
Days passed , and Ajeo held on .
He did n't die for another six months .
Weeks after the Indians left , one of them called Morales .
" He asked how my brother was doing , " he says .
" I said that he was still alive .
He said it was the medicine .
They were praying for him . "
Other terminally ill people have turned up at Morales 's door , looking for medicine .
He would like to be able to help them , but if he deals to the wrong people , Morales 's license to sell peyote could be revoked .
" One woman drove here from San Antonio , " he says .
" She had been taking chemo and it was n't working .
Nothing had really worked for her and someone had mentioned the medicine .
But she did n't have the papers , so I had to turn her away . "
" If you do n't have papers , I ca n't sell to you , " he says .
Then , with a little smile , he adds , " but I can tell you where you might find it . "
As Morales explains the magical power of the medicine , he inspects his supply .
So far , business has been slow for the winter .
It was still deer season in early January and Morales could n't harvest much peyote if he wanted to .
He sold about 5,000 buttons for December , which means that he netted around $ 1,750 .
Subtract wages for his handful of part - time workers and it becomes clear that Morales is n't making much money , even though the price of peyote has more than doubled in the past ten years .
He keeps thousands of buttons ready to sell .
Stored in large wooden trays behind his house , some of them are covered by tarps and others by a makeshift roof .
There 's little security to protect his supply , but he says he 's never had a problem with theft .
Morales bends down to demonstrate his technique for cutting the plant above the root so that it will grow back .
He puts a button on a table and cuts a slice open .
He offers it to me to smell .
He gives me a little nod as if to indicate that I should try it .
Without asking permission , I take a bite .
Morales smiles .
It tastes like a dirty , raw potato .
The little button seems to suck all the moisture right out of my mouth .
Suddenly , it starts tasting spicy , like a raw jalapeño .
The feeling is intolerable and I spit it out .
" Maybe you just do n't have the faith , " he says , winking at me .

Humberto Fernández — known universally as Don Humberto in the village of Real de Catorce , Mexico — eats peyote for breakfast .
One button — it 's just enough to get him going for the day .
Don Humberto was a young Mexican hippie bumming around California in the 1970s when he heard about peyote growing wild near a ghost town in the mountains of central Mexico .
As it turned out , the ghost town — Real de Catorce — was close to his hometown in the state of San Luis Potosí .
" I was hanging out in the esoteric sections of bookstores in California and reading about the Huichol Indians and peyote , " he says .
" I said , ' wow , that 's where I 'm from . '
I did n't know anything about it growing up . "
On a whim , Don Humberto moved to the town and started renovating a colonial building a few blocks from the cathedral .
He turned it into a boutique hotel that catered to Europeans who had heard about peyote .
About ten years ago , primarily through word of mouth , peyote tourism in the town boomed .
Before he knew it , Don Humberto was hosting Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts , who came to town to film The Mexican .
He points to a corner of his restaurant where Brad Pitt ate breakfast every morning for two months .
Don Humberto , with his aquiline nose and stringy black - and - grey beard , looks like a Hollywood character actor — the classic ethnic bad guy .
His involvement with The Mexican led to a bit part in the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie , but his heart is still in Real de Catorce , where he 's the most recognizable face in town .
" I came here as a dropout , " he says .
" There was nothing in town when I arrived .
There was one lady on the corner who sold rice , beans and eggs .
That was it .
People asked me why I was coming here , but I had a dream , a vision . "
( Don Humberto has plenty to say over here . )
About 90 percent of the town 's economy revolves around tourism .
There is n't much to see in the town — an old church , some crumbling colonial architecture , and abandoned silver mines .
The sacred mountain of the Huichol , Wirikuta , is just an hour 's horseback ride away .
While most of the locals embrace the new peyote tourism , it also attracts some unsavory characters .
On street corners , young men harass foreigners for a " ride in the desert . "
For about $ 70 , they 'll take tourists out to the peyote gardens below the mountains .
It 's technically illegal , but no one seems to care much .
As Don Humberto says , peyote tourists are the core of the town 's livelihood .
He 's hoping that Indians longing for the lost peyote gardens of South Texas will work their way to his little village on a mountaintop .
He 's already seen a few relocate to Real .
An Indian from San Antonio bought a house and lives there part - time .
Then Don Humberto and his Swiss wife , Cornelia , met a group of Indians near the Four Corners , who promised to come .
" They said they had a vision that was leading them down here , " says Cornelia , who was attracted to Real 20 years ago , in part because of peyote .
" But peyote 's not for everyone , " she adds .
Cornelia and Don Humberto see peyote tourism as both a blessing and a curse .
When tourists first started arriving in big numbers , local police preyed on them .
" Police used to harass foreign tourists , " Cornelia says .
" They 'd take watches and cameras as bribes .
Now , they leave everyone alone . "
She says that there 's an unspoken agreement that police will never go into the desert looking for peyote seekers .
" But , " she says , " if you take it out and get caught with it , you could go to prison . "
The Mexican government also has ambivalent feelings about the foreign influx .
It has designated the area around Real de Catorce as a Natural and Cultural Reserve , protected under UNESCO .
Although the government wants to promote tourism to the region , it also passes out flyers warning peyote seekers that the collection and trafficking of the cactus can be punished with up to 25 years in prison .
On the other hand , there 's a long history of peyote 's use as a folk medicine in northern Mexico .
Mexicans have been using peyote as a cure - all for rheumatism , arthritis and other ailments for centuries .
They drink it in teas or rub it directly on the skin .
Martin
Terry says that even here in San Luis Potosí — the peyote heartland — the cactus is endangered .
He says that the National Autonomous University of Mexico ( UNAM ) — the biggest and most prestigious university in Mexico — keeps GPS data on clusters of peyote plants around the sacred area of the Huichol .
Last summer , someone ripped huge roots from the area .
They squeezed the mescaline out of the cactus and left the roots to die .
He thinks it may be a drug cartel .
" Only six years ago , it was a place of great abundance , " he says .
When he went back this summer , " there were just a few plants left .
Those that were of no value were left to die . "
Frank Collum , the Anglo peyote eater and sometime poacher , says that Native Americans should back off the Mexican peyote gardens .
" If it keeps going like it is , " he says , " there 'll be a war with the Huichol .
They eat an incredible amount of peyote .
They 've got their own problems with the Mexican government . "
One local from Real de Catorce , Juan Hernández , makes his living taking foreigners to the sacred places of the Huichol on horseback .
He charges about $ 20 per horse and serves as a guide .
Hernández is a mestizo who lives in town , but he has close ties to the Indians .
" They call me before they start their pilgrimage in April , " he says .
" It takes them about four weeks to walk here and when they get here , I have firewood and food ready for them . "
Hernández guides three horses straight up a mountaintop to a spiral of stones .
It 's not much of a monument , but the landscape is breathtaking , with a view of the Chihuahuan desert stretching as far as the eye can see .
Hernández says that this is the birthplace of the god of the sun , Quetzal .
He rubs coins across his body — it is a symbol of cleansing — and enters the stone spiral .
When he gets to the center , he places the coins on a mound of other offerings .
There are old shoes , a driver 's license , candles , and Mexican and U.S. coins .
" This is a place of spiritual renewal , " he says .
( Click here for video footage atop Mount Wirikuta . )
Hernández follows many of the Huichol practices — including peyote eating .
He prefers to mix it with chocolate or fruit juice so he 's not likely to vomit it back up .
He likes it because it gives him energy .
He believes — like the Huichol — that the peyote ceremony on Wirikuta releases the shamans ' spirits from their bodies .
He 's seen their spirits flying around the mountains like large , colorful birds .
But he 's not immune to the transformations going on in his hometown .
His eyes light up when the name Brad Pitt is mentioned .
" He was so cool , " Hernández says .
" We all hung out with him for two months when he was n't filming . "

Mauro Morales looks a little worried when he talks about Mexican peyote .
He knows that there 's much more medicine on the other side of the border , but he 's not crossing the river to seek it out .
Even though he 's a licensed dealer , transporting the stuff across the border would land him in jail .
And he 's skeptical of the Mexican police .
" You do n't want to get caught with medicine over there , " he says .
" In Mexico , you 're guilty until proven innocent .
Here , you 're innocent until proven guilty . "
Still , like many people following the decline of the peyote trade in Texas , he hopes that , someday , he might be permitted to import peyote into Texas .
But time may be running out for him .
Morales says that he knew he was getting older when Indians started calling him " grandpa " a few years ago .
Morales gets part - time help from his sons harvesting peyote in February , when deer season ends and Indians start arriving .
But one son has a full - time job and the other is more interested in his hobby of cockfighting than in picking medicine .
Morales has his eye on his 14 - year - old grandson , Angel , who 's doing well in school and has good manners .
Angel might be able to take over the family business someday .
But he 's not sure .
" The medicine might be extinct in 25 years .
Then everyone will have to go to Mexico . "

Mr Zebari said any incursion would be a violation
Mr Zebari interview
Hoshyar Zebari told the BBC that the current crisis was " dead serious " and accused Turkey of not seeking a peaceful solution .
He said Turkey had shown no interest in Iraqi proposals to calm the situation .
Turkey has 100,000 troops near the border and is threatening to attack the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) in Iraq .
The group frequently launches deadly attacks on Turkish troops , and is accused by Ankara of using the Kurdish semi-autonomous area of northern Iraq as a safe haven .
Mr Zebari said Turkey demanded that Iraq hand over senior members of the PKK sheltering in Iraq , a request he said was impossible to fulfil .
" They are not under our control , in fact .
They are up in the mountains , they are armed , " he said .
Collision fear
He said there was nothing to stop Turkey taking action against PKK bases in the remote and rugged border mountains .
THE PKK Formed in late 1970s Launched armed struggle in 1984 Dropped independence demands in 1990s Wants greater autonomy for Turkey 's Kurds Leader Abdullah Ocalan arrested in 1999 Ended five - year ceasefire in 2004 Called a terrorist organisation by Turkey , the EU and US
Mountain meeting with PKK
But the massing of an estimated 100,000 Turkish troops - with tanks and other heavy weaponry - raised fears that the Turks were planning something bigger and deeper into northern Iraq , Mr Zebari said .
Such a step would have " disastrous consequences " for stability in both countries and in the wider region , he added .
" This would be a unilateral decision and that 's why people are resisting that .
" That 's why the whole government of Iraq and the whole people of Iraq are united really not to see their sovereignty , their territorial integrity undermined by a friendly neighbouring country . "
The BBC's Jim Muir , in Baghdad , says there are fears of a collision between Turkish troops and the Iraqi Kurdish forces which control the area .
The Kurdish north of Iraq is a semi-autonomous area run by the Kurdish Regional Government , led by Masoud Barzani .
Speaking to al - Jazeera TV , Mr Barzani insisted he would not hand over anyone to Turkey , but added that he would also not allow the area to be used as a base for a rebel group .
Last week a Danish court ordered the ISP " Tele2 â €³ to block its customers access to The Pirate Bay .
The decision heated the debate on ISPs Internet filtering , and it now turns out that filtering traffic to The Pirate Bay is actually illegal according to European law .
In last week ’s court ruling it was concluded that “ Tele2â €³ had assisted in copyright infringement because they give their customers access to The Pirate Bay , thereby copying copyrighted material in their routers .
It reads : “ The telephone company ’s dissemination of access to the www.thepiratebay.org entails the transmission of copyright protected material through the companies routers . ”
A crucial factor in the ruling is thus that the ISP commits copyright infringement in their routers when they allow access to The Pirate Bay .
An absurd claim of course , and even more serious , it opposes the Infosoc Directive , that formed the basis of the Danish copyright law .
In in Article 5 of the Infosoc Directive it is clearly stated that “ copying in routers ” is allowed , as an exception to and a limitation of the rights holders ’ exclusive rights .
Even more so , this is non-negotiable , and every member state of the EU must accept it .
Oscar Swartz , an Internet pioneer and writer in Sweden who has been researching the case extensively rightly argues that the Danish court misinterpreted the Directive in this case .
The misuse of the article in question has been confirmed by Cecilia Renfors , a Swedish judge and special governmental investigator who had the assignment to propose new legislation to combat unauthorized file - sharing .
“ She refers to the former opinion by the Swedish government and reconfirms that a Danish model would NOT be compatible with Article 5.1 in the Infosoc Directive .
She also repeats the opinion that the Danish way actually nullifies the whole purpose of that Article , ” Oscar writes .
The Danish ISP Business association has decided that they will challenge the decision in court .
Ib Tolstrup , the director of the association said in a podcast interview with Computerworld that Tele2 is going to challenge the ruling , as they realize they are the only nation in Europe that talks about “ copying in the routers ” .
Tolstrup further said that , if Denmark wishes to be a top IT nation , the topic must be put on the political agenda because a Google block is not far away if they do not challenge the courts decision .
In a comment to TorrentFreak Swartz said : “ I am surprised that the Danish ISPs have simply accepted the rulings in Denmark when they are so obviously illogical and dangerous .
The courts say that any network provider performs “ copying ” in their routers .
If that is correct the consequences are enormous and The Pirate Bay and the two other cases in Denmark would just be the beginning . ”
Swartz continues : “ I think the case shows that we have to fight all the time .
Stand up .
Not back down .
Work hard .
Make research .
Try to get the message out to media .
What I miss in Sweden , and Denmark of course , is professors and lawyers who are also participating in the fight for communications freedom .
Like in the EFF in the U.S. where top professors and lawyers donate time and knowledge to support cases in court .
Where are they here ? ”
In a response to the courts decision , The Pirate Bay launched jesperbay.org .
The site is named after Jesper Bay , the head of the Danish IFPI , and gives detailed instructions for affected customers on how to regain access to The Pirate Bay .
Interestingly , it turns out that the block by Tele2 did n’t have the effect that the IFPI was hoping for .
On the contrary , Pirate Bay traffic from Denmark went up , instead of down .
However , this case is about more than The Pirate Bay , it is about censoring the Internet .
VILLIERS-LE-BEL , France , Nov. 27 — Dodging rocks and projectiles , the police lined the streets of this tense suburb Tuesday where angry youths have vowed to seek revenge for the deaths of two teenagers who died in a weekend collision with a police car .
Police union officials warned that the violence was escalating into urban guerrilla warfare , with shotguns aimed at officers — a rare sight in the last major outbreak of suburban unrest , in 2005 .
More than 80 have been injured so far — four of them as a result of gunfire — and the rage was still simmering Tuesday afternoon .
Inside the city hall of Villiers - le - Bel , a group of visiting mayors appealed for calm while police officers dodged rocks outside .

“ We are sitting targets , ” said Sophie Bar , a local police officer who stood guard outside .
“ They were throwing rocks at us and it was impossible to see where they came from .
They just came raining over the roof . ”

California home prices still unaffordable Survey finds it takes more than median income to afford one
Despite recent declines in the cost of California real estate , median home prices remain unaffordable throughout the state , according to a report by a liberal research and advocacy group calling on the governor and state lawmakers to confront the issue .
The authors of " Locked Out 2008 : The Housing Boom and Beyond , " the study released today by the California Budget Project of Sacramento , said median incomes are n't enough to buy median - priced homes in every county it studied , 36 of the state 's 58 .
The report assumes homes are out of reach if households have to dedicate more than 30 percent of their income to housing costs , the level above which the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development says people may have difficulty affording necessities such as food , clothing and transportation .
More than half of homeowners with a mortgage exceed that level in California , according to a 2006 survey by the U.S. Census Bureau .
The lack of affordability is acute in the Bay Area , where the earnings required for purchasing a median - priced home is more than double the median household income in every county but Contra Costa and Solano , the California Budget Project said .
" While the softening ( real estate market ) has put tens of thousands of families out of their homes and many thousands more are threatened with foreclosure , it 's actually had little effect on housing affordability , " said Scott Graves , senior policy analyst with the group and lead author of the report , during a conference call .
" Housing continues to be out of reach for many California families . "
The housing downturn and credit crisis sparked by last summer 's rising default rates have driven down the state 's median price for new and resale homes and condos by 16.9 percent , from $ 484,000 in May to $ 402,000 in December , research firm DataQuick Information Systems said .
But that 's offered little relief for residents who saw prices rise more than 140 percent since March 2000 , when the median stood at about $ 200,000 , and nearly 200 percent from 1989 , the California Budget Project said .
Conditions are n't much better for the state 's renters , who pay the second - highest rates in the nation , behind Hawaii .
California 's monthly median rent is $ 1,029 , according to the Census Bureau survey .
Several things could exacerbate these problems .
About 190,000 subprime loans in California as of mid-2007 could result in foreclosure , the California Budget Project said , citing estimates from the Joint Economic Committee of Congress .
In addition , about 93,000 units of federally subsidized rental units in California could see rents go up to market rate by 2017 as expiring contracts allow owners to opt out of the government program , the report said , citing the California Housing Partnership Corp .
To address these challenges , the Sacramento group called on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Legislature to , among others things :
-- Create a dedicated funding source for the construction of affordable housing , possibly by raising fees on documents processed by county recorders .
-- Withhold transportation and infrastructure funds from cities that do n't comply with a state law requiring local governments to create plans for accommodating their fair share of regional housing .
-- Increase efforts to aid homeowners facing foreclosure by connecting them with counselors .
-- Require lenders to freeze introductory interest rates on subprime adjustable - rate mortgages , follow sound underwriting standards and curb deceptive lending practices .
-- Make surplus state property available for building housing for the homeless .
Sabrina Lockhart , deputy press secretary for Schwarzenegger , said the administration has already completed or is pursuing several programs along these lines .
The Republican governor recently announced the distribution of $ 69.5 million in permanent low - interest loans from housing bonds to 14 affordable multifamily projects , including three in the Bay Area ; completed an agreement with four major subprime lenders to maintain initial interest rates for certain borrowers facing higher interest rates ; and directed the Department of Housing and Community Development to draw up recommendations for securing a permanent funding source for affordable housing .
" The governor has been aggressive and proactive in multiple efforts to increase affordable housing in the state and also pledged to work with lawmakers in the coming year to provide better protections to home owners , " Lockhart said .
Joseph Perkins , president and CEO of the Home Builders Association of Northern California , said the California Budget Project 's suggestions do n't address the two root causes of California 's expensive housing : strict regulations and high fees .
Developers commonly argue that the state 's environmental rules , drawn - out approval processes and charges for public benefits like parks and affordable housing all pump up the costs of building homes .
" If our impact fees were comparable with what they are in Texas , then we would be offering houses that the average - earning household here in the Bay Area could afford , " Perkins said .
Out of reach
The cost of homes in the Bay Area is so high , it takes much more than the median income to afford one .

So I did a little bit of digging and I ’ve pulled together something fun : I call it “ The World of ECMAScript “ .
It ’s a full map detailing everything that exists within the world of ECMAScript ( with JavaScript , ActionScript , and JScript being its most - famous implementations ) .
Right now I ’m only showing things that can be built on top of ( languages , engines , browsers , servers , etc. ) – not end user applications ( there would probably be too many to list ) .
This chart started out as a simple diagram showing the relationship between ActionScript , Tamarin , ActionMonkey , and SpiderMonkey .
From there I started tacking on additional relationships and it just sort of started to grow out of control .
I ’m fascinated by the size and breadth of everything in that exists in the ECMAScript ecosystem ( and this is n’t even everything , I ’m sure I ’m missing a ton ) .
Here ’s some links for more information :
Languages :
Engines :
Applications :
Hooks / Convertors :
Companies :
Implementation Languages :
Let me know if there ’s anything that you feel that I ’ve missed .
I ’ll use my discretion when adding , simply because I do n’t want this to include every half - baked ECMAScript implementation under the sun ( and I still have to modify it by hand ) .
Update 3 am Nov. 15 : Removed WebKit ( was redundant ) , added Silverlight , added IronPython and IronRuby , connected PDF to SpiderMonkey , and fixed spelling of Konqueror .
Presto is wrong for Opera , but not sure what their JS Engine is named .
Compressed PNGs , added an SVG download .
Update 5 pm Nov. 15 : Turned JavaScript into a language / cloud .
Added ParenScript , YHC / JavaScript , Haxe , and Scheme2JS .
Added CouchDB. Silverlight now links to JScript .
Opera ’s two engines ( futhark and linear_b ) are listed .
Added Flex .
Changed QSA to QT Toolkit .
Why " Where everyone goes " crashed
A note for my foreign readers
Malcolm Tredinnick asked me to translate into English my Friday 's post about our experience of launching a Django project under high load .
So here it is , hope this will be useful :-)
I believe some context is also required .
Yandex is the biggest Russian search engine and service portal that started to look into building its services using Django last year .
I 'm working there as a lead architect on the interesting project " Where everyone goes " .
This is a social network for people to organize themselves to spend some leisure time together : movies , art galleries , concerts , clubs , etc .
This is by far our biggest Django project in Yandex .
Last Thursday we 've crashed under a stream of traffic coming from a teaser on our mothership 's index page .
Now read on for the rest of a " war story " !
As many attentive readers of this blog noticed :-) , the morning after launching a teaser our wonderful service showed a strange face and refused to work until the teaser was removed .
So yesterday and today we were trying to figure out what went wrong with it .
And it looks like we 've succeeded :-) .
I am now in an interesting mental state of wondering why it was so bad and hopeless that Thursday while now it 's all so simple and obvious ...
However only the next teaser can prove us right .
First of all some numbers for the sake of statistics .
Though as you 'll see later they do n't mean that much .
We 're running on a cluster of 4 machines ( CPU Xeon , 4 cores , 2.3 GHz ) where we have litgttpd , Django and memcached .
On the back there is a single DB server running MySQL .
We managed our traffic well all the night and most of the morning when we had about 55 requests / second on one host .
Then between 10 and 11 am .
we started to feel worse while the traffic has grown to more than 300 requests / second after which we 've ... oh , well :-(
First - class problem
During the whole Thursday many participants of the process had many various ideas about the issue .
But to the middle of the day today one of them had crystallized and now I 'm pretty sure that it was the main reason of such a bad performance .
The problem was in the usage of sessions ( not in them per se though but in the way we used them ) .
These are very standard sessions that come with Django .
In general Django 's sessions are made smart enough — while stored in a DB they do n't touch it at all if your application does n't write anything in them .
Unfortunately we used them in an interesting manner .
We store there one - off user messages that are shown once and then removed .
For this we had this code in a context processor :
messages = request.session [' messages '] request.session [' messages ' ] = [ ] # ← a killer line !!!
The second line here clears messages by effectively writing to a session .
And since it is in a context processor it was executed on every request .
Well , not exactly on every request but rather only on those when we get a new user .
However since we had a teaser on Yandex 's index page practically all our users were new .
One may , nevertheless , suppose that even at the rate of 1200 requests / sec MySQL on a good hardware should handle the task .
There were two particular features of the session table that did n't let it happen :
as all tables in our DB it used InnoDB engine
it has a md5 hash for the primary key instead of auto - incremented integer
If I get this thing right , InnoDB tables physically rebuild themselves upon each new inserted record according to the order of the primary key .
This is why , evidently , they are being queried fast .
And in the usual case with auto - incremented integer key this does n't cause any problems since a new record is added at the end right where it should be anyway .
But since we have a key that is random we had each new record inserted somewhere in the middle which caused reconstruction of the table .
It is being reconstructed in slices which given such ' chaotic ' writes leads to fragmentation which slows writing more and more .
Our admins say that at the worst moments a single write in a session table had taken about 6 - 7 seconds !
Finally , at some moment the growth of quantity of new requests has become faster then the speed of handling them .
All attempts to revive the service were hence futile , because the further we went , the slower it was running .
This is what I meant saying that performance characteristics do n't mean much : it 's useless to measure speed with such an anchor .
So we had two lessons out of this ( surely pretty obvious for many ) :
do n't create sessions when you do n't need them
never store Django sessions in an InnoDB table
By the way ...
The bitter irony of the story is that we in fact do n't use this messages subsystem .
The service was killed by a feature that did n't exist .
Second -class problems
We have brought the service back to life by moving sessions into an in - memory table ( and also by removing the teaser :-) ) .
But in - memory table did n't let sessions live very long either : it has quickly outgrown some storage space and in the evening our service has crashed again .
So we moved them back on disk .
And now we just got rid of that " killer line " altogether .
But an overloaded database allowed us to see other problems .
Though they are n't nearly as severe as the first one we will fix them anyway because sooner or later we 'll run into them as our audience will grow .
Problems we learnt were :
" Dog - pile " effect .
Our index page consists mostly of cached blocks that are produced using relatively heavy queries .
When the cache record becomes stale the next request would cause its regeneration .
And while this regeneration was n't complete all subsequent requests would execute these same queries for regeneration .
If the regeneration time is long enough and the number of requests is big enough they would create an additional load that further slows down the regeneration speed making the situation gradually worse .
We can't read from DB replicas yet which would otherwise allowed us to relieve the master that was busy writing sessions and would allowed as to stay a little longer :-) .
And also one of the queries on index page involved a join of four table one of which is the largest table in the database :-) .
Strategy
Yesterday everything looked very bad : we 're limited by performance of database writes which means in the world of relational DBMS that we can't scale wide ( i.e. by adding machines ) .
We have to rewrite something and artificially partition the database somehow and this is hard and painful .
But today just by removing writing to sessions we managed to turn the situation upside down .
On a test stand consisting of one frontend and one DB backend we can load the frontend up to 80 LA while the DB is loaded up to 2 - 2.5 LA .
Which means that now we do n't have a bottleneck on the database .
We can just add frontends and I think we wo n't overload database very soon .
We 'll try to evaluate this more precisely on Tuesday when we plan to stress - load the system of two frontends and one database .
To solve the second - class problems we plan in particular :
Use MintCache to avoid dog - pile effect .
I 'm about to write a " mysql_cluster " db backend for Django which will use replicas for reads .
Looks like it can be done as a self - contained package without hacking Django 's core .
We will continue to denormalize DB schema to avoid heavy queries .
Watch for new episodes !
The son of an English mother and Jamaican father , so - called " shoe bomber " Richard Reid was born in 1973 in the London suburb of Bromley .
I was not there to give him the love and affection he should have got
I was not there to give him the love and affection he should have got
Richard Reid 's father
It is hardly a natural breeding ground for dissidents - the borough 's schools are among the UK 's best , and street crime is half that in smarter areas such as Kensington and Chelsea .
The young Reid is said to have attended Thomas Tallis secondary school in Blackheath , south - east London , from 1984 to 1989 .
His father , Robin , told BBC News he had been in prison for most of Richard 's childhood .
" I was not there to give him the love and affection he should have got , " he said .
His son fell into a life of petty crime and in the mid-1990s was jailed for a string of muggings , for which he served sentences in a number of prisons , including Feltham young offenders ' institution in west London .
It was while at Feltham that Reid is said to have converted to Islam .
Worship
After his release , he followed the path taken by many other Muslim prisoners , to Brixton Mosque , in south London .
The place of worship has a reputation for attracting converts and helping ex-offenders re-adjust to life in the outside world .
Initially he fitted in well .
Taking the name Abdel Rahim , he became known for his willingness to get involved in the workings of the mosque and to learn Arabic .
But at some point Reid began to get involved with extremist elements , says the chairman of Brixton Mosque , Abdul Haqq Baker .
Reid was " tempted away " by " individuals who set up a few years ago away from the mosque " , Mr Baker says .
" Their teachings were a lot more militant . "
He says extremists worked on " weak characters " and believes Reid was " very , very impressionable " .
Reid attended external classes and started to question the peaceful philosophy of his teachers .
Change in appearance
His appearance also changed , says Mr Baker .
He went from wearing western clothes to the traditional Islamic thobe - a loose , long - sleeved , ankle - length garment - with a khaki combat jacket on top .
There is speculation that at some point during his drift to a more extreme philosophy , he may have met Zacarias Moussaoui , who has been charged in the US with conspiracy over the 11 September attacks .
Mr Moussaoui , a Frenchman of Moroccan origin , also attended the Brixton Mosque during the 1990s but was expelled for his extreme views and his attempts to impose them on the younger , more easily influenced members .
Towards the end of 1998 , Reid ceased worshipping at the mosque and is thought to have moved to Pakistan .
He reportedly sent several letters written in Arabic to friends in London .
His mother , Lesley Hughes , who is separated from Reid 's father , also believed he was in Pakistan .
But mother and son eventually lost contact and in summer 2001 Ms Hughes telephoned Brixton Mosque seeking news .
About the same time , Reid is believed to have embarked on an extensive travel programme , which saw him visit seven countries including some of the world 's so - called " terror capitals " .
Gone missing
He is thought to have spent time in Egypt , Israel , Turkey , Pakistan , Belgium , the Netherlands , France and possibly Afghanistan .
Commentators have suggested he may have used some of these excursions to test the security arrangements on various airlines , before boarding American Airlines flight 63 from Paris to Miami on 22 December 2001 .
He was overpowered by passengers and crew on the flight after trying to set light to a fuse connected to the explosives .
It has also been reported that a computer allegedly used by al - Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan contained files with details of a " scouting " trip Reid is believed to have carried out to identify targets to attack .
The computer files describe an operative known as Brother Abdul Ra'uff who travelled to the same countries Reid is believed to have spent time in .
Like Reid , the operative travelled on a British passport and was closely questioned by Israeli security .
As a result of the files the United States Government laid new charges against Mr Reid , including attempted murder .
Fatal shark attacks worldwide dipped to their lowest levels in two decades in 2007 with the sole casualty involving a swimmer vacationing in the South Pacific , according to the latest statistics from the University of Florida .
Except for 1987 , when there were no fatalities , the last year a single human death occurred from a shark attack was in 1985 , said George Burgess , director of the International Shark Attack File housed at UF ’s Florida Museum of Natural History .
By comparison , there were four deaths each in 2005 and 2006 , and seven in 2004 .
“ It ’s quite spectacular that for the hundreds of millions of people worldwide spending hundreds of millions of hours in the water in activities that are often very provocative to sharks , such as surfing , there is only one incident resulting in a fatality , ” he said .
“ The danger of a shark attack stays in the forefront of our psyches because of it being drilled into our brain for the last 30 years by the popular media , movies , books and television , but in reality the chances of dying from one are infinitesimal . ”
Advances in medical treatment , greater attention to beach safety practices and increased public awareness about the danger of shark attacks are all likely reasons the fatality rate so far for the 21st century , at 7.6 percent , has been lower than the 12.3 percent recorded for the 1990s , Burgess said .
The number of shark attacks overall increased from 63 in 2006 to 71 in 2007 , continuing a gradual upswing during the past four years , he said .
“ One would expect there to be more shark attacks each year than the previous year simply because there are more people entering the water , ” he said .
“ For baby boomers and earlier generations , going to the beach was basically an exercise in working on your suntan where a swim often meant a quick dunking .
Today people are engaged in surfing , diving , boogie boarding and other aquatic activities that put them much closer to sharks . ”
Occasionally , the number of attacks may drop in a particular year because of changes in meteorological or oceanographic conditions that affect water temperature and salinity , such as the frequency of hurricanes and tropical storms , Burgess said .
But scientists do n’t put too much stock in these year - to - year fluctuations , preferring to look at long - term trends , he said .

Traditionally , about half of the world ’s attacks occur in United States mainland and Hawaiian waters , but the proportion was greater in 2007 , Burgess said .
Last year ’s total of 50 attacks returned to 2000 and 2001 levels of 53 and 50 , respectively , after dropping from 30 to 40 for each year between 2003 and 2006 , he said .
Elsewhere , there were 12 attacks in Australia , up from seven in 2006 and 10 in 2005 , but down slightly from the 13 attacks recorded in 2004 .
There were two attacks each last year in South Africa and New Caledonia , with single incidents reported in Fiji , Ecuador , Mexico and New Zealand .
There also was an upswing in attacks along the Florida coast , jumping from 23 in 2006 to 32 in 2007 .
There has been a gradual increase in human - shark skirmishes in the Sunshine State since they dropped from 37 in 2000 to an 11 - year - low of 12 in 2004 , he said .
Within Florida , Volusia County continued its dubious distinction as the world ’s shark bite capital with 17 incidents , its highest yearly total since 2002 , Burgess said .
Attractive waves off New Smyrna Beach on the central Atlantic coast are popular with surfers , he said .
Additional U.S. attacks were recorded in Hawaii – seven — marking a five - year - high , along with South Carolina , five ; California , three ; North Carolina , two ; and Texas , one .

Fifty - six percent of the 2007 victims were surfers and windsurfers ; followed by swimmers and waders , 38 percent ; and divers and snorkelers , 6 percent .
Last year ’s Sept. 30 fatal attack involved a 23 - year - old woman from France who was snorkeling off the Loyalty Islands archipelago in French New Caledonia and became separated from a friend , Burgess said .
She was a nurse who had just finished a hospital contract in Noumea and was taking a brief vacation before flying home , he said .
“ We advise not getting yourself isolated because there is safety in numbers , ” he said .
“ Sharks , like all predators , tend to go after solitary individuals , the weak and the infirm , and are less likely to attack people or fish in groups . ”
Last year had few spectacular attacks or heartwarming rescue stories , Burgess said .
“ It was mostly minor injuries , ” he said .
“ There were n’t too many made - for - movie moments . ”
The Mating Mind .
A prof at the University of New Mexico has an interesting suggestion : the evolution of the human brain was largely driven by finding better ways to appeal to the opposite sex .
Geoffrey Miller is a man with a theory that , if true , will change the way people think about themselves .
His idea is that the human brain is the anthropoid equivalent of the peacock ’s tail .
In other words , it is an organ designed to attract the opposite sex .
Of course , brains have many other functions , and the human brain shares those with the brains of other animals .
But Dr Miller , who works at the University of New Mexico , thinks that mental processes which are uniquely human , such as language and the ability to make complicated artefacts , evolved originally for sexual display …
In a paper he has just published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , in collaboration with Vladas Griskevicius of Arizona State University , Dr Miller [ studied ] two activities ‘ conspicuous consumption and altruism towards strangers ’ to see if these support the ‘ mating mind ’ hypothesis , as Dr Miller has dubbed his idea .
Their conclusion is that they do .
[ From The Economist – Blatant benevolence and conspicuous consumption . ]
In essence , they propose that altruism is a form of conspicuous consumption designed to enhance the reputation ( and sex appeal , in the broadest sense ) of the donor .
Even though spendthrift behavior and charitable actions seem to be entirely unlike each other , in fact they may be different forms of the same behavior .
The researchers tested their hypothesis by dividing subjects into two groups , and primed ( see Priming ) one with romantic ideas by having them write about their ideal date .
The other group wrote about the weather .
They then gave the subjects a fictional $ 5,000 to spend , and also asked them to allocate 60 hours of leisure time .
The results were just what the researchers hoped for .
In the romantically primed group , the men went wild with the Monopoly money .
Conversely , the women volunteered their lives away .
Those women continued , however , to be skinflints , and the men remained callously indifferent to those less fortunate than themselves .
Meanwhile , in the other group there was little inclination either to profligate spending or to good works .
Based on this result , it looks as though the sexes do , indeed , have different strategies for showing off .
Moreover , they do not waste their resources by behaving like that all the time .
Only when it counts sexually are men profligate and women helpful .
That result was confirmed by the second experiment which , instead of looking at the amount of spending and volunteering , looked at how conspicuous it was .
After all , there is little point in producing a costly signal if no one sees it .
As predicted , romantically primed men wanted to buy items that they could wear or drive , rather than things to be kept at home .
Their motive , therefore , was not mere acquisitiveness .
Similarly , romantically primed women volunteered for activities such as working in a shelter for the homeless , rather than spending an afternoon alone picking up rubbish in a park .
For both sexes , however , those in an unromantic mood were indifferent to the public visibility of their choices .
These two studies support the idea , familiar from everyday life , that what women want in a partner is material support while men require self - sacrifice .
There ’s useful information in this work for all kinds of marketers , both for - profit and nonprofit .
Some of the conclusions may be fairly obvious .
Long before neuromarketing and evolutionary psychology , marketers knew that men spend money to enhance their reputation ( and their appeal to the opposite sex ) – expensive sports cars , costly restaurants , and so on all demonstrate that the guy is financially well - fixed and hence attractive .
Marketers who give a man a chance to buy something expensive in a visible way can expect an above - average rate of success .
Nonprofits looking for donations must , to appeal to males , also ensure visibility – public recognition is particularly important among those who , even unconsciously , are seeking to boost their attractiveness .
The female side of the equation is a bit different .
Women , apparently , tend not to spend money conspicuously as an implicit mating strategy .
Interestingly , they may be induced to spend their time conspicuously for that purpose .
Nonprofits looking for volunteers know that recognition is important , and this research underscores that some recognition should be public and visible to be most effective .
As always , there are a few caveats .
These behaviors were most apparent when the subjects had been primed romantically – it would be a mistake to generalize these behaviors to all males and all females in every circumstance .
It would n’t surprise me if there are age - based differences not uncovered in this research .
And this work is bound to be controversial simply because it implies a selfish biological basis for altruistic behavior .
When you suggest that both the male executive who writes a hefty check for cancer research or the Junior League member who spends hundreds of hours on fundraising for a new hospital wing are both being driven by a biological imperative , you are bound to catch some flak .
On Sunday 's " Late Edition " Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) amid the flurry of RNC talking points , tells an outright lie , saying that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) called the troops " losers . "
As you 'll see from the video , Rep. Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) wastes no time putting Graham in his place .

BOXER : I do n't know anyone who opposes this war that ever said our troops are losers .
Our troopers are winners .
GRAHAM : Harry Reid did .
BOXER : Excuse me .
He never said our troops are losers .
Now , Lindsey , just be careful what you say .
The bottom line here is , the losers are the ones who have , you know , engineered this war , made a huge mistake , Dick Cheney , we 're in the last throes , the war will last six months , and all of you who have supported this escalation and have turned us away from fighting al Qaida into putting us in the middle of a civil war .

BLITZER : All right .
So , what do you say to that fear that if you get your way , Iraq 's going to become a base for al Qaida to start attacking Americans around the world ?
BOXER : If I get my way , my way is the way of the American people .
They say we have sacrificed blood , we have sacrificed hundreds of billions of dollars , and what do we have to show for it ?
We went in there because we wanted to get the weapons of mass destruction .
Remember that ?
We found there were none .
OK .
Well , the president said , as long as we 're there , let 's get Saddam .
Our troops were brilliant .
They got Saddam .
After we got Saddam , a lot of us thought , OK , time to let the Iraqis now deal with their own country .
Oh , no .
We had to get the sons .
We had to get the relatives and show their bodies to show we meant business .
OK .
A lot of us thought that was time .
Then we had to make sure there were elections .
Our troops were magnificent .
Three elections .
And now there 's no end in sight .
And the fearmongering that goes on , if we do n't fight them there , we 'll fight them here .
I have news for everybody .
We are in a war against terrorism here .
There are al Qaida cells here .
And yes , there 's al Qaida in Iraq , and that 's why Russ Feingold , Harry Reid , Chris Dodd , myself , many of us say we need to stay in the region and fight al Qaida and finally get bin Laden .
So the status quo is making us weak .
It 's taking our eye off the war against terror .
And that 's my way .
My way is the way of the American people .
Wars have end , Wolf .
They have end .
Unless you 're a permanent occupier , and we 've never seen so .
BLITZER : And the polls do back her up , Senator Graham .
The American public wants the U.S. to set a timetable to get out of Iraq .
GRAHAM : Well , the people in South Carolina want me to use my best judgment , and I 'm up for election in 2008 .
And if I 'm not using the judgment that the people of South Carolina believe makes sense , then I 'll lose my job .
I 'm very much willing to lose my job to make sure we do n't lose this battle in Iraq , which is part of a global struggle against terrorism .
Al Qaida 's there for a reason .
But if the Shia extremists win the day and align with Iran , we 're going you have a bigger war .
If the Sunni extremists topple this government and there 's an all - out civil war , the Sunni Arab states are not going to sit on the sidelines and watch their brothers -- Sunni brothers and sisters get killed or slaughtered .
If the Kurdish north breaks away from Iraq , the Turks are not going to sit on the sidelines .
So , the consequences of a failed state for the region , for the world , and our national security interests are huge and great .
And the surge is in its infant stages .
Everyone 's not on the ground yet .
It 's our last best chance .
Let 's do n't undercut it .
Let 's do n't declare this war lost , because you 're telling Petraeus and all these soldiers that Barbara just talked about they 're losers .
They have not had the opportunity ...
BOXER : Oh , I 've just got to straighten out the record on this .
GRAHAM : ... to implement this strategy .
BLITZER : All right .
GRAHAM : And if I may finish my thought , if I may finish my thought , those who , no matter how well - intentioned , are calling for our withdrawal , deadlines and timelines that inform the enemy about how to beat us , are in fact the authors of a greater war .
The Bush administration screwed this up early on by not having enough troops .
I support the surge .
I 'll take the consequences of its failure .
Give it a chance .
But if it all fails we 're going to have a bigger war .
BLITZER : Let me let Senator Boxer respond .
BOXER : I do n't know anyone who opposes this war that ever said our troops are losers .
Our troopers are winners .
GRAHAM : Harry Reid did .
BOXER : Excuse me .
He never said our troops are losers .
Now , Lindsey , just be careful what you say .
The bottom line here is , the losers are the ones who have , you know , engineered this war , made a huge mistake , Dick Cheney , we 're in the last throes , the war will last six months , and all of you who have supported this escalation and have turned us away from fighting al Qaida into putting us in the middle of a civil war .
Now , the fact is I want to be very clear on this , Wolf .
I 've lost in California 21 percent of the dead troops .
You understand that ?
Twenty - one percent either were born in California or were stationed in California .
I have their names listed in the front of my office .
If you come and see my office , they are all on these charts .
And you know what , Lindsey ?
I have to keep making the print on the charts smaller and smaller to fit all the names on four full charts .
BLITZER : Senator ?
BOXER : So do n't say anyone calls them losers .
They 're winners .
The loser is the commander in chief who has not led our country well
Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich caused a stink on the House of Representatives floor this morning during a speech where he announced he 'll introduce articles of impeachment against President Bush on Monday , Jan. 28 , the day Bush delivers his State of the Union speech .
" We already know the State of the Union , " Kucinich says in his speech .
" It 's a lie .
" Republicans objected to Kucinich 's statements , and the Cleveland congressman returned to the floor a few minutes later to withdraw his " offending words . "
Florida GOP Rep. Cliff Stearns called Kucinich 's statements a " clear and egregious violation of House rules " but said he 'd accept Kucinich 's request to withdraw his remarks .
" Both sides here attempt to restore civility , calmness here with legitimate debate and not utter personal accusations , " Stearns said .
UPDATE : In a statement issued to The Plain Dealer this afternoon , Stearns explained his objections to Kucinich 's remarks :
" This morning , Rep. Kucinich used the House floor to launch a personal attack against President Bush and Vice President Cheney and accused them of lying to the American people .
He also said that the House was ' living a lie . '
His outburst was a violation of House rules and I asked that his remarks be taken down and the Speaker upheld my objection .
Kucinich withdrew his remarks rather than have his words struck down , which would have forced him to leave the House floor for the day .
After he decided to withdraw his remarks , I stated that I would not object " ' with the understanding that these egregious accusations are in violation of the House rules and his statements must stop for the civility of the House and
debate . ' "
Circumcision Opponents Use the Legal System and Legislatures
New York Times , January 23 , 2003

FARGO , N.D. , Jan. 16 � Josiah Flatt , like about 60 percent of other newborn American boys , was circumcised soon after he was born here , in the spring of 1997 .
Two years later , his parents sued the doctor and the hospital .
They did not contend that the circumcision was botched or deny that Josiah 's mother , Anita Flatt , had consented to the procedure in writing .
They said , instead , that the doctor had failed to tell them enough about the pain , complications and consequences of circumcision , removing the foreskin of the penis .
The suit will be heard by a jury next month .
In declining to dismiss the case here before trial , Judge Cynthia Rothe - Seeger acknowledged that the case was unusual in that nothing " went `wrong ' during the procedure . "
The main harm Josiah seeks compensation for , Judge Rothe - Seeger noted , is " diminished sexual sensation injury . "
The suit is but one effort by a small but energetic group of loosely affiliated advocates and lawyers to use the legal system to combat the practice � most American newborn boys undergo the operation when they are days old � which they liken to genital cutting in girls .
The advocates have been active in state legislatures , too .
Ten states no longer allow Medicaid to pay for circumcision .
" They have reached the ears of legislators and insurance companies , " Dr. Thomas Wiswell , a professor of pediatrics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and a proponent of the procedure , said about the opponents .
" They are far more vocal than proponents of circumcision . "
J. Steven Svoboda , director of Attorneys for the Rights of the Child , a group devoted to the issue , contends that circumcision is wrong as a matter of law , medicine and philosophy .
Children of both sexes , Mr. Svoboda said , should be entitled to " bodily integrity . "
Josiah Flatt 's case appears to be the first to go to trial based on the theory that the absence of an exhaustive medical briefing about the risks and benefits of circumcision is tantamount to a lack of informed consent .
Among the possible complications in the operation are excess bleeding , infection and ulceration and occasional permanent damage to the penis .
" This could be a very important test case , " said Geoffrey P. Miller , a professor of law at New York University who has written about legal and cultural issues of circumcision .
Josiah 's father , James , died in 2001 in an automobile accident , but the boy 's mother , Anita , 33 , decided to proceed with the suit .
The family 's lawyer , Zenas Baer , said no sensible parent would willingly subject a child to circumcision knowing what it entailed .
" The practice is absolutely barbaric , " Mr. Baer said .
The doctor who performed the circumcision , Sunita Kantak , and representatives of the hospital , the MeritCare Medical Center , issued this statement : " Anita Flatt was given information about circumcision , and she asked to have her son circumcised .
The circumcision was done because she requested it . "
A hospital spokeswoman , Carrie Johnson , declined to elaborate .
In court papers , the hospital said the suit was part of a crusade .
" This lawsuit is an attempt to abolish circumcision in North Dakota of newborn males with healthy foreskin , " the hospital 's lawyers wrote .
" Plaintiffs want to change public policy so that only a competent male once he reaches adulthood , and not his parent , should be able to consent to circumcision . "
Only 3 in 1,000 men not circumcised at birth choose to have the procedure , experts say .
David J. Llewellyn , a Georgia lawyer who represents plaintiffs in circumcision malpractice cases , said the hospital was correct in identifying what would be the next step for opponents of the practice .
" The question of whether or not a parent can consent at all will come rather quickly , " Mr. Llewellyn said .
Judge Rothe - Seeger , who will preside over the trial in Cass County District Court , seemed to agree in a pretrial decision .
She suggested that Josiah could sue his parents some day if he could show that they failed to act in his best interests .
About 1.2 million newborns are circumcised in the United States every year , at a cost of $ 150 million to $ 270 million , the American Academy of Pediatrics says .
Circumcision for other than religious reasons is a relatively recent phenomenon in the United States .
It began in the late 19th century and peaked in the 1960 's at 90 percent of newborns .
Circumcision rates vary widely .
They are highest in the Midwest , about 80 percent , and lowest in the West , under 40 percent .
The procedure is not common elsewhere .
In Canada , the rate is 17 percent and in Britain 5 percent .
Elsewhere in Europe , in South America and in non-Muslim Asia , the procedure is rare .
There is powerful evidence , Dr. Wiswell said , that circumcision helps prevent urinary tract infections , penile cancer and sexually transmitted diseases , including H.I.V .
The American Academy of Pediatrics , in a policy statement in 1999 , said that the risks of infection and cancer were low even without the procedure and that evidence on sexually transmitted diseases was " complex and conflicting . "
The academy noted that the procedure could involve complications , as could any surgery .
If performed without adequate anesthesia , it is very painful .
The academy concluded that " existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision . "
" However , " it added , " these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision . "
It added that it was " legitimate for parents to take into account cultural , religious and ethnic traditions , in addition to the medical factors , when making this decision . "
Judge Rothe - Seeger wrote , " One of the earliest purposes of circumcision was to limit sexual intercourse and to curb sexual excitement . "
It has also been prescribed through the years as a remedy for alcoholism , epilepsy , asthma , gout , hysteria , malnutrition , night terrors , clubfoot , eczema and promiscuity . "
Circumcision is a medical procedure in search of something to cure , " said Mr. Baer , the Flatts ' lawyer .
In the last year , Arizona , Missouri , Montana and North Carolina joined six other states � California , Mississippi , Nevada , North Dakota , Oregon and Washington � that do not offer Medicaid reimbursement for circumcision for any reason , including religious beliefs .
David L. Gollaher , who wrote " Circumcision : A History of the World 's Most Controversial Surgery " ( Basic Books , 2000 ) , said that trend would " be the bullet that kills this thing . "
" If people have to pony up a couple of hundred bucks , at the margin , they wo n't do it , " Mr. Gollaher said .
" And insurance coverage signals a certain attitude about medical appropriateness or necessity . "
There is little legal scholarship in the area .
That is partly attributable , Professor Miller said , to efforts intended to prevent genital cutting in girls , a practice prevalent in Africa that reduces sexual pleasure .
" It 's all tied up in the politics of feminism , " he said .
" Some feminists take offense at the idea that there is any comparison between a highly damaging assault committed by a patriarchal society and male circumcision .
It 's a dangerous topic to get into . "
In an interview , Ms. Flatt , who is a lawyer , said she was told next to nothing about circumcision before she consented to it .
Asked what she wished she had been told , she grew animated and her voice rose .
" It 's healthy tissue , " she said of the foreskin .
" It 's useful .
There 's bleeding risk .
There 's pain .
There 's infection risk .
There 's death risk .
There 's no medical benefit . "
You 'd better give me a very good reason why , and it 's got to be more than he 'll look like dad . "

Via Lawyers , Guns , and Money , Chris Muir takes a stab at intellectual history :
and the next day :
Apparently , ' later ' in this last one used to read ' Locke ' , but someone clued Muir in to the fact that Locke was , in fact , Christian , and based his theory of property on our duties to God .
But that , of course , is n't the real howler , nor is the bizarre idea that this country was in any serious way " based on " Kant , let alone Schopenhauer , who was just one year old when the Constitution was adopted .
What actually makes my head explode is this :
Yeeeaaarghh !!!
The usual complaint about Kant is that he was too inflexible .
( He thought , for instance , that if a murderer comes to the door and asks where to find the person he wants to kill , it 's wrong to lie . )
To call him a nihilist , or a relativist , or someone who does n't believe in objective truth , is like -- well , one of LG& M 's analogies is " command economy Hayekianism " .
Since truth is one but error is infinite , there 's no shortage of further subjects for Chris Muir 's strips : Leninist anarchism , Kierkegaardian rationalism , Thomist atheism , Nazi Judaism , cautious and sober Maoism , Britney Spearsian profundity , Caligulan propriety and decency , Robespierrian restraint , Mozartian lugubriousness , and of course Muirian thoughtful , well - informed commentary .
Commenters at LG&M googled the phrase ' Kantian nihilism , and found that most of the pages using it had gotten it from Ayn Rand .
See , for instance , here :
" Among noted thinkers of the day , Ayn Rand alone stood firm against the tide of Kantian nihilism and in support of reason , individualism , and laissez - faire capitalism - the philosophic ideals that are the foundation of American achievement and progress .
Three decades later , despite a seemingly different sociopolitical climate , the intellectual essence of the " New Left " endures .
Its continued influence - manifested in such ideologies as environmentalism and multiculturalism - renders Rand 's observations and warnings as relevant , and as urgently needed , as when they were first written . "
And here :
