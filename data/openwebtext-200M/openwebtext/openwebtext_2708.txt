The Conference Finals :
The four trades that got us here
We ’re down to four teams … Cavs / Magic … Lakers / Nuggets …
What do they have in common ?
Star power , efficient offense , pretty solid defense , good coaching … check , check , check and check .
But how about an aggressive front office ?
Each of these four teams made a major trade in the last two years .
July 11 , 2007 : The Magic sign Rashard Lewis
This was a sign - and - trade , not a straight free agent signing , but the Magic only had to give up a conditional second round pick .
The upside for the then - Seattle Supersonics was a trade exception worth $ 9 million .
The contract ( six years , $ 110 million ) seemed outlandish at the time , and Lewis is still overpaid , but the Magic did what they had to do to get him .
He ’s a great fit for what Orlando is trying to do .
They are built like the Rockets were in the Hakeem Olajuwon era — find a big man who commands a double - team , and surround him with great shooters .
Lewis is the Magic ’s version of Robert Horry in that he ’s a lanky , versatile , sharpshooting big man .
Strength - wise , he ’s not built like a typical power forward , but since the NBA has gotten smaller and quicker over the past few years , he can get by against most teams .
Offensively , he creates all sorts of problems for opposing power forwards as he can drill the long ball ( career 39 % from 3 PT ) or take it to the rack .
He ’s also pretty good in the post when teams try to defend him with a smaller player .
Sure , the Magic overpaid on that contract , but I think it ’s safe to say that if they had n’t , they would n’t be in the Eastern Conference Finals right now .
Lewis is a big , big part of Orlando ’s recent success .
GM
Otis Smith deserves a lot of credit for having the cojones to pull the trigger on this deal .
February 1 , 2008 : The Lakers trade for Pau Gasol
Also known as “ the trade heard ’ round the world , ” this was the date when the Lakers went from being a Western Conference also - ran to one of the elite teams in the NBA .
For Gasol , the Lakers traded Kwame Brown ’s expiring contract , point guard Javaris Crittenton ( now with Washington , I think ) , Aaron McKie ( to balance the trade out financially ) , two first round picks and the rights to second round pick ( and Pau ’s brother ) , Marc Gasol .
Memphis used one of those first round picks to acquire Darrell Arthur , who had a decent if unspectacular rookie season .
Marc
Gasol turned out to be a pretty good center , though time will tell if he ’s really a starter - caliber big man on a playoff team .
No matter what Memphis GM Chris Wallace said at the time , this was a straight salary dump for the Grizzlies .
For the Lakers , Gasol gave Kobe a high - IQ sidekick at the PF/C position .
He picked up the triangle offense quickly ( which is no easy feat ) and seemed revitalized by the trade .
His scoring and rebounding has remained unchanged , but his FG % took a big jump in the right direction .
The Lakers essentially added an All - Star caliber player without losing any of their top eight or nine players .
The only knock on Gasol is that he plays soft at times , and that came back to bite the Lakers in the Finals last year .
For Laker GM Mitch Kupchak , the trade represented redemption .
He ( justifiably ) took a lot of flack over trading away Caron Butler for Kwame Brown three years earlier , and it was sweet justice that it was Brown ’s expiring contract that was the key cog in Wallace ’s desire to cut salary .
August 13 , 2008 : The Cavs acquire Mo Williams
As a Bucks fan , I thought Milwaukee got fleeced in this deal , but given the reports that Williams and All - Star guard Michael Redd simply could not get along , I guess it ’s understandable .
There were also some salary cap benefits for the Bucks , and without Williams there , Ramon Sessions has had a chance to emerge as a future star at point guard .
( Now , if only the Bucks can hold onto him .
Sigh . )
For the Cavs , this seems to be the move that put the team over the top , talent - wise .
They gave up Damon Jones ( big deal ) and Joe Smith ( who later returned ) , so like the Lakers did with Pau Gasol , they added an All - Star talent for basically nothing .
And just like the Lakers , this has more to do with having an owner that ’s willing to spend than it is with any great strategy or tactics in the front office .
But I give GM Danny Ferry credit —
Williams turned out to be a very nice fit .
He had no problem deferring to LeBron ( but who would , really ) and is given the offensive reins when James hits the bench .
He averaged 17.8 points and 4.1 assists this season , but the improvement in his offensive efficiency is the bigger deal .
He shot almost 47 % from the field and almost 44 % from long range , which means his defender can’t spend any time in the lane digging at LeBron ’s drives without paying a serious price .
It ’s funny that the Cavs were thisclose to adding Redd a few seasons ago and it was the lefty ’s relationship with Williams that drove him out of town .
The Cavs got their guy in the end .
November 3 , 2008 : The Nuggets acquire Chauncey Billups
At the time , this trade was considered by many ( but not me , I ’m happy to say ) to be pretty even from a talent standpoint , but it turned out great for the Nuggets and not - so - great for the Pistons .
Nuggets GM Mark Warkentien saw that the Allen Iverson / Carmelo Anthony experiment was n’t working , so he used AI ’s monster expiring salary to wrestle one of the best point guards in the league away from the Pistons .
Much has been written about what Billups has meant to the Nuggets this season , but I think it ’s safe to say that his leadership and commitment to defense are the two biggest factors in Denver ’s rise .
He ’s not threatened by ‘ Melo ( and vice versa ) , and the two are able to co-exist in a way that the Iverson / Anthony combination simply could n’t .
Along with the emergence of a finally healthy Nene , the Nuggets truly are the second - best team in the West ( at least ) .
For the Pistons , this move backfired .
GM
Joe Dumars was trying to clear cap space for this summer ( and next ) , while still keeping the Pistons competitive .
Iverson did n’t fit in well , and was a bad match for the personnel already on the roster .
By trading away Billups , Dumars essentially gave up any hope of a deep run this postseason .
We ’ll see how he ’s able to rebuild now that he has all of this cap space .

CAIRO  Just as President Obama arrived in the Middle East , the television channel Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape on Wednesday that it said was from Osama bin Laden , accusing Mr. Obama of planting new seeds of “ hatred and vengeance toward Americans . ”
The message focused on Mr. Obama ’s decision to step up pressure on extremists in Pakistan .
The speaker specifically blamed the president for the Pakistani military ’s drive to retake an area in the Swat Valley that had recently come under the control of Taliban forces .
The speaker also blamed Mr. Obama for the “ one million Muslims ” who had to flee their homes because of the fighting .
United Nations and Pakistani officials estimate that as many as three million people have been displaced by the conflict .
“ Obama has followed the footsteps of his predecessor in increasing animosity toward Muslims and increasing enemy fighters and establishing long - term wars , ” the recording said .
“ So the American people should get ready to reap the fruits of what the leaders of the White House have planted throughout the coming years and decades . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators may be tempted to force bank marriages and asset sales to fill multi-billion dollar capital holes exposed by their stress tests .

But a rapid redrawing of the banking landscape like the one last fall may not be in the cards , banking industry experts say , even though the capital shortfalls at the 19 largest U.S. banks are much larger than analysts had expected .
Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz wrote that banks , other than his own , may need to raise $ 75 billion after the tests .
The results are due on Thursday , and about 10 of the 19 banks may need capital , according to media leaks .
While seeking stronger partners could be tempting to the weaker banks , their healthier brethren will likely want to repay money they got under the Treasury Department ’s $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) before they use their capital for acquisitions .
And regulators may not have the needed leverage to force these banks to buy their needy rivals , the experts said .
Still as some banks find it hard to raise money , and with mergers often offering significant cost savings , regulators may try to forge a handful of deals , they said .
Some companies may try to sell assets to raise capital , but regulators are unlikely to give weaker banks six months to raise capital unless they have assets they can plausibly sell in that time , said Seamus McMahon , chief executive of bank consulting firm McMahon Advisory LLC .
“ If what you are saying is that you are waiting for market conditions to improve and you have no plausible plans in place by June , I do n’t think they will hesitate to force some of these banks together , ” McMahon said .
The list of likely acquirers could include banks such as US Bancorp USB.N , JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N , McMahon said .
Targets could include banks such as SunTrust Banks Inc STI.N , Regions Financial Corp RF.N , KeyCorp KEY.N and Fifth Third Bancorp FITB.O , he added .
Citigroup Inc C.N , which a source said needs $ 5 billion , could be an acquirer as well despite all its troubles , as takeovers could be a way for it to get much - needed deposits , McMahon said .
RELUCTANT BUYERS ?
In urging any mergers , though , regulators will want to be careful that they do not create a new problem instead of solving one .
“ You do n’t want to put two stones together and see if they float , ” said Jonathan Weld , a banking lawyer at Shearman & Sterling .
“ You would only want to put together a strong organization and a weaker one if you thought that you could restructure it and emerge with a strong single entity . ”
The regulators will be dealing with a situation much changed from last fall , when the U.S. financial system was at a risk of collapse and the government bailout money was seen by many as desirable .
Now , healthy banks are eager to give back taxpayer funds and , despite a recession , the end of the financial world does n’t appear to be at hand .
“ The reality is they too want to get rid of their TARP money , ” said Marshall Sonenshine , chairman of the boutique investment bank bearing his name , referring to healthier institutions .
“ So they are not going to buy anything that slows down that process . ”
Regulators may have also lost some of their leeway after allegations they forced Bank of America BAC.N to complete its acquisition of Merrill Lynch .
“ Already you have BofA feeling more than a little bit burned by having been pushed so hard to take over Merrill Lynch , ” Sonenshine said .
“ You are likely to see more banks fail at the bottom of the food chain . ”
Regulators may not want to create another giant through a merger , but they could urge one of the stronger banks to acquire a weak and smaller rival .
“ If as a result of the stress test they realize there are two categories of banks -- banks with excess capital that are in great shape and banks that are deficient , then such marriages may make a lot of sense from a regulatory standpoint , ” said Joseph Vitale , a bank regulatory partner at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel .
The recent disclosure of 46 new security fixes in iPhone 3.0 is just part of the proof the iPhone is ready for Enterprise adoption .
For years Blackberry has set the standard for Enterprise class Smartphone security features .
This has endeared it to businesses the world over and made Blackberry the undisputed leader in the Enterprise Smartphone sector .
The release of the iPhone 3G did little to challenge Blackberry 's Enterprise dominance .
With its latest hardware and software iPhone upgrade Apple takes another shot across the bow of Blackberry .
Will this shot be more than just a warning shot this time ?
Should Blackberry be wary of the new iPhone 3GS and 3.0 software ?
Will the new iPhone 3GS measure up to the high security standards that Enterprises have come to expect in their corporate Smart phones ?
Only time will tell for sure , but it looks promising for Apple .
First let 's start by reviewing the considerable number of security fixes that Apple put into iPhone 3.0 software .
A total of 46 security fixes were introduced in iPhone 3.0 code .
Of the 46 security holes fixed , 12 are listed by Apple as " may lead to arbitrary code execution " .
Contrary to what your first reaction to this news might be , this is actually excellent news !
No other Smartphone company has publicly demonstrated such a comprehensive dedication to secure coding practices and reviews .
All code will inevitably be found to have vulnerabilities ; after all it is humans who are programming it .
What truly makes one company stand out from another is their commitment to adopting a secure coding methodology and code review process .
Given the shear breadth of Apple 's iPhone 3.0 security fixes it is evident that the Apple iPhone coding team has adopted these best practices .
This should be a big differentiator to any business evaluating the differences in security between different Smartphone manufacturers .
Add to this the fact that the iPhone OS is largely based on the MAC OS X platform , the iPhone also inherits much of the respectable security track record that OS X has enjoyed over the years .
Now let 's take a look at the baseline security features that the iPhone adopted with the 2.x code train .
Apple added a Cisco IPSEC VPN client , WPA2 802.1 x wireless support , two - factor authentication with token / OTP or PKI Certificate support , wirelessly push company email , calendar events , and contacts over a 128 - bit encrypted SSL connection , and iPhone Security Configuration Profiles to set and enforce the above corporate security policies .
One security feature almost nobody seems to know exists in 2.x , and miss reports as a limitation of the iPhone security all the time , is Alphanumeric pass codes of 4 or more characters with special character enforcement included .
You must use an iPhone profile in order to enable it , look here for more info on creating a profile .
Here is a screenshot of how it looks when enabled :
With the release of iPhone 3.0 software Apple has added a few important new security features to the iPhone .
Tops on the list is hardware data encryption , available only on the new iPhone 3GS .
Just like it says , this feature will encrypt all of your data on the device .
Exactly how this works I do n't know yet .
But I am downloading the 3.0 SDK so should have an update soon .
The second most important is the remote wipe capability .
This allows a user with a lost / stolen iPhone to send a command to their phone over the airwaves telling it to delete itself and restore factory default settings .
The way the remote wipe functions differs based on the iPhone model you have .
If you have the iPhone 3G then the 3.0 software performs a bit by bit secure delete of the drive and then restores the factory defaults .
If you have a new iPhone 3GS then the remote wipe will just delete the hardware encryption key , thus rendering the data unreadable , and then restore factory default settings .
The advantage of the iPhone 3GS method is that it allows for a user to restore their data later if they end up finding their iPhone .
The 3.0 software will just restore the deleted hardware encryption key thus allowing you to read the data once more .
The draw back of this method is that if the crypto key is stored locally on the device how securely is it stored .
Could a hacker steal your phone , prevent a remote wipe by RF shielding the phone , and then be able to find and use the local key to get at the data ?
This is theoretical of course , nobody seems to know how this key is protected yet .
Another great new feature is the " Find my iPhone " feature .
It allows a user with a mobileMe account to logon and see where their iPhone is currently located on the planet .
In addition to being a convenience feature for the user it is also a security feature that could allow law enforcement to track and capture a thief that has stolen a highly sensitive iPhone (s ) .
So what is the iPhone still missing to be Enterprise ready ?
Some say it is ready to go now .
However , not everyone agrees ( as is usual ) .
They point out that the iPhone needs a to offer Enterprises more control over the devices themselves for software upgrades , auditing , enforcement , tracking , remote wipe functions , monitoring , troubleshooting , etc .
The leader in this space is Blackberry 's Enterprise Server solution .
Without a doubt this would be a venerable addition to the iPhone 's feature list , but I 'd argue that for all but the largest enterprises this is not a showstopper .
Given the superiority of the iPhone interface vs. other Smartphone devices , if Apple does have this in development then we might see a enterprise Smartphone monopoly coming .
What features do you think the iPhone still needs for mass adoption in the Enterprise market ?
Do you think the latest release is enough ?
The opinions and information presented here are my PERSONAL views and not those of my employer .
I am in no way an official spokesperson for my employer .
Community One Westレポート
サンのクラウドは 、Amazon EC2とどう違うのか？
サン・マイクロシステムズが2009年夏にも提供を開始するクラウドサービス「Sun Cloud」の概要が見えてきた。同社のクラウドサービスはOpenSolarisベースの仮想環境で、Amazon EC2/S3に相当するサービスを提供するものだ。計算リソース（OSやアプリケーションなどのソフトウェア実行環境）を提供する「 Sun Cloud Compute Service」とストレージサービスの「 Sun Cloud Storage Service 」で構成する。
価格などまだ不明な点は多いが、技術情報は徐々に出てきている。例えばストレージサービスに関してはWebDAVやAmazon
S3互換のRESTful APIでアクセスできることが明らかにされているほか、APIのドキュメントやJavaで書かれた管理コンソール、PythonやRuby向けのライブラリが公開されている。スクリプトやAPI経由でボリュームの作成・削除、スナップショットの作成などができる。
Javaで書かれた管理コンソール。クラウド上のボリュームの作成などストレージの管理ができるようだ。このほか、まだバージョンは0.2だが、Ruby、Pythonなどのスクリプトで管理できるようにライブラリも準備されている
ベータ版の期間も含めると先行するAmazonに遅れること3年。Sun Cloudは、後発として、価格、使い勝手、サービスの種類などで、どこまで差別化できるだろうか。2009年6月1日から3日間の予定で米国サンフランシスコで開催したイベント「CommunityOne West」の基調講演の内容から、サンのクラウドが目指す方向性を探ってみたい。
基調講演でクラウドについて語るサン・マイクロシステムズのシニア・バイス・プレジデント、デイブ・ダグラス氏（Dave Douglas、左）と、クラウドコンピューティングの技術責任者を務めるルー・タッカー（Lew Tucker、右）氏
20年前のグリッドをもう1度、サンにはお手の物!?
「 CommunityOne West」はサンが主催する年次イベン ト 「 JavaOne」と併催される開発者向けイベントだ。JavaOneがサンの製品にフォーカスしているのに対して、CommunityOneは文字通り、コミュニティやオープンソースにフォーカスしている。
CommunityOne初日に基調講演を行ったのは、サン・マイクロシステムズのシニア・バイス・プレジデント、デイブ・ダグラス氏（Dave Douglas）。現在ダグラス氏は、サンでクラウンドコンピューティング関連のプロジェクトを担当している。言うまでもなく、クラウドは同社が取り組んでいる分野の中でも、特に強力に推進している分野だ。
Sun Cloudのデモンストレーションを行うに当たり、ステージ上のダグラス氏に加わったのは、同社でクラウドコンピューティングの技術責任者を務めるルー・タッカー氏だ。タッカー氏はCloud CTOという今風のとってつけたような肩書きを持っているが、彼にしてみれば時代が一巡したような感覚があるのかもしれない。「われわれ2人は今から20年前に、世界最速のコンピュータの前に座っていたよね。またやることになったわけだ」（タッカー氏）。サンは、HPCやグリッドコンピューティング分野への取り組みは長いので、「グリッド」の装いが変わっただけのクラウドもお手の物だと言いたげだ。
各種サーバもスイッチもドラッグ＆ドロップ
デモンストレーションはGUIを使ったユーザーインターフェイスが特に印象的だった。Webブラウザベースのネットワーク管理ツールを使い、サーバやスイッチをフリースペースに並べて矢印でつなぐだけ。それでシステムが構成できるというのだ。実際、左側ペインに用意された「Ubuntuサーバ」「OpenSolarisサーバ 」 「 Fedoraサーバ」などをドラッグ＆ドロップする。インスタンスイメージは、単にOS別というだけでなく、Webサーバやファイアウォール、DBサーバ「MySQL」、分散キャッシュメモリ「memcached」、分散処理フレームワークの「Hadoop」、ロードバランサやリバースプロキシとして機能する「Squid」などを使うことができる。
Webブラウザベース のGUI で、ドラッグ＆ドロップによるサーバやスイッチの構成管理が可能
Hadoopクラスタでインスタンスを追加することもできる
デモンストレーションでは、インターフェイスを見せただけなので、どこまでこうした抽象化でシステムコンフィギュレーションが自動化できるかはまだ分からない。もし、「memcachedを3台追加」というような直感的なディプロイができるようになるのだとすれば、企業ユーザーにとっては革新的なサービスになりそうだ。サンでは一旦構築したシステムは同様のUIを通じて監視や管理、再構成が可能なほか、システム全体をモデル化して保存し、それを再び適用するといった使い方が可能になるとしている。
Amazon EC2 で もWebブラウザベースの管理コンソール上から、OSインスタンスやストレージに対して基本的な操作が可能だ。しかし、複数のサーバを有機的に構成するのはHadoopフレームワークなど一部を除いてユーザーの手に委ねられている。Sun Cloudがもし本当に画面から期待される通りに動くのであれば（それはデモンストレーションだけでは分からないが）、各種サーバや、ネットワークアプライアンスに相当する「OSインスタンス＋サーバアプリケーション」など複数のノードを2次元の画面でつなぐことでITシステムを構築、運用ができる、一歩進んだクラウド環境になると言えそうだ。
サンは6月2日にクラウド上でのシステム構築のコンサルティングを行うサービス「 Cloud Strategic Planning Service」を提供していくと発表している。基調講演での言及は最小限で、発表資料も短い。まだ内容はほとんど不明といっていいレベルだ。ただ、サンがクラウドビジネスにおいて、単にコンピューティングやストレージのリソースを提供することだけを考えているわけではない、ということは間違いないだろう。
エコシステムは立ち上がるか？
サンは、2009年3 月にSun CloudのAPIをオープンにしていくと発表しているが、こうしたAPIを利用したサードパーティー製ツール、サービスがどこまで充実するかも注目だ。Amazon EC2の成功した要因の1つは、多くのスタートアップを含むIT企業が、Amazon EC2に対して（あるいはAmazon EC2上で）、さまざまなサービスを提供したことでエコシステムができたことにある。
CommunityOneの基調講演では、パートナーの取り組みに関しても紹介があった。ステージ上に登場したのはクラウド向けのデータベース「Vertica」、クラウド上のアプリケーションサーバの監視や自動スケーリングを行う「webappVM」、オンプレミスサーバからクラウドへアーカイブを保存したり、災害復帰を行う「Moonwalk」の3製品の担当者。
これらの企業は、いずれ もAmazon EC2/S3に対してサービスを提供しており、Sun Cloudへの対応は自然な流れとも言える。サンが主張するようにクラウド関連のAPIが、今後どこまで標準化されるのかは未知数だが、同目的のAPIが存在するのであれば、たとえAPIの仕様が違っても、こうしたサービスをAmazon EC2 、Sun Cloud の両対応とするのは難しくないだろう。基調講演終了後の展示会場でwebappVMの担当者に聞いたところ、Sun Cloudへの対応自体は難しくないが、まだサンの準備が終わるにはもう少し時間がかかるだろうという回答だった。

OpenSolaris 2009.06がリリース、クラウドにもインパクト
Amazon EC2 とSun Cloudには大きな違いがある。それはAmazon EC2がサービスのみであるのに対して、Sun Cloudはプラットフォーム自体もオープンソースで提供するとしていることだ。つまり、サン以外がSun Cloudと同様のクラウドサービスを始めてもいいし、企業ユーザーがデータセンターのサーバリソースを有効活用するために、手持ちの資産をプライベートクラウド化する目的でも使えるということだ。
もう1つ、大きな違いはインフラにOpenSolarisを採用していることだ。基調講演では、同日正式リリースした「OpenSolaris 2009.06」をクラウド関連と同じぐらい時間を割いて紹介してたが、インフラOSとしてのOpenSolarisは強力に進化を続けている。
クラウドに関連するOpenSolarisの注目ポイントはファイルシステムの「ZFS」、システム分析ツールの「DTrace」、仮想化などに対応するために新たに書き起こされたネットワークスタックの「 Crossbow」だ。
クラウド初 のSSDサポート？
ZFS はコピー・オン・ライトを基本とする次世代のファイルシステムだ。通常、フルコピーが必要となるボリューム全体のスナップショットなどでも、コピーが発生しない。コピーが必要となるのは、ファイルの追加や削除をしてからで、その差分だけがディスクに書き込まれる。このため、15分置きにスナップショットを取るようにしておけば、何か人為ミスのトラブルがあっても、すぐにロールバックが可能だ。何らかのソフトウェアのバージョンアップ中に問題が発生しても、すぐにやり直せるなど管理面でのメリットが大きい。
さらに、ZFSが2008年秋にSSDに対応した点も見逃せない。SSD対応は単に使えるようになったというだけではない。OSから見たメインメモリとキャッシュメモリの関係のように、ファイルシステムでシームレスに統合されている。このため、ボトルネックがI/OにあればSSDをストレージプールに追加し、容量が足りなくなればハードディスクを足すという柔軟な運用が可能だ。
Sun Cloudはクラウド上でSSDがシームレスに統合された形でサポートするプラットフォームになる可能性が高い。この点についてOpenSolaris担当者に話を聞いたところ、SSDとハードディスクの容量をクラウド上で任意に選択できるようにすることは十分にあり得るという話だ。
ZFS ではスナップショット作成に必要なディスク消費量が少ないので、自動的にスナップショットを取る設定にしておけば、編集前のファイルを容易に取り出せる。画面は同一の画像ファイルの古いバージョン（おたまじゃくし）と、最新バージョン（カエル）を表示。ZFSを備えたOpenSolarisはインフラOSとしてだけでなく、デスクトップOSとしても魅力的だ
仮想化を前提に書き換えられたネットワークスタック「Crossbow 」
ZFS がファイルシステムという大きなサブモジュールをスクラッチで書き直したものであるように、「Crossbow」はネットワークモジュールを書き直したものだ。OpenSolaris 2009.06で初めて統合された。
昨今のNICは、仮想化環境を想定して物理的なポートが1つだけであっても、独立した「レーン」が備わっていることがある。これらのレーンには個別にパケットバッファがある。こうしたNICの機能を、仮想化環境で最大限に生かすためにVNIC（仮想NIC）をサポートしたのがCrossbowだ。
Crossbowは仮想環境に最適化されたネットワークスタック
これまで仮想環境のNICへのパケットは、ホストOSやハイパーバイザがルーティングしていたが、VNICであれば、各仮想環境のNICは直接パケットを拾い出すことができる。これはセキュリティ上も、パフォーマンス上もメリットが大きい。
Crossbowではソフトウェア的にレーンを用意し、ハードウェアレーンがある限りこれを割り当てる。もし、仮想サーバが増えてハードウェアレーンが足りなくなれば、足りない分はソフトウェアレーンに割り当てるようフォールバックする。
Crossbowでは負荷が高くなったときのパフォーマンス低下を抑える「ダイナミック・ポーリング」の機能を実装しているという。パケット受信速度がパケット処理速度以下の場合には、各NICのパケットは割り込みによってCPUが処理するが、どこかのレーンで受信速度が処理速度を超えると、そこは自動的にポーリングモードに切り替わる。ポーリングモードでは、CPU（パケット処理用のスレッド）は一定間隔でレーンに蓄積したパケットを、パケットチェーンとしてまとめて受け取る。これはネットワークのスループットやCPUリソースの面で有利だという。
Crossbowは仮想環境におけるセキュリティ（OSインスタンスの分離）やパフォーマンス向上以外にも、メリットがある。
1つは、特定ポートの帯域制御などをダイナミックな管理が容易になることだ。これはOpenSolarisがOSレベルでVNICに対応しているからこそできることで、基調講演のデモンストレーションでは、特定の仮想サーバのNICだけ帯域を半分に絞って、実際に即座にスループットを示すグラフがガクンと曲線を描くさまを披露していた。
仮想環境に割り当てたVNICは帯域制限などが簡単にできるという。グラフが帯域制限直後に落ち込んでいるのが分かる
もう1つはDTraceによるネットワークパフォーマンスのプロファイリングが容易になることだ。これまでにもDTraceによるCPUや各アプリケーションのパフォーマンスのプロファイリングが可能だったが、Crossbowが入ったことで、OpenSolarisではCIFS、NFS、FTPなどプロトコルレベルでのパフォーマンス監視が容易になるという。Webアプリケーションでは、多数のサーバ、多数のアプリケーションが分散して走ることが多いが、そうした場合でも、ボトルネックが言語処理系なのかネットワークなのか、ディスクI/Oなのか、といったことが容易に把握できるという。
プロファイリングツールのDTraceではネットワーク系ファイルシステムも見られるようになった
遅延発生頻度も直感的なグラフで見ることができる
基調講演のデモンストレーションを通して眺めてみると、サンがクラウドで提供しようとしているものが単なるリソースではなく、むしろ「ITシステム」であることが分かる。Amazon EC2がインスタンス指向、Google App EngineやSalesforce.comがアプリケーション指向であるとするなら、Sun Cloudはシステム指向と言えそうだ。

After four Indiana Jones movies , is anyone surprised that Steven Spielberg 's first Wii game already has a sequel ?
Boom Blox Bash Party , released last week , is the follow - up to last year 's unlikely Spielberg - helmed hit game , Boom Blox .
The physics - based puzzle game won over critics with its charm , masterful use of the Wii's motion controls , and appeal across the casual / hard - core divide .
The short - order sequel delivers more of what we loved and less of what we did n't , tacking on loads of new ways to have fun with physics and destruction .
But the best part is Bash Party 's new , nearly hassle - free level - sharing feature .
It lets gamers create their own levels and share them online with the rest of the world , meaning that the bash party is never over .
As in the original Boom Blox , you 'll work your way through a lengthy series of puzzles that deal with physics .
You might need to smash a tower of blocks by throwing baseballs with the Wiimote , or gently tug blocks out of a tower without toppling it over .
To make things more interesting , Bash Party adds different environments that change the game 's fundamental physics .
Some levels take place in space or underwater , requiring you to put extra thought into how objects will move around before you start throwing them .
If you 're looking for something a bit more action - oriented , you 'll enjoy the stages that arm you with cannons or laser pistols , then task you with shooting at gems while fighting off foes — like flying saucers or manic monkeys armed with baseballs — that threaten your delicate structures .
As you play , you 're constantly rewarded for your efforts :
You 'll earn medals and Boom Bux ( the game 's currency ) for completing levels , Achievement awards for completing certain goals and a number of unlockable tools and bricks that you can use in Bash Party 's level editor .
For such a cheery - looking game , the difficulty escalates fairly quickly .
Earning Bronze and Silver medals for each level is n't too tough , but snagging Gold medals often demands incredible skill and / or blind luck .
If you 'd rather not beat every single level , you can always spend a few Boom Bux to unlock content that would otherwise be hidden behind difficult challenges .

Bash Party offers both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes .
Versus mode might see you blasting apart your friends ' structures and relieving them of their gems , while co-op encourages players to work together , taking turns constructing elaborate towers or dismantling them as a team under strict time limits .
The revamped level editor gives players the ability create levels from scratch or modify existing levels to suit their needs .
Sharing levels is easier , too :
You do n't need to enter Nintendo 's onerous " friend codes " to share levels with other people .
Electronic
Arts moderates the levels for inappropriate content and shares approved ones with every gamer .
While EA populated the game with more than 400 puzzles , chances are you wo n't find enough of the ones you like best .
But fear not :
There 's a delightfully simple option for finding more .
On each set of levels , just click " download more " and Bash Party will search the servers for levels with rule sets similar to the one you 're playing .
To search more broadly , you can go to the game 's Download menu and choose between Solo , Cooperative and Versus levels , or a Freestyle section chock - full of user creations that lack rules and are just for fun .
You can edit any level that you download and re-upload your edited version , although the game will always keep track of the original creator , giving credit where it 's due .
But while it 's easy to find more levels , getting exactly what you want can be a chore .
There 's no option to simply browse through groups of levels , and the search function could be much more useful .
Typing " bomb " or " explosion " wo n't find all the levels that have bombs in them — just the few that actually include those specific words in their title or brief description .
Until more intrepid users start loading their descriptions with search terms , good luck trying to track down quirky new Rube Goldberg machines or some of the more whimsical creations that the first game had to offer .
As with most puzzle game sequels , this return to Boom Blox does n't attempt to reinvent the wheel .
Many of the origina 's flaws are still here , from hyper - realistic physics models that do n't work the way you planned to those tedious multiplayer levels where you 're forced to knock every last block off the stage .
On the whole , though , Boom Blox Bash Party is still a challenging and fun experience , bolstered by a potentially limitless supply of user - generated content to keep the game fresh .

Above , an earlier a rough cut of the film Invisible Children .
The movie appears to be an ongoing work in progress , and as much an advocacy movement as much as it is a work of filmmaking .
Richard Metzger writes ,
This is one of the most fucked up things I have ever heard of : A Ugandan warlord by the name of Joseph Kony kidnaps children from their parents who are powerless to do anything about it .
He is feared as if he has voodoo powers and any kids trying to escape from his army have their tongues cut out or are killed .
The young guys who organized the " How it Ends " event made the film .
I saw it on Rick Sanchez 's CNN show last month at the gym and it is WEIRD and disturbing .
I ran home and looked it up .
The interesting thing about their movie ( much of it online at their site ) is that they were these these young guys from San Diego who made skateboarding videos and were best friends .
They had the idea to go to Africa to have an adventure and shoot it for a movie .
What they found was Joseph Kony 's child army .
The story had not been really been told before that .
They brought it back with them and started a movement .
They 've been on Oprah and Larry King .
They 're heroes , full stop .
It 's riveting scary , stuff .
A nightmare .
A human rights disaster of the worst kind .

Sri Lankan soldiers killed at least 180 elite Tamil Tiger fighters carrying out waves of counterattacks , and the pace of refugees fleeing the tiny war zone picked up speed , the military said today .
Heavy combat erupted over the weekend , suggesting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) were mounting a desperate defence against a military onslaught that has confined them to 17 square miles in the Indian Ocean island 's northeast .

Since Saturday , the LTTE 's elite Charles Anthony Brigade and Radha Regiment have attempted to punch through the army 's frontline , the military said .
" Now they have not held back .
Their elite fighters have been deployed to stop troops from entering those areas , " military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said .
Nanayakkara said that a total of 180 bodies had been found since the weekend , including 80 today .
The LTTE appears to have saved its best - trained fighters for the final battle , he said .
The Radha Regiment is the personal protection unit for LTTE leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran , whose whereabouts are unknown .
" There may be leaders confined in that area and they want to protect them .
They are desperately fighting to prevent government troops from coming in , " Nanayakkara said .
Also over the weekend , at least 676 civilians escaped the war zone , some on foot but the vast majority by boat , Nanayakkara said .
The Red Cross estimates 150,000 people are still trapped , but the government says the number is no more than 70,000 .
After 25 years of off - and - on civil war , Sri Lanka 's military is racing toward a final battle to crush the separatist group as a conventional force .
The only thing slowing its advance is the presence of tens of thousands of civilians , mostly being held by the LTTE at gunpoint and suffering in what aid agencies say are dire conditions in a narrow coastal strip the army has declared a no - fire zone .

Also today , the military said the LTTE fired artillery toward a ship flying the flag of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) that had landed food and aid supplies there .
The ICRC confirmed there had been shelling near the ship , which was not hit , and said the navy had ordered it to return to port because bad weather had made offloading cargo difficult .
" We have no reason to believe the cargo vessel was directly targeted , " spokeswoman Sophie Romanens said .
" It 's a conflict zone so shelling is going on all over the place , so it is not possible to see who fired it . "
The Tigers could not be reached for comment but has repeatedly denied accusations from witnesses and aid agencies that they have attacked civilians or fired artillery from inside the no-fire zone .
The pro-rebel website www.TamilNet.com, quoting an unnamed source , reported the LTTE had launched an artillery attack over the weekend that killed a " considerable number of soldiers " .
Nanayakkara acknowledged some soldiers had been killed : " We have suffered casualties , but we are not releasing the numbers . "
Both sides in the past have distorted battlefield figures to their advantage , and independent confirmation is difficult since the war zone is normally sealed off to outside observers .
The LTTE since 1983 has fought a civil war to create a separate homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority , which complains of mistreatment by successive governments led by the Sinhalese ethnic majority since independence from Britain in 1948 .
Tengzhong is known in China for making a wide range of road equipment , from bridge piers to highway construction and maintenance machinery .
But even before the Hummer deal , the company had been moving more into heavy - duty trucks , including tow trucks and oil tankers .
“ Over all , we ’re pretty pleased , ” said a Hummer spokesman , Nick Richards .
“ If you think about the qualities we ’d want in a new owner for the brand , this buyer really met all the criteria .
They ’ve got a proven track record in international business , and they ’ve got a long - term vision for the brand .
They ’ve got the capital to invest in more efficient vehicles , which is what ’s necessary to grow the brand . ”
If the deal is completed , it would be the first acquisition of a well - known American auto brand by a Chinese company , after many months of speculation about such a deal .
Chinese automakers have already purchased the MG and Rover brands , two of the most famous names in British automotive history .
As a Chinese company , Tengzhong could face a challenge in presenting the deal to American Hummer owners .
The brand has long sought to emphasize patriotism , stressing that the Hummer H1 was essentially the same vehicle built in the same factory as the Humvee that carries American soldiers into battle in Iraq and elsewhere .
It was Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California who persuaded the longtime maker of Humvees , A. M. General in Mishawaka , Ind. , to build a civilian version .
As he recounted at a Hummer news conference in 2001 , Mr. Schwarzenegger was filming the movie “ Kindergarten Cop ” in Oregon in 1990 when he saw a convoy of 50 Humvees drive by and decided that he had to have a civilian model of the same vehicle , which became the Hummer H1 .
G.M. bought the rights to the Hummer brand in 1999 and began making somewhat smaller Hummers .
G.M. initially procured the H1 from A. M. General , but discontinued the model in 2006 .
Under the preliminary agreement announced on Tuesday , G.M. will initially continue to manufacture Hummers under contract for Tengzhong , which will then market them around the world .
G.M. will continue making the H3 and H3T models in Shreveport , La. , through the end of next year and the company said it might enter into a long - term agreement to build Hummers and important parts for Tengzhong .
Do n't believe everything you see on television — even when it 's reported by a major Japanese television network — and especially when reported by TBS , it seems .
Earlier , it was reported by TBS News that the Ethics Organization of Computer Software had voluntarily agreed to halt the sale and manufacture of " rape - type " games .
Too bad nobody told the EOCS , because the organization was surprised to see this reported by TBS and later picked up by Yahoo !
News Japan .

So what happened ?
Back when Rapelay controversy reached Japan , TBS came to the EOCS to do an interview , but then edited the footage to misrepresent the organization 's intended stance .
TBS recently asked to do another interview with the EOCS , who declined this request .
Still , TBS ran this story , regardless .
Apparently , nothing will go into effect on June 2 .
There is merely a meeting then , and this news report came out of nowhere .
On erotic game industry insider says that even if the organization had decided to prohibit the games , companies would have until past July to comply with the new regulations .
What 's more , the used game market will probably be unaffected .

There are even rumblings that this news report is a news campaign on the part of the New Komeito Party , which has previously expressed disapproval of these types of games .
This is unconfirmed , but supposedly the Japanese Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry told a New Komeito party rep that there was going to be a meeting on June 2 — information that apparently was passed on to TBS .
This some how became rape games will be banned on June 2 .
Like we said , all unconfirmed .

Those connected with the EOCS do see tighter regulations for these types of games , but not necessarily prohibition .

MADRID / GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The World Health Organisation is likely to raise its flu alert to the top of its six - point scale and declare a pandemic , its director - general indicated in an interview published on Monday .
In remarks setting the scene for another alert increase , but without saying when , WHO chief Margaret Chan warned against over - confidence following a stabilisation in the number of new cases of the H1N1 strain that has proved deadly in Mexico .
“ Level 6 does not mean , in any way , that we are facing the end of the world .
It is important to make this clear because ( otherwise ) when we announce level 6 it will cause an unnecessary panic , ” she told Spanish newspaper El Pais .
“ Flu viruses are very unpredictable , very deceptive ...
We should not be over - confident .
One must not give H1N1 the opportunity to mix with other viruses .
That is why we are on alert . ”
The WHO ’s pandemic phases reflect views about how a virus is spreading , and not how severe its effects are .
Last week the United Nations agency raised the alert level twice , from 3 to the current 5 , in response to the sustained transmission of H1N1 in Mexico and the United States .
Before issuing a level 6 alert , the WHO would need to see the virus spreading within communities in Europe or Asia .
A declaration of a full pandemic would send a signal to governments worldwide to institute their pandemic response plans , which may include measures affecting hospitals , schools or public events .
Phase 6 would also trigger increased support for developing countries which lack the drugs , diagnostic tests , and medical staff to respond appropriately to the flu that the WHO has said could be especially dangerous for people with HIV / AIDS .
While the top - level alert would not have an automatic effect on the world ’s flu vaccine production , the WHO is expected to make an announcement alongside any such declaration to specify whether manufacturers should switch from making seasonal to pandemic flu vaccines .
In her remarks to El Pais , Chan said that weather patterns could play an important role in how the flu continues to spread .
The southern hemisphere is about to enter winter , when seasonal flu cases normally spike , the infectious disease expert said .
“ We have to be very careful .
No one can predict what is going to happen when countries in the south have flu peaks and this new one arrives -- which it is going to do , without a doubt , ” she said .
On Sunday , a WHO spokesman said the relatively large number of infections in Spain of what has been commonly known as swine flu -- at 40 , according to the WHO ’s count -- seemed to be mainly “ imported ” cases involving people returning from Mexico , the epicentre of the disease outbreak .
Chan echoed this and said that so far , there were not many flu patients in Europe that have not been to Mexico or had direct contact with those who had .
“ It is true that the number is small , but because of that I would say that we have not seen the full situation or the whole picture of what is happening .
The situation is evolving and the virus is changing , ” she said .
Chan , who fought SARS and bird flu in her previous job as Hong Kong ’s health director , said it was too early to predict what proportion of the population would catch the new flu strain after the European Union predicted 40 percent of the population would become infected .
Most entrepreneurs fight valiantly to keep their companies afloat in the face of mounting expenses and declining revenue .
But when finally forced to accept that they can't pay their bills , many simply throw up their hands and stop making rational decisions .
That 's a mistake -- because even after a business fails , an owner has important choices to make .
In general , a company can take one of three routes : reorganization , which allows it to stay in business ; outright sale ; or piecemeal liquidation of the assets .
Each can happen in a formal bankruptcy process -- but does n't need to .
That is crucial .
Many people , even business owners , mistakenly equate insolvency and bankruptcy .
The former means you are unable to pay debts as they come due ; the latter is the formal and voluntary legal process of resolving insolvency in federal court .
( Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code covers liquidation ; Chapter 11 , reorganization . )
Formal bankruptcy does stop the clock , giving you a temporary reprieve from creditors , but it also has negative consequences .
In fact , for most small companies , it is n't a good option at all .
These pages offer guidelines for strategically closing out an unfortunate chapter of your business life .
That 's right : chapter .
Running out of money does n't mean that your entrepreneurial days are over .
Most successful entrepreneurs have gone bust at some point .
But the decisions you make at the time could have a great impact on your ability to start your next venture .
Resolving Insolvency
1. Own Up to the Problem
Entrepreneurs tend to be optimistic even in the face of real problems -- and as a corollary , they often have difficulty accepting defeat .
( See " The Psychology of Insolvency , " last page . )
If your business is sinking , it 's crucial to recognize it before opportunities for saving it -- or shutting it down efficiently -- have dwindled .
The first and most basic warning sign is that you are not making money when you ought to be .
Of course , some start - ups do n't turn a profit early on .
But in most cases , within a year or two , a company 's revenue should support expenses and follow predictable trends .
If not , consider winding down the business , or at least consult a trusted adviser .
Do n't make a bad situation worse .
Avoid measures that compound the problem -- financing inventory with a credit card , for instance , or through a factor .
In addition to exposing you to high interest rates , credit cards usually leave the business owner , not the company , responsible for the debt .
Even more dangerous is skipping taxes to meet short - term obligations .
The penalties on payroll taxes can be draconian , and interest alone can add another 5 percent to 8 percent a year .
Worse , company officers can be held personally liable for the obligation , which never goes away , even in bankruptcy -- and exemptions that keep other creditors at bay do n't apply to the state or federal government .
Keep your savings to yourself .
Above all , never use personal savings , especially retirement funds , to meet your obligations .
" The business leg of your financial stool is already weak ; do n't weaken the personal leg , too , " says Donald Rhodes , area director at the University of Georgia Small Business Development Center in Macon .
Moreover , if you have any chance to reorganize , you may need that money to recapitalize .
2. Prioritize Your Debts
If you do file for bankruptcy , the court will determine ( or approve a plan for ) how much creditors get .
Until that point , be strategic about whom you pay and when .
Pay secured creditors first .
Vendors may be more aggressive in demanding payment than your bank , but resist the temptation to satisfy the loudest voice first .
Your bank loan is likely secured by company assets and possibly your own as well .
Your bankers , not your suppliers , control your destiny .
Conserve cash .
Businesses considering reorganization will need cash to finance operations during the process .
Companies that do n't anticipate outside financing should stop paying unsecured vendors as soon as possible , advises Suzanne Caplan , a turnaround consultant in Pittsburgh .
On the other hand , you can't afford to alienate vendors altogether , because you will still need them to ship inventory .
Do n't play favorites .
It 's better to pay all unsecured creditors something than to concentrate on a few .
In formal bankruptcy , an appointed administrator may sue to recover and redistribute preferential payments , eating up cash that could satisfy your debts or fund your operations .
3 . Try to Reorganize
From the entrepreneur 's perspective , reorganization is usually the best outcome , because it keeps the business operating in his or her hands .
This most commonly means negotiating with creditors to either lower the principal owed ( perhaps in exchange for equity ) or stretch out payments to lower the monthly bill .
The negotiations typically involve convincing lenders that if they do n't lighten your burden now , they are likely to get back much less later .
Works best when …you are breaking even or turning an operating profit but are hamstrung by debt .
In court or out ?
For many reasons , including the legal , accounting , and other professional costs of Chapter 11 , it 's best to negotiate a reorganization outside of court .
( See " The Vanishing Chapter 11 , " last page . )
But if you can't come to terms with all your creditors and have to seek shelter in court , you may still be able to save time ( and money ) with a prepackaged bankruptcy in which your biggest creditors preapprove your turnaround plan .
" You herd the big cows together , then rope in the others in court , " says Pittsburgh turnaround expert Maggie Good .
4. Try Selling Outright
A troubled business ( or division ) will often thrive in someone else 's hands .
And a whole business is generally worth more than the sum of its parts .
There may even be a job with the new owner .
Works best when …the organization has an asset of particular value , one or more distinctly profitable divisions , or a strategic fit with a particular suitor .
Still , buyer financing is hard to come by , and buyers know time is on their side .
Good suggests creative dealmaking , such as seller financing or agreeing to a low upfront payment .
In court or out ?
A sale can occur under Chapter 11 , but a debtor who wants a structured proceeding without the high costs of bankruptcy can arrange what 's known as assignment for the benefit of creditors .
Here , an independent third party ( the assignee ) disposes of the assets under state law .
5. Liquidate
Selling a business in pieces usually brings the lowest price and puts everyone out of work .
Liquidation can be self - managed or conducted by a appointed trustee under Chapter 7 .
In court or out ?
Most turnaround consultants say your own efforts will raise more money than a court - sanctioned process -- a trustee is not likely to go the extra mile -- and thus earn more goodwill among creditors .
On the other hand …running your own liquidation sale can be emotionally draining and -- because you may need professional help to sell specialized equipment or other assets -- expensive .
Chapter 7 , says Caplan , has the virtue of extracting you from " a really negative environment that makes restarting your own life very difficult . "
The Psychology of Insolvency
Get objective advice .
Because entrepreneurs invest so much of their lives in their ventures , it 's understandable they are often the last to recognize a dismal situation .
So if you see warning signs , seek an independent adviser who can tell you to stick to your guns or help you decide how to tackle insolvency .
You 'll almost certainly need an adviser if you hope to reorganize , because your lender is unlikely to take you at your word that you can turn things around .
Lenders are increasingly requiring businesses to hire turnaround consultants .
Communicate regularly with stakeholders .
Difficult as it may be , answer the phone when creditors call , and keep them informed , even if you have nothing good to report .
It builds trust and may help persuade a creditor to participate in a reorganization .
Similarly , you will depend on your employees to see you through to the end , and they , too , will share in the consequences .
You owe it to them , says Kristin Johnson , the director of the Northern California SBDC Network , to give them as much information in advance as possible and support them as they seek new work .
Keep your emotions in check .
You may believe that your creditors are trying to bury you , and you may even be right .
But poise will serve you well in the long run , especially if you seek work in your industry or hope to plan a new venture .
" You 're going to be living in that community for a long time , " says Maggie Good , " so you want people to think that even though your company failed , you did whatever you could to get what you could for them . "
The Vanishing Chapter 11
Chapter 11 bankruptcy is not so widely used as it once was .
Companies with less than $ 2.2 million in debt , in particular , face a truncated process that leaves them at a potential disadvantage , says Dallas bankruptcy attorney Paul Keiffer .
Moreover , attorneys say that changes to the law in 2005 made it harder for debtors to conserve cash or obtain financing during a Chapter 11 proceeding .
Partly as a result , the rate of Chapter 11 filings dropped by more than a third .
And now , lawyers say , less than 25 percent of companies that file for Chapter 11 emerge successfully reorganized .
That said , turnaround consultants and lawyers insist that a company 's odds of succeeding improve dramatically if it has a plan going in .
Most businesses , they say , do n't .
" If you have two weeks to a month to prepare , that 's a real luxury , " Keiffer says .
Electronic book readers may be the future of publishing , but in one important respect , they 're still stuck in 1950 : Almost every e-book reader on the market has a black - and - white display .
Most can't display more than a handful of different shades of gray .
That 's why display makers are racing to bring color to the world of e-books .
Their goal is to make Gray 's Anatomy and its more than 1,200 full - color illustrations as interesting as the next Dan Brown novel .
The hitch is that color e-ink technologies are n't anywhere near ready for prime time .
Amazon chief Jeff Bezos recently told shareholders that a Kindle with a color screen is " multiple years " away .
" There 's no doubt color displays can offer much more compared to black and white , which is why we are working on it , " says Sri Peruvemba , vice president of marketing for E Ink .
" And so far we have hit all the milestones that we had set for ourselves . "
Last week E Ink was acquired by Taiwanese company Prime View International for $ 215 million .
E - book readers have become the hottest consumer products of the year .
Since the first e-reader was introduced by Sony in 2006 , and particularly since the introduction of Amazon.com 's popular Kindle in 2008 , demand for e-readers has taken off .
More than 1 million black - and - white displays have been sold so far , says E Ink , whose black - and - white displays power most of the e-readers on the market .
And there are more than 15 e-reader models currently available or in the works .
With the exception of the Flepia , though , almost all e-readers are monochromatic .
So what 's the technological holdup ?
To understand that , you first have to understand how E Ink 's black - and - white displays work .
Electronic ink , pioneered by the company , is composed of millions of microcapsules .
Each microcapsule has positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid .
When a positive electric field is applied , the black particles are attracted to the top and become visible to the user .
That makes that area appear black .
The reverse is also true : A negative electric field draws white particles to the top , making the area appear lighter .
For an electronic display , the ink is printed on a sheet of plastic film , and a layer of circuitry is laminated to it to drive the ink .
For a color display , E Ink needs to put a color filter on top of its black - and - white display .
A color filter usually has four sub-pixels – red , green , blue and white – that are combined to create each full - color pixel .
That also means reduced brightness of display .
" With four sub - pixels , we get only a fourth of the area that we use today in the black - and - white displays .
That means the resolution of the black and white display needs to get higher for the color filter to be effective , " says Peruvemba .
A 6 - inch E Ink black - and - white display has a SVGA resolution of 800 x 600 pixels .
To put a color filter on top would require the underlying display to have almost double the existing resolution .
The color filters also block a large amount of light , making the displays look dull and washed out , says Young .
" The challenge is to balance the color output of the filter with the amount of light blocked by it , " he says .
The good news ?
When E
Ink figures it out , its black - and - white displays will be better than ever , says Young .
E Ink says it is on track for large scale production of color displays at the end of next year .
At the recent DisplayWeek conference in San Antonio , Texas , E Ink showed off prototypes of its color screen .
Meanwhile , E Ink rival Kent Displays has already seen its color screen included in the Fujistu's Flepia , the only color e-reader available today .
The Flepia is for sale in Japan only .
Other contenders in the race for color e-reader displays include Pixel Qi , the startup founded by former One Laptop Per Child project CTO Mary Lou Jepsen , and Qualcomm .
Qualcomm could improve its existing line of low power displays called Mirasol and introduce a color version next year .
There 's a caveat .
E-readers with color displays can't match up to the standards set by LCD and now OLED displays .
" Color displays for e-readers does n't have anywhere the contrast ratio of LCDs or OLED , " says Barry Young , managing director of the OLED association .
" For color electrophoretic displays , the contrast is down to about 20 to 1 , while for LCDs it is in the 1,000s to 1 and for OLEDs is 10,000s to 1 range . "
" People do n't like color screens that are dark , " says Raj Apte , manager of prototype devices and circuits for PARC , formerly known as Xerox PARC , " and so far , the displays for e-readers we have seen lack the brightness that makes color screens attractive . "
E Ink 's rivals are facing their own challenges .
Kent 's color screens are based on cholesteric LCDs ( liquid cyrstals where the molecules are arranged with their axes parallel to each other in one layer and then are displaced a little for each following layer to give them a helix - like structure . )
The advantage with cholesteric LCDs is that they consume much lower power than traditional LCDS and are bistable – which means they can retain their image even when the power is lost .
These LCDs stack red , green and blue films to create a color display .
The trade - off for them is the refresh rate , says Young .
" It operates in three stages , so we are looking at a refresh rate of probably a second for a page compared to say a Kindle 2's 250 milliseconds , " he says .
The stacking process also raises questions of whether Kent 's displays can be thinner than its competitors .
" Thickness is just an engineering issue that can be solved with the use of the right substrate , " says Asad Hussain , vice president of technology for Kent Displays .
A problem that wo n't go away as easily will be in convincing e-reader makers to choose Kent Displays over rival E Ink , which has proven its mettle .
A 16 - year - old private company , Kent has been showing demos of its color screens for years .
But so far , other than Fujitsu , it has n't found any takers , at least none announced publicly .
Hussain blames the reluctance of e-reader manufacturers to introduce color displays .
" Right now black - and - white displays have momentum and though everyone wants color , no one is willing to make the shift . "

This is a really good shot of some busy kittens learning thier world .
Mom 's face says alot about her life .
She loves her babies but at the same time she has had enough of being thier playground .
The little one on her head has different things saying about them .
Like he / she is bragging to the others about being king / queen of the moutian .
Or maybe saying " Help !!
I 'm up too high !!" And all the others do n't care .
Mom 's going to have her paws full with that one .
The angle of the shot is good .
You would n't get the same looks , feelings if it would have been head on .

Were you sad the U.S.S.
Enterprise was such a sausage - fest in the most recent Star Trek ?
Then there 's good news : co-writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman tell io9 the next film could feature one of Trek 's most iconic women .

Yeoman Janice Rand , with her imposing blonde beehive , only appeared in a handful of Trek episodes before disappearing ( reportedly because star William Shatner wanted Kirk to have more the opportunity to mack on different women every week . )
But since she has a fairly major role in " Charlie X " and " The Enemy Within , " she 's always stood out as one of the most significant female characters on the show , up there with Uhura and Nurse Chapel .
Talking to Orci and Kurtzman about Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen , we asked them about strong female characters .
The first movie featured Rachael Taylor as Maggie Madsen , the hacker who figures out what 's going on with those alien robots before everyone else does .
We were sad that Maggie does n't turn up in the new movie , and Orci explained why :
We ended up going to a whole new set of characters , and Maggie 's replacement starts to feel like it was organic given the theme of this new story .
We always [ want to have strong female characters ] .
Going back to movies like Aliens , Ripley was the original ass - kicker .
And that goes back to Westerns , even .
So we felt like we always like to have a strong woman at the center of the movie .

Kurtzman adds :
Having made our bones on Xena and Alias ... that 's why it leads to decisions , like in the first movie , Sam wants to get the cute girl .
But she can't just be that , so she 's actually going to know more about cars than Sam .
She 's the one who knows that stuff , not him .
That 's why we had Maggie .
She 's the one who figures that stuff out , and not the uniformed men at the Pentagon .
That always makes it more interesting for us .

So on that note , we asked if it 's possible that more of the original female characters from Trek might turn up in the sequel .
Could we see Yeoman Rand in Trek 2 ?
Kurtzman says :
It 's possible , for sure ...
We 're going back and watching the shows again , just getting a refresher course and training before we jump back in .

Here 's hoping the sequel does feature more resourceful , interesting women characters — and Uhura gets to be more than a love interest for Spock .
And an appearance by Rand , maybe as an ensign this time around , would be terrific — even though her main function in the original series was to be hit on by horny super - teens and bestial Kirk - twins , she always seemed to have a core of strength and integrity inside of her .
She 's certainly not afraid to claw your face off if you get out of line .
It would be great to see that brought out more .
The recent movie had no problem reimagining characters like Scotty and Chekov somewhat , so there 's no reason we could n't see a slightly different Janice Rand .
Here 's hoping !
DETROIT 
Even after receiving $ 15.4 billion in federal loans , General Motors is once again on the brink of financial collapse .
The automaker ’s first - quarter earnings released Thursday showed that G.M. was losing more money and sales than it was in late December , when the government began its bailout .
With its cash reserves down to the bare minimum and its revenue plunging , G.M. seems more certain each day to be heading toward a bankruptcy filing .
The company is entering the final stages of producing , by June 1 , a restructuring plan that is acceptable to President Obama and his auto task force .
Monash University research shows a high proportion of overweight airline passengers buy two seats to save themselves embarrassment .
One frequent flier suggests the aviation industry , especially given its current downturn , should be doing more to accommodate obese fliers .
Terry , who has struggled with obesity for the past 15 years , flies about twice a month .
" I get an aisle seat , because that gives me room for overhang , let 's put it that way , " he said .
" And it certainly becomes a very intimate exercise if someone who 's also obese is sitting next to me ; but we make allowances for each other . "
He says he has never offered to pay for two seats , nor will he .
" Why should I ?
It 's not my fault that the airlines made the seats so small .
I 'm not two people , " he said .
" That would be highly discriminating , obesity is a functional disability .
" Do they ask people who have to be put on plane by forklift to pay for the forklift if [ they ] have a wheelchair ?
" If people have small child , where they use a bulkhead cradle for that child , are they expected to pay extra for the bulkhead cradle ? "
Terry cites airlines , theatres and clothing stores as three offenders which have failed to adapt to society 's obesity problem .
" There 's a large minority of people who are overweight or obese .
It is a social problem , " he said .
" There are sometimes medical reasons why people are overweight or obese , but it 's something which is now very common in society .
" It 's regrettable that 's the case but it 's a fact of life and I think we need to adjust as a society to this . "
Embarrassment , discrimination
Monash University health sociologist Dr Samantha Thomas has been researching discrimination felt by obese people , especially on planes .
" Quite often an obese person will have to ask for an extension seat for their seatbelt and quite often they are met with some very disparaging or embarrassing remarks like it's a hassle for the cabin crew to go and get a seatbelt extension for them , " she said .
" The second thing we find is that quite often normal - weight passengers will quite overtly say they do n't want to sit next to a fat person on the plane , that they 're physically uncomfortable because of it , that they do n't want to and that the person should be moved . "
Dr Thomas says many choose to fork out more money for two seats , to pre-empt embarrassment .
" What we 've found is that either the airline industry will stop them from buying two seats or when they come to board the plane , they 'll find that the two seats that they 've been allocated are in vastly different sections of the plane , " she said .
" So no matter what people try to do to overcome this , they 're still faced with that level of embarrassment when they fly . "
Dr Thomas says it is hard to know how to deal with the discrimination some people face .
" How do we judge how fat is too fat ?
What we know about our measurements of obesity is that actually if we took those same measurements and applied them to some of our elite athletes , our rugby players or our AFL players , they'd be judged to be fat as well , which obviously is not the case , " she said .
" What do we do if we 're publicly and openly humiliating fat people on a plane , do we do the same to thin people ?
" Do we say , excuse me Mr Smith in seat 10C , you 've been judged to have been half the size of all your fellow passengers , so we 're going to give you a 50 per cent discount ?
" It 's really unfair and the overt way in which they do this is quite unacceptable . "
Weight policy
Dr Thomas says of all the airlines , her interviewees say they have had the least problems with Jetstar .
Jetstar 's Simon Westaway says where possible , it tries to allocate overweight passengers a seat next to a vacant one .
Otherwise it encourages them to purchase two .
" It 's not implicit , but if a customer wishes to purchase additional seat they can obtain that additional seat and at time of check - in they 're allocated the two seats they 've purchased and we just consider it like a second customer travelling , " he said .
" From our perspective we 've had the same policy for over five years . "
Mr Westaway says Jetstar has people regularly purchasing extra seats .
" We do have regular customers who book additional seats for themselves for extra comfort , " he said .
" The reality is no court in Australia has proven that obesity is a disability .
" We acknowledge that there is an ongoing debate around this ; different countries and different jurisdictions are going down a certain path from the Australian experience .
We think the way that Australian airlines operate encourages choice . "
Terry , however , says airlines should work around passengers , not the other way around .
" I will vote with my feet or with my bottom if airline chooses to make it compulsory to buy two seats because I 'm overweight .
I 'll go to those airlines that do n't , " he said .

Victims of child abuse at Catholic institutions in the Irish Republic have expressed anger that a damning report will not bring about prosecutions .
The report , nine years in the making and covering a period of six decades , found thousands of boys and girls were terrorised by priests and nuns .
Government inspectors failed to stop beatings , rapes and humiliation .
John Walsh , of Irish Survivors of Child Abuse , said he felt " cheated and deceived " by the lack of prosecutions .
The findings will not be used for criminal prosecutions - in part because the Christian Brothers successfully sued the commission in 2004 to keep the identities of all of its members , dead or alive , unnamed in the report .
No real names , whether of victims or perpetrators , appear in the final document .
It documents a shameful catalogue of cruelty : neglect , physical , sexual and emotional abuse , perpetrated against children
Cardinal Sean Brady
Leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland
Abuse report - at a glance Reaction to Irish abuse report Media and bloggers respond Mark Easton 's blog Mr Walsh said : " I would have never opened my wounds if I 'd known this was going to be the end result .
" It has devastated me and will devastate most victims because there are no criminal proceedings and no accountability whatsoever . "
Police were called to the Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse 's news conference in Dublin amid angry scenes as victims were prevented from attending .
The victims were among 35,000 children who were placed in a network of reformatories , industrial schools and workhouses until the early 1990s .
More than 1,000 people had told the commission they suffered physical and sexual abuse .
' Self - serving secrecy '
The five - volume study concluded that church officials encouraged ritual beatings and consistently shielded their orders ' paedophiles from arrest amid a " culture of self - serving secrecy " .
The commission found that sexual abuse was " endemic " in boys ' institutions , and church leaders knew what was going on .

It also found physical and emotional abuse and neglect were rife in some institutions .
Schools were run " in a severe , regimented manner that imposed unreasonable and oppressive discipline on children and even on staff " .
It found the Department of Education had generally dismissed or ignored complaints of child sexual abuse and dealt inadequately with them .
As far back as the 1940s , school inspectors reported broken bones and malnourished children but no action was taken .
The report proposed 21 ways the Irish government could recognise past wrongs , including building a permanent memorial , providing counselling and education to victims , and improving current child protection services .
The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland , Cardinal Sean Brady , said he was " profoundly sorry and deeply ashamed that children suffered in such awful ways in these institutions " .
Campaigners protested at being excluded from the news conference " This report makes it clear that great wrong and hurt were caused to some of the most vulnerable children in our society , " he said .
" It documents a shameful catalogue of cruelty : neglect , physical , sexual and emotional abuse , perpetrated against children . "
The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales , the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols , said those who perpetrated violence and abuse should be held to account , " no matter how long ago it happened " .
" Every time there is a single incident of abuse in the Catholic Church , it is a scandal .
I would be very worried if it was n't a scandal ...
I hope these things do n't happen again , but I hope they 're never a matter of indifference , " he said .

Al Qaida is intent on using the internet to launch a cyber - warfare campaign against the UK , ministers claimed today .
They say terrorist groups , which already use the internet for recruitment , propaganda and communication purposes , want to turn it into a ' dangerous weapon ' .
Security Minister Lord West issued the warning as he published the Government 's new Cyber Security Strategy aimed at heading off online threats .
As well as potential cyber- attacks from terrorists , the UK faces a real and growing threat from foreign governments such as China and Russia , and from organised criminal gangs , he said .
Targets include key businesses , the national power grid , financial markets and Whitehall departments .
As part of attempts to beef up defences , a new Office for Cyber Security will be set up to co-ordinate Government policy .
Another new development will see the creation of a " cyber- forensics " team based at GCHQ , the Government 's eavesdropping centre in Cheltenham , Gloucestershire .
The Cyber Security Operations Centre will constantly monitor , analyse and counter cyber attacks as they happen .
Lord West said the terrorists ' capability to launch attacks was something he believed " will develop " in future .
" We know terrorists use the internet for radicalisation and things like that at the moment , but there is a fear they will move down that path ( of cyber attacks ) .
" As their ability to use the web and the net grows , there will be more opportunity for these attacks .
He confirmed that the UK Government has already faced cyber attacks from foreign states such as Russia and China .
But he denied that hackers had successfully broken into Government systems and stolen secret information .
He also said he could not deny that the Government has its own online attack capability , but he refused to say whether it had ever been used .
" It would be silly to say that we do n't have any capability to do offensive work from Cheltenham , and I do n't think I should say any more than that . "
Among those the Government has turned to for help on cyber crime are former illegal hackers , Lord West said .
He said GCHQ had not employed any " ultra , ultra criminals " but needed the expertise of former " naughty boys " he said .
" You need youngsters who are deep into this stuff , " he said .
" If they have been slightly naughty boys , very often they really enjoy stopping other naughty boys . "
The cyber strategy is part of the updated national security plan which was published for the first time this year .
It warns of the increased threat to this country as a result of the global economic meltdown .
Marking the launch of efforts to step up cyber security , the Prime Minister , Home Secretary and Security Minister visited a London consultancy dedicated to tackling the threat .
Gordon Brown , Alan Johnson and Lord West visited the " nerve centre " of Detica to see how the technology is developing .
Executives told the ministers how broadband internet was becoming the " fourth utility " - in addition to gas , water and electricity - and as such needed to be as free from viruses as a water source - " clean , safe and secure " .
Mr Brown said : " I think everybody knows the internet has expanded massively , information is flowing around the world , citizens are in danger of being victims of organised crime , there are potentially terrorist attacks on our community , so we are stepping up this strategic unit to look at cyber security . "
He said cyber crime constituted a significant global industry and British people needed to be protected from it .
" We must not be the victims of it , and the more we lead the world , as we are today , in cyber security , the more we can protect the citizens of our country .
" Some people are using organised crime to fund terrorist groups .
Some terrorist groups are using the internet in a wholly exploitative way .
" This is a national strategy for protecting Britain . "
Shadow security minister Baroness Neville - Jones said : " This action on cyber security is long overdue .
" But it is impossible to know how significant these announcements are because we do not know what funding will be made available to enhance our ability to tackle cyber threats .
" It is also not clear how these new cyber security structures fit into the existing national security machinery .
The Government has missed an opportunity to review and make sense of very muddled structures .
" Much more effort and resource also needs to be devoted to the growing menace of cyber crime .
" The need to produce such a substantial update to the National Security Strategy is an admission that the Government 's first strategy did not actually set direction for different departments .
" We are also left waiting for a lot of detail on organised crime , maritime security and energy security . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Tom Brake said : " This new cyber security strategy could lead to an extension of the Government 's invasive counter - terrorism powers , which already pose significant threats to our civil liberties .
" The cyber security strategy uses broad , undefined terms that risk creating panic among the public and a demand for further Government powers .
We must not retreat into a Cold War mentality .
" It is worrying that ministers have made no indication of how much these proposals will cost .
Too many Government schemes have seen taxpayers ' money being poured into a black hole .
" It is also unfortunate that the Government did not consider this strategy important enough to give Parliament an opportunity to debate this updated strategy on the floor of the House . "

Splash , splatter , babble , sploosh , drip , drop , bloop and ploop !
Those are some of the sounds that have been missing from computer graphic simulations of water and other fluids , according to researchers in Cornell 's Department of Computer Science , who have come up with new algorithms to simulate such sounds to go with the images .
The work by Doug James , associate professor of computer science , and graduate student Changxi Zheng will be reported at the 2009 ACM SIGGRAPH conference Aug. 3 - 7 in New Orleans .
It is the first step in a broader research program on sound synthesis supported by a $ 1.2 million grant from the Human Centered Computing Program of the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) to James , assistant professor Kavita Bala and associate professor Steve Marschner .
In computer - animated movies , sound can be added after the fact from recordings or by Foley artists .
But as virtual worlds grow increasingly interactive and immersive , the researchers point out , sounds will need to be generated automatically to fit events that can't be predicted in advance .
Recordings can be cued in , but can be repetitive and not always well matched to what 's happening .
" We have no way to efficiently compute the sounds of water splashing , paper crumpling , hands clapping , wind in trees or a wine glass dropped onto the floor , " the researchers said in their research proposal .
Along with fluid sounds , the research also will simulate sounds made by objects in contact , like a bin of Legos ; the noisy vibrations of thin shells , like trash cans or cymbals ; and the sounds of brittle fracture , like breaking glass and the clattering of the resulting debris .
All the simulations will be based on the physics of the objects being simulated in computer graphics , calculating how those objects would vibrate if they actually existed , and how those vibrations would produce acoustic waves in the air .
Physics - based simulations also can be used in design , just as visual simulation is now , James said .
" You can tell what it 's going to sound like before you build it , " he explained , noting that a lot of effort often goes into making things quieter .
In their SIGGRAPH paper , Zheng and James report that most of the sounds of water are created by tiny air bubbles that form as water pours and splashes .
Moving water traps air bubbles on the scale of a millimeter or so .
Surface tension contracts the bubbles , compressing the air inside until it pushes back and expands the bubble .
The repeated expansion and contraction over milliseconds generates vibrations in the water that eventually make its surface vibrate , acting like a loudspeaker to create sound waves in the air .
The simulation method developed by the Cornell researchers starts with the geometry of the scene , figures out where the bubbles would be and how they 're moving , computes the expected vibrations and finally the sounds they would produce .
The simulation is done on a highly parallel computer , with each processor computing the effects of multiple bubbles .
The researchers have fine - tuned the results by comparing their simulations with real water sounds .
Demonstration videos of simulations of falling , pouring , splashing and babbling water are available at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/HarmonicFluids.
The current methods still require hours of offline computing time , and work best on compact sound sources , the researchers noted , but they said further development should make possible the real - time performance needed for interactive virtual environments and deal with larger sound sources such as swimming pools or perhaps even Niagara Falls .
They also plan to approach the more complex collections of bubbles in foam or plumes .
The research reported in the SIGGRAPH paper was supported in part by an NSF Faculty Early Career Award to James , and by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , Pixar , Intel and Autodesk .
Tesla -cofounder Martin Eberhard 's lawsuits and smack - talking of the electric automaker 's got current CEO Elon Musk deciding to set the record straight in a ginormous blog post .
Bottom line :
He expects the company to be profitable next month .
Also , Eberhard sucks .

Along with airing pretty much all of Eberhard 's dirty laundry , refuting from his perception , all of the claims in the lawsuit , Musk also makes Eberhard look like something of an incompetent nincompoop .
There are some real stingers buried in the enormous writing , complete with emails copied in to back up Musk 's story , some of our favorites include :
There were several smaller items I suggested , such as the touchpad door latch that Eberhard tries to use as an excuse for why it cost over $ 140 M to bring the Roadster to market instead of the $ 25 M that he estimated in the 2004 business plan .
That would have to be one hell of door latch !
The $ 140 M excludes any costs associated with the Model S. "

and this not - so - subtle slap :
" All he had was a business plan to commercialize the AC Propulsion Tzero electric sports car concept .
Three years later , when Eberhard was asked to leave Tesla , most of the work that he had been paid to do had to be redone . "

Ouch .
In any case , Musk goes on to say over the last few years of work , the total bill of materials price which was pegged around $ 140 k when Eberhard was running the show has been reduced to around $ 80 k .
Along with improvements to the supply chain , the optional Tesla Roadster Sport and a run rate around 20 - 30 cars a week , Musk is expecting to see the company turn the corner and see profitability next month .

It 's a bit of a long read , but if you want a look at all of Tesla 's dirty laundry being aired in pretty much one place and understand a lot of the history behind the car and its delays , it 's well worth the time .

NOTE : The petition discussed in the post below — National Rifle Association , et al , v. City of Chicago , et al. — has now been docketed as 08-1497 .
It can be downloaded here .
It raises one question : “ Whether the right of the people to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is incorporated into the Due Process Clause or the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so as to be applicable to the staes , thereby invalidating ordinances prohibiting possession of handguns in the home . ”
( The post below was first published at 5:08 p.m. Wednesday . )

One day after losing a major test case in an appeals court on the scope of the Second Amendment , the National Rifle Association — the nation ’s leading advocate of personal gun rights — asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to apply the Amendment to state , county and city government laws that seek to regulate firearms .
The petition was announced by the NRA in this news release .
The petition will be posted as soon as it becomes available .
The NRA is challenging a ruling on Tuesday by the Seventh Circuit Court , saying it was bound by Supreme Court precedent to find that the Amendment restricts only federal laws , not those enacted by state and local government .
A post discussing the Circuit Court ruling can be read here .
A second petition , from other challengers to a Chicago gun ban , will be filed shortly , and no later than Monday , according to their attorney , Alan Gura , an Alexandria , Va. , attorney who argued and won the Second Amendment case at the Supreme Court last Term ( District of Columbia v. Heller , 07-290 ) .
The other challengers to the Circuit Court ruling are the Second Amendment Foundation , the Illinois State Rifle Association , and four Chicago residents .
The Supreme Court last June established an individual right , under the Amendment , to have a gun for self - defense in one ’s home .
The Court did not decide , however , whether the Amendment would now be applied to restrict state and local government moves to regulate or ban guns .
That will be the core argument in the new petitions .
The NRA , in its news release about its petition , indicated it would argue that the Seventh Circuit Court should have followed the Ninth Circuit Court in finding a way to “ incorporate ” Second Amendment rights , through the Fourteenth Amendment , so that those rights would then apply against states , counties and cities .
The protesters have gathered in a car park outside the refinery
Refinery strikes spread across UK Hundreds of striking workers have taken part in a third day of protests in North Lincolnshire over the use of foreign labour on a construction site .
Up to 1,000 people gathered at Lindsey Oil Refinery after a £ 200 m contract was given to an Italian firm .
Protesters vowed to return on Monday .
Unions said British staff should be doing the work .
Total , owners of the refinery at North Killingholme , said there would be " no direct redundancies " as a result .
Protesters carried posters calling for UK jobs to be given to British workers .
The protest was disrupted at 0615 GMT , when a car collided with an oil tanker at the entrance to the refinery .
Firefighters took about 30 minutes to free the driver of the car , who was then taken to hospital .
We are disappointed they have taken this action and we hope the situation will be resolved as soon as possible
Total statement
Once the protesters were assembled in a car park opposite the refinery they were addressed by union leaders .
Unite regional officer Bernard McAuley told them : " There is sufficient unemployed skilled labour wanting the right to work on that site and they are demanding the right to work on that site .
" Our general secretaries of Unite and the GMB have called upon the prime minister to call an urgent meeting with the heads of industry in the engineering and construction industry to clients and the trade unions to get round the table .
" We want fairness .
We want the rights of our members to have the opportunity to be employed , not just on this job but on all jobs around the United Kingdom . "
Protester Kenny
Ward told the crowd they had to stand together and take on the " greedy employer " .
He said : " This is what it 's about , it 's about collective strength .
I 'm a victim , you are a victim , there are thousands in this country that are victims to this discrimination , this victimisation of the British worker . "
Friday 's Lindsey refinery protest ended at about 1000 GMT .
The protest began on Wednesday with a walk - out by Lindsey workers and at least 800 people demonstrated at the plant on Thursday .
The action has now escalated , with workers walking out of sites across the UK .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
They included employees at BP 's Dimlington gas terminal in East Yorkshire and its chemical manufacturing plant in Saltend , Hull .
Lindsey 's Total bosses decided to invest in a new de-sulphurisation unit at the plant in 2004 , and a contract to complete the work was awarded to the Californian - based engineering group Jacobs in June 2006 .
When additional works were found to be needed a sub- contract was awarded to IREM over six other contractors , including five from the UK .
Cleethorpes MP
Shona McIsaac said the decision was " like a red rag to a bull for people in our community who are out of work and who have skills that could be used in this construction project " .
In a statement , Total said there would be no direct redundancies as a result of the contract .
" On this one specific occasion , IREM was selected , through a fair and competitive tender process , as the most appropriate company to complete this work .
" We will continue to put contracts out to tender in the future and we are confident we will award further contracts to UK companies .
" We are disappointed they have taken this action and we hope contractors return to work so the situation can be resolved as soon as possible through discussion with their union representatives . "
It said its main refining operations on the 500 - acre site remained unaffected by the action .

Pres. Obama does not want a “ truth commission ” looking into the Bush Administration ’s harsh interrogation of high - value enemy combatants .
People may think his flip - flop on having the Justice Dept. look into the matter is a cave to hysterical , Sullivan - esque self - soilers , but that is only half - accurate .
The point of fobbing this issue off on Holder & Co. is precisely to try to remove everyone else from the equation , including the media .
This was a common tactic of the Clinton Administration : “ Sorry , as you know , this matter is under investigation , so I am not at liberty to comment . ”
Sen. Majority Ldr. Harry Reid ( D - NV ) concurred with Obama , leaving House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) carrying the banner for a “ truth commission . ”
No doubt her constituents in San Francisco would favor it as well .
But privately , she — like most Democrats — probably recognize that it would not only distract them from their ginormous left - wing policy agenda , but also provoke a “ scorched earth ” resistance to that agenda from the GOP .
Indeed , the smarter ones likely realize that criminal charges against the lawyers who drafted the interrogation memos is exceedingly unlikely .
The case for pursuing war crimes charges is only marginally better .
The waterboarding that went on here is not the “ water cure ” administered by US soldiers in the Philippines , or the Asano war crimes case , both of which involved pouring water directly into the mouths and noses of subjects , which is considerably more harsh and dangerous .
The Democrats know as much as anyone that this issue already polls badly with likely voters .
Trying to pretend that the Bush Administration was like the Third Reich simply would not play with anyone less unhinged than the Andrew Sullivans of the world ( who would likely end up disappointed with the outcome ) .
If Congressional Democrats pursue this , it will most likely be with the expectation that the GOP would rise to prevent any sort of bipartisan effort , allowing the Dems to retreat , while blaming the GOP .
Finally , despite the feistiness of former VPOTUS Dick Cheney , the GOP would gain little from a “ truth commission . ”
Sure , it would be fun to expose the hypocrisy of the Congressional Democrats who knew and repeatedly approved the program .
But every day spent dwelling on the Bush Administration is a day not spent moving forward , which Republicans ought to want to do as much as Obama does .
The GOP is wildly unpopular ; wallowing in these show trials , even if cathartic to those who would get the chance to defend themselves , would simply play into the DNC strategy of painting the Republicans as mired in the past .
In short , a “ truth commission ” ultimately serves almost no one ’s political interest .
It is an idea pushed forward by the screeching rage of a vocal minority .
It will likely suffer the same fate as the AIG bonus taxes — once the story leaves the headlines , it will die in the shadows .

Update :
As an aside , the above link to the Asano case is a purported debunking of a claim made by Paul Begala .
Today , Begala claims he was not referring to the Asano case , but to the Tokyo Trials , officially known as the International Military Tribunal for the Far East .
The problem with that is that those cases are just as distinguishable , unless one assumes that dumping buckets of water through a towel , filling up the mouth and nostrils with water , is the same as pouring water on KSMs head wrapped in cellophane for less than a minute at a time .
Update x2 : Mark Hemingway responds to Begala , noting not only the difference between cellophane and a cloth towel as protection , but also that at the Tokyo Trials , only seven Japanese war criminals were executed , all of whom were convicted of either being complicit in or directly comitting atrocities and murder on a grand scale .

Super - intense lasers can boot bunches of electrons from the inner region of atoms , according to a new study .
This extension of the photoelectric effect , in which one photon knocks one electron off the edge of an atom , could make physicists reconsider when light is a wave and when it 's a particle .
" The photoelectric effect was the most famous effect to demonstrate that light can have particle character , " said Mathias Richter of the Physikalisch - Technische Bundesansalt in Berlin , and lead author of the study published Monday in Physical Review Letters .
" Now we come and say , even the photoelectric effect is better described in the wave picture of light if you apply these high intensities . "
Light has been caught kicking electrons out of atoms since the 1830s .
The photoelectric effect is responsible for early video cameras , digital cameras , solar cells , night vision goggles and Albert Einstein 's Nobel Prize in Physics .
Physicists expected the energy of the electrons would depend on the intensity of the light , or how much energy it transfers to a given area in a certain amount of time .
They were startled in 1902 when a German physicist showed that the electrons ' energy depended instead on the color ( or the frequency ) of the light .
Einstein solved the puzzle three years later by suggesting that light is both a wave and a particle at the same time .
Light particles – called photons – carry a packet of energy that depends on their frequency .
But Einstein did n’t do the experiment with extremely intense light .
In the original version of the photoelectric effect , one photon kicks out one electron , like one pool ball smacking into another .
The first electrons to go are the outermost ones , because the atom holds them less tightly .
In the new study , the physicists shot xenon atoms with FLASH , an x-ray laser that uses intense photons in the extreme ultraviolet energy range , about forty times the energy of visible light .
The xenon atoms lost a whopping 21 electrons at once , which indicates that it was hit by 50 photons simultaneously .
Not only that , but the first electrons to pop off were from an inner region of the atom , like if you peeled an onion starting with the second layer .
" What we normally do when we put an atom in one of these intense laser beams is we start stripping the electrons from the outside inward , " said Louis DiMauro , a physicist at The Ohio State University working on the Linac Coherent Light Source , a high - energy x-ray laser in California .
" If what they ’re saying is correct , which I believe it is , things like the light source are going to strip atoms from the inside out . "
Richter thinks that rather than acting like a billiard ball , the incoming photons acted like a wave .
" This is beyond describing it by individual photons , " he said .
" It would be better to think about the idea that these photons interact as a collective , that they act together like a good team . "
The bundle of light energy made the inner electrons shudder so violently they broke out of their atomic prisons .
Their flight left holes for outer electrons to fall into , and the energy they released in moving between layers freed still more electrons .
" This is a nice extension of Einstein ’s photoelectric effect , " Richter said .
" It ’s the photoelectric effect under so extreme conditions that it ’s better to describe it in the wave picture of light than the particle picture . "
" It ’s a pretty exciting result , " DiMauro said , though he cautioned that the idea needs to be tested more rigorously .
" I think their speculation has some legs to it , but these are the first type of experiments that have looked at this fundamental process .
There ’s a need for some more evidence . "

Someone important appears not to be telling the truth about her knowledge of the CIA 's use of enhanced interrogation techniques ( EITs ) .
That someone is Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi .
The political persecution of Bush administration officials she has been pushing may now ensnare her .
Here 's what we know .
On Sept. 4 , 2002 , less than a year after 9/11 , the CIA briefed Rep. Porter Goss , then House Intelligence Committee chairman , and Mrs. Pelosi , then the committee 's ranking Democrat , on EITs including waterboarding .
They were the first members of Congress to be informed .
In December 2007 , Mrs. Pelosi admitted that she attended the briefing , but she would n't comment for the record about precisely what she was told .
At the time the Washington Post spoke with a " congressional source familiar with Pelosi 's position on the matter " and summarized that person 's comments this way :
" The source said Pelosi recalls that techniques described by the CIA were still in the planning stage -- they had been designed and cleared with agency lawyers but not yet put in practice -- and acknowledged that Pelosi did not raise objections at the time . "
When questions were raised last month about these statements , Mrs. Pelosi insisted at a news conference that " We were not -- I repeat -- were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used . "
Mrs. Pelosi also claimed that the CIA " did not tell us they were using that , flat out .
And any , any contention to the contrary is simply not true . "
She had earlier said on TV , " I can say flat - out , they never told us that these enhanced interrogations were being used . "
The Obama administration 's CIA director , Leon Panetta , and Mr. Goss have both disputed Mrs. Pelosi 's account .
__1840 : __Britain starts using adhesive postage stamps , with the " penny black " stamp allowing prepayment of postage at a fixed — and low — rate .
The idea will stick .
King Henry
I of England started a system of royal messengers in the 12th century , and subsequent monarchs improved and expanded the service .
Henry VIII formally established the Royal Mail in 1516 , but it was not until 1635 that Charles I made the service available to the public .
It was possible to prepay postage , but mostly it was the recipient 's responsibility to pay the fees .
If the recipient refused to accept delivery , the Royal Mail could n't collect , and it lost plenty of revenue that way .
Railroads were spreading across Britain in the 1830s and ' 40s , which made a rapid national mail service both possible and , because of the increased commerce in goods , necessary .
A reformer named Rowland Hill started campaigning in 1837 for a cheap , pay - in - advance system that would make the mails available to everyone and help British commerce in the bargain .
He proposed the rate of one penny ( about 40 cents in current U.S. money ) .
Proof of payment would either be prepaid stationery or a label printed on " a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp , and covered at the back with a glutinous wash . "
In other words , an adhesive postage stamp .
Parliament passed a postal reform bill in 1839 , and Hill became an adviser to the Treasury , which supervised the financial operations of the Royal Mail .
A national contest to design the first stamps drew thousands of entries .
The ultimate design was the penny black stamp , good for use throughout Britain on May 6 of the following year .
The tuppence blue stamp , for letters weighing more than the standard half - ounce , debuted a few days later .
They both featured a portrait of Queen Victoria , then at the start of a six - decade reign .
All subsequent British stamps have shown the head of the reigning monarch , either as the main subject or as a smaller reverse or relief design .
The stamps came in sheets of 240 , corresponding to the number of pence in a pound sterling in the pre-1971 pound - shilling - pence currency system .
The Royal Mail replaced the penny black with penny red stamps in 1841 , largely because the black stamps were too easy to counterfeit , and the black ink hid postmarks , so people could — and did — reuse canceled stamps .
Postal customers had to cut the sheets with scissors or knives , because the Royal Mail did n't start issuing sheets with perforations until 1854 .
The stamps were an instant success .
Postal traffic doubled in the first year and quadrupled by 1850 .
The system was widely copied and spread to more than 150 countries by 1880 .
Some accounts say the idea , if not the reality , of adhesive postage stamps originated earlier in Austria , Sweden or maybe Greece .
But British stamps , to this day , are the only ones in the world that need not name the country of origin :
The monarch 's head suffices .

Last week both Democrats and Republicans in Congress floated housing proposals which say a lot about how politicians misunderstand our country ’s economic fundamentals .
Republicans in the Senate backed an amendment to the federal stimulus package that calls for a government - subsidized , four percent mortgage rate designed to spur home purchases and hence bolster falling prices , which Republican Senator Mitch McConnell described as “ the underlying cause of the recent downturn . ”
Although the proposal , lauded in some conservative circles , was defeated easily by the Democrats who control the Senate , the stimulus may well contain the Dem ’s version of housing incentive , namely boosting the current tax credit for those purchasing a new home to $ 15,000 .
Although somewhat different , both proposals reflect an underlying assumption common among politicians that housing drives the American economy and therefore must be supported by government intervention , an idea that is at best a distraction , but at worst a prescription for policy nightmares .
In good times , government looks for ways to sustain house buying even as prices rise , which often contributes to bubbles and foreclosure crises .
And in difficult times the “ support housing at all costs ” mentality produces bailout ideas that are costly and ineffective — not exactly the fundamentals of good government policy making .
Far from leading the way , the housing market often trails in an economic recovery .
In a recent paper , economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff looked at 18 major , recession - inducing financial crises around the world dating back to the Great Depression and found that typically housing is not the first but the last major indicator to recover in such sharp downturns .
On average , housing prices declined 35.5 percent in these crises and took six years to bounce back .
By contrast , gross domestic product snapped back in less than two years , followed by equity markets and unemployment .
The Great Depression , characterized not only by high unemployment and sharply contracting output , but by a massive housing foreclosure crisis , is a good example of how little impact massive government intervention has on housing during a downturn .
The housing market back then was ripe for a fall .
Production of new units had soared from about 250,000 a year in the early 1920s to 600,000 annually by the end of the decade .
Banks had more than doubled their outstanding mortgage debt in the 1920s , and within 10 years the number of households that owned their homes had increased a whopping 30 percent .
Soon after the stock market ’s crash in October of 1929 , the housing market began to collapse in a manner that recalls today ’s meltdown .
As panicked depositors withdrew their money from banks , lenders stopped making mortgages , and homeowners , who in those days typically had short - term mortgages which needed to be refinanced several times before they could be paid off , suddenly could n’t find new loans and started defaulting rapidly .
Lacking new financing , by 1933 some 1,000 homes a day nationwide were going into foreclosure .
State and federal government employed a variety of aid plans to bolster prices and stop the failures , including foreclosure moratoriums that largely proved to be ineffective because they did nothing to solve the system ’s fundamental problems .
The most important bailout effort was the Home Owners Loan Corporation ( HOLC ) , created in 1933 to buy troubled mortgages from banks and then allow homeowners to refinance these loans on more affordable terms with the government .
HOLC was supposed to free banks to lend again because it purchased their bad mortgages .
But although HOLC bought and refinanced about one million mortgages , total mortgage lending and production of new housing stayed absolutely flat for the rest of the decade because the country ’s underlying economic fundamentals were so poor that there was little demand for new home lending .
What ultimately revived the housing market was not HOLC ’s bad mortgage buying program but the nation ’s broader economic recovery after World War II .
The government ’s housing interventions are generally even more troubling during good times because they help create bubbles and new foreclosure problems .
After World War II , pent up housing demand sparked an explosion of new building and home buying .
During that time the federal government ’s G.I. bill provided returning soldiers with the opportunity to buy homes with mortgages subsidized by the Veterans Administration , while the Federal Housing Administration also backed loans to spur lending .
By 1949 , 40 percent of all new mortgages were government - backed .
But as the housing boom continued into the 1950s and prices started rising beyond the reach of a new generation of would - be homeowners , the federal government came under pressure to loosen its credit standards .
Washington began requiring smaller down payments , so that by the early 1960s government –subsidized loans for more than 90 percent of the value of a home were typical .
At the same time , the government loosened income ratios , that is , the ratio of a borrower ’s income to housing payments , and began stretching out the terms of loans to longer periods .
The looser standards provoked rising delinquency rates and loan failures .
The foreclosure rate on FHA loans spiked nearly five fold during the 1950s , while the failure rate on VA mortgages doubled .
By the early 1960s , FHA loans were four times more likely to default than conventional loans and VA mortgages were more than twice as likely to default .
In all , government - subsidized mortgages performed much worse during the recession of the early 1960s than did conventional mortgages , whose lenders had not reduced their underwriting standards .
This cycle has played itself out several times in the ensuing decades , to progressively more disastrous consequences .
But we ’re obviously not cured of our fascination with housing stimulus yet , even though it ’s clear that the economic fundamentals do n’t augur well for a current housing revival led by tax credits or interest rate cuts .
The Democrats ’ plan to provide home buyers with a generaous tax credit is more likely to be used by people who would be purchasing homes anyway , producing a steep hit on the Treasury without much additional buying .
And Harvard economist Ed Glaeser estimates that the Republican interest - rate plan would only result in enough new purchases to boost home prices by only about six percent , hardly enough to revive this a market .
But more important , as Glaeser notes , lenders have only recently ‘ recovered their sanity ’ after the mortgage lending sprees of the last few years , and the last thing we want government to do is encourage them to go on a new lender bender .
Now if only our politicians would recover their sanity when it comes to the nation ’s housing market .
Who 's Afraid of a ' Public Plan , ' and Why ?
Private Sector May Not Have as Much to Fear From a Public Plan as it Thinks
Why are private insurance companies and managed care organizations so frightened of a " public plan " ?
One controversial element of current ideas about health care reform is the proposal that a new public health insurance plan sponsored by the government should be created .
This new public plan would be an alternative source of insurance for people who cannot get health insurance through an employer - sponsored plan at work and cannot find an affordable option in the private , individual market , or as an additional option for employers seeking group coverage for their employees .
There remain many differing visions about what this public plan might look like and how it might be structured , but any such approach is the subject of some pretty heated debate .
Understanding a bit more about why this idea is controversial might be helpful as the conversation moves forward .
From literally the time of our nation 's founding , most Americans have been taught ( and genuinely seem to believe ) that the private sector can do almost anything more effectively and more efficiently than the government .
We acknowledge a few exceptions : national defense , international relations , some policing and public safety functions and basic education .
Even in those areas , the government role is often viewed as a grudging admission of necessity , rather than a clear expression of preference .
And whenever it seems to be an option , we pursue means of having these public functions accomplished though contracts with private entities .
In part , of course , some of our belief that private initiative is preferable to government action is historic , emotional and a matter of basic philosophy .
It reflects a view that government , even if it is democratically elected and subject to a wide range of checks and balances , is to be feared as a force that may reduce our liberty and perhaps our highly valued self - reliance .
This latter aspect is of special concern if government programs reach too deeply into too many areas of our daily lives .
Will Public Plan Really Be Competition ?
But most of our national aversion to government seems to be more a matter of practicality than philosophy .
We simply believe that government is not very good at most tasks .
That it is cumbersome , bureaucratic , slow to respond , quickly becomes entrenched and resists change even when the need to adapt is obvious to all .
Large programs like a state 's department of children and families , or federal agencies like FEMA are routinely cited as examples that affirm this view .
Nimble , effective private sector entities like Apple Computers , the BlackBerry folks or eBay exemplify the alternative .
In health care , the comparisons are between a slow , intrusive , bureaucratic Medicare or Veterans Administration program , as distinct from a well - managed private insurance company or an astoundingly effective provider like the Mayo Clinic or Geisinger .
And again the comparisons seem to affirm the superiority of the private sector alternative .
But all of this raises two pretty basic questions .
The first is a simple " why ? "
What is it that makes the private sector organization more efficient , responsive and effective ?
The answer is almost always that this is the natural and certain consequence of competition : Private entities simply must manifest these characteristics or they wo n't survive in the marketplace .
The second question is more intriguing .
If private companies are better at whatever might be the task at hand , mainly because they have already accrued the benefits of prior healthy competition , why would our nation 's private health insurance companies so desperately fear the presence of a public sector alternative as part of that very competition ?
Surely they would expect to be able to easily thrash such a public alternative in the marketplace .
After all , they have the head start of being better at doing this from the outset , they have the advantage of being more nimble and responsive going forward , and the public program , whatever its final form , will be disadvantaged by the inevitable ineptitude of government .
Private Companies May Have Little to Fear From Public Plan
So why on earth would the private companies be worried that the public program alternative might be able to even come close to achieving their standards ?
To be sure , if the same public program that competes with the private entities also gets to write and enforce the rules of the competition , that might create a problem .
But almost all serious observers anticipate that the public program alternative currently being proposed will not also control the regulatory framework in which services are offered ; it will simply be available as another option , and will survive only if it can succeed as a genuine alternative to those private companies .
Clearly , if the certain ineptitude of a public program and the obvious superiority of the private sector are true , there would be no reason for the latter to fear the former .
Given the passion of such fear in today 's health policy conversation , one cannot help but wonder what else might be going on here .
R. Paul Duncan , Ph.D. , is a Research Foundation Professor at the University of Florida , where he also Chairs the Department of Health Services Research , Management and Policy .
Much of Duncan 's research is focused on access to health care and issues surrounding health insurance coverage .
Thomas Kelly explains the foreclosure process to those outside the banking industry by likening it to a tube .
" You get put in the tube when you 're 90 days late , and you might come out the other end of the tube six months later , " said Kelly , spokesman for JPMorgan Chase & Co .
What Kelly 's analogy does n't explain is how , for the past three years , thousands more Phoenix - area property owners have been entering the tube each month than coming out of it .
At present , the system is backed up with more than 45,000 " pending " foreclosures , up from about 2,300 in June 2006 , according to a historical analysis by the Information Market , a Phoenix research firm .
Most experts expect pending foreclosures to increase even more before leveling off sometime within the next 12 months .
There has been much speculation among real - estate professionals about reasons for the apparent backlog of houses and condominiums headed toward foreclosure .
There 's a widespread belief that banks are purposely limiting the flow of foreclosure homes onto the market , which helps prevent home prices from sliding even further but could prolong the market 's long - term recovery .
Likewise , some say lenders are dragging their heels on repossessing and selling extravagant homes , and to a lesser extent commercial properties , including raw land , because the demand for big - ticket real estate is too low and because selling off large assets at sharply reduced prices could cause some smaller banks to fail .
Lenders have been relatively quiet about their strategies for working through pending foreclosures , which has only fueled various theories .
But Kelly said such theories give the banks too much credit .
" We 've got such an enormous portfolio of homes to deal with , we do n't have time to say , ' Let 's do this with this one , and let 's do that with that one , ' " he said .
Monthly foreclosure totals have risen and fallen a number of times since the housing market peaked in 2006 , although the general trend has been upward .
However , the number of pending foreclosures , properties on notice for a trustee sale but not yet sold , has increased steadily without exception since April 2006 .
In the past year , it has climbed by anywhere from 500 to 5,000 properties each month .
As of Friday , there were 45,709 total pending foreclosures in Maricopa County , according to the Information Market .
Those are in addition to the roughly 73,000 foreclosures completed during the past three years .
Also as of Friday , the county was on track to reach 5,000 foreclosures by the end of this month , which would be the second - highest monthly total on record , having reached a high of 5,240 in February .
Even if 5,000 properties complete the foreclosure process this month , an even greater number will enter it .
As of Friday , lenders had served pre-foreclosure notices on 5,700 additional properties , a net increase of at least 700 in pending transactions for the month .
Actual foreclosures in the past three years total about 73,000 , according to the data .
Some Valley foreclosures may be taking longer than the usual 91 days from notice to sale because the borrowers are attempting to work out a loan - modification or " short sale " agreement with the lender .
In Maricopa County , short sales have increased in the past year but still account for less than 5 percent of property sales .
Modifications help
Colleen Gunderson , Tempe - based Century 21 All Stars owner and designated broker , believes banks have intentionally slowed the release of foreclosure properties onto the market at the behest of the federal government , which provided many banks with bailout funds .
" There is a process in place to sort of warehouse these properties until a time when it 's more beneficial to place them on the market , " she said .
It 's the right approach , Gunderson added , because dumping 45,000 foreclosed - on properties onto the market all at once would deliver the knockout punch to a real - estate economy already leaning against the ropes .
New , standardized loan - modification guidelines issued by the Obama administration in March appear to be doing a better job of keeping some borrowers out of foreclosure than modifications made in 2008 , according to two federal bank regulators , but it 's still too early to know for sure .
More than half of loan modifications negotiated before the Treasury Department launched its $ 75 million Making Home Affordable program in early March were back in default within six months , according to a study conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
Those same officials said in May that the rate of re-default fell by about 12 percent among those borrowers whose monthly payments were reduced .
However , the number of loans headed toward foreclosure has risen significantly despite better modifications .
In March , the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University in Washington , D.C. , conducted a study of the nation 's roughly 8,000 banks with online - news service msnbc.com and reported finding a 150 percent increase in loans at risk of foreclosure compared with a year earlier .
Kelly said job losses are one likely reason for the continued high volume of foreclosures , in addition to people walking away from mortgages even though the payments are affordable because they owe far more than the home is worth .
Commercial is next
Although most Valley foreclosures thus far have involved residential property , commercial - property owners and lenders are preparing for apartment , office and retail foreclosures to rise sky - high in the coming months .
Selling those properties back to the market could take years in some cases , analysts said , because there is little interest in new office and retail space , even at the low - rent end .
Craig Henig of commerical real estate brokerage CB Richard Ellis in Phoenix said banks are n't in any rush to foreclose on commercial real estate because it forces the lender to adjust the property 's book value to today 's considerably lower market price .
Significant write - downs on a few multimillion - dollar commercial loans could put a small or financially stressed bank out of business , he said .
" I do n't know how they could sustain the amount of markdowns , " Henig said .
However , Kelly said the holding costs associated with thousands of foreclosed - on properties outweigh any benefit the bank might realize from waiting to sell them .
He also noted that the value of commercial real estate and high - end homes is still on the decline , which means waiting is likely to cost lenders even more .
" The goal is to get that asset back earning money for you , " he said .

Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich is upset that President Obama released Office of Legal Council memos that justified harsh interrogation tactics like waterboarding .
“ What we ’re seeing now in a very sad way is bitter , partisan attacks on the Bush people , as much as we ’ve seen since the McCarthy era .
The way they ’re putting specific people at risk for prosecution is unprecedented in the modern era , ” Gingrich told Fox ’s Chris Wallace .

A Pontiac which never got much love till the end of its life was the Fiero .
Burdened by the sluggish 2.5 - liter " Iron Duke " four - cylinder and suspension bits from the lowly Citation , the Fiero started off with lead weights around its neck .
By 1988 though , GM had seen the light and given it a proper suspension , eye - catching styling and improvements to both the four - cylinder and V6 .
It also gave the car the axe once it reached desirability .
Seems there are parallels between the Fiero and the Pontiac brand .
9 ) 1956 Pontiac Star Chief
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Pontiacs of old could be reliably counted on as the stylish , more sporting brother to their more staid Chevrolet counterparts .
The ' 56 Pontiac Star Chief lineup can be considered the pinnacle of the Chieftain line , with a selection of sedans , convertibles and wagons all bringing the heat with beautiful body work and powerful V8 engines .
8 ) 2002 Pontiac Trans Am WS6

The 2002 Pontiac Trans Am WS6 was the final F - Body muscle car to come out of Pontiac , with a 325 HP LS1 V8 , six speed manual and the last iteration of that famous " Ram Air " hood , it was a performance bargain at $ 28,000 .
The final year got the special yellow and black livery and if you 've got one , it just went up in value .
7 ) 1978 Pontiac Trans Am

If you were a boy growing up in the 70s or early 80s , the ' 78 Pontiac Trans
Am in the black and gold " Bandit " livery , complete with the flaming chicken vinyl on the hood , sat right next to the Lamborghini Countach in your fantasy garage .
For ' 78 , the compression was bumped in the top - line V8 and this end - of - malaise era automobile made a stout ( for the time ) 220 HP .
Burt Reynolds , along with that repressed little redneck inside all of us , will miss the ' 78 Trans Am .

The second generation GTO picked up right were the first generation left off , adopting a more modern fastback styling language and hugely powerful 400 cubic inch V8 's rated all the way up to 370 HP .
The Judge package was kinda hokey but also pretty cool , with wild color options , matching decals , spoilers , a Ram Air hood and a T - handle Hurst shifter .
Bring on the Judge .
5 ) Pontiac Bonneville

The Bonneville was Pontiac 's longest surviving nameplate , running from 1957 to 2005 when it mercifully got the axe .
As lackadaisical as the car had been for the last 20 or so years , there were some gems throughout its history .
The 1999 SSEi had woeful build quality , but when it held together the FWD 240 HP supercharged V6 was a hoot ( as was battling torque steer ) .
The monstrous ' 71 Bonnie wore a 455 cubic inch V8 and four barrel carb good for 325 HP and the ' 59 model wore outrageous quadruple fins .

GM tantalized us with the 2010 Pontiac G8 ST ahead of the 2008 New York Auto Show and our dreams of a modern , tire - smoking , truck - car , mullet - machine were so close to reality .
A year later GM squashed the G8 ST under the force of the Carpocalypse , and now Pontiac follows it to the grave .

The 1964 Pontiac GTO was little more than a hot - rodded LeMans , but the 325 HP , 389 cubic inch V8 with a Carter four - barrel carb , dual exhaust and a three - speed Hurst manual transmission ignited the original muscle car wars .
It lit a fire in Pontiac showrooms , selling three times the projected annual sales and it will always have a special place in every car guy 's heart .

Finally America had gotten it right — by importing a car from Australia .
The 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP had everything — raucous styling , a 415 HP 6.3 - liter V8 , six speed transmission and rear wheel drive .
Our own Wes Siler posited GM should be saved for no other reason than to put the G8 GXP on the road .
If you 've managed to get your hot little hands on one , hold onto it , like an artists painting , it 'll be worth much more once Pontiac is dead .

HONORABLE MENTION : Pontiac Aztek
Advertisement
We will miss the Aztek for two main reasons :
First it was a breath of fresh air in a then - burgeoning SUV market , with incredible functionality and great features , the Aztek pointed out how underfeatured many of the more expensive entries were .
Of course , that breath of fresh air was tainted by its fart of styling .
Not since the Edsel was a vehicle so universally panned for the stylistic abomination it was .
So the second reason we 'll miss it is because it was so easy to make fun of .
In many ways , that 's what the Pontiac brand 's been all about .
We 'll miss it .

TRENTON -- New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram is weighing in on a bill to legalize marijuana for medical use .
Milgram says the measure , which would allow patients suffering from cancer , multiple sclerosis and other serious diseases grow marijuana plants for medicinal use or buy the drug at a licensed outlet , is " workable . "
Under the bill , which has passed the Senate but has not been heard in the Assembly , eligible patients would register with the state .
Gov. Jon S. Corzine has said he would sign the bill .
Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Christie has said he would oppose it .
Former Bogota Mayor Steve Lonegan , also vying for the GOP gubernatorial nomination , has said he supports the measure .
While acknowledging that there are concerns about enforcing laws to ensure that only patients are allowed to grow and use the drug , Milgram said her office has sent recommendations to the governor on ways to guard against abuses .

The title given to this article is incorrect due to technical limitations .
The correct title is This article describes the preference .
To add , delete , or modify this preference , you will need to edit your configuration — doedit this article .
Background
This preference allows disabling of extension compatibility checking .
This is useful if you are using alpha , beta or nightly ( development ) builds which Add - on authors do not yet support .
However , enabling incompatible extensions may cause crashes or other malfunctions .
Note : Many extensions may have updated versions not on their main addons.mozilla.org page , so at the bottom of such extension 's pages use the link for " View All Versions " to see if there is an updated version available , or to be able to install an older or experimental version .
Note : In Mozilla applications based on Gecko 1.9.2 and above ( e.g. , Firefox 3.6 and SeaMonkey 2.1 ) this preference is no longer used and a new preference that includes the application version , extensions.checkCompatibility.< version > is used instead ( bug 521905 ) .
" < version > " includes alpha and beta milestones but excludes minor version updates .
It is the first few characters of the application version matching the following pattern : < number >.< number >< letter (s ) > . < letter (s ) > is cut off at a single letter in Firefox 3.6 ( 1.9.2 ) , it was fixed in bug 538234 .
For the most technical , the matching is made against the regular expression gBranchVersion defined in nsExtensionManager.js .
A few examples are in order :
Firefox 3.6b2 -> extensions.checkCompatibility.3.6b
Firefox 3.6 pre -> extensions.checkCompatibility .3.6 p ( the cut - off " pre " is due to bug 538234 . )
Update : bug 538234 was fixed 2010 - 01 - 08 .
For installing into app versions built after that date , use the full " pre " if present after the 2nd number .
( the cut - off " pre " is due to bug 538234 . )
Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.6.1 -> extensions.checkCompatibility.3.6
Firefox 3.7a1 -> extensions.checkCompatibility.3.7a
Firefox 4.0b2pre -> extensions.checkCompatibility.4.0b
Firefox Nightly >=7.0a1 * -> extensions.checkCompatibility.nightly ( bug 659048 )

( Default )
false
Do not check compatibility .
Incompatible add - ons will be marked in the Add - ons Manager - its icon will have an exclamation mark over it and when the add - on is selected , the text Not compatible with < application and version > appears below the extension description .
Caveats
This preference does not exist by default .
Installing an extension marked as incompatible with your application may cause your application to malfunction or crash .
Disabling extension compatibility checking may cause your application to malfunction or crash after a future upgrade .
If disabling extension compatibility checking makes your application crash on startup , you should try starting in Safe Mode and re-enabling compatibility checking .
UI
Mozilla Firefox 2.0 through 3.6
In versions since 2.0 and up through Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x , this preference can be toggled to true by clicking the " Enable " button in the Add - ons Manager next to the “ compatibility checking disabled ” alert .

I just received a very unusual , and refreshingly candid , message from a known scammer in Senegal .
It started with a standard introduction to a 419 scam early this morning .

Subject : You Owe Me Since you have n’t fallen for my stupid scam letter let me go ahead and be up front with you .
Because I am a Nigerian , you owe me something .
The fact that my decadent forefathers sold their neighbors and relatives into slavery means that you owe me a lot of money , especially if you are white .
I will accept $ 1000 USD from you per month for the next 12 months .
That will settle your debt towards me that was created by our forefathers .
Moreover , it is imperative that you begin to acknowledge my inherited right to steal and be corrupt without oppression from anybody ’s legal system .
I am entitled to instant riches at the expense of everyone outside West Africa .
This starts with you , my friend , so start paying up now by Western Union .
As much as I ’d like to think Jenifer had a nervous breakdown within the hour , it ’s clear that it ’s a different author .
The writing style is completely different and the scammer ’s from Senegal , not Nigeria .
I ’m guessing an angry recipient hacked her Yahoo !
Mail account and sent out the second message to discredit her .
Any other theories ?
I replied to the email to get more details , but I do n’t expect a response .
The owner of the Boston Globe has extended talks with unions to try to save one of America 's best - known big city newspapers from closure .
The owner , the New York Times , is asking Boston Globe staff to accept lower salaries and cuts in pension and redundancy benefits .
It has said it will file a notice with the government that it will shut the paper if there is no agreement .
The Boston Globe is expected to lose $ 85 m this year .
Online competition
The owners want the unions to agree to $ 20 m ( £ 13.4 m ) in money - saving measures .
Guaranteed jobs for life are expected to be a sticking point , with the unions saying they are not negotiable .
The biggest union , the Boston Newspaper Guild , said it had offered more than $ 10 m in concessions .
There was originally a Friday deadline for agreement , which was extended after some progress was made .
The Boston Globe is the latest title to find itself crushed between a variety of forces , including falling sales , rising costs and declining advertising revenues , the BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington says .
Our correspondent adds that the internet is the source of most of the American newspaper industry 's problems : demand from readers forces them to publish information online instantly and consumers are then reluctant to pay to see the same news in print the following day .
At the same time , internet sites offer cheap - and sometimes free - competition for the classified advertising which once kept the industry going .
With no new business model in sight to resolve those problems it seems inevitable that more titles will close in future , our correspondent says .
At least 12,500 jobs have gone in US print journalism in the past two years .
Introduction
A Concerned Christian
I am trying my best to continually improve and refine this site based on the feedback I receive from other Christians , especially those involved in group leadership .
Please see the site updates section for more information .
Focus on the Family 's " The Truth Project " is a DVD series taught by Dr. Del Tackett of the Focus on the Family Institute .
The series is pitched to churches throughout the nation and presented through small groups led by " facilitators , " folks officially trained at Focus on the Family Regional Training Conferences .
The program is a slick , media - rich presentation of the Christian worldview according to Dr. Tackett and others at Focus on the Family , including their views on philosophy , science , and sociology .
It pushes a strong bifurcation between " the true worldview " and " the false worldviews , " arguing both that there is a crisp division between the two and that the program represents the former side impeccably .
It is claimed that the views of Dr. Tackett and his associates represent reality , while those who disagree subscribe to " pernicious lies . "
This is the teaser trailer for The Truth Project : Looks pretty cool , right ?
Many participants
I 've talked to have emerged from the series excited and feeling educated .
Unfortunately , The Truth Project is problematic in two critical ways .
First , it is problematic with regard to intrachristian issues .
Several of the philosophies and doctrines promoted by The Truth Project -- at the expense of others -- are in alignment with some Christian traditions .
But the program packages them in language that suggests that these philosophies and doctrines are universally accepted as " essential Christianity . "
This overlooks the fact that other legitimate Christian traditions hold different positions , inhibiting open and critical examination of these disputed issues .
It is an attempt at Christian unity by way of unjust exclusion ( 1 Cor 3:4-10 ) .
Second , it is problematic with regard to factual information .
In the series , many different beliefs about science , doctrine and philosophy are attacked .
Unfortunately , they are also misrepresented ; the attacks are upon " straw men . "
Opposing views should always be fairly and accurately represented , not only because it is wrong to give false testimony ( Exod 20:16 ) , but also because the believer 's faith will suffer when he later discovers the actual truth ( Matt 18:6 ) .
Site Purpose Last year I participated in a Truth Project group and emerged discouraged .
Dr. Tackett made many false claims about many things , all in the name of absolute truth .
And the bifurcative nature of the program made these lies even more frustrating .
My Christian brethren were being misled , and I subsequently saw more and more churches incorporate The Truth Project into their ministries .
I built this web site with a Christ - centered , truth - centered intent .
It is my first attempt at reaching churches , pastors and laypeople whose foundation for their faith may have been inadvertently weakened by The Truth Project .
In propagating untruths , Dr. Tackett and Focus on the Family , in this case , have provided Christians with foundations of sand , and I 'm genuinely worried about its effects on American Christianity in particular .
Now , do n't get me wrong -- much of The Truth Project is moderately valuable for Christians .
But there are many factual blunders taught in the program as well , and those blunders are used as premises for later claims , devaluing them .
Those who susbcribe to all of the program 's claims will find themselves with a worldview based partially on false teachings .
Like Dr. Tackett , I do not have a degree in any of theology , philosophy , natural science , etc. Dr. Tackett 's degree is in management , and mine is in software engineering .
But even as someone who is limited to personal study and conference with folks more knowledgeable than I am , I feel that this DVD series is demonstrably misleading in many of the points it makes .
Site Overview
This site contains five sections .
Two are " Fact Check " sections .
In them , I rebut several false claims made by Dr. Tackett in the program .
Although there are non sequiturs and bad implications in several of the Tours , most of the demonstrably untrue teachings can be found in Tours 2 and 5 .
These two sections should be enough to sufficiently concern those interested in The Truth Project .
Even if you come to the same conclusions as Dr. Tackett in the end , you should agree that the deceptive means by which he arrives at those conclusions are irresponsible and dangerous .
The other three sections are essays that confront some of the overarching , worldview - defining cases made by the program .
These " Other Christian Viewpoints " sections are less cut - and - dry than the " Fact Check " sections ; the intent is merely to cogently present some legitimate Christian viewpoints that Dr. Tackett brazenly calls anti-Christian .
I pray that , after reading the material on this site , you 'll agree that The Truth Project both is unreliable in much of the information it presents and needlessly attacks some genuinely Christian views , and is thus not a good fit for your church or small group .
If , however , your church or small group is already invested in the series , you might consider compiling lists of errata so that group leaders can correct the program 's mistakes in a cool and casual manner .
You can leave feedback at my e-mail account for this site : The TruthProblem @ gmail.com
I 'm interested both in constructive criticism and in encouragement !
( c ) 2009 The Truth Problem .
The moment the new water laws hit Monday , it 's like the LA Department of Water & Power went bonkers with water conservation ideas .
Today is a new door hanger program , in which the the hangers were given to the public via their print newspaper subscriptions .
" LADWP door hangers are designed to help customers encourage their neighbors not to waste water and to avoid fines associated with violations of the City ’s Water Conservation Ordinance , " they explain .
" On one side of the door hanger is a list of four common wasteful water practices , with a checkbox for each prohibited use .
Neighbors , when they spot water being wasted on a neighbor ’s property , can select the box or boxes that apply and leave the hanger anonymously on the neighbor ’s door . "
Those four common wasteful practices are : excess water flowing over pavement and into gutters during irrigation or car washing , sprinklers are on more than twice a week , sprinklers are on during the day , broken or leaky sprinkler .
You can also obtain them at any of the 14 LADWP Customer Service Centers .

In addition to this , there has been a cultural shift away from the smaller engine hatchback to large SUVs and vans .
Not only is the gas price rising , but the size of the engine is also getting larger , creating a cycle that sees much higher gas and running costs .
Make sure that all the doors of the cars are locked :
Your valuables which you think safe inside the hire cars may disappear in your absence .
So , in order to avoid all these things to happen and keep your belongings safe , you must ensure that doors of the cars are locked .
Before leaving your vehicle locked at the parking lots or other places make sure that nobody is there inside the car and you have switched off the air conditioner .
Car rental Insurances :
It is the most profitable part of the car hire which can make you benefited providing compensation in case of collision of rental cars if that causes serious damages to the vehicle , any person or property of the persons , lives of the passengers and drivers .
But , your choicest rental car must cover the insurance policies that exempt the renters in the above cases .
Parking at the dim - lit areas pose dangers to the hire cars .
The vehicle positioned at the isolated places may receive scratches or dents , some parts of it may get stolen .
So , renters must choose bright - lit areas for their hire cars , in case they fail to park it inside the parking lot due to lack of enough space .
Mixed reviews :
Was the star back on top of his game – or pushing himself to the edge ?
It should have been the opportunity of a lifetime for a Michael Jackson fan : a behind - the - scenes invitation to a rehearsal for the superstar ’s upcoming concert tour in the United Kingdom .
But when the fan got to the stage , she was horrified .
“ He is a skeleton , ” she wrote Monday in an email to other Jackson fans .
Worse , she said , was seeing her idol surrounded by people she deemed too frightened to say anything .
“ I have to say : He may die . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Three days later , Jackson , 50 , collapsed in his rented Holmby Hills mansion – with his personal physician on the premises .
His heart stopped ; he was n’t breathing .
An ambulance raced him to a hospital just minutes away from his house , but despite another hour of frantic resuscitation efforts , the world had lost one of the most successful artists in music history .
The Los Angeles County Coroner will conduct an autopsy , with some results expected as early as Friday , although the findings of other possible tests could take longer .
Some in the entertainment world are utterly shocked at the sudden demise of seasoned entertainer who was , by all accounts , focused on one thing alone : getting ready for a series of 10 comeback shows at London ’s 02 Arena set to launch next month .
Jackson rehearsed at the Staples Center on June 24 in Los Angeles , the day before with “ great energy , ” Grammy executive producer Ken Ehrlich tells PEOPLE .
“ He was n’t giving it full out .
But vocally he had started to really project .
I thought he was in great form , ” who was at the rehearsal .
Jackson had even signed on The Incredible Hulk ‘s Lou Ferrigno as his personal trainer , although the two had n’t worked out together in two weeks .
Yet while many in the entertainment world expressed sadness and shock , a different , more unsettling reaction came from several people close to Jackson and his family , who describe Jackson as unavoidably thin and fragile .
Filmmaker Bryan Michael Stoller , who visited Jackson in April , was shocked by his weight loss .
“ I hugged him and it was like hugging bones , ” he tells PEOPLE .
“ After seeing him , I never thought he would complete the tour . ”
Says Dr. Firpo Carr , a friend and confidante of Jackson ’s , “ I sensed something was wrong and , quite honestly , I was n’t terribly surprised when I got the news .
I would get word from people in his camp that things were n’t quite right . ”
A source close to the singer who did n’t want to be identified adds : “ Michael has n’t been feeling well .
All last week he ’d stopped coming out of his house to see his fans .
He was doing that every day . ”
As part of his preparations for the high - stakes UK concert tour , Jackson had been training – hard .
He has put in 10 - hour rehearsals , a witness says , for the sort of stage spectacle fans had come to expect .
Promoters insisted the 50 - year - old entertainer was physically ready for the rigors of a full tour .
But there was concern among some in his inner circle that Jackson might push too hard : “ They did n’t want him to overtax himself , ” family friend Kevin McLin tells PEOPLE .
“ You look back in history , he never completed all the dates of his shows because he gave so much in each performance – he would go non -stop for two hours . ”
And on Thursday , even before UCLA doctors declared Jackson dead , family attorney Brian Oxman , who huddled with the grieving family at the hospital , raised the specter of possible abuse of drugs prescribed for the singer ’s long history of physical ailments .
“ If you think that the case of Anna Nicole Smith was an abuse , it is nothing in comparison to what we have seen in Michael Jackson ’s life , ” Oxman told CNN .
According to the fan at Jackson ’s rehearsal who tried to raise the alarm among those who adored him , the combination of risk factors seemed dangerously close to claiming its victim .
“ We all love Michael really much .
We all want to see his shows .
We all think about how we will be [ in the ] first row , ” the fan wrote earlier in the week .
“ How will you do all of these things if during the third concert he faints on stage , and if his heart stops during his way to the hospital ?
How will you feel when you will talk with other fans and will say :
We knew he was too skinny to perform ? ”
Somehow , the settlements are again the most burning and problematic issue in the Middle East .
The Netanyahu - Obama meeting reintroduced this matter .
As if this is the problem around here .
As if the entire mess stems from the settlements .
As if all we need to do is to remove Migron or Kalgaron for quiet to prevail .
If only we evacuate another settlement unilaterally , life in the Middle East will change for the better .
Give and Take Yesha heads , Barak meet on settlement construction Efrat Weiss West Bank settlement representatives call meeting with defense minister to discuss freeze in settlements construction , ' quiet expulsion ' of residents .
Barak : Illegal outposts hurting Israel , undermining settlement movement Yesha heads , Barak meet on settlement construction
And so what if history proves otherwise .
So what if the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza led to more bloodshed and by now has enabled Hamas , at any given moment , to place tens of thousands of Israelis under the threat of Qassam rockets .
I am not a member of the Greater Israel camp .
I assume , with some regret , that one of these days we shall have to renounce this vision , and I ’m hopeful that the settlement blocs that remain in our hands will comprise as many Jews as possible .
Yet according to all indications , that day , where we shall reach an agreement with someone on the other side , is so distant that it is completely unclear why this issue has become so urgent at this time .
After all , it has been proven already that even when Israel evacuates settlements nothing happens , and it was also proven that when an Israeli prime minister offers the Palestinians a withdrawal from 98 % of the territory , including east Jerusalem , there is nobody on the other side that would sign such deal .
It is clear to all of us that even if there is someone out there who decides to sign , Hamas will not feel bound by the agreement and will continue to fight us , under more convenient circumstances .
For a long time now I ’ve wanted to build a house in my community , located in Gush Etzion .
It is n’t an isolated settlement or a controversial community .
Even according to the leading leftists , I live in a settlement bloc that will be annexed to Jerusalem in the future .
Even within the framework of the Geneva Accord , the one signed by Beilin ( strange that we ’ve seen wars around here since then , ) our community is on the Israeli side .
No permits
Yet despite all of this , there is almost no construction in my community .
There is plenty of space , under Israeli ownership , yet there are no construction permits .
Every apartment that becomes available here draws dozens of interested buyers , prices are going up , and a new house here has become something that only people with quite a bit of money can afford .
It is important to note that quite a few people want to buy a house in Gush Etzion for reasons that have nothing to do with ideological motives .
For a religious family , there is something very appropriate about
this way of life : A religious community , religious education , synagogues , proper companionship , and great proximity to Jerusalem .
Not that there is anything wrong with people who have a political agenda , yet this is not the reason why so many people wish to build a house here .
This is the farthest thing from building a new settlement .
We are talking about children who got married and wish to live near their parents .
There is no shortage of space for new homes .
The only thing missing is the defense minister ’s signature .

The soldiers came at 1:30 a.m , rousing family members who were sleeping on the roof to escape the late - summer heat .
They broke down the front door .
Accompanied by dogs , American and Iraqi troops burst into the Jassam family home in the town of Mahmoudiya south of Baghdad .
“ Where is the journalist Ibrahim ? ” one of the Iraqi soldiers barked at the grandparents , children and grandchildren as they staggered blearily down the stairs .
Ibrahim Jassam , a cameraman and photographer for the Reuters news agency , stepped forward , one of this brothers recalled .
“ Take me if you want me , but please leave my brothers . ”
The soldiers rifled through the house , confiscating his computer hard drive and cameras .
And then they led him away , handcuffed and blindfolded .
Advertisement
That was Sept. 2 .
Jassam , 31 , has been in U.S. custody ever since .
His case is the latest of a dozen detentions the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists has documented since 2001 .
No formal accusations have been made against Jassam , and an Iraqi court ordered in November that he be released for lack of evidence .
But the U.S. military continues to hold him , saying it has intelligence that he is “ a high security threat , ” said Maj .
Neal Fisher , spokesman for detainee affairs .
The Obama administration harshly criticized Iran for its imprisonment of Roxana Saberi , the U.S. - Iranian journalist who was convicted of espionage and sentenced to eight years in prison before being freed two weeks ago .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Iran ’s treatment of Saberi as “ non-transparent , unpredictable and arbitrary . ”

Washington also has called upon North Korea to expedite the trial of two U.S. journalists being held on spying charges .
Yet the U.S. has routinely used the arbitrary powers it assumed after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorism attacks to hold journalists without charge in Iraq , as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan , the Committee to Protect Journalists said .
None of the detained journalists has been convicted of any charge , undermining the United States ’ reputation when it comes to criticizing other countries on issues of press freedom , committee executive director Joel Simon said .
“ The U.S. has a record of holding journalists for long periods of time without due process and without explanation , ” he said .
“ Its standing would be improved if it addressed this issue . ”

Reuters has expressed disappointment over Jassam ’s detention and has said there is no evidence against him .
Sami Haj , a cameraman for the TV network Al Jazeera , was detained by Pakistani authorities as he tried to cross into Afghanistan in 2001 to cover the offensive against the Taliban .
He was turned over to the U.S. military , which held him for six years at the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
He was accused him of being a courier for militant Islamic organizations , but was never charged .
He was released a year ago .
In Iraq , Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein was held for two years without trial before being released in April 2008 on the orders of an Iraqi judge under the terms of an amnesty law .
The U.S. military maintained that Hussein had links to insurgents , but the AP said the allegations were based on nothing more than the Pulitzer Prize - winning photographs of insurgents that he had taken on the streets of Ramadi , in western Iraq .
Jassam is the only Iraqi journalist still in U.S. custody , the last to be detained under wartime rules that predated a U.S. - Iraqi security agreement signed in December .
Under the new accord , U.S. forces must obtain a warrant before they can arrest an Iraqi citizen .
Advertisement
Jassam was detained without a warrant “ as the result of his activity with a known insurgent organization , ” Fisher said .
No evidence against Jassam was presented at his court hearing in November , Fisher said , because the military intelligence against him had not yet been verified .
Under the wartime rules in place at the time , he said , “ there was no requirement to link the military intelligence with rule of law type of evidentiary procedures . ”
After the court ordered Jassam ’s release , Fisher said , new evidence came to light that suggested he was a “ high security threat . ”
Advertisement
The CPJ ’s Simon said it was possible for someone to use the cover of journalism to conduct other activities .
“ No one is suggesting that journalists should have a get - out - of - jail - free card , ” he said .
“ But if you accuse someone of something there needs to be a fair legal process .
That ’s what we said in the Roxana Saberi case , and that ’s what we say in the Ibrahim Jassam case . ”
Jassam will have to wait for the requirements of the security pact to play out before he gets another day in court or his freedom .
The agreement states that the U.S. is to release low - threat detainees in a “ safe and orderly ” way and refer “ high threat ” cases to the Iraqi Justice Ministry for review .
The decision to release him or transfer him to the Iraqi legal system will be made by the Iraqi government .
The only timetable for that step is “ by the end of the year , ” Fisher said .
By that time , Jassam will have been in custody for more than a year .
Advertisement
Jassam ’s brother , Walid , visited him recently in Camp Bucca , the desolate , tented U.S. prison camp in the desert in southern Iraq , and found him close to the breaking point .
“ He used to be handsome , but now he ’s pale and he ’s tired , ” said Walid , who says his brother had no ties to insurgents .
“ Every now and then while we were talking , he would start crying .
He was begging me : ‘ Please do something to get me out of here .
I do n’t know what is the charge against me . ’
“ I told him we already tried everything . ”

Are Debit Cards the Future ?
A couple days ago , I got some pushback for arguing that the credit industry 's tiered model amounted to a subsidization scheme : Credit card users who fall into debt get socked with fees and interest rates that in turn subsidize reward programs and low APRs for the credit users with a steadier cash flow .
And , admittedly , my argument was largely speculative .
But over at Felix Salmon 's blog , some credit industry insiders add to the point .
One writes :
In the recent past , I worked as a management consultant for some major credit card issuers .
I can tell you that internally , these companies have a common term for customers who pay off their entire balance every month : “ freeloaders ” .
These “ freeloaders ” are n’t necessarily unprofitable ; some are , most are n’t , on average the group is mildly profitable , but not nearly as profitable as those who carry a balance .
If you ’re wondering how a “ freeloading ” customer can be unprofitable , there are several factors .
For one , about 0.8 % of the 2 % - 3 % interchange fee goes to rewards , but a diligent customer can push that to 1.5 % or more by optimizing the collection and redemption of rewards points .
Beyond that , the credit card issuer finances everything the “ freeloader ” buys on the card for 15 to 45 days .
Finally , there are the various expenses a customer costs : printing and mailing cards and statements , call center service , various card benefits , etc . [...]
There are tradeoffs for everything .
If hotels were banned from charging $ 8 for a minibar beer and $ 2 / minute for phone calls and $ 25 for breakfast , the hotel chains would have to reevaluate their pricing structure .
The result would probably be higher room rates and some closed hotels .
If airlines had a price limit put on their business class seats , you can bet coach tickets would go up in price and the number of flights would go down .
In these cases and in the case of credit cards , there is tremendous profitability in one customer segment that , to an extent , essentially subsidizes another segment because it is willing to pay ridiculous prices .
The difference is that with airlines and hotels , the people paying the ridiculous prices are corporations and rich people , while in credit cards , it ’s the stupid and the poor .
Another said :
I have worked for five years in the credit card industry for two major issuers , actually running and developing the financial models ( NPV etc ) on which the decisions were made to solicit and approve consumers ... I have been intimately involved in decisions to lend more than $ 100B to US consumers through credit card .
So , I am talking form reality here , not conjectures .
Credit card industry works on a bar - bell business model .
All the profits ( mainly through fees and very very high interest stretching into 30 % or more ) are made form people below 650 FICO , all the assets ( loans or balances ) are from people from above 700 FICO .
The industry is just a giant wealth transfer mechanism from poor people to wealthly people .
The profits from below ( subprime ) serve to subsidize the interest rate and rewards cost of people in the ’ super prime ’ category .
Both of Salmon 's correspondents say the same thing :
The credit card industry is n't lying .
The new rules passed by the Congress mean the end of a business model based around the failures of irresponsible card holders .
That means credit card companies will have to flatten out their structure and make slightly more off the " good " cardholder who have been getting something of an easy ride in recent years .
But it 's not clear how far they can go with that .
It used to be that a credit card offered two things : Credit , with all its benefits and dangers , and convenience .
But with debit cards , you can now have the convenience of plastic without the temptations of credit .
I , for instance , use a debit card exclusively .
And so do many others .
On May 1st , Visa made headlines by saying that transactions made on Visa - branded debit cards had exceeded transactions made on Visa - branded credit cards .
If credit card holders with good credit are suddenly exposed to higher interest rates and less favorable terms -- if the dangers of credit , in other words , enlarge -- the changeover to debit will probably accelerate .

Apple ’s Safari 4 browser is a pig .
It ’s a resource hog that does n’t clean up after itself — and it remembers every site you visit , even in “ porn mode . ”
Safari records every site you visit , even if you turn on the “ Private Browsing ” feature or clear the browser history .
And the files it generates can consume gigabytes of disk space .
“ This is a huge privacy concern , ” writes designer and musician C. Harwick , from Chapel Hill , NC , who did some snooping in Safari ’s hidden system folders .
“ With no good way of getting rid of them except manually ( clearing the history does n’t do it , and I do n’t think resetting Safari does either ) , these hidden files are strewn all over the user ’s hard drive unbeknownst to him waiting for snooping relatives ( or more pertinently , law enforcement ) to dig them up .
I really like Safari , but I ’m going to have to seriously consider using Firefox now ( ack ) . ”
But the worst offender was the Quicklook folder , a Finder feature that gives a sneak peek of unopened files .
Safari ’s Quicklook folder included thumbnails of all the sites Hardwick had ever visited with the browser — and had grown to a whopping 2GB .
“ Safari does not delete the webpage previews it generates for Quicklook .
Ever. 2.03 GB of webpage previews ( 2 per website – a full resolution and a thumbnail ) , all generated since downloading the Safari 4 beta — hidden away in an obscure folder , ” Harwick wrote .
According to MacOSXTips.com , to disable the “ Top Sites ” feature , fire up Terminal , and type the following command :
defaults write com.apple .Safari DebugSafari4IncludeTopSites - bool FALSE

Bill Waters may have solved a mystery that ’s “ baffled generations of sweet - toothed Americans , ” said Guy Adams in Britain ’s The Independent .
Waters , a rare - manuscripts collector , found what appears to be an early handwritten recipe for Dr Pepper , in a battered ledger in a Shamrock , Texas , antique store .
The yellowing recipe for “ D Peppers Pepsin Bitter , ” calling for mandrake root and other odd ingredients , goes up for auction next week .
The claims that this is an early Dr Pepper recipe are “ all wet , ” said Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an open letter via PR Newswire .
Dr Pepper ’s 23 ingredients are a secret known only to three company employees , and you ’ll be “ ‘ bitterly ’ disappointed ” if you expect “ wahoo bark , bitter orange peel , and mandrake root ” to yield anything like Dr Pepper .
Neither Waters nor the auction house has actually tried to “ mix up a batch , ” said the AP ’s Jamie Stengle in Yahoo !
Finance .
But even without a taste test , Waters ’ $ 200 find will still probably fetch between $ 50,000 and $ 70,000 .
Even Dr Pepper agrees that the recipe is authentic — the question is , what does it make ?
How have Canadians managed to make a go of multiculturalism when it ’s in trouble almost everywhere else ?
* Haroon Siddiqui * on the reasons to cheer ( and what bothers Muslims most about the country ) .
ILLUSTRATION : Stephen Munday / www.threeinabox.com
Multiculturalism is being trashed in Europe .
My Canadian view of that is :
a ) Europeans are abandoning what they never had ; if , by multiculturalism , we mean the official recognition and promotion of the equality and dignity of all groups and cultures , rather than a feel - good policy which celebrates urban cosmopolitan exotica but camouflages the domination of majority mores on minorities – politically , economically , culturally and socially , and :
b ) Multiculturalism , long a lightning rod for nativists against immigrants , is the smokescreen Islamophobes use to demonize Muslim minorities and Islam .
Canada has not been immune from Muslim - bashing or some of the excesses of the war on terror .
But being the world ’s only constitutionally multicultural country , it has withstood such attacks well .
Advert
All the familiar , facile charges against multiculturalism – that it allows importation of unacceptable alien practices ; erodes common values ; encourages ethnic ghettoes , dual loyalties and fifth columnists ; compromises national security ; increases political correctness and constrains free speech ; blurs the distinction between church and state , by permitting increasing religiosity in the public square ; etcetera , etcetera – have been wrestled to the ground more successfully in Canada than in Europe .
As Canada ’s leading expert on multiculturalism , Will Kymlicka , professor of philosophy at Queen ’s University , has written : ‘ Too often these debates have been initiated by right - wing commentators as thinly disguised strategies for attacking immigrants , particularly Muslims , accompanied by apocalyptic predictions about how Canada ’s experiment in multiculturalism is on the verge of collapse . ’
It is n’t .
On the contrary , it has emerged stronger , as we shall see .
Unlike Europe but like the US , Canada considers itself an immigrant nation , in need of immigrants ( current intake : 250,000 a year , on a population of 33 million ) .
Given that more than 60 per cent of our skilled labour requirements are being filled by the foreign - born , Canadians recognize that we invite immigrants because we need them , not because we want to do them a favour ( that , we could say , we do with refugees , about 15,000 a year ) .
Respect for difference
Unlike the US , Canada never did separate church and state , and it also recognized group rights .
The 1867 British North America Act ( BNA ) , the defining document of the Canadian dominion , codified specific rights for our Aboriginal peoples , and also English - speaking British Protestants and French - speaking Catholics – on the basis of race , religion and language .
The DNA of BNA being diversity , its natural outgrowth was the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ( Section 27 : ‘ This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians ’ ) , and the 1988 Multiculturalism Act ( ‘ Multiculturalism reflects the cultural and racial diversity of Canadian society and acknowledges the freedom of all members of Canadian society to preserve , enhance and share their cultural heritage ’ ) .
Canada has since developed considerable case law on what constitutes ‘ reasonable accommodation ’ between the majority and minorities .
Even more significantly , multiculturalism has nudged Canadians of long - established ancestry into making the difficult psychological journey towards accepting all Canadians as equal .
Advert
The debate over ‘ Who ’s a Canadian ’ or , more controversially in secessionist Quebec , ‘ Who ’s a Quebecois ’ has long been resolved .
A Canadian is one who lives legally in Canada , and a Quebecker is a Canadian who resides in that province , period .
There are no second - class citizens .
A minority of Canadians have found this hard to swallow .
Periodically , some float such hare - brained ideas as ‘ a social contract ’ between ‘ the host society ’ and ‘ the newcomers ’ , setting out some ill - defined ‘ limits ’ on this or that immigrant religious / cultural behaviour .
But we already have a social contract : the rule of law .
That and that alone is our common holy parchment .
There can be no arbitrary limits set by self - appointed busybodies on what minorities or new Canadians can or cannot do .
How far can respect for difference go ?
As far as the law allows and no further .
This is not a negative assertion .
Rather , it is one of the core constitutional values of modern Canada : the strong shall not dictate to the weak on what is , or is not , acceptable .
The power to define citizen conduct rests only with the people ’s parliaments – federally , provincially and municipally .
As Canadian as ...
Canadians generally recognize that :
• Immigrants cannot be expected to develop amnesia the moment they land in Canada .
The nation is the richer for their imported memories , ideas and cultures , so long as these do not violate the law .
• Immigrants have always congregated with their own kind , in so - called ‘ ethnic ghettoes ’ , where they find help in the initial settlement process , thereby reducing the burden on the state .
• In an immigrant nation , tensions are inevitable between the native - born and the foreign - born , older and newer immigrants , and the ancestral practices of immigrant parents and their Canadian - born or - bred kids .
The push - pull of ‘ old country ’ values and new is the alchemy of a living , breathing culture , as opposed to an ossified one .
National identity is constantly evolving , as each generation feels free to redefine the country and does , for the better .
• The best tool of integration is a job commensurate with one ’s skills .
Employers who discriminate on the basis of race or religion should be prosecuted .
There is no forced nationalism / patriotism .
A national competition on CBC - Radio , asking listeners to finish the phrase ‘ As Canadian as ...’ , produced this winning entry : ‘ As Canadian as possible under the circumstances . ’
Despite that , or because of it , some of the most moving tributes on Canada Day rallies come from new Canadians .
The proportion of immigrants who become citizens is higher in Canada than anywhere else , as also the proportion of members of Parliament who are foreign - born .
No racist , anti-immigrant party can hope to win a national election .
The Canadian approach to Quebec separatism is instructive as well .
Joe Clark , Conservative Prime Minister for a brief period ( 1979 ) , used to say that the best way to deal with Quebec was to resist the temptation to define the relationship ; better keep it vague .
That wisdom found its way in to the Clarity Act ( 1999 ) , which says that Quebeckers have a perfect democratic right to separate , so long as they vote in a referendum on a clear question and approve it with a clear majority , left undefined , to be argued as and when the occasion arises .
In the meantime , separatists can and do contest national elections , winning a sizeable bloc of seats in Parliament where they passionately argue against Canada – and get paid for doing so .
Polls show that Quebec separatism is now at its lowest in 40 years .
Righting wrongs
None of this is to pretend that Canada has been free of controversy over multiculturalism – far from it .
Rather , it is to assert that the pendulum does often swing back to the moderate middle , even in this era of tough security provisions at the expense of civil rights .
Canada alone among Western nations established a judicial commission to probe a post - 9/11 tragedy , the torture of Ottawa software engineer Maher Arar in a Syrian jail .
He was passing through New York airport in the fall of 2001 when American officials , after consulting their Canadian counterparts , put him on a secret CIA flight to Damascus , where he was held for 374 days .
The commission exposed Canadian and US complicity in his ‘ extra- rendition ’ and torture .
Ottawa was forced to offer him an official apology and Canadian $ 10 million ( about US $ 7.75 million ) in compensation .
Similarly , a former Supreme Court of Canada judge , appointed to inquire into the plight of three other Arab Canadians who allegedly suffered the same fate as Arar , found that they were indeed tortured in Syria and Egypt , with Canadian complicity , albeit indirect .
These cases solidified the principle that naturalized Canadians are as entitled to the full protection of the law and vigorous Canadian diplomatic representation as native - born Canadians .
Similarly , Islamophobic rhetoric , much in evidence in several public policy debates , has been exposed for what is : bigotry that could not be allowed to drive decision - making .
There was the highly charged 2005 - 06 debate in Ontario , Canada ’s largest province , about the possible introduction of so - called sharia law .
It was pointed out that no sharia law could possibly have come to Canada , even if some of its proponents foolishly thought so and its critics gleefully echoed them .
Rather , the crux of the matter was Ontario ’s 1991 Arbitration
Act – specifically , whether it applied equally to all religions .
Since Christians and Jews had been practising religiously informed arbitration in business disputes and such family matters as divorce and the distribution of marital assets , why not Muslims ?
It could not be credibly argued that Muslim women faced any more pressures to conform than women of other faiths .
The Ontario government , therefore , had no choice but either to allow such arbitration for all faith groups or to allow none at all .
It opted for the latter .
Those hoping to penalize Muslims alone were defeated .
Hijab hysteria
Then there was the 2007 - 08 ‘ reasonable accommodation ’ debate in Quebec which was anything but .
The municipal council of the town of Herouxville passed a code of conduct for immigrants – thou shall not stone women to death or circumcise them , nor wear the hijab or carry the kirpan in public , nor expect employers to provide a place or time off for prayers .
The popular press was in a tizzy over incidents involving Orthodox Jews and Muslims .
A downtown Montreal yeshiva ( traditional Jewish school ) had got the next - door YMCA to agree to tint its windows , so as not to tempt the young students to gawk at women exercising in tights .
Some public swimming pools were setting aside women - only hours for Muslims .
Montreal Jewish General Hospital had ejected an ambulance driver from its cafeteria for eating a ham sandwich .
So on and so forth .
This prompted the establishment of a commission , co-chaired by eminent academics Gérard Bouchard and McGill University professor Charles Taylor , Canada ’s pre-eminent philosopher and an architect of our multiculturalism policy .
After months of public hearings , the commission tabled a bluntly - worded report .
Calm down , it told Quebeckers , there was no crisis .
Minorities were not making unreasonable demands .
‘ Trivial incidents ’ had been blown out of proportion , mostly by the sensationalist media .
The commission laid down some general rules : ‘ the responsibility for integration is the responsibility of all , ’ not just immigrants .
‘ The desire for sameness is authoritarian . ’
‘ The right to freedom of religion includes the right to show it . ’
The display of religion in public spaces , in fact , advances the common good , by compelling all citizens to ‘ get to know those of the Other rather than deny or marginalize them ’ .
The hijab is fine in schools and elsewhere , as are the kippa , turban and kirpan ; none violates anyone else ’s rights .
Opposition to the hijab , from both right - wingers and leftist feminists , is ‘ often irrational ’ .
The hounding of hijabis ‘ should cease ’ ; a democracy could no more proscribe the hijab than ban a nun ’s habit , or a cardinal ’s skull cap or , for that matter , a bikini .
Universities and schools should offer temporary space for prayers , while permanent spaces may be needed at ‘ penitentiaries , hospitals or airports , since those there are not free to visit a church ’ .
Requests for non-Christian religious holidays are legitimate .
However , the duty of accommodation is not limitless .
‘ A request may be rejected if it leads to what the jurists call “ undue hardship ” , which can take different forms such as unreasonable cost , upsetting an organization ’s operation , infringing the rights of others , or prejudicing the maintenance of security and public order . ’
But , overall , the guiding principle should be : the more accommodation the better .
Otherwise , ‘ the rejection of certain requests risks producing the effect dreaded , that is , encouraging certain individuals to withdraw from public institutions and cease to interact with the common culture . ’
Sound Canadian principles , all .
The commission ’s report fell on receptive ears , and the so - called crisis disappeared almost overnight .
The moral of the story was that a liberal society must confront bigots , not cower to them .
As for the much - derided Muslims ( 580,000 in the 2001 census , but now estimated at 750,000 ) – they are a satisfied lot , according to a poll done for the Trudeau Foundation in Montreal .
They register higher levels of pride in Canada than the population at large .
They are less likely than Muslims in Britain , France , Germany or Spain to feel that their fellow citizens are hostile to Islam .
They did cite discrimination as a problem , but ‘ the thing Muslims least like about Canada is the cold weather ’ , just like all other immigrant groups .
If the weather is the top complaint of new Canadians , they and the nation must be doing just fine , thank you .
Vive le Canada .

Swine flu has made this a busy week for virus hunter Nathan Wolfe , who spoke at TED2009 about preventing the next pandemic .
His groundbreaking Global Viral Forecasting Initiative ( supported by grants from Google.org , the Skoll Foundation and others ) monitors people in close contact with animals ( such as subsistence hunters in central Africa ) to catch new diseases before they spread .
We caught up with Wolfe yesterday by phone , before his appearance on CNN with Anderson Cooper ( who plays a cameo role in Wolfe ’s TEDTalk ) , and asked him about this latest outbreak .
SARS , avian flu , swine flu … what ’s going on here ?
Why are we suddenly seeing so many more outbreaks of viruses from animals ?
Viruses have always passed from humans to animals .
In fact , the vast majority of human diseases have animal origins .
But the human population is different from what it once was .
For most of our history , we lived in geographically disparate populations .
So viruses could enter from animals into humans , spread locally and go extinct .
But the human population has gone through a connectivity explosion .
All humans on the planet are now connected to each other spatially and temporally in a way that ’s unprecedented in the history of vertebrate biology .
Humans — as well as our domestic animals and wild animals we trade — move around the planet at biological warp speed .
This provides new opportunities for viruses that would have gone extinct locally to have the population density fuel they need to establish themselves and spread globally .
We ’ve created a “ perfect storm ” for viruses .
And we ’ll continue to see — as we have in the past few years — a whole range of new animal diseases as outbreaks in human populations .
But we have to stop being surprised by them .
Right now , global public health is like cardiology in the ’ 50s — just waiting for the heart attack , without understanding why they occur or the many ways to monitor for them , detect them early and ultimately prevent them .
Swine flu is not an anomaly .
We know that swine flu — like the vast majority of new outbreaks — comes from animals .
We should be monitoring those animals and the humans that come into contact with them , so we can catch these viruses early , before they infect major cities and spread throughout the world .
Can we stop swine flu ?
Or is it too late ?
If you catch one of these outbreaks early on , there may be the potential to do what we call containment , where you limit the outbreak to a particular site .
But the reality is :
By the time swine flu got on the radar screen of global public health , it had already spread .
It was already in the States , it was in Mexico , it was in New Zealand .
By the time it reaches that point , you ’ve lost the ability to contain it .
There are ways to decrease the spread of the pandemic , but by that point , it ca n’t be contained .
( Editor ’s note : See Larry Brilliant ’s 2006 TEDTalk for more on the importance of early containment . )
The more fundamental question is :
How do we prevent these pandemics from occurring ?
There are commonalities among all the pandemics that occur , and we can learn from them .
One commonality is that they all come from animals .
And the other commonality is that we wait too long .
At the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative , our approach is to take it a step back .
If we can contain and monitor animal viruses at an earlier stage — when they ’re first entering human populations , preferably before they ’ve had a chance to become human - adapted , certainly before they ’ve had a chance to spread — we can head off pandemics altogether .
Swine flu may or may not end up being an important human pandemic .
But it ’s a perfect illustration of the need for a paradigm shift in the way we approach global disease control .
In your TEDTalk , you lay out plans for monitoring humans who have close contact with animals in African jungles and Asian “ wet markets . ”
Should you be monitoring pig farms as well ?
Absolutely .
What we do is all of the above .
We monitor people with contact with wild animals as well as domestic animals .
Chickens , ducks , pigs , monkeys … wherever people have contact with animals , that ’s where we want to be , so we can catch potential pandemics at the moment that they ’re born .
The good news is :
For a variety of reasons , the percentage of the human population that ’s in direct contact with animals is decreasing .
So that gives us the potential to put a substantive percentage of that population into regular monitoring .
Maybe we wo n’t catch everything , but we can create a much more substantive safety net for capturing these things before they go international or global .

Wolfe talks about why swine flu victims are dying in Mexico but not yet in the US ; how swine flu is a “ cosmopolitan virus ” ; and more … Your Global Viral Forecasting Initiative is expanding worldwide , but mainly in Asia and Africa .
If you were in Mexico , how might things have gone differently ?
In this case , we would have hoped to catch and contain swine flu when there were just dozens — instead of hundreds or thousands — of cases in Mexico , and before it spread globally .
GVFI ’s objective is to monitor the portal of entry for new diseases into human populations — that means looking at the point at which humans and animals interface .
We work with people who have high exposure to animals throughout the world , whether that means exposure to domestic animals — as with farm workers — or wild animals , as with people who hunt bushmeat in Africa or people who work in live animal markets in Asia .
The minute we see new viruses that are entering into humans , we make this information available for the public health community , so we can develop drugs and diagnostics and potentially vaccines based on them .
When we see new diseases spreading in local communities , we monitor them very closely .
If we were working in Mexico — and we were doing our jobs correctly — we would have caught this thing , perhaps in rural villages , before it made it to a site like Mexico City , and before it went international .
How do we understand the difference between the cases reported in Mexico , where many have died , and those in the US , which seem very mild ?
There is a striking anomoly between what appears to be a very low rate of mortality and illness among the American cases and what appears , on the surface , to be a higher rate of illness among the Mexican cases .
It could , of course , be the result of a difference in the viruses , although that does n’t necessarily appear to be the case .
It could be a difference in host populations , although again , that ’s difficult to explain .
One possibility is that because we ’ve looked more carefully for cases in the States , we ’re more likely to see individuals who are mildly ill .
We might find that if we looked more comprehensively in Mexico , we ’d see the same number of people who were very ill — because they ’re easy to find — and a much larger number of people who were mildly ill .
That would reduce the actual rate of mortality to a much lower number , and that may be more compatible with what we would see if the number increased in the American epidemic .
As the number of cases climb worldwide , many people are comparing this swine flu outbreak to the 1918 flu pandemic .
Is that an apt comparison ?
Well , they both represent novel introductions of influenza into human populations that were capable of spreading substantively .
The 1918 flu was notable in the sense that it spread comprehensively , globally , and it had a very high rate of mortality — affecting not only the very old or very young ( who have weak immune systems ) but also people in the prime of their lives , who are overcome by their body ’s own immune response .
Whether or not this happens with swine flu remains to be seen .
Initially , it does not appear to have the level of deadliness that the 1918 flu had .
I love bacon .
Am I at risk ?
Go ahead and have that BLT .
It ’s not a problem .
You ca n’t get swine flu from eating pork .
You ’d have to have close contact with a living , breathing , infected pig to get this virus — or rather , in order to have contracted the original pig virus .
The interesting and important thing about this “ pig flu ” is that it ’s now spreading from human to human .
It ’s become a human virus .
So people should take the usual precautions : Stay away from individuals who are sick .
Wash your hands frequently .
And the less you touch your face , nose and eyes , the better .
Take us back a step or two :
How did swine flu enter into the human population ?
Swine flu has been known since at least the early part of the 20th century , since the 1930s .
It was originally a virus of bird origin — all influenza viruses were originally bird viruses — and it probably spread to humans before it was in pigs .
Now , we still have n’t received definitive information on the underlying genetics of this particular virus .
But initial reports suggest that it may be what ’s known as a “ mosaic virus , ” which includes components of swine influenzas , bird influenzas and human influenzas .
A cosmopolitan virus like that would n’t be unprecedented .
( Editor ’s Note : see Joe DeRisi ’s 2006 TEDTalk for more on state - of - the - art virus detection . )
But in any case , this is a virus that appears to come from pigs , and pigs in close proximity spread the flu in much the same way that humans do — coughing , sneezing , and so on .
The virus probably initially entered into human populations through people who work with livestock .
Is swine flu here to stay ?
Whether this particular virus will sustain itself and become a permanent part of the human landscape is unclear , but that ’s certainly what we ’re watching for .
As it is , the virus may just disappear because of the weather ; summers are n’t good for flu viruses .
So this heat wave is working in our favor ?
It might be .
The virus has had a good start , from the flu perspective , considering that this is really the end of the season .
But the unseasonably hot weather may bode poorly for this virus ’ potential to establish itself definitively and cause a pandemic .
Had this happened in September or October , it would be much more concerning .
Having said that , it ’s not impossible that a virus like this might “ go into hiding ” — in the southern hemisphere or the tropics — and might come to light again next year .
So there will be a lot of discussion about expanding the fall flu vaccine to try to control it next cycle .
Is it really possible for us to prevent future outbreaks like this ?
Yes , I believe it is .
We spend tons of money trying to predict complex phenomena like tsunamis , hurricanes , earthquakes .
There ’s no reason to believe that a pandemic is harder to predict than a tsunami .
And we’d be foolish not to include forecasting and prevention as part of our overall portfolio to fight these pandemics .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The more often Americans go to church , the more likely they are to support the torture of suspected terrorists , according to a new survey .
The Washington Region Religious Campaign Against Torture rallied on Capitol Hill in March 2008 .
More than half of people who attend services at least once a week -- 54 percent -- said the use of torture against suspected terrorists is " often " or " sometimes " justified .
Only 42 percent of people who " seldom or never " go to services agreed , according to the analysis released Wednesday by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .
White evangelical Protestants were the religious group most likely to say torture is often or sometimes justified -- more than six in 10 supported it .
People unaffiliated with any religious organization were least likely to back it .
Only four in 10 of them did .
The analysis is based on a Pew Research Center survey of 742 American adults conducted April 14 - 21 .
It did not include analysis of groups other than white evangelicals , white non-Hispanic Catholics , white mainline Protestants and the religiously unaffiliated , because the sample size was too small .
See results of the survey »
The president of the National Association of Evangelicals , Leith Anderson , did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
The survey asked : " Do you think the use of torture against suspected terrorists in order to gain important information can often be justified , sometimes be justified , rarely be justified , or never be justified ? "
Roughly half of all respondents -- 49 percent -- said it is often or sometimes justified .
A quarter said it never is .
The religious group most likely to say torture is never justified was Protestant denominations -- such as Episcopalians , Lutherans and Presbyterians -- categorized as " mainline " Protestants , in contrast to evangelicals .
Just over three in 10 of them said torture is never justified .
A quarter of the religiously unaffiliated said the same , compared with two in 10 white non-Hispanic Catholics and one in eight evangelicals .

THE case of Baby P , a toddler tortured and killed by his supposed carers , shocked Britain after the conviction last year of his mother , her lover and a lodger .
The grim tale now turns out to have a horrible coda .
On May 1st verdicts were returned in the trial of the mother and her boyfriend for the rape of a two - year - old .
The mother was acquitted of cruelty — the victim told police she had seen the rape , and failed to intervene .
The boyfriend was convicted and may get a life sentence .
The case made legal history .
The child , aged three at the time of the trial and cross - examined via video link , was the youngest ever to give evidence in a British court .
Also unusual was the decision to use false names for the defendants , and to ban all reporting until after the verdict .
The fear was that the defendants would not be tried fairly if the jury made the connection with Baby P—or Peter , as he can now be called after his father asked for him to be dignified with his name .
In reaction to public outrage at the failure of social services to protect Baby Peter , Ed Balls , the secretary of state for children , schools and families , commissioned a review of child protection from Lord Laming , who had done a similar job after the murder in 2000 of Victoria Climbié by her guardians .
On May 6th Mr Balls published his response to Lord Laming 's findings .
Among the mostly sensible proposals were some intended to mitigate the consequences of that earlier review .
It had concluded that failures of communication had been the main problem : Victoria had been seen by many professionals , including doctors and social workers , none of whom had realised that she was already an object of concern .
But the electronic form Lord Laming 's first review spawned , which must be filled in whenever a child is referred to social services , has turned out to be an obstacle , not an aid .
The form , and the database on which cases are logged , are now to be trimmed .
And directors of the sprawling new children 's - services departments created for all those professionals intended to work together must , if they are inexperienced in child - protection work , find a deputy who knows all about it .
( Most directors are ex-teachers . )
But for all the talk of cross-agency communication , the most egregious recent failings in child protection have been by social workers .
Peter and Victoria were both on the “ at risk ” register and seen regularly .
Separately , social services in Doncaster are being investigated after seven children on their register died in the space of three years .
And on May 6th a leaked report from the UK Border Agency suggested that 77 children who had arrived unaccompanied from China had gone missing from a single care home since 2006 .
They are thought to be have been victims of child trafficking .
Only four have been found , two working as prostitutes .
A revamp of social - work degree courses , more on - the - job training and an advertising campaign to lure qualified social workers back to the front - line : none of Mr Balls 's plans is bad .
But they will hardly resuscitate a profession in crisis .
Each failing leads to further vilification : the Sun , a tabloid newspaper , campaigned to get everyone who had ever interacted with Baby Peter sacked .
Nationally , 13 % of child - protection posts are vacant ; in Haringey , where both Victoria and Peter died , the figure is 35 % .
Average pay for social workers is £ 28,000 a year ; for teachers , it is £ 34,000 — and Mr Balls confirmed there are no plans to close the gap .
A survey by Unison , a public - sector union , in January found that two - thirds of social workers were looking for other jobs .
( CNN ) --
At the 1964 New York World 's Fair , people stood in line for hours to look at a strange sight .
If only the future looked like " Star Trek , " with its nifty gadgets that seem to solve every problem .
They wanted to see the " Futurama , " a miniaturized replica of a typical 21st century American city that featured moving sidewalks , computer - guided cars zipping along congestion - free highways and resort hotels beneath the sea .
Forty years later , we 're still waiting for those congestion - free highways -- along with the jet pack , the paperless office and all those " Star Trek " - like gadgets that were supposed to make 21st - century life so easy .
Daniel Wilson has been waiting as well .
He 's looked at the future we imagined for ourselves in pulp comic books , old science magazines and cheesy sci-fi movies from the 1950s , and came up with one question .
Why is n't the future what it used to be ?
" I feel entitled to have all this technology that 's been promised at a certain time , " says Wilson , author of " Where 's My Jetpack ? "
" I look up and say , ' Where 's all this stuff ? ' ''
Some of that futuristic stuff , it turns out , is already here .
Visionaries actually invented objects like flying cars , but they could never work out the real world applications , Wilson says .
Other inventions had the same problem .
Ordinary people did n't want to have anything to do with them .
These futuristic follies include everything from " Smell - O - Vision , " an invention that helped moviegoers smell as well as see movies ; Sanyo's " ultrasonic ultra - squeaky clean human washing machine " ( it was dubbed the " human washing machine , " but would n't fit in an ordinary bathroom ) and , of course , the jet pack .
" Scientists are OK at predicting what technology is going to happen in the future , " Wilson says .
" They 're really bad at predicting how it 's going to affect us . "
What happened to my jet pack ?
The jet pack is a perfect example of predicting the future , Wilson says .
He says the jet pack first appeared in 1928 in an Amazing Stories comic book , which featured the hero Buck Rogers zooming though the sky in a jet pack .
The jet pack was actually developed by 1961 , Wilson says .
An inventor mounted a rocket onto a backpack and called it a rocket belt .
A variation of the rocket belt even appeared in the 1965 James Bond movie , " Thunderball . "
Today , the jet pack continues to grab inventors ' imaginations .
A daredevil wearing a jet pack flew across a 1,500 - foot - wide canyon in Colorado in November .
A Swiss pilot , dubbed " Fusion Man , " flew across the English Channel last year using a single jet - propelled wing .
And a New Zealand inventor recently invented a jet pack , which weighs about 250 pounds , that reportedly can run for 30 minutes .
The jet pack , though , has never really taken off , Wilson says .
The problem is its practical application .
While a rocket belt could propel a screaming human to 60 mph in seconds , its fuel lasted for only about half a minute , " which led to more screaming , " Wilson says .
The military could n't find a useful application for it either .
A soldier with a jet pack might look cool , but he 's an easy target .
Nor could a jet pack be of use to ordinary people who wanted to avoid rush - hour traffic , Wilson says .
Jet - packing hordes could transform the skies into an aerial demolition derby , with air rage and drunk drivers turned into wobbly human torpedoes .
Yet other bold visions of the future have come true .
Remember Rosey the Robot ?
That was the name of the robotic maid that waited on the Jetsons , the popular cartoon family from the future .
Rosey has become " Wakamaru . "
That 's the name of a 3 - foot - tall robot with a goofy grin that the Mitsubishi conglomerate in Japan invented to assist elderly people at home by doing everything from reminding them to take their medicine to looking out for burglars .
Wakamaru can recognize faces and up to 10,000 words , Wilson says .
" Beam me Up Scotty , " is a tagline from another television show , " Star Trek " .
But teleportation has been invented , Wilson says .
He says a group of international scientists successfully transported a photon -- a bundle of electromagnetic energy -- from one side of a room to another in 1993 .
Physicists routinely conduct teleportation experiments today , Wilson says .
" Teleporting anything , even elementary particles , is mind - blowing , " Wilson says .
" Why is it that most people do n't know it exists ?
It has n't been put into practice yet .
In real life , it 's always about , ' What can you do for me ? ' "
A darker view of technology 's future
People 's fascination with technology 's imprint on the future did n't start , however , in the mid-20th century with shows like " The Jetsons " or " Star Trek . "
Joseph Corn , co-author of " Yesterday 's Tomorrows : Past Visions of the American Future , " found an inflated optimism about technology 's impact on the future as far back as the 19th century , when writers like Jules Verne ( " Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea " ) were creating wondrous versions of the future .
Even then , people had a misplaced faith in the power of inventions to make life easier , Corn says .
For example , the typical 19th - century American city was crowded and smelly .
The problem was horses .
They created traffic jams , filled the streets with their droppings and , when they died , their carcasses .
But around the turn of the 20th century , Americans were predicting that another miraculous invention would deliver them from the burden of the horse and hurried urban life -- the automobile , Corn says .
" There were a lot of predictions associated with early automobiles , " Corn says .
" They would help eliminate congestion in the city and the messy , unsanitary streets of the city . "
Corn says Americans ' faith in the power of technology to reshape the future is due in part to their history .
Americans have never accepted a radical political transformation that would change their future .
They prefer technology , not radical politics , to propel social change .
" Technology has been seen by many Americans as a way to get a better tomorrow without having to deal with revolutionary change , " Corn says .
Today , however , a more sober view of technology has sneaked into the nation 's popular culture .
In dystopian sci -fi films like " Blade Runner , " and " Terminator , " technology creates more problems than it solves .
" Battlestar Galactica , '' the recent television series , is a prime example .
It depicts a world where human beings have created amazing technology that has brought them to the precipice of extinction .
There 's no Buck Rogers zooming blissfully through the sky .
The show follows the journey of a group of humans who created a race of robots called Cylons .
The Cylons rebel , virtually wipe out humanity with nuclear weapons , and pursue the survivors through space .
Mark Verheiden , a Battlestar writer , says the show 's writers pay attention to current events when plotting their story lines .
The contemporary world is filled with the unintended consequences of technology , he says .
" There are so many things you can't anticipate when you create a new technology , " he says .
" Who would have predicted that the Internet would be taking down shopping malls and wiping out newspapers ? ''
In Battlestar 's finale , human beings abandon their faith in technology 's ability to improve the future .
They destroy their fancy machines and start again as simple hunter - gatherers .
" At some point , you can't expect a miracle to come in the form of technology to save us , " Verheiden says .
" At some point , the miracle has to come from a change in attitude and a new outlook . "
That does n't mean , however , that Verheiden is n't a fan of imagining future technology .
He says he grew up watching " Star Trek " and immersing himself in Futurama - like exhibits .
The elevated cities and the " Star Trek " voyages of yesteryear may now seem corny , but at least they show humanity has a future , he says .
" ' Star Trek ' was saying [ that ] a thousand years from now , people [ will ] figure out how to get along , " Verheiden says .
" In some ways , sci - fi says that the future is still optimistic , because no matter how bleak things are , it suggests that we 're still here . "

Finally
directly
The Court should deny the Application .
The fees sought by Evercore are staggering : Evercore seeks $ 400,000 ( assuming the sale closes in one month ) in addition to the $ 46 million paid prepetition and in addition to an extraordinarily large success fee of $ 17.9 million ( which includes the Government Funded Sale Fee , DIP Structuring Fee , and the Delphi Fee ) .
This compensation request is all the more incredible in light of the fact that the Debtors are also retaining a Crisis Manager , which is asking for its own success bonus .
Not only does the scope of services of these two professionals have some apparent overlap , but it is impossible to justify these inordinately large bonuses under the circumstances of these cases .
This was not the circumstance where the financial advisor was left to search for a buyer and through its own unique and extraordinary efforts identified a white knight to save the company and the jobs of the Debtors ’ employees .
On the contrary , Evercore had no success at finding a purchaser or funder for the Debtors .
In light of these facts , the Evercore Application clearly exceeds the bounds of reasonableness .
Because the Debtors have not , and cannot , justify the fee structure and bonuses for Evercore the application cannot be approved .

The money shot from the US Trustee 's objection below :
A fundamental but elusive step in the early evolution of life on Earth has been replicated in a laboratory .
Researchers synthesized the basic ingredients of RNA , a molecule from which the simplest self - replicating structures are made .
Until now , they could n't explain how these ingredients might have formed .
" It 's like molecular choreography , where the molecules choreograph their own behavior , " said organic chemist John Sutherland of the University of Manchester , co-author of a study in Nature Wednesday .
RNA is now found in living cells , where it carries information between genes and protein - manufacturing cellular components .
Scientists think RNA existed early in Earth 's history , providing a necessary intermediate platform between pre-biotic chemicals and DNA , its double - stranded , more - stable descendant .
However , though researchers have been able to show how RNA 's component molecules , called ribonucleotides , could assemble into RNA , their many attempts to synthesize these ribonucleotides have failed .
No matter how they combined the ingredients — a sugar , a phosphate , and one of four different nitrogenous molecules , or nucleobases — ribonucleotides just would n't form .
Sutherland 's team took a different approach in what Harvard molecular biologist Jack Szostak called a " synthetic tour de force " in an accompanying commentary in Nature .
" By changing the way we mix the ingredients together , we managed to make ribonucleotides , " said Sutherland .
" The chemistry works very effectively from simple precursors , and the conditions required are not distinct from what one might imagine took place on the early Earth . "
Like other would - be nucleotide synthesizers , Sutherland 's team included phosphate in their mix , but rather than adding it to sugars and nucleobases , they started with an array of even simpler molecules that were probably also in Earth 's primordial ooze .
They mixed the molecules in water , heated the solution , then allowed it to evaporate , leaving behind a residue of hybrid , half - sugar , half - nucleobase molecules .
To this residue they again added water , heated it , allowed it evaporate , and then irradiated it .
At each stage of the cycle , the resulting molecules were more complex .
At the final stage , Sutherland 's team added phosphate .
" Remarkably , it transformed into the ribonucleotide ! " said Sutherland .
According to Sutherland , these laboratory conditions resembled those of the life - originating " warm little pond " hypothesized by Charles Darwin if the pond " evaporated , got heated , and then it rained and the sun shone . "
Such conditions are plausible , and Szostak imagined the ongoing cycle of evaporation , heating and condensation providing " a kind of organic snow which could accumulate as a reservoir of material ready for the next step in RNA synthesis . "
Intriguingly , the precursor molecules used by Sutherland 's team have been identified in interstellar dust clouds and on meteorites .
" Ribonucleotides are simply an expression of the fundamental principles of organic chemistry , " said Sutherland .
" They 're doing it unwittingly .
The instructions for them to do it are inherent in the structure of the precursor materials .
And if they can self - assemble so easily , perhaps they should n't be viewed as complicated . "

( New York ) - Iran should immediately free seven detained Baha 'i community leaders , or bring them promptly to trial so they can defend themselves in fair and open proceedings against the serious charges against them , Human Rights Watch said today .
Today is the one - year anniversary of the detention of six of them , while the seventh was detained earlier .
None have had access to a lawyer .
The seven men and women have been charged with spying for Israel , " insulting religious sanctities , " and spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic .
In addition , prison officials at Evin prison in Tehran informed relatives visiting the detained men and women last week that they would also be charged with " spreading corruption on Earth " ( mofsede fel arz ) , said Diane Ala'i , the Baha'i International Community 's representative to the UN in Geneva .
This offense is punishable by death under Iran 's Penal Code .
" These Baha 'i leaders have been languishing in prison for a year now , with no access to their lawyers and no glimmer of a trial date , " said Joe Stork , deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
" These reported new charges only add to the fears for their lives under a government that systematically discriminates against Bahai's . "
As with other religious communities throughout Iran , Baha 'i observance is grounded in local community organizations .
On May 14 , 2008 , six leaders of the national organization of Bahai's - a group that operates in the absence of the normal Baha 'i practice of having a National Spiritual Assembly - were arrested at their homes in Tehran .
They are : Fariba Kamalabadi ; Jamaloddin Khanjani ; Afif Naeimi ; Saeid Rezaie ; Behrouz Tavakkoli ; and Vahid Tizfahm .
A seventh , Mahvash Sabet , the secretary of the national community organization , was arrested on May 5 , 2008 , in Mashhad , northeast Iran , after responding to a summons from the Ministry of Intelligence .
The Baha'i faith is a monotheistic religion founded by Baha'ullah in 19th - century Iran and has approximately 300,000 followers in Iran .
The Iranian government considers Baha 'is to be apostates from Islam .
Today , Baha 'is face discrimination in their pursuit of higher education and many areas of employment .
In addition , the inclusion of Israel as a " holy place " in the Baha 'i faith in 1868 has , since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979 , been used to fuel persistent accusations against Baha 'is in Iran of spying for Israel , with which Iran has hostile relations .

Investments worth £ 800bn are made through Islamic finance products .
Experts in Islamic finance believe their way of doing business has shielded them from the global credit crisis .
But how does it differ from conventional Western finance ?
A former executive director of the International Monetary Fund , Dr Abbas Mirakhor , says wider Islamic economics relies on God 's guidance , handed down almost 1,400 years ago .
There is a " consciousness of a supreme creator and a system that he has provided " , he says .
What we know as the conventional Western way does not have that , which is " really the major difference between the two " , he adds .
In practical terms , the most significant difference is that charging interest is not allowed in Islamic finance .
FEATURES OF ISLAMIC ECONOMY
Dealing in interest , liquor , pork , gambling or pornography are prohibited under Sharia law Islam forbids all forms of economic activity which it deems morally or socially harmful Individuals must spend their wealth judiciously and not hoard it , keep it idle or squander it Muslims have a duty to contribute a percentage of their wealth to deprived and poor sections of Muslim society Neither are most forms of speculative investment permitted , such as hedging or derivatives trading .
" We do n't recognise the concept of interest ... to look for some profit from trading money , " explains Dr Bambang Brodjonegoro from the Islamic Development Bank .
" In the Islamic concept , money is strictly for the purpose of exchange or storing value , but not for the transaction of looking for excessive profit , " he says .
Sharing risks
How then , does an Islamic bank , and a customer who puts money in that bank , make a profit ?
The Qur'an contains principles Muslims must follow when they do business
The system is asset - based , with tangible assets or commodities at the heart of it .
There are buyers and sellers , not borrowers and lenders .
Here is a comparison .
In Los Angeles a customer who wants to borrow money to buy a car would go to a conventional bank and agree a loan .
The bank would hand over the money .
There would be regular repayments , which include interest accrued on the loan .
In Lahore a customer could go to an Islamic bank and sign a contract with the bank to buy a car from them .
The bank would not loan the money but buy the car itself .
Then it would sell it to the customer at a mark up .
The customer would agree to pay back the cost in instalments over a regular period .
One of the core principles at the heart of Islamic economics is risk sharing .
The bank and the people who put their money in it share any profit , or loss , from investments .
" In Islam we appreciate merit , so if someone works harder in a business ... they ( the bank ) will get the sharing benefit , " explains Dr Brodjonegoro .
" The more important thing is that there will be no bank that rules everything .
It will be bank and borrowers at the same level and they share the risk and benefit . "
Alternative way
This sense of equality is important .
It is one of the defining characteristics which proponents of Islamic economics say make it different from the conventional western way .
It is time for Islamic finance to pause and think of the direction it is taking
Prof. Habib Ahmed , Islamic finance expert Islamic economics also highlights a belief in benefitting the wider Muslim community .
The former IMF Executive Director Dr Mirakhor says that it chimes with " a movement toward becoming more ' other conscious ' ... having consciousness about the other fellow , about the general public interest . "
This contrasts with what he described as the " simple narrow basis of self interest which motivates , supposedly , the economic agents in the liberal economic system . "
Some see the Islamic model as an alternative .
Others see it as complementary to the system which has dominated the western world .
" I do n't think that this Islamic banking system is the alternative , that we have one or the other .
I think this is a complimentary service , a way of doing service , " says Prof Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu , Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Countries .
" It needs to be an option there where people can find different ways of doing the same thing . "
Compromising principles Islamic economics is not the exclusive preserve of Muslims .
UK has 8th largest Islamic finance sector according to the DTI London is emerging as a major financial centre for Islamic finance .
Islamic banking products are also widely used by non Muslims in Malaysia .
" This is an alternative system that can be applied to everybody .
Everybody can use it regardless of their religion , " says Dr Brodjonegoro from the Islamic Development Bank .
Major banks like Britain 's HSBC and Citi of the US have set up Islamic banking subsidiaries that are flourishing .
Some of the champions of the Islamic way want to see business expand beyond the natural market of Muslim countries .
They believe that now , more than ever , there is a market for non Muslims who share in the values espoused in Islamic economics .
But there are some who fear that by expanding the Islamic way is becoming less Islamic .
Time to reflect " Unfortunately what is happening is that Islamic finance in some ways is moving more and more closely to the conventional finance , " says Prof Habib Ahmed , a world authority on Islamic finance .
" If you look at the development in the past few years , Islamic finance appears to be mimicking most of the products of conventional finance . "
There has never been a better time to champion an economic model which is different to the one laying in shreds on Wall Street , says Prof Ahmed .
But he believes that the Islamic concept is being diluted .
" As people after this crisis are looking for solutions ... the Islamic finance industry is moving towards that very system , " he says .
" I think it is time for Islamic finance to pause and think of the direction it is taking " .

If you have a friend or relative that is always surprising you with things that they assume you will like ( and for the most part , you do n't ) -- then you can probably relate to consumers disgruntled over ' forced '
Windows updates that install without consent of the PC owner .
Phantom Updates : Started June 9 , 2009
According to the Windows Secrets newsletter , a number of people have noticed that their PCs have newly - installed updates and security patches once their machines are turned on or rebooted .
These " phantom updates " have appeared as early as June 9th , 2009 .
( Source : windowssecrets.com )
The problem with " phantom updates " is that most consumers have asked Microsoft not to install anything on their computers without prior knowledge or notification .
This means that these people went into Windows Update ( the default update service ) and set their options to require an okay from them before any downloads or installations are made .
In Windows Update , only the " automatic " setting allows downloads and installations to be made without asking for further permission from the user .
How Could this Mix - Up Have Happened ?
According to Windows Secrets , incomplete downloads are to blame .
If you have incomplete update (s ) downloaded at the time of shutdown , Windows will not display these updates as pending .
However , Windows will start installing any successfully downloaded updates , even if the user told Windows Update not to do so prior .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Incomplete Updates : Nothing New , says Microsoft
Incomplete update downloads are nothing new with Windows Update .
Microsoft even has a Knowledge Base document that says if a download is not completed all at once , Automatic Updates terminates it and the remainder of the update is re-installed a few days later -- without asking the user .
Record Number of Updates and Patches to Blame ?
Some suggest that the " phantom updates " started to appear as early as June 9th , 2009 .
On this day , Microsoft issued a record number of updates ( 10 security updates and 31 individual bug patches ) which were the most in a single month since the company began regularly - scheduled updates in 2003 .
( Source : cio.com )
The belief is that the large number of updates and patches could have exceeded the server capacity , which would have resulted in some downloads failing before completion .
Whatever the reason for the mishap , Microsoft is downplaying the situation , claiming that concerns are unwarranted and the confusion will eventually dissipate in the next few days .

The benefits are indisputable .
Since July 1 , 2001 , all drugs including cocaine and heroine have been decriminalized in Portugal .
Eight years later , consumption has decreased significantly .
About half of the nearly 400 lives lost every year to overdoses are now saved .
Drug users had represented more than half of all new HIV cases in Portugal , or nearly 1,400 individuals infected annually .
That toll has fallen to 400 per year , about 25 percent of the total .
Ironically , a recent study — O Estado da Nação , sponsored by a newspaper ( Diário de Notícias ) radio station ( TSF ) and a TV station ( SIC ) — showed that a large number of Portuguese actually believe that narcotic - related problems have increased in recent years .
This paradox mirrors the difficulty health experts faced in the 1990 ’s convincing lawmakers and the public that decriminalizing narcotic possession for personal use would help address the runaway growth in substance abuse .
“ We heard just about every argument , ” remembers João Goulão , director of the Instituto da Droga e Toxicodependência ( IDT ) , a government drug policy agency .
“ People said that Portugal would become a paradise for drug dealers , a tourist destination for drug addicts .
It did n’t happen .
In fact , we now have objective data that shows quite the opposite . ”

Motion Controls and Why I ’m Not Convinced I Want To Use Them
June 2 , 2009
A common element of the Big Three ’s E3 press conferences this year has been motion controls .
It ’s been long - rumoured that Microsoft was developing a response to the Wii ’s control mechanism , and that Sony would be making an investment a bit more daring than the SIXAXIS controls .
With Nintendo ’s Wii MotionPlus ( announced at last year ’s E3 , and coming out next week ) , Microsoft ’s Natal and Sony ’s EyeToy wands , the console manufacturers are all now committed to providing some form of motion control .
I ’m not convinced I want to use any of them .
Nintendo
But first , a quick rundown of my thoughts on each of the solutions offered .
I ’ll start with Nintendo and the Wii Motion Plus add - on .
Flash back to E3 2008 when the Big N unveiled the 4 cm , $ 20 wart that promised to make the Wii remote … more better .
My initial thought was , and still is , that this is what the Wii has purported to offer gamers since day one .
Instead , the Wii has become known for its “ waggle ” controls – reacting to movement , if not capturing it for true analysis .
The MotionPlus add - on rectifies the remote ’s shortcomings , though you can bet it ’ll be a hard sale .
Good thing Nintendo is wisely bundling it with Wii Sports Resort , among other games that use it .
So there ’s a sense of entitlement involved , as the Wii already claimed to have motion controls .
Why should the consumer pay for “ better ” controls ?
Yes , I am well aware of the technical reasoning and the new ability to distinguish linear movements , but do all consumers think that way ( or care ) ?
Setting that aside however , the MotionPlus is actually the cheapest solution of the three offerings , assuming Microsoft and Sony are n’t letting their products go for less than twenty dollars .
Nintendo’s is also the first to market , hitting North America in just under a week .
Pity the software line - up is nothing to write home about .
Two of the three 3rd - party titles at launch are ( wait for it ) … tennis .
Again .
Not doing much to alleviate the feeling that you already bought this once .
Microsoft
Microsoft was holding out on committing to motion controls and had , up until yesterday , remained completely uninvolved in the whole thing .
That ’s not to say they were n’t watching carefully .
Nintendo was obviously on to something with the accessibility of the Wii though , and so Microsoft developed Project Natal ( pronounced like in Natalie , not like in prenatal ) .
If you have n’t seen it yet , check out the promo video they showed yesterday .
I like the simplicity of the Natal solution : one camera , no controllers .
That ’s an appealing interface in my mind , though perhaps not for traditional gaming .
I really do n’t think holding my hands in the air to grasp a pretend - steering - wheel is going to add to my experience ; indeed I can only see it detracting from the immersion .
And it looks extremely tiring .
Did anybody ever play Totemball ?
It had an achievement for playing the game for 20 minutes straight .
If that ’s worthy of an achievement , I ’m not interested in playing .
I was particularly interested in the skateboarding demo , but that ’s probably just personal experience talking .
It does thicken the plot for Tony Hawk ’s RIDE though ( obsolete before it launches ? ) .
Overall though , I ’m simply not convinced .
The whole video reminded me of other “ visionary ” Microsoft videos .
Great production values and intriguing mock - ups , but you have to take it all with a grain of salt because it ’s not an honest - to - goodness product you can buy yet .
Future Vision Montage
I ’d be more inclined to write the whole thing off right now except it turns out that Johnny Lee is involved .
I ’ll leave it at that , but if you have n’t seen his other projects , you should definitely check them out .
Sony
Sony dipped its toe in the water back with the launch of the Playstation 3 by including SIXAXIS controls , which was probably the smallest thing they could have done to allow themselves to tout “ motion controls ” for the system .
Few games have used the accelerometer with any great success , which suggests that you ca n’t simply shoehorn motion controls into traditional games .
Today , however , Sony followed up on their rumoured wand technology by demoing some prototypes of their EyeToy + wand solution ( which could really use a name ) .
It was just a technical demo , though they are targeting a launch in Spring 2010 .
I ’m mixed about the wand solution .
Sony had working units on - stage , with some inspiring software ( again , just demos ) .
The technology seems sound in terms of functionality , but the implementation is cumbersome right now .
After all , the Wii needs one remote .
Natal needs one camera .
Sony ’s solution uses a camera and two remotes .
Impressive motion - sensing accuracy and creative software , but overall the whole thing looks like it needs a lot more time in the oven .
The Problem with Motion Controls
So the technology is getting faster and more accurate , and the software is slowly becoming more compelling – but I ’m still not convinced I want to use any of them .
The problems , as I see them , stem from the idea of gaming providing a different reality for the gamer yet motion sensing pulls things back to the player ’s reality .
The first is that accurate sensing of the player ’s motions means that the player needs to accurate in his or her motions .
The lesser problem here is that games can require the player to be proficient in skills they simply do n’t have .
How many players are truly good baseball players / swordsmen /etc ?
If you are terrible at hitting a ball in real life , the game will detect this with punishing accuracy .
This is something EA has already spoken about , and the solution is generally to lower the requirements on the player by adding in - game assistance or simply faking part of the simulation .
The bigger problem is that even if you are fantastic at hitting a ball out of the air , it ’s difficult to do so with only visual feedback .
The speed of the motion tracking has improved greatly , so delay in motions may not be factor anymore .
And controllers are now ( reportedly ) sensing 1:1 motion , so the player should be able to perform an action and have the game accurately detect it in real - time .
However , the motion made by the player is only what they believe to be required based on the image on - screen .
Depth is an illusion on a television screen – it ’s up to the player ’s brain to translate the perceived position of a virtual racket to the position of his / her own hand in order to hit the perceived position of the virtual ball .
That ’s tough to do , skilled or not .
Sony ’s E3 demo showcased this nicely when the demonstrator could n’t hit the tennis ball with anything smaller than a stop sign .
But all of this takes a backseat to what I feel is the Achilles heel of motion controls : reconciling the real - world and game realities .
If you give a player 1:1 motion controls , you need to remove all limitations on that motion for the in - game avatar .
If the player is wielding a sword , it had better be able to cut through everything with no resistance .
If not , the situation arises where the player has made a swing in real - life , but the sword has struck a wall in the game .
Now the the player ’s hand is in a different position than the sword in the game and it ’s up to either the player or the game , or both , to resolve this discrepancy .
It ’s not convincing and it ’s certainly not immersive .
The solution until now seems to be to give the player free reign .
The tennis ball provides no resistance on the racket – the player can swing right through .
Swords ?
Just make it a lightsabre and it ’ll go through everything .
There ’s no easy way to solve this problem , so developers are opting to make it a non-issue .
It ’s an acceptable approach for preserving the fun and playability of games , but it ’s a serious barrier to making motion controls truly convincing .
Oh and nevermind the fact that if ever one of these motion solution skips a beat , all illusion is broken .
Ever wind up a golf swing only to have the game interpret that you were taking the shot ?
Ugh .
In case you have n’t seen it , the target of today ’s comic / rant is a ridiculous piece in the New York Times by David Brooks titled ( no joke ) “ The End of Philosophy ” .
The title is especially absurd because he does n’t target philosophy in the article at all – just ethics , which of course ( but perhaps Mr. Brooks does n’t understand this ) is a sub- field of philosophy , not philosophy itself .
The worst part is the nature of the argument against doing normative ethics .
As near as I can tell , the argument is that since the sciences ( psychology , socio - biology , etc ) are giving us evidence that moral judgments are something we make automatically , based on emotion and intuition rather than reason , we need n’t concern ourself with speculations about moral principles or justifications or the like .
Morality is all built into us already , so there ’s nothing to figure out !
Right ?
Wrong .
This argument is , of course , completely idiotic .
It commits the naturalistic fallacy in a manner that I might expect from one of my intro-philosophy students , not from an Op - Ed Columnist in a major publication like the New York Times .
The very obvious fact is that no amount of description of how we actually tend to make moral judgments is going to resolve the question whether those moral judgments are right or not .
To answer that question , we ’re going to have to engage in good old fashioned philosophical reasoning and argumentation about moral principles .
It should be no surprise if reflective moral evaluation yields the conclusion that at least some of our natural tendancies and biases produce faulty snap moral judgments and we decide that they need to be compensated for in various ways .
But this is something that Mr. Brooks ’ position rules out in principle .
Anyway , here is a nice blog on the article by one Sabrina Jamil ( who first brought my attention the article ) , and another one here by PZ Myers .
They ’re both worth looking at .
And those of you readers who are involved in philosophy , or who care about it at all – please spread the word .
These sorts of ridiculous misconceptions of philosophy are damaging to our discipline and need to be answered .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States plans to pledge more than $ 900 million ( 621 million pounds ) to help rebuild Gaza after Israel ’s invasion and strengthen the Western - backed Palestinian Authority , a U.S. official said on Monday .
The money will be channelled through U.N. and other bodies and will not be distributed via the militant group Hamas , which rules Gaza , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plans to make the announcement next week at a Gaza donors conference in Egypt .
Photo Manipulation was already been practice since 1860 .
Before computers , photo manipulation was made by retouching with ink , paint , double - exposure , piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom , or scratching Polaroids .
Now , with the use of Adobe Photoshop , Paint Shop Pro , Corel Photopaint , and other software program an image can now be edit with ease .
A good quality and angle of both images is a must to achieve a good manipulation result .
In this post you will see an examples of photo manipulation .
Here is 22 Excellent Fruit Photo Manipulations .
These showcase is more on manipulated fruits combining with other elements to come up an impressive art - form .
Two years before the 9/11 attacks on America , George W. Bush told a Houston journalist if elected president , “ I ’m going to invade Iraq . ”
Bush made the comments about starting an aggressive war to veteran Houston Chronicle reporter Mickey Herskowitz , then working with Bush on his book “ A Charge To Keep , ” later brought out by publisher William Morrow .
This disclosure was uncovered by Russ Baker , an award - winning investigative reporter when he interviewed Herskowitz for his own book , “ Family of Secrets ” ( Bloomsbury Press ) about the Bush dynasty .
However , Baker says , when he approached The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times with the potentially devastating story to President Bush prior to the 2004 presidential election , they declined to publish it .
In a new book , “ Media In Crisis ” ( Doukathsan ) , Baker quotes Herskowitz as telling him : “ He ( Bush ) said he wanted to do it ( invade Iraq ) , and the reason he wanted to do it is he had been led to understand that you could not really have a successful presidency unless you were seen as commander - in - chief , unless you were seen as waging a war . ”
Bush told Herskowitz that his father ( President George H.W. Bush ) knew that from Panama and ( President Ronald ) Reagan knew that from Grenada and …( UK Prime Minister ) Maggie Thatcher knew this from the Falklands . ”
According to Baker , Bush told Herskowitz , “ The ideal thing was a small war , and this is why Bush said nobody was going to be killed in Iraq because he thought it would be small war . ”
Bush co-authored his book “ A Charge To Keep ” with Karen Hughes .
In his introduction to the work , Bush wrote , “ I thank Mickey Herskowitz for his help and work in getting the project started . ”
Baker said he believed if a major daily ran his Herskowitz interview it “ could have changed the election ” but “ I could not get it published . ”
The story was turned down by both The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post .
He described the Post as “ scared because of the Dan Rather thing , and they said to me , ‘ What do you have in the way of evidence ? ’ ”
Baker replied , “ Here ’s a tape of Mickey Herskowitz , who ’s published 20 - some books , long - time journalist of the Houston Chronicle , friend of the Bush family , telling me this story . ”
The Post said , “ It ’s not enough .
In this climate , we need Bush on tape saying this . ”
Expressing his disappointment over the rejection , Baker said , “ Well , that standard has never applied anywhere . ”
The story about Bush ’s comments to Herskowitz is one of many about the frustrations journalists face in getting the truth to the public that appear in “ Media In Crisis . ”
The book contains the comments of five Pulitzer Prize - winning journalists , among others , and officials of various journalism foundations , as well as veteran broadcasters .
The book also covers the economic woes of daily newspapers and their future , the rise of Internet bloggers and other news - purveying media , the quality of reporting , and the quality of instruction in journalism schools .
Publisher Doukathsan Press is affiliated with the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , where a “ Media In Crisis ” conference was held last March upon which the new book is based .
The cost of “ Media In Crisis ” is $ 15 .

Note ( March 4 ) :
When this was first published yesterday , the post title indicated that this was a BTB “ exclusive . ”
This morning , I ’m now seeing other versions of the email on the web with the sender ’s name and email included .
Since I had originally redacted that name and email , it ’s clear that others have independently received copies of the same email .
I am therefore restoring the email to its original form with the info included .
Update ( March 5 ) : I have re-redacted the sender ’s name and email address in response to a request from the sender ’s relative .
The Illinois House will begin considering another Civil Unions bill this week .
Introduced by Rep. Greg Harris on February 20 , HB 2234 has been assigned to the Youth and Family Committee , which will hold a hearing on Thursday .
We ’ve received word that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints has engaged its private communications network to bombard state legislators with phone calls in opposition to the bill .
The Mormon Church maintains a private internet social - networking and website service in lieu of individual churches having their own individual Internet web sites .
This allows the church to oversee the information that is made available to members and nonmembers .
It also allows the church to maintain private information that is only made available to church members .
Among the many capabilities the web site has for members who are authorized to log in is the ability to send private email to other church members in the same ward .
It also allows a ward bishop to send a blanket email to all members of his ward , and it allows a stake president to send a blanket email to all members of his stake .
But this is key : no individual member can send a blanket email to all members of his ward without it first going through his or her bishop .
The same is true at the stake level , where the stake president would have to first authorize the message .
So when a church member receives a broadcast message , he or she can be assured that it has the blessing , so to speak , of the bishop or stake president .
In a private email sent out to LDS members of at least one ward in Illinois , church members are being encouraged to call their representative to voice their opposition to the bill , which would provide same - sex couples with recognition and limited protections under Illinois law .
But the official LDS - sanctioned email to members is loaded with much of the same misinformation that was present in the campaign against California ’s Proposition 8 .
A trusted source sent me a copy of that email , authorized by Bishop Chris Church , of the Nauvoo , Illinois 3rd Ward , which was sent out by that web site ’s ward administrator :

Subject : Civil Union bill scheduled for a hearing Thursday – calls needed This message has been authorized for sending by Bishop Church .
The Civil Union Bill ( HB 2234 ) has been scheduled for a hearing in the Youth and Family Committee this week on Thursday , March 5 , 2009 at 9:00 a.m. in Springfield .
If the bill is voted out of committee , it becomes eligible for a vote before the full Illinois House of Representatives .
This bill will legalize civil unions in the state of Illinois , and will treat such civil unions with the same legal obligations , responsibilities , protections and benefits as are afforded within marriage .
In other words , civil unions will be different in name only from marriage .
As has already been seen in Massachusetts , this will empower the public schools to begin teaching this lifestyle to our young children regardless of parental requests otherwise .
It will also create grounds for rewriting all social mores ; the current push in Massachusetts is to recognize and legalize all transgender rights ( An individual in Massachusetts can now change their drivers license to the gender they believe themselves to be , regardless of actual gender , which means that confused men and women are now legally entering one another ’s bathrooms and locker rooms .
What kind of a safety issue is this for our children ? ) .
Furthermore , while the bill legalizes civil unions , it will be used in the courts to show discrimination and will ultimately lead to court mandated same - sex marriages .
To help defeat this bill , please call your state representative and state senator and ask that they support traditional marriage and vote against the civil unions bill .
If you are unsure who your legislators are , please see the link at the end of this email .
Also , please take a moment and call the following members of the Youth and Family Committee to encourage them to vote no on this bill .
We need 4 votes to keep it from passing out of the committee .
And – as always , please pass this on to all who believe in protecting our families and our children .
If you are interested in attending the hearing , it will be held on Thursday , March 5th at 9:00 a.m. in Springfield in Room 122B of the Capitol Building ( I can give you directions to the Capitol Building if needed ) .
Members of the Youth and Family Committee :
Rep. Greg Harris ( D - Chicago ) ( Greg Harris is also the sponsor of this bill , but he needs to hear your opposition to this bill )
Chairperson
217-782-3835 Rep. LaShawn K. Ford ( D - Chicago )

I do n’t ordinarily have access to internal LDS communications like this .
This is a very rare glimpse into how the LDS church is able to crank up its membership for political action .
If this message is going out in one ward in Nauvoo , it ’s a safe bet that similar messages are going out in other wards and stakes .
Update : Bishop Church has sent another message to his ward this afternoon :

I have more about that here .
WHETHER to teach young children a second language is disputed among teachers , researchers and pushy parents .
On the one hand , acquiring a new tongue is said to be far easier when young .
On the other , teachers complain that children whose parents speak a language at home that is different from the one used in the classroom sometimes struggle in their lessons and are slower to reach linguistic milestones .

A study just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences may help resolve this question by getting to the nub of what is going on in a bilingual child 's brain , how a second language affects the way he thinks , and thus in what circumstances being bilingual may be helpful .
Agnes Kovacs and Jacques Mehler at the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste say that some aspects of the cognitive development of infants raised in a bilingual household must be undergoing acceleration in order to manage which of the two languages they are dealing with .
The aspect of cognition in question is part of what is termed the brain 's “ executive function ” .
This allows people to organise , plan , prioritise activity , shift their attention from one thing to another and suppress habitual responses .
Bilingualism is common in Trieste which , though Italian , is almost surrounded by Slovenia .
So Dr Kovacs and Dr Mehler looked at 40 “ preverbal ” seven - month - olds , half raised in monolingual and half in bilingual households , and compared their performances in a task that needs control of executive function .
First , the babies were trained to expect the appearance of a puppet on a screen after they had heard a set of meaningless words invented by the researchers .
Then the words , and the location of the puppet , were changed .
When this was done , the monoglot babies had difficulty overcoming their learnt response , even when the researchers gave them further clues that a switch had taken place .
The bilingual babies , however , found it far easier to switch their attention — counteracting the previously learnt , but no longer useful response .
Monitoring languages and keeping them separate is part of the brain 's executive function , so these findings suggest that even before a child can speak , a bilingual environment may speed up that function 's development .
Before rushing your offspring into Tongan for Toddlers , though , there are a few caveats .
For one thing , these precocious cognitive benefits have been demonstrated so far only in “ crib ” bilinguals — those living in households where two languages are spoken routinely .
The researchers speculate that it might be the fact of having to learn two languages in the same setting that requires greater use of executive function .
So whether those benefits accrue to children who learn one language at home , and one at school , remains unclear .

Advertisement US President Barack Obama is delivering a much - anticipated speech on US relations with the Muslim world .
Correspondents say it will avoid specific proposals but will cover all major regional issues , including Iran and the Israeli - Palestinian question .
As Mr Obama arrived in Egypt , Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the US was still " deeply hated " in the Middle East .
Earlier , Mr Obama held talks in Riyadh with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia .
' Truth - telling '
After landing in Cairo , Mr Obama headed in his motorcade to the Kuba palace along streets empty except for the soldiers lining the route .
Mr Obama then held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
OBAMA'S TOUR 3 June : Saudi Arabia - talks with King Abdullah on Israel - Palestinian peace negotiations 4 June : Egypt - talks with President Hosni Mubarak , keynote speech at Cairo university 5 June : Germany - meets Chancellor Angela Merkel , visits to Dresden and to Buchenwald concentration camp 6 June : France - meets President Nicolas Sarkozy , attends D - Day events in Normandy Mr Mubarak said the pair had a " candid and frank " discussion of " all problems in the region " , including Iran .
Mr Obama said : " We discussed the situation between Israel and the Palestinians .
We discussed how we can move forward in a constructive way that brings about peace and prosperity for all people in the region . "
He said the US was committed to working in partnership with countries in the Middle East .
Mr Obama visited the Sultan Hassan mosque ahead of his speech at Cairo University .
Mr Obama 's aides said the speech , to be broadcast to an audience of millions around the world , would be a " truth - telling " exercise .
The BBC's Christian Fraser in Cairo says Barack Obama wants to give a message of respect to a region which has often felt ignored , misunderstood or patronised by the US .
Our correspondent says conservative elements in Egypt have suggested they are prepared to listen to Mr Obama as long as there is substance behind the rhetoric .
The president is expected to use the speech to discuss the current state of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and to set out how he views the conflict .
HAVE YOUR SAY Let 's get real .
This is a bunch of propaganda Dean Smith , Toronto
He will not include any specific proposals , but will articulate what he believes both sides need to do to resolve the current stalemate , says our correspondent .
White House officials have said that one speech alone will not heal divisions but could start a process to " re-energise the dialogue with the Muslim world " .
Presidential advisers said there would be a " forthright discussion " of democracy , human rights and nuclear non-proliferation .
However , they denied Mr Obama had issued any ultimatum to Israel on the question of settlement building in the West Bank .
Israel is resisting calls to freeze building activity in all settlements , but Palestinian leaders have said there can be no progress towards peace without a halt to such construction .
' Action is needed '
As Mr Obama arrived in Egypt , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivered a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of Iran 's Islamic Republic .
Mr Obama was presented with Saudi Arabia 's highest honour Ayatollah Khamenei said : " The nations of this part of the world ... deeply hate America .
Even if they give sweet and beautiful [ speeches ] to the Muslim nation that will not create change .
Action is needed . "
On the Saudi Arabia leg of his tour , Mr Obama held talks with King Abdullah .
The president was presented with the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit , the kingdom 's highest honour .
King Abdullah said the medallion was " only given to the very few friends of the king " and that Mr Obama was " certainly one of those " .
As Mr Obama arrived in Saudi Arabia , Arabic television station Al Jazeera broadcast a message said to be from al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden .
The message accused Mr Obama of ordering Pakistan to crack down on militants in the Swat valley and said Mr Obama and his administration had " sown new seeds to increase hatred and revenge on America " .
White House spokesman Robert Gibb said it was not surprising that al - Qaeda " would want to shift attention away from the president 's historic and continued efforts to have an open dialogue with the Muslim world " .
Apart from a stop - over in Iraq in April , this is Mr Obama 's first time in the region since becoming president .
Mr Obama hopes to set a new tone which is designed to isolate extremists in the region and re-establish the understanding the US gained after 9/11 and lost over Iraq , says the BBC's Paul Reynolds .
After Cairo , Mr Obama will travel on to Europe for D - Day commemorations .
The BBC News website will carry a fully - annotated transcript of President Obama 's Cairo speech , with analysis of key passages by BBC world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds .

Am I at risk ?
Tools Technical details
0.1 Personal message
Several news stories seem to allude that Microsoft is artificially downplaying the threat , citations of myself are used to underline the headline in an " us against Microsoft " kind of way .
I want to clarify that I have the utmost respect of the MSRC team and I do n't suspect Microsoft to willingly downplay anything .
They also claim I am from Belgium , I am obviously from Luxembourg .
The bug also is not the same as the IIS4 / 5 one , it 's root cause is similar .
That 's about it .
About :
The video above shows the different Webdav settings and the different impacts they have .
Note that code execution is only possible if these pre-conditions are met .
I am not sure how often this kind of setup exists , if I had to guess i'd say not often .

1. Updates
25/05/2009 - Update : As Nicolaos wrote in the comment section of this post .
IP / Domain filters can be bypassed the same way .
In other words if you have a filter for certain IP adresses , you can bypass them .
Update : Todd Manning over at Breakpoint labs did comprehensive tests on which Unicode encodings work .
The answer is a lot - IPS / IPS vendors should update their signatures .
Update : Sharepoint and OWA are not affected by this bug - more info here
Update : Skull security has a good write up here , they patched cadaver to exploit this vulnerability .
Nmap script here .
Update : Video detailing the different settings and the different impacts ( up to remote code execution ) Credit : Rangos
Update : Nmap IIS6
Webdav scanner added to tools section .
Update : Webdav Network scanner added to tools section .
Update : Update : Microsoft SRD
Team gives more insight and details ( Must read ) Update : http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/971492.mspx
Update : For IIS 6 : Write access is not allowed per default - as such you can only " upload " content if IUSR_anonymous is granted write access .
This is not the case per default .
Update : IIS5 and IIS7 are NOT affected - IIS5 and 5.1 are affected ( according to MS
Update :
It is unclear how this affects Exchange 2003 ( which allows access to inboxes over webdav )
2. Bulletins
3 . Am I at risk ?
Below is a summary by Microsofts SRD Team , please note that the below enumeration leads to think that the chances that your setup is vulnerable is VERY unlikely .
IMHO this is not the case , take a standard install of IIS6 , enable Webdav , setup a protected folder requiring basic auth .
And that 's it , you are vulnerable
not at risk
An IIS server not running WebDAV is safe .
The Windows Server 2003 IIS ( version 6 ) shipped with WebDAV disabled by default .
The Windows Server 2003 IIS ( version 6 ) shipped with WebDAV disabled by default .
An IIS server not using IIS permissions to restrict content to authenticated users is safe .
An IIS server that does not grant filesystem access to the IUSR_ [ MachineName ] account is safe .
An IIS server that hosts web applications using only forms - based authentication is probably safe .
You are at risk
IF an IIS 5 , 5.1 , or 6.0 webserver is running with WebDAV enabled ( default for IIS5 ) ;
an IIS 5 , 5.1 , or 6.0 webserver is running with WebDAV enabled ; AND the IIS server is using IIS permissions to restrict a subfolder of content to authenticated users ;
the IIS server is using IIS permissions to restrict a subfolder of content to authenticated users ; AND file system access is granted for the restricted content to the IUSR_ [ MachineName ] account ;
file system access is granted for the restricted content to the IUSR_ [ MachineName ] AND a parent folder of the private subfolder allows anonymous access ;
THEN an anonymous remote user may be able to leverage this vulnerability to access files that normally would only be served to authenticated webserver users .
4 Test tools
Specificaly for this vulnerability : Metasploit added test script to the trunk
Webdav network scanner here
Nmap script
For PROPFIND the " translate : f " option is NOT required ( only for GET requests )
Breakpoint labs analysed how the various UTF encodings affected the flaw - lot of variations work .
5. Details
Webdav is not enabled by default on IIS6 , IIS7 + Webdav is not affected IIS 5 and IIS 5.1 are also affected .
Enabling Webdav applies to all websites and does n't have to be enabled per site .
You can actually upload content to the web server , if the IUSR_anonymous has write access to webdav folders .
( To any other folder if the account has write access to other folders )
This seems to have a similar ( root cause ) then the 2001 Unicode IIS4 / 5 bug , but not exactly the same " Translate : f " is required for GET requests , PROPFIND works without the translate optiion .
Temporary disable Webdav .
This is not easy if you have Sharepoint services running .
See here
Backround
In 2001 a path traversal bug was found in IIS4 and IIS5 that lead to a series of serious compromised and massive exploitation ( MS01-026 ) .
It was bad really bad , the simple path traversal was used to compromise systems remotely mainly through calling ( t ) ftp.exe to upload arbitrary content .
nicode conversion was added AFTER the security checks and not before , resulting in the path " ..% c0 % af .. " to be considered a VALID path , yet it is nothing else then " ../.. " in ascii .
More details can be found
The path traversal was possible due to Microsoft 's introduction of UNICODE support into IIS .
The flaw was by design , a typical logical fallacy .
U , resulting in the path " ..% c0 % af .. " to be considered a VALID path , yet it is nothing else then " ../.. " in ascii .
More details can be found here
Figure1 IIS4 / 5 how the security check was supposed to work ( click to enlarge )
Figure 2 - IIS4 / 5 how the security check was implemented ( click to enlarge )
In other words Microsoft , certainly through the late addition of Unicode support to IIS , failed to realize that converting chars to Unicode representation should happen before any " security " checks .
So the flaw was one of logic , Unicode conversion after the security check .
MS09 -
971492
- 2009
The bug discovered by Rangos seems to suffer from a similar logic mistake when requesting source ( translate : f ) that has been introduced in the Webdav component .
It appears that unicode characters are removed after the security checks .

Nicolaos Rangos released another pwnie grade vulnerability yesterday and it's resemblance to the IIS unicode flaw from 2001 was so similar that my jaw first dropped .
Here are a few facts , these are subject to modifications as the news unfolds : Mitigation :- 2001
Here is the logic flaw that lead to the vulnerability in 2001 .
I quickly drafted this in Visio , below is the way it was supposed to work :
Here is how it was implemented : Fast forward 2009 - Kingcope releases a similar vulnerability .
The server will however not execute this asp page - currently no code execution is known to be possible , even if write access is enabled ( see exception below ) .
The reason is that you can't simply issue a GET request to the asp page you just created - it 's password protected and execution over webdav fails .
However code execution would be possible in scenarios where :
You have to give credit to John Hempton , who continues to hammer away at Sheila Bair 's seizure of Wamu and the giveaway to JPMorgan ( JPM ) .
Hempdon ( who did lose money in the move ) is convinced that the whole thing was a sham , purposely done to bail out JPMorgan at the expense of WaMu shareholders , and that it was the cardinal error of the government 's handling of the crisis last fall .
For what it 's worth , this idea has n't gotten much traction , except with angry Wamu shareholders .
Now Hempton 's got another interesting nugget in his arsenal following the release of the stress tests .
He notes that when WaMu was sold to JPMorgan , it was expected that in an extreme scenario , there were $ 54 billion more in losses coming from the end of 2007 .
At that point , an " extreme " scenario was unemployment around 8 % .
The losses were entirely from WaMu 's mortgage portfolio .
Now the bank lost $ 8 billion in 2008 , leaving potentially $ 46 billion more in losses .
Again , probably more if the 8 % unemployment was considered extreme at the time of the seizure .
But , in the stress test that was just revealed , JPM's own mortgage portfolio -- which now should include all the WaMu losses -- only includes $ 39 billion in remaining mortgage losses , and these are when the stress tests are looking much worse .
This leaves two possibilities .
One is that the stress tests are a sham and are dramatically underestimating the losses , in which case JPM , the rest of the banks and the regulators who oversaw the whole process are participating in a sham .
Or , the original seizure was purposely based on faulty assumptions , causing WaMu shareholders to get ripped off .
Let 's take a look at my bleary - eyed , decaf - guzzling process at 9 a.m. :
STEP 1 : Turn on TV and hear update that Gallup Poll says more Americans are " Pro- Life " than " Pro-Choice " for the first time since 1995 .
STEP 2 : Google " gallup abortion poll "
STEP 3 : Click on sensationalistic headline " Gallup 's stunning abortion poll : Pro-life beats pro-choice‎ " from Kansas City Star .
STEP 4 : Read article 's brief , limited presentation of poll , including statement that
A new Gallup Poll contains stunning news for the pro-choice crowd :
Their side is losing , and the pro-life / anti-abortion side is finally winning .
STEP 5 : Read email , receive phone call and read blog comments touting the poll or refuting the poll ( " Gallup was wrong on all of the election results " ) .
STEP 6 : Summarize the inference from news , article , blogs , call and emails : " pro-life " means " opposed to legal abortion . "
Therefore , " opposition to legal abortion " currently outweighs " support of legal opposition . "
Suspect that this is not in any way possible .
Decided to analyze the facts from the source .
STEP 7 : Return to Google results and click on first result , the official Gallup link , to read poll questions and see response for myself .
STEP 8 : Read and evaluate list of historical questions .
Questions and responses from 2009 May 7 - 10 include :
Do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances , legal only under certain circumstances , or illegal in all circumstances ?
22 % Legal under any circumstances 53 % Legal only under certain circumstances 23 % Illegal in all circumstances 2 % No opinion
With respect to the abortion issue , would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life ?
NOTE : Trends taken only from polls where pro-life / pro-choice was asked following other questions on abortion ( for example , what circumstances should abortion be legal trend )
42 % Pro-choice 51 % Pro-life 2 % Mixed / Neither ( vol . )
4 % Do n't knowwhat terms mean ( vol . )
1 % No opinion
51 % self - identify as Pro-Life , but only 23 % feel abortion should be illegal ?
Does n't that mean that more than half of the " Pro- Lifers " polled in favor of legal abortion ?
And is n't that GREAT NEWS - and far more " stunning " ?
It certainly is to me .
STEP 9 : Boiling down the argument .
Is n't what we are arguing about in this Pro-Choice / Pro-Life debate the " right to choose " ?
And if so , do we care how people feel or self - identify as long as they are not trying to inflict those values upon other people ?
And does n't this poll show that by a vast majority , Americans are in favor of allowing some form of legal abortion ?
And do n't those numbers include MOST OF THE PRO - LIFE RESPONDENTS ?
Just to show minor " trending over time , " I took a look at the 2008 answers .
This time , Pro-Life or Pro-Choice was a stand - alone question .
But let 's look at the separate results :
2008 Sep 5 - 7
43 % Pro-Life
51 % Pro-Choice 2008 May 8-11
33 % Overturn Roe v Wade
52 % Maintain Roe v Wade
15 % No Opinion
So what I see from this poll is that there is no guaranteed correlation between being Pro-Life and Anti-Choice ( which is what I call it to stay focused on what is at issue in the debate : whether or not women should have the right to choose to have an abortion ) , if choice is defined as legal access to abortion , as established by Roe v. Wade .
And that is how I , personally , define choice .
So ...wow .
On a day when just 300 protesters out of thousands of attendees gathered against Obama as Notre Dame 's selection as commencement speaker ... on a day when Republican Party Chair Michael Steele tried to falsely recharacterize months of the debate as solely being opposition to Obama receiving an honorary degree ... on a morning where now a day 's worth of headlines have sensationally headlined this poll as evidence that we are losing ground ...
We are maintaining and gaining ground on two fronts .
First , support for legal abortion , the real issue at hand , remains strong .
And second , those who oppose abortion for personal reasons are separating their personal beliefs from their legal considerations .
I feel like saying , " Thanks , Gallup . "
But first , since I am not a statistician , I welcome other analysis of the data that would help me and others better understand the import of these numbers .
And second , I want to continue stressing the important of speaking from information , not opinion .
And challenging filtered presentations that are spouted off as fact .
The city of Bozeman , Montana has decided to back off on its requirement that job applicants hand over their logins and passwords for every social network they belong to .
The city announced in a meeting ( PDF ) on Monday that it had suspended the practice as of Friday , June 19 and that it would update its hiring procedures within 30 days to determine a more appropriate level of screening for employees .
Bozeman made headlines last week when the media discovered the city 's curious background check procedures , which involved handing over logins to sites like Facebook , MySpace , Twitter , and more .
City employees would then be able to dig through any information applicants have put online , regardless of whether it 's accessible to the public .
Needless to say , such a request caused an explosion of outrage , not only among Bozeman residents , but on the Internet in general .
It 's clear now , however , that the city has gotten a major whiff of its own bad PR and has decided to back off .
In its meeting yesterday , city officials clarified that no candidate was ever disqualified for not disclosing the login info , and that the only staff to review password - protect information was the HR department .
Still , the city is red -faced over the incident .
" We appreciate the concern many citizens have expressed regarding this practice and apologize for the negative impact this issue is having on the City of Bozeman , " City Manager Chris A. Kukulski said in a statement .
" This was an honest mistake , " he continued .
" Human Resources , our Police and Fire Departments were doing something they believed was consistent with our core values .
I take full responsibility for this decision and we will work hard to regain the trust and confidence of the City Commission and our community . "
Motorists who see petrol stations driving up their prices over Easter should dob them in , the NRMA said today , as average petrol prices are predicted to be the lowest for this holiday period since 2005 .
Prices in Sydney should be between $ 1.23 and $ 1.25 this weekend , an NRMA spokesman said , and should not exceed $ 1.30 .
But if people notice petrol stations charging more than $ 1.30 in Sydney , they should use their mobile phones , or go online , to record the price on the NRMA 's new motorist feedback website Road Tube , www.roadtube.com.au.
NRMA Motoring & Services President Wendy Machin said in a statement that people should not " suffer in silence " and should instead send video , photos or blog comments to the website .
Motorists can then log on and see which stations have the highest prices , and the data will be collected for the ACCC .
' Missing ' Republican Gov of SC , one time GOP 2012 Prez hopeful , was in Argentina being ' unfaithful to my wife ' ...
UPDATE : Fox ' News ' does it again !
Labels Sanford as a DEMOCRAT !
Brad Friedman Byon 6/24/2009 , 12:49 pm PT
We 've been covering this on the Malloy Show , but I have n't been able to keep up with it on the blog , unfortunately .
So , this just in :
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford admits to extramarital affair
Sanford admits to a love affair with an Argentine woman .
' The bottom line is this : I 've been unfaithful to my wife . '
He apologizes to his family and the people of South Carolina .
The very quick back - details :
Monday : Gov ' missing ' for six days , did n't tell wife where he was , missed Father 's Day with four sons .
Wife says he was going off to write , staff says he was hiking Appalachian Trail .
Tuesday : Staff says
Gov contacted them , was surprised at the hubbub , would return to office on Wed .
Today : Sanford caught by reporter returning from Argentina , not Appalachian Trail .
Presser announced .
Sanford admits affair .
All of that follows , of course , on the recent admission by the GOP 's other ( once ) 2012 Presidential hopeful , Sen. John Ensign of Nevada , that he , too , was having an affair .
If I have time to fill in more back details here later , with links , I will .
UPDATE : Fox " News " does it again !
Labels Sanford as a " ( D ) " Democrat as he was admitting to affair !
Screenshot follows below ...
( hat - tip Kos )
This is not the first time for such an " accident " by Fox .
They did the same with Rep. Mark Foley ( R - FL ) after the revelations about his obscene text messages to under age Congressional pages , as The BRAD BLOG broke back in 2006 ...
FURTHER UPDATE : Media Matters reminds us of this similar gem as well ...
And RAW STORY has links to still more such " accidents " by our friends at Fox .
UPDATE 6/25/09 : Fox issues a rare apology for identifying Sanford as a Democrat .
Video at Media Matters .
For the record , they never apologized for Foley , despite having misidentified him as a " D " at least three times during O'Reilly 's primetime , the most watched on cable news .
As we reported at the time , Fox producers said " everyone knows " Foley is a Republican , so they " did n't feel it was necessary to run a specific on - air correction " .
In the mid-1960s , Bernard Madoff tapped money from Jewish businessmen at exclusive country clubs with the promise of steady guaranteed returns on their investments .
He then set his sights on Europe and Latin America , brokering deals with powerful hedge fund managers and feeder funds from Buenos Aires to Geneva .
Billions of dollars were channeled to Madoff ’s investment firm , and his feeders became fabulously wealthy .
The competition wondered how the man could produce such steady returns in good times and bad .
There were allegations that Madoff was “ front - running ” or operating a Ponzi scheme , which the SEC investigated several times over the last two decades .
But Madoff remained untouched until Dec. 11 , 2008 , when he admitted it was all “ one big lie . ” FRONTLINE unravels the story behind the world ’s first truly global Ponzi scheme — a deception that lasted longer , reached wider and cut deeper than any other business scandal in history .

Do you know ? :
It is the game Chips Challenge .
The object of Chip's Challenge is to help heroic Chip find all the computer chips he needs on one level so that he can plug into the cosmic computer socket and pass through the exit square to the next level .
Along the way you 've got to keep Chip safe from the many dangers of Melinda 's magical clubhouse .
Your job is to help him find the tools he 'll need to unlock doors , walk through fire , bridge water , avoid bombs , and find the correct paths .
Use the arrow keys on the numeric keypad or the mouse to move Chip around the magical clubhouse .
Each time you move Chip to a square with a tool on it , the tool becomes Chip 's ally .
For instance , when you move Chip to a square with a blue key on it , he can use the key to pass through a blue door .
The screen is divided into two windows : the Action window and the Information window .
The Action window is the inside of Melinda 's magical clubhouse , where you play the game .
The Information window , located to the right of the action window , has four displays .
The Level display shows the game level .
The Time display is a countdown clock to remind you how much time remains .
There is a time limit for most game levels .
The more complicated the level , the moretime you are allotted .
The less time you use , the higher your score .
The Chips Left display shows how many chips you need to find before you can pass to the next level .
Watch this display , as you do n't always need to collect every chip on a level .
On some levels you do n't even have to collect any chips , which means your big challenge is to just get out alive .
The inventory box , below the Chips Left display , holds the tools you 've picked up , such as keys , shoes , skates , and so on , to help Chip make it to the next level .
A hint box is displayed when you move Chip to a square with a question mark on it .
The hint box provides suggestions on how to make it through each level , from level 1 to level 8 .
Beyond the eighth level , however , only occasional hints are given .
To start a new game
From the Game menu , choose New Game , or press F2 .
Note : When you choose the New Game command , it returns you to level 1 , resets your score to zero , and erases all your passwords .
To restart an existing game
If you restart Chip 's Challenge after a short or long break , all you have to do is press the arrow keys or click the mouse and Chip is back in action .
Melinda remembers your score and all your passwords .
Note : Be sure not to choose the New Game command to restart an existing game or all your past achievements are lost .
To move Chip
On the numeric keypad , press the UP ARROW , DOWN ARROW , LEFT ARROW , OR RIGHT ARROW .
You can also use the mouse .
Just click the square you want Chip to go to , no matter how close or far away .
To get a hint
Move Chip to the question mark square .
Hints are given during the first eight levels , and only occasionally on subsequent levels .
To pause a game
From the Game menu , choose Pause , or press F3 .
When the game is paused , the countdown clock stops .
But to make life tougher for Chip , the playing surface is covered .
To resume play , choose Pause or press F3 again .
To restart play on the same level
From the Level menu , choose Restart , or press CTRL+R .
To go to the next level
From the Level menu , choose Next , or press CTRL+N .
If you have not already visited this level , you must give the password .
To go to the previous level
From the Level menu , choose Previous , or press CTRL+P .
To go to a specific level
1 From the Level menu , choose Go To .
The Go To Level dialog box is displayed .
2 Type the number of the level you want to go to and its password .
The password for a level is displayed when you begin that level .
If you have already visited a level , you can omit the password .
If you know the password , you can omit the level number .

Midnight Mysteries : Salem Witch Trials
With much ballyhooing , Bruce Riedel led a team that conducted the Obama administration ’s " review " of Afghan policy .
As is known , the team ’s deliberations produced a wonder of either naiveté or stupidity , or perhaps both : 21,000 more U.S. troops to control a country the size of Texas , and a logistical system running vital U.S. - NATO resupply lines through hostile territory in Pakistan and – with Russia ’s gleeful support for keeping America bleeding in Afghanistan – the Commonwealth of Independent States .
The question must be asked how a man as intelligent as Riedel came up with a plan that amounts to massively reinforcing failure .
The answer lies , I fear , in Riedel ’s eagerness to please Obama with a new plan and a deep faith in the rightness of U.S. interventionism .
Trying to please the president is a trait so common in some former senior CIA officials jockeying for political sinecures that it hardly comes as a surprise ; Riedel very effectively managed analysis on several Middle East issues during his Agency career .
What does surprise me , however , is Riedel ’s clear ignorance of his Obama - assigned task , Afghanistan .
Writing on the Brookings Institution Web site on April 30 , 2009 , Riedel bemoans the fact that America has not intervened more fully and aggressively in Afghanistan .
In an article titled " Afghanistan : What Is at Stake ? " Riedel writes ,
" Twice in the last quarter century the United States has squandered great victories achieved in Afghanistan by failing to follow up battlefield success with an enduring and resourced commitment to helping to build a stable government in Afghanistan . "
One wonders what Riedel is talking about .
The United States has never won a war in Afghanistan .
The war against the Red Army and the Afghan communists ( 1979 - 1992 ) was won by the Afghans – period .
U.S. arms supplies helped them kill Russians more quickly and effectively , but they , not we , won the war .
In the war that commenced in October 2001 , we won one battle – that for control of the Afghan cities – but since late March 2002 , we have been losing every step of the way .
To his credit , Riedel says we are losing the current war .
He also says " it is not yet lost . "
He is wrong ; we have lost .
Another , more important point on which Riedel is dead wrong is in his repetition of the exceedingly durable but completely incorrect urban legend that Washington and the West abandoned Afghanistan after the Red Army withdrew .
In the late 1980s , Riedel claims ,
" U.S. - supported Afghan mujahedin defeated the Soviet 40th Red Army [ sic ] . …
The mujahedin were badly divided , however , and quickly fell into civil war .
The United States could have led an international effort to restore order and rallied key players like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to try to end the conflict .
Instead , Afghanistan got virtually no attention from the White House or the Congress . "
Riedel ’s ignorance of what happened after the Red Army ’s withdrawal is almost breathtaking , but such a misrepresentation of reality is politically requisite if anyone is to believe the new - but - doomed Afghan policy approved by Obama has a chance to succeed .
One might have hoped that Riedel – who worked on Iraq in the years he is writing about – would have consulted one or more of his Afghan - experienced former colleagues for some factual background before taking up his pen .
But then again , the facts would get in the way of justifying more U.S. intervention in Afghanistan .
Riedel argues that a viable post - Soviet Afghan government failed because the " mujahedin were badly divided , " Western governments lost interest , and Washington did not seek Saudi and Pakistani involvement .
This is palpable nonsense .
The mujahedin were , are , and always will be " badly divided , " but they still beat the Soviet superpower – as they are on the verge of beating the American superpower – and there is no doubt they eventually would have worked out governing arrangements compatible with Afghan history and society .
The West tends to forget that the Afghans have been running their country for 2,000 years and have a bit more experience than we do in managing their tribal and ethnically diverse society .
From the perspective of Washington and its allies , the real post - Soviet trouble was that whatever regime the mujahedin built would not be the one we wanted ; namely , one that included none of the Afghans who actually fought and bled to drive out the Soviets .
Sadly , therefore , the U.S. government , many of its European allies ( especially the UK , France , and Germany ) , and various UN organizations intervened fully and dictatorially in post -Soviet Afghan politics , thereby preventing any sort of genuine Afghan attempt at self - determination .
And as they are today , the Saudis and Pakistanis were also fully involved in telling the Afghans what to do , and , just as today , their recommendations ran exactly counter to U.S. interests .
Notwithstanding Riedel ’s assertions , in the late 1980s and early 1990s U.S. , Western , and UN diplomats consistently tried to dictate to the Afghans what kind of government they should have .
That troika wanted to staff the new secular and centralized Kabul regime with Afghan technocrats ; secular Afghans who , like Hamid Karzai , spent the war safely in India , America , or Europe ; " Gucci " mujahedin who were nominally Islamic , received wartime aid , but did no fighting ; and even former members of the Afghan communist regime .
In other words , all were welcome to join the new Western - mandated Afghan government except those who wore beards , carried AK - 47s , were devoted Islamists , and fought to expel the Soviets .
In the immediate post - Soviet years , then , Washington spent tens of millions of dollars to try to form exactly the same type of strong and centralized Afghan government – the type of regime that historically causes war in Afghanistan – it is trying to form today .
And in a lethally ironic case of déjà vu , the father of current Afghan President Karzai – a far more honorable and competent man than his son – was one of the West ’s favorites , and he was guided by Zalmay Khalilzad , the same U.S. diplomat who has brought us the recent disasters in Kabul and Baghdad .
In addition , the talented U.S. ambassadors Robert and Phyllis Oakley and Peter Tomsen led numbers of U.S. and UK bureaucrats , contractors , and NGOs into the country to teach Afghans the West ’s democratic ways , as well as how to organize and administer national budgets , establish the rule of law , and create a strong central regime .
This wildly misplaced intervention went so far as to bring in teams of American lawyers and judges to teach the Afghans a Westernized judicial system to replace what we knew was all that silly old Islamic and tribal stuff .
In the end , the U.S. - led , late - 1980s democracy - building intervention in Afghanistan was all for naught , just as Obama ’s new Afghan policy will be .
The Afghans wanted no part of the secularism the U.S. - led West insisted on then , and they want none of what the U.S. - led coalition has on offer now .
While the Afghans will accept medical aid for their kids , electrical generators , and tools for increasing potable water supplies , they will utterly reject and fight measures aimed at eliminating the traditional role of tribalism and Islam in their society in the name of secular democracy .
Afghans , like all Muslims , make a clear distinction between the terms modernization and Westernization ; they are eager for the former but will fight the latter to the death .
For our future relations with the Islamic world , it is a fatal liability that we are so cocksure the two terms are synonyms .
One final point .
Riedel is a senior fellow at the aggressively pro-Israel Brookings Institution .
Is it just a coincidence that his very misleading article about the " need " for more and longer U.S. intervention in Afghanistan appears just a week after Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman identified Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Iraq as the three main threats to Israel ?
I think not , and that is why America will either be defeated or still fighting , bleeding , and losing in Afghanistan and Iraq by Inauguration Day 2013 .
LAWS prohibiting states and territories from reintroducing the death penalty are being seriously considered by the Rudd Government and could be introduced this parliamentary term .
The Herald understands the Attorney - General 's Department is looking at legislation that would incorporate into domestic laws Australia 's obligations under an international treaty , the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
The move comes amid growing pressure from Labor MPs who want Australia to take a more principled stand on the death penalty and send a strong signal to the region that it is serious about being an abolitionist country .
Concern is mounting about the fate of the three Australians from the so - called Bali nine on death row - Scott Rush , Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan .
They are yet to file motions in the Indonesian courts for their sentences to be reconsidered but will most likely do so later this year .
Caucus and a cross-party working group on the death penalty were briefed last month by one of the barristers working for Sukumaran and Chan , Julian McMahon .
This followed a briefing late last year by Rush 's barrister , Colin McDonald , QC .

The first European : Created from fragments of fossil , the face of our forbears 35,000 years ago
Dressed in a suit , this person would not look out of place in a busy street in a modern city .
The clay sculpture , however , portrays the face of the earliest known modern European - a man or woman who hunted deer and gathered fruit and herbs in ancient forests more than 35,000 years ago .
It was created by Richard Neave , one of Britain 's leading forensic scientists , using fossilised fragments of skull and jawbone found in a cave seven years ago .
The first modern European : Forensic artist Richard Neave reconstructed the face based on skull fragments from 35,000 years ago
His recreation offers a tantalising glimpse into life before the dawn of civilisation .
It also shows the close links between the first European settlers and their immediate African ancestors .
To sculpt the head , Mr Neave called on his years of experience recreating the appearance of murder victims as well as using careful measurements of bone .
It was made for the BBC2 series The Incredible Human Journey .
This will follow the evolution of humans from the cradle of Africa to the waves of migrations that saw Homo sapiens colonise the globe .
The head has taken pride of place on the desk of Alice Roberts , an anthropologist at Bristol University , who presents the programme .
' It 's really quite bizarre , ' she told Radio Times .
' I 'm a scientist and objective but I look at that face and think " Gosh , I 'm looking at the face of somebody from 40,000 years ago " and there 's something weirdly moving about that .
' Richard creates skulls of much more recent humans and he 's used to looking at differences between populations .
' He said the skull does n't look European or Asian or African .
It looks like a mixture of all of them .
' That 's probably what you 'd expect of someone among the earliest populations to come to Europe . '
Anthropologist Alice Roberts with the model : ' I look at that face and think " I 'm actually looking at the face of somebody from 40,000 years ago " ' , she says
The head is based on remains of one of the earliest known anatomically modern Europeans .
The lower jawbone was discovered by potholers in the Carpathian mountains in Romania in 2002 .
The rest of the fragments were found the following year .
The bones were carbon - dated to between 34,000 and 36,000 years ago when Europe was occupied by two species of human .
They were the Neanderthals , who had arrived from Africa tens of thousands of years earlier , and the more recent modern humans , also known as Cro-Magnons .
Although the skull is similar to a modern human head , it has a larger cranium , is more robust and has larger molars .
Although it is impossible to work out the skin colour of the prehistoric hunter , it is likely to have been darker than modern white Europeans .
Fossil experts are also unsure if the skull was male or female .
Many scientists believe that modern humans evolved in Africa 200,000 to 100,000 years ago .
Our ancestors left Africa around 60,000 years ago and migrated around the world , replacing other branches of the family tree which had left the continent earlier .
The earliest modern Europeans were far from primitive .
Living in huts and caves , they used stone tools and spears made from antlers , painted on the walls of their caves and made jewellery from shells .
The programme will be shown on BBC2 at 9.30 pm on May 10 .
* April same - store sales up 19.2 pct at Uniqlo
* Sales at cut -rate store g.u. up 70 pct LFL in April
* Warm weather helps drive up sales of summer items
( Adds details )
By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO , May 7 ( Reuters ) - Japan's Fast Retailing 9983.T said same - store sales at its casual - clothing stores chain Uniqlo and cut - price chain g.u. rose in April , with analysts expecting the company to comfortably meet its full - year forecasts .
Same - store sales at Uniqlo rose 19.2 percent in April as warm weather early in the month helped lift sales of summer items .
Like - for - like sales at g.u. rose 70 percent in April , having spiked by that much in March .
Few analysts doubt Fast Retailing will comfortably beat its own forecast for this business year .
However , many expect it to face growing challenges next year , as year - ago comparisons are raised by its own robust performance .
The g.u. chain , often seen as Uniqlo 's answer to Gap Inc's GPS .N Old Navy chain , is also enjoying bumper growth after the company introduced 990 yen ( $ 10 ) jeans , priced at about a quarter of those at Uniqlo .
The g.u. chain has 70 stores while Uniqlo has about 770 in Japan .
SINGLE WINNER
The warm weather boosted the sales of rival budget apparel chains to a lesser extent , Shimamura 8227 .
T reporting a 3.3 percent rise in same - store sales in April .
Department stores , hit hard by ongoing consumer trend to rein in spending to weather tough times , were even worse .
Japan ’s top three chains last week reported 9.5 percent to 14 percent drops in April sales .
“ During times of economic hardship , a winner tends to take all , as consumers flock to the chain that offers the best value , ” SMBC Friend Securities retail analyst Shun Tanaka said .
He and other analysts expect the company to beat its same - store sales forecast for the second half of the year , which ends in August .
Fast Retailing said it was expecting growth in such sales of just 2.3 percent after a hefty 12.9 rise in the first six months .
The analysts said Fast Retailing ’s strong sales are likely to drive up profit margin because it is not being pressed into marking down items to clear inventory .
“ But the challenge is the next business year , when it will face tough times , ” Tanaka said , citing higher year - ago comparisons .

This town tucked in the black - loam corner of northeastern Iowa has long been a bustling , polyglot place .
If it was a morning pastry you wanted , you could get it at a Somali - run coffee shop .
Other red - brick storefronts along Lawler Street , the main thoroughfare , specialized in Mexican or Guatemalan food .
Jewish kids attended school at their own yeshiva , while their parents bought matzo ball mix and gefilte fish at a kosher restaurant and grocery store .
A sign at the high school track and football field , set hard against rows of corn , cautioned youths about rollerblading or biking on the grounds – in English , Spanish , and Ukrainian .
But then federal immigration authorities raided the dominant business in town , a meat - processing plant , which employed almost half the area 's 2,300 residents , many of them undocumented workers .
Today , one year later , Postville is hanging on by a bib - overall thread .
The slaughterhouse is bankrupt .
Scores of homes have been vacated by the workers who were either deported or thrown out of jobs .
Retailers are shuttering businesses .
Most telling of all , the city council has declared the town a disaster area .
In many ways , Postville represents a classic tale of what can happen when a large employer in a small town runs into trouble .
It 's a story of how a government raid – however justified – has changed a town .
Now , as Postville tries to reinvent itself , it may hold lessons for other towns across the country .
" What happened did not happen overnight , and a recovery will not happen overnight , " says Maryn Olson , the head of the Postville Response Coalition , a group of business , church , and civic leaders working to save the town .
A NO - TRAFFIC-LIGHT
TOWN set in undulating dairy country , Postville was humming along in preraid times due mostly to the presence of Agriprocessors Inc. New York investor Aaron Rubashkin had purchased a shuttered Postville meatpacking plant in 1987 with plans to specialize in producing kosher chicken and beef .
By 2008 Agriprocessors , which was being run in Iowa by Mr. Rubashkin 's son Sholom , was processing 60,000 chickens and buying 500 cattle a day from area livestock producers .
It was the largest kosher meatpacker in the country , employing about 1,000 people .
Agriprocessors hired Jewish rabbis to kill each animal to kosher standards .
Further processing was conducted by local hires , and when that pool was tapped out , the company turned to immigrants from Ukraine , Russia , Somalia , Mexico , Israel , and most notably Guatemala .
An area first settled by German and other European immigrants ( Czech composer Anton Dvorak and his family spent summers in nearby Spillville ) suddenly found itself teeming with people from new lands .
Adjustments needed to be made , such as including more Spanish in schools and getting acquainted with Jewish customs .
Lawler Street , with all its ethnic storefronts , looked like a mini United Nations in a cornfield .
Then Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents , some 500 strong , descended on Postville on May 12 , 2008 , to arrest Agriprocessors workers they suspected of not having proper documents .
As helicopters thumped overhead , they rounded up 389 people .
It was the largest immigration raid in US history .
The plant foundered under the weight of the raid , and , by November , Agriprocessors declared bankruptcy .
It then closed , though a small portion of it has since reopened and is being run by a US Bankruptcy Court trustee .
Most of the illegal workers either accepted immediate deportation or pleaded guilty to immigration or document fraud charges , and , once they had served time , were sent home .
Several dozen immigrants , mostly women , were released to care for children .
They remain in Postville , but must wear electronic ankle bracelets so the government can monitor them .
Local churches and aid groups have taken up the plight of the undocumented workers who remain , offering food , clothing , housing , and help with lawyers .
Father Paul Ouderkirk of St. Bridget 's Roman Catholic Church estimates his congregation is dispensing $ 80,000 a month alone – money that has come in from across the country .
Operators of the plant are faring less well .
Sholom Rubashkin is awaiting federal trial on charges of bank fraud and violating immigration and packing - plant laws and regulations .
Several of his managers face immigration or document - alteration charges .
The state has also filed misdemeanor charges against Mr. Rubashkin , including for multiple alleged infractions of child - labor laws .
He has pleaded innocent to the charges .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version failed to note that Mr. Rubashkin was released on bail in January . ]
The ripple effects from the raid remain palpable in Postville – especially coming amid a virulent national recession .
The town will likely default on a federal loan it took out to expand its wastewater treatment plant .
Nearly 50 percent of the brick storefronts on the south edge of Lawler Street , as well as on adjoining Greene Street , lie vacant .
" The people , they do n't have any money right now , " says Elver Herrera , a Guatemalan who left his packing - plant job several years ago to run a bakery in downtown Postville .
He has watched many stores close and has now posted a " For Sale " sign in his window .
" I 'm not gonna make it , " says Mr. Herrera , who is married to an Iowan .
Few here seem to be giving up on Postville , though .
Far from it .
Bill Anderson exudes the kind of stoicism and resiliency that permeates farm country .
He has sold gasoline and tuned up cars on South Lawler for 46 years – well before Agriprocessors first took over the operation and even before another meat plant on the site closed in the 1980s .
" We got by , " he says with clipped finality .
" We 'll get by . "
A KEY QUESTION IS whether Agriprocessors will play any part of the town 's future .
Local officials believe it is operating at about one - third of capacity ( the bankruptcy court trustee , Joseph Sarachek , who 's overseeing the operation , could n't be reached for comment ) , which is n't enough to do much good for Postville .
Town officials hear about deals to sell it to Israeli investors , but they are moving on either way .
They 're inviting outside experts to plot ways to revive the town .
In April , representatives of Jewish Community Action ( JCA ) , of St. Paul , Minn. , and the Chicago - based Jewish Council on Urban Affairs visited Postville to offer help .
Both groups have worked here for several years .
" Jewish organizations ... have a special obligation to take action to improve conditions in this plant for all workers , and to strive for comprehensive immigration reform because we were once immigrants in this country , " says JCA head Vic Rosenthal , noting also how important the plant has been in supplying kosher food .
Others are suggesting ways to protect the workers and community if the plant fully resumes operations .
Russ Adams , of the Minneapolis - based Alliance for Metropolitan Stability , touts the virtues of " community benefit agreements . "
These forge pacts between citizens and corporations on issues such as fair labor and environmental practices .
Many people agree the plant would need to be run differently .
" It 's all about not getting taken a second time , " says the Rev. Stephen Brackett of St. Paul 's Lutheran Church .
" There are a lot of people who say that plant ruined this town . "
The town may , in fact , want to look beyond the meat business altogether .
Jeff Schott , a community affairs expert at the University of Iowa , is encouraging local officials to devise a " wish list " of where they want to be in five years – the types of jobs , parks , healthcare , and other services – and then work to attract businesses and retailers .
John Molinaro of the Aspen Institute believes Postville should avoid being " seduced " by industrial recruitment and encourage local entrepreneurialism – firms that build on any natural assets the town possesses .
Whatever direction the town takes , it will likely have to do it on its own .
The state chipped in $ 680,000 and sent two AmeriCorps volunteers to Postville after the raid .
But it 's still struggling to clean up from last summer 's floods in eastern Iowa .
That means much of the task of reinventing the town will fall on people like Maryn Olson , whose paper - cluttered desk sits in what used to be the Somali - run coffee shop .
The head of the Response Coalition feels the town is off to a good start .
But it 's just a start .
Still , she , like other locals , seems undaunted .
Kim Deering , who runs the Wishing Well flower and gift shop , may have put it best .
Postville , she says simply , was – and is – more than Agriprocessors . •

Most detailed map of nearby Universe completed
ANGLO - AUSTRALIAN OBSERVATORY NEWS RELEASE
Posted : April 6 , 2009
Researchers from Australia , the UK and the USA have just completed the most detailed survey of galaxies in the nearby Universe , which will reveal not only where the galaxies are but also where they are heading , how fast , and why .
The clustering pattern of about 100,000 nearby galaxies , revealed by the 6dF Galaxy Survey .
Each galaxy is shown as a dot .

Galaxies are tugged around by each other 's gravity .
By measuring the galaxies ' movements , the researchers can map the gravitational forces at work in the local Universe , and so show how matter , seen and unseen , is distributed .
" Light can be obscured , but you can't hide gravity , " said Dr. Heath Jones , lead scientist for the Six - Degree Field Galaxy Survey ( 6dFGS ) .
The 6dFGS was carried out with the 1.2-m UK Schmidt Telescope in eastern Australia , operated by the Anglo - Australian Observatory .
Broader and shallower than previous comparable surveys -- it covered twice as much as sky as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey -- it has recorded the positions of more than 110,000 galaxies over more than 80 % of the Southern sky , out to about two thousand million light - years from Earth ( a redshift of 0.15 ) .
The survey shows strings and clusters of nearby galaxies on large scales in unprecedented detail , and has revealed more than 500 voids � apparently empty areas of space with no galaxies .
The special aspect of this survey is that it will let the researchers disentangle two causes of galaxy movements .
As well as being pulled on by gravity , galaxies also ride along with the overall expansion of the Universe .
For about 10 % of their galaxies , the 6dFGS researchers will tease apart these two velocity components : the one associated with the Universe 's expansion , and the one representing a galaxy 's individual , " peculiar " , motion .
There have been previous dedicated peculiar - velocity surveys , but 6dFGS will provide more than five times more peculiar velocities that the largest of these surveys .
Calculating peculiar velocities is done by comparing the galaxy 's distance predicted by its redshift with its distance measured using the internal properties of the galaxy .
The technique depends on measuring the width of spectral lines in a galaxy , and doing this accurately needs a high - resolution spectrograph , such as the one purpose - built for this survey .
From conception to delivery , the 6dFGS has taken almost a decade .
It was made possible by a purpose - built spectrograph and robotic fiber positioner , the Six - Degree Field ( 6dF ) instrument , which allowed 150 spectra to be taken simultaneously .
The survey also took advantage of the UK Schmidt Telescope 's wide field of view -- 5.7 degrees , or 11 times the width of the full Moon -- which was key to the survey being able to cover 80 % of the Southern sky in a reasonable time .
The sample of galaxies was drawn mainly from the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog : that is , they were selected by their infrared light rather than optically selected .
Selecting galaxies by their near - infrared ( K band ) magnitudes avoids bias against galaxies that are currently forming few stars , and instead selects by total stellar mass .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
Twenty people were killed early Saturday after a suspected U.S. airstrike in northwest Pakistan , a intelligence official said .
The incident occurred in South Waziristan near the Afghan border when a drone dropped two missiles on a home , according to Pakistani intelligence officials .
The U.S. military in Afghanistan routinely offers no comment on reported cross - border strikes , which are normally launched from unmanned drones .
But the United States is the only country operating in the region known have the capability to launch missiles from drones , which are controlled remotely .
CNN 's Zein Basravi contributed to this report .

Do you like the demoscene ?
Or do you just like smaller , faster , or embedded code ?
Read on .
When I was 14 , I started learning how to program , for at least two reasons :
My dad could code , and he made some neat stuff , like a code - generating pentomino puzzle solver and a really tiny pop-up editor .
Because I really liked the demoscene .
Scratch that .
I still like the demoscene .
I mean , who else can make incredible 3D tube or lattice demos in a 256 - byte executable ?
Try them — both still run fine under Windows XP .
So I read diskmags and tutes to learn how to program the VGA hardware , push pixels to 0xA000:0000 , and use Mode X . Oh , and I learnt about sin and cos before I learnt at school — for basic 2D and 3D rotation .
Then there were effects : the fire effect , plasma , starfields , wormholes , etc , etc .
( Click on the piccy to the right to download some of my old source . )
Anyway , back from Second Reality to the real thing …
As I ’ve noted before , I ’m not exactly in favour of bloatware .
But in today ’s “ a GB here , a GB there ” world , is small still beautiful ?
I think so , for two reasons :
Embedded programming
In the embedded world , size still matters a lot .
Microcontrollers are getting bigger and faster , sure , but in electronic products there ’s often a place for the small ones ( say 64KB flash , 2KB RAM ) .
Just the other day , I cut our code size by 900 bytes , which was a significant percentage of the total — less code to download , test , and maintain .
And it ’s not only important for small micros , but also to limit download time and cost for in - field updates .
If you want to update code for 1000 units over a fairly slow and costly radio link , small is good .
Binary diffs or deltas are really good for this .
My brother Berwyn has developed a proof - of - concept binary diffing algorithm which is designed for tiny embedded systems — contact us if you ’re keen to hear more .
Binary diffing is n’t new , of course — bsdiff already does something similar for Firefox ’s updates , so you only need to download a small update .
But bsdiff does n’t work on small embedded systems , because it uses a compression program which requires a fair amount of RAM ( bzip2 ) .
To go fast , do less
Yep , as the guy said :
To go fast , do less .
And KISS .
Keeping it Short and Simple means less code to test , and if you ’re using basically the right approach and algorithm , it usually also means faster code .
And to follow my own advice , I ’m keeping this section short .
Conclusion
In a word , if you ’re a budding hacker , or the parent of a budding hacker , teach them that small is still beautiful .
And get ’em started with the demoscene .
There is still a pretty active ‘ scene community , and here are some starting points :

No doubt somebody at the RNC thought it would be a clever idea , since Nancy Pelosi is feuding with the CIA , to run an ad comparing Pelosi to a James Bond villainess up against the superspy -- as in Bond 's many screen - credit sequences wherein he blasts away at various villains .
You would think , somewhere , someone would have suggested that maybe having a sequence where we look at Pelosi down the barrel of a gun , hear shots fired , and then watch blood drip down our screens was n't exactly the smartest or most responsible way to
Jaysus .
What is it about right - wingers and their Pelosi assassination fantasies anyway .
Eliminationism much , ya think ?
[ H/t Chris Harris at Media Matters . ]
The goons at the Lomographic Society International — the people who brought the world the $ 20 Holga for $ 70 and monopolistic control over the distribution of the Lomo LC - A camera — have now added Worldwide Pinhole Photography
Day to the list of products and events they had nothing to do with creating that they ’ve claimed as their own .
The headline of their latest newsletter proclaims , “ THE LOMOGRAPHIC SOCIETY INTERNATIONAL PROUDLY PRESENTS THE WORLD PINHOLE DAY ” .
Um , no .
WPPD was started in 2001 .
As far as I know — and please correct me if I ’m wrong — none of the members of that year ’s coordinating team were affiliated with LSI .
Same with this year ’s roster .
Or any year in between .
So to the best of my knowledge , LSI does n’t present WPPD , proudly or otherwise , at all .
Granted , they do n’t use the exact same name , they call it “ World Pinhole Day ” , and the actual pinhole day event is called “ Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day ” , but they look same , and they just happen to fall on the same date .
Why would they do such a thing ?
Probably because it ’s a good way to sell more pinhole cameras .
They have a decent selection of horribly overpriced pinholes to choose from .
And that ’s fine .
But is it necessary to claim WPPD as their event , which is clearly a crock of shit , to do so ?
No .
They could have gotten behind the real Pinhole Day and promoted it to their mutual advantage instead of choosing this classically - LSI approach .
I urge you to think about the kind of company you ’re supporting when you buy from them ( to say nothing of the fact that you ’re almost certainly over - paying ) .
Here ’s where to get the pinhole cameras LSI sells , or equivalents , for less .
Prices are in US dollars .
PinHolga : $ 60 from LSI , $ 21.95 from holgamods
35 mm PinHolga : I do n’t know , but you can convert most $ 1 plastic 35 mm cameras yourself , or you can make or buy a pinhole cap for your 35 mm , medium format , or digital SLR .
Bulldog Large Format Camera : $ 325 from LSI , $ 302.43 from camerabellows.com ( as of today ’s exchange rate , and that includes VAT , which should n’t apply to US orders ) .
And , you can find used , no -assembly - required 4×5 cameras for less .
You can try the Buy / Sell board on the Large Format Photography Forum , the Cameras & Lenses classifieds on APUG , or the auction sites .
Zero Image Zero 2000 ( “ Zero Pinhole 120 ” ) : $ 165 from LSI , $ 93 from the manufacturer
Zero Image Zero 135 ( “ Zero Pinhole 35 ” ) : $ 140 from LSI , $ 93 from the manufacturer

Sharan DIY Pinhole : $ 40 from LSI , free if you download and print the plans for the original Dirkon paper pinhole camera , or you can grab the plans for Nick Dvoracek ‘s Populist cut - out pinhole camera ( PDF link ) .
They ’re all paper cameras that you have to put together yourself .
SmileyCam : $ 25 from LSI , $ 23 from Justin Quinnell , who makes them .
Or just make one yourself , which should be very easy .
And it ’s not a pinhole , but you can get a SplitCam $ 11.95 from the awesome American Science & Surplus instead of paying LSI $ 25 .
Why else do n’t I like the Lomographic Society ?
Shitty products at high prices : their flagship , the LC - A , is a piece of junk .
The lens is unique and awesome , but the camera that surrounds it sucks .
They did n’t build them , but they locked down the supply and charge a premium .
The first LC - A I ordered from them operated in bulb mode no matter what .
The shutter button on the replacement fell off after running less than five rolls through it .
I have n’t used an LC - A + and therefore ca n’t comment on it .
Their Colorsplash and Fisheye cameras have some of the worst build quality I ’ve ever seen .
Yes , they work .
But for how long ?
I think my $ 1.50 Lex 35 crapcams are actually built slightly better .
Their Hipshot was my first camera bag .
The seams are unraveling and the Velcro on the camera compartments does n’t stick — even when I press them together carefully — which leaves anything you put in them likely to fly out and break as you move .
Terrible customer support :
When I received the broken LC - A , I sent them several emails over the course of I think three weeks and never got a single response .
Finally I called them , sent back the whole package , and got only a replacement camera back .
I guess they kept the rest of the kit .
Monopolistic and bullying business practices : they secured world - wide exclusive distribution rights to the LC - A from the factory ( ca n’t charge $ 200 - 250 for a $ 50 camera if there ’s any competition ! ) and then went after anyone else who sold them , regardless of origin .
For example , Lomo Joe is a guy who lived in St. Petersburg , Russia .
If you did n’t want to pay the extortionate Lomo Society price for an LC - A , he ’d go buy one in a local store and send it to you .
Check out the threatening letter LSI president Wolfgang Stranzinger sent him .
Getting people to love getting ripped off : this one ’s almost difficult not to find evidence of .
People drool all over themselves for anything “ Lomo ” ( including things whose only connection to Lomo is that they ’re sold by LSI , like Holgas and Horizons ) and just ca n’t wait to be taken advantage of by paying hugely inflated prices and having their work published in books that LSI profits from without offering the photographers any compensation .
I guess getting screwed by a marketing company is its own reward .
Zwischenlandung mit Folgen Harald Neuber
US - kritischer Journalist an Bord : Air -France - Flug wurde Nutzung des US - Luftraums verwehrt .
Nun droht ein Rechtsstreit .
Nachdem die US - Behörden einem Linienflug der französischen Gesellschaft Air France am 19 .
April die Nutzung des US - Luftraums verweigerten , prüft das Unternehmen nun rechtliche Schritte gegen die USA .
Die Sperrung des Luftraums war dem Piloten des Fluges AF 438 während einer Reise von Paris nach Mexiko - Stadt mitgeteilt und damit begründet worden , dass sich an Bord eine für die USA unerwünschte Person befindet .
Dabei handelte es sich um den französisch - kolumbianischen Journalisten und Buchautor Hernando Calvo Ospina .
Wie die Air -France - Leitung in der vergangenen Woche mitteilte , prüften Juristen im Auftrag der Fluggesellschaft eine Klage .
Unterstützung sucht Air France dabei bei der französischen Luftfahrtbehörde Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile .
Der gebürtige Kolumbianer Calvo Ospina war von seinem Wohnort Paris nach Mitteamerika unterwegs .
Er reiste im Auftrag der französischen Wochenzeitung Le Monde diplomatique , um eine Reportage über Nicaragua zu erstellen .
Dass sein Name auf einer US - Antiterrorliste steht , wusste er nicht .
„ Wenn eine solche Liste existiert , dann sollte sie auch nur die Namen anerkannter Terroristen enthalten “ , sagte Calvo Ospina im Gespräch mit Telepolis .
Seine Verfolgung durch die US - Behörden führt der Autor mehrerer Bücher über die US - Geheimdienste und das kubanische Exil in den USA auf seine journalistische Arbeit zurück : „ Ich konnte mir denken , dass diese Arbeit eines Tages Probleme verursachen könnte . “
In einem Beitrag für das spanischsprachige Internetportal Rebelion.org hatte Calvo Ospina die Vorkommnisse während des Fluges geschildert .
Fünf Stunden vor Ankunft in Mexiko - Stadt hätte der Pilot die Passagiere über die Entscheidung der US - Behörden informiert .
Wenig später habe er angekündigt , dass die Maschine in Fort de France auf der Karibikinsel Martinique landen werde , um aufzutanken .
Von Martinique aus sei die Reise nach Mexiko - Stadt fortgesetzt worden .
Während des Weiterfluges habe ihn der Kopilot über die Hintergründe informiert .
„ Wir gingen in den hinteren Teil des Fliegers “ , erinnert sich der Publizist : „ Als er mir offenbarte , dass ich `verantwortlich´ sei , war ich verblüfft .
Ich fragte ihn sofort , ob er mich für einen Terroristen halte .
Er schüttelte den Kopf , die Sache schien ihm ehrlich Leid zu tun . “
Später habe ihm eine Stewardess versichert , dass ihr so etwas in elf Jahren in ihrem Beruf nicht widerfahren sei .
In seinem letzten Buch Colombia , laboratorio de embrujos hatte Calvo Ospina scharfe Kritik an einer Operation ( Ecuador und Kolumbien erneut auf Konfrontationskurs ) der kolumbianischen Armee im vergangenen Jahr geübt .
Spezialtruppen waren in der Nacht zum 1 .
März 2008 von Kolumbien aus auf ecuadorianisches Territorium vorgedrungen , um einen der Anführer der FARC - Guerilla , Raúl Reyes , zu töten .
Mit dieser Operation , deren Vorbereitung mutmaßlich von den in der Region stationierten US - Truppen unterstützt worden war , sei eine politische Lösung des Konfliktes nachhaltig sabotiert worden .
Nach einem kurzen Verhör durch die mexikanischen Behörden konnte Calvo Ospina nach Nicaragua weiterreisen .
„ Die Zeitung Le Monde diplomatique hat mir eine neue Rückreiseroute organisiert , die nicht über Mexiko – und deswegen auch nicht über die USA – führt “ , sagte er zu Telepolis : „ So entkomme ich zwei Übeln : Den US - Behörden und der Schweinegrippe . “
Palm Pre Jailbreak : Sprint activation edited out
The Pre hacking continues , with what seems to be the first reported Jailbreak of the new Palm handset .
Developer Steve Troughton - Smith was in the US for Apple ’s WWDC 2009 but was tempted into buying the Palm Pre ; since he lives in Ireland , far beyond the reaches of Sprint ’s EVDO Rev.
A connection , he did the obvious thing and crafted his own hacked webOS firmware bypassing Sprint ’s activation process .
The process was reportedly pretty straightforward , with Palm ’s javascript - based webOS proving amenable to some light hacking .
After bypassing the activation , Steve coded up a second hacked webOS ROM which installed the usual Sprint apps .
He now has a Pre with full access to WiFi and Bluetooth , meaning that with the exception of cellular calls and data he ’s free to use the rest of its functionality .
Steve intends to use it as a developer device ; ironically , he ’s the person behind the popular Lights Off game currently available to download in the Apple App Store .

The Federal Opposition is demanding to know whether a motor vehicle dealer who gave Prime Minister Kevin Rudd a free car has been given special favours by his office .
Mr Rudd was given a car , registration and road side assistance by Queensland car dealer John Grant .
The freebies were declared to Parliament .
Treasury official Godwin Grech told a parliamentary hearing the Prime Minister 's Office and the Treasurer 's Office made representations to him on behalf of a car dealer about the Government 's multi-million dollar trust set up to support dealerships .
The trust , known as OzCar , offers finance to car dealerships that have been affected by the global credit crunch .
Mr Grech would not confirm if the calls were about Mr Grant , but said they were straightforward inquiries .
" Both offices became aware of a situation facing a particular car dealer and they simply wanted - as you would expect a normal ministerial office to do - refer it to the relevant part of the bureaucracy to help the ... car dealer , " he said .
Liberal Senator Eric Abetz told the Senate hearing Mr Rudd should reveal if that car dealer is John Grant .
" Was there a declaration in those professional representations that there was at least the possibility of a perception of conflict of interest ? " he asked .
" I think we all know what the answer is and that the answer is ' no ' . "
The Opposition used Question Time to demand answers from the Prime Minister , with leader Malcolm Turnbull asking " What do you have to hide ? " .
But Mr Rudd who told Parliament he knew nothing about it , and accused the Opposition of enganging in " politics of smear " .
Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan told Parliament Mr Grant did contact his office , but the contact was straightforward and above board .
" It 's an entirely normal thing that Members of Parliament or car dealers would contact the Treasury , which is establishing and putting in place this vehicle [ OzCar ] , " he said .
" It is the case that Mr Grant did make representations to my office and he was referred on to the SPV , just like everybody else .
" I have no idea what the outcome of that was . "
The restriction is frustrating for Sikh officers , says Kashmira Singh Mann .
Sikh police want bulletproof turbans to be developed so they can serve as firearms officers and deal with public order , a newly - formed body says .
The British Sikh Police Association says
Sikh officers cannot currently do such jobs , as their religion prohibits removing turbans to wear helmets .
But the organisation 's chairman says he now intends to push for more research on suitable ballistic turban material .
The Home Office said each force needed to ensure religions were accommodated .
The British Sikh Police Association , set up last month to give Sikh officers across the UK an " officially recognised voice " , said it wanted its members to play a full role in the police .
' Frustration ' Sgt Kashmira Singh Mann , chairman of the association , told the BBC News website bulletproof turbans would allow such officers to abide by religious traditions as well as participate in all areas of the police service .
" We are looking at the issue because it stops Sikh officers serving in all roles , " said the Thames Valley Police officer who is based in Slough , Berkshire .
" It is a frustration for them - we see our colleagues putting their lives on the line and we want to serve alongside them . "
He said research had already begun to find a ballistic material for turbans , but that it would need to be passed by the Home Office before it could be used .
It is down to individual forces to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the religion of individual officers
Home Office " We have put some feelers out and talks are on the agenda , " he added .
The new association aims to support Sikh members of the service - said to number some 2,000 - and help forces to develop strategies to recruit , retain and progress Sikh officers and staff .
The Metropolitan Police Service and West Midlands Police have the largest number of Sikh staff .
West Midlands
Police last year denied spending £ 100,000 on trying to adapt safety helmets to fit over turbans .
However , it said it had been working to solve the headgear issue , which it described as " problematic " .
On the issue of bulletproof turbans , a Home Office spokeswoman said the government wanted a police service that " reflected the diverse communities it served " .
" The more closely the police service reflects the people it serves , the more effectively it can protect and support that community , " she said .
" It is down to individual forces to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the religion of individual officers , " she added .

Major dislocations are coming .
Tremendous disruptions are coming .
Price discontinuities are coming .
Price chart patterns might be rendered useless soon .
Last week , the case for a grand Paradigm Shift was made , covering many elements in order to paint a mosaic .
Taken in isolation , any one point is important in its own right , but not enough to convince of a structural change .
Taken in entirety , the many points create a full picture that is more easily recognized .
The ruinous events of the Wall Street banks last September and October surely served as an extreme event loaded with profound disruption .
The Chinese have proceeded with a transition to yuan - based domestic banking , with an installation of yuan swap facilities around the world , with an ASEAN regional fund again supplied by yuan for flexible purposes , with permission granted to two Hong Kong banks to sell yuan - based bonds , with an admitted rise in significant gold bullion reserves , and with continued verbal battles over legitimacy of the USDollar as the global reserve currency .
These Chinese initiatives in recent weeks , occurring rapidly , are serving as a collective extreme event with the potential for profound disruption .
A gold - backed yuan currency would surely cause massive disruption in a climax merger of events .
The barter system set up between Russia and Europe will bypass the US $ - based settlement system , as will the barter system set up between Russia and China .
The avoidance of contract settlement in USDollars would result in extreme disruption to the global banking system .
The creditor nations are plotting to organize and launch alternative currencies , maybe to fortify existing currencies ( like the euro or yuan or ruble ) with a gold component , maybe also with a crude oil component .
A challenge to the USDollar by asset - backed currencies would result in extreme disruption to the global banking system .
The hidden nitroglycerine to the disruptions is the Russian military , and any pledges of support for nations attempted to force systemic changes .
These are just some important examples of change agents .
All Paradigm Shifts result in extreme disruption .
That is the essence of Paradigm Shifts .
The entire table changes , like its shape , its seats , its location , even who sits at the table , and in particular who sits at the head of the table .
Big disruptions are to come from the COMEX pit of corruption , the central nexus for controlling illicitly the price structure for gold , the USDollar , and the USTreasury Bonds .
The COMEX in all likelihood is the weakest link in the US - UK chain of corrupted financial markets .
For many months my view has been that gold fights the political battles , while silver gathers more than its share of rewards and spoils .
Gold has a long history of experience fighting grand battles .
It can be placed in dungeons , but not for more than a couple decades .
The rot in financial systems without golden foundations forces gold to the surface !
THE HITMEN COMETH
It has come to my attention that several private parties have accepted contract assignments to neuter the COMEX and London Metals Exchange , to render ruin to its gold market .
That bears repeating from the rooftops .
MUTLIPLE HIRED HITMEN HAVE ASSIGNMENTS TO KILL THE COMEX GOLD MARKET .
That is the lynchpin to control the USDollar , the USTreasurys , and the corrupt mechanisms used by the New York and London syndicates .
Their clear criminal behavior is beyond the reach of law enforcement , but they are not beyond the reach of hitmen .
The USDollar has been in violation of the US Constitution since 1971 , perpetuated by a renegade series of administrations .
The global creditors for the USTreasury Bonds are so angry at the past suffered losses , the prospect of deep future losses , and the corruption laced throughout the US financial system , that they have hired third parties to kill off the US $ - gold platforms , to destroy the burdensome banking ballast dominated by protected entrenched fraud experts , to lay waste to the vehicles used by the US - UK bond trafficking syndicate totally saturated with corruption , dishonesty , and collusion , replete with greed , totally absent conscience .
They have systemically been dismantling the COMEX pillars and levers over the last several months , quietly and without fanfare , surely without publicity .
If gold investors knew of their actions , they would become much bolder .
Some want the bankers in their gunsights not to be warned .
They await their fate with the Financial Grim Reaper .
Their executions will be as swift as brutal .
The HITMEN have been hired , with highly lucrative contracts and wide berth in methods to be put to use .
Their assigned task is to castrate the levered family jewels from some of the major players who illegally keep the gold price and silver price artificially low .
The targeted victims know their awaited fate , and are presently defecating in their skivvies .
A short list of banks facing the firing squad is already known , details for Hat Trick Letter members .
Some detailed speculation will be devoted to the June HTL reports , since too controversial .
This will be an evolving story , with new chapters soon written .
The executions will be sudden .
The missing US - UK levers will be immediate .
Since last autumn , the global powers have aligned against Wall Street , even if the central bankers have supported it .
If one wants to destroy a building , then weaken its pillars , cut a few support beams , then rush in a crowd of people , and wait for a turbulent storm .
In the case of the COMEX , the wicked players will crowd the corrupted building .
They will sink into ruin and then oblivion .
They might become objects of mockery when they make noises from prison .
If lucky , they will join Ken Lay from Enron fame in a remote Caribbean island where other favored operators live a secluded life , but a life nonetheless , complete with plenty of sunshine , fresh air , beaches , bikinis , and sailboats , but no intrusive cameras .
Please , do not disturb the quasi - dead !
The financial cartel dominated by the United States and United Kingdom is soon to suffer some serious blows .
The list of their financial crimes is as magnificent as it is long .
Its list of victims is as prominent as it is long .
The harbored resentment is great by many global players .
They waited patiently for the Obama Admin to install a new group , but the old group remains due to a revolving door from the same smoky club , dominated by Goldman Sachs once more .
Their influence , if not bribery , of the USCongress is in continuation , sufficient for unwanted obsequious approval .
The regulatory agencies are from the same encrusted chambers replete with stench .
The Coup d�Etat of the USGovt financial offices has not changed with Obama , who sounds like a refreshing leader but who is actually a marionette under control by those who selected him , favored him with publicity , then enabled his election .
Nothing has changed except the rhetoric of change and the pace on the path to bankruptcy for a few icon firms like General Motors and Chrysler , if not the desperate cries from the 50 states suffering from insolvency .
More prominent failures will follow , since nothing has been remedied .
The channeled funds directed to Wall Street firms continue unabated .
The bread crumbs to Main Street and the people continue unabated .
Even the war continues unabated .
Forget not that Marie Antoinette once said � Let them eat cake� before the French Revolution and the Storming of the Bastille .
Today , the Bastille is the entire USEconomy where insolvent Americans are stuck .
Some might wonder what was the turning point that resulted in hired hitmen to be under contract against certain US financial markets .
Some might say the failures of Lehman Brothers , American Intl Group , and Fannie Mae .
Not so !
In my opinion , it was the invasion in the South Osettia region of Georgia in August 2008 .
The events around Georgia , with the United States Military deeply involved , along with a certain tiny mischievous ally nation , lit a fuse that set off a chain of events .
In time , events led to orders given by high level powers , for the US fraud kings on Wall Street to swallow the medicine no later than first thing Monday morning on September 15th .
When the Jackass inquired as to the nature of the urgency leading into that understood stated deadline date , no answer was given .
The guess of the Bank For Intl Settlements was submitted by me , and it was confirmed .
Other sources , the USTreasury Bond creditors , also applied the pressure , it was told .
Rumor was thick that death threats had been delivered to certain Wall Street executives , such as Paulson .
Thus the pressure passed on to the USCongress for passage of T.A.R.P. funds .
The disbursement of those funds have not been made public partly because Wall Street ( read Goldman Sachs ) does not want the US people to be aware of payoffs for bond fraud under death threats .
Also , the Congressional Inspector has cited a few dozen recommendations for criminal fraud investigations of the same T.A.R.P. funds .
The US financial sector has become a den of vipers , no longer the bastion of gentlemen , but rather of syndicate bosses .
COMEX STRESS NEAR A BREAKING POINT Sources from GATA ( the Gold Anti-Trust Action committee ) report growing distress for participants in the COMEX gold contracts , where a commercial party is very short and in deep trouble .
They have sold more gold bullion than they can deliver .
They are likely one of the big banks who violate the law with impunity , with USGovt sanctioned protection .
By that is meant they routinely do not post 90 % of the metal as collateral that they illegally sell .
This is naked shorting by any other name .
There are reports of grave concern over the upcoming June gold option expiration .
If too many deliveries are ordered , then the commercial shorts would be under stress for exposure for naked shorting .
They will eventually be caught in a bind and default on contracts .
The important loaded monthly contracts are March , June , September , and December .
The COMEX has tried to limit the ability of buyers to take delivery , running them around in circles , and entangling them in red tape , all clearly restraint of trade endorsed by the USGovt .
Such rules are not in effect for cotton or soybeans or crude oil or pork bellies .
After all , a financial crime syndicate has taken control of the USGovt , ever since Robert Rubin took charge at the USDept Treasury in 1992 .
His major project was to gut the nation of its gold , for the private profit of his friends .
Recall Rubin came from Goldman Sachs .
Rubin was the author of the Strong Dollar Policy which brought ruin to the nation .
Hey , just my opinion !
Background inventory strain has come from unexpected sources .
The Germans have demanded that gold bullion held in US custodial accounts be returned to their owners , with physical gold shipped back to Germany .
The Dubai bankers have demanded that gold bullion held in London custodial accounts be returned to their owners , with physical gold shipped back to the United Arab Emirates .
They are following the hired German counsel .
In all likelihood , neither US nor London sources are in possession of all the gold held in those custodial accounts , since at least some of it probably was improperly leased .
By that is meant without owner permission or knowledge .
So an uproar could come soon with charges of gold bullion theft , or at least failure of fiduciary responsibility .
Theft is a simpler description .
China is the biggest gold producer in the world now , but none of its output is directed to the open market .
Russia is a significant gold producer also , but none of its output is directed to the open market either .
A near default occurred in early April from a close call to Deutsche Bank on 850 thousand ounces of gold .
The tarnished bankers at D - Bank dug up over a million ounces on the quick from the ready Euro Central Bank mine shifts in the nick of time .
Never ignore the basic fact that COMEX lies through its teeth about the gold bullion in its vaults , since audits do not occur , some is leased ( replaced by paper certificates ) , and some is committed in some fashion to very wealthy parties ( unavailable ) .
Far less gold bullion rests in COMEX vaults than is advertised .
All signals point to serious strain in COMEX gold supply .
FEEDERS FOR GOLD FULLY LOADED
Two important feeder systems continue to be USDollar weakness and USTreasury Bond weakness .
More important than these is the systematic ruin of the major global currencies generally , but a convenient chart is not offered to track it .
Just note the near 0 % official rates dictated by the failed franchised Politburos known as central banks in most countries , or the movement toward 0 % .
The USDollar has broken below important support at 81 .
Expect it to fall further after more dithering .
The long - term USTreasury Note has suffered a fast rising surge in its bond yield .
Its target from different perspectives is 4.1 % , and right quick .
These two highly favorable charts will power the gold price to new highs very soon .
Nobody knows how soon , but soon .
Rarely does one see both the USDollar and USTreasurys fall in value simultaneously .
They are now , and will provide a jet assist to gold , which is held back only by COMEX corruption .
Their illicit maneuvers are more obvious and desperate with each passing week .
Someday their actions might even be on the news .
The imminent Standard & Poors debt downgrade of the UKGilt ( bonds from British Govt ) hit the credit market last week like a bolt of lightning .
My belief is that it might have short - circuited the US - UK financial foundation , and burned out some major circuit boards .
The US and UK share Third World finance characteristics .
If a Fourth World existed , the US would merit it .
The gold price is on the verge of a breakout to new nominal highs .
The chart demands it .
It needs only a trigger , in a land where potential triggers dot the charred landscape .
A gold event will be unavoidable .
Its chronic strain has derived from the extreme disparities between the physical market mired in shortage , versus the paper market with unlimited supply .
The tail is wagging the dog here , as it has been for years , soon to end .
The silver price will easily recover to the 17 level in a flash .
It has already surpassed the February high .
It is loading up for the next little surge to resistance that awaits at the 17 - 19 range .
The potential sling shot momentum boost for silver will be powerful , enough to send its price to 30 with ease .
Think pendulum .
NOW FACTOR IN DISRUPTIVE EVENTS , THE PRICE DISLOCATIONS , AND THE OVER - ARCHING PARADIGM SHIFT IN PROGRESS .
THE GOLD PRICE COULD REACH 1300 SUDDENLY .
WITH EXTREME CONTROVERSY FROM COMEX , LIKE DELIVERY DEFAULTS , PUBLICIZED CORRUPTION , AND EVEN FRAUD INDICTMENTS , THE GOLD PRICE COULD OVER - RUN THE 1300 TARGET AND HEAD FOR 1500 AND BEYOND .
SILVER COULD AS A RESULT FOLLOW ITS WARRIOR BROTHER , HEAD PAST 20 IN A FLASH , AND PURSUE 30 EASILY .
Little attention has been given lately to one of the most reliable time - tested forward indicators of the gold price .
The ratio of the 10 - year USTreasury Note yield to the 2 - year USTreasury Bill yield has always been highly reliable in predicting a move in the gold price .
The simple chart of bond yields versus maturity years is known better as the Treasury Yield Curve .
The ratio is more amenable to chart analysis .
A breakout in the Treasury Yield Ratio is in progress .
All benefits from the mid-March monetization announcement have vanished .
If the 2 - year bond yield remains near 1 % , where it appears stuck , then the breakout target would indicate that the 10 - year bond yield is heading to 4.1 % at least .
Yet another method targets 4.1 % in the long bond yield .
The presented ratio contains information on the future prospect of price inflation , in a reliable contrast of time perspectives .
Knuckleheads who insist on pounding the Deflation Tables might want to check this indicator , and look at the crude oil price .
It is $ 63 per barrel , not the $ 20 - 25 predicted by these lost troopers .
Yo Mish Bro , can you spare me a deflating dime ?
The strict definition of money is useless anymore .
The Shadow Banking system is an actual part of the real world , which you do NOT count .
To the fools , dolts , and morons out there who cling to notions of recovery and Green Shoots , bless your heart .
Hope has clouded your minds .
Once more you believe the liars and purveyors of propaganda , after being nearly fatally burned .
You must believe in the Easter Bunny , Santa Claus , and the Tooth Fairy .
You should not be in charge of investment funds , but rather of crayon supply cabinets and Beanie Baby collector items .
The Case Shiller housing price index this week reported a 19.1 % annual decline in 1Q2009 from Q1 last year .
Foreclosures in April were up 32 % over last year , as the nightmare continues .
That is 1 in 374 homes with mortgages in America in some process of foreclosure .
A relentless decline in home prices erases household wealth , and the source of consumer spending .
Consumer confidence is ephemeral and baseless .
The mortgage rate has just gone above the pre-March levels , when the USFed announced they would monetize $ 1050 billion in both USTreasury Bonds and USAgency Mortgage Bonds .
The benefit has been erased .
Today�s underwater mortgage is tomorrow�s foreclosure , made worse by job losses .
The FDIC this week reported a 25 % rise in non-current loans in 1Q2009 from Q4 of last year .
Greater bank losses will come , much like floods follow hurricanes .
And lastly , give credit to the USGovt statrats in their busy laboratories .
They decided to ramp up the Q2 Gross Domestic Product by including all USGovt rescue funds for the big banks , including the diverse funds from the many liquidity facilities .
All those funds will go directly into the GDP for Q2 as a special line item .
Expect a miraculous economic recovery in the second quarter , based in vapor .
The stock rally since March was based in accounting fraud .
These are true American innovations , but too bad they are not exportable !
They are not , since they have no value .

Last minute intervention from the White House , under intense pressure from Israel , led to the surprise US abstention in last night 's UN security council vote calling for a ceasefire in Gaza , according to diplomatic sources .
The resolution calling for a truce was passed by a vote of 14 - 0 , but the US abstention will weaken its impact in Israel , where signals sent from Washington are taken very seriously and where an election is approaching .
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , issued a statement this morning saying that the security council resolution was " not practical " and that the Gaza offensive would continue .
" The [ Israeli military ] will continue to act in order to protect the citizens of Israel and will achieve the goals that were set for the operation , " said a statement issued by Olmert 's media adviser .
Israeli air strikes continued overnight and this morning , while Hamas launched at least 14 rockets on Fridaytoday .
America 's volte - face over the UN resoltion stunned British and the French diplomats as the US had helped draft its text .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , had fiercely defended the draft in the face of heavy lobbying from Israel which was adamant it would not accept any proposal that treated it on an equal footing with Hamas , and might limit its right of self - defence against Hamas rockets .
In the drafting process , it was France that had been most resistant to a resolution , reportedly with the aim of buying time for President Nicolas Sarkozy 's diplomacy , in tandem with Egypt , to bear fruit on the ground .
Once the French had been convinced , the text was negotiated with Arab League foreign ministers in New York , who wanted tougher language but who were ultimately satisfied that the ceasefire call was in the form of a resolution , which is legally binding in theory , although it was not an enforceable resolution under chapter 7 of the UN charter .
The ministers had rejected an earlier proposal of issuing the ceasefire call in the form of weaker security council presidential statement .
The text of the resolution " stresses the urgency of and calls for an immediate , durable and fully respected cease - fire , leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza " .
It also calls for UN member states " to intensify efforts to provide arrangements and guarantees in Gaza in order to sustain a durable ceasefire and calm , including to prevent illicit trafficking in arms and ammunition and to ensure the sustained re-opening " of border crossings .
The US change of mind came at the last moment , as a result of White House intervention following a call from Olmert .
Rice was overridden and in the final vote , the US abstained .
In her remarks afterwards , Rice made clear she backed the resolution , saying the US " fully supports " its goals , text and objectives .
She said the US had abstained because Washington " thought it important to see the outcomes of the Egyptian mediation … in order to see what this resolution might have been supporting . "
However , that was an argument the US had made when the text was drafted .
The incident marks the latest in a long line of issues on which the White House has overruled the state department , both under Rice and her predecessor , Colin Powell .
The hard line taken in support of Israel by George Bush and his vice - president , Dick Cheney , has been maintained until the last days of the administration .
A senior European diplomat said that US abstention still represented a diplomatic victory for UN consensus .
" Before they were going to veto , so to go from veto to a vote for a resolution was maybe too far , " the diplomat said .
Britain 's foreign secretary , David Miliband , who had delayed his return from New York to draft the text , said it would help bolster peace efforts in the region .
" We are all very conscious that peace is made on the ground while resolutions are written in the United Nations , " he said .
" Our job here is to support the efforts for peace on the ground and to help turn the good words on paper into changes on the ground that are desperately needed . "
COLLEGE PARK , Ga. , April 28 ( UPI ) --
School officials said Tuesday they were investigating an incident in which a 6 - year - old allegedly brought a loaded handgun to a Georgia elementary school .
Administrators at Heritage Elementary in College Park told WSB - TV , Atlanta , the kindergartner brought a " small handgun " to the school Monday , showing it to another student who reported the weapon .

Fulton County Sheriff 's officials could n't tell the broadcaster how many bullets were in the weapon , but they said they do n't believe the child meant any harm .
The youngster was reportedly taken to the principal 's office and then sent home , where he was to remain until a school disciplinary tribunal can be held within 10 days .
School resource officers told WSB they were looking into how the child obtained the gun .
If we tell you the next laser in the works by the National Nuclear Security Administration ( NNSA ) will be the size of a football stadium and will have 192 individual beams , each about 40 centimeters square , beaming into a spot about one - half millimeter in diameter at the center of its 10 meter diameter target chamber , delivering huge amounts of energy with extreme precision in billionths of a second , what will you think ?
You 'll think the residents of Alderaan had better start packing suitcases , right Housed at the Department of Energy 's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , the National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) is also expected to allow scientists to achieve fusion ignition in the laboratory , obtaining more energy from the target than is provided by the laser .
The completion of NIF opens the door to scientific advancement and discovery that promises to enhance our national security , could help break America 's dependence on foreign oil , and will lead to new breakthroughs in the worlds of astrophysics , materials science and many other scientific disciplines .
" Completion of the National Ignition Facility is a true milestone that will make America safer and more energy independent by opening new avenues of scientific advancement and discovery , " said NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino .
" NIF will be a cornerstone of a critical national security mission , ensuring the continuing reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile without underground nuclear testing , while also providing a path to explore the frontiers of basic science , and potential technologies for energy independence .
" NIF is a critical part of NNSA 's mission of maintaining the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent without conducting nuclear testing .
The United States has not deployed a new nuclear weapon in over 20 years , nor conducted an underground nuclear test since 1992 .
Instead , scientists at the NNSA maintain the warheads in the stockpile well beyond their original life by using sophisticated supercomputers and facilities that test the safety , security and reliability of U.S. weapons in NNSA laboratories .
With NIF , scientists will be able to evaluate key scientific assumptions in current computer models , obtain previously unavailable data on how materials behave at temperatures and pressures like those in the center of a star , and help validate NNSA 's supercomputer simulations by comparing code predictions against observations from laboratory experiments .

Diagnostic instruments will be attached to the round hatches .
Photo montage by Jacqueline McBrideBecause of its groundbreaking advance in technology , NIF also has the potential to produce breakthroughs in fields beyond national security .
It may help advance fusion energy technology , which could be an element of making the United States energy independent .
It could also help scientists better understand the makeup of stars
It could also help scientists better understand the makeup of stars and giant planets both within and outside our solar system .
NIF has already produced historic scientific advances .
Earlier this month , NIF became the first fusion laser in the world to break the megajoule barrier ( a megajoule is the energy consumed by 10,000 100 - watt light bulbs in one second ) by delivering 1.1 million joules of ultraviolet energy to the center of its target chamber - more than 25 times more energy than the previous record - holder .
Established by Congress in 2000 , NNSA is a separately organized agency within the U.S. Department of Energy responsible for enhancing national security through the military application of nuclear science .
NNSA maintains and enhances the safety , security , reliability and performance of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing ; works to reduce global danger from weapons of mass destruction ; provides the U.S. Navy with safe and effective nuclear propulsion ; and responds to nuclear and radiological emergencies in the United States and abroad .
Founded in 1952 , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has a mission to ensure national security and to apply science and technology to the important issues of our time .
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is managed by Lawrence Livermore National Security , LLC , for the U.S. Department of Energy ’s National Nuclear Security .
Former NASA astronaut Lisa M. Nowak participates in an exercise in the systems engineering simulator at Johnson Space Center for her STS - 121 mission in 2006 .
An attorneyfor former astronaut Lisa Nowak filed a motion Monday in Orange - Osceola CircuitCourt , seeking sanctions against the state for failing to turn over evidence .
On Feb . 5 , 2007 , ColleenShipman accusedNowak of stalking her at Orlando International Airport , following her toher car , and then squirting pepper - spray inside the car as she tried to getinto the car .
Both women were vying for the affections of then - astronautWilliam Oefelein .
The evidence in question isa report by Greater Orlando Aviation Authority emergency response workers , inwhich a paramedic states that Shipman " denied any direct contact with thepepper spray and was not experiencing any burning sensations or any medicalproblems . "
Nowak 's attorney , DonaldLykkebak , complained that this information has been known to the prosecutionfor more than two years , but the prosecution failed to give him a copy .
" The police made amountain out of a molehill in this case , and now we have learned there wasnever a molehill to start with , " Lykkebak said .
" It is also clearthat the State ( either directly or constructively ) had possession or control ofthe evidence that tends to negate the guilt of the defense , but failed tocomply with the rules in mandatorily disclosing it to the defense . "
" I was gonna start tocall 9 - 1 - 1 for her , ' cause she really looked freaked out , " Shipman toldinvestigators , " I was looking down to plug my phone in , ' cause it reallywas dying , and when I looked back up at her , she started spraying me withsomething . "
When an investigator askedShipman if the spray got into her eyes , she answered , " I do n't think itactually hit my eyeball . "
After that , Shipman droveto the exit lane , where an attendant gave her wet paper towels to wipe hereyes .
She also complained of a burning sensation on her skin .
Nowak was charged withattempted kidnapping , battery and attempted burglary with assault .
Nowak and Oefelein both were firedby NASA following the incident .
Randy Means , a spokesmanfor the Orange - Osceola State Attorney 's Office , said motions arguing thatprosecutors failed to turn over discovery are common and often unsuccessful .
He did not comment on themotion 's specifics , saying his office will argue its case in court .
Shipman 's attorney , KeplerFunk , said Monday he had just received the six - page motion , and did not want tocomment until he had read all of it and talked with Shipman .
No hearing has been set onthe motion .

Rush starts , I think , to suggest that the caller is n’t really who he says he is , and by the end seems to allow that the guy may be a Republican , but not much of one .
The truth is we do n’t know who the guy is .
Could be who he claims to be , and could be a dirty hippie librul having some sport with the GOP leadership .
It does n’t matter , though .
The real lesson is in Rush ’s response to the charges .
Put simply :
If you disagree with Rush , it ’s “ sour grapes . ”
If you disagree with Rush , you ’ve been “ brainwashed . ”
People who oppose torture are “ stupid ” and “ ignorant . ”
If you do n’t agree with Rush , you “ do n’t know diddly - squat . ”
If you disagree with Rush , “ you ’re no Republican at all . ”
The new Republican leadership has drawn a line in the sand .

Yesterday the Lotto 6/49 jackpot was estimated at 49 million dollars .
This jackpot was so unusually high , that its size was mentioned on the evening news last night .
A quick calculation showed that the expected value of one lottery ticket was more than $ 3.50 , assuming that I can avoid picking the same numbers as someone else .
Given that a ticket only costs $ 2 , it seemed like the smart move was to go out and buy a lottery ticket .
I bought a lottery ticked yesterday .
I did not win the lottery .
In fact , I got zero numbers correct .
Still , I thought it was a good investment .
After all , the expected value was positive .
However , after some discussion with a few skeptical friends , I decided to check with our pal , the Kelly criterion .
Knowing when to play the lottery is relatively clear .
You play when the expected value of a ticket is more than the cost .
The Kelly criterion tells you how much to play by calculating what fraction of your bankroll you should bet when the odds are in your favour .
Generally , betting more than twice the Kelly fraction will eventually lead to gambler ’s ruin , even if the odds are in your favour .
So last night , after the draw , I did the calculation of what fraction of my bankroll I should bet .
This number is small .
This number is very small .
This number is so small , a better question to ask is , “ how large should my bankroll be before one $ 2 lottery ticket is the optimal investment to make ? ”
Assuming that the big jackpot is the sole payout , and assuming you will not share that jackpot , then for one $ 2 Lotto 6/49 ticket to be the optimal investment , your bankroll ought to be about 65 million dollars .
I feared the Kelly fraction would be small , but this was smaller than I expected .
I found an article on the internet that came to similar conclusion about the Powerball lottery in the United States .
In that case you ought to be a billionaire before you buy a Powerball ticket .
There is a nice chart at the end of that article that plots the bankroll needed to play at a given jackpot level .
Below I generated similar plots for the bankroll needed to buy one $ 2 Lotto 6/49 ticket at various jackpot levels .
Below is the bankroll needed to buy one $ 1 Lottario ticket at various jackpot levels .
Notice that if the Lotto 6/49 jackpot is below about $ 28 million , you should never play , and if the Lottario jackpot is below about $ 4 million you should not play it .
In these cases , the expect value of a lottery ticket is less than the price of the ticket .
So far , I have been ignoring the other prizes that are available for matching some of the numbers .
These prizes will increase the Kelly fraction and decrease the bankroll needed before you should play .
Unfortunately , it is hard to estimate the value of these prizes beforehand because most of them are based on the number of tickets sold .
Using the published prize numbers from yesterday ’s drawing , I calculated that you only need a bankroll of about 29 million dollars to play the Lotto 6/49 at yesterday ’s jackpot values .
Although I have made several simplifying assumptions , the general conclusion appears to be that you should not play the lottery until you are a millionaire .

4 - Mexico's central bank cuts rates , eyes Fed swaps Published : 22 Mar 2009 17:14:07 PST
* Central bank cuts benchmark interest rate 75 bps
* Cut aimed at boosting flagging economic growth
* Central bank : Likely will activate
Fed swap line soon
* Bank's Ortiz sees slump bottoming in 2nd - half '09 ( Recasts ; adds central banker 's comments , analyst's quote )
MEXICO CITY , March 20 - Mexico's central bank went on the offensive to counter a sharp economic downturn on Friday , slashing interest rates and pledging to activate a line of credit with the U.S. Federal Reserve .
The central bank lowered its key interest rate by 75 basis points to 6.75 percent , surprising investors who had expected a repeat of a tepid 25 basis - point cut ordered in February .
Mexico's exports have collapsed as U.S. consumers buy fewer cars , televisions and other products made in Mexican factories , which have laid off hundreds of thousands of workers .
The bank hopes lower borrowing costs will stem some of that bleeding .
The bank also toned down its concerns about inflation , which is running near a seven - year high , and suggested that it was planning more interest - rate cuts .
" The direction is clear " for monetary policy , Central Bank Gov. Guillermo Ortiz said in a radio interview , adding that the slowing economy was lowering inflation pressures significantly .
Mexico slowed the pace of its rate cuts last month after a 50 - basis - point reduction in January as it worried that a steep fall in the peso 's value was fueling inflation .
It repeated those concerns on Friday in its monthly monetary policy statement , but noted that market turbulence had eased recently .
" The central bank has woken up to the reality that the economy is so weak that its worries about inflation right now were a mistake , " said Pedro Tuesta , an economist at 4 Cast consultancy .
PESO'S HEALTH A CONCERN
The bank said the Mexican economy would contract during the first quarter at a similar pace to the 1.6 percent contraction seen during the fourth quarter of last year .
Mexico's peso has lost around 30 percent of its value against the dollar since a high reached last August amid growing pessimism that the U.S. downturn is driving Mexico into its deepest recession since 1995 .
In a move aimed at boosting the peso , Ortiz said Mexico would probably activate its $ 30 billion line of credit with the Fed soon to help Mexican companies refinance their debt .
In a separate interview on Mexican television , Ortiz said Mexico 's economy will continue to weaken during the first half of this year .
Asked when it would hit bottom , Ortiz said he expected " in the second half of the year . "
Finance Minister Agustin Carstens told Mexico's Televisa network that he would like to see the battered peso back below 14 per dollar .
" Below 14 would be an acceptable level , " Carstens said .
Ortiz and Carstens spoke with Televisa at an annual banking convention in the Pacific beach resort of Acapulco .
Mexico's Deputy Finance Minister Alejandro Werner said on Thursday that Mexico 's economy could shrink as much as 1.9 percent in 2009 -- a gloomier outlook than previous government predictions of a contraction of up to 1.0 pct .

What 's better than two chainsaws on a stick ?
Two chainsaws on a stick attached to a motorcycle .
The trailer introduces Dead Rising 2 protagonist Chuck Greene , who fills in for Dead Rising 's main character Frank West this time around .
Chuck is stuck in a grand Fortune City casino ( viva Las Vegas , baby ! ) with a bunch of shambling , mindless undead .
What 's a man to do - other than wreak zombie havoc , of course .
Chuck Greene seems to be a man of many tastes and many talents .
He expresses his sports enthusiast side by taking a baseball bat and swinging for the fences .
He gets in touch with his inner sensitive musician by grabbing an electric guitar ... and swinging for the fences .
He exhibits his love for social drinking by ... well , okay , we only see him drinking out of the fruity - looking cocktail , but that does n't mean he could n't kill a zombie with it if he tried really hard .
More interestingly , though , seems to be Chuck 's " Handyman " skills , which appear to grant him the ability to make makeshift weapons - by , say , taping chainsaws to the end of a stick .
That could be interesting .
On another note : Frank West , Chuck Greene ...
I 'm predicting that Dead Rising 3's protagonist will be named something along the lines of " Jack Fox " or something .
gorgeous video is a compilation of shots taken with a Canon EOS - 5D every 20 seconds over about nine hours at a star party in Fort Davis , Texas .

Some specifics :
The Canon was equipped with a fisheye lens ( an EF 15 mm f /2.8 lens ) and powered with an external battery to capture all that goodness .
The more interesting part is the replacement anti-alias filter the photographer , William Castleman , used : The Canon 's stock AA filter blocks out certain red wavelengths to achieve a " more desirable " skin tone , but if it 's replaced with a filter that lets those wavelengths in , you 've got yourself a camera capable of shooting a galaxy , as seen here , even if we can't see it with the naked eye .

In our last bit of World Science Festival coverage , we discussed how inflation has produced an expanding , inhabitable universe .
That still leaves the question of why that universe seems to be filled with strange stuff like virtual particles and dark energy .
A different panel tackled that question and , in true quantum fashion , the session that described the contents of the universe came before the one that described its creation .
The session , which was moderated by radio host John Hockenberry , started out with a historical perspective on the fabric of the universe from Cambridge 's John Barrow .
Barrow described various views of whether it might be possible for a space to exist that was devoid of the sorts of matter we 're familiar with .
Reactions to the prospects , from the time of Aristotle onwards , were mixed , but they were primarily based on philosophical grounds .
Things really did n't get close to our modern conception of a vacuum — one with states that could change over time — until the time of James Clerk Maxwell .
The advent of quantum mechanics finally made the description and study of vacuum states a quantitative science .
The panel discussion featured Paul Davies , George Ellis , and Frank Wilczek .
The latter described how quantum mechanics changed our view of what constitutes a vacuum by analogy : imagine you 're an intelligent fish .
You 'd probably develop physics that are appropriate for your environment , which is water .
What quantum mechanics has done , Wilczek suggested , is show us what sort of physics operates once you do the equivalent of taking the water away .
What 's left , in the case of our universe , is space that is n't really empty — instead , it 's filled with quantum fields ( notably the Higgs field ) and virtual particles that pop briefly into existence before being annihilated by collisions with their antiparticle counterparts .
The striking thing about this , in contrast to the multiverse , is that we actually have evidence for the existence of these vacuum fields and virtual particles .
The clearest the authors described comes in the form of the Casimir effect , in which two plates are brought close to each other in a vacuum .
Their proximity excludes the existence of some of the quantum fields in the space in between them , leaving that area , in effect , more empty than the vacuum outside the plates .
The net result is a pressure that drives the plates together , and that force has been experimentally verified .
That led to another key point : the vacuum that persists in empty areas of the universe is actually more energetically favorable than space that 's devoid of Higgs fields and virtual particles .
In short , if you somehow devised an experiment that could clear these things out , they 'd spontaneously re-form .
So , empty space is n't really empty as we might understand it , but it 's a lot easier to have that stuff there than having space that was closer to our traditional conception of empty .
As an aside , someone pointed out that the Casimir effect can apparently be used to describe the thermal decay of black holes through the emission of Hawking radiation .
I 'd always understood that to happen through the formation of virtual particle - antiparticle pairs on either side of the event horizon and , indeed , one of the panelists brought that up .
But it turns out that Paul Davies hates that way of conceptualizing things , as he indicated that the area inside the event horizon is too small for this to be a reasonable probability event ( although I may have gotten that wrong — things were moving rather quickly there ) .
The focus on nothing also took a familiar experiment and turned it on its head .
Brookhaven 's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider had always been presented as a way of generating a quark - gluon plasma in order to examine its behavior .
But Wilczek pointed out that as the plasma evaporates , researchers might be able to glimpse a different form of nothing that 's been left behind , if only briefly ( before our mundane bit of nothing returns ) .
As Davies put it , " finding nothing is not the same as not finding anything . "
At the same time , it 's clear that what we know about nothing does n't explain everything .
When asked about the apparent directionality of time , Wilczek responded by saying , " it 's remarkable how well we 've done by ignoring all that stuff . "
It 's also had nothing to say about String Theory which , " has n't made significant contact with empirical reality yet . "
Still , it made for quite an entertaining time , and the panelists were happy to stay and field questions from the audience afterwards .

Staff at Goldman
Sachs staff can look forward to the biggest bonus payouts in the firm 's 140 - year history after a spectacular first half of the year , sparking concern that the big investment banks which survived the credit crunch will derail financial regulation reforms .
A lack of competition and a surge in revenues from trading foreign currency , bonds and fixed - income products has sent profits at Goldman Sachs soaring , according to insiders at the firm .
Staff in London were briefed last week on the banking and securities company 's prospects and told they could look forward to bumper bonuses .
Figures next month detailing the firm 's second - quarter earnings are expected to show a further jump in profits .
Warren Buffett , who bought $ 5bn of the company 's shares in January , has already made a $ 1bn gain on his investment .
Organic VS Non-organic
Yes , there are people who actually argue that conventionally grown food is as nutritious as organically grown food .?
And as the popularity of organic foods increases , so does the debate .?
Well , the debate over whether organic food is healthier than conventionally grown food may be coming to an end , according to results from the largest study of it ’s kind into organic food .
The four - year , European - Union - funded 25 million dollar study found that :
* Organic fruit and vegetables contain up to 40 percent more antioxidants
* Organic produce had higher levels of beneficial minerals like iron and zinc
* Milk from organic herds contained up to 90 percent more antioxidants
The researchers obtained their results after growing fruit and vegetables , and raising cattle , on adjacent organic and non-organic sites .
Using sound on your website is n't always a good idea .
In fact , it annoys people more often than not .
This is probably caused by the enormous amount of web sites containing crappy sounds .
The right use of sound though , can enhance the user experience .
So if you want to do it anyway , here 's a list of 10 tips to make the experience as pleasant as possible :
Hire a sound designer
This is a good one to start with .
If you do n't know much about sound design , hire someone who does , preferably a person with experience in user - interface sound design .
He / she will ( hopefully ) already know how to include all tips on this list .
No background music
A lot of people are listening to music while browsing the web .
Do n't interrupt them by playing music on your website .
For some sites the use of music might enhance the overall experience , like web / sound - art and some specific sound - related web sites , but do n't do it without warning your visitor ( see tip 3 ) .
If you really want to give your website a continuous soundtrack , consider using a background atmosphere ( see tip 4 ) .
No auto - play
If you decide to use music , do n't have it start without the visitors ' permission .
If you ever opened an auto - playing MySpace page in a new browser tab for later review , you know what I 'm talking about .
And provide a mute - button : if a user does n't like the sound and there 's no way to turn it off , he / she will leave your website .
Try a background atmosphere
If you keep it simple and quiet , this might work .
Make a field recording at a location representative of your website and play it in the background at a low volume , like in this example .
Unobtrusive interface sounds
Adding sounds to user - interface items can absolutely enhance the usability of your site .
Try to keep these sounds unobtrusive in a way that a user can still hear them , even while listening to music , but without being disturbing while browsing in a quiet environment .
Keep sounds short
A good way to prevent sounds from becoming annoying is by keeping them short .
Imagine navigating a website with a second - long sound playing for every link your mouse cursor touches , that would n't be a pleasant experience , would it ?
Use the right frequencies
The human ear is most sensitive to sounds between 1kHz and 5kHz , so if you want people to hear the sounds , even on crappy laptop speakers set to low volumes , focus on this frequency range .
Add extra functionality
Do it right or do n't do it at all .
If you decide to use sound on your website you can give it extra functionality , more than just providing auditive feedback .
Variations in timbre and pitch of the sounds can be used to tell the user more about the menu or the page he / she is browsing .
Make sound and design match
Try to create sounds which match the design of your site as close as possible .
If your design is rather futuristic , it would be strange to use very natural or recognizable instrumental sounds .
In this case abstract electronic sounds would most probably complement the graphic design much better .
Care about the overall user experience
Do n't just add sounds to your website because you think it 's cool .
Ask yourself what it means to the user , and how it will improve the overall user experience .
If you do n't find a clear answer to these questions , do n't do it .
Most internet users still prefer web sites to be silent .
Be precautious , do n't act like you do n't care .
Do you know of a website with good sound design ?
Have you ever made sounds for the web ?
Do you have anything to add to this list ?
Please tell us by leaving a comment .
You know Tron Guy , that chubby embarrassment in a Lycra suit ?

Seriously , this guy owns a private plane .
To be fair , he made most of his money via his day job as a computer programmer , not via his night job as a poster child for a complete lack of self - awareness .

Toro and Kuro , of Japanese fame , recently caught up with Shadow of the Colossus and ICO director and lead designer , Fumito Ueda .
The two characters talk with Ueda about his humble beginnings , his future projects , and even how Team ICO got the name , ICO .
At the beginning of the interview , Toro and Kuro show us some of Ueda ’s history , such as his start at Warp on Enemy Zero , and then his decision to join SCE in 1997 , which allowed him to work on ICO and Shadow of the Colossus .
They then ask Ueda how he starts designing a videogame .
He said it usually has something to do with an image video , which he explains is a video that shows a final image of the game .
Ueda then shares that he tries to make his games look completely different than any other titles on the market , as his goal is to help his titles stand out .
Moving on , Kuro asks Ueda to share the meaning behind ICO .
“ ICO ’s title comes from ICON , ” Ueda simply replied .
He then elaborates on Shadow of the Colossus ’ early development , which was originally an online game .
In the end though , due to the network environment and the specialties of his team , Shadow of the Colossus become an offline only title .
And finally , Kuro and Toro ask about Ueda ’s upcoming project ( for which you can see screenshots here , and the trailer here ) .
Though , Ueda says only the following : that the project is in production , it ’s a PS3 title , and that it may be announced “ very soon ” .

Teen who auctioned her virginity for £ 8,000 may lose half ... because prostitutes in Germany are taxed at 50 % of earnings
Student Alina Percea auctioned off her virginity to the highest bidder on a German website - but now she may lose half her earnings to taxes
Tax authorities in Germany are poised to claim 50 per cent of the money that a teenage student earned for ' auctioning ' her virginity because they claim it was ' tantamount to prostitution ' .
Romanian - born Alina Percea , who is a student in Germany , was paid £ 8,800 in cash for a weekend of sex with the Italian businessman after she auctioned her virginity online .
But tax officials in Berlin regard the 18 - year - old 's act as ' nothing more than prostitution ' .
Prostitution is legal in Germany - but it is heavily taxed .
' It is not a moral standpoint but a fiscal one , ' an official said .
' Prostitution is not an illegal act in Germany , but not paying tax on earned money is .
' Consequently we are assessing her case and it looks likely she will have to pay around half of the sum she gained . '
The Romanian - born computer studies student 's visa allows her to work in Germany for 90 days - even as a prostitute .
One tax expert said : ' Even if she was taxed as a purveyor of erotic moments , or whatever she wants to call what she did , she would have to pay tax on it .
Prostitution is merely a means for the bureaucrats to pin her down for a claim .
' She would have been better off keeping quiet about this strange transaction . '
It also emerged that , because Alina earned so much in such a short time , she may even be liable for a hefty VAT bill too .
VAT in Germany works out to 19 per cent , meaning the sale of her virginity could land her with just over £ 3,000 in the end .
' When we have hard figures then we can make an accurate assessment , ' said a German inland revenue spokesman .
Alina , who studies in Mannheim , told how a 45 - year - old Italian businessman took her virginity with unprotected sex at a luxury Venetian hotel .
' I liked the man and got on with him well .
He did n't look 45 , and he seemed much younger .
' We spoke in English as I can't speak Italian and he can't speak Romanian .
He paid me a lot of compliments throughout the day , and he was very funny and charming .
We got on very well , and I was pleased he'd won , ' said Alina .
' We kissed , then undressed each other .
I 'd never done that before , so I was nervous .
He laid me on the bed and started kissing my body , then we had sex .
I was attracted to him , so I enjoyed it , even though it was quite painful .
' We only had sex once , then fell asleep .
Next morning , we had breakfast together like any other couple , and I took the morning - after pill .
He told me he'd like to see me again , and I agreed .
' I hope to see the man again - and next time I wo n't make him pay , ' she added .

In the year since I have been writing this column , readers have sent in many questions about organic foods .
With the White House and the U.S. Department of Agriculture planting organic gardens , these questions have become more urgent .
Q: What is the difference between " 100 % organic " and " organic " ?
A : Organic has a precise meaning under the USDA 's organic program .
Certified 100 % Organic means that all the ingredients in a product have been grown or raised according to the USDA 's organic standards , which are the rules for producing foods labeled organic .
Certified Organic requires that 95 to 99 percent of the ingredients follow the rules .
What , exactly , are those rules ?
Summarizing what 's in hundreds of pages in the Federal Register :
-- Plants cannot be grown with synthetic pesticides , herbicides , fertilizers , genetic modification , irradiation or sewage sludge .
-- Animals must be raised exclusively on organic feed , have access to the outdoors , and cannot be given antimicrobial drugs or hormones .
-- Producers will be inspected to make sure these practices are being followed to the letter .
Q: How do we know " organic " truly reflects our beliefs ?
A : I am guessing this question refers to the spirit of organics .
In the 1920s , the British botanist Albert Howard learned from observing farmers in India that human health depends on growing foods sustainably .
Indian farmers taught him the importance of protecting soil nutrients through composted manure , crop rotation and appropriate cultivation , and using biological pest controls .
Later , these methods were called " organic . "
But USDA organic rules do not say a word about sustainability .
This gap occurred as a result of the history of the organic standards ( as I recount in " What to Eat " ) , but also as a result of the USDA 's inherent conflicts of interest .
The USDA 's main job is to promote industrial agriculture .
Organics , the USDA says , are just different , not better .
Alas , the USDA has not always been a loving home for the organic program .
Q: Do food companies use the word " organic " in the same way they use " health " ?
A : USDA organic rules are about the letter of the law , not its spirit .
Food marketers , however , take advantage of public perceptions that " organic " implies spirit - sustainability and better nutrition .
Companies that follow the rules can legitimately market highly processed foods as organic , taking advantage of their health aura to command higher prices .
No wonder so many big food companies have bought organic product lines ( see links.sfgate.com /ZHKJ ) .
Yes , organic junk food is free of synthetic pesticides , but the foods still have calories .
As I like to put it , an organic junk food is still a junk food .
Q: Which is worse : eating nonorganic produce full of pesticides or not eating produce at all ?
A : Research demonstrates substantial health benefits from eating fruits and vegetables .
Although I wish we had more definitive research , these benefits appear to greatly outweigh any risks of pesticides .
If you want to compromise , you can save your organic dollars for the foods most likely to be high in pesticides .
These , according to the Environmental Working Group ( ewg.org ) , are peaches , nectarines , apples , bell peppers , strawberries , cherries , pears , raspberries , imported grapes , celery , potatoes and spinach .
In contrast , foods that you peel - onions , peas , bananas , sweet corn and tropical fruits , for example - tend to be low in pesticides .
Q: Is organic food nutritionally worth its higher cost ?
A : Foods grown on sustainable soils ought to contain higher levels of nutrients - and some studies show that they do - but organic certification does not require higher nutritional values .
Without testing , I 'd be hard - pressed to know whether the organic foods I 'm buying really are nutritionally better .
The main point of organics is production methods , and these require hand labor and careful management , both of which come at a higher cost .
If you believe , as I do , that growing foods according to organic practices is better for the environment , then paying more is worth it if you can afford to .
Q: Are n't organics elitist ?
People can't buy organic foods if they are n't available at an affordable price .
A : I once heard Eric Schlosser answer a similar question aimed at his book , " Fast Food Nation . "
He pointed out that social movements have to begin somewhere and that several began with elites but ended up helping the poor and disenfranchised - the civil rights , environmental and women 's movements , for example .
I would add the organic movement to this list .
It has already forced mainstream food producers to start cutting down on pesticides and to raise farm animals more humanely .
As the supply of organic foods increases , and the Wal - Marts of the world sell more of them , organics should become more democratic .
But please do n't blame organic producers for the high prices .
Until the latest farm bill , which has a small provision for promotion of organic agriculture , organic farmers received not one break from the federal government .
In contrast , the producers of corn , soybeans , wheat and cotton continue to get $ 20 billion or so a year in farm subsidies .
Industrial agriculture also benefits from federally administered marketing programs and from cozy relationships with congressional committees and the USDA .
In contrast , the USDA considers fruits and vegetables " specialty crops . "
This kind of food politics shows up as higher prices in the grocery store .
Dealing with the elitism implied by the higher cost of organics means doing something about income inequities .
If we want elected representatives to care more about public health than corporate health , let 's work to remove the corruption from election campaign contributions .
If Congress were less beholden to corporations , we might be able to create a system that paid farmers and farm workers decently and sold organic foods at prices that everyone could afford .
The organic gardens at the White House and USDA send an important signal that the way we grow food makes a difference .
Let 's hope they also symbolize a new era in agricultural policies , one that unites the letter and spirit of the organic movement .
Research finds that guys have trouble reading non-verbal cues and often mistake a friendly smile to mean sexual interest .
Can two people have sex and still remain " just friends ? "
A recent study found that 60 percent of college students have been in a " friends with benefits " relationship , but that the possibility for romantic feelings — and a lack of communication — can complicate such an arrangement .
That may seem fairly obvious .
But the study , published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior , focused on why college students have these relationships at all .
Researchers from Wayne State University and Michigan State University asked 125 undergraduates why they would or would n't have sex with a friend , and what the advantages or disadvantages would be .
Two - thirds of participants said they had been in a " friends with benefits " relationship , and 36 percent said they currently were in one .
The main advantage of such a relationship was " no commitment " ( reported by 59.7 percent of participants ) , which was followed closely by " have sex " ( 55.6 percent ) .
More than half of those who had sex with a friend said they had engaged in all forms of sex ; 22.7 percent said they had intercourse only , while 8 percent said they did everything but have intercourse .
" [ The relationships ] were perceived as providing a relatively safe and convenient environment for recreational sex , " write Melissa A. Bisson and Timothy R. Levine , the study ’s lead researchers .
The biggest reported disadvantage of this recreational sex was the possibility that feelings would develop ( 65.3 percent ) .
Other worries included " harm friendship " ( 28.2 percent ) and " cause negative emotions " ( 27.4 percent ) .
Concern over pregnancy and STDs , listed as " negative consequences of sex , " came in at only 9.7 percent .
The second part of the study asked 90 college students — all of whom had been in at least one " friends with benefits " relationship — what sorts of questions came up once they began sleeping with their friend , and how they went about answering those questions .
While approximately half admitted to having questions of uncertainty in the relationship , 84.4 percent said they never initiated any discussion ; furthermore , 73.3 percent said there was no ground - rules negotiation involved .
The findings hardly indicate that people have evolved to the point where " friends with benefits " relationships will replace traditional romantic couplings , Levine tells LiveScience .
" Romantic relationships have always been around , " he said .
Recreational sex " really requires either effective birth control or women to be economically independent or both to be viable , and both are relatively recent in human evolution . "

PARIS  The American Civil Liberties Union may not often see eye to eye with the American Center for Democracy , a research group with neoconservative credentials .
But the two organizations are united on at least one thing : their distaste for British libel laws , which they say are being exploited to suppress free speech in Britain and beyond .
British courts have always been friendlier to libel claimants than their American counterparts .
Until recently that did not matter much to American authors or publishers .
But now the Internet makes anything published in the United States almost immediately available in Britain , too .
Some free - speech advocates in the United States say that so - called libel tourists  people with little connection to Britain  are using the global - distribution argument to justify suing for libel there .
London has gained a reputation as the libel capital of the world .
Saudi businessmen have sued there to complain about American reports that they engaged in terrorist financing ; Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs have sued in Britain over accusations of unsavory business activities ; and Hollywood celebrities have gone to London to seek redress over reports of wayward kisses .
Clyde Barrow
O utlaw Clyde Chesnut Barrow , the partner - in - crime of Bonnie Parker , was born March 24 , 1909 , near Telico , Texas .
Both were ambushed and shot to death by law enforcement officers on May 23 , 1934 .
Clyde 's father , Henry Barrow , moved his family to Dallas in 1922 .
Four years later , Clyde was arrested for the first time on a charge of auto theft .
Undeterred , Barrow next committed a series of Dallas - area robberies over the next four years .
Soon after meeting Bonnie in 1930 , Barrow was jailed for burglary in Waco .
He soon escaped using a handgun Bonnie had slipped past the guards .
He was caught a week later in Ohio and sentenced to fourteen years hard labor in the Texas State pen .
Barrow was paroled in February 1932 , however , and over the next two years he became the infamous head of a gang of armed bank robbers that included Bonnie .
On April 13 , 1933 , the Barrow Gang narrowly escaped being captured in Joplin , Missouri .
Police raided their hideout after a tip from suspicious neighbors .
The latest two lawmen in what was by then a long string of murders , were killed in the shootout .
A now - famous roll of film containing pictures of Bonnie and Clyde was found in the hideout .
Clyde 's brother , Buck , and Buck 's wife Blanche had become members of the gang .
Buck was killed , and Blanche was captured in a later raid in Platte City , Missouri .
Bonnie and Clyde escaped again .
In 1934 , they freed a former gang member from Eastern State Prison in Texas , along with another prisoner .
It was a daring machine - gun raid in which one guard was killed and several were wounded .
After another robbery spree in Indiana , the Barrow Gang was tracked to a farm in Arcadia , Louisiana .
Leading the search were Texas Ranger Francis A. ( Frank ) Hamer and FBI special agent L.A. Kindell .
Hamer arranged a roadside ambush in Gibsland , Louisiana .
Travelling alone , Bonnie and Clyde were killed in a flurry of gunfire .
Their bodies were put on public display in Dallas before burial in their separate family plots .
Folklore subsequently glorified the criminal couple as Robin Hood - like characters .
A 1967 hit movie about them starred the beautiful and glamourous Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty .
The real Bonnie and real Clyde bore little resemblance to such popular stories .
On 21 May 2009 , at least five major cities will be holding a vigil for two American journalists who will have been held in detention for over ten weeks by the North Korean Government .
During Laura Ling and Euna Lee ’s closed door trials hundreds will be gathering in :
LA
Orlando
New York
Chicago
Portland
According to reports , Foreign governments have expressed concern saying that closed trials may not allow for a defense or fair trial .
Friends say that attention and support for the women who are being tried for “ illegal intruding ” is extremely important in helping to bring about a positive outcome .
According to witness reports in Huffington Post , the two California natives were seized while filming when North Korean border guards crossed into Chinese territory .
The two journalists were working on a story about North Korean refugees fleeing to China .
Toronto : Mass protest against Sri Lankan state ’s racist war
LTTE agents attack SEP supporters
By a WSWS reporting team
18 March 2009
A section of Monday 's protest in Toronto
Tens of thousands of Tamil Canadians took to the streets of Canada 's largest city Monday afternoon to protest against the murderous assault the Sri Lankan army is mounting against the largely defenceless Tamil population in the north of the island state .
The demonstrators , who formed a 7 - kilometer human - chain stretching across much of downtown Toronto , included workers , students and entire families .
Many reported having relatives who have been killed or wounded during the Sri Lankan government 's current offensive , which has involved indiscriminate shelling and strafing of civilian areas , a blockade of essential supplies , and a campaign of violence and threats aimed at forcing aid organizations to flee all areas outside government control .
While the demonstration expressed the anger and outrage of Tamil Canadians over the quarter - century long war , it was politically controlled by supporters and agents of the national - separatist Liberation Tamils of Tiger Eelam ( LTTE ) .
Organizers distributed LTTE flags and placards bearing the portrait of LTTE leader Prabakharan .
Other printed placards proclaimed , " The LTTE is the sole representative of the Tamil people " and " The LTTE is our Saviour . "
The organizers directed the demonstrators to appeal to Canada 's Conservative government , the Obama administration and other imperialist governments to place pressure on the Sri Lankan government to accept a ceasefire and recognize the rights of the Tamils , although these governments have aided and abetted the Sri Lankan state in its racist war .
In Canada 's case , the government has declared the LTTE a " terrorist organization , " thereby lending political support to the Sri Lankan government 's repudiation of a 2002 ceasefire agreement , and sought to choke off financial support for the LTTE from Tamil Canadians by making it a " terrorist crime " to donate to the LTTE or any aligned organization .
Nevertheless , the demonstration organizers handed out Canadian flags and led the crowd in chants of " Canada , Canada , Canada . "
The LTTE 's perspective of currying favor with imperialist governments is not just a response to the desperate military situation it now confronts as a result of the Sri Lankan military offensive .
In keeping with its aim of carving out an ethnically based capitalist nation - state in the island 's north and east , the LTTE has always sought to win the patronage of India and one or more of the great powers .
And in the diaspora , LTTE supporters have developed close ties to various big business parties , in Canada particularly with the Liberals .
The demonstration organizers ' pathetic attempt to ingratiate themselves with the Canadian ruling elite was the flip side of their use of violence against their working class opponents .
Agents of the LTTE surrounded and attacked supporters of the Socialist Equality Party ( SEP ) so as to prevent them from distributing a World Socialist Web Site statement titled " Troops out of north and eastern Sri Lanka ! "
The statement elaborates the socialist perspective to end the war and secure the democratic rights and basic social needs of Tamils and all the people of Sri Lanka .
It places full responsibility for the war on the Sinhala bourgeoisie , which has systematically discriminated against the Tamil minority since independence in 1948 , whipping up anti-Tamil chauvinism to divide and rule the working class and oppressed masses .
It indictes the imperialist powers , including Canada 's Harper government , for their complicity in the war , then summarizes the socialist critique of the LTTE 's nationalist politics made by the Socialist Equality Party of Sri Lanka .
" The LTTE 's own communal perspective , " reads the statement , " renders it incapable of making any appeal to the Sinhala working class and peasantry , which it blames for the repression and war .
Its violent attacks on Sinhalese civilians have only played directly into the hands of the Sinhalese extremists and militarists .
" Above all the disintegration of the LTTE and its inability to provide any way forward for the Tamil people makes clear that Tamil workers and peasants require a new strategy .
The real ally of the Tamil people is the international working class — the only force capable of putting an end to the bloody disaster in Sri Lanka and developing a genuine struggle against capitalism , the source of racialism and war . "
( For the full statement , see " Troops out of north and eastern Sri Lanka ! " )
Initially , demonstration marshals sporting Tiger T - shirts hovered around Tamils speaking to SEP supporters .
But quickly they and others in plainclothes carrying walkie - talkies resorted to more overt forms of intimidation .
SEP supporters distributing the statement were surrounded and told to stop leafleting .
" You have no permission here .
We will call the police , " declared one marshal .
When an SEP supporter replied that there is a democratic right to distribute leaflets in a public space , a marshal shouted , " You have no rights here .
Leave or there will be trouble . "
The marshals then jostled the reporter .
They shouted at him and struggled to tear the leaflets and his briefcase from his hands .
Other marshals approached bystanders who had taken leaflets and confiscated them .
Bullhorns were then used to warn the crowd not to take any of the " pink " leaflets — the statement was printed on pink paper — and marshals radioed other marshals throughout Toronto 's downtown to warn them of the SEP intervention .
This had a double - edged impact .
Later in the day , Tamils seeing the pink leaflet came over specifically to get one having heard from bullhorn announcements not to take them .
At one juncture , when SEP supporters attempted to move to another section of the city they were tailed by several persons armed with walkie - talkies .
Only by going into the crowded subway system were they able to shake off the pro-LTTE goons .
LTTE agents continued their intimidation campaign throughout the rest of the afternoon .
At one point when an SEP supporter appealed to the crowd to protest the goon tactics , a middle - aged Tamil man said , " I live over in St. Jamestown .
I know these Tiger boys .
They are little more than gangsters . "
Fearing a political reckoning for the desperate plight in which the Tamil people now find themselves , the LTTE is mounting an international campaign to prevent any discussion and debate among diaspora Tamils about how to secure their democratic rights and respond to the economic crisis that is devastating working people around the world .
In Europe , SEP supporters and leftists have been attacked for criticizing the LTTE or in any way challenging its dictatorial claim to be the Tamils ' " sole spokesman . "
( See " Send letters of protest : Oppose LTTE campaign of threats and violence against SEP supporters in Europe ! " )
Despite the marshals ' intimidation campaign , several of the demonstrators were happy to provide interviews to the World Socialist Web Site .
Three Tamil Canadian students , Athithya , Abinaya and Benita , spoke with the WSWS even as a pro-LTTE marshal lurked behind them .
" We 're here to protest against all the killings by the army back home , " said Athithya .
" We want the citizens of Canada to bring pressure on the politicians and the government .
We did this same action downtown in January and it seems it has had no effect so we are out here again . "
Benita added , " We have been back to Sri Lanka twice and we have lost loved ones in these attacks by the army .
They are bombing hospitals .
There is no food or medicine for the people .
I do n't know why the Canadian government has done nothing .
I guess Canadians do n't know what is going on .
We want to raise awareness . "
Siva , a garage mechanic , said , " The government of Rajapakse is a criminal government .
It is not just attacking Tamils , but anyone who opposes it .
I come from Colombo , the capital .
I ran away many years ago when they were killing Tamils in the streets just for being Tamils .
I will never forget those nights .
People should be treated with human rights , whether they be Tamil or Sinhalese .
This is why I do not support the Tigers .
They do not respect human rights either . "
Mohan , a Tamil teenager born and raised in downtown Toronto , said , " I do n't know too much about what is going on in Sri Lanka .
I have my own problems .
I have been out of school now for two years and I 've probably worked maybe three or four months since then .
You just can't find permanent work .
They use you for a few months and dump you .
But I have a lot of relatives still over there and my mother and father are really worried about them .
They keep telling me stories of how tough it is over there for everybody .
It probably is .
But it 's tough over here too . "

Neil Strauss hardly seems like a guy who ’d kill a goat and gut it with his own hands .
A slim intellectual in silver jewelry and designer jeans , he does n’t appear to be the kind of person who would stash food in a forest or plot an escape from his Laurel Canyon home using fire trails and a motorcycle he barely knows how to ride . ¶
Yet that ’s precisely what Strauss has learned to do over the last three years in an effort to prepare himself should society collapse .
It ’s a journey he not only chronicles in his new book , “ Emergency : This Book Will Save Your Life , ” but continues to pursue .
¶
Days before his book ’s release , Strauss ’ BlackBerry is brimming with projects .
( Get motorcycle license .
Take pain - resistance training .
Grind grain . )
He ’s looking to strike a few items off his list .
¶
“ I ’m here to pick up a shotgun , ” he says , stepping up to the counter at Gun World , a Burbank shop whose anteroom is loaded with ammo and shell cases .
The shotgun is a Remington 870 Wingmaster -- the third part of an unholy trinity that also includes a 9 - millimeter pistol and a rifle , all of which he keeps in a hidden safe at his house .
“ Three years ago , I never would have been in a gun store , ” says Strauss , who was a New York Times music and culture critic before writing the bestseller “ The Game , ” a guide to picking up women .
He also collaborated with Jenna Jameson on her 2004 memoir “ How to Make Love Like a Porn Star . ”
Strauss ’ transformation took place gradually .
In 1999 , halfway through a 10 - year stint at the Times , he moved to Los Angeles , where he became a regular participant in what he calls the “ stupid human Hollywood thing . ”
He spent sleepless nights with Marilyn Manson , Courtney Love and other musicians , frequently filing articles from their living rooms .
Although he ghost - wrote books with Manson and Mötley Crüe , his breakthrough came when he teamed up with Jameson .
That same year he left the Times .
In the meantime , he was growing increasingly concerned about societal breakdown and eventually decided to act upon his fears .
It started after Y2 K raised the specter of a doomsday , after Sept. 11 prompted him to purchase a gas mask , after the reelection of George W. Bush led him to investigate citizenship in other countries , after Hurricane Katrina made him realize the most powerful nation in the world could n’t protect its own citizens .
“ We were born with a silver spoon in our mouths .
Bad things happened to previous generations , ” says Strauss , explaining the original , third - person premise for “ Emergency , ” which evolved into a first - person survivalist how - to .
“ We had it all , ” continues Strauss , who is in his late 30s .
“ The Cold War was over .
The Internet was bringing everybody together .
Wars were a thing of the past .
Then all the things that happened from 2001 to today , it was like dominos falling over .
All of a sudden I realized that all the things you read about in history books , they could happen to you . ”
So , guns .
Standing between a mounted moose head and a trio of hulking , goateed clerks , Strauss does n’t look like a gun shop regular .
The only thing he has in common with most of the other people in the store is the fact that he is male .
And as males go , he does n’t exactly play macho .
He is Columbia - educated , petite , soft - spoken , borderline giggly .
He ’s “ a hipster ” who “ looked quite humorous in a class with a bunch of Blackwater types wearing combat boots and 511 tactical pants , ” says Kevin Reeve , who taught Strauss how to hijack a car and escape from handcuffs , among other things , in a class called Urban Escape and Evasion .
Survival instincts
Reeve , who runs a New Jersey firm called onPoint Tactical , also coached Strauss on a three - day survival exercise in Northern California ’s redwood forest , where the author brought nothing but his wits and a knife and lived on foraged food and water .
Wilderness survival is “ really hard ” for someone “ who is not a nature person , ” admits Strauss , who lived in a shelter of leaves and made fire using nothing but sticks and his shoelaces .
But it is also empowering .
In many ways , Strauss has only done what a lot of people might consider if they had the time and money .
He ’s even secured citizenship in another country .
It took more than a year , and half a million dollars , but he ’s now a citizen of the small Caribbean island of St. Kitts .
To get there , he ’s learning to fly an airplane .
Describing his training as “ a rabbit hole of preparedness , ” Strauss has also taken edible plant walks and learned how to fish and to sail a boat .
He has licenses to operate a ham radio and to work as a security guard .
He ’s apprenticed himself to a knife - making survivalist and trained in CPR and first aid .
He even became an emergency medical technician and joined the California Emergency Mobile Patrol , where he volunteers on the state ’s search and rescue team .
“ Everything is politically strange .
Half of what I ’m doing is completely right - wing stuff and half is really left - wing stuff , ” acknowledges Strauss , leaving Gun World after paying $ 919 for his new shotgun .
He throws the weapon in the back of his silver Dodge Durango .
Along with the gun , the cargo hold contains a mix of merchandise that proves his point .
There are survivalist supplies , rescue gear and spilled hay -- feed for the three goats he ’s raising at home , two of which he delivered himself .
His next errand ?
Picking up a pair of baby chickens from a feed store .
For a man who once spent 45 minutes staring at a paw print in the woods as part of a survivalist training course called Tracker School , Strauss is surprisingly dependent on technology .
Driving around L.A. , he ’s constantly checking his Garmin GPS and listening for directions from its robotic female voice .
“ There ’s a certain crew of people :
We ’re scared enough to get prepared , but we ’re not scared enough to leave the city , ” notes Strauss , a Chicago native who has spent his life in urban environments .
“ If you really think something ’s going to happen , you go out to Montana or Wyoming .
But when you start sacrificing your lifestyle , the things you enjoy , for safety , you ’re putting yourself in a prison . ”
Less worried
Judging from his chic Modernist home , Strauss is hardly living in a prison .
He ’s just folded in a new set of priorities .
His goats paw the refrigerator , roaming ( and defecating ) freely inside the house and around the slate patio that rings his swimming pool .
His kitchen counters hold Godiva chocolates and Grey Goose vodka -- along with containers of homemade strawberry preserves and beef jerky .
His garage houses surfboards , a Corvette and a generator .
And yet there ’s a method to the madness .
What began as an exercise in terror has led to self - reliance .
Sure , he ’s made plans to flee , but he ’s equally prepared to stick around and deal with the aftermath .
“ Before , ” he says , “ I really came out of a place of fear .
I was scared of all these things that could happen , and I used to spent time worrying about it .
There was a big rush , like I ’ve got to get this done before something happens . ”
But after three years of preparation , “ it ’s literally like I do n’t ever worry about it .
It does n’t mean my chances of surviving are better , but I kind of think that as much as the stuff buys you survival , it also buys you peace of mind . ”

British researchers hope to cut airline fuel bills by placing hundreds of thousands of tiny holes in the surface of a plane 's wing to reduce mid-flight drag .

This article is more than 11 years old
A team of British researchers reckon they have hit on a way of cutting airline fuel bills by up to a fifth by harnessing the same principle that applies when you blow across the top of a bottle to make a sound .
Speaking to BusinessGreen.com , Dr Duncan Lockerby , from the University of Warwick , who is leading the project , explained that placing tens or even hundreds of thousands of tiny holes in the surface of a plane 's wing should dramatically reduce mid-flight drag , cutting fuel bills and carbon emissions by up to 20 per cent in the process .
" Around half the drag a plane experiences is the result of skin friction , so anything that reduces that will deliver big savings in fuel use , " he said , adding that the research team was still not entirely clear how the phenomenon worked , but that early test results from wind tunnels had been encouraging .
Lockerby explained that the innovation is based on the Helmholtz resonance principle – the same principle that applies to blowing over a bottletop whereby air is forced into a cavity increasing the pressure and forcing air out of the space , creating an oscillation .
By perforating a plane 's wing with tiny holes with chambers underneath , the research team believes an additional layer of air can be created around the wing that limits drag .
Simon Crook , senior manager for aerospace and defence at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , which co-funded the research aviation giant Airbus , said that the breakthrough could help " drastically reduce the environmental cost of flying " .
The team is now working on prototypes designed to get a better understanding of the process and ensure that the perforations can be added without compromising the structural integrity of the aircraft .
Airbus is said to be keen to accelerate the project and it is hoped that new wings could be ready for trial as early as 2012 .
EPSRC said that if tests prove successful the technology could also be used to improve the fuel efficiency of cars , boats and trains .

Two inflammatory points in BLONDES are :
1. Women tend to have a same - race bias in marriage .
This is especially true of black women — at least in the US and UK .
Asian women have the weakest same - race bias .
Asian men , meanwhile , seldom marry women of other races .
2 . Short men get short shift .
Women prefer men who are taller and men prefer women who are shorter .
A new economic research paper , Anthropometry of Love : Height and Gender Asymmetries in Interethnic Marriages , led by an Oxford economist , combines these two findings .
The latter ( # 2 ) explains the former ( # 1 ) , they claim .
Height is a major factor , which means the reason Asian men do n’t fare as well in the interracial marriage market is they tend to be shorter than men of other races while Asian women have more options for the same reason .
Black women , meanwhile , tend to be taller of women of other races , so they fewer options .
( See discussion in the Times . )
We argue that a simple preference for a taller husband ( or shorter wife ) can explain part of the gender - specifi c asymmetries across ethnic groups in the propensity to outmarry .
Blacks are taller than Asians , and their height distribution is closer to whites .
Because they are taller , black men have better prospects on the white marriage market than Asian men .
For women , the reverse is true .
Because Asians are relatively short on average , women fare substantially better on the white marriage market than black women .
There ’s a certain ( uncomfortable ) logic to this , but height should n’t overshadow more important factors .
The economists ignore findings that many people tend to marry those from a similar background ( religion , educational level , and ethnicity including race ) , because familiar trumps foreign in a long - term context .
( Happily , certain behaviors such as talking about a favorite literary work reduced same - race preferences in one speed - dating study ) .
While height may well be a deciding factor in selecting a long - term partner , a shared background is likely stronger .
( Many non-Asian women believe Asian men are more traditional and would not marry them . )
Also overlooked by the economists are the other qualities that matter to women : status , paternal proclivity , and resources .
Like background , these qualities may be more influential than height .
Women are inclined to overcome their same - race and height biases when a man has an abundance of one of more of these qualities ( according to studies I describe in the the book ) .
This suggests that a short guy of any race will have more marriage options , including a tall choosy black woman , if he ’s successful , kid-loving , and shares a lot in common with that woman .
Note to economists : height is important to sexual selection — but it is n’t the only measure .
Larry Webster has been working at Mount Wilson Observatory outside Los Angeles for more than 30 years , doing everything from keeping toilets flushing and adjusting mirrors to mapping sunspots .
In September 2006 , the 51 - year - old solar observer came into work looking more like he was 90 .
He was dehydrated , jaundiced and had lost a lot of weight .
Although he spent a month in and out of emergency rooms for symptoms of nausea and vomiting , doctors were uncertain what had caused his illness .
So Webster began his own investigations into the source of the ailment and his mysterious case would eventually pique the interest of California health officials and convince an entomologist named Tom Schwan to fly halfway across the country in order to catch ticks inside the historic observatory .
It all started in the fall of 2006 when Webster invited a few local astronomers out to the 24 - inch ( 61 - centimeter )
Snow solar telescope to test out a few filters he was considering purchasing to look at the sun 's chromosphere .
Beforehand , he thought he should sweep away rodent feces that had accumulated and throw out some old cardboard boxes , because the telescope had only been used intermittently since astronomer George Ellery Hale first installed it in 1904 .
" Observatories are almost always in remote sites , " Webster explains , " This particular building — being so old — was more accessible by mice and chipmunks . "
About four days after the cleanup , his wife Elisa noticed two red circles on each of his shins just above the sock line , but he did n't think anything of it .
The bites faded over the next week , but just after dinner on Saturday , September 17 , Webster experienced a sudden fever , shaking chills , and joint and muscle pain .
" I was laying down so sick that I did n't feel like I could get up , " he says , " That progressed to nausea and vomiting . "
Webster went to see his doctor the next Wednesday , who told him he'd contracted a nasty stomach flu and gave him some medication to reduce his vomiting .
But he threw up again the next day and felt so bad he went into the emergency room .
Doctors there put him on an IV to rehydrate him , gave him pain relievers , and analyzed his blood and urine , releasing him later that night with another flu diagnosis .
Webster 's illness would return two more times before he was finally hospitalized and given his first dose of antibiotics .
The doctors said he was recovering from a case of mononucleosis .
" I was let go from the hospital and I felt better , " he says , " but the whole thing bothered me , and being a scientist by nature I tried to understand what I had . "
He went to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control Web site , along with several others , reading about any disease that could be carried by a rodent .
He read about rabbit fever and hantavirus , and finally came to a category called relapsing tick fever , caused by a spirochete bacteria present in wild rodents and transmitted by soft - bodied ticks .
So , he called his doctor .
" Oh , no , " she told him , " that 's a Third World disease .
We do n’t have that in this country . "
Webster was unconvinced .
Soft - bodied ticks are found in dark recesses like caves , which he says was a lot like the 150 - foot - ( 45 - meter - ) long corrugated steel building that housed the old telescope .
He decided to build himself a tick trap , and read that the pests are attracted by carbon dioxide .
" I took a piece of dry ice [ frozen CO2 ] , " he says , " and wrapped it in pieces of terry cloth and then duct taped them to these long bamboo sticks I got at a garden supply store . "
The next day , he pulled the sticks from some recesses and discovered what looked to his untrained eye like a soft - bodied tick .
He sent the period - size insect to the University of California , Riverside , where a professional entomologist confirmed his diagnosis .
By now , Webster was a man obsessed .
First , he convinced a new doctor to prescribe him tetracycline , the preferred treatment .
Then , since he could n't find much information on ticks transmitting relapsing fever in southern California , he tracked down Tom Schwan , the world 's relapsing tick fever expert who works at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
Schwan agreed to run a DNA test on the ticks and confirmed that they contained the spirochete Borrelia hermsii .
" With the vector and spirochete found in the very room where Larry was exposed , " Schwan says , " I was convinced he had contracted relapsing fever . "
If it was true , Schwan realized , it would be the first new case of relapsing tick fever in Los Angeles County since the 1930s .
Although the disease was known from other parts of California , he felt that the discovery warranted a collecting trip to the telescope to establish a causal relationship between the microbe and the disease and to raise awareness of the illness .
In 2007 , he and Webster caught live ticks and allowed them to feed on mice in the lab .
Within a week , most of the animals had ruffed hair and tested positive for the disease .
Then , in July and October 2008 , the team set out rodent traps and found that wild animals in the region tested positive for antibodies to the disease .
Today , Webster has made a full recovery and now works as the site manager for Georgia State University 's Chara Array .
As it happens , Schwan is also something of a closet astronomer with an affinity for " optical scientific instruments . "
He 's had a Unitron telescope since he was a kid , and after meeting Webster , he bought a new Spencer Browning & Co. telescope on eBay to go with his antique microscope collection .
Just the other night , he had been gazing at the stars in Montana trying to find Neptune above Jupiter .
Schwan and his team describe their work in the July issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases .
Notably , Webster is listed as a co-author , placing him in the pantheon of scientists who have studied their own infections .
" This disease is underdiagnosed and underreported , " Schwan says .
" Larry was the guy [ who ] put this infection on the map . "
Chinatown grocer David Chen was standing by the plants outside his shop when an angry looking man walked briskly toward him yesterday afternoon .
" You beat up my dad , " the man said heatedly .
He was wearing a red hooded sweater and appeared to be in his 20s .
" You tied him up and beat the hell out of him . "
Chen 's wife picked up her phone and threatened to dial 911 .
" Your daddy hit me first , " Chen replied , gesturing to his left side .
" I have bruises on my arm . "
The last few days have been a whirlwind , the 35 - year - old grocer said .
On Saturday morning , he said he spotted a man on a bike stealing a box of money tree plants , worth about $ 60 .
It was n't the first time the man had stolen something from the store , Chen said .
So when he saw the alleged thief later that day , he confronted him .
The man dropped his bike and ran south on Grange Place from Dundas St. W. Chen chased after him with two other employees .
When they caught him , they tied him up by his hands and feet , put him in a delivery truck and contacted police .
But when the officers arrived at the Lucky Moose Food Mart , the whole group was arrested and charged .
The three grocers were charged with assault and kidnapping ; the man on the bike was charged with theft .
Chen was kept in a holding cell at 52 Division overnight .
He was released on $ 7,500 bail .
The man on the bike was released on $ 1,000 bail .
The incident has Chinatown shopkeepers and customers in an uproar .
They say the area is plagued with petty theft , but that police are too busy to properly patrol the area .
Chen was doing what has to be done , they say .
Carol
Yun , who runs a knick - knack and clothing shop down the street from the Lucky Moose , said shoplifting is a daily occurrence .
" They come by on bikes and take things set up outside .
Sometimes I chase them , or they keep coming back , " she said in Cantonese through a translator .
" ( In China ) this would not have happened .
You have to tie them up , otherwise they 'll get away before the police get there . "
Last summer , the local Business Improvement Area hired two private security guards to patrol Spadina Ave. , from Queen St. W. to College St . They plan to do the same this summer , said chairman Stephen Chan .
" When we call police , sometimes they have higher priorities and it can sometimes take two or three hours , " said Chan , who also is an owner of the Bright Pearl Seafood Restaurant .
" That 's why in Chinatown we have the private security to patrol the streets ( in ) July , August and September . "
Supt .
Hugh Ferguson , who oversees 52 Division , said there are eight levels of priority for calls .
Dealing with calls is like triage in an emergency room .
" It 's not about who gets there first .
It 's based on need .
If there 's an assault taking place and the suspect is there , we 'll ( attend ) to that first , " he said .
" Incidents of where it takes hours would be the exception , not the rule . "
But according to Chen , response time is always lengthy .
What was he supposed to do ?
This is what he said outside the grocery store to the young man yesterday afternoon , around 2 p.m .
" What am I supposed to do ?
What am I supposed to do ?
He took the ... "
But the man cut him off , loudly demanding to know who cares if his dad stole something .
By then a group of customers had congregated around Chen .
" Man , this has been vexing me for two days , " the young man said and stalked off .
If the man is , in fact , the accused shoplifter 's son , there could be charges , said Chen 's lawyer , Lenard Kotylo .

" The ( accused ) is not supposed to communicate directly or indirectly with Mr. Chen , " Kotylo said .
" It 's extremely rare for ...( apprehension of a shoplifter ) to result in a kidnapping charge .
That 's an amazing charge to lay in the circumstances , " the lawyer said .
Police arrived at the grocery store about an hour and a half after yesterday 's altercation .
Detectives are now investigating .

This nice old granny is the ' Phantom Killer ' police were searching for after her DNA was found at 39 crime scenes across Europe - because she made the cotton buds used to collect evidence !
BILD tracked down Erika S.* ( 71 ) , and she certainly does n't look like your average ' killer ' .
She was pictured in a woolly jumper carrying a basket of eggs through a quiet village in Bavaria in Germany .
The ' Phantom Killer ' Phantom killer a myth Police track DNA of a cotton bud maker Germany 's ' phantom killer ' was revealed as a myth after police tracked the DNA of the maker of cotton buds used to collect evidence for two years .
But she unintentionally caused the biggest murder mystery since the Second World War .
Erika was responsible for packing cotton buds used by police to collect DNA at crime scenes , but her own DNA was somehow left all over the swabs .
Police found the trace at different crime scenes in Germany and all over Europe and believed her to be the culprit .
The hunt for the ‘ Phantom Killer ’ baffled investigators as her DNA was found at seven different murder sites .
In 2007 a police woman was shot dead in the German town of Heilbronn and the DNA was found at the scene .
Detectives could n’t work out why it showed up time and time again .
The police believed the culprit to be a woman involved in the drug scene .
They then decided that it could be a transsexual , or even a woman who looked like a man !
Thousands of saliva tests were taken , and still nothing came up .
While detectives were running out of ideas , Erika continued to diligently and unsuspectingly pack the cotton buds for the company which supplied them to the police .
In March , investigators announced the embarrassing fiasco to the general public :
The DNA found at 39 different sites actually belongs to a worker at the cotton bud company !
BILD found the respectable pensioner in a little village in Bavaria .
Erika S. no longer works for the company .
According to reports , she was not careful enough when she handled the swabs .
Her husband told BILD : “ My wife is fed up with the whole thing . ”

The Case for a Creator , Chapter 3
Chapter 3 of Case , which interviews the creationist Jonathan Wells , haphazardly mixes together claims from many different scientific disciplines and will probably take the most installments of any chapter to fully refute .
But we ’ll begin with a simpler claim .
As I mentioned previously , Strobel seeks to create the appearance of a scientific controversy raging over evolution .
His primary piece of evidence is the Discovery Institute ’s infamous petition , “ A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism “ :
We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life .
Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged .
The DI has found several hundred scientists and other professionals to sign this statement .
But although Strobel highly touts the few luminaries on the list – and I ’m not denying their existence – what he does n’t mention is that a significant number of signatories have no relevant scientific credentials at all .
Many of them have degrees only in mathematics , engineering , physics or computer science , and while they may be expert in their own fields , those qualifications have little or nothing to do with evolutionary theory .
Would we credit the opinions of biologists who signed a statement proclaiming themselves skeptical of the inflationary theory of cosmology , or chemists who doubted the Turing - completeness models of computer science ?
But rather than leave it at that , let ’s crunch some numbers .
I downloaded the DI ’s petition in PDF form , converted it to text , and then wrote a Perl script which scans the list and counts the signatories by affiliation .
The categories I used were as follows : biology ( a large category including everything from genetics to paleontology to embryology ) , chemistry , geology ( including hydrology ) , medicine ( all forms of medical specialties , including veterinary medicine ) , health and nutrition , agronomy / agriculture ( including crop and soil science , forestry , and degrees related to farming and fisheries ) , physics and astronomy , mathematics , and engineering .
These categories sufficed to classify the vast majority of signatories to the DI ’s list .
Since the biology - related degrees are most directly relevant to evaluating the truth of evolution , my script was written to give that match top priority , and to choose a less directly related field only if necessary .
This work produced the following summary ( you can also download the raw text of the petition and my Perl script ) :
Biology 146 Chemistry 151 Geology 37 Medicine 114 Health / Nutrition 10 Agronomy / Agriculture 12 Physics 103 Mathematics 45 Engineering 113 Other 23 Total 754
Although there are some biologists on the DI ’s list , they ’re not a majority or even a plurality .
In fact , the largest single category is chemists – a field whose bearing on evolution is tangential at best .
Medical doctors , physicists , mathematicians and engineers make up much of the rest of the list .
Still , the DI petition does have some real biologists .
The question is , what percentage of the world ’s scientists does this group represent ?
After all , if there were only a thousand biologists worldwide , 146 dissenters would be a sizable faction .
If there were a million , 146 dissenters would be an insignificantly tiny minority .
To gauge the answer to this question , we can turn to a very useful data source .
In order to demonstrate the true depth of scientific support for evolution , the National Center for Science Education put together an amusing counterpetition , dubbed Project Steve .
They wrote up a strong , unequivocal statement supporting evolution and expressing opposition to intelligent design .
Then they circulated it in the scientific community , with one catch : they would only accept signatures from scientists named Steve ( or Stephen , or Stephanie , or some other variant of that name ) .
How many Steves did the NCSE find ?
The answer , as of this writing , is over one thousand .
Using the same script as I used on the DI petition , here ’s the raw text and the breakdown of the Steves by specialty :
Biology 523 Chemistry 101 Geology 72 Medicine 127 Health / Nutrition 8 Agronomy / Agriculture 2 Physics 141 Mathematics 27 Engineering 49 Other 33 Total 1083
You can see for yourself that , unlike the DI ’s list , practicing scientists with degrees in biology make up nearly half of Project Steve .
They form by far the largest single bloc and vastly outnumber the signatories from other fields .
To meaningfully compare the two lists and the sizes of the communities they represent , one final question presents itself :
How many Steves are on the DI ’s list ?
To answer that , I wrote another script to scan for DI Steves , and here are the results :
Stephen J. Cheesman , Ph.D. Geophysics , University of Toronto
Stephen Crouse , Professor of Kinesiology , Texas A&M University
Stephen C. Knowles , Ph.D. Marine Science , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill
Steven Gollmer , Ph.D. Atmospheric Science , Purdue University
Stephan J. G. Gift , Professor of Electrical Engineering , The University of the West Indies
Stephen Meyer , Ph.D. Philosophy of Science , Cambridge University
Steve Maxwell , Associate Professor of Molecular and Cellular Medicine , Texas A&M University , H.S.C .
Stephen Sewell , Assistant Professor of Family Medicine , Texas A&M University
Stephen Lloyd , Ph.D. Materials Science , University of Cambridge ( UK )
C. Steven Murphree , Professor of Biology , Belmont University
The numbers speak for themselves : the DI has only ten total Steves , as compared to 1083 for the NCSE , and only one in biology , as compared to the 523 NCSE Steves .
From this evidence , one can easily extrapolate to the total number of scientists who stand squarely behind evolution as the best and the only scientific explanation for the diversity of life .
The ratio of evolutionary scientists to creationists appears to be in the neighborhood of 500 to 1 .
Are there some scientists who deny evolution ?
I do n’t doubt it .
In a field as large and diverse as evolutionary biology , you ’ll always find a few naysayers willing to challenge the consensus view .
And you ’ll always find scientists , even renowned ones , who are known for their quirks , eccentricities , and fringe views .
( The late John Mack , a Harvard psychiatrist who believed in alien abduction , is a case in point . )
Having a Ph.D is no guarantee of always being rational .
But the lesson of Project Steve is that a tiny , carefully cultivated minority of dissenters in no way matches the overwhelming tide of real , practicing scientists who use evolution in their lab and field work every day .
This conclusion holds all the more when those dissenters openly admit they were motivated by their religious beliefs to attack evolution before they ever learned about the evidence .
Such is Wells ’ first interviewee , whom we ’ll meet next .

A group of 20 to 30 people dressed in black ninja costumes and masks vandalized east side businesses Friday night , causing thousands of dollars in window damage , police said Saturday .
' They were yelling ' Black Knights , '' Milwaukee Police Lt. Milan Stojkovic said .
That 's apparently what the group calls itself , and it may have been involved in two to three other vandalism incidents in the past couple years , Police Lt. Michael Robertson said .
Windows were smashed at US Bank , Whole Foods , Qdoba and Bruegger 's about 11 p.m. Friday .
Police were investigating whether the vandalism may have been related to a protest earlier Friday evening by a group of self - titled ' anarchists ' in the Riverwest area , police spokeswoman Anne Schwartz said .
No arrests had been made .
Some acts were caught on business video surveillance .
Police were searching for a green 1992 Honda Civic with a license plate number of 547 - HGH , in which some suspects may have fled .

Police records indicate cop planted gun on dead teen : lawsuit David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday April 2 , 2009
Print This Email
This A Minneapolis family is suing after attorneys discovered in police records what they say is proof that a 19 - year - old gunned down by an officer in 2006 while allegedly waving a gun , was actually unarmed .
Officer Jason Anderson , who shot Fong Lee eight times after chasing him through a playground , was honored for his bravery after a Baikal .380 was found just two feet from the corpse .
But a new suit filed by Fong 's family carries the weight of police records which indicate officer Anderson had taken the Russian firearm from his precinct 's evidence locker , where it had been logged after a burglary in 2004 .
Attorneys for Fong 's family also released video surveillance images which they say prove Lee was not armed .
An additional apparent buoy to Fong 's family : the gun , which was allegedly waved at police , did not turn up any fingerprints or DNA , despite the chief of police claiming otherwise to the victim 's family and a citizen panel .
" The witnesses said [ Police Chief Timothy ]
Dolan made the statement to them and Fong Lee 's family members , " reported TwinCities.com .
" They said the chief said the prints bolstered the officer 's claim that the man was carrying a gun and the officer shot in self - defense  a claim now challenged by lawyers for the dead man 's family .
" ' The chief said that he had a fingerprint on the gun .
I heard that , ' Al Flowers , a member of the Police Community Relations Council , said Wednesday .
' That 's how the chief downplayed it to everybody , by putting it down there that he had a fingerprint on the gun . ' "
" But new evidence filed Monday in a lawsuit brought by Lee 's family against Andersen and the city of Minneapolis suggests that the gun had been in police possession , not Lee's , for nearly two years before the shooting , " reported the Star - Tribune .
" A Police Department report provided to Judge Paul Magnuson showed the gun found near Lee 's body was the same gun recovered from a burglary in north Minneapolis in 2004 , inventoried and kept in the department 's property room since the burglary .
" In alleging the gun was planted , the filing says that when the Police Department discovered the origin of the gun , it issued a new supplemental report " trying to intimate " the gun recovered in 2004 and registered to the person who was burglarized might now not be the same gun .
In 2004 , police ran the gun 's serial number and verified it belonged to the burglary victim , but never returned it to him , according to the document filed Monday . "
" Officer Andersen was found to be justified in his shooting of Fong Lee in 2006 by the police department 's internal investigation , " reported NBC's KARE 11 .
" Police Chief Tim Dolan also defended Andersen 's actions publicly .
Anderson was even given an award for his actions by the department calling his work that day , brave .
" Andersen joined the Minneapolis police department in August of 2005 and remains active on the force . "
Police have steadfastly denied the family 's claims and say they are confident a further investigation will clear officer Anderson of the allegations .

LATELY , I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING some of the infighting between atheism and religion on the web .
I 've been impressed with a sort of agreement underlying the arguments .
In particular , it seems to me that atheists tend to give a lot of ground to those on the fundamentalist end of the spectrum .
For one thing , there 's a definite tendency to assume that the most anti-intellectual , most intolerant , and , I might as well say it , most ignorant Christians are the best representatives of Christianity .
In one sense that is certainly true .
There are , quite probably , more numerous and more vocal Christians from that end of the continuum then there are from the other .
But there 's another sense in which the equation is problematic .
There are a great many atheists in the world — more every day — and many of them are also both vocal and ignorant .
Would it make sense to consider them representative of atheism ?
My own view is that the battle lines have been badly drawn .
I do n't think that the question of God is anywhere near the real center of the debate .
This may be , in part , due to how I became an atheist in the first place , but it 's also grounded in the debate itself .
What is that debate , really ?
Let me suggest a mental experiment by way of answering that question .
Consider what the real differences are between atheism and religion , outside of the God thing .
I 'll let Christianity stand in for religion in general here , since it 's the theology I know .
I 'll also use a sort of generalized atheist with a scientific world - view , though I am aware that there are other kinds :
Atheists believe that the truth is best discovered through research and reason rather than authority : whether that authority is vested in a priest or a book .
Atheists believe that the best place to look for the answers to questions about the nature of the physical world is the hard sciences rather than a religious tradition .
Atheists believe that religions ought not to be allowed to force their beliefs on others , or use government to turn those beliefs into law .
Atheists believe that matters of morality and ethics should not be decided by a religious elite .
Atheists are more likely to turn to the social sciences for answers about human nature and behavior than to an ancient text .
Atheists do n't tend to believe that things we can't see and touch , like ghosts and gods , actually exist .
You probably expect me to now produce a list about Christians which indicates the opposite position on every point above .
The problem is , I know too many Christians .
In fact , once you get out of the most conservative religious circles you find many Christians on the same page for at least numbers one through five , and the further you get from those circles , the more such Christians you find .
To be continued ...

A few weeks back , someone pointed me to a Twitter message where one Twitter user was ( jokingly ) accusing another of copyright infringement for repeating a message .
While the situation was amusing , you knew it was only a matter of time until the question became more serious .
Mark Cuban put up a blog post this weekend asking about the copyrightability of Twitter messages .
His question revolves around whether or not it 's copyright infringement for someone like ESPN to repeat what he wrote in a Twitter message , which he would have preferred they did n't quote .
I 'm certainly no copyright lawyer -- so perhaps some could chime in in the comments -- but it seems like there would be two issues here .
The first is whether or not the content is covered by copyright -- and , formessages the answer would probably be yes ( there would need to be some sort of creative element to the messages to make that happen , so a simple " hi " or " thanks " or whatever might not cut it ) .
But , the more important question then would be whether or not ESPN could quote the Twitter message .
And , there , the answer is almost certainly , yes , they could , just as they could quote something you wrote in a blog post .
If you ran down the fair use test , it 's difficult to see how a public Twitter message would n't easily qualify .
If it 's ESPN , itbe for commercial use , but not in the sense of " selling " the content .
Plus , it 's for journalistic reasons , which is often given a fair use pass .
Second is the nature of the copyrighted work -- which , being a Twitter message , I would guess most judges would assume it 's expected that the content can ( or even should ) be repeated .
The third test fails , since it would be the entire message , but the fourth test , on " the effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work " would almost certainly point towards fair use .
Since the four factors are n't weighted equally , I think the only clear " failure " is the weakest and least important of the four tests ( how much of the content was used -- which is way outweighed by the other factors ) , it 's hard to see how this is n't a perfectly reasonable use .
But , of course , with copyright designed for a world before everyone had a printing press , we 're going to come across more such questions in the future -- and I 'm sure there will be a few lawsuits along the way .
For example ... while it's not a copyright lawsuit , Courtney Love has been sued for libel due to her Twitter messages .
Apparently , she 's been Tweeting in anger against her former fashion designer -- Dawn Simorangkir -- and Simorangkir is now suing for defamation .
The messages themselves may prove to be defamatory ( assuming they 're not true ) , calling the woman :
There 's also the message claiming that the designer would be " hunted til your [ sic ] dead , " which seems more like a threat than libelous .
Of course , one could argue that the legal filing by the designer is also potentially libelous , stating : I would imagine that , if Courtney Love were not in a drug - induced psychosis , she might find that claim objectionable .
Still , you have to wonder if there were a better way to handle this .
For example , filing the lawsuit seems to callattention to the falling out between the two , perhaps leading many more people who might be interested in Simorangkir 's work to think twice .
While Love , as a celebrity , does have a certain reach , it seems like Simorangkir could better respond just by laying out the facts of the situation and telling her side of the story in a calm and clear manner , which compared to some rantings on Twitter would probably give people a good counterbalance without needing to involve the courts .
Either way , as these two stories demonstrate , we 're in for a long series of lawsuits and legal threats having to do with Twitter messages .

Sen .
Arlen Specter told a boisterous crowd of union activists today that he backs a public health insurance option as part of the health care overhaul Congress is debating .
" I know you are very interested in the public component and I think Senator Schumer has the right idea about having a public component , " Specter said at a rally held at the Capitol City Brewery near Union Station .
The shift -- Specter opposed a public option only months ago -- comes as Specter faces a potential primary opponent next spring in U.S. Rep .
Joe Sestak and as a new poll shows his favorability rating at a 17 - year low .
Here are all of his remarks , as provided by his staff ...
I compliment you on your tenacity and your determination and your passion .
I agree with you that health care is a right .
I am sorry to be a little late but President Obama scheduled a meeting at the White House on immigration and it ran a little long .
But I ’m glad to see you here , and I ’m glad to have the opportunity to speak to you .
We are working hard on health care reform legislation .
President Obama has established a summit and invited me to attend .
And I do believe that there will be health care legislation .
I know you are very interested in the public component and I think Senator Schumer has the right idea about having a public component which has a level playing field with the private sector , but the public component can be included .
I started life as a Democrat .
My family was a typical American family , immigrant parents , tough times during the Depression , FDR Democrats - I was a JFK Democrat .
I tried in the Senate for years to have a moderate wing and when President Obama was elected and wanted to bring in the stimulus package , and came and talked to the Senators and laid it on the line about the United States facing possibly a 1929 - type depression .
I voted for the stimulus package - provided a key vote to get it passed .
For Pennsylvania , it means 143,000 jobs , it means $ 16 billion , it means the continuation of Medicaid and Medicare , and SCHIP – health care for children .
It was the right thing to do .
I have had a voting record over the years more in line with Democrats than Republicans .
I voted for a woman ’s right to choose .
I took the lead with Senator Harkin on increasing funding for the National Institutes of Health from $ 12 to 30 billion .
I voted 22 times for Davis - Bacon , 20 times for extending unemployment compensation , cosponsored legislation for the minimum wage .
There were a lot of Democrats who had been urging me to change my registration .
I rode the train for three decades with then - Senator Biden from Washington to Wilmington , and I went on to Philadelphia .
You know how repetitious Joe Biden can be .
And Ed Rendell has urged me for years to become a Democrat .
You may not know that I gave Ed Rendell his first job out of law school .
He was a law student at Villanova , I was District Attorney ; he wanted to become an Assistant D.A. so he could become famous and get to be governor and there you are .
He wanted me to become a Democrat .
And after I voted for the stimulus package I found more Republicans who wanted me to be a Democrat than Democrats who wanted me to become a Democrat .
So I went with the flow and we feel very comfortable .
I do n’t have to look over my right shoulder anymore .
I came in with Eileen Connolly who ’s holding my coat - and my wallet .
The Employee Free Choice
Act was mentioned , and we ’re working hard to find the answer which will get early union certification and we ’ll get the first contract .
But today I know your focus is on health care .
I have to now to the Senate chamber .
We ’re about to vote on Dean Koh where the filibuster was defeated .
He ’s a very strong Obama nominee to be legal counsel to the Department of State .
But I thank you for coming to Washington , and I thank you for putting up with this heat and waiting and I thank you for your passion and your presence here and your rally and your enthusiasm has a big effect on what goes on three blocks away on the Congress of the United States and you will get health care this year .

President Barack Obama arrived in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for consultations with Saudi King Abdullah .
Reuters notes : “ Saudi Arabia is among the United States ’ top 15 trading partners , with two - way trade worth $ 67.3 billion last year .
The kingdom , whose currency is pegged to the dollar , has expanded trade with Asia in recent years but still depends on high - tech U.S. goods . ”
Obama stressed more the place of Saudi Arabia as a holy land to Muslims , since the Prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around 570 CE and migrated to Medina in 622 CE .
Obama explained , “ I thought it was very important to come to the place where Islam began and to seek his majesty ’s counsel . ”
The Saudis have been advising the US government on Islamic affairs for decades , and both George HW Bush and George W. Bush were close to the Saudi royal family .
What Obama is doing is not new .
What is new is his willingness to speak about the relationship openly .
Obama will get points for visiting the Muslim holy land for consultations ahead of his speech , as is clear from the positive coverage of the pan-Arab daily , Al - Sharq al - Awsat [ The Middle East . ]
I ’m traveling and did n’t have time today to analyze the Usamah Bin Laden tape that was issued on Tuesday to rain on Obama ’s parade .
I agree with those observers who say that Bin Laden ’s screed is a sign of weakness and of anxiety .
Bin Laden is afraid that Obama will become an opinion leader for the Middle East .
But Bin Laden ’s new issue , of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the impact on them of the US military , is not actually very salient in the Arab world , according to opinion polls .
I do n’t know if Bin Laden is actually dead or not , but he is increasingly yesterday ’s news in the region .
Obama does have a chance to be much more widely admired and emulated there .
President Barack Obama telegraphed some of his thinking about the Muslim world and his current trip to the Middle East in a BBC interiew .
Dan Gilgoff of US News and World Report gets the scoop .
It turns out that the Obama administration has been consulting widely with US religious leaders , including Muslims , in shaping the speech he is giving today in Cairo .
White House spokesmen Robert Gibbs and Denis McDonough previewed the speech here .
Gibbs said :
‘ Now , the foundation of that engagement as he sees it is the ability to engage each other on the basis of mutual respect and mutual interests .
And in that light , he feels it ’s important to speak very openly and candidly about the very full range of issues that have caused some tensions between the United States and the Muslim world , and then also present a great deal of opportunity for partnership in the future .
To begin with , I think he ’ll take on directly some of the misperceptions that may have emerged as well as some of the differences that have emerged .
I think he ’ll acknowledge the need for us to get to know each other better .
As he has said , he ’ll , for instance , discuss the relationship between Islam and America within America , particularly in light of the contributions of American Muslims .
But then what he will do is really go through in a very thorough way a broad range of issues that have been at the forefront of the agenda : violent extremism and the threat that it poses , and what America has done in response ; the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan and what we ’re doing there , and what we hope to do in the future in partnership with Afghans and Pakistanis .
He ’ll discuss Iraq , both what we have done there and what we are doing in the future , again , to transition to Iraqi responsibility for Iraq .
He ’ll discuss of course the Israeli - Palestinian issue and the broader Arab - Israeli issue , and acknowledging the fact that this has been a very important source of tension and passion for people of all faiths within this region and around the world , and he will discuss in some detail his view of the conflict and what needs to be done to resolve it .
He will discuss both what that means in terms of Israelis and Palestinians and the United States and the Arab states , as well . ’
Ahem :
Engaging the Muslim World , my new book .
The overlap between the subjects Gibbs and McDonough mention as Obama ’s concerns , and what I treat in the book is quite substantial .

In a live interview on CNBC today , Warren Buffett said there has been little progress over the past few months in the " economic war " being fought by the country .
" We have n't got the economy moving yet , " he told Becky Quick .
READ THE FULL CNBC INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT
While the economy is a " shambles " and likely to stay that way for some time , he remains optimistic there will eventually be a recovery over a period of years .
BECKY :
The last time we sat down to talk to you was on May 4 , and at that point you told us that you think we 're in an economic war right now .
How much progress do you think we 've made in that war ?
BUFFETT : Well , it 's been pretty flat .
I get figures on 70 - odd businesses , a lot of them daily .
Everything that I see about the economy is that we 've had no bounce .
The financial system was really where the crisis was last September and October , and that 's been surmounted and that 's enormously important .
But in terms of the economy coming back , it takes a while .
There were a lot of excesses to be wrung out and that process is still underway and it looks to me like it will be underway for quite a while .
In the ( Berkshire Hathaway ) annual report I said the economy would be in a shambles this year and probably well beyond .
I 'm afraid that 's true .
Buffett also noted that he had a cataract operation on his left eye about a month ago .
He joked that he thought it might help him see " green shoots " for the economy , but so far he has n't seen any hopeful signs .
Schoolboy snubbed by Megan Fox at Transformers premiere flying to New York tonight to meet her
The London schoolboy left looking unhappy after being snubbed by Transformers star Megan Fox is being flown out to receive an apology and finally meet his idol .
A photo of 11 - year - old Harvey Kindlon being rebuffed when he tried to hand Fox a yellow rose has tugged at the heartstrings of America - and as a result he has been offered a trip to Los Angeles to meet her , a website claimed .
After a reward of $ 5,000 was offered to find out the schoolboy 's identity he was discovered by a user of the social networking site Facebook .
[ caption ]
His lucky day : Schoolboy Harvii attempted to hand a rose to Megan Fox after the Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen premiere , but was rebuffed
Harvey 's cousin , 18 - year - old Holly Bramley , confirmed to website netnewsdaily.com he will be flying to New York tonight to meet Megan with his mother and a friend .
Film company Kodak are flying the schoolboy - who spells his name ' Harvii ' on his Facebook site - over to the States so he can give Fox the rose in person .
An apologetic Megan has promised that this time she will be more receptive .
She said : ' There were , like , 80 million people everywhere .
It was dark , all I see are flashes .
Everyone 's yelling different things ... and I did n't know that was happening .
' I feel so sad for him .
That 's so terrible .
That kills me .'
Transformed : Brunette bombshell Megan
Fox appeared on the Letterman show last night in a figure - hugging body con dress
Apology :
The actress has promised to apologise to Harvey in person
The 23 - year - old recorded a personal apology to Harvii , and promised to make amends .
Close : Megan cosies up to co-star Shia LeBeouf at the London premiere
' I 'm sorry , sweet boy .
I would never do that to you and I would gladly accept your rose if I see you again .
' The paparazzi would not let you to me .
I 'm so embarrassed .'
And one lucky Canadian will also get $ 5,000 dollars , after tracking Harvii down through Facebook .
Rumours have circulated lately that Megan 's relationship with her Transformers co-star Shia LeBoeuf may be more than just friendship .
The pair , who have frequently spoken of their chemistry but continue to insist they are just friends , were spotted enjoying an early morning coffee together in Los Angeles on Sunday , before she drove him to a physical therapy session for his injured hand .
The co-stars have frequently spoken of their affection for each other and last week Shia said : ' Maybe I 'll date her now she 's single ' .
The status of Megan 's on / off relationship with ex-fiancé Brian Austin Green , 35 , is currently unclear .
At the Leicester Square premiere of the Transformers sequel last week , Megan said : ' I 'm currently what you would call single I guess . '

Man , the consolidation efforts are really heating up .
Just days after Cisco forked out a small fortune to acquire Pure Digital , HDD mainstay Western Digital has penned a check for $ 65 million in cold , hard cash in order to acquire SiliconSystems , Inc . Said outfit is an Aliso Viejo , California - based supplier of solid - state drives for the embedded systems market , and rather than wasting any more time falling behind in the SSD realm , WD figured it prudent to just buy the technology it needed to position itself as a legitimate competitor .
WD has already made clear that it hopes to sell SSDs for the netbook , client and enterprise markets , and given that integration will begin " immediately , " we 're hoping to see some shipping products sooner rather than later .

Remember the Clinton presidency ?
A popular center - left Democratic president , with a popular domestic agenda , drove the right into apoplexy .
Conservatives came up with bizarre conspiracy theories , casually threw around truly insane rhetoric , raised a lot of fears about the U.N. and America “ sovereignty , ” and Fox News did its level best to whip uninformed right - wing activists into a frenzy .
I wonder why that seems familiar .
The New York Times ‘ Charles
Blow explains today that he ’s been “ consuming as much conservative media as possible ” lately in order to “ get a better sense of the mind and mood of the right . ”
He ’s found that conservatives are not only “ apocalyptic , ” but after two months of a Democratic administration , they feel “ isolated , angry , betrayed and besieged . ”
And what seemed at first like “ harmless , hotheaded expostulation , ” with right - wing media personalities deceiving a right - wing audience with bogus demagoguery , has actually led Blow to believe “ it ’s not all just harmless talk . ”
For some , their disaffection has hardened into something more dark and dangerous .
They ’re talking about a revolution .
Some simply lace their unscrupulous screeds with loaded language about the fall of the Republic .
We have to “ rise up ” and “ take back our country . ”
Others have been much more explicit .
For example , Chuck Norris , the preeminent black belt and prospective Red Shirt , wrote earlier this month on the conservative blog WorldNetDaily : “ How much more will Americans take ?
When will enough be enough ?
And , when that time comes , will our leaders finally listen or will history need to record a second American Revolution ? ”
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , imagining herself as some sort of Delacroixian Liberty from the Land of the Lakes , urged her fellow Minnesotans to be “ armed and dangerous , ” ready to bust caps over cap - and - trade , I presume .
And between his tears , Glenn Beck , the self - professed “ rodeo clown , ” keeps warning of an impending insurrection by saying that he believes that we are heading for “ depression ” and “ revolution ” and then gaming out that revolution on his show last month .
“ Think the unthinkable ” he said .
Indeed .
FBI statistics show that there have been “ 1.2 million more requests for background checks of potential gun buyers from November to February than there were in the same four months last year . ”
That ’s hardly reassuring .
As Oliver Willis concluded , “ The right is quickly slipping back into its conspiratorial nutjob posture that it had during the Clinton presidency , seeing black helicopters and one world UN government under their beds at every turn .
As a friend of mine noted they were lunatics when the object of their ire was a white southerner .
One can only wonder what someone they perceive as a black muslim intent on installing Sharia law will prompt them to do .
And because these psychos form the activist base of the Republican party , congress will just encourage them . ”
Indeed , congressional Republicans already are encouraging them .
RIAA member Universal Music Group was forced to settle a piracy suit it had brought against Mavis Roy after suffering a bit of a setback in their prosecution : Mavis Roy did not own a computer when UMG first brought suit .
Advertisement
Roy , a New Hampshire resident , actually thought the letters she received from UMG 's lawyers were either a joke or a scam and did n't respond for several months .
Her reaction is pretty understandable ; the RIAA simply directed her to a site where she could pay her " debt " with a credit card ( which certainly seems like a scam ) and , again , Roy did not own a damn computer .
UMG had mistakenly sued her due to the vast deficiencies in MediaSentry , the anti-piracy software the RIAA uses to track down pirates .
MediaSentry incorrectly pinpoints IP addresses with not uncommon frequency , and this is obviously one such case .
Roy mounted a case and UMG was forced to settle out of court , for fear that any decision at all would result in a precedent that could mean future suits could be thrown out as well .
Unfortunately , the settlement does not include UMG paying Roy to apologize for being such a -holes about the whole thing , and neither side will receive any money .

A report posted on the Kentucky Justice & Public Safety Cabinet website mentions the Kentucky chapter of the Constitution Party .
The 2006 report , entitled “ Hate Crime and Hate Incidents in the Commonwealth , ” characterizes the paleoconservative political party as a patriot group and associates it with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations .
Click on the above image to view the document in PDF format .
The report cites “ hate crime ” statistics produced by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League , organizations that have made a cottage industry out of conflating the patriot movement and racist groups .
“ What remains of the Patriot scene today is generally harder core , with an increasing number of groups influenced by the racist and anti-Semitic Christian Identity theology favored by some American neo -Nazi groups .
Many others have embraced another radical theology , Christian Reconstructionism , ” the SPLC claimed in 2001 .
Patriots entertain “ outlandish conspiracy theories and childish fascination with guns , as a collection of nuts , people lacking basic reasoning skills whose arguments were naïve at best . ”
On February 20 , 2009 , the State of Missouri issued the “ MIAC Strategic Report : The Modern Militia Movement . ”
It specifically mentions former presidential candidates Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and the Constitution Party ’s Chuck Baldwin as potentially dangerous “ militia members . ”
MIAC profiled people opposing abortion , illegal immigration , the New World Order , the North American Union , income taxes , the United Nations , and other issues of concern to paleoconservatives and libertarians as possible terrorists .
The report was sent anonymously to Alex Jones and subsequently received national attention .
In response to negative publicity , Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder called on Governor Jay Nixon to place Department of Public Safety Director John Britt on administrative leave pending an investigation into the report .
The ADL and SPLC were instrumental in both the MIAC report and the Department of Homeland Security ’s report on “ rightwing extremism . ”
In April , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano delivered a keynote speech at an ADL conference in Washington .
She admitted the agency has received “ training ” on “ hate ” groups from the ADL .
The Kentucky report lists the Constitution Party in a table along with Take Back Kentucky , Ranch Rescue , and the Kentucky State Militia .
“ Patriot groups define themselves as opposed to the ‘ New World Order ’ or advocate or adhere to extreme anti-government or conspiratorial doctrines , ” a caveat below the table states .
“ Listing here does not imply that the groups themselves advocate or engage in violence or other criminal activities , or are racist .
This list was compiled from field reports , Patriot publications , the Internet , law enforcement officials and news reports .
Source : Southern Poverty Law Center . ”
If patriot groups are not racist , why are they included in a report that concentrates on “ hate crimes ” and the Ku Klux Klan ?
As previously noted on Infowars and Prison Planet , the SPLC and the ADL are in the business of demonizing the patriot and larger paleoconservative and libertarian movement as dangerous terrorists on the radical and “ extremist ” fringe of the American political landscape .
Including the Constitution Party — now considered a mainstream political party — in a report dwelling on the Imperial Klans of America and the neo- Nazi American National Socialist Workers ’
Party is part of a concerted effort to delegitimize and stigmatize the patriot movement .
In this KTVI Fox news piece , the ADL characterizes the Constitution Party as a “ fringe right - wing political party ” with “ extremist roots . ”
The Kentucky Justice & Public Safety Cabinet needs to remove this obvious and defamatory propaganda from its website immediately ( or at minimum remove mention of patriot groups from this SPLC - ADL produced report ) .
The Kentucky Justice & Public Safety Cabinet ’s office secretary may be reached at ( 502 ) 564-7554 .

Aidan Delgado applied for conscientious objector status in 2003 Hundreds of US armed forces personnel have applied for conscientious objector status since the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 - and military rights campaigners say the number is growing .
A report from the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) showed that 425 servicemen and women made applications for CO ( conscientious objector ) status between 2002 and 2006 .
Of these , 224 were approved but Bill Galvin of Washington 's Center on Conscience and War says the real number of applications is far higher because many are not recorded .
" Nobody knows exactly how many applications there have been because people apply at the local level and statistics are only kept on the cases that actually make it to the national level .
The real number is a lot higher .
" We also know that many people are conscientious objectors and find some other way to get out .
They never apply for CO status because it's not the easiest way .
" Some of them go AWOL , some can prove medical reasons or some may challenge their enlistment agreements .
So when people come to us we help them explore all their options . "
Stress
The centre is part of the national GI Rights Hotline which offers practical help and counselling to military personnel seeking to leave the armed forces .
" I think there 's also a link between the number of people dealing with issues of conscience and the rise in the number of cases of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , " says Mr Galvin .
" There 's a lot of research to suggest that when people start asking such questions it contributes to high levels of PTSD . "
Overnight I became a ' bad ' soldier
Aidan Delgado Aidan Delgado , 24 , attained CO status and was given an honourable discharge from the army after returning from deployment in Iraq .
He joined as an army reservist on the morning of 11 September 2001 , unaware that the terrorist attacks had just taken place .
" I straddled exactly the period when being in the reserves was a joke to being a deeply serious commitment and you were certain to be deployed , " he says .
He is now a law student at Washington 's Georgetown University but , at the time he enlisted , he was doing badly at school , felt confused about his life and thought the army would offer him some structure and discipline .
During his basic training he became a Buddhist and began to question his role in the military .
Hostile reaction " In 2003 I began the formal process of saying I can no longer participate in this .
My commander 's reaction was that I was trying to escape from the deployment ( in Iraq ) and overnight I became a ' bad ' soldier . "
Some of his comrades also reacted badly and Mr Delgado says he was attacked by a member of his unit when it became known he was applying for CO status .
" To have the knowledge that members of your unit disliked you so much that they would assault you was really tough .
" I think they were hostile not because of what I was doing but because of the implicit judgement on them .
It was as if I was saying ' I 'm too moral to do what you do ' or that I was looking down on them because they were a bad person . "
The number ( of objections ) is small relative to the Armed Forces ' total force of approximately 2.3 million service members
GAO report
It took 18 months for his application to go through , a process that involved a lot of paperwork , written essays about his beliefs and interviews with army staff culminating in a three - hour session with an investigating officer .
" He asked me if I would have fought Hitler .
My first response was that I do n't think you can project yourself into another historical person 's shoes - it 's paradoxical .
" But my other answer was that certainly I would have resisted Hitler .
I might have done so in 1929 or diplomatically in 1932 and that part of my pacifism and part of being a conscientious objector is preventing the need for violence . "
The report from the Government Accountability Office says the US Armed Forces recognise that service members religious , ethical or moral beliefs can change after joining the military and lead to a conscientious objection to war .
Exposure to combat or the death of a family member can trigger the change , it says .
But it also notes : " Despite the possible understatement in the number of applications for conscientious objector status , this number is small relative to the Armed Forces ' total force of approximately 2.3 million service members . "

In the late 1980's , the Friedmans - father and respected computer and music teacher Arnold Friedman , mother and housewife Elaine Friedman , and their three grown sons , David Friedman , Seth Friedman and Jesse Friedman - of Great Neck , Long Island , are seemingly your typical middle class American family .
They all admit that the marriage was by no means close to being harmonious - Arnold and Elaine eventually got divorced - but the sons talk of their father , while also not being always there for them , as being a good man .
This façade of respectability masks the fact that Arnold was buying and distributing child pornography .
Following a sting operation to confirm this fact , the authorities began to investigate Arnold for sexual abuse of the minor - aged male students of his computer classes , which he held in the basement of the family home .
Based on interviews with the students , not only was Arnold charged with and ultimately convicted of multiple counts of sodomy and sexual abuse of these ... Written by Huggo

But by the time it was being debated , my request to see the receipts of MPs ’ second home spending , which I first lodged in January 2005 , and which has led ultimately to the disclosures of the past two weeks , was already being investigated by the Information Commissioner .
The Times reports that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) is still selling your private name and address details to dodgy Private Wheel Clamping companies , despite their previous promises , after the previous scandal hit the media back in 2005 .
See the previous Spy Blog article and comments : DVLA database details sold to criminals - implications for the proposed National Identity Register
DVLA is selling drivers ' details to rogue wheel - clamping companies Ben Webster , Transport Correspondent The DVLA is selling drivers ' names and addresses to clamping companies that break industry rules by charging drivers more than £ 500 for minor parking breaches , an investigation by The Times has established .
The agency made more than £ 4 million last year by selling the details of 1.6 million drivers .
It sold 900 names and addresses to Newline Securities and Parking Control Management , both of which have repeatedly double - charged drivers for parking breaches and inflated bills by adding spurious charges . [...]
The agency has continued to sell drivers ' details to the companies despite being aware of their behaviour .
This contradicts the agency 's claim that it carefully vets companies seeking access to the vehicle register .
The agency also claims that it denies access to companies that have breached the industry code on parking enforcement . [...]
The DVLA claims that there are safeguards covering each approach .
Companies seeking automatic access must sign up to the British Parking Association 's ( BPA ) self - governing industry code . [...]
However , The Times has obtained evidence that the BPA fails to enforce its code and ignores evidence of breaches by its members , including Newline and PCM .
The owner of PCM , David Blake , sits on the BPA panel , which is supposed to ensure fair treatment for drivers .
That looks like a conflict of interest .
[...]
The BPA has admitted that PCM and Newline breached its code but it is refusing to suspend or expel either company .
The DVLA states on its website that " failure to comply [ with the BPA code ] could result in suspension and expulsion , and mean that they could no longer apply for information from the DVLA vehicle record " . [...]
Remember that there are plans to make your Driving Licence into a Designated Document for the purposes of the National Identity Register .
If the DVLA is ever allowed access to the NIR , then it is clear that all that information will simply be sold , in bulk , without any proper checks , to criminals or disreputable companies .

Much has been said and written in recent days about the way the demonstrators in Tehran have been utilizing new kinds of " social media " to challenge the Iranian theocratic regime .
Protesters blog , post to Facebook , and most intriguingly , coordinate their protests on Twitter , the messaging service .
On Twitter , young Iranians and their supporters post reports and links to photos from demonstrations along with accounts of street fighting and casualties around the country .
So will this revolution be twitted ?
Perhaps .
But in any case , with all the attention focused on Tehran ’s Twitter Revolutionaries , we should n’t forget the other impressive group of revolutionaries that has emerged in Washington just as the media started reporting on allegations about a rigged Iranian presidential election and angry protesters were gathering in Tehran .
I ’m referring here to the many brave U.S. lawmakers , op - ed columnists , television talking heads , think - tankers , and bloggers who are angry that President Barack Obama has refused to punish the ayatollahs in Iran by , say , bombing Iran into the Stone Age or doing a regime - change in Tehran .
Hence Republican senator and former presidential candidate John McCain  thank God for small mercies  is now criticizing the man who beat him last November for not talking tough with the Iranians like  I kid you not !
 former president George W Bush .
" Look , these people are bad people and I know that it was unpopular to call them part of an axis of evil or whatever it was , but we just showed again that an oppressive regime will not allow democratic elections , free and democratic elections , " McCain told reporters last week .
Yep .
President Obama should follow the footsteps of his predecessor , who certainly knew how to talk tough to Osama bin Laden ( and then let him get away to Pakistan ) and to Saddam Hussein ( and then generate a military fiasco in Iraq ) and to Iran ( and then help it emerge as a regional power ) .
So McCain , who during the campaign entertained an audience while singing " Bomb , bomb Iran " to the tune of an old Beach Boys hit , is now advising President Obama on doing his version of the " right thing " in Iran .
McCain is at least a war veteran .
Most of the other critics of Obama ’s policy of maintaining a distance from the political upheaval in Iran are veterans of the battles of the blogs that took place before and during the Iraq War .
They are so - called chickenhawks who continue to protect such neoconservative bastions as the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) and the Weekly Standard , and who not long ago were promising us that the Iraq War would be a " cakewalk , " and that Iraqis would greet Americans as liberators with garlands and sweets .
Now after that Iraqi Mission Not-Really Accomplished , they seem to be coming back to life , showing up once again on all the television news shows and authoring new op - eds for prestigious publications , despite the fact that much of their foreign policy agenda has been bankrupted and is now lying ruined on the sands of Mesopotamia .
Well never mind .
Now they suggest that America should exert all its power to lend a helping hand to former Iranian prime minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi as he and his supporters attempt to challenge the presidential election results , a move that will only play into the hands of the ruling ayatollahs and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who hope to portray Mousavi and the protesters as American stooges .
Ironically , these same American critics who now depict Mousavi as Iran ’s Gorbachev were warning on the eve of the Iran election that even if Mousavi won , the Americans would have no choice but to confront Iran over its nuclear military program and consider giving Israel a green light to strike that country ’s nuclear facilities .
But now they explain that Mousavi ’s election will ignite a democratic revolution in Iran and mark the start of a new era in the U.S. - Iran relationship .
Trying to make sense of the kind of intellectual gibberish that passes for foreign policy analysis in Washington these days , I recall Tweedledee and Tweedledum , those two silly characters from Lewis Carroll ’s Through the Looking - Glass .
The two were known for talking nonsense all the time : " This must be Thursday .
Never could get the hand of Thursdays , though on a whole , Thursdays have been pretty good . "
Their names derived from the expression " twiddling my thumbs , " which is to say they had nothing to do , like : " Oh , I ’m doing nothing but twiddling my thumbs . "
So let ’s forget about Twitter .
When it comes to the revived chickenhawks of Washington , the revolution will be twiddled .

Police questioned a group of suspected protesters who drove into London in a customised armoured car .
The vehicle was stopped outside the Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters in the City of London .
For Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , “ a combination of ignorance and arrogance ” under the Bush administration squandered countless diplomatic opportunities with Iran and so allowed it to forge ahead with its nuclear program .
Referring twice to Dick Cheney as “ Darth Vader , ” ElBaradei told me in an interview that “ U.S. policy consisted of two mantras — Iran should not have the knowledge and should not spin one single centrifuge .
They kept saying , wait , Iran is not North Korea , it will buckle .
That was absolutely a mistake . ”
Instead of building on Iran ’s Afghan help in 2001 , exploring an Iranian “ grand bargain ” offer in 2003 , or backing 2005 European mediation that hinged on the U.S. agreeing to sale of a French nuclear power reactor , “ We got Darth Vader and company saying Iran was in the axis of evil and we have to change this regime . ”
The result , ElBaradei said , was that instead of containing the program at a few dozen centrifuges , “ Iran now has close to 5,500 centrifuges , and they have 1,000 kilos of low enriched uranium , and they have the know - how . ”
Still , he dismissed the notion that Iran “ could go to a weapon tomorrow ” as “ hype , ” putting the time frame for that at two to five years .
Imagine if Roosevelt in 1942 had said to Stalin , sorry , Joe , we do n’t like your Communist ideology so we ’re not going to accept your help in crushing the Nazis .
I know you ’re powerful , but we do n’t deal with evil .
That ’s a rough equivalent on the stupidity scale of what Bush achieved by consigning Iran ’s theocracy to the axis of evil and failing to probe how the country might have helped in two wars and the wider Middle East when the conciliatory Mohammad Khatami was president .
Seldom in the annals of American diplomacy has moral absolutism trumped realism to such devastating effect .
Bush gifted Iran increased power without taking even a peek at how that might serve U.S. objectives .
So here we are , several thousand centrifuges on , with Iran getting what it has long craved : recognition of the regime from the Obama administration , relegation of threats and renunciation of the demand that enrichment be suspended as a condition for America ’s joining other major powers in nuclear talks with Iran .
That ’s salutary .
American realism is now essential .
It should heed ElBaradei ’s view : “ I do n’t believe the Iranians have made a decision to go for a nuclear weapon , but they are absolutely determined to have the technology because they believe it brings you power , prestige and an insurance policy . ”
I think it ’s almost certainly too late to stop Iran achieving virtual nuclear power status — something like Brazil ’s or Japan ’s mastery of the know - how without a weapon .
Iran ’s advances of the past eight years cannot be undone .
What can be transformed is the context Iran operates in ; that in turn will determine how “ virtual ” Iran remains .
One context changer was Obama ’s call for a nuclear - free world : it ’s hard to argue for nonproliferation without tackling disarmament .
“ You ca n’t have nine countries telling the likes of Iran nuclear weapons are dangerous for you , but we need to go on refining our arsenals , ” said ElBaradei , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 and ends his term later this year .
“ It ’s a different world . ”
He sees two years of U.S. - Iranian talks as needed , given the degree of mistrust , with “ every grievance on the table . ”
Here ’s one normalization scenario :
Iran ceases military support for Hamas and Hezbollah ; adopts a “ Malaysian ” approach to Israel ( nonrecognition and noninterference ) ; agrees to work for stability in Iraq and Afghanistan ; accepts intrusive International Atomic Energy Agency verification of a limited nuclear program for peaceful ends only ; promises to fight Qaeda terrorism ; commits to improving its human rights record .
The United States commits itself to the Islamic Republic ’s security and endorses its pivotal regional role ; accepts Iran ’s right to operate a limited enrichment facility with several hundred centrifuges for research purposes ; agrees to Iran ’s acquiring a new nuclear power reactor from the French ; promises to back Iran ’s entry into the World Trade Organization ; returns seized Iranian assets ; lifts all sanctions ; and notes past Iranian statements that it will endorse a two - state solution acceptable to the Palestinians .
Any such deal is a game changer , transformative as Nixon to China ( another repressive state with a poor human rights record ) .
It can be derailed any time by an attack from Israel , which has made clear it wo n’t accept virtual nuclear power status for Iran , despite its own nonvirtual nuclear warheads .
“ Israel would be utterly crazy to attack Iran , ” ElBaradei said .
“ I worry about it .
If you bomb , you will turn the region into a ball of fire and put Iran on a crash course for nuclear weapons with the support of the whole Muslim world . ”
To avoid that nightmare Obama will have to get tougher with Israel than any U.S. president in recent years .
It ’s time .
Last June , McClatchy reporter Tom Lasseter described how an unwarranted stay at Guantánamo had transformed a common Afghan criminal named Mohammed Naim Farouq into a dangerous , America - hating terrorist .
Farouq had no proven ties to the Taliban or al - Qaida when he was captured by US troops in 2002 , Lasseter wrote .
But during a year of " abuse and humiliation " at Guantánamo , he met and befriended " high - level militants " .
By mid-2008 , Lasseter reported , Farouq was a Taliban leader in eastern Afghanistan – radicalised by his experience , like a number of his compatriots .
Which brings us to the latest screw - up by the New York Times , committed on 21 May , eagerly pounced upon by former vice - president Dick Cheney later that morning , fingered as suspect by Talking Points Memo that afternoon and finally ( and firmly ) debunked by Times public editor Clark Hoyt this past Sunday .
That 's the short version .
Here 's the slightly longer one .
The 21 May story , by Elisabeth Bumiller , claimed that the Pentagon was preparing to release a study showing that 74 Guantánamo prisoners who had been freed – about one in seven – had " returned " to terrorism .
Bumiller 's story came amid rising tensions over President Barack Obama 's plans to close Guantánamo , and Cheney used the figure in his speech that day – the one he delivered as soon as the president had finished giving his own address on what to do with the remaining prisoners .
The Times ' story was gleefully received by the conservative Weekly Standard , which had run a story back in March claiming the Pentagon study was being kept under wraps so as not to embarrass Obama .
Later that day , though , Justin Elliott wrote at TPM Muckraker , one of the Talking Points Memo sites , that Bumiller had popped up on MSNBC and said that perhaps " returned " was the wrong word .
Noting the Times had dropped the suggestion of recidivism from its online version , Elliott wrote : " Bumiller and her editors seem to have realised the possibility that they might have gotten spun – though too late to change the front - page story in the print edition . "
Five days later , Elliott got hold of the Pentagon study and found that though it described former prisoners as having " re-engaged " in terrorism , it provided no evidence to back that up .
As best as Elliott could tell , the Pentagon 's data showed a recidivism rate of 5 % – one in 20 , a far cry from one in seven .
Others who had taken up terrorism upon being released from Guantánamo , the study showed , may never have engaged in terrorist acts before their imprisonment .
After a considerable amount of online goading , including a campaign by the media - watch group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting , the Times ran an editors ' note acknowledging the flaws last Friday .
Then , on Sunday , Hoyt weighed in , writing : " I think the difference between one in 20 and one in seven made it a much less compelling story that should have run inside , with stronger warnings that the Times had its doubts . "
As described by Hoyt , it appears that a considerable amount of messy journalistic sausage - making went into Bumiller 's story .
Bumiller is described as having doubts about the study but being essentially overruled by her editors .
Yet it has to be said that Bumiller herself is something of a recidivist .
In a March 2004 presidential debate among the Democratic contenders , Bumiller asked what may have been the dumbest question ever uttered in such a forum : " Really quick , is God on America 's side ? "
At the time , Bumiller 's question seemed like a faint echo of the insanity that had fallen over much of the American media following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 – insanity that was practically defined by Bumiller 's former colleague Judith Miller , whose credulous reporting on Saddam Hussein 's non-existent weapons of mass destruction and terrorist ties helped set the stage for war and disaster .
This time , at least , it did n't take years for the Times to come to terms with how it had been manipulated .
But there 's something especially troubling about this particular mistake , because it turns the truth upside - down .
Bumiller 's story played into the darkest fears promoted by Cheney and his fellow conservatives by making it appear that terrorists captured on the battlefield and sent to Guantánamo would resume their jihadist ways upon being released .
The far more disturbing truth , borne out by the Pentagon 's own figures , is that we are creating terrorists at Guantánamo .
What to do with those people is a horrendous dilemma for Obama .
But it is not a dilemma of his making .
Issa Khan , a former Guantánamo prisoner , was interviewed by McClatchy 's Tom Lasseter last year .
His words stand as both a warning and a rebuke .
" A lot of our friends are working against the Americans now , " he said .
" Because if you torture someone without any reason , what do you expect ? "
If you 've been waiting for a way to connect your Mini DisplayPort - equipped Mac to an HDTV via HDMI , Monoprice has got you covered .
The company has begun taking orders for its $ 14 Mini Display Port to HDMI Adapter , which are expected to begin shipping this Friday .
The adapter is most significant in that it finally allows protected HD content , like that available from the iTunes Store , to be displayed on an HDTV .
DisplayPort , mini or otherwise , supports the HDCP encryption scheme designed to " prevent pirating " of HD content .
Unfortunately for users of new Macs , most monitors do n't support the standard — but luckily HDTVs do .
Gizmodo got a unit to test and they say it works as advertised .
The adapter will transmit audio data along with video if a device 's Mini-DP supports it , however Apple 's implementation on all current Macs does not .
It should especially be useful to folks using a Mac mini as an HTPC , but also for folks hooking up a MacBook or MacBook Pro to watch occasional content as well ( hello , Hulu ) .
Monoprice is also known for its other display adapters that are usually far cheaper than Apple 's own options .
Everything Star Trek is new again as J.J. Abrams reboots the beloved franchise this weekend in theaters around the world .
Wired.com does a photographic comparison study of the old - school crew that manned the U.S.S.
Enterprise in the original TV series and the new , wet - behind - the - ears version .
The original update of the Enterprise , as seen in the first three Trek movies ( then rebuilt for a couple more ) , inspired much of the look of the new movie 's flagship .
Just ignore the astronomical odds against the new ( old ) Enterprise being built in an Iowa cornfield within easy driving distance of James T. Kirk 's childhood home .

The original James T. Kirk ( played by William Shatner ) enjoyed natural gravitas , warm lighting and a sturdy wood - and - leather command chair .
The new version ( Chris Pine ) boldly plays in the snow without a coat and survives bouts with killer CGI .

Spock Prime ( Leonard Nimoy ) was emotionless , calm and contemplative .
Zachary Quinto's version is more intense and driven .
He 's also so uptight that if he broke wind , glass would shatter .

The original Lt. Uhura ( Nichelle Nichols ) opened the door for generations of black actresses like her successor , Zoe Saldana .
But Saldana lacks 1960s
Uhura 's natural curves as , like most 21st - century actresses , she does n't appear to have eaten since 1974 .

Though he takes some unnecessary ribbing these days for coming out of the closet , George Takei's Sulu ( above , left ) was a sober and professional presence on the old Enterprise bridge .
John Cho ( second photo below ) follows up with the same basic performance .
Meanwhile , while the original Chekov ( Walter Koenig , above , right ) was originally brought in as a Russian navigator meant to look like a Beatle , Anton Yelchin 's version ( first photo below ) is a Russian technician meant to look like a poodle .

While the original Montgomery Scott ( James Doohan ) could hit the sauce occasionally , he was the best engineer in the fleet and a formidable commander when Kirk was off chasing green girlfriends .
The new Scotty ( Simon Pegg ) is used mostly for comic relief in Abrams ' Trek .

Alternate Star
Trek origin stories from novels and comic books use the dramatic tactic of having Kirk and Spock take an immediate dislike to each other .
The new version wanders down that same road , though the two heroes get on the same page in time to save the day .

In the '60s version of Trek , Dr. Leonard " Bones " McCoy ( DeForest Kelley ) was Kirk 's sounding board and conscience .
In Abrams ' Trek , McCoy ( Karl Urban ) is more of Kirk 's comrade and enabler .
We 'll see if the relationship grows in sequels .

Star Trek 's antagonists can take very different forms .
In Abrams ' reboot , Eric Bana plays Nero , a blood - thirsty , revenge - crazed Romulan villain .
The Kirk of years past took out plenty of alien scum like Nero , but he struggled against fuzzier , less - threatening foes like Tribbles .

The original cast of the U.S.S.
Enterprise was mature and seasoned — well into their five - year mission when fans caught up to them .
The new cast is filled with rookies , forced into action because Earth is in dire need — and because film executives decided moviegoers can't stand to watch anyone over 25 .

Gary M. Reback was fired from Bear Stearns in May 2008 as JPMorgan Chase bought the nearly collapsed investment bank .
The suit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on May 1 names Bear Stearns and JPMorgan as defendants .
Reback claims that even though Bear Stearns was on the verge of going under , he helped make millions of dollars for the Wall Street firm .
Reback also is suing for $ 1.1 million in severance pay he says Bear Stearns promised him .
Messages left Monday for Reback and his attorney 's Scarsdale home and for his lawyer , Jonathan S. Sack , were n't immediately returned .
JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said , " Mr. Reback is not owed any money . "
Refugees flee the military operations in Swat Valley , Pakistan .
* * *
By Farooq Sulehria
May 17 , 2009 --
The mass exodus from Swat is making headlines globally .
Over a million have been displaced .
This is the worst humanitarian crisis since the Rwanda tragedy in 1990s .
The explanation offered is that this is necessary to flush the Taliban out of Swat 's lush , green valley in Pakistan 's north .
This military operation , launched in order to stabilise the US occupation of Afghanistan and its so - called " war on terror " , is hardly mentioned in the corporate media .
On the contrary , major US newspapers have been invoking the fear that Pakistan 's nuclear weapons might fall into the hands of the Taliban .
Is this a story planted by the CIA ?
This is the fourth time in less than three years that the Swat area has been subjected to a military operation .
However the latest offensive is of a different character .
First , this military operation was hastily launched .
The United States threatened to use drones in Swat if Pakistan did not stop the Taliban from advancing into the neighbouring districts of Dir and Boner .
Second , it is not a mock operation .
This time the Pakistan army is targeting the Taliban .
Third , the mainstream media in Pakistan and the major political parties are openly supporting this military action .
Previously the mainstream Islamist and right - wing parties , including former prime minister Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) , were sympathetic to the Taliban and opposed targetting them .
This time around , the PML - N is siding with the ruling coalition , led by Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) .
The general public is turning against the Taliban .
The swing in the public 's perception was catalysed by a video showing the Taliban whipping a girl .
This shocked Pakistanis .
However Taliban spokesperson Muslim Khan defended the punishment and asserted that the girl should have been stoned .
While the media previously had been dominated by pro-Taliban anchorpersons and columnists , they are not siding with the Taliban this time .
Ridiculed as the ``Media Mujahidin '' , many pro-Taliban journalists have now begun criticising the Taliban .
However it is the liberals in the media who are proving to be the worst warmongers .
Back in 1999 they were the first to welcome the military takeover of Pakistan , hoping that General Pervez Musharraf would rid Pakistan of the fundamentalist " beards " .
Later , disillusioned by Musharraf , they pinned all their hope on Uncle Sam .
Ironically one finds far - left and Islamist parties on the same side of the fence : both oppose the military operation , but for different reasons .
Left and right
Islamist parties see an opportunity for themselves with the Talbanisation of the society .
Even if Islamists did not bag more than 4 % of the votes in the 2008 general election , they have been able to encroach on Pakistan 's democratic and social liberties .
Only a couple of weeks ago two elite colleges in Lahore , 400 kilometres from Swat , introduced campus dress codes .
Female students have been advised not to wear jeans and to dress ``modestly ' ' .
The far left , on the other hand , considers military action counterproductive .
The left views the Taliban as a threat to civil society and particularly the working classes .
But the threat can not be bombed out of existence .
In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , US forces drove the Taliban out of Kabul , but only temporarily .
Not merely are the Taliban back in Afghanistan , but Pakistan 's tribal areas and North West Frontier Province have gone over to the Taliban .
Pakistan 's leading left - wing group , the Labour Party Pakistan ( LPP ) , in a recent press statement opposing the military operation , declared : " The fight against religious extremism can only be successful insofar as the basic problems of the working class in social , political and economic fields are solved .
In addition to developing a system of free education with a secular syllabus for all , this must mean an end to feudalism , implementation of land reform and an end to the US occupation of Afghanistan . "
The military operation in Swat covers up the reality that the Pakistan military considers the Taliban an asset and is not willing to sacrifice that asset to please the USA .
While the army is flushing the Taliban out of Swat , the Jihadi infrastructure ( training camps , seminaries , newspapers , charities that front for the Taliban ) remain intact in other parts of the country .
Pakistan military part of the problem
The Jihadi infrastructure cannot be dismantled by any civil government because the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , the all - powerful intelligence wing of the Pakistan military , blocks all such attempts .
Ironically , the residents of Swat who are now displaced by the military 's ``Operation Rah - e - Haq 4 ' ' , upon reaching refugee camps find themselves hosted by Lashkar - e - Tayyaba ( LeT ) .
It was the LeT that engineered the terrorist attack on Mumbai last November .
Following at attack , the Pakistan government banned the LeT and the Jamaat - ud - Dawa ( JD ) , its charity front .
According to the Guardian newspaper , " The Falah - e - Insaniat Foundation ( FIF ) offers food , medical care and transport to villagers fleeing into Mardan district . "
Citing experts and some FIF members , the newspaper asserts that the group is merely the renamed relief wing of JD .
The FIF relief camp is located outside Sher Gur in Mardan , a few hundred metres from the border with Malakand , where the fighting is concentrated .
Present in the camp is Abdur Rauf , the FIF head and the former head of JD 's welfare wing .
Rauf told the Guardian that the group 's 24 - hour kitchens had fed 53,000 people in roadside camps and schools where people were living .
He added that a fleet of 23 mini-buses had transported victims from the battle zone .
Seven ambulances took the injured to hospital .
This is not for the first time that a militant outfit was prescribed but remained functional , simply under a different name .
Under US pressure , General Musharraf banned half a dozen groups , but all these outfits remain operative only with a name change .
The military refuses to give these outfits up for two reasons .
One , a substantial section of Pakistan military , particularly the ISI , has an ideological bond with the Islamist militants .
Second , the military wishfully plans to use these irregulars in a proxy force that can re-capture Kabul and keep things boiling in Kashmir .
As a matter of fact , the Taliban would not have been able to establish a foothold in Swat had they not been lent a helping hand by the army .
Most importantly is the fact that the Taliban has had a radio station for many years .
This radio played a crucial role in establishing Taliban control precisely because it gave it an effective method to transmit its propaganda .
In fact , Fazlulla , the Taliban warlords in control of Swat , earned the nickname Mullahs ' Radio .
For four years , the military was " unable " to locate the radio site or jam its transmission .
Meanwhile Mullahs ' Radio was threatening
Swat residents by issuing fatwas and intimidating opponents every day after morning prayers .
Hence the slogan gaining popularity is ``Yeh jo dehshatgardi hey Iss key peechay wardi hey ''( Behind all this terrorism is the military ) .
Why Pakistan 's military helped Talibanise Swat
In the wake of 9/11 the hawks in the Pakistan military developed the perspective of " defeating " the USA through a proxy - Taliban militia , the way the Red Army was driven across the Oxus River .
Thus , in a short - sighted and roundabout way , the Pakistan military brought Uncle Sam into Pakistan .
Under US pressure , General Musharraf 's regime took some cosmetic measures against Jihadi elements , but it did not touch the Taliban .
Every time it was asked to do more , some Arab militants were rounded up and sent to the Gitmo gulag .
However , because of his pro-US policies certain Jihadist elements turned against Musharraf and tried to assassinate him .
The Musharraf regime consequently targeted these elements but nonetheless kept patronising those willing to co-operate .
In order to wage a proxy war against NATO / US forces , the army helped the Taliban turn the tribal areas and districts of the North West Frontier Province into their base camp .
The locals resisted the Taliban takeover but their outdated guns proved no match for the modern arsenal at Taliban 's disposal .
These Taliban - controlled regions became a launching pad for Jihadist activities in Afghanistan .
The White House , irritated at the dual role played by Pakistan military , decided to take matters in its own hands .
Since 2006 it has been using drones to attack suspected Taliban hideouts in the tribal areas .
During the waning months of US President George Bush 's office these attacks became more frequent but have escalated since the beginning of Obama 's presidency .
" When in doubt , escalate the war is an old imperial motto " , Tariq Ali reminds us .
In fact , the drone strikes against Pakistan bring to mind US President Richard Nixon 's desperate bid to salvage the Vietnam War by bombing and invading Cambodia .
More than 700 people have been killed in US drone attacks on Pakistan since 2006 , with 164 killed in 14 attacks under Obama 's watch .
These drone attacks are further fueling anti-US sentiments .
Instead of finding an exit strategy in Afghanistan , the Obama administration is practicing an Iraq - style surge .
But it is the US presence in the region that will sustain the conditions that breed Talbanisation .
The longer the USA stays in Afghanistan , the longer the Taliban 's defeat will be delayed and the suffering of the poor masses prolonged .
For those lucky enough to survive the bombs dropped by the Pakistan military in Swat , they will also have to deal with the possibility of having their throats slit by Taliban hit squads .
Or they have the option to become refugees in their own country .

In January 1975 , Popular Electronics ran a cover story about a new computer for hobbyists .
The Altair 8800 came as a kit and cost $ 439 ( the equivalent of $ 1,778.58 in today ’s dollars ) .
It came with no on - board memory .
You programmed it by entering Intel 8080 opcodes by hand via a series of switches on the front panel .
Buying 4 k of memory , the ability to read in programs from paper tape , and a teletype interface would increase the price 6 fold .
You had to solder the thing together by hand .
By comparison with the big university and corporate mainframes it was basically useless .
But Popular Electronics was the Make Magazine of its day and engineering schools had begun to require their graduates to learn some programming , so Forest Mims and Ed Roberts , the two guys in Albuquerque who ’d put the Altair together , figured they could probably sell a few hundred in the first year to this emerging group of hackers avant la lettre .
They took 1,000 orders in the first month .
Six months after the release they ’d sold 5,000 .
By October of that year their company had 90 employees .
Why was the Altair such a runaway success ?
After all , by comparison to the cutting edge computers of its day , it was underpowered and extremely difficult to work with .
The answer is ownership .
The Altair offered bourgeoning hackers their first chance at a computer that would be fully and completely theirs .
They could take it home , throw it up on their work bench , take it apart , put it back together and try to get it to do totally new unimagined things .
They could program their Altairs to play Fool on the Hill through a transistor radio .
They could build a board to let the Altair drive a color TV in Times Square .
They could start a small company to sell programming languages for it .
They could get together with their fellow Altair owners to share programs and cool hacks .
This last point ca n’t be emphasized enough .
The Altair crystallized growing local groups of DIY computer enthusiasts like the Homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley .
It gave them an outlet for their energies and an example of what could be done .
It made them believe that their incredible fantasy of having their own computers might really come true .
And after that , there was no stopping them .
This new generation of hackers dedicated itself with an almost religious zeal to spreading the idea of computer ownership across the world .
They invented the personal computer — a whole industry dedicated to the notion that computers could make life better and work easier for everyone , not just huge institutions .
The Homebrew Computer club alone included the founders of Apple , Ozborne ( builders of the first portable ) , and a raft of other industry pioneers .
Today , the world of physical computing closely resembles the personal computer industry circa 1975 .
We ’ve been around for a few years struggling around the edges with tools and products that were designed , priced , and packaged for serious industry , but we have n’t made any money and we have n’t moved the world .
That ’s about to change .
Recently , our Altair arrived .
It ’s called the Arduino .
This is 2009 so instead of being built by two engineers in Albuquerque , it was built by an open source international cabal of programmers and professors .
A lot of people complain that it ’s underpowered and overpriced ( even though it only costs $ 8.64 in 1975 dollars ) .
But you do n’t need special hardware to program it .
It lets you do all the basic tasks with just a line or two of perfectly comprehensible code .
And there ’s a thriving community of people busily using it to do all the useless , fun , creative things they ’d always dreamed of if only they could get their hands on a computer that could sense and control the world around it .
They ’re using it to teach houseplants to call for help if they need watering .
And they ’re using it to play music on glasses of water .
If the Arduino is the Altair of physical computing then what will be its VisiCalc ?
What will be the killer application that makes the physical computer of the future a necessity for business .
If the Arduino is the Altair , what will physical computing ’s Mac look like ?
I do n’t think anyone today knows the answers to these questions .
But the answers are coming .
In the next few years , physical computing has as much of a shot at changing the world as technologies ever get .
And this is the time to get involved .
Unlike the web , personal computer , and green energy industries , physical computing is a space where two guys in a garage can come along and invent something that will touch billions of people around the world without anyone else ’s permission .
That ’s because what ’s needed in physical computing is not advanced research , massive infrastructure investment , or huge production facilities .
What ’s needed is close attention to applying the existing technology to solving human - scale problems .
Microcontrollers and sensors , CNC milling machines and laser cutters , GPS devices and accelerometers need to be transformed into tools that regular people can use to improve their daily lives : to make themselves more connected to the people and places around them , to entertain , educate , and distract them .
In 30 years , when people tell the story of the Physical Computing Revolution and how it changed the world , what will they say about you ?

President Ilyumzhinov of the Republic of Kalmykia won his first chess championship at 14 .
Since then chess has kind of been his thing .
So much so that despite his small , barren and unusually resource - free nation of 300,000 existing mostly in a state of abject poverty , he has ploughed many millions into developing a neighbourhood sized city of chess worship .
In an interview with journalists in 1997 he revealed that he had once been abducted by aliens .
" They took me from my apartment and we went aboard their ship , " he said .
" We flew to some kind of star .
They put a spacesuit on me , told me many things and showed me around .
They wanted to demonstrate that UFOs do exist . "
SAPARAMUT " TURKMENBASHI " NIYAZOV
1940 - 2006
A year after he gained the presidency Mr. Niyazov declared himself Turkmenbashi or ' leader of all Turkmen ' which kicked off an extended period of crazy .
An early piece of policy centred around changing the names of anything he liked .
The capital 's airport , the port city of Krasnovodsk , countless streets and roads throughout Turkmenistan , the month of January and a 670 pound meteorite were all renamed Turkmenbashi .
He changed April and the name of the nation 's staple bread to Gurbansoltan edzhe , his mother 's name and he made it law that his image appear on every single watch , clock and bottle of vodka produced in the country .
Niyazov also banned car radios , recorded music , lip - syncing , dogs , the ballet , opera , long hair or beards , computer games and news presenters from wearing makeup .

Ramzan Kadyrov is the current president of Chechnya and he 's only 30 .
He started his career early , leading a unit of Chechen separatists in the first Chechen War when he was just 16 , but switched to the Russian side when he was 23 going on to use connections from this period to grease his slide into power .
Some of the decenting voices that he has silenced are : Anna Politkovskaya , the Russian journalist who reportedly had evidence of Kadyrov 's participation in the torture and was found shot dead in her apartment in 2006 ; a Chechen commander , Movladi Baisarov who was shot and killed in an ambush by Kadyrov 's police several hundred meters from the Kremlin also in 2006 ; and Umar Israilov , a former bodyguard of Kadyrov who was shot to death while he was on the run from his old boss in January this year after testifying against him in a Strasbourg court .
Kadyrov is also an animal enthusiast .
He owns a tiger , a bear , a wolf and a lion .
He also has a golden gun - see top picture .
LEOPOLD II OF BELGIUM
1835 – 1909
In 1876 , sick of all of the other colonial powers having all the fun , Leopold II disguised a private holding company as an international scientific and philanthropic charity , hired famous explorer Henry Morton Stanley , and went over to the Congo to take a chunk of the pie that was Africa for Belgium .
He seized an area 76 times larger than his home nation , renamed it the Congo Free State , and set about exploiting the vast quantities of rubber the region offered .
Discipline was barbarous .
Leopold 's enforcers can be credited with starting the practice of limb amputation as shock tactic that became the hallmark of the more vicious African rebellions of the twentieth century .
After a visit to the land missionary John Harris wrote to Leopold 's chief agent saying :
" I have just returned from a journey inland to the village of Insongo Mboyo .
The abject misery and utter abandon is positively indescribable .
I was so moved , Your Excellency , by the people 's stories that I took the liberty of promising them that in future you will only kill them for crimes they commit . "
The Encyclopaedia Britannica pegs the total number of casualities that resulted from his regime at somewhere between 8 and 30 million .
For a sense of scale : the total estimated number of military deaths from all sides involved in World War 2 was 25 million .
Useful TRUTH
Truth and Contradiction in Angels & Demons
Added by viorel on May 29 , 2009 | Visited by 8703 | Voted by 54 persons
Those who saw the latest Hollywood thriller based on the best seller of Dan Brown entitled \ " Angels and Demons\ " probably asked themselves the question whether Vatican can really be annihilated by antimatter that was stolen from a secret laboratory , being produced by the Large Hadron Collider .
In reality , throughout the movie , the physicists try to tell us about the existence of antimatter in real life .
It is worth mentioning that scientists consider antimatter as something that can be used for other purposes than just massive destruction of things .
After the release of the blockbuster , researchers from over 30 colleges , universities and national labs located throughout the United States and Canada are leading public lectures on the topic about antimatter .
They communicated about what antimatter represents , what is the Large Hidron Collider and what is interesting about the particle physics .
At the same time researchers tell about the truth behind the movie and the fact that it features quite a few controversial statements from the field of science .
Angels and Demons is a movie that highlights the long - lasting disagreements that take place among religion and science .
For those who still have n\'t seen the movie it would be interesting to know that there is an ancient secret brotherhood that calls itself Illuminati , which existed for many years but disappeared several centuries ago , reappeared once again and its members decided to kidnap four priests ( one of whom is to be elected the next pope ) and most importantly they had stolen 0.25 grams of antimatter that was obtained with the help of LHC .
The latter was turned on at CERN - the abbreviation stands for the European Organization for Nuclear Research .
Then the stolen antimatter was hidden somewhere in Vatican , world \'s smallest but powerful country .
Only Robert Langdon can save Rome , finding the antimatter and stopping it from colliding with matter , which would lead to a catastrophic explosion that could erase , according to the movie , the entire Vatican and a part of Rome .
The truth is that 0.25 grams of antimatter is really more than enough to erase from the globe the whole city of Rome .
There is a part in the movie where Robert Langdon says that Vatican City could be \ " destroyed by light\ " .
In this case the main character of the movie is somewhat correct in his affirmation : there is a distinction between a particle and its antiparticle and that is that the two feature opposite electric charges .
When they collide , these opposite electric charges annihilate into 2 photons .
Taking into consideration the formula e=mc^2 , 0.25 grams of antimatter includes 45 trillion joules , which has the energy of not less than 10 kilotons of TNT , which in its turn is about 14 kilotons of the Hiroshima atomic bomb .
It seems that the energy from normal matter was not taken into consideration , since in reality 1 / 4 of antimatter has twice the amount of 5 kilotons that were mentioned in \ " Angels and Demons\ " .
Another truth is that such a small amount of antimatter requires an enormous task .
At present there \'s just one single producer of antimatter , Fermilab , which generates about 2 nanograms of antiprotons per year .
Taking into consideration such a speed , scientists would need 100 million years to create 1/4 gram of antimatter .
In order to create antimatter , particles should be accelerated at a speed close to the speed of light and then they need to smash into each other .
Such a difficult process needs a huge amount of energy .
Due to the fact that to create antimatter requires much more energy than it actually unleashes during annihilation , it poses no real threat , thus it can \'t be used as a source of energy .
Besides , in the movie the antimatter is stolen , being placed in a canister , and transported in another location , which is actually not possible .
The truth is that antimatter cannot be transported real life .
There \'s more truth and fiction in Angels and Demons .
The movie shows CERN as some kind of secret science laboratory .
In reality it is a well - known scientific organization with 9,000 scientists from 20 countries .
In addition , the CERN laboratory in the movie is found 100 meters underground , in the same high - radiation tunnel where the Large Hidron Collider is located .
The real offices are located in safe buildings , constructed above the ground .
Here are a few other discrepancies : in the book the director the CERN is a bald scientist in a wheelchair .
In reality the director is an ordinary German , who can walk and has hair .
In addition , the book describes scientists working at CERN flying to their workplace in a futuristic X - 33 plane , while real scientists go to work by coach .
It is obvious that people who worked on Angels and Demons wanted to make a science - fiction movie that would be in Hollywood tradition .
Despite the discrepancies and myths mentioned in the book and the movie , the story might still wake up the interest to physics ( especially in particle physics ) among a lot of people , who will probably try to find the truth about antimatter after watching the movie .
Aon will replace another insurer , AIG , on Manchester United 's shirts
Manchester United has signed a four - year shirt sponsorship deal with the insurance giant Aon Corporation .
Aon will replace troubled US insurer AIG , which is restructuring itself having received a $ 150 bn ( £ 109 bn ) bail - out from the US government .
The new sponsor will appear on Manchester United 's shirts from the start of the 2010 / 11 season .
Aon is based in Chicago and specialises in reinsurance , which is the selling of insurance to other insurers .
Neither Manchester United nor Aon has announced the terms of the deal or how much it is worth .
AIG paid £ 14 m a year for its four - year deal , which ends in May 2010 .
There have been reports that Aon 's deal could be worth as much as £ 80 m over four years .
Aon said it hoped that its relationship with Manchester United would help to improve its brand recognition .
It pointed out that after its first year sponsoring the team , AIG had become the 47th most recognised global brand and had jumped from number 84 to number 30 on Barron 's list of most respected companies .

Users benefit when Google can keep data , said Larry Page .
Forcing Google to delete user data after six months could dent its ability to predict pandemics such as swine flu , said the search giant 's co-founder .
Larry
Page said he thought more debate was needed around the issue of storing user data .
The European Commission wants data ditched after six months but Mr Page said there were benefits to users .
" More dialogue is needed [ with regulators ] , " he told UK journalists at a Google event in Hertfordshire .
Data clash
He said Google 's ability to plot and predict potential pandemics would not be possible if the firm had to delete search data after six months .
" When we released data about Mexico flu trends we had a whole debate , " he said .
" We were worried we would cause panic .
But we decided the benefits outweighed the cost . "
Mr Page said deleting search data after six months was " in direct conflict " with being able to map pandemics .
In a demo to journalists , Google showed that it had been able to spot a potential pandemic ahead of government agencies because it was using search data .
On its website about spotting flu trends , the firm says : " Our up - to - date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and pandemics . "
Mr Page said the less data companies like Google were able to hold the " more likely we all are to die " .
The European Commission has argued that holding on to search data runs the risk of third parties being able to build profiles of individuals even when some identifying information is deleted .
In September 2008 , Google said it would anonymise data after nine months following pressure from Europe on the issue .
Previously it had kept data , including IP addresses and search terms , for 18 months .
European advisers recommend that search engines should not keep data for more than six months .
Previously , Google argued that it had to keep data for longer to comply with requests for help from law enforcement agencies .

Lars Lih , the author of Lenin Rediscovered : " What Is to Be Done ? " in Context , which offers a new interpretation of Lenin 's 1902 book , comments on the news that Hugo Chávez has a new book ready to present to Barack Obama .
HUGO CHÁVEZ , the president of Venezuela , has announced on Venezuelan television that the next time he meets with President Barack Obama , he will give the American head of state a short book written in 1902 by one Lenin , entitled What Is to Be Done ?
A surprising announcement .
The last time Chávez showed his willingness to fill out Obama 's reading list , he gave him a topical book on the situation in Latin America .
But what topical interest can be found in a book over a century old , written under the drastically alien circumstances of Tsarist Russia ?
Besides , many of us will remember being taught about this book in a poli sci or history class .
Is n't What Is to Be Done ? a " blueprint for Soviet tyranny " ?
Is n't this the book in which Lenin expressed his contempt for workers -- or , in any event , his worry that the workers would never be sufficiently revolutionary ?
These worries , so we are told , led Lenin to advocate a party of " professional revolutionaries " from the intelligentsia that would replace a genuine democratic mass movement .
All in all , is n't What Is to Be Done ?
something of an embarrassment for the left - - a book much better forgotten than thrust into the hands of world leaders ?
Obama and Chavez shake hands at the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad in April
I am not privy to Chávez 's thoughts on the matter .
But having recently spent several years of my life retranslating What Is to Be Done ?
into English and recreating the historical context for Lenin 's book , I feel qualified to clear up some of the confusions and misconceptions that surround the book .
In preparation for my study Lenin Rediscovered , I read every piece of writing mentioned by Lenin in What Is to Be Done ?-- and since Lenin was intensely polemical , I had a lot of ground to cover .
I had to become well versed not only in the intricacies of the infighting among the Russian revolutionaries , but also in the ways in which the Western European workers parties inspired Lenin and his comrades .
I had to get a sense of the exact political conjuncture in Russia in the few months in late 1901 and early 1902 during which Lenin hastily penned his treatise .
A blueprint for Soviet tyranny ?
On the contrary , What Is to Be Done ?
represents a heritage that had to be rejected before Soviet tyranny could be established .
An expression of elitist " worry about workers " ?
On the contrary , Lenin goes way overboard in his sanguine optimism about the workers ' revolutionary fervor .
Lenin 's organizational suggestions are all about reconciling the contradictory imperatives of avoiding arrest in the underground while simultaneously creating extensive roots in the Russian worker community .
As for topicality - - well , we shall see .
AT THE turn of the 20th century , Tsarist Russia was run by a religiously sanctioned elite that was hostile even to the idea of political freedom -- that is , freedom of speech , of press , of assembly , of autonomous organization .
The Tsarist regime showed itself unable and unwilling to adjust to the challenges imposed by a world that was rapidly globalizing and putting pressure on Russia in terms of military rivalry , economic performance and the subversive political ideals wafting in from the West .
To prove how incompetent they were , the Tsarist government got itself involved in a war with Japan and bungled it big time .
More and more social groups in Russia were losing patience with the Tsar 's pretensions -- not only such traditional troublemakers as the intellectuals or the national minorities , but also groups that the government had always assumed to be highly loyal , such as the peasants and even many opposition - minded landowners and businessmen .
The industrial workers , in particular , were rapidly being politicized , thus becoming the most dangerous opposition force .
All this inchoate and uncoordinated discontent could explode if the right spark fell in the right place -- which is why Lenin and his friends called their underground newspaper The Spark ( Iskra ) .
The ultimate aim of their newspaper was to make the anti-Tsarist revolution happen .
An underground newspaper published abroad could hardly provide directly leadership to the many discontented groups throughout the Russian empire .
What it could do was make people aware that they were not alone , that discontent everywhere was growing , that Tsarism was becoming desperate , and that one group at least -- the industrial workers -- was increasingly ready to take to the streets , not only for their own sectional economic interests , but to obtain political freedom for all of Russia .
Once society as a whole was imbued with this awareness , Tsardom was doomed .
Such was the reasoning of Lenin and his friends .
Today , of course , any such strategy would have to be adapted to forms of communication not dreamed of in 1902 .
But this strategy leads to a paradox .
Lenin , the committed Marxist socialist , the future head of the Soviet one - party state , making political freedom in Russia his most urgent priority ?
Strange as it may seem -- and ignored as it is by most Western historians -- this is exactly the case .
Lenin made political freedom his top priority precisely because he was a dogmatic Marxist socialist .
Like many other Russians of his generation - - both the intelligentsia and the workers -- Lenin was inspired by the stirring example of the massive and powerful German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) .
The SPD was a mass , worker - based party , officially committed to a Marxist brand of socialism , showing radical opposition to the German establishment , and growing in numbers and influence all the time .
The outlook of the German party was based on the core Marxist proposition that socialism can only be introduced by the workers themselves , and so the main activity of the party consisted of a ceaseless round of propaganda and agitation , both aimed at spreading the socialist word among the workers .
Russian Social Democrats were green with envy at the massive social democratic press , the noisy and crowded rallies , the eloquent denunciations by elected socialist deputies in parliament .
But in order to emulate the German socialists , they needed something that did n't exist in Russia : political freedom .
Strange but true : the central aim of Lenin 's political career , at least up to the outbreak of war in 1914 , was obtaining political freedom for Russia by revolutionary overthrow of the Tsar .
IN A short book written around the time of What Is to Be Done ? in which he explained the platform of Russian Social Democracy to a popular audience , Lenin entitled one section " What Do the Social Democrats Want ? " and answered his own question thusly : " Russian Social Democrats , before anything else , aim at achieving political freedom " ( Lenin 's emphasis ) .
As Lenin further explained in a newspaper article , " Without political freedom , all forms of worker representation will remain pitiful frauds , the proletariat will remain as before in prison , without the light , air and space needed to conduct the struggle for its full liberation . "
Lenin 's commitment to this goal was no secret to his political rivals .
One of the first reviews of What Is to Be Done ? appeared in the underground journal of anti-Tsarist liberals .
The anonymous author ( possibly the liberal party 's most famous leader , Paul Miliukov ) explained why Lenin opposed the so - called " economists " within the Russian socialist movement :
The Russian proletariat -- said the advocates of [ economism ] -- had not yet matured enough to understand specific political demands ; all that it was capable of now was the struggle for its economic needs .
The Russian worker did not yet feel any need for political freedom .
[ But ] in a country that has a despotic regime such as our Russian one , in a country where such elementary democratic rights as the right of free speech , assembly and so on , do not exist , where each worker strike is accounted a political crime and workers are forced by bullets and whips to return to work -- in such a country , no party can restrict itself to the narrow framework of an exclusively economic struggle .
And Mr. Lenin justly protests against such a program .
Lenin's Menshevik critics even accused Lenin of going overboard about political freedom , and thereby increasing the danger of letting the workers be politically exploited by the bourgeois liberals .
In order to make his strategy plausible , Lenin had to make a strong case that the Russian workers were chomping at the bit to fight the Tsar and demand political freedom .
And in fact , at the very time Lenin was writing What Is to Be Done ?
the growing militancy of the workers was evident to everyone -- not least to the Tsarist authorities , who even tried setting up their own loyal worker movement in order to combat more revolutionary - minded organizations .
If Lenin really expressed the views attributed to him in standard textbooks -- pessimism , even despair , about the revolutionary mood of the workers -- no one would have taken him seriously .
As it was , in the words of the anonymous liberal reviewer , " this book is being read with passion , and will continue to be read , by our revolutionary youth . "
For many , all of this will seem literally unbelievable , like arguing that Adolf Hitler was a philo - semite .
We are talking about the Lenin , are n't we , the one who founded a state noted for its lack of political freedom and its oppression of workers as well as all other groups ?
Yes , it 's the same Lenin alright -- which means that What Is to Be Done ?
does not provide a ready - made explanation for the evolution of the Soviet system .
Indeed , an accurate reading of Lenin 's 1902 book makes developments after 1917 harder to explain .
THIS IS not the place to tackle the necessary explanations .
But here 's a suggestion .
The same exalted estimate of worker creativity and revolutionary fervor found in his writings of 1902 led Lenin in 1917 to believe that the dire economic crisis of that year could be easily solved simply by letting the workers smash the repressive state and forcing the capitalists to do their proper job .
The result was an accelerated leap into complete economic collapse , and this , in turn , necessitated some dictatorial back - pedaling .
I merely throw this out , but I believe that this kind of explanation is superior to the typical B - movie script in which Lenin rubs his hands , Boris Karloff - style , and cries , " At last -- my chance to take political freedom away from the workers , as I have always dreamed ! "
Lenin 's organizational suggestions only make sense in the context of the aims that I have just outlined : spreading the word under repressive conditions .
Thus , Lenin 's central organizational value was not conspiracy , but konspiratsiia .
The aim of a conspiracy ( zagovor in Russian ) is to be invisible until the proper time .
The Russian word konspiratsiia -- one that had been used in Russian socialist circles for over a decade -- means the fine art of avoiding arrest , while spreading the word as widely as possible .
The konspiratsiia underground was an underground of a new type , worked out bit by bit by local Russian praktiki who dreamed of applying the logic of the German SPD under the inhospitable conditions of Tsarist repression .
Lenin 's organizational plan was not an original creation out of his own head , but rather a codification of the logic inherent in the konspiratsiia underground improvised by local activists .
This applies in particular to Lenin 's most notable terminological innovation , the " professional revolutionary . "
In my new translation , I render Lenin 's term as " revolutionary by trade , " which brings out the underlying metaphor better .
But the essential point is that the professional revolutionary was a functional necessity of a konspiratsiia underground , and thus all Russian underground parties adopted the term and relied heavily on the type -- that is , on activists devoted full - time to underground activity and ready to move from place to place so that local organizations did not fall into demoralizing isolation .
The concept of " professional revolutionary " has nothing to do with the intelligentsia vs. the workers .
The reliance on professional revolutionaries is precisely what does not separate Lenin 's Bolsheviks from other underground factions .
A famous line from Lenin 's What Is to Be Done ? is : " give us an organization of revolutionaries -- and we will turn Russia around ! "
This is a reference to Archimedes ' lever , a device able to give almost infinite power under the right circumstances to a single person : " Give me a place to stand and I can move the earth ! "
In Lenin 's application , a properly organized party was the place to stand , but the lever itself was the cascading revolutionary awareness that would amplify the message of a small group of activists and turn it into a revolutionary onslaught against the autocracy .
Lenin focused on organization because everything else -- the enthusiasm of the masses , the universal hatred of the autocracy - - was at hand .
How topical are the suggestions found in Lenin 's 1902 book ?
Let the reader judge .
The situation Lenin faced was something like this : there existed a potentially wide social consensus in opposition against a religiously sanctioned regime , noted both for its hostility to political freedom and its growing inability to respond to paramount social needs in a globalizing world .
Some of the potential opposition groups have a greater capacity than others to combine militant activity on the streets with focused political aims that can unite the opposition .
There also exist committed group of activists with international contacts , ready to go underground to spread the word .
These are the parameters of the problem as Lenin saw it .
Of course , any solutions to similar problems today cannot follow the details of the one Lenin came up with .
But they can emulate the creative communication strategies and the focused organizational improvisations that made Lenin 's book such a hit -- not only for the Russian undergrounders in 1902 , but for the likes of Hugo Chávez .
Enlarge AP Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin says David Letterman's " knocked up " joke about her daughter was " perverted . "
Sarah Palin says David Letterman owes an apology to young women across the country for his joke about her daughter .
The Alaska governor appeared on NBC 's Today show Friday , continuing a feud with the CBS Late Show funnyman over his joke earlier this week that Palin 's daughter got " knocked up " by New York Yankee third baseman Alex Rodriguez during their recent trip to New York .
Palin also said she does n't believe she should be automatically considered the front - runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 .
Asked by Matt Lauer whether Letterman owed her daughter an apology , the former vice presidential candidate broadened it .
" I would like to see him apologize to young women across the country for contributing to kind of that thread that is throughout our culture that makes it sound like it is OK to talk about young girls in that way , where it 's kind of OK , accepted and funny to talk about statutory rape , " she said .
" It 's not cool .
It 's not funny . "
Letterman has said his joke was about Palin 's 18 - year - old daughter Bristol , who is an unwed mother ( no name was used ) .
Problem was , the Alaska governor was traveling with 14 - year - old Willow .
Palin said it took Letterman time to think of the " convenient excuse " that he was talking about Bristol instead of Willow .
Letterman said on his show Wednesday that he would " never , ever make jokes about raping or having sex of any description with a 14 - year - old girl . "
He said he was guilty of poor taste .
Palin said Friday that it was time for people to rise up against Letterman 's form of humor .
" No wonder young girls especially have such low self - esteem in America when we think it 's funny for a so - called comedian to get away with such a remark as he did , " she said .
" I do n't think that 's acceptable . "
The National Organization for Women placed Letterman in its " media hall of shame . "
" I think what David Letterman said is terrible , is inappropriate and nobody should be making jokes about the sexual activities of teenagers , whether they are the daughters of politicians or not , " said Kim Gandy , NOW president .
" Comedians in search of a laugh should really know better than to snicker about men having sex with teenage girls or young women half their age , " NOW wrote on its website .
Rodriguez is 33 ; Letterman is 62 .
Palin said there was a double standard where the media treats President Barack Obama 's family as generally off - limits , while her family was the butt of jokes during last fall 's presidential campaign and beyond .
She 's a favorite target of Letterman's .
The Late Show host made 95 jokes about Palin after the election through March 15 — more than Jay Leno , Conan O'Brien , Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert combined , according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs .
Palin denied that it was also in bad taste for her spokeswoman , Meghan Stapleton , to say Thursday that Palin would not appear on Letterman 's Late Show because " it would be wise to keep Willow away from David Letterman . "
" Maybe he could n't be trusted because Willow has had enough of this type of comments and maybe Willow would want to react to him in a way that maybe would catch him off - guard , " she said .
" That 's one way to interpret such a comment . "
The controversy may wind up giving both Palin and Letterman attention at a time both could use it .
Palin is considered a potential future candidate for national office , and standing up for her family could make her a hero to her fans .
She was asked on Today whether last year 's candidacy effectively puts her in the position of front - runner for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 and replied , " Oh , heck no . "
Letterman is in the second week of his new competition with NBC's O'Brien , and won by a solid margin Thursday night in Nielsen Media Research 's overnight ratings measurement of the nation 's top media markets .
Letterman has a strong shot at beating the " Tonight " show for a week in these ratings for the first time since 2005 .
On his show Thursday , Letterman joked that Palin had called to invite him on a hunting trip — the punch line no doubt a reference to former Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shooting a friend while hunting .
His other references to the controversy were more oblique .
When guest Denzel Washington said he would get in trouble with Obama for making a joke about the president 's big ears , Letterman clearly had something else on his mind .
" You are n't in the kind of trouble I 'm in , " he said .

Enlarge By Junji Kurokawa , AP Mitsubishi President Osamu Masuko poses with the company 's newly unveiled electric car , the i-MiEV , in Tokyo .
TOKYO ( AP )  Mitsubishi Motors ' electric vehicle is twice as expensive as popular hybrid cars by rivals Toyota and Honda , but Japan 's No. 4 automaker said Friday the i-MiEV will help it survive increasingly intense global competition .
" With the electric vehicle , we will challenge global players , " said Mitsubishi President Osamu Masuko at a news conference where the company rolled out the electric model .
The i-MiEV is powered solely by electricity , and can be recharged from a regular home socket .
The four - seater vehicle can run up to 100 miles after charging seven hours at 200 volts .
" It is a zero-emission vehicle .
It does not rely on oil , which is different from hybrid cars , " Masuko said .
A hybrid car switches between a gasoline engine and an electric motor to boost mileage .
Initially , Mitsubishi aims to target local governments and companies , and hopes to sell 1,400 units of the electric car for the fiscal year through March 2010 , mostly in Japan .
Mitsubishi also aims to sell 250 units abroad , mainly in Britain and other European countries , in the current financial year .
Individual buyers in Japan can place orders for the car in July , with deliveries starting in April 2010 .
It also plans to sell the car in China and the United States , but Masuko gave no details .
Mitsubishi's i-MiEV costs 4.59 million yen ( $ 47,560 ) , more than twice as much as Toyota 's Prius hybrid , which is just over 2 million yen ( $ 20,700 ) , or Honda 's Insight , which starts at 1.89 million yen , the cheapest hybrid on the market .
Masuko acknowledged the high price is a major hurdle to encouraging people to buy the i-MiEV , which stands for Mitsubishi innovative electric vehicle .
( The initial " i " does n't have any particular meaning , the company says . )
" This is not the price that ordinary people can easily buy .
But as we increase our production , we aim to cut the price below 2 million yen , " he said without elaborating further .
Masuko noted that i-MiEV Japanese consumers can receive hefty subsidies and pay no tax under a government program promoting the use of ecological vehicles .
With the help of government subsidies , the car costs 3.209 million yen , down 43 % from the original price , or about $ 33,000 .
The subsidy program for electric vehicles runs from April to next March .
But an official at the trade ministry said the government plans to extend the program .
Also , electric cars , as well as hybrids , are tax - free for three years in Japan .
Masuko said the company had spent more than 40 years to develop the i-MiEV , but declined to say how much the company had invested in its development .
" We are looking ahead .
We look at the global auto market of 10 or 20 years later from now , " the president said .
" We are in the midst of global auto competition , and we should not be left behind . "
Various automakers are racing to develop electric cars amid rising oil prices and concerns about global warming .
Malaysia 's national carmaker Proton and Detroit Electric , a Netherlands - based company , plan to make electric cars by early next year .
U.S. - based Tesla Motors has a prototype electric car that is scheduled to be produced by 2011 .
Toyota said it plans to sell electric vehicles in the U.S. by 2012 , while Nissan said it will market electric vehicles in Japan and the U.S. after April 2010 .
Globally , Mitsubishi hopes to sell 15,000 units for the year through March 2012 .
But it can only make a profit on the electric car if it produces 30,000 units per year , Masuko said .
" We want to reach that level as early as possible , " he said .
He added that the company is considering making a commercial electric vehicle .
Mitsubishi's share price has jumped recently on hopes for the new car .
On Friday , it rose 2.3 % to close at 175 yen after surging almost 12 % Thursday .

Imagine a group of 100 fisherman faced with declining stocks and worried about the sustainability of their resource and their livelihoods .
One of them works out that the total sustainable catch is about 20 % of what everyone is catching now ( with some uncertainty of course ) but that if current trends of increasing catches ( about 2 % a year ) continue the resource would be depleted in short order .
Faced with that prospect , the fishermen gather to decide what to do .
The problem is made more complicated because some groups of fishermen are much more efficient than the others .
The top 5 catchers , catch 20 % of the fish , and the top 20 catch almost 75 % of the fish .
Meanwhile the least efficient 50 catch only 10 % of the fish and barely subsist .
Clearly , fairness demands that the top catchers lead the way in moving towards a more sustainable future .
The top 5 do start discussing how to manage the transition .
They realise that the continued growth in catches – driven by improved technology and increasing effort – is not sustainable , and make a plan to reduce their catch by 80 % over a number of years .
But there is opposition – manufacturers of fishing boats , tackle and fish processing plants are worried that this would imply less sales for them in the short term .
Strangely , they do n’t seem worried that a complete collapse of the fishery would mean no sales at all – preferring to think that the science can’t possibly be correct and that everything will be fine .
These manufacturers set up a number of organisations to advocate against any decreases in catch sizes – with catchy names like the Fisherfolk for Sound Science , and Friends of Fish .
They then hire people who own an Excel spreadsheet program do “ science ” for them – and why not ?
They live after all in a free society .
After spending much energy and money on trying to undermine the science – with claims that the pond is much deeper than it looks , that the fish are just hiding , that the records of fish catches were contaminated by being done near a supermarket – the continued declining stocks and smaller and smaller fish make it harder and harder to sound convincing .
So , in a switch of tactics so fast it would impress Najinsky , the manufacturers ’ lobby suddenly decides to accept all that science and declares that the ‘ fish are hiding ’ crowd are just fringe elements .
No , they said , we want to help with this transition , but …. we need to be sure that the plans will make sense .
So they ask their spreadsheet - wielding “ advocacy scientists ” to calculate exactly what would happen if the top 5 ( and only the top 5 ) did cut their catches by 80 % , but meanwhile everyone else kept increasing their catch at the current ( unsustainable rate ) .
Well , the answers were shocking – the total catch would be initially still be 84 % of what it is now and would soon catch up with current levels .
In fact , the exact same techniques that were used to project the fishery collapse imply that this would only delay the collapse by a few years !
and what would be the point of that ?
The fact that the other top fishermen are discussing very similar cuts and that the fisherfolk council was trying to coordinate these actions to minimise the problems that might emerge , are of course ignored and the cry goes out that nothing can be done .
In reality of course , the correct lesson to draw is that everything must be done .
In case you think that no - one would be so stupid as to think this kind of analysis has any validity , I would ask that you look up the history of the Newfoundland cod fishery .
It is indeed a tragedy .
And the connection to climate ?
Here .
I ’ll finish with a quotation attributed to Edmund Burke , one the founders of the original conservative movement :
“ Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little . ”
See here for a much better picture of what coordinated action could achieve .
The crust of a neutron star is strong enough to hold up ultra - dense mountains , a new simulation suggests .
As the star spins , these bumps could produce ripples in the fabric of space that may be detectable from Earth ( Illustration : Casey Reed / Penn State University )
The crust of neutron stars is 10 billion times stronger than steel , according to new simulations .
That makes the surface of these ultra- dense stars tough enough to support long - lived bulges that could produce gravitational waves detectable by experiments on Earth .
Neutron stars are the cores left behind when relatively massive stars explode in supernovae .
They are incredibly dense , packing about as much mass as the sun into a sphere just 20 kilometres or so across , and some rotate hundreds of times per second .
Because of their extreme gravity and rotational speed , neutron stars could potentially make large ripples in the fabric of space – but only if their surfaces contain bumps or other imperfections that would make them asymmetrical .
A number of mechanisms have been proposed to create these bumps .
The stars could , for example , gobble up material from a companion star .
Bulges could also bubble up over hotter areas of the stars .
Advertisement
In theory , these bulges could be stable on the outer surface of the star .
Neutron stars are thought to be made up of a soup of neutrons covered with a solid crust .
The crust is composed of crystals of neutron - rich atoms .
“ But one of the big unknowns for all that work is the strength of the crust .
Can you really support a mountain , or will the crust just collapse under the weight ? ” says Charles Horowitz of Indiana University in Bloomington .
Few defects
Since laboratory experiments cannot replicate the extreme conditions on the surface of a neutron star , astronomers have largely assumed that the crust ’s strength would be similar to that of the strongest substances on Earth .
But in new computer simulations , Horowitz and Kai Kadau of the Los Alamos National Laboratory show the crust of a neutron star is much stronger .
Materials like rock and steel break because their crystals have gaps and other defects that link up to create cracks .
But the enormous pressures in neutron stars squeeze out many of the imperfections .
That produces extraordinarily clean crystals that are harder to break .
A cube of neutron star crust can be deformed by 20 times more than a cube of stainless steel before breaking .
Breaking point
But the atoms in neutron star crusts are pulled together much more tightly than in steel , so it takes 10 billion times as much pressure to push it to the breaking point , Horowitz told New Scientist .
Benjamin Owen of Pennsylvania State University in University Park says the simulations firm up previous suspicions that neutron star crusts might be stronger than astronomers had been estimating .
“ There was sort of some hand - wavy hints about that a few years ago , but this is really the first thorough calculation , ” he says .
The stronger crust means a neutron star can support a larger bulge than thought – a “ mountain ” could rise some 10 centimetres above the surface , stretching over several kilometres .
Stronger signal
Now , “ all else being equal , the maximum height of a ‘ mountain ’ on a neutron star is now 10 times what we thought , ” Owen told New Scientist .
That would produce gravitational waves with 100 times the energy as those previously calculated , which could boost the likelihood that ground - based experiments like the US Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) could spot the signals , he added .
The simulations could also shed light on starquakes , the reverberations triggered when intense magnetic fields tear open the crust of a neutron star .
A stronger crust means these quakes can produce even more energetic gamma-ray flares and gravitational waves , Owen says .

And do n't forget , the second T is silent .
In better economic times , Santa Clarita mortgage broker Fred Arnold relied on a home equity line of credit if his cash flow was uneven and he needed to cover payroll .
But when home sales crumbled last fall , there was no such backstop for the business .
His home was still worth more than the mortgage , but his bank was retrenching and had shut down the credit line .
So Arnold sold his house , used some of the proceeds to keep his business afloat and bought a smaller home .
“ I thought about cashing out my retirement money and the college savings for the kids , but that was n’t the way to go , ” Arnold said .
He and his wife are happy in the smaller home , Arnold added , and his home loan business is on more solid ground , thanks to a recent wave of refinancings .
Advertisement
That makes Arnold , president of the California Assn. of Mortgage Brokers , a lucky guy compared with hosts of small - business owners who relied on their housing wealth to start companies , buy equipment and manage payrolls .
No longer buoyed by the housing boom , many now find their businesses and homes sinking in the backwash from the easy - money era .
Even in the best of times , bank financing has not been easy to find for owners of start - ups , who instead typically rely on “ the three Fs -- family , friends and fools , ” as Alton W. Do of the Oakland Business Development Corp. puts it .
No wonder , then , that using home equity credit lines and cash - out refinancings for business purposes was widespread during the good times .
After all , 95 % of small - business owners also own their own homes , according to a survey late last year by the National Federation of Independent Business .
To get cash for business expenses , one - third of California small - business owners took out exotic , high - risk products , such as those that required little proof of income or allowed borrowers to pay so little that their loan balances rose , said accounting Professor Samuel D. Bornstein of Kean University of Union , N.J .
Advertisement
Bornstein , who has studied the issue extensively , predicts the business owners , many now far underwater on their loans , could shed 2.1 million jobs in the state over the next four years , creating even more problems than the initial wave of subprime mortgages .
“ The second tsunami is particularly going to inundate small businesses , ” Bornstein said .
In Southern California , many immigrants refinanced their homes to start such enterprises as food deliveries to restaurants and home remodeling services , said Namoch Sokhom , director of business development for the nonprofit Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment in downtown Los Angeles and El Monte .
These people , many with limited English skills , had no financial track records in this country that would allow them to get bank loans , Sokhom said .
Instead , lenders advised them to raise capital by refinancing with adjustable - rate mortgages or using home equity credit lines , he said .
Advertisement
The idea of using a house to finance a business caught on in the ethnic communities , said Sokhom , 60 % of whose clients are immigrants from Asia or Latin America .
“ People were saying that if you do n’t do it you are crazy , you do n’t know what ’s going on , ” he said .
“ And they said if you ca n’t pay when the loan resets , you just refinance again . ”
What Sokhom calls the “ foreclosure crisis ” among his clients started last year , when gasoline prices shot up .
“ Many of them came to us and said , ‘ We can not do any more deliveries because every trip out we lose money . ’
Many of these people , when they bought a truck , used their home equity or an equity loan outright to buy the truck , ” Sokhom said .
“ Now when the business goes sour , they can not pay the mortgage also . ”
Advertisement
Others , like mortgage broker Arnold , have had their home equity credit lines cut off because of falling housing prices .
For people in the home improvement business , that has meant no access to funds to buy materials and pay workers until the job is complete and they are paid , Sokhom said .
The evaporation of mortgage - related credit is part of a broader pullback by lenders in the recession .
Businesses that had counted on bank financing have been finding it harder to get .
The Federal Reserve reported last month that U.S. banks had tightened their standards for lending to small businesses for 10 consecutive quarters .
The trend intensified throughout last year , peaking in the fourth quarter , when 74.6 % of senior lending officers in a Fed survey reported making it more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit to fund payrolls , buy equipment and finance other operational needs .
Advertisement
The trend eased slightly in the first quarter of this year , with 69.2 % of the lending officers saying their banks had tightened credit for small businesses .
But the lenders also reported that small - business demand for commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit was down sharply as the downturn took its toll and the gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 6.1 % .
No wonder , then , that both small - business owners and the public “ remained pessimistic , ” as the Small Business Administration said in a recent quarterly report on the economic climate .
“ Poor sales and access to credit are major issues . ”
The National Federation of Independent Business survey found that of the small - business operators who owned homes , 26 % had mortgaged the residences to provide capital for the business .
Answering a separate question , more than 10 % said they had pledged their homes as collateral to buy other business assets .
Advertisement
That ’s a far greater number than those who use SBA loans , the government - guaranteed loans made by banks and credit unions .
“ Only about 5 % of people seeking business loans use SBA , ” said Robert A. Borden , an SBA regional spokesman in San Francisco .
“ The majority use personal funds , borrow from friends and relatives , or use credit cards . ”
Those seeking SBA loans usually wind up dependent on their home equity in any case .
That ’s because the government generally requires that business owners provide collateral to personally guarantee the loans along with the government guarantees .
For most business owners , that means pledging their homes to back the loans , Borden said .
If a loan goes into default , the SBA guarantee kicks in only after the bank recovers what losses it can by going after the home or other personal assets .
Advertisement
The SBA , trying to encourage lending , recently dropped some of its fees and increased its guarantees from 75 % or 85 % of loans to 90 % .
And a program called SBA Express , which provides lenders with reduced guarantees , allows banks in some circumstances to waive the demand that borrowers post collateral .
But there ’s no such thing as easy money these days :
As banks tighten the credit spigot , SBA - guaranteed loans are expected to drop to between 75,000 and 80,000 this year from 110,000 last year , a decline of as much as 32 % , Borden said .
The requirement to pledge a home or other personal asset to get banks to write SBA loans has put such loans beyond the reach of some otherwise well - established business owners .
A.J. Gilbert , owner of Luna Park restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles , said that in the past he managed to get SBA loans for his businesses without providing a personal guarantee .
Advertisement
But when Gilbert went looking recently for financing for a new restaurant , Henry ’s Hat , that he is opening on Cahuenga Boulevard near Universal Studios , no bank would lend him money when he told them he did n’t own a home and he was n’t willing to pledge his personal assets .
In the end , Gilbert obtained about $ 250,000 in financing through the Valley Economic Development Center , a Los Angeles nonprofit .
But that ’s not an option for most people because the amount of funds available at such nonprofits is limited .
The development center made $ 6 million in loans last year , up from $ 4 million the year before but a minuscule amount compared with the demand for small - business financing .
“ Most people who want to borrow from a bank for SBA money will put their houses up as collateral , ” Gilbert said .
And that ’s become a lot harder to do in today ’s depressed real estate markets .

For the first time , scientists have used genetic modification to increase the levels of multiple , rather than single , nutrients in a crop .
The first corn produced through the technique has n't yet been tested for dinner - table safety , but if it succeeds , it may signal the development of a new , super - nutritious generation of GM foods .
" The major message of the paper is that it 's possible to engineer crops with multiple nutrients , " said study co-author Paul Christou , a plant biochemist at Spain 's University of Lleida .
" If you look at other nutritionally enhanced GM crops , up until now people have only been able to increase levels of one nutrient or vitamin . "
An estimated 40 to 50 percent of the world 's population suffers from nutrient deficiencies .
The reasons for this are complex and sometimes political , but often involve reliance on a few staple crops that do not provide the nutrient balance common to mixed diets in the developed world .
Both conventional plant breeding and the high - tech activation of dormant genes are useful for adding some traits to crops , but they can't provide a sufficient nutritional boost .
Neither can traditional forms of genetic engineering .
When researchers attempt to add more than one new nutrient pathway , the genes tend to become scrambled in subsequent generations .
The approach used by Christou 's group debuted last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the same journal that published the latest corn research on Monday .
It involves the bombardment of seed genomes with metal particles coated with desired nutrient - boosting genes .
This produces a variety of different genomic configurations , some of which prove to be stable .
The researchers hope it will be more helpful than traditional techniques of nutritional genetic modification .
" We 're aiming to produce transgenic plants in which you can provide as many nutrients as possible in one and the same seed , " said Christou .
Christou 's team tested the technique on a variety of corn common in South Africa that 's known to produce low levels of beta carotene .
Low levels of the nutrient can lead to blindness .
The resulting plants had double the usual amount of folate , sixfold levels of ascorbate and 169 times more beta carotene .
At that level of expression , a single serving of corn can provide a recommended daily beta carotene intake .
The researchers are now experimenting with the addition of genes that enhance production of vitamin E , iron , zinc , calcium and other micronutrients , said Christou .
The study " shows the potential of this transgenic technology for accumulating genes that lead to micronutrient - enhanced crops , " said Rodomiro Ortiz , a researcher at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center .
Further studies are needed to see if the new nutrients are correctly metabolized by humans , and if the plant is environmentally and toxicologically safe .
According to Christou , the research was funded entirely by public money .
The team is trying to convince holders of patented techniques used in their process to allow researchers in the developing world to freely develop the technology .
A model for this is the intellectual property guidelines of beta - carotene–enhanced Golden Rice .
" This is not a commercial story , " said Christou .
" This is aimed at people in developing countries . "

It is illegal for a woman in NI to have an abortion except if her life is at risk .
More than 1,000 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for an abortion last year , according to official figures .
The total of 1,173 for 2008 is down on the figure of 1,343 for 2007 .
The Department of Health report also showed that 4,600 women travelled from the Republic of Ireland , down slightly on last year .
Of the women who travelled from Northern Ireland most were aged in their 20s but 86 were under 17 .
Abortion is illegal in Northern Ireland , except when the mother 's life is at risk .
Betty Gibson chairwoman for the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children in Northern Ireland welcomed the fact that the number of abortions was down by 170 on the previous year but said that a great deal more needed to be done to help women facing crisis pregnancies .
The family planning association ( FPA ) in Belfast said they welcomed the fact that the number of abortions had fallen .
However , FPA director , Audrey Simpson said : " We do n't know how accurate these statistics are .
" Women are giving false addresses , they are travelling to countries outside of the UK for abortions and we are seeing a rise in women buying early medical abortion products online . "
There were 195,296 abortions in England and Wales in 2008 compared with 198,499 in 2007 , a fall of 1.6 % .

Forget demi-celebs like Ashton Kutcher ( who ? ) , National Treasures like Stephen Fry or even bona fide media moguls like Oprah Winfrey - these days the real pioneers of Twitter are doing it from 350 miles above the Earth 's surface .
Nasa astronaut Mike Massimino has sent the first Twitter message from space - telling a quarter of a million followers that , well , he 's enjoying it up there .
Astro Mike 's first twitter message from space
In case you can't read the picture , the message reads :
" From orbit : Launch was awesome !!
I am feeling great , working hard , & enjoying the magificent views , the adventure of a lifetime has begun ! "
Massimino , who was on board the Atlantis when it launched from Cape Canaveral earlier this week , is the first in a string of astronauts who are going to be using social media tools like Twitter and YouTube from aboard the shuttle and international space station in the coming months .
Except ... well , it 's not quite what it seems .
Etan Horowitz of the Orlando Sentinel explains that there 's no live connection : instead , Astro Mike must compose his message on a computer and then beam the message in an email down to ground control .
Some lucky Nasa goon then gets to pick up his message and paste it into Twitter , where it becomes visible for all of us on the internet .
Of course , Twitter has been used to document the ups and downs of space travel before : most notably in the form of the Mars Phoenix account , which saw a stream of in - character messages from the interplanetary rover ... until it all went wrong in the frigid Martian winter .
But Massimino 's Twitter - by - proxy situation is n't just because there 's no internet aboard the shuttle , though : Nasa 's very careful about the messages about it that reach the public .
I asked Ariel Waldman , the founder of Spacehack.org what was going on : she said that something like this would most likely require many levels of approval from inside Nasa itself , and that messages are probably carefully monitored for any unwanted content .
No chance , then , that we 'll ever see astronauts telling us the ugly truth about life among the stars : " Bloody boring up here : space toilet 's broken and now the computer 's playing up .
It keeps saying ' I 'm sorry , Dave , I can't do that '.
WTF ?! "
Global health hit the philanthropic jackpot in recent years .
About four times more aid flowed into developing countries in 2007 than in 1990 .
But a paper published in The Lancet suggests the nearly $ 22 billion donated in 2007 missed many of the world ’s most deserving countries and diseases .
“ We know there ’s a lot of money , ” says Christopher Murray , director of the University of Washington ’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and co-author of the study that tracked both the sources and destinations of aid .
“ But we also know there ’s huge variation in the amount of money per unit of health need . ”
Murray lived in Niger as a kid , a country ranked by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as the world ’s 28th most needy country and home to one of the highest childhood death rates .
The development funding for Niger , however , is well below that of wealthier countries like Namibia , which receives “ 10 to 15 times more aid per year of lost life , ” he says .
Niger is one of 12 countries on the list of the 30 most burdened by disease that are not also among the 30 receiving the most health aid .
The report also concludes that more than 23 percent of all aid has gone toward HIV / AIDS , while diseases like tuberculosis and malaria — with combined burdens greater than that of HIV / AIDS — receive less than a third of that amount .
As Murray explains , the “ massive expansion of money for global health ” starting in the 1990s had a lot to do with the “ reaction of governments and citizens to the HIV epidemic . ”
The Seattle - based team analyzed funding from aid agencies in 22 developed countries over the 17 - year span , adjusting for the 2007 dollar .
The U.S. topped the final list with about half of all governmental and private global health funding .
That rank belies the country ’s “ miserly ” reputation in some quarters , Murray says .
Though it ’s also true that U.S. donations ranked fifth , when calculated as a fraction of national income .
Seattle ’s own Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributed more than any other private philanthropic organization : 4 percent of all health assistance in 2007 .
( The foundation also helped fund the study , although Murray notes that the institute operates as an “ independent entity . ” )
This careful counting of resources — where they came from and where they ’re going — could significantly improve the impact of aid , according to the authors .
No one had kept thorough tabs before .
Private donations , now about a third of all funds , were nearly invisible .
The study “ represents a phenomenal amount of legwork , ” says Ruth Levine , vice president of the nonprofit Center for Global Development in Washington , D.C. “ It reinforces the general pattern that most people in the field are aware of .
The major new information is on the private side . ”
In addition to private philanthropies , non-governmental organizations and businesses have also increased their influence in global health .
“ It ’s a dramatically more complicated arena today , ” Murray says .
“ There ’s a much bigger set of actors with different backgrounds and agendas that are active in global health . ”
Many of these key players are in Seattle for meetings this week , including the “ Health 8 ” — a meeting modeled after the G - 8 , an annual forum of world leaders .
Representatives from the WHO , the World Bank , the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Malaria and Tuberculosis , UNICEF and the Gates Foundation are there .
The aid landscape today is bleaker than in 2007 , with funding under pressure amid the global economic downturn .
Making better use of the money available is more important than ever .
“ A pretty large share of the conversation is likely about worries whether and how funding levels can be sustained , ” says Levine .
“ There ’s no question that it ’s helpful to have this kind of comprehensive information . ”
As I ’ve confessed here before , I ca n’t stand to throw things away .
Sometimes , that causes some storage problems .
Other times , though , it means inadvertently collecting an awesome stash of fun fabric scraps !
Let ’s focus on those times .
Even if you ’re careful to only choose organic , sustainable fabric options , there ’s a carbon footprint that goes along with any new materials : from production to shipping to your trip to the fabric store , all of that adds up .
If you ’re not a scrap - saver now , give it a shot !
You ’ll be surprised at how fast those bits and pieces accumulate , especially if you sew on a regular basis .
Not only does sewing with scraps keep that fabric out of the waste stream , it ’s super duper fun !
Here are a bunch of great projects you can make using those odds and ends .
Even teensy scraps do n’t have to go to waste .
Just quilt those bad boys together until you have a piece that ’s the size you need !
What sorts of fun things have you guys made out of fabric scraps ?

North Korea 's official mouthpieces are crowing about a successful nuclear weapons test .
But how do we know what really happened ?
By checking the seismic data , scouring the satellite images – and sending in the " Constant Phoenix . "
Measurement and signature intelligence – a .k.a.
MASINT – is one of the key disciplines for detecting a nuclear event .
It starts with seismic data .
The U.S. Geological Survey yesterday reported an earthquake in North Korea that measured 4.7 in magnitude .
That 's more powerful than the tremors that resulted from North Korea 's first nuclear test in 2006 – which the U.S. Geological Survey estimated at 4.2 ( the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization gave it 4.0 ; The South Koreans put it between 3.58 and 3.7 ) .
Seismic measurements , however , do n't provide a direct calculation of yield .
As our own Jeffrey Lewis commented after the first North Korean nuclear test , " estimating the yield is tricky business , because it depends on the geology of the test site . "
Helpfully , though , the event took place near Poongkye - ri in North Hamkyong Province , which , as China 's Xinhua news agency notes , is the same area where the North Koreans conducted the first nuclear test on Oct. 9 , 2006 .
So in terms of geography , we may have something of an apples - to - apples comparison .
Figuring out if a seismic event is an earthquake or a bomb blast is relatively easy .
Scientists do more than look at the strength of seismic impact .
They also examine the wave patterns from seismic sensors , to spot the difference between nuke - inspired tremors and earthquakes .
__"
__In highly simplified terms , in an earthquake , the ground starts shaking slowly as plates slide against each other , and then the seismic activity slow picks up as the ground really starts to move .
In an explosion scenario , the initial blast is extremely power­ful , and the subsequent shaking of the ground grows progressively less severe , " * How Stuff Works * explains .
Of course , seismic data is not the only information we might have .
If , for instance , there is venting from the test site , that would mean there is a radioactive plume that could also be measured .
That would help rule out the use of conventional explosives to simulate a small nuclear bomb .
In addition , one wonders if there are any clandestinely based sensors around the North Korean test site that would help give some more precise information .
Satellite or aerial images overhead can also provide some clues by probing the layout of the test site ( and if it happens , spot any serious venting . )
And let 's hope that somewhere , somehow , someone is collecting human intelligence inside the North Korean nuclear program .
You can bet that the U.S. Air Force Technical Applications Center ( AFTAC ) , which conducts nuclear treaty monitoring and nuclear event detection , is pretty busy with this one .
They 've got a tanker aircraft , dubbed the " Constant Phoenix , " equipped with air - samplers and filters which can pick out the signature particles of a nuclear plume .
( Think ionized xenon particles , to start . )
During the Cold War , America maintained a whole fleet of these airplanes .
Now , there 's only a single one of the aircraft left .
In 2006 , it flew near North Korea , to confirm Pyongyang 's first nuclear blast .
No doubt , it 's been busy again .

Dame Judi plays tough - talking M in the Bond films Every film in which actress Dame Judi Dench swears results in complaints , the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) has said in its annual report .
A handful of film - goers objected to her use of an expletive in 12A - rated Bond movie Quantum of Solace , but the complaints were " expected " , it said .
The body , which certifies films , DVDs and games , has updated its guidelines .
Releases will be vetted for issues of prejudice for the first time alongside violence , swearing and sexual content .
More rigorous Issues of race , gender , sexuality and disability will be taken into account when the BBFC issues certificates .
Under the new guidelines , a DVD box set of US comedy series Friends has been given a 12 rating instead of a PG because of the single use of the word spastic .
The organisation , which has reviewed its guidelines for the first time in four years , has said that the tone and meaning will come under scrutiny as well as what appears on screen .
It says that some releases which fall between two certificates could now be pushed into a more rigorous classification .
The Dark Knight 's 12A rating was criticised Rules about horror films have been tightened in the 12 and 12A category , meaning that 2001 release The Others , starring Nicole Kidman , would now be given a higher certificate .
The BBFC came to their conclusions after consulting 8,700 people .
It said that in the last year it received 853 e-mails and letters about its classifications .
The decision to give hard - hitting film The Dark Knight a 12A certificate generated the most public concern , with 364 complaints being received by the BBFC .
It put the complaints about one minor swear word in Quantum Of Solace down to the " Judi Dench factor " .
" This beloved actress plays M , Bond 's tough - talking boss .
However , it was her tough talking which upset the viewers , " it said .
" Almost every time Dame Judi swears in a film , regardless of its category , we can expect a number of complaints . "
BBFC president Sir Quentin Thomas also expressed concerns that children are able to access explicit material on the web too easily .
He added that efforts to regulate content were difficult because many sites are operated from outside the UK .

Code editors for Windows are numerous , but it seems that only a few of them are really worth using .
After all , it can take a while to really get into the groove of an editor and tweak all the settings to your tastes , so you 'd better find one you like !
I should mention that the features I 've called out for each editor are only the prominent ones ; obviously , there are many more .
Also , just because I 've mentioned a feature on one editor and not another does n't mean the second one does n't have the feature .
So let 's get to it !
I 've arranged them from least to most expensive .
Notepad ++
http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net
v 5.3.2 | Free
This is probably the best free text editor for Windows out there ; with support for simple things — like syntax highlighting and folding — all the way up to FTP , Notepad + + should tick most of the boxes .
I 've used the editor as my main editor quite a bit , and one of my favourite features is File Status Auto - detection : when NP ++ is made the active program , it will check all currently open files for changes and let you know if any file has been updated / deleted .
Notepad ++ is based on the Scintilla editing component .
JEdit
http://jedit.org
v 4.20 | Free
Jedit is rather ugly in my opinion , but it has a decent feature set ; as a Java program , it 's actually multi-platform .
It offers syntax highlighting for over 130 languages .
The website says it supports folding , but I could n't get that to work ( although it does highlight the opposite bracket ) .
Jedit has a plugin repository , which may give the editor a bit more functionality .
Notepad2
http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html
v 3.0.20 | Free
Notepad2 is also based on the Scintilla editing engine , but it 's much simpler than Notepad ++.
It bills itself as being fast , light - weight , and Notepad - like , and offers syntax highlighting for a variety of languages .
There 's no installation for this editor : just unzip and run .
There are a few modified versions ( with more features / languages ) available .
Programmer 's Notepad
http://pnotepad.org
v 2 0.9.926 | Free
Programmer 's Notepad has a similar interface to that of Notepad2 , although it does support having multiple files open at once .
It supports bookmarking , folding , and highlighting , but other than that , there is n't too much to mention .
Crimson Editor
http://www.crimsoneditor.com/
v 3.7 | Free
Crimson Editor offers macro support and the ability to execute external programs .
It has the ability to edit remote files , using a built - in FTP client ; there 's also a spell checker and a neat ' column select ' mode .
ConTEXT
http://www.contexteditor.org/
v 0.98.5 | Free
ConTEXT supports many languages , both programming and human ; it also gives you the ability to define your own custom languages .
It does file comparing and exporting to HTML , and includes some interesting behaviour for projects .
Another neat thing : ConTEXT remembers where your cursor is when you close a file , and puts it back there when you re-open the file .
SciTE
http://gisdeveloper.tripod.com/scite.html
v 1.77 | Free
SciTE is a really simple text editor , based on Scintilla .
It 's quite basic , but it does support syntax highlighting for around 30 languages and regular expression search and replace .
Editra
http://editra.org/
v 0.4.88 | Free
Editra claims to be in the early stages of development , but it offers a decent bunch of features : user profiles , auto - completion , session saving , and syntax highlighing for 60 + languages .
Plugins can extend the feature set , offering an integrated python console , FTP client , file browser , and calculator , among others .
PSPad
http://www.pspad.com/en/
v 4.5.3 | Free
PSPad brings templates , an interesting internal web browser , and a macro recorder to the table .
It also supports hex editing , and some degree of code compiling .
PSPad offers integration with TopStyle Lite , which may come in handy if you use it for writing CSS .
RJ TextEd
http://www.rj-texted.se/
v 5.10 | Free
RJ TextED , too , offers integration with TopStyle Lite ; and it does HTML validation and formatting .
It sports an FTP client , a file browser , and a code browser , as well as a character map and support for email .
SourceEdit
http://www.brixoft.net/prodinfo.asp?id=1
v 4 | Free
SourceEdit includes features such as clipboard history , syntax highlighting and autocompletion for a decent set of languages .
A hex editor and FTP client beef this one up a bit , too .
Oh , and it does macros , too .
TotalEdit
http://www.codertools.com/totaledit.aspx
v 5.2 | Free
TotalEdit does file comparison , RegEx search and replace , and has multiple options for file backup / versioning .
For cleanup , it offers ( X) HTML and XML customizable formatting , and a spell checker .
You can install TotalEdit on a USB drive , making it portable , if you want ; you can also easily send the current document as an email .
Emacs
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
v 22.3 | Free
" Beyond just being able to edit plain text files , Emacs includes special features to help you write in many different programming and markup language .
Emacs can compare two files and highlight their differences .
Emacs is a file manager .
Emacs can read news , mail , and RSS feeds .
You can even play tetris in Emacs .
You might see now why some people consider Emacs to be not merely a text editor but almost a complete operating system .
Some users find that they can do almost all of their work from within Emacs . "
Vim
http://www.vim.org/
v 7.2 | Free
Vim is an incredibly complex text editor , more similar to Emacs than any others on our list ( although Vim and Emacs users seem to be somewhat at odds ) .
I do n't think I could do it justice in a few sentences , considering that there have been whole volumes written on it ( not to mention that I have only a cursory knowledge of Vim ) .
Suffice it to say that Vim probably has every feature mentioned in this article , and a few hundred more .
For starters , check out " Vim in 6 K "
Bespin
http://bespin.mozilla.com
v 0.2.2 | Free
I know Bespin is n't really a Windows text editor , and it hardly has the feature set that other editors do , but I thought I 'd throw it into the mix just because I really like the concept of an online text editor and because it has one big ( obvious ) feature that the rest do n't : cloud access to your code .
It also offers syntax highlighting for HTML , CSS and JavaScript .
Textpad
TextPad is a rather simplistic editor : it boasts column select , drag - and - drop text between files , and hyperlink support .
It also supports large files ( based on the size of your virtual memory ) .
That 's it ?
Well , the feature list also mentions a right - click menu .
E - Text Editor
This is one of the most interesting editors , mainly because of the ' foreign ' features it brings to Windows :
" Close integration with cygwin [ a Linux - like environment for Windows ] gives you access to the full range of UNIX shell tools and lets you extend e with your choice of languages like Ruby , Perl , Python and more . "
Another one of e's strong points is that it accepts TextMate bundles ; it also supports revision control , so you do n't have to keep track of multiples versions of a file .
In - Type
http://intype.info
v 03.x ( alpha ) | currently free , to be ~ $ 25 – $ 45
Intype is a pretty neat little editor that 's still in development .
It currently does n't have a whole lot of features ( you ca n't even drag and drop text ) , but it looks like it will be pretty slick .
It does snippets really well , and already offers a pretty wide selection , as well as supporting about two dozen languages ( with support for creating additional ones ) .
Keep an eye on this one ; it 's promising .
EditPlus
EditPlus does n't have anything unique , but there are some niceties : it highlights URLs and email addresses , activating them when you ' crtl + double - click ' .
It also has a built in browser for previewing HTML , and FTP and SFTP support .
Macros and RegEx find and replace are good to have as well .
HippoEDIT
HippoEDIT offers something a bit different when it comes to autocomplete : in pops a ' tooltip ' above your cursor as you type , suggesting words you 've already typed .
It does syntax highlighting for over 2 dozen languages , and includes code templates for many of those languages .
HippoEDIT also has customizable keyboard shortcuts and workspace layouts .
UltraEdit
UltraEdit almost seems more like an IDE than a text editor ; there are hundreds ( easily thousands ) of features packed into this one .
Obviously reaching out to more than just web developers , UltraEdit is ultra-customizable , with different ' environments ' to choose from , depending on what job you 're doing .
Supposedly " nearly every editing task " is automatable .
UltraEdit also supports FTP and has a built - in SSH / telnet console for accessing your servers .
Sublime Text
Sublime
Text is probably one of the most fun editors that I looked at , mainly because of its super - cool ' zoomed out ' view of the file that you can pan around on .
One drawback is that the preferences dialog is really just a bunch of text files ; this can make it a bit difficult to tweak settings if you do n't know exactly what you 're looking for .
I like the option to open a local file when you right - click on its link , and there are a few automation features , so this would make a solid choice of a text editor .
Extras
While reseaching for this article , I found a few other related things .
First off , text editors are good for more than coding : they provide an excellent environment for writing content .
To that end , you might want to check out WriteMonkey , Q10 , or DarkRoom .
These editors are n't very good for coding , but are great for writing copy with minimal distractions .
Then , for some interesting tips on text editing , check out the video " Seven Habits for effective Text Editing 2.0 " by the creator of Vim .
That 's it !
I 'd love to hear what text editor you use , and why ; chances are , I missed a few good ones .

BMW Gina Light Visionary Model
Called the “ GINA Light Visionary ” , this innovative BMW concept is essentially a futuristic roadster that ’s covered in a flexible fabric material .
While it replaces the sheet metal , this fabric is expansion - resistant and highly durable , as well as allowing drivers to change the frame ’s shape via electro - hydraulic controls .
Rinspeed Glass
Designed by Rinspeed , it comes equipped with a turbocharged 750 cc 2 - cylinder engine that produces 150hp , with a top speed of 130 mph .
A lightweight aluminum frame and transparent Makrolon ( ultra durable plastic ) shell — giving it a faux “ glass ” look — contribute to the vehicle ’s 1653 - pound weight .
flaming
Although neo -con con artists and right - wing opportunists in this country are doing their best to pour fire on , to mix a couple of metaphors , the Iranian powder keg -- positively gleeful at the prospects of spilling innocent blood , of whomever , and of embarrassing President Obama for his cautious , diplomatic reaction -- even solid conservatives like George Will and Dick Lugar were repulsed yesterday when extremists in the GOP started howling for " regime change . "
Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) was especiallyinflammatory and sure to cause grief to the Iranian patriots struggling against a brutal and paranoid regime increasingly prepared to shoot down its own citizens .
Florida 's extreme right Senate candidate , Marco Rubio , looked at the troubles there as an opportunity to endear himself to the NRA and to suggest that Iranians ignore Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King and turn to violence ( something all hard right Republicans love ) , exactly the kind of excuse that could save the tottering fascist regime .
Yesterday as the rift within the ruling elite grew even wider , 5 members of ex-President Hashemi Rafsanjani 's family , including his 46 year old daughter Faezeh , were arrested and taken into custody ( and then released ) , a clear warning to the senior ayatollah and Chairman of the Assembly of Experts to not make a move against the Supreme Leader , which the Iranian Constitution empowers the Assembly of Experts to do .
The protests , which started out as a demand for new elections by middle class Iranians in North Tehran has started spreading to labor unions and has split the political and religious elites .
Yesterday Ali Larijani , the speaker of Iran ’s Parliament and no reformer , urged the Guardian Council to " thoroughly " investigate complaints about the election and said that " a majority of people are of the opinion that the actual election result is different from what was officially announced . "
At the same time he denounced interference in domestic Iranian politics by the U.S. , Britain , France and Germany .
The military appears firmly behind the Khamenei - Ahmadinejad clique .
The acting head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Gholam Ali Rashid , came down on Mousavi like a ton of bricks yesterday : " We are determined to confront plots by enemies aimed at creating a rift in the nation .
" This week , Magazine has a good analysis of the Iranian political system and a who 's who for beginners .
They make the point that " the conflict in Iran thus far has been not so much a wholesale revolt of the masses against the system , as it is a complex struggle for power within Iran 's ruling establishment , and a battle over the country 's direction . "
Here 's how they rate ' em:1- Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Supreme Leader for the last 2 decades .
" Lacking the charisma , religious rank and founding - father prestige of his predecessor , he sought to bolster his authority by supporting radical Islamic causes and appearing as the avuncular head of the Iranian family .
" 2- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a radical right populist -- their version of a teabagger -- who won the presidency in 2005 , " styling himself as a populist champion of the little guy against a corrupt establishment , and as a nationalist who flexes Iran 's muscle on the world stage ... close to the powerful , shadowy political factions and security organizations behind Iran 's Supreme Leader .
"
3 - Mir Hossein Mousavi , a former prime minister who has never shown much inclination towards reform until now .
He 's " promising greater democracy and sober economic management in Iran , and improved relations with the West .
Having mounted a remarkable challenge to Ahmadinejad 's re-election , his accusation of election fraud and denunciation of ' dictatorship ' represents an unprecedented challenge to the status quo by the forces of reform .
" 4- Mohammed Khatami , a two term president who won a landslide victory in 1997 as a reformer .
The Supreme Leader cracked down on his reforms big time and that is probably why he decided to steal the election for Ahmadinejad this time .
5- Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani , one of Iran 's richest men , former speaker of parliament and two - term president , current head of the Assembly of Experts , which -- at least theoretically -- could depose Khamenei .6 - Mehdi Karroubi , a former parliament speaker and the only real reformist in the presidential race .
7 - Grand Ayatollah Ali Montazeri , has greater religious authority than Khamenei .
He was one of the first in the elite to denounce the election results as fraudulent and he's a believer in separation of church and state .
8- Ali Larijani is the current parliament speaker , close to Khamenei but at odds with Ahmadinejad .
9 - Major General Mohammed Ali Jafari , head of the 300,000 strong Revolutionary Guard , " the most powerful element in the regime 's security forces , running everything from the country 's missile systems to the basij militia , whose hundreds of thousands of young men enforce domestic order and have been at the forefront off attacks against those protesting the election result .
Reporting to the Supreme Leader , the IRGC , is listed by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization -- and also maintains an extensive business empire in Iran .
10 - Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati , is the radical right extremist head of the Guardian Council and a close ally of Ahmadinejad .
He 's in charge of looking into election fraud ; he's to Iranian politics as Ann Coulter is to American politics -- except he wields power ( and never had a sex change operation ) .

In my last post , I wrote about the hijacking of JSON arrays .
Near the end of the post , I mentioned a comment whereby someone suggests that what really should happen is that browsers should be more strict about honoring content types and not execute code with the content type of application / json .
I totally agree !
But then again , browsers have n’t had a good track record with being strict with such standards and it ’s probably too much to expect browsers to suddenly start tightening ship , not to mention potentially breaking the web in the process .
Another potential solution that came to mind was this :
Can we simply change JSON ?
Is it too late to do that or has that boat left the harbor ?
Let me run an idea by you .
What if everyone got together and decided to version the JSON standard and change it in such a way that when the entire JSON response is an array , the format is no longer executable script .
Note that I ’m not referring to an array which is a property of a JSON object .
I ’m referring to the case when the entire JSON response is an array .
One way to do this , and I ’m just throwing this out there , is to make it such that the JSON package must always begin and end with a curly brace .
JSON objects already fulfill this requirement , so their format would remain unchanged .
But when the response is a JSON array , we would go from here :
[ {" Id " : 1 , " Amt " : 3.14} , {" Id " : 2 , " Amt " : 2.72} ]
to here :
{ [ {" Id " : 1 , " Amt " : 3.14} , {" Id " : 2 , " Amt " : 2.72} ] }
Client code would simply check to see if the JSON response starts with { [ to determine whether it ’s an array , or an object .
There many alternatives , such as simply wrapping ALL JSON responses in some new characters to keep it simple .
It ’d be possible to do this without breaking every site out there by simply giving all the client libraries a head start .
We would update the JavaScript libraries which parse JSON to recognize this new syntax , but still support the old syntax .
That way , they ’d work with servers which have n’t yet upgraded to the new syntax .
As far as I know , most sites that make use of JSON are using it for Ajax scenarios so the site developer is in control of the client and server anyways .
For sites that provide JSON as a cross - site service , upgrading the server before the clients are ready could be problematic , but not the end of the world .
So what do you think ?
Is this worth pursuing ?
Not that I have any idea on how I would convince or even who I would need to convince . ;)
UPDATE : 6/26 10:39 AM
Scott Koon points out this idea is not new ( I did n’t think it would be ) and points to a great post that gives more detail on the specifics of executable JSON as it relates to the ECMAScript Specification .
Dear neighbours ,
It looks as though you will be hearing quite a bit more about Canada in the next couple of years , so I thought we should have a word .
No , no , now , come on .
I 'm not going to bore you about our cultural festivals or our clean streets .
It 's our health - care system you 'll be hearing about .
And some of what you 'll hear wo n't be pleasant .
Now that President Barack Obama seems determined to plow ahead with that campaign promise to create affordable , universal health care , the uproar is already starting and my country 's system , understandably enough , seems to be the point of reference .
As you might know , we Canadians actually have universal health care .
It 's a big deal for us .
In fact , it 's probably the thing we cite most often when we try to explain what makes us different from you ( other than our apparent willingness to pay more for just about everything we buy ) .
Burton Cummings of the Guess Who : American woman , " sparkle someone else 's eyes . " ( CBC )
Look , I 'm going to be honest here : our system makes us feel superior .
I do n't know a Canadian who does n't work it into any conversation with an American that lasts more than two minutes .
Guess who
We call our system a " safety net . "
We think it helps prevent the sort of crushing social inequality that most of us think is everywhere on your side of the border .
We actually love hearing about your crushing social inequality .
It 's a favorite Canadian topic .
Remember that famous Canadian rock song , American Woman , by the Guess Who back in the ' 70s ?
Listen to the words sometime .
Anyway , while the progressives among you seem to envy our system , your conservatives hate it .
And they seem to think our system is where your president is headed .
They 're the ones you 'll be hearing most from .
Actually , you 're already hearing from them if you watch cable news .
A group called Conservatives for Patients ' Rights has already started running attack ads talking about the " victims of government - run health care . "
Most of these " victims , " it turns out , are Canadian .
Rationing
The ads seem a bit over the top .
But — and this is not going to help my popularity back home — there 's a fair amount of truth in them , too .
One features Dr. Brian Day , a private clinic owner and former head of the Canadian Medical Association , saying that what we Canadians really have is access to " a government / state - mandated wait list . "
According to Day , " the wait lists are long , the patients are languishing and suffering on wait lists . "
Another features a British Columbia businessman named Don Neufeldt , who grew tired of waiting for treatment for his heart arrhythmia and headed to Oklahoma to have it fixed .
After the doctors there sewed him up , they told him it had been a life - threatening condition .
In other words , he could have died on the Canadian wait list .
These ads are already provoking indignation in Canada , but really , they should n't .
The fact is , the provincial governments that run the health - care system up there practise rationing .
Effectively , they pay doctors to decide who deserves quick treatment and who does n't .
This is not radical ; Britain does it too , among others .
Promises
It is an approach that is incomprehensible to most Americans , I grant you .
But Dr. Day is right : depending on your age and condition , you can suffer for quite a while in Canada before the doctor gets to you , and it's all pretty much up to the governments , which control the spending taps .
( Of course , if you 're somebody important , or you know somebody important , the queue can be quite flexible .
Canadian VIPs , as a general rule , do n't spend much time waiting for health care ) .
Now , Canadian politicians are constantly promising to fix the situation and , during election campaigns , they stand in front of big backdrops promising shorter wait lines .
The queues , however , never seem to get much shorter .
As one medical - industry monitoring group put it in a report last year : " Commitments ( made five years ago ) have been only partially met at best . "
It 's your money
There is something else you 're going to be hearing about our system , too : we Canadians can't just reach into our pockets and pay for quick care .
Rick Baker is a Vancouver - based broker who arranges American treatment for impatient Canadians .
He appears in the new ads , saying " there is only one other country in the world , that 's North Korea , that follows our pattern . "
In Canada , he points out , " It is against the law for a medical provider to accept payment for rendering medical services . "
Again , pretty much accurate , except for the foolish North Korea comparison .
There is a principle behind the ban on patients paying : it 's based on the notion that you should n't be able to buy your way to the front of the line .
That 's a difficult one to explain to Americans .
Most of you are accustomed to spending your money as you see fit once the government is finished taxing you .
Canadians just do n't have that privilege .
Customer service
While I 'm at this , dear friends , I might as well tell you a few other things about our system .
You know how doctors here sometimes give you their home or cellphone numbers and ask you to call them directly if you have a problem ?
Or how they 'll call you in the evening to check up on you after a treatment ?
Or how many others on the hospital staff here are always trying to answer your questions , instead of telling you only the doctor is permitted to speak ?
It 's not like that where I come from .
Most of you would n't be happy at all with our customer service .
In the interest of balance , though , I must tell you about a few other things you wo n't have to deal with if President Obama gets Congress to adopt something like the Canadian system .
You wo n't have your health insurance cancelled on an insurer 's whim , which happens here all the time , or have it denied if you or some relative was once sick .
" Pre-existing conditions " do n't matter at all in Canada .
You wo n't have some bean - counting weasel in your health group or your insurance plan conspiring to deprive you of the treatment to which you are entitled .
You wo n't lose your health care if you lose your job .
You wo n't have ever - rising " co- pays " and deductibles and fees ; and you wo n't wind up hounded by a collection agent who calls at all hours to inform you that your credit could be wrecked for life if you continue to dispute a charge on your medical bill .
Also , if you spend some time in hospital , you wo n't end up with months of incomprehensible invoices from everyone who provided any service , from the guy who operated the EKG machine to the guy who read the test results to the woman who administered the anaesthetic to the lab that did the blood work .
The difference between our systems is pretty simple really .
If you have money or gold - plated coverage , you 're probably better off here the way things are now .
If you can't afford insurance or you 're a working stiff struggling to pay your premiums , you 're probably better off in Canada .
It 's hard to tell exactly what system exactly President Obama has in mind .
It 's probably going to involve a big fight .
But if you do n't mind me offering some advice : do n't believe everything you hear .
id Software to Release a New iPhone Game Every 2 - 3 Months
The latest in iPhone news ( and I know there ’s been a lot of it this month ) comes from id Software .
You may know them as the creators of games like Doom and Wolfenstein and the upcoming Rage .
i Phone users will be getting introduced to , or reacquainted with , id over the next year .
id co-founder John Carmack told Joystiq today that he is “ passionate about the benefits of the iPhone , ” and that his company has a lot of fun porting their titles .
He also says it does n’t require a lot of focus , at least for an established IP like Doom .
But there is more to come from Carmack and company , who recently announced their buyout by ZeniMax , parent company to Bethesda .
“ I ’ve got a slate of iPhone titles , I expect to have an iPhone release every two or three months for the next year , ” said Carmack .
He made it clear that the benefit is n’t necessarily the money , but rather the level of commitment .
When a game does n’t cost millions of dollars to make and market , it ’s a lot less pressure on the development team , which Carmack views as a good thing .
I ’m glad to see a major developer taking the iPhone into serious consideration .
Titles like Myst have recently been ported as well , but how about some new IP ?
Personally , I ’d love some .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
Even as the nation 's economy is showing some tentative signs of bottoming out , another calamity looms : the public pension bomb .
For years , states nationwide have shortchanged the retirement programs that cover teachers , police , and other public employees ; now the stock market plunge has wiped out billions of dollars from already underfunded plans .
California , New York and Illinois are among the states scrambling to plug multibillion - dollar holes in their pension systems .
The growing obligations raise the specter of higher taxes , diminished services , or even another round of costly federal bailouts .
" States have long needed to reduce their unfunded liabilities , and widespread investment losses have made it even more necessary to put money in , " says Lance Weiss , author of a 2006 Deloitte study of state pensions .
" But the market crash also means there 's less money available to use for contributions .
Everything is coming together to create a crisis . "
To better understand this ticking time bomb it helps to focus on a single state , and New Jersey makes a compelling case study .
For one thing , its situation is dire .
In June 2008 the state estimated that the plan - one of the nation 's largest , covering teachers , state employees , firefighters , and police - had $ 34 billion less than it needed to meet its obligations .
Since then the market value of the plan has dropped from $ 82 billion to $ 56 billion ( a new estimate of underfunding is due in July ) .
Also , New Jersey is in some ways ahead of the pack in trying to deal with the crisis - Gov. Jon Corzine , a Democrat , made addressing the problem a central theme of his 2005 campaign - and the obstacles it is encountering shed light on the hard choices facing other states .
" The pension obligations could spark a huge problem for New Jersey , " says Thomas Kean , a former Republican governor .
" They must be paid because they are absolutely an obligation of the state , but as it is , the budget is balanced with chewing gum and sealing wax . "
***
To figure out how such a wealthy state ( with a median household income of $ 65,933 , New Jersey ranks No. 1 ) dug itself into this hole , set the clock back almost 20 years .
In 1990 the country was hit by a recession , and the new Democratic governor , James Florio , responded with a wildly unpopular $ 2.8 billion income and sales tax increase to balance the budget .
Two years later , facing another budget shortfall , he turned to the state pension system for help .
With almost unanimous support in the legislature , he pushed through the Pension Revaluation Act of 1992 .
We 'll spare you the minutiae of pension accounting and just say that the law permitted the state to recognize investment gains in the fund more quickly than under previous rules .
It also lifted the projected rate of return on the fund 's investments to 8.75 % from 7 % ( since lowered to 8.25 % ) .
These " adjustments " had a big impact : According to an official Benefits Review Task Force report published in 2005 , they allowed the state to cut its pension contributions by more than $ 1.5 billion in 1992 and 1993 .
Republican Christine Todd Whitman , running on a tax - cutting platform , defeated Florio in the 1993 governor 's race .
To help pay for her promised tax cuts , Whitman , like her predecessor , turned to the pension fund .
In 1994 , at her urging , the legislature adopted another pension " reform " act that allowed her to reduce state and local contributions to the plan by nearly $ 1.5 billion in 1994 and 1995 , according to the task force report .
Florio's and Whitman 's accounting changes were " the one - two punch from which the retirement system has never recovered , " says Douglas Forrester , who was the assistant state treasurer under Kean .
***
Seeking to make up lost ground without putting up more money , the state 's leaders looked to the magic of the stock market .
In 1997 New Jersey sold $ 2.75 billion of bonds paying 7.6 % interest , putting the proceeds into the pension fund to be invested for higher returns .
At that time Whitman said the ironically named Pension Security Plan would save taxpayers about $ 45 billion .
It has n't worked out that way .
The fund has earned less than 6 % annually since the bonds were issued .
" This is classically referred to as arbitrage , " says U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance , a Republican who served in the New Jersey legislature from 1991 through 2008 .
" It 's a questionable strategy in the private sector , and it 's certainly not acceptable as a matter of public policy . "
That was n't the state 's last venture into high finance .
The system , along with almost every other investor , suffered sharp losses after the dotcom bust of 2001 .
Democrat James McGreevey , who became governor in 2002 , hoped that professional money managers would improve the plan 's returns .
At the time New Jersey was the only state other than Texas to run its pension fund without outside help .
McGreevey appointed Orin Kramer , a money manager who had been finance chair of his unsuccessful 1997 gubernatorial campaign , as head of the State Investment Council , which sets policy for the pension plan .
Kramer pushed the council to turn over some of the fund 's assets to Wall Street professionals and to diversify into alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity .
But it took time for Kramer to devise a strategy and put it into action , so money did n't flow to alternative investments until 2006 , on the eve of the bear market that would crush nearly all asset categories .
" Our asset - allocation model was based on the idea that there was no correlation between our alternatives and bonds and equities , " says James Marketti , retired president of Communications Workers of America Local 1032 , who has been a member of the state 's investment council since September 2008 .
" It turns out they were perfectly correlated . "
For all the miscues , New Jersey 's pension woes can't be blamed on particularly poor investment results .
An examination of state reports shows that the fund 's returns have more or less tracked the broad stock market's .
The real problem has been the underfunding .
Meanwhile , the obligations keep mounting :
Even while they were neglecting pension contributions , New Jersey politicians were sweetening the pot .
In 2001 benefits for the state 's two largest groups of workers , government employees and teachers , were increased by 9 % , creating an additional $ 4.2 billion in liabilities .
In 1999 the state approved a " 20 and out " measure that allowed firefighters and local police to collect pensions equal to 50 % of their pay after 20 years of service - a perk previously available only to the state police .
Benefits added since 1999 have increased liabilities by more than $ 6.8 billion , according to official estimates .
Today New Jersey seems locked in a downward spiral .
" New Jersey and many other systems have negative cash flows , meaning that contributions are less than the benefits we pay out , " says William Clark , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which manages the pension fund .
" You can't make your money back when it 's flowing out of the system . "
***
Gov. Corzine 's efforts to prop up the plan have had mixed results .
After taking office he boosted contributions , injecting about $ 1 billion in 2007 and a similar amount in 2008 .
He planned to add another $ 1 billion in 2009 , but in response to budget pressures now wants to spread that money over two years .
And the legislature just passed a " pension holiday " bill that allows municipalities to skip their pension contributions for 2009 .
Corzine has also imposed reduced benefits on state workers .
Since 2007 he has raised the retirement age to 62 , increased the salary requirement for pension eligibility , increased employee contributions , and capped pension income .
But unions are fighting his request that members take unpaid furloughs and give up some or all of the wage hikes they are due .
" We believe reopening contracts should be a last resort as we seek to find other ways to free up money , " says Anthony Miskowski , secretary of CWA Local 1033 .
" If we budge on the contracts , the unions are dead . "
But after a pause , he acknowledges that something has to give : " We 'll be forced someday to be more flexible . "
And those are baby steps compared with the sweeping measures recommended by consultants like Deloitte for all states facing pension crises .
They include reducing benefits for current and future employees , pegging cost - of - living increases to actual inflation , cutting early - retirement programs , and forcing the states to stick with adequate funding plans .
That 's more of a wish list than a practical plan of action .
" These are all politically sensitive solutions , " says Deloitte 's Weiss .
" The unions are screaming , but states have to stop the bleeding . "
If New Jersey reaches the point where one or more of the funds in its system runs out of money , the state will have to pay retirees out of annual revenue , adding another burden to the budget .
That 's how the state covers retiree health - care costs , expected to hit $ 1.1 billion this year .
( An attempt to pre-fund those expenses began in the 1980s but was sacrificed to budget pressures in 1994 . )
It would then have to slash services or boost taxes to balance the budget , a pair of ugly options .
The Tax Foundation says New Jersey charges the highest state and local taxes in the country , the highest residential and commercial property taxes , and some of the highest sin taxes in the nation on cigarettes and alcohol .
If union concessions , cost cutting , and higher taxes are not enough , then what ?
Inevitably , New Jersey and other states would turn to Uncle Sam for help .
The pressure on Congress would be great .
" How will they say no to state workers when they 've said yes to bankers ? " asks Marketti .
Even so , Congress might balk at opening the door to a series of multibillion - dollar state bailouts .
In that case , we might well see a wave of municipal or even state bankruptcies as pension obligations overwhelm local budgets .
To Leonard Lance , the pension blowup is one more consequence of the financial recklessness that defined an era .
" In so many areas there has been inappropriate spending , " he says .
" Now we all have to pay . "

Lawyers who have argued cases before Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor call her “ nasty , ” “ angry ” and a “ terror on the bench , ” according to the current Almanac of the Federal Judiciary — a kind of Zagat ’s guide to federal judges .
The withering evaluation of Judge Sotomayor ’s temperament stands in stark contrast to reviews of her peers on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Of the 21 judges evaluated , the same lawyers gave 18 positive to glowing reviews and two judges received mixed reviews .
Judge Sotomayor was the only one to receive decidedly negative comments .
Judge Sotomayor ’s demeanor on the bench will be one of the issues the Senate Judiciary Committee tackles when she appears for her confirmation hearing .
A lack of a good temperament has been used as a line of attack against nominees in the past - most notably conservative Judge Robert H. Bork , whose nomination to the Supreme Court was defeated .
But several lawyers and legal scholars on a call organized by the White House said the criticism is misplaced and that Judge Sotomayor ’s legal acumen is overwhelming .
“ She does not suffer fools gladly , ” said Kevin Russell , a partner for Howe & Russell P.C. who argued a case before Judge Sotomayor about respiratory ailments suffered by the men and women who cleaned up ground zero after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
“ I guess it is predictable that some of those fools would then complain about it . ”

Much of the public vetting of Judge Sotomayor , whom President Obama nominated to be the first Hispanic woman to sit on the nation ’s highest court , has focused on her range of rulings on hot - button social issues .
Although the same lawyers who chastised her temperament gave her high marks on her legal abilities , Judge Sotomayor was the only member of the 2nd Circuit to receive a universally negative review of her temperament .
“ She really lacks judicial temperament .
She behaves in an out - of - control manner .
She makes inappropriate outbursts , ” one lawyer told the almanac .
Another said she “ abuses lawyers . ”
The authors of the almanac interviewed at least eight lawyers who practice regularly before the judges and granted them anonymity so that they could provide candid assessments , said Megan Rosen , the editor of the almanac .
The guide profiles every federal judge .
Ms. Rosen said that although Judge Sotomayor ’s evaluations in the area of temperament were harsh , lawyers clearly respect her abilities - something not true of every judge reviewed in the almanac .
“ Generally , when lawyers have respect for a judge it shows in all their other categories , ” Ms. Rosen said .
“ If you know it ’s just the general demeanor of the judge , it can help ease some of the tension that would otherwise be there . ”
The lawyer reviews cover the rulings , political leanings and legal abilities of the jurists .
The almanac , published in November , said Judge Sotomayor writes good opinions , is liberal but careful to follow precedent and has good legal abilities .
“ She is a direct and candid questioner , ” said Thomas H. Dupree Jr. , a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general who has argued five cases before Judge Sotomayor since 2007 .
People often mistake her intensity for aggression and anger , Judge Sotomayor told the Associated Press in 1998 .
During a high - profile national security case heard by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in December , Judge Sotomayor gave the attorney for a Canadian man who had been detained by U.S. forces little room to work .
Judge Sotomayor interrupted the lawyer , David Cole , numerous times about whether there was standing for a U.S. court to hear the case , before eventually explaining her aggressive questioning .
“ That ’s why I ’m trying to figure out and untie your arguments a bit , ” Judge Sotomayor told Mr. Cole .
Legal scholar Jeffrey Rosen documented concerns from 2nd Circuit law clerks and New York prosecutors in a piece he wrote for the New Republic earlier this month .
In the piece , he quoted anonymous members of the New York legal community who described Judge Sotomayor as an intellectual lightweight and “ kind of a bully on the bench . ”
On the White House - organized call , Judge Sotomayor ’s colleagues praised her careful reading of laws and characterized her as a judge bent on restraint and narrow readings of statutes .
Lawyers on the call couched her aggressive questioning as a product of a “ hot bench ” and poring over details meticulously .

• Obama names first Hispanic to high court
• Sotomayor battled bias in D.C .
• Sotomayor would be court ’s 6th Catholic
• Sotomayor deflected Republicans before
• Sotomayor reversed 60 % by high court
Judge Sotomayor ’s judicial temperament was raised during her 1997 confirmation hearing to the appeals court .
Sen .
Jeff Sessions , the Alabama Republican who recently became the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , told Judge Sotomayor that she was out of bounds when she criticized mandatory minimum sentences from the bench during one sentencing proceeding .
“ I do think that a judge , would you not agree , has to be careful in conducting themselves in a way that reflects respect for the law and the system , ” Mr. Sessions said .
Judge Sotomayor said she probably should not have used the word “ abomination ” to describe the guidelines , but that her record showed she did n’t let her personal opinions affect her rulings .
“ I do what the law requires , and I think that is the greatest respect I could show for it , ” she told Mr. Sessions .
Harvard law professor and Obama mentor Charles Ogletree said lawyers caught off guard by Judge Sotomayor ’s demeanor who criticize her are “ misconstruing her sense as a well - prepared judge , one who is not on a fishing expedition . ”
Conservative activists have decided on attacking Judge Sotomayor as a judicial activist who would work outside the rule of law .
The Judicial Confirmation Network , which is leading a coalition of conservative groups , is airing an ad featuring Judge Sotomayor talking about whether judges set policy from the bench .

Enlarge By Ibrahim Usta , AP A woman cries and others mourn in the village of Bilge , Turkey , on Tuesday , one day after gunmen attacked an engagement celebration , leaving 44 people dead .
BILGE , Turkey ( AP ) 
Eight men suspected of gunning down 44 people during an engagement ceremony were arrested Tuesday , accused of killing the betrothed couple — whose wedding they opposed — along with relatives and friends in a 15 - minute rampage .
Two girls survived by concealing themselves beneath the bodies of their slain friends during the shootings in Turkey 's impoverished rural southeast , where tribal ties and rivalries can eclipse the power of the state .
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the attack was " the result of a feud between two families . "
Security forces backed by armored vehicles set up checkpoints on roads leading to Bilge , the village where the killings took place late Monday .
Authorities also cut telephone communication with the hamlet .
Anatolia news agency said the masked attackers had wanted the young woman , Sevgi Celebi , to marry one among their own group of friends or relatives but that her family would not allow it .
It cited unnamed villagers as saying there was a dispute between the attackers ' family and the family of the would - be groom , and that Celebi 's family had resisted pressure to cancel the marriage plans .
" No customs and mores can be used as an excuse for this massacre , " Erdogan said .
" This is the painful price we are paying for such customs and mores . "
Among the dead , he said , were six children , 17 women and 21 men .
He said some suspects had the same family name as the victims .
" The people were killed at a happy event , during a ceremony , while praying , " Erdogan said in his weekly address to ruling party lawmakers in parliament .
" The fact that they pointed guns and massacred children , defenseless people , is atrocious . "
Reports said the gunmen opened fire as men and women prayed in separate rooms in line with tradition in parts of Turkey .
One teenage girl said she lost six members of her family .
" I heard the shooting and I hid in the barn because I was afraid .
I was really afraid , " the girl said on television footage released by Turkey 's Dogan news agency .
On Tuesday morning , four large earth - movers dug graves for victims in the village cemetery .
Residents carried gravestones and two dozen seated women wept beside a tree , slapping their legs in grief .
Men silently watched from a hilltop nearby as soldiers patrolled .
Interior Minister Besir Atalay said eight suspects were in custody .
" They were caught with their weapons , " he said .
Abdullah Akan was one of the first villagers who entered the house where the shooting occurred during praying .
" There were bodies everywhere when I entered the house .
The imam in the front and the men lined up behind him , all were dead , " daily Hurriyet 's website quoted Akan as saying .
" Women and children were in a separate room , the inside was a bloodbath .
I have not seen such savagery in my life . "
Opposition lawmaker Canan Aritman urged the government to take steps toward eradicating the tribal system , though she did not elaborate .
" It is something that does n't exist even in the most primitive societies , " said Aritman , member of a parliamentary panel investigating so - called " honor killings " within traditional families .
Mehmet Besir Ayanoglu , the mayor of Mardin , told Channel 24 that he spoke to two survivors , both girls , who said at least two masked men stormed a house where the ceremony took place .
Bedia Akbulut , a teacher living in the village , told Anatolia her husband turned out the lights when they first heard shots fired .
" Then there was silence and we went out .
Everyone in the village was in great fear , " she said .
" We ca n't believe what we went through . "

That evidence , however , may not see the legal light of day because of legal and diplomatic roadblocks in the long - running effort by the families to sue the Saudi government and its leaders in the attacks on New York and Washington , The New York Times reported Wednesday .

The new documents -- including interviews with intermediaries and reviews of money trails -- provided to the Times are among the hundreds of thousand of pages of investigative material the families and insurers have unearthed as part of a civil lawsuit seeking to hold Saudi Arabia and its royal family liable for financing al - Qaida .
Saudi lawyers countered that the ties are weak , saying Saudi Arabia is being sued because of its vast wealth and because it was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers .
" In looking at all the evidence the families brought together , I have not seen one iota of evidence that Saudi Arabia had anything to do with the Sept. 11 ( 2001 ) attacks , " Michael Kellogg , a Washington lawyer representing Prince Muhammad al - Faisal al - Saud in the lawsuit , told the Times .
Two federal judges and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the 7,630 plaintiffs -- survivors and family members of those killed in the attacks -- by throwing out the suit on the ground the families cannot bring legal action in the United States against a sovereign nation and its leaders .
The Supreme Court is expected to decide this week whether to hear an appeal .
It is nice to be home !

Okay see you tomorrow .
Ancient remains were found when work began on new roads
The results of a significant archaeological dig have been unveiled in County Down .
Neolithic and Bronze Age remains were found at Loughbrickland when work began on new roads four years ago .
They included evidence of three Neolithic houses dating back over 6,000 year and a Bronze Age burial site .
Information boards have now been erected at the site .
It is not yet known where the artefacts will be stored on a permanent basis .
Speaking about the finds , Education Minister Catriona Ruane , on behalf of Regional Development Minister Conor Murphy , said : " The display of these information boards marks the completion of the archaeological works associated with the A1 Loughbrickland to Beech Hill dual carriageway scheme .
" The Department of Regional Development is committed to fully record and research the archaeological sites that turn up from time to time in our road construction sites .
" The archaeological find near Loughbrickland has been acknowledged as rare and extremely significant , and it is good that the people of this area can access the information now displayed here and learn more about the history of the area . "
For many years now , and especially since 2003 , the media have been bombarding us with news , images and reports from Iraq which paint a very negative picture .
To me , as someone born and raised in Baghdad and with deep roots in the country , the Iraq that I know has never been visible in this coverage .
I miss people talking about the history of an ancient civilisation and the rich contemporary culture - the way of life I was lucky enough to have experienced in my time living there - so I was very happy to have the opportunity to write the first Iraqi cookbook to be published in the UK .
Iraqi dishes are delicious , healthy and easy to cook .
Most of the more unusual or exotic ingredients are either now available in the UK , or can be successfully substituted .
Although the book started as a collection of recipes for my children and our guests at various dinner parties , it quickly turned into my way of sharing the Iraq that I know and love with the the world .
As is well known , modern Iraq arose from ancient Mesopotamian civilisation .
Many empires have passed through over the centuries and left their mark on the cuisine , creating links between Iraqi history , culture and food .
I have included personal memories of national dishes that have relevance to cultural celebrations - annual , seasonal , and familial .
Again , this was initially for the benefit of my children , who were never able to experience any of this first - hand .
Recipes for four dishes are here for you to try :
1. Kubbat Mousel is one of the most famous and authentic Iraqi dishes .
It was created in the city of Mousel ( 240 km north of Baghdad ) .
The size is a matter of great pride to the Mouselites and a way of showing guests a warm welcome .
2. Fasangoon is most probably Iranian in origin and became part of Iraqi cuisine through Iranian visitors to the shrines in the cities of Najaf and Karbala ( 150 km south of Baghdad ) and the close relations and marriages that resulted .
3. Sheikh Mahshi is one of the most loved stew dishes in Iraq and usually served with white rice fortified with roasted almonds and raisins .
Great as a starter or a full meal , it can be easily transformed into a vegetarian dish by replacing the minced meat with a vegetarian version or leaving it out all together .
4. Timman Jazar is one of my favourite dishes , delicious , aromatic and very easy to make .
The vegetarian alternative is as delicious if not more so - omit the minced meat ( add a cube of vegetarian stock , if you so wish ) or replace it with vegetarian mince .
If you do n't live near shops that stock some of the ingredients listed and need some suggestions for alternatives , or you 'd like to substitute the meat in these or any other Iraqi recipes , leave a question in the comments box and I 'll do my best to suggest something .
Has anyone already tried Iraqi cooking at home ?
Or do you have some bright new ideas for turning dishes involving mince into vegetarian delights ?
" The system of banking [ is ] a blot left in all our Constitutions ,
which , if not covered , will end in their destruction ...
I sincerely believe that banking institutions are more dangerous
than standing armies ; and that the principle of spending money to
be paid by posterity ... is but swindling futurity on a large scale . "
I saw a commercial for a new television program that will air on ABC TV ( USA ) called " The Goode Family " created by Mike Judge of King of the Hill and Beavis and Butt - head fame .
One of the characters wears a t - shirt with the phrase " Meat Is Murder " written across the front .
It begins later in May , so do n't know if there is any other Morrissey connection other than the T - shirt .
Decked out in campaign posters , Berlin is a city in the midst of poll fever .
Full - page advertisements have been bought in the city 's newspapers , street protests are being held , and sport and television personalities are being drawn into emotional public debates .
But this is no election campaign : at stake is the soul of this devoutly secular city .
Only 36 % of people profess to having a religious allegiance in Berlin , often described as the " atheist capital of Europe " .
So a referendum today on whether religious education should have the same status in the classroom as ethics teaching has provoked a bitter stand - off .
Christian Democrats and the churches have railed against the left , believers against atheists , west Berliners against east Berliners , and the middle classes against the proletariat .
Unlike in other German states , secular ethics has been a compulsory topic in the city - state of Berlin since 2006 , after the " honour killing " of a Turkish woman murdered by her brother because of her western lifestyle .
But religion remains only an optional course .
That has been so since the end of the war , when it was decided that religious teaching should be available in all schools as an answer to the " godless " Nazi crimes .
But participation was voluntary , lest authorities were accused of thrusting ideologies on pupils .
The " Pro Reli " campaigners , led by figures from the CDU of the chancellor , Angela Merkel , and church leaders , want to change the regulations so that pupils can choose between ethics and a religion class , with Muslims , Catholics and Protestants being taught separately .
" Pupils now have the choice between religion and free time - basically between religion and the ice - cream salon , " said Berlin 's leading Protestant bishop , Wolfgang Huber .
" It is not really fair to say that pupils have a choice ... Religion needs a proper place in the school timetable . "
The " Pro Ethik " campaign is being spearheaded by the Social Democrats and the Left party , who make up Berlin 's city government .
They argue that ethics teaching is central to ensuring integration in Berlin , which is now home to Germany 's biggest Muslim community .
" What 's so awful about an ethics lesson in which everyone takes part ? " asked Michael Müller , regional head of the Social Democrats .
" Is n't it a good thing that I learn something about my neighbour 's religion , his family and cultural background ? "
The country 's most famous television presenter , Günther Jauch , a prominent Catholic , has put his name to the Pro Reli campaign , next to the slogan : " In Berlin , we 're talking about freedom .
Do n't say you did n't have the chance to choose . "
Jauch , who is most famous for hosting the German version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? , said : " Religious education in Berlin is systematically pushed to the edge of the curriculum and discriminated against on the school agenda .
Whoever votes ' yes ' [ in favour of religious lessons ] on Sunday , will be voting for the free choice between ethics and religion . "
Berlin 's mayor , Klaus Wowereit , lashed out at Jauch 's involvement in the campaign .
In a newspaper interview , he said : " I think it 's scandalous that intelligent people like my friend Jauch can talk here about freedom .
He does n't know the meaning of the word . "
The Pro Reli camp has repeatedly accused the Pro Ethik camp of trying to impose an agenda on school pupils similar to the atheist East German school curriculum ; the Pro Ethik camp has in turn blamed the " Pro Relis " for launching a crusade against non-Christians .
Pupils are also divided , although according to polls the younger ones in particular are more in favour of religion .
More than 600,000 votes - a quarter of Berlin 's electorate - are needed for the referendum to be considered valid .
" I do n't know why they just can't combine the two topics , then no one could say there was anything unfair about it , " said Benedicta , a 15 - year - old pupil at a nondenominational school in Friedrichshain , in east Berlin .
Inspired by some recent art showing classic video games re-imagined to be more , well , classy , the Something Awful Forum Goons set out to try something similar .
The end result is n't necessarily hilarious , but represents a great collection of stylish , clever , and thoroughly creative images .
They made so many , in fact , that I had to break this into two features .

You can always count on the Daily Show .
As John presaged earlier this month , correspondent John Oliver visited CERN to do a report on the LHC , which has finally appeared .
Watch as John Ellis lays the science smackdown !
The best thing about it is that , once again , Jon Stewart and company have taken an issue that completely flummoxed most major news media -- in this case , the purported danger that the LHC will destroy the world -- and actually get it right .
In addition to visiting CERN itself , Oliver scored an interview with Walter Wagner ( " graduated UC Berkeley with a Minor in Physics " ) , originator of much of the hysteria and lawsuits .
You 'll get to hear Wagner explain that the probability the LHC will destroy the world is -- wait for it -- fifty percent .
You know , because when you have two things that can possibly happen , obviously each has half the probability , right ?
I do n't want to say too much about Walter Wagner , because , if nothing else , the guy is really fond of a good lawsuit .
So I have no comment whatsoever on Walter Wagner 's competence or sanity .
But I do know people who are utterly incompetent and completely insane , who resemble Walter Wagner in certain ways .
I 'll stop there .
See , major news media ?
It 's not that hard !

Michael Calderone has a column at Politico that suggests a new tactical approach by Republicans to get their message out .
He asserts , that the GOP is exploiting the broad reach of the Huffington Post to expand their media presence .
It ’s not a particularly bad idea as HuffPo is cracking 8.8 million unique visitors a month .
But it is a cynical effort to advance propaganda and , to the extent that HuffPo is an accessory to it , it is shameful and counterproductive .
The insidious element to this plot is that the GOP is n’t trying to reach out to new voters or gain access to people that might not otherwise be exposed to their views .
They are taking advantage of the popular web site to use as a platform from which to launch their viewpoints into more mainstream media in much the same way that conservatives have used the Drudge Report .
In his column , Calderone interviewed a collection of Republican press reps who confess to this strategy .
John Hart , press secretary to Sen .
Tom Coburn : [ I ] t ’s one of a handful of sites that can have an instant impact on the national debate .
Brian Rogers , spokesman for Sen. John McCain : HuffPo and [ Talking Points Memo ] really are the assignment editors for many in the Washington press corps – particularly the cables .
Brad Dayspring , press secretary for Rep. Eric Cantor :
The reality is that at the end of the day , like them or dislike them , sites like The Huffington Post , Plum Line , Salon , and others can drive news .
Michael Steel , press secretary for House Republican leader John Boehner : Republican aides [ are ] being sure to engage with liberal websites like Huffington Post – just because for no other reason than they drive a lot of cable coverage .
Alex Conant , former RNC national press secretary :
When I was at the RNC , it was n’t something that could be ignored .
To the contrary , I thought the more we could work with them – recognizing they had a bias – the better off we were .
Republicans are well aware that much of the audience at HuffPo is not sympathetic to their cause .
But that ’s irrelevant .
Part of the strategy is to drive a wedge between the Democratic establishment and its activist base .
Another part is just to garner more publicity :
“ Huffington Post reporter Ryan Grim , a former POLITICO staffer , said that after the House leadership released a video earlier this month questioning the White House on national security , a senior House Republican aide reached out to make sure he ’d received it – that ’s despite knowing how the site would probably play the story ( and how commenters would react ) .
The piece that resulted – “ House GOP Obama Ad Aims to Terrify ” – likely appealed to liberal Huffington Post readers , while also drawing attention to the Republican clip , which is what the party wanted all along . “
~~~
Liz Mair , former RNC online communications director :
While I certainly never expected left - of - center sites to echo our message , giving them access to information or background they needed to report accurately ( if not favorably ) was certainly something I thought of ( and think of ) as useful , given that their audience is not solely comprised of Democratic activists , and given that storylines that begin on left - of - center blogs frequently find their way onto the nightly news and into other outlets where a lot of swing voters get their information .
HuffPo , for it ’s part is not the least bit concerned about how they are being used .
Arianna Huffington told Politico that the attention the site gets from Republicans …
“ …is a reflection of our traffic , our brand , and the fact that we are increasingly seen … as an Internet newspaper , not positioned ideologically in terms of how we cover the news . ”
HuffPo is , of course , a business , and it has every right to pursue a mission that furthers it ’s financial interests .
However , if their stock in trade is their audience , then there is something untoward about exploiting them to benefit an ideological opponent .
In other words , HuffPo should not be permitted to sell us out to right - wing flacks who just want to do us harm .
If it is our patronage that makes HuffPo such a valuable asset , perhaps we ought not to be so patronizing .
There is nothing wrong with providing a forum that presents diverse opinions and perspectives .
But there is a limit reached when you are seen by one side as simply an avenue to advance their public profile , further their media strategy , and beat you , and your audience , over the head with your own bat .
You know you ’ve reached that limit when Grover Norquist says of you …
“ There are fewer better places to refute the opening bid by the [ Democrats ] than to plant your flag in the middle of The Huffington Post . ”
HuffPo would be wise to consider that , if it is their readers that make them an appealing political community , they may want to avoid alienating those readers by serving the interests of their opponents .
How many HuffPo readers would continue to visit the site were it to turn into a fancier version of the Drudge Report ?
And once readership scales back , how many Republicans would still view it as a useful platform ?
Continuing down this path would be a downward spiral for HuffPo .
They should take note of this and correct course as soon as possible .
The market has no need for an Internet news / community that caters to the far right .
They already have Fox Nation .

The first law of Chinese cyberpolitics is “ Where there are River Crabs , there are Grass - Mud Horses ( 那里有河蟹，那里就有草泥马 ) . ”
According to this “ Law of the Grass - Mud Horse , ” online censorship will always meet resistance .
The latest hot item circulating in the Chinese blogosphere is a compressed folder leaked from a Baidu employee .
It contains a set of working documents from Baidu ’s internal monitoring and censorship department , with details including staff names , their performance records , company contact lists , censorship guidelines , operating instructions , and specific lists of topics and words to be censored and blocked , guidelines of how to search information which needs to be banned , the backend URL , and other internal company information from November 2008 through March 2009 .
Baidu , China ’s leading search engine company , has a long history of being the most proactive and restrictive online censor in the search arena .
These newly available materials reveal and confirm how censors at the search engines distort and manipulate the search experiences of Chinese netizens .
These complete documents are being rapidly spread , and quickly deleted , in Chinese cyberspace .
CDT selectively posts some of those working documents here , including the list of filtered keywords ( in Chinese ) .

Photos Pontiac 's road to oblivion View photos
The Pontiac most of us know today really started in the early 1960s .
Over the years , there have been several attempts to bring it back .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices settled above $ 70 a barrel Tuesday for the first time in seven months , as the dollar fell and expectations grew that the economy is headed for recovery .
Light sweet crude for July delivery rose $ 1.92 , or more than 2.8 % , to settle at $ 70.01 a barrel Tuesday , having risen as high as $ 70.18 earlier in the session .
It was the first time crude settled above $ 70 since Nov. 4 , when it closed at $ 70.53 .
Since the end of 2008 , oil has doubled in price .
Oil is traded in dollars around the globe , and so a weaker dollar pushes the price of oil up .
The government 's deficit spending campaign has chipped away at the value of the dollar , affecting oil prices .
" Oil has been driven by the credit crisis .
Oil has been driven by the dollar , " said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Alaron Trading , in a daily research note .
On Tuesday , the dollar continued to weaken against most major currencies .
In addition to the dollar , prices have been following the stock market higher , as investors bet that as the economy recovers , so will demand for oil .
The Dow Jones industrial average has risen in 11 of the last 13 weeks , and has jumped more than 32 % from lows hit in early March .
On Tuesday , Wall Street pushed higher , as investors digested news that 10 major banks would be able to repay their government loans .
Another boost to oil prices was a commodities research report released Monday from Soci�t� G�n�rale that raised its price forecasts because of possible improvement in the global economy .
The financial services company raised its third - quarter price forecast by $ 8.50 to $ 65 a barrel , and its fourth - quarter estimate by $ 11.50 to $ 72.50 .
" Optimism regarding a global economic recovery has grown , driven by increasing data flow suggesting that the global contraction is decelerating , " wrote Michael Wittner , senior oil analyst at Soci�t� G�n�rale , in the report .
The global slowdown left a near glut of oil inventories , as businesses and consumers cut back .
The Energy Information Administration is due to release its supply data Wednesday .
According to a survey from Platts , a global energy information provider , analysts expect a 800,000 barrel increase in crude inventories last week , on the heels of a 2.9 million barrel build in the week ended May 29 .

The price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline increased to $ 2.622 a gallon Tuesday , up from $ 2.619 the day prior , according to a daily survey conducted by motorist group AAA .
Tuesday 's rise marked the 42nd consecutive daily increase .
The price rose 57 cents , or 28 % , in the 42 days it advanced , but remains $ 1.492 , or 36.3 % , lower than the record high of $ 4.114 that AAA reported on July 17 , 2008 .
A music teacher who punched a police officer in the face at a demonstration has been cleared of assault charges after a court ruled he was acting in self - defence .
Chris Bluemel said today his acquittal " speaks volumes " about the excessive force used by police at protests , after three magistrates decided he had been acting reasonably when he hit a police officer .
Bluemel , 28 , from Southampton , had been attending a protest at an arms factory in Brighton on 4 June last year when police struck him with batons amid a concerted effort to clear the last remaining protesters from a car park .
The protester punched a male officer , PC Dugan , who later complained his tooth had been loosened .
Dugan admitted at Brighton magistrates court that he used his baton on several protesters , although it was not clear whether he struck Bluemel .
For his part , Bluemel told how , in spite of complying with officers ' instructions to leave the area by telling them " I am going to leave now " , he was pushed and beaten repeatedly with batons on his back and left arm .
The court was shown photographs of Bluemel 's torso covered in bruises , taken days later at a naked bicycle ride .
Bluemel said that after being knocked to the floor , he jumped up and hit one of the officers in the face .
He said he was angry that well - armed officers were striking out without warrant , and he wanted to deter further attack .
The magistrates also took into account his Asperger 's syndrome .
On Friday the magistrates ruled police had used excessive and therefore unlawful force as they tried to remove protesters from the car park , and cleared Bluemel of assault of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty .
Bluemel was also cleared of the alternative charge of common assault .
Bluemel said he was relieved to be cleared as he feared he would lose his job teaching music at a sixth - form college .
" The fantastic thing is that we now know from the court that police used excessive force , " he said .
" It also speaks volumes that they ruled I was acting reasonably in the circumstances . "
Sussex police said : " We put together a thorough investigation , which was put before the court , and we respect the court 's decision . "
Pictured :
The spectacular eruption of an underwater volcano in the South Pacific
Spewing clouds of smoke , ash and steam thousands of feet into the sky , these dramatic images and video ( below ) show the raw power of an undersea volcano erupting .
The spectacular columns blasted out of the South Pacific yesterday six miles off the coast of Tonga 's main island Tongatapu .
The eruption can be seen clearly from the capital , Nuku'alofa , although residents only reported seeing smoke rising from the sea on Wednesday , two days after it is believed to have begun
' It 's a very significant eruption , on quite a large scale , ' said Keleti Mafi , head of the country 's geological service .
There she blows :
The undersea volcano erupts off the coast of Tonga sending plumes of smoke and steam into the sky
Towering above :
The sheer power of the volcanic eruption could be seen for many miles as smoke rose into the air
But authorities said today that the eruption does not pose any danger to islanders at this stage , and there have been no reports of fish or other animals being affected .
No warnings have been issued to the coastal villages close to the volcano , which is one of 36 undersea volcanoes clustered in that area .
The situation is being helped by trade winds which continue to blow gas and steam away from the island .
Choppy waters :
The rolling seas beneath the full fury of the undersea volcano which is part of a cluster of 36 in the area
Rare sight : Spectators edge closer to the drama being played out in front of them just six miles off Tonga 's main island of Tongatapu
Visible from space :

The eruption took place close to Hunga Tonga .
The main island below is Tongatapu
Those living nearby said the columns of steam and ash first appeared on Monday morning , after a series of sharp earthquakes were felt in the capital , Nuku'alofa .
' This is not unusual for this area and we expect this to happen here at any time , ' Mr Mafi said , adding that a similar eruption took place there in 2002 .
Scientists believe the underwater eruption was taking place to the west of the low - lying twin volcanic islands of Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai , within sight of Nuku'alofa .
Large amounts of pumice thrown up by the erupting volcano would be likely to clog beaches on the southern coast of nearby Fiji islands within a short time , he said .
Tonga , a 170 - island archipelago about halfway between Australia and Tahiti , is part of the Pacific ' ring of fire ' - an arc of earthquake and volcanic zones stretching from Chile in South America through Alaska and down through Vanuatu to Tonga .
Awe - inspiring :
The debris from the offshore eruption is expected to drift over to the southern coast of Fiji and clog its beaches
The column of steam and ash first appeared on Monday , after a series of sharp earthquakes were felt in Tonga 's capital , Nuku'alofa
No danger :
The smoke can be seen six miles off the main Tongan island of Tongatapu but it is not a threat to the health of residents of the island
The U.S. Geological Survey says that a 7.9 earthquake has struck near Tonga , prompting a tsunami warning for adjacent islands in the South Pacific .
The USGS says that the quake struck about 130 miles ( 200 kilometers ) south - southeast of the Tongan capital of Nuku' Alofa at a depth of 6.2 miles ( 10 kilometers ) .
It struck Friday morning local time .
There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has issued a tsunami warning for neighboring islands , but it was not immediately known if a tsunami had been generated .
It also advises that some coastal areas of Hawaii could see a rise in sea level and strong currents lasting up to several hours .
There has been a lot of buzz leading up to the world record attempt for the largest loop - the - loop ever performed in a car .
You probably accomplished this feat hundreds of times on your Darda car tracks when you were little .
I know I created some pretty crazy setups and had my windup sports cars pulling off some cool stuff .
So , when you look at this you must be thinking , piece of cake , right ?
Not so much …
Known as the “ Death Loop ” by professional stuntmen this thing has been attempted many times over the years on skateboards , motorbikes and trucks with a spotty record of successes mixed with some mobility - ending injuries and a smattering of death certificates .
The problem of why you do n’t just see dudes pulling these off left and right at car shows lies with the amount of G’s exerted on the driver .
Anything over 30 mph in this type of configuration can put so much stress on the body that maintaining consciousness becomes a herculean task .
So , who ’s the guy crazy enough to attempt this ?
Steve Truglia , an ex-SAS soldier - turned - stuntman , is about as hard core as it gets .
He ’s appeared in several Bond films and currently holds the world altitude record for skydiving .
He trained extensively both on the ground and in the air , with jet pilots offering techniques for handling ridiculous cetripetal forces .
So , how did he pull this off ?
Truglia drove a modified Toyota
Aygo with the front and back shaved off towards the 40 foot loop at precisely 37 mph .
As he headed up the ramp he changed gears to slow down to 16 mph as the car crossed the apex .
Along the way , Truglia tensed his arms , legs and abdomen to prevent blacking out .
The loop - the - loop stunt , sponsored by Dunlop Tires and Fifth Gear , will showcase its world premiere online , exclusively on the microsite at http://looptheloop.dunlop.eu at 5 pm EST tomorrow , Wednesday , May 20th .
It will be shown on Channel Five ’s Fifth Gear on Saturday , the 23rd ( if you live in the UK . )

Here are the download statistics for source tarballs and the darcs repository of xmonad , going back to April 2007 , when we initially released version 0.1
From April 2007 to March 2009 xmonad core source releases were downloaded more than 35 thousand times .
In addition , the darcs repository for xmonad was cloned 24 thousand times , and the xmonad - contrib extensions library was cloned 16 thousand times .
In total , xmonad source has been downloaded just over 75 thousand times in 22 months .
By March 2009 , the 0.8 release makes up just over 90 % of xmonad source downloads .
The extensions library also represents 45 % of xmonad checkouts now .
The most active source download time was December 2007 , prior to xmonad binary packaging in Linux distributions removing the need to build from source .
All major distributions currently ship with the current release of xmonad , making source builds unecessary .
These numbers only count xmonad tarball releases on hackage .
haskell.org , and the darcs repositories hosted on code.haskell.org .
It measures those intending to build xmonad from source , by hand ( or with cabal ) .
It does not include any downloads from mirrors , such as those provided by Linux and BSD distributions , and it does n’t track binary installations via the Linux distributions ( particularly Ubuntu , Debian , Fedora , Gentoo and Arch ) .
And , finally , we graph xmonad source installs per month against Debian popcon statistics ( to see whether there ’s some correlation between the decline in source downloads , and a rise in binary installs from distributions ) .
We directly overlay the popcon statistics from Debian :
Museums Turn to Open Source During Lean Times

Some of the organizations hardest hit by the sagging U.S. economy are non-profits and industries that rely on donations and public support to stay afloat .
Museums and cultural institutions are turning to open source software as one way to deal with declining attendance and lack of funding to cover operational costs .
We 've already mentioned one Web - publishing platform that makes historical archives accessible , but there are several other open source projects that address the different needs of museums .
They 're certainly worth a look by anyone who needs to manage a large collection or create an exhibit .
Fluid is a project that aims to build new user interfaces for the content management systems , navigation schemes , and educational portals museums currently use .
Its community , known as Fluid Engage , helps museum creators and gallery owners create multi-dimensional experiences that engage visitors via home computers , mobile devices , or an exhibit 's physical space .
Madrona is museum collection management system that includes several collaborative tools like image manipulation , shared calendars , Web integration and other features that allow cultural institutions manage collections of any size .
A paid pro version of Madrona is available but the equally powerful free version is just right for small museums with limited budgets .
CollectiveAccess is designed to manage large digital collections including images , audio , video , and documents .
It handles large , complex catalouges including all the metadata associated with each item .
Since it 's completely Web - based , CollectiveAccess can be used by teams working across large geographical locations via any computer platform .
The dossier was never intended to be made public ( though , the professor points out , since the law protects only material collected to assess a job applicant , it could have been ) and Justice Scalia was never supposed to know about the assignment , much the way many of us are blithely unaware about what can be discovered about ourselves online .
Professor Reidenberg ’s comments at the conference were picked up by a Web site , Above the Law , and the genie was out of the bottle , speeded on its way with the headline “ What Fordham Knows About Justice Scalia . ”
Another teaching moment .
Mr. Reidenberg was speaking about the loss of “ practical obscurity , ” that is , the idea that certain personal information may always have been publicly available  down at the courthouse , say  but in reality was very hard to discover and disseminate .
“ I was giving an academic paper in an academic conference , speaking about the loss of practical obscurity , and the example I use is plucked out of context and becomes a national story , ” he said .
When word leaked about the dossier , Mr. Reidenberg offered to show Justice Scalia what the class had collected , but he did not respond .

Privacy , and its breach , have been issues for millennia  Justice Scalia made his remarks about Internet privacy at a conference organized by the Institute of American and Talmudic Law titled “ The Right to Privacy and Individual Liberties From Ancient Times to the Cyberspace Age . ”
But technology is placing new stress on our laws , and the solutions are not always easy ones .
We finally met Bill O'Reilly 's stalker - producer Jesse Watters on Saturday .
It was a fleeting and civil encounter — jovial , even — but ultimately unsatisfying .
We asked him some questions about his stalking , and then he drove away , because he 's a coward .
We arrived at Watters ' house , nestled on a lovely suburban cul - de-sac deep among the winding byways of Huntington , N.Y. , bright and early at 6 a.m .
Your blogger was accompanied by Gawker video editor Richard Blakeley and P.J. Vogt , a producer for WNYC's " On the Media " who had asked to shadow us for a segment the show is preparing about ambush interviews .
We 'd traded in the beat - up 1998 Saturn station wagon festooned with Obama bumper stickers that we 'd driven on our previous outings for a rental SUV with tinted windows , which was less likely to attract attention in Watters ' neighborhood .
We parked in a spot down the street from Watters ' house with a good vantage point , and waited .
At about 8:45 a.m. , Watters walked out on to his driveway with his wife , Noelle , and we hopped out to talk to him .
When Watters ambushes people , he rushes at them in a deliberate attempt to rattle them , and asks hostile questions .
Not being complete dicks , we decided to approach it differently .
We introduced ourselves , said hello , and calmly approached him .
He got in his car and drove away .
We could have engaged some of the tactics that Fox has used in these situations — by say , running to meet him at his car and positioning ourselves so that he could n't close the door — but we did n't want to , because we were n't trying to engineer a confrontation .
We were trying to engineer an interview .
Even though Jesse did n't submit to that interview , we did get one answer :
His hurried departure leaves no doubt in our minds that his ambush tactics have nothing to do with the answers he claims to be seeking from O'Reilly 's enemies and everything to do with the theater of humiliation that Fox News thrives on and the us - against - them " culture war " that his boss believes he is waging .
If Watters honestly believed that people like ThinkProgress blogger Amanda Terkel and the New Yorker 's Hendrik Hertzberg — two targets that he ambushed without even inviting them on O'Reilly 's show first — have an obligation to answer for the things they do and say in the name of journalism , he would have recognized that obligation in himself .
If he honestly believed that people ought to defend themselves to his cameras , he would have been happy to defend himself .
And if he honestly believed that stalking and ambushing is a noble pursuit , he would have treated his own ambushers with professional courtesy and let us use his bathroom .
( OK , we would n't have let us use the bathroom either . )
But Watters does n't believe that — he believes the people he stalks are the enemy , to be attacked or evaded as necessary .
His segments are just partisan shitfights and grist for Fox 's enraged audience .
Watters is unconcerned about the accusation that he can dish out ambushes but can't take them , because he knows perfectly well that his ambushes are assaults and not , as Fox 's bullshit PR would have it , attempts to get answers .
And why would he just sit there and let himself be attacked ?
So he drove away , like a coward .
We 'd been trying to talk to Watters for two months , because we wanted to ask him some questions about his job .
Watters stalks and sneaks up on unsuspecting enemies of Bill O'Reilly and peppers them with questions so that his boss can air footage of them appearing to be flustered and confused .
He did it to Terkel , a who wrote something O'Reilly did n't like , after tailing her for two hours on a weekend getaway .
He did it to Bill Arkin , an NBC News analyst and Washingtonpost.com columnist who wrote something that O'Reilly did n't like , in front of his children after following him for 90 minutes across state lines .
And he did it to Hertzberg by laying in wait outside his New York apartment .
Watters has applied the same technique of leaping out of nowhere with a camera , a microphone , and a barrage of tendentious questions to dozens of others , from mayors to judges to governors to members of Congress , all of whom have crossed O'Reilly in word or in deed .
When he caught Mike Nifong , the prosecutor in the Duke lacrosse case , in his bathrobe and slippers outside his home , he later said he thought it was funny .
When Watters ambushed Meyera Oberndorf , the mayor of Virginia Beach , Va. , at her home and her husband tried to grab his mic , he thought it would make " great TV . "
Watters and O'Reilly justify these tactics by saying that because their targets wo n't submit to interviews , they have no choice but to seek them out : " If they do n't come to us , " Watters has written , " we 'll go to them . "
That is , as we 've noted before , a lie : Neither Terkel nor Hertzberg ever received an invitation to appear on O'Reilly 's program .
In April , the New York Times ran a story on Fox 's penchant for ambush interviews .
Watters declined to be interviewed for it .
We found his refusal cowardly beyond measure , given that his job is to force people who do n't want to be interviewed to submit to his questions .
We called him up to see if he'd talk to us , and he again refused .
We decided that if he would n't come to us , we 'd go to him .
So we drove out to Long Island a couple times to pay him a visit , but because we were a ) gentlemen enough to give him fair warning of our intentions and b ) fairly incompetent when it comes to stalking people , we whiffed .
But we met some of his neighbors , who despite calling the cops on us were very friendly .
We also met some representatives of local law enforcement , who despite pointing their service weapons at us were very friendly , and who wished us luck when we told them why we were there .
Though we 'd still love to actually ask Jesse questions about why he does what he does , and how he does it , we 're done with the 4 a .m. wake - up calls to drive out to Long Island and sit on his house .
We 've made our point .
But that does n't mean Jesse should n't have to answer for what he does .
So if you ever happen to run into him — maybe on the streets of downtown Huntington , N.Y. , or on the Long Island Railroad into Manhattan from Huntington , or around the News Corp. building at Sixth Avenue and 48th St. in Manhattan , or near his parents ' summer home in Pemaquid , Maine — do n't be afraid to politely and calmly walk up to him and ask him why he stalks people .
Let us know what he says .
Two men were caught having sex with a woman on a football field .
Shocked dog walkers alerted police after seeing the threesome cavorting together .
Adrian Parsons started kissing his girlfriend during a drinking session on the beach at Goring Gap , near Worthing .
They were both joined by Kevin Gilmartin who asked if he could join in .
The three left the beach and walked through woods to a sports field at Goring Hall Hospital .
Horrified witnesses saw Parsons having sex with his girlfriend who was naked from the waist down before Gilmartin joined in , Worthing Magistrates ’
Court was told yesterday .
Parsons , 41 , and Gilmartin , 45 , both admitted outraging public decency .
The court was told there are two schools nearby although all the children had gone home as it was 5.30 pm .
However , the sex session was witnessed by a teacher and an elderly woman who were out walking their dogs .
Jennifer Moss , prosecuting , said : “ They came across the group while Parsons was having sex with the woman .
“ They said another man joined in and was having sex with her . ”
She said Parsons ’s girlfriend was not charged with any offence after the incident on March 26 .
In a statement , the teacher – who was not named in court – said : “ I was disgusted by their behaviour .
Young children could quite easily have seen what they were doing . ”
Parsons , of no fixed address , was ordered to pay £ 193 in fines and costs .
Gilmartin , of Woodlands Avenue , Rustington , near Littlehampton , must do 80 hours unpaid community work .
District Judge Roger
Ede said : “ Sex is a private act not something that you do in front of others .
People should be able to walk their dogs without having to watch the three of you having sex together in public . ”
Laverda - based sidecar motorcycle - Click above for high - res image gallery
When most people think of sidecar motorcycles , visions of World War II - era BMWs likely spring to mind .
For others , however , " sidecar " may be translated a bit more literally .
Take François Knorreck of Italy .
After some 10,000 hours of work over a ten - year period and at a cost of 15,000 euros , Knorreck created a unique sidecar motorcycle called the Snaefell – likely named after the tallest peak on the famed Isle of Man .
Half the machine is based on the guts of a Laverda motorcycle , while the other half uses bits from a Volkswagen GTI Audi 80 and a Citroen Xantia Equally as interesting is this mashup that combines what appears to be an older British motorcycle with a cut - down Citroen 2 CV sidecar .
It seems both machines are in fully working order with the older 2 CV still sporting what we assume is an inoperative a steering wheel .
Check them both out in the gallery below .
" We know global climate change is happening and its going to challenge many different things some of them which will be so subtle we wo n't actually know about them until suddenly we realise – well that 's right , there used to be koalas in that patch of forest and they are n't there any more , " he said .
Big Pharma pollutes the world
Big Pharma is guilty of crimes against nature
Big Pharma has become a threat to life on Earth
Sources for this story include
( NaturalNews ) Pharmaceutical pollution is out of control , polluting the waterways of our world to such a disturbing degree that now evenare carrying detectable levels of pharmaceuticals in their own bodies !
A study conducted by Baylor University researcher Bryan Brooks , and published in , examined fish caught near Phoenix , Dallas , Chicago , Philadelphia and Orlando , testing them for residues of pharmaceuticals .
And what did the results show ?
That
The research was funded by a $ 150,000 grant from the EPA , and it found the fish to be contaminated with : • Seven different pharmaceuticals , including cholesterol drugs , blood pressure drugs , allergy drugs and psychiatric medications used to treat bipolar disorder and depression . •
Two different chemicals used as artificial fragrance in soaps .
These trace chemicals were found in fish near all of the sites tested ... except for one :
In order to establish a baseline reference of healthy , non-contaminated fish , researchers also caught fish in theof New Mexico , which is far from any cities or developments .
Care to guess what they found there ?
It is quite clear from this research thatand now poses a serious threat to our environment .
Big Pharma 's drugs pollute the world TWICE : First in the minds and bodies of those who take them , and then secondly in the rivers and oceans where toxic residues of the pharmaceuticals inevitably accumulate .
Remember this : Probably at least half of them are just flushed down the toilet or washed down the drains , which remains standard practice at hospitals .
Strikingly , even though they pose a significant ( and growing ) risk to the environment .
There is no question , for example , that pharmaceuticals are toxic to fish and aquatic mammals in much the same way they are toxic to humans .
Pill - pushing apologists , of course , claim that the trace levels of pharmaceutical found in the fish are so low that they are of no concern whatsoever .
To that ridiculous standard of safety , I say , " Prove it !
" To date , there have beenon the combinations of pharmaceuticals that are being found in public water supplies , waterways and oceans around the world .
Anyone who says these chemicals are safe is merely taking a wild ( and foolish ) guess .
They are also probably working for Big Pharma .
It is not the responsibility of environmentalists to prove that such chemicals are toxic to the environment .
Rather , it is the duty of drug companies to prove their chemicals are SAFE for the environment !
And that , by the way , cannot be done , because these drugs are , in reality , toxic to virtually all life forms , even at low doses .
The drug companies , bluntly stated , are The pharmaceutical residues found in fish are n't the only environmental problem with these drugs .
Even theof pharmaceuticals is extremely toxic to the environment .
Read this story entitled https://www.naturalnews.com/025415.html ) .
It tells the true story of enormous quantities of antibiotics being dumped into India 's rivers due to the manufacturing practices ofpharmaceutical companies .
Furthermore , last year anreport revealed pharmaceutical contamination of https://www.naturalnews.com/022809.html ) .
In reality , the water supplies of virtually ALL cities are contaminated with pharmaceuticals .
They just have n't done all the testing yet .
As I stated in that article : The drug companies are not merely a threat to your pocketbook and your own personal health ; through the mass chemical contamination of the world 's waterways , these drugs companies have actually become a threat to life on our planet .
That 's why I say it is within our rights as human beings living on this planet to call for the arrest and prosecution of Big Pharma 's executives for their crimes against humanity and crimes against nature .
They have polluted our planet with dangerous toxic chemicals , they have contaminated our public water supplies , and they have denied any responsibility whatsoever for their role in spreading their poisons and endangering the health of people who do n't even take medications !
I anxiously await the day that Big Pharma executives are marched through the streets , in handcuffs , on the way to their trials for crimes against humanity .
That day is coming .
And when these criminals are removed from society and prevented from doing further harm to our children , our family members , our water supply and our environment , the world will be a much healthier -- and safer -- place to live . , and the sooner this poisonous industry is stopped , the sooner we can see our personal and planetary health restored .

EU to impose tariffs on US biodiesel Decision comes in response to US subsidies , which have helped exponential growth in exports to Europe .
The European Union will impose tariffs on US biodiesel exporters for an initial period of six months following a decision on 3 March by an EU anti-dumping committee made up experts from the EU 's member states .
The tariffs , which will range from € 29 to € 41 per 100 kilogramme , come as a response to subsidies of $ 1 per gallon that the US government gives its domestic biodiesel industry .
The subsidy helped increase US biodiesel exports to Europe from 60,000 tonnes in 2006 to more than 1.5 millions tonnes in 2009 .
The European Commission ’s formal decision on the tariffs is likely to be published on 12 March and will come into force the following day .
It can be extended up to five years .
Raffaello Garofalo , the secretary - general of the European Biodiesel Board , welcomed the decision .
“ It will ensure a level playing - field , which we have long worked for .
It will be an end to a completely artificial situation where American biodiesel products have been dumped on the European market , ” Garofalo said , adding that 15 European producers have declared bankruptcy in the past two years and up to 50 further companies are operating far below capacity .
The American Chamber of Commerce said it was following " this case closely " , but added that " generally speaking , the distortion of markets caused by tariffs and subsidies in the agricultural sector is problematic " and that it wanted " EU - US co-operation to promote open , undistorted markets " .
Life ’s problems do not exist to beat you down .
They exist to help you grow .
Do you ever go to the gym , stare at all the dumbbells lining the wall , and exclaim , “ Dammit !
Why are there so many weights here ?
I ca n’t possibly lift all of them !
Look at how heavy they are !
Why ca n’t they just have a few easy weights and let that be enough ? ”
Of course that sounds silly , but this is precisely how many people react to the various problems that surface in their lives .
“ Dammit !
Why do I have to be overweight ?
Why can’t I just be thin and fit ?
Why are there so many delicious foods that make me gain weight ?
Why does exercise have to be so hard ?
I ’m so sick of being fat ! ”
“ Dammit !
Why does it have to be so hard to make money ?
How am I supposed to get out of debt when I can barely pay my bills ?
Why does it seem like every time I start to pull ahead , my car breaks down again ?
I ’m so sick of being broke ! ”
“ Dammit !
Why can’t I find a girlfriend ( boyfriend ) ?
I ’m a nice person , are n’t I ?
I ’m tired of lame dates with total idiots !
Maybe I should just be celibate .
Why does this have to be so hard ?
I ’m so sick of being alone ! ”
“ Dammit !
Why can’t I find a job I like ?
Why do I have to do stupid work I hate just to make money ?
What kind of life is this ?
How am I supposed to do what I love when I do n’t even know what that is ?
I ’m so sick of my job ! ”
Any of this sound familiar ?
Problems as Obstacles
The attitudes reflected above depict problems as obstacles .
They are roadblocks , annoyances , and irritations .
They get in the way of living .
They interfere with your peaceful enjoyment of life .
Given this mindset , you should do your best to prevent problems from arising whenever possible .
If a problem occurs , it means something went wrong .
It should have been anticipated and avoided .
An unavoidable problem represents bad luck or a cruel twist of fate .
Or perhaps it suggests you held the wrong thoughts and somehow attracted it via the Law of Attraction .
If you currently have problems on your plate , then you should try to eliminate them if you can .
Aim for the delicious nirvana of a problem - free existence — everything in its proper place and nothing to worry about .
This is a terrible mindset to hold .
The longer you think this way , the weaker you ’ll become .
This mindset puts you on a path with two primary branches .
The first branch leads to overwhelm .
Eventually your life gets filled with problems you ca n’t easily solve .
You ’ll probably resort to some form of escapism to cope ( such as via TV , web surfing , video games , excessive reading , alcohol and drugs , etc ) .
You ’ll get that slow sinking feeling that your life is slipping away from you .
When new problems arise , you ’ll become stressed , worried , or anxious .
The second branch leads to withdrawal .
You gradually check out from the world in order to reduce the problems you ’ll face .
You may justify this with words like simplification and minimalism .
If some part of your life gives you too much trouble , you try to surgically remove it .
You probably live alone and have few friends .
You favor work that ’s easy , unchallenging , and unrewarding .
The thought of living in a cave somewhere or meditating for days on end starts to sound like a good idea .
All you want is peace , peace , peace , but you never seem to be able to stay there for long .
Some annoyance always comes up .
There are other branches as well as variations of the two above , but for the most part , you ’re either headed toward stressful overtraining or long - term atrophy .
Either way , the longer you run these patterns , the weaker you become .
Eventually problems that did n’t seem so big five years ago now feel like terrible burdens .
“ Dammit !
Why did that light bulb have to burn out ?
Oh crap , I ’m outta bulbs too .
Now I have to go to the store .
Ehhh … I ’ll do it later .
I just do n’t have the energy to deal with this now . ”
Problems as Opportunities
Let me offer you a different way of thinking about problems that ’s a lot more empowering and a lot less whiny .
Problems do not exist to beat you down .
They exist to help you grow stronger .
Problems are like the dumbbells at the gym .
If you attempt to lift them , you may feel tired in the short run , but you ’ll grow stronger in the long run .
When you think about the various problems and challenges you ’re facing in life , you may be tempted to assume that the goal is to reach the solution state — to get past the problem .
But that ’s a very narrow and largely disempowering perspective .
That ’s like saying that the point of going to the gym is to reach the end of your workout .
A more productive perspective is to consider that the activity of solving problems is what really matters .
It ’s the activity , not the final solution state , that helps you grow .
Suppose that one of your problems is that you ’re broke and in debt .
If so , I imagine that ’s a problem you ’d very much like to solve .
You may feel desperate to arrive at a solution as quickly as possible .
But the greatest value is found in the activity of solving this problem , not in the end result .
One of the reasons I ’m doing well financially today is that I solved the problem of being broke about 10 years ago .
It was definitely not an easy problem to solve .
I had to go through a lot of difficult intermediate steps to become strong enough to solve it .
I made many adjustments to my attitude .
By lifting those weights , I grew stronger mentally , and my finances soon followed .
Consequently , I know that if I ever found myself broke at some point in the future , I could solve that problem again , probably much more quickly than I did the first time .
Even though I have more to lose these days from a financial perspective , I do n’t fear losing it .
I know I have the strength to bounce back .
My real gain was n’t money .
My real gains were inner strength , knowledge , and skill .
What would my life be like if I jumped instantly to the solution state without actually solving the problem on my own ?
Suppose I won the lottery .
At first it might appear that all my financial troubles were solved .
But I ’d actually be in a far worse position .
As I was going through that period of financial scarcity , I prayed that I did n’t experience a cash windfall .
I knew I had to solve the problem on my own .
I did n’t want to accidentally get a big inheritance and rob myself of crucial financial lessons and training .
When someone gave me lottery tickets as a gift , I got nervous because I was worried I might win .
It was hard dealing with some of those challenges , but I could see that my problems served a greater purpose .
They were helping to train me up .
Another benefit is that by solving these problems for myself , I ’ve been able to write many articles to share what I ’ve learned .
I could n’t have done that if I bypassed all those difficult lessons .
Physical problems build physical strength .
Mental problems build mental strength .
Social problems build social strength .
And all problems will on some level build spiritual strength ( or strength of character ) .
This mindset has a positive long - term outlook .
The longer you hold it , the stronger you become .
Problem - Solving Attitude Adjustment
I ’m pretty sure I learned the value of problem solving from my Mom .
For pretty much my entire life , she was a college math professor ( and still is ) .
She would often buy me books filled with problems to solve — math problems , visual problems , word problems , logic problems , etc .
You can find these books in any local bookstore .
That was her way of keeping me busy during summer vacation . 🙂
I grew to like these books , so I was exposed to lots of different problems as a child .
At first I was baffled by most of the problems in these books , and I could solve very few of them .
But I gradually got better .
When I was in the the fifth grade , I started learning BASIC computer programming , so that exposed me to even more problems .
I began to see problem - solving as something to do for fun and as a way to get smarter over time .
By the time I was in high school , I really enjoyed solving interesting problems .
If a teacher assigned more problems for extra credit , I would always do them — just for fun .
It was almost an addiction .
If I saw a problem , I got really curious and felt compelled to solve it .
Other students would sometimes come to me in the morning before school to ask for help with their math or science homework .
And I ’d help them .
Often we were n’t even in the same class , but I had a school - wide reputation as a good problem solver .
With the encouragement of one of my teachers , I also did some tutoring in math .
That was even better because I got paid to teach people problem - solving skills .
One morning my physics teacher walked up to me at my locker before school and asked me to step inside his classroom .
He presented me with a physics problem that he could n’t seem to solve .
I solved it easily , not because I was better than him at physics but because I ’d been exposed to such an enormous variety of problems that my mind just saw the solution .
That physics problem fit the pattern of a class of problems I already knew how to solve .
My solution was unusual for a physics problem , but it was n’t that unusual for a math problem .
During Christmas break in my senior year , I was bored during the two weeks off from school … partly because I had no serious problems to deal with .
So I opened my calculus textbook and started reading ahead and working through some problems .
I did it simply because I enjoyed the challenge .
After the holiday break ( at the start of my final semester of high school ) , I went up to my calculus teacher and handed him a big stack of papers .
I told him that during the holiday break , I completed all the homework he would assign for the rest of the year .
He said , “ But how did you know which problems I ’d assign ? ” I said , “ I did n’t , so I just did them all . ”
Typically he ’d assign 12 - 15 problems from each chapter for homework .
I probably did about four times that amount .
Of course that left my calculus teacher wondering , “ Now what the heck am I supposed to do with Steve for the next five months ?
He ’ll be sitting in class twiddling his thumbs the whole time . ”
He actually found creative ways to push me , giving me special assignments and take - home exams to do on my own .
During classes , I mostly tuned out from the lectures and wrote a blackjack game for my programmable calculator .
More problem solving .
It was only later in life that I realized how helpful it is to generalize this attitude beyond math , science , and logic problems and into the realm of practical daily existence .
For example , it ’s no secret that I despise accounting work .
I find it to be the most boring part of running a business .
I outsource most of it by using an accountant , but you can never totally disengage yourself from the numbers and financial obligations when running a business … unless you ’re in a position to request a government bailout because you ’re “ too big to fail . ” 😉
Instead of resisting the accounting work , I decided to see it as a training exercise .
The point is n’t to get to the end of the work and be done with it .
The point is to use the work to grow stronger .
Keeping the financial side of my business in good order helps me become more organized and efficient .
I know that if I can get really good at managing the financial side of my business , that training will serve me well for many years to come .
I could outsource more of this work , but right now I do n’t want to .
It would n’t be a good idea to do that yet .
This work is teaching me important lessons I need to personally integrate at this time in my business life .
Otherwise I risk screwing things up when I have more money and more business complexity to manage .
I can outsource more of it later , but right now I can tell that this training is still helping me get stronger .
I have to master the 20 - lb dumbbells before I can progress to 25 lbs .
Overcoming Overwhelm
If you ’ve been slacking off due to escapism , when you pull your head out of the sand , you may find yourself surrounded by problems that seem too heavy to lift — deep in debt , a dead - end job , a sucky relationship situation , a big belly , no sense of purpose , etc .
That ’s okay .
Just start with the lightest weights , and train up from there .
As you clear some of those minor problems , you ’ll begin feeling stronger and more hopeful .
Eventually you ’ll be ready to tackle some mid-sized problems … and then the really big ones .
Cleaning , organizing , and minor repairs are great places to begin .
Straighten your desk .
Clean the toilet .
Organize one shelf .
Clear your email inbox .
Hang that picture .
Remove the expired food from your fridge .
You can also use timeboxing for this .
Set aside a fixed period of time , say 30 - 90 minutes , and just make a dent in some of your problems .
When the time is up , you ’re free to stop , regardless of how much progress you ’ve made .
I often use timeboxing for tedious tasks like cleaning up a hard drive that needs better structuring of its folders .
I ’ll chip away at it for 30 minutes every few days until it ’s complete .
That way the task never feels too overwhelming .
The long - term benefit of dealing with little problems is that you get good at processing them quickly .
My parents are masters at this .
Every weekend they would tackle little problems in batches , so the house was clean , neat , and in good order at all times .
Think of a problem - solving session as a short workout for your mental discipline , much like going to the gym .
If you conduct these problem - solving workouts regularly , you ’ll gradually get stronger , and little problems will no longer seem so troublesome .
Getting Stronger
Solving problems increases your resourcefulness .
The more problems you solve , the better you get at problem solving .
This attitude adjustment can be very effective .
If you start seeing your problems as training exercises intended to make you stronger , you ’ll be able to face your problems with a can - do attitude .
You know it will be hard , and you accept that it ’s supposed to be hard .
The weight is supposed to be heavy , and the workout is supposed to be tiring .
If it was too easy , it would n’t help you grow .
You may feel some stress and strain when you ’re in the thick of a tough problem , but you ’d feel the same way doing a tough workout at the gym .
Do n’t bemoan your problems .
Be grateful for them .
They ’re training you to become smarter and stronger .
Learn to enjoy the training you ’re receiving .
Years from now you ’ll be grateful you had to deal with these problems because of how much stronger you ’ve grown .
Do n’t resist resistance training . 😉
Would n’t life be boring if we only had one browser to test our websites ?
It would be like 2002 all over again !
In a rapidly expanding browser market , QtWeb may have escaped your attention .
It is an open - source project that has only been available for a few months , but it is already in version 2 and could be of interest to web developers or those who rely on portable applications .
First and foremost , QtWeb is a lightweight and nimble browser .
The installation package is 5 Mb and there is a ZIP version that can be installed on a USB drive or any other location .
It works on any Windows version from 2000 and most users will just need the single QtWeb.exe executable .
Its minimal requirements means that QtWeb starts quickly and feels responsive .
The interface is reminiscent of Firefox but a little amateurish .
That said , it is functional , the icons are obvious , and the toolbars can be moved around at will – even outside the browser window .
It has all the standard features you would expect from a modern browser :
a search bar
bookmark import and export
tabs and session support
download management
blocking of pop-ups , cookies , JavaScript , and images
SSL , FTP and plug - in support
It even offers a unique virtual on - screen keyboard so you can enter secure data or passwords without worrying about key loggers .
As a portable browser , QtWeb easily beats the competition .
Copy the exe to a USB drive , import your bookmarks , and you have a secure browser that can be run from any Windows PC .
It is far faster and less resource - hungry than the portable edition of Firefox .
Whilst few people would use QtWeb as their default browser , developers should note that it uses the same WebKit rendering engine as Apple Safari and Google Chrome ( it is a slightly older version than Safari 4 Beta , but newer than Chrome ) .
In my brief tests , it rendered pages identically to both .
It also offers the excellent web inspector – a feature that is missing from Chrome :
I was impressed with QtWeb .
The developers identified their niche and make no presumptions about it taking over the browser market .
It is great for portable browsing , but is also ideal for quick and dirty WebKit testing without having to install Safari or Chrome on your development PC .

Two women take cover during one of several anti-government protests in Tehran , Iran , on Saturday .
PROTEST AND POLICE PROTEST AND POLICE
Riot police in Tehran fired tear gas and bullets in the air Wednesday in clashes with a few hundred protesters after Iran 's supreme leader declared that the disputed presidential election will stand and accused the United States and Britain of fomenting the protests .
Security forces beat the protesters gathered near the parliament building with batons , witnesses told the Associated Press .
Those who spoke to the AP requested anonymity out of concern for safety .
State - run Press TV said security forces dispersed the crowd of 200 , calling the gathering " an illegal rally . "
Iran ordered journalists for international news agencies to stay in their offices , so it 's difficult to verify reports on demonstrations .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs would not directly confirm a Washington Times report that President Obama sent a letter a month before the election June 12 to Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , calling for cooperation between the two countries .
Khamenei mentioned the letter in a sermon Friday , the Times said , citing Iranian and Lebanese websites .
Gibbs sidestepped whether Obama sent the letter , saying , " The administration has indicated a willingness to talk with the leadership in Iran " and has tried to " communicate with the Iranian people in a variety of ways . "
State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said , " We 're not going to get into the details of private diplomatic correspondence . "
From staff and wire reports Enlarge By Hasan Sarbakhshian , AP Zahra Rahnavard , wife of former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , wants protesters released .
Negar Mortazavi , who lives in Washington , D.C. , stays in touch with Iranian friends who have been protesting in Tehran .
On Saturday , a male student described on the phone violent clashes between protesters , police and plainclothes militia .
One scene stood out , and " he could n't believe his eyes , " said Mortazavi , 27 , who came to the USA from Iran in 2002 and is helping to coordinate protests in the United States .
" He decided it was time to start running when the police were coming .
He turned back and saw some women still standing , " she says .
" These women are not afraid . "
Iranian women have been on the front lines of anti-government protests challenging the official results of the June 12 election , in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the victor .
MORE : Video turns woman into icon of Iran unrest
The face of a woman has become the symbol of the opposition .
Music student Neda Agha Soltan , 27 , was captured on video dying of a gunshot wound .
The unsettling scene was transmitted around the world , and even President Obama referred to it this week .
Political protest is not new to Iranian women .
Yet , the extent of their activism in this election is unprecedented in the years since the 1979 revolution overthrew the U.S. - backed shah and created an Islamic regime , some Iranians and Iran experts say .
They cite several factors , including a growing population of young women who are hungry for social freedoms , the participation of prominent women during the campaign and promises by opposition candidates for advances in women 's rights .
On Wednesday , the wife of the main opposition candidate , Mir Hossein Mousavi , continued to speak out .
Zahra Rahnavard said on one of her husband 's websites that arrested protesters and activists should be released , the Associated Press reported .
She added that government should not act " as if martial law has been imposed on the streets . "
Rahnavard is an academic , writer and artist who campaigned alongside her husband .
" She was saying women are equal to men , that they need opportunities to participate , " said Dokhi Fassihian , a board member of the National Iranian American Council .
Rahnavard 's campaigning inspired Iranian women to get active and vote , she said .
" They are maybe even more active than the men are , " Fassihian said .
" They have the most to gain from changes , from seeing a new government in Iran . "
Isobel Coleman , senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , said she is " not surprised at all " by the level of participation among Iranian women .
Coleman is author of the forthcoming book Paradise Beneath Her Feet : Women and Reform in the Middle East .
Iranian women can drive , vote , own businesses , attend and teach college and hold political office , among other things .
At the same time , they have fewer rights than men in family and criminal law , Coleman said .
Iranian women are also required to observe Islamic dress , but how they comply ranges from the head - to - toe covering known as the chador to a strip of fabric covering some of their hair .
" What you 're seeing boiling to the surface right now is the unbearable weight of contradiction for women in Iranian society , " Coleman said .
In 2006 , Iranian female activists started the " One Million Signatures Campaign , " an ongoing effort to change laws that discriminate against women .
Ahmad Iravani , an Iranian ayatollah who teaches Islamic law at Catholic University of America in Washington , said Iranian women " have always been in front of any kind of protest ... especially when they feel , right or wrong , that injustice is going on . "
The desire for gender equality has grown as satellite dishes , the Internet and other technologies have allowed Iranians easier access to the outside world , he said , especially among the large youthful population in a country where the median age is 27 .
Fatemeh Haghighatjoo served in the Iranian parliament from 2000 to 2004 .
She and her colleagues passed a law to join an international convention calling for an end to discrimination against women , she said , but the law was vetoed by the country 's powerful Guardian Council , an unelected body of clerics .
Haghighatjoo , who resigned from the parliament to protest a government crackdown on activists , came to the USA in 2005 and is a visiting scholar at the University of Massachusetts - Boston .
She agreed that Iranian women have been particularly active in this campaign , and believes they were energized by promises from some candidates for more gender equality .
" They 're fighting at this very moment to create a better future for their children , " she said .
" I am hopeful . "

John 's Beekeeping Notebook
Backyard Beekeeping
Notes on Keeping Bees in Urban and Suburban Neighborhoods
Many beekeepers have bee hives in their back yards .
Some bees are even kept on city roof - tops .
Bees can travel several miles to collect nectar and pollen , so they do not need flowering plants close by .
Most suburbs have plenty of flowers , and bees can make a good crop of local honey .
City beekeepers must take special care so their bees do not become a nuisance to neighbors , or even appear to be a problem .
We all want good neighborly relations !
Bee stings are usually neighbors ' biggest concern .
Usually , beekeepers can care for their bees in ways that allow neighbors to feel safe and comfortable in their yards .
The Fence
A Fence is important for most backyard beekeepers .
A six foot high fence or shrubbery can serve several purposes :
Forces the bees flight path above people 's heads .
Bees normally travel in a straight path to their hive , and a fence raises their flight path up over everyone 's head .
A fence reduces the chance that a bee will accidentally collide with someone walking nearby .
Creates an " out of sight - out of mind " situation .
Some people may be overly concerned about bees in the neighborhood .
A fence hides most evidence that managed bees are in the neighborhood .
Provides wind protection to the hives .
Water
Honey bees need to collect water , particularly in early spring and during the heat of summer .
Bees can be fussy about where they collect water .
They seem to love small ponds and creeks .
The bees may also drink from a dog's drinking bowl , or a neighbor 's bird bath or swimming pool .
To deter bees from going to a neighbor 's yard for a drink , the suburban beekeeper should provide water for their bees .
Two successful ways to provide water are to ( 1 ) Start a small water garden in a half - whiskey barrel with floating plants .
The bees seem to love it , since they prefer well - aged water !
( 2 ) Use a dripping faucet , with the drips falling on to a wooden board .
The dripping faucet is harder to manage , since it must be available at all times when bees are flying so they do not develop a habit of going elsewhere .
Bees seem to prefer water that is not TOO close to their hive , so I put a water source at least 20 feet away .
Swarm Control
There is no practical way to prevent swarming with 100 % success .
However , swarms are usually very gentle because the bees eat a lot of honey before they swarm .
In the photograph at left , a swarm is scooped up from a neighbor 's yard .
Strong colonies with good queens are most likely to swarm .
Of course , we want strong colonies .
The solution is to keep colonies headed by young queens , less than one year old , because they will swarm less and tend to be strong too .
This requires requeening each year with young queens if swarms are likely to be a problem .
When bees swarm , they typically form a cluster within 100 feet of their old hive while scout bees search for a new home .
" Bait hives " are a good way to discourage swarms from going into a neighbor 's yard .
A bait hive is simply an attractive home waiting for a swarm to discover .
A good bait hive can be made from an old hive body or nuc hive that is at least one cubic foot in volume and an opening size of about 1 or 2 square inches .
The ideal place to put a bait hive is in a shady , wind - protected place , between 10 and 30 feet from the hives , and about ten feet off the ground such as under the eve of a house or between branches of a tree .
Bees also prefer to live someplace where bees have lived before , so a bait hive will be more attractive to the bees if it has an old frame of honey comb in it or otherwise has a good bee - smell .
Working the Bees
When working inside a hive , it is possible that an angry bee will find an innocent nearby person ( other than the beekeeper ) to be a suitable target for a sting .
Fortunately , there are ways of preventing that from happening !
The defensiveness of bees is greatly influenced by environmental conditions .
A beekeeper who works with the bees when conditions are good will have few , if any , angry bees .
The same bees that are gentle on one day can become very defensive on another day .
The best conditions to work with the bees are when :
Most of the field bees are out in the field collecting nectar
When there is a nectar flow from flowering plants
When the colony is not under stress from predators , such as wasps .
When colonies are in direct sunlight
When the temperature is not very hot ( 95 degrees F or higher )
When neighbors are not having a lawn party or mowing their yard
Langstroth 's first Bee- keeper 's Axiom is a good one to remember : " Bees gorged with honey are not inclined to sting . "
This means that the bees will tend to be gentle when there is a nectar flow , when they swarm and following a light smoking .
Bees that are accustomed to movement around their hive reportedly are also less likely to be defensive , so having bushes , trees , a flag or other objects that move in a mild wind are worth considering .
Angry bees are sometimes attracted to lights at night .
Bees normally do not fly at night , but if a predator or something else has disturbed the hive , a few bees may attempt to sting the neighbor 's porch light .
It is best if nearby neighbor 's outdoor lights are not in direct view of the hive .
" Yellow rain " can be a minor problem to neighbors ' cars that are parked within about 50 feet of the hives .
The yellow specks that bees leave when they take cleansing flights wash off easily , but can be unsightly if there are a lot of hives in the area .

Square Denies Final Fantasy 14 PS3 Exclusivity , ' Considering All Options '
Following up on the surprise announcement
" We are considering all options at this time , " Square Enix senior VP Shinji Hashimoto stated , via translator , at a press conference today .
He stressed that FFXIV should not be considered a PS3 exclusive , noting that " all options " includes Microsoft hardware .
" We do n't want to make a copy of World of Warcraft , " a company representative added .
As for why Square opted to create an entirely new MMORPG instead of porting Final Fantasy XI to PlayStation 3 and continuing to expand the world , the company said that " to have a [ all - inclusive ] sequel to FF11 [ on a next - gen system ] , you 'd have to port the original one , and to port it would take too much time . "
Rather than port Final Fantasy XI while adding new content and upgrades , the company decided to do something new .
Though reluctant to discuss specific gameplay features , Square noted its intent to develop and expand the job system to be " something quite different " than what was in Final Fantasy XI .
" We are trying to implement a lot of new systems other MMOs have n't used in the past , " a member of the development team teased .
Square hopes to provide content for all the different styles of MMO play , explaining that " if you want to play in a solo , you can play solo .
If you want to play 40 minutes in a day , you can play 40 minutes in a day .
If you want to play all day , you can play all day . "
The studio also took the time to clarify that the trailer released yesterday was indeed a mix of pre-rendered and in -engine visuals , and noted that Final Fantasy XIV will not use the PlayOnline infrastructure of Final Fantasy XI .
At present , Final Fantasy XIV is slated for a worldwide simultaneous launch on PlayStation 3 and PC at some point in 2010 .
America ’s political scene has changed immensely since the last time a Democratic president tried to reform health care .
So has the health care picture : with costs soaring and insurance dwindling , nobody can now say with a straight face that the U.S. health care system is O.K .
And if surveys like the New York Times / CBS News poll released last weekend are any indication , voters are ready for major change .
The question now is whether we will nonetheless fail to get that change , because a handful of Democratic senators are still determined to party like it ’s 1993 .
And yes , I mean Democratic senators .
The Republicans , with a few possible exceptions , have decided to do all they can to make the Obama administration a failure .
Their role in the health care debate is purely that of spoilers who keep shouting the old slogans 
Government - run health care !
Socialism !
Europe !
 hoping that someone still cares .
The polls suggest that hardly anyone does .
Voters , it seems , strongly favor a universal guarantee of coverage , and they mostly accept the idea that higher taxes may be needed to achieve that guarantee .
What ’s more , they overwhelmingly favor precisely the feature of Democratic plans that Republicans denounce most fiercely as “ socialized medicine ”  the creation of a public health insurance option that competes with private insurers .
A group of Scotland Yard officers has been suspended after " serious allegations " about their behaviour during the arrests of five suspects last year , police say .
London 's police force did not go into detail , but Sky News television , the and of London newspapers reported that six officers were accused of " waterboarding " drug suspects .
The papers gave varying accounts of the exact technique used by police , with saying officers poured water on a cloth and placed it over a suspect 's face to simulate the experience of drowning .
The said police officers repeatedly dunked the suspects ' heads in buckets of water .
The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear .
In an email statement , Scotland Yard said that it was " not appropriate to make assumptions " about what the officers did .
While a spokesman for the force refused to comment on the nature of the allegations , the statement acknowledged they were grave and " do raise real concern " .

" We keep giving you gifts , " says Neil Young , whose Archives Vol. 1 has hidden tracks and downloadable updates , plus every song he wrote from 1963 to 1972 .
SANTA MONICA , Calif . 
The harvest is in .
After more than 20 years of plots , plans , pursuits and promises , the first installment of Neil Young 's multimedia library has arrived .
Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 : 1963-1972 , in stores today , compiles every song he wrote and recorded in that period , plus all significant performances , amplified by copious personal photos , documentary footage , studio notes , letters , film trailers , radio spots , diary entries , press clips and handwritten lyrics .
Wildly understating its breadth , Young says , " It 's like a scrapbook . "
YOU GOT MAIL : From Neil Young , via Blu-ray LISTEN : ' Dance Dance Dance ' via Windows Media LISTEN : ' Dance Dance Dance ' via QuickTime
The set is on Blu-ray , DVD , CD and as a download , the latter two considered least desirable by Young , notorious for his high - fidelity obsession and aversion to digital sound .
The 10 - disc Blu-ray version ( $ 300 ) is widely considered a game - changer in both tech and music realms .
Rolling Stone calls
Archives , the first in a series of five , " the high - water mark for box sets .
...
It 's built for fanatics , yet the goods could make a fanatic out of anyone . "
The interactive , endlessly updatable Blu-ray edition " sets the bar at a level even the keepers of the Fab Four 's legacy will be challenged to match , " the Los Angeles Times says .
" Talk about giving you bang for the buck , " says Jim DeRogatis , Chicago Sun -Times pop music critic .
" I do n't know if everyone wants the postcards he sent to his mom in Canada , but , boy , he 's giving you everything .
The music sounds incredible , and it's not like he 'll sell it to you again in three years .
Contrast that to The Beatles and Elvis , who repackage the same product over and over . "
Seated in manager Elliot Roberts ' office , Young manipulates a PlayStation controller as he eagerly conducts a 90 - minute demo .
" We keep giving you gifts , " says the rock veteran , in jeans , a Fender T - shirt and sandals .
He locates hidden tracks and downloadable updates along an interactive timeline .
Hearing 1963 instrumental The Sultan , he says , " The world was n't quite ready for my voice . "
LISTEN UP : Newest from Rancid , Iggy Pop and more A collector of cars and toy trains , Young , 63 , was meticulous about hoarding and cataloging his recordings and ephemera .
Music and artifacts were n't the hurdles repeatedly delaying Archives ' release .
" It was always the technology that stopped us , " he says .
" When we started in the ' 80s , we were waiting for DVD .
We thought DVD was the ultimate .
But we discovered you could n't browse and listen at the same time .
" That 's the beauty of Blu-ray .
You can surf around while the music 's playing .
That 's the way it used to be when you listened to an album and read the liner notes .
Now it 's deeper .
You can easily get lost in this . "
Young 's reach initially exceeded Blu-ray 's grasp .
" We worked with Blu- ray 's design group on the standards , " he says .
" We said , ' Why ca n't we do this ? '
They said , ' Maybe we can , ' and they 'd write it in the program . "
Immersed in the second volume , which is expected in two or three years , Young also has mapped out the third and fourth and continues to mine sources for buried nuggets .
He was dismayed to discover the BBC had destroyed several early Young performances .
But his search for rare Buffalo Springfield concert footage turned up a Hollywood Bowl show , and a hi-res version of Mr. Soul soon will be available as a Blu-ray download .
" There are so many great artists I 'd love to see fleshed out this way , like Jimmie Rodgers , Hank Williams , Bob Dylan or Kurt Cobain , " he says .
" You could do a Renaissance painter , the Civil War or the evolution of recorded sound .
It 's like a virtual encyclopedia . "
What did graying Young learn about young Young during Archives ' construction ?
" I was surprised by some of my decisions , " he says .
" I moved away instead of exploring some things more .
I write it off to moving so fast I could n't see what was in front of me . "
The set 's illuminating timeline excludes personal matters , though there 's plenty of career drama , he promises .
" The most depressing point is when CDs come along , " he says .
Blu-ray , which holds up to 60 times as much digital data as an MP3 , " is the highest - resolution clarity available now .
Ultimately , we 'll go to something better .
Analog and tubes and gas may seem like a step back , but I still believe it 's more human . "

In a brutal and frightening post - apocalyptic world , who will survive ?
Dean Maddock
1. The Sand Nomad
An unusually bright young sand nomad has stumbled upon a lost airplane graveyard and has begun to cannibalize bits and pieces of lost aircraft in an attempt to create his own rudimentary design .
Realizing that aluminum is valuable in the post - apocalypse world , he occasionally comes into town to trade the scrap for supplies and the occasional tool or part .
Whether he hires the characters to help him , they ’re sent to follow and track him ( make it difficult — he knows how to lose people in the sand ) , or they simply stumble upon his treasure trove in the wastes , they will soon discover that the entire place is boobytrapped in sneaky ways that make assaults ( especially running - screaming ones ) extremely difficult to do without losing more men than the scrap is worth .
Does he hire the characters as bodyguards ?
Does someone else send them in to check things out ?
It ’s all up to you .
2. The Bug-out Spot
In the course of a mission , the players stumble across someone ’s bug - out spot .
It could be empty , locked , long abandoned , or it could be still in active use .
How big it is , how well stocked or well defended is entirely up to you .
3. The Ranchers
In the deep parts of the wastes , the players run across a ranch that has fallen into neglect , with a few bony livestock starving slowly to death in the dry and rotting garden .
Inside , but too busy to stray from his work for long , a man and his two pre-teen children will come out and enthusiastically greet them , dressed from head to toe in exotically handcrafted helmets , vests , and pants made from wires , aluminum foil , and hubcaps .
Inside , they ’re working feverishly on a starship , and they ’re all too willing to talk about the beings of starlight who have descended to the wastes of Earth to spread a message of peace .
Whether or not the aliens are real is up to you , ( as is their real message / purpose if they are ) but the ranchers are perfectly willing to let them stay the night if they want to find out for themselves .
4. Nomadic Caravans
In some cases , traveling in a nomadic caravan of cannibalized vehicles is the safest way to survive the apocalypse .
It gives you strength in numbers , as well as the option to run away from anything you ca n’t run over .
During the course of their travels , you can make caravans a regular encounter , send them on missions to track down specific groups of motorized nomads , or even send heavily armed caravans after them , bent on obtaining rewards or retribution .
5 . The Seductress
During the course of a visit to a settlement during trade negotiations with a caravan , a beautiful young woman seduces one of the men in the player ’s group and even goes so far as to stow away on their vehicle or follow them .
She seems convinced that she is in love with the guy , and will keep him busy satisfying his fantasies as she does anything she can to gain the trust of the entire group — anything .
In the end , when it ’s least expected and the opportunity presents itself , she ’ll split with everything they own , leaving nothing of value that she can’t carry behind .
6. The Desert Stalkers
Somewhere during their wanderings , the players stumble across a stretch of ground controlled by a group of desert stalkers who only reveal themselves in an ambush .
They could be members of a survivalist cell , a group of mercenaries actively hunting the players , or even a bizarre cult looking for converts or sacrifices .
Either way , the players have two choices : surrender , or fight to the death and escape .
7 . The City on a Hill
John Aquinas is a man with a dream .
Building on a foundation of the ruins of a previous civilization ’s metropolis , he has inspired his congregation to band together to create a new civilization — the city on a hill , heaven on earth — but is it really as enlightened as it seems ?
Is there a real hope here , or is there some hidden flaw in this city of light that ultimately makes is more terrible and twisted than the apocalyptic land it sprung from ?
There are a thousand different ways you can introduce this one — a starting place , a goal , a target , or even a random encounter .
8. The Facility
There are a thousand strange things and places hidden from the public eye that have been abandoned and forgotten in the world today , and even more that would be left unattended in the event of a world - shattering apocalypse .
Putting a bioweapons lab , a nuclear reactor , or some other underground facility full of dangers and treasures sealed behind the vault doors of a high - technology facility in the path of the players can lead to some interesting encounters , problems , or world - changing events .
9 . The Diseased Village
The players enter a village wracked by an illness , but they ’re so desperate to trade with outsiders that they take great pains to hide it ... until one of the players becomes infected .
Suddenly , the true extent of the disease ’s spread is revealed , and the only solution is to go out and hunt down the source — or the cure .
If you ’re strapped for ideas , it could be radiation sickness from fragments of a nuke recovered by the villagers , an exotic disease brought in from the vault of a cracked bio lab in the deep desert , or even a resurgence of something simple like scurvy ( or vicious , like the plague ) .
10 . What Is That ?
The players come across something truly bizarre and out of place in the middle of the wastes .
It could be a rich and healthy patch of crop plants heavy with fruit or vegetables in an area that is totally inhospitable to life , a crater full of oddly metallic debris and fused glass , or a valley of blue crystal that seems alive , almost as if the interior of each crystal were liquid .
Why it ’s here , in this particular middle of nowhere , and what its presence means is entirely up to you .
11 . The Stranger
A young man pushes his way into the bar where the players just happen to be , trying to gather together a group of people to go with him to a place he claims he ’s found a way to that is still untouched by the apocalypse .
He ’s young , idealistic , and so green that it hurts , and since it ’s painfully obvious , no one seems willing to believe him .
He may even approach the players , get in their faces , and try to convince them .
If they accept , this can be a great opener to a new campaign , a great way to introduce new characters ( other people in the same bar who join ) , and a great reason to stick shadier people into the storyline who watch and follow the group from a distance .

Roughing in the Line Work for The Last Guardian Soundtrack and Print Art
Hilary Berseth , an artist / beekeeper , makes his sculptures by coaxing bees into making their comb in specific shapes .
It 's no wasp factory , but it 's still awfully lovely .
Artists from Rodin to Warhol to Mark Kostabi have outsourced the construction of their work .
Hilary Berseth goes them one better :
He constructs basic frameworks of wire and wax , then lets teams of tiny yellow - and - black art fabricators finish the job .
" I knew they were ordered and regimented , " the Pennsylvania artist says about his honeybees , which built the three otherworldly sculptures on view at Eleven Rivington .
" I had an intuition that I 'd be able to organize that , architecturally . "
Berseth 's armatures each go into a closed box in the spring , and then the respective colonies take over , filling out his templates with wax cells , then stuffing them with honey .
" The last two seasons , I 've been working with a beekeeper whose name is Jim Bobb , " he says , explaining where he turns for expertise .
" He has a graduate degree in mathematics from Berkeley –he 's a minor beekeeping celebrity . "
Sometimes , words matter .
Crispian Jago brought this up recently on his blog , discussing the difference between the words " skeptic " and " denier " .
I have used the phrase " global warming denialists " in the past and gotten some people upset .
A lot of them complain because they say the word denial puts them in the same bin as holocaust deniers .
That 's too bad .
But the thing is , they do have something in common : a denial of evidence and of scientific consensus .
Moon hoax believers put themselves in this basket as well ; they call themselves skeptics , but they are far from it .
Skepticism is a method that includes the demanding of evidence and critical analysis of it .
That 's not what Moon hoax believers do ; they make stuff up , they do n't look at all the evidence , they ignore evidence that goes against their claims .
So they are not Moon landing skeptics , they are Moon landing deniers .
They may start off as skeptics , but real skeptics understand the overwhelming evidence supporting the reality of the Moon landings .
If , after examining that evidence , you still think Apollo was faked , then congratulations .
You 're a denier .
Really , it 's this difference that biases people against skeptics like me .
I am always accused of having a closed mind -- of being a denier .
But that 's not only not true -- I can be convinced I am wrong by evidence or a logical argument -- but it 's usually the person accusing me that has a mind closed against reality .
No matter how much evidence you put in front of them showing them clearly and obviously that they are wrong , they refuse to see it .
Just go read the comments on my latest UFO post for evidence of that .
I guess the most ironic thing of all is that people who say I should be more open - minded are too open - minded , and have closed their mind to the one true thing : reality itself .
Goldman indicated in early February that it would seek to repay the funds , and since then , several other banks have said they would like to do the same .
Not all banks , however , are likely to bounce back as quickly as Goldman , despite expectations that other banks will report strong results for the first quarter .
Goldman announced profits of $ 1.66 billion in the quarter , or $ 3.39 a share , a strong comeback from a loss in late 2008 .
Goldman ’s profit was propelled by record revenue of $ 6.56 billion in its fixed - income , currency and commodities unit , where mortgage and other credit instruments are traded .
Over all , Goldman ’s revenue was $ 9.43 billion , up 13 percent from the first quarter a year ago .
/ Mr. Viniar said on Tuesday morning that the bank was able to generate much of its revenue by trading “ plain vanilla ” investments .
Margins were higher than usual , he said , in part because of the disappearance of some of Goldman ’s former competitors , like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers .
“ Many of our traditional competitors have retreated from the marketplace , ” Mr. Viniar said .
Goldman reported its results a day ahead of schedule , setting a positive tone for other bank results expected in the coming week .
While several small banks have returned TARP money , Goldman so far is alone among large institutions to seek to do so .
Last Tuesday , Lloyd C. Blankfein , Goldman ’s chief executive , visited Washington to speak before an industry conference , and to meet with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner .
Though rumors have swirled about Goldman ’s payback , it was only last week in that meeting that Mr. Blankfein formally asked to return the money and detailed his plan to raise more private capital .
Goldman said on Monday that it would seek to raise $ 5 billion by selling new common stock and use the proceeds , along with other funds , to repay the government .
The amount Goldman owes will be higher than the $ 10 billion because of warrants that the government was granted that must be valued by an independent firm .
Goldman said in a statement on Monday that returning the TARP money depended on the results of a stress test that federal bank examiners were in the process of administering to Goldman and other big banks .
Goldman did not address the bonds that it issued with government backing last fall .
While Goldman reported a strong first quarter , it also reported a loss of $ 1 billion in the month of December , underscoring how quickly its fortunes can change .
That month was reported on its own because Goldman is changing the timing of its fiscal year by a month , to match the calendar year .
The loss was in part related to write - downs on high - yield bonds , as well as deterioration in real estate .
This Page shows the current Fairy Doors in Ann Arbor , MIchigan .
Each thumbnail links to a page , which elaborates on the specific location of the fairy door , represented .
The Pin map shows the distribution of the tiny doors .
The fact that MOST are clustered in central Ann Arbor leads to the descriptive term : " Urban Fairies " .
As of this posting , the fairies have been to ; our house , Sweetwaters Café , Peaceable Kingdom , Selo Shevel Gallery , Jefferson Market , The Ark , The Ann Arbor Framing Company , Lakewood Elementary School , Red Shoes and Voilà .
Tiny doors have been the principle element in common .
Some of the location have tiny windows and even elaborate interior spaces as well as fairy doors .
The miniature doors match or coordinate with the larger human doors of each location .
Each fairy location also seems to be a uniquely Ann Arbor setting .
I will try to add any new locations of fairy doors just as soon as I become aware of them .
I will also add new photos as I take them .
I am working with local photographer , Bob Foran , to substitute his photos of the fairy doors for mine .

September 2 , 2008 : Sarah Palin's " First Dude " Todd turns out to have been a registered member of the secessionist Alaskan Independence Party .
November 4 , 2008 : America laughs in Sarah Palin 's crazy wingnut face one last time , and finishes her candidacy off with the GOP " superstar 's " approval ratings swirling the bowl .
April 5 , 2009 : Pittsburgh cop killer Richard Poplawski's best friend Edward Percovic made a special point of telling reporters :
We recently discovered that 30 states had declared sovereignty .
One of his concerns was why were these major events in America not being reported to the public .
April 6 , 2009 : Palin , responding to the North Korean missile test , says :
I am deeply concerned with North Korea ’s development and testing program which has clear potential of impacting Alaska , a sovereign state of the United States , with a potentially nuclear armed warhead .
April 9 , 2009 : Texas Governor Rick Perry ( R ) holds a press conference in support of state House Concurrent Resolution 50 , declaring :
WHEREAS , The Tenth Amendment assures that we , the people of the United States of America and each sovereign state in the Union of States , now have , and have always had , rights the federal government may not usurp
At the press conference , Perry declares :
We think it ’s time to draw the line in the sand and tell Washington that no longer are we going to accept their oppressive hand in the state of Texas .
That ’s what this press conference , that ’s what these Texans are standing up for .
There is a point in time where you stand up and say enough is enough , and I think Americans , and Texans especially have reached that point .
April 14 , 2009 : Crazy Glenn Beck approves :
I have to tell you , you know , I 've been a little iffy on Governor Perry because of the way he 's handled the border in the past .
I did n't think he was real tough on the border , but holy cow .
What a statement coming from him on state sovereignty .
And as if to close the circle , April 14 , 2009 , Crazy Glenn Beck takes the talk back all the way around the loony dial :
So I ’m sorry , California , but I do n’t want to go down your road .
You ca n’t force me to go down your road .
Does the individual have any right anymore ?
Does the state have any right any more ?
And I know , because I ’ve heard it from all of the conservative – you know , historians and scholars and everything else , but you ca n’t convince me that the founding fathers would n’t allow you to secede .
Finally , Teabagging Day , April 15 , 2009 - Crazy Glenn
Beck shows just enough leg to get the job done , but still retain what we 'll have to call less - than - plausible deniability , by having Greta van Susteren do the dirty deed of saying the word aloud for him .
“ It almost looks like Texas is looking to secede from the rest of the nation . ”
And the crowd goes wild :
In several states , I believe it 's 23 now , they are passing this in their legislature , which says " You do n't have any more rights in the Constitution than those that are outlined , and federal government , you need to back off . "
Oh , how coy !
By sheer coincidence , Crazy Glenn Beck uses his time in the teabagging spotlight to remind everyone of ... exactly what the Pittsburgh cop killer 's best friend made a special point of saying when he had the microphones .
Just like the sheer coincidence of Crazy Glenn Beck stumbling into the vampire metaphor , which just happens to be a favorite of the black helicopter crowd .
That boy sure knows how to dog whistle , do n't he ?
So here 's the basic lesson of the teabagging hissy fit .
The new Republican " theory " of democracy :
GOP wins : " Mandate !
Elections have consequences ! "
GOP loses : " Tyranny ! Fascism !
Revolution !
Secession !
Think about that .
And think about how they used to tell you with a straight face that when Republicans won , " the adults were back in charge . "
Think about that when the Sinn Fein arm ( with apologies , I guess , to the actual Sinn Fein ) of this Idiot Republican Army arrives back in Washington to plead oh - so - earnestly that they just want " bipartisan compromise . "
Think about that when they tell you they demand a say in how we fix health care , rebuild our economy and protect working peoples ' rights to build better lives for themselves and their families .
While you were working for these changes back home , they were feeding the rump end of their " base " in the hopes that they 'd spike any and every deal .
Think about how wise it is to seek " compromise " with vipers who will , the moment they do n't get their way , turn and hiss , " Revolution ! Secession ! "

More recently , Saccharomyces has served as an agreeable model organism in the laboratory , an excellent way to explore how genes behave and cells divide and a much cheaper date than a rodent .
Fungal cells turn out to be surprisingly similar to animal cells , and researchers recently determined that the fungal and animal lineages did n’t split from each other until millions of years after both had branched away from the plants .
The defining traits of a fungus are gustatory and architectural .
Whereas animals ingest a meal first and then digest it internally , fungi do the reverse .
After latching on to a suitable food source , they release enzymes to break down the substance into a soupy mash of sugars and amino acids , which they can then absorb through the membranes of their filamentous hyphae .
Some fungi remain simple , even unicellular , but others can sprout elaborate fruiting bodies packed with billions of microscopic spores , billions of wistful homuncular fungi .
The most familiar fruiting bodies are the mushrooms , with their vivid pigments of inscrutable purpose and their still more inscrutable forms  here a swollen pink pincushion or a bird ’s nest filled with eggs , there a protruding black tongue or a batch of bright butter coral .
Given sufficient food and room , the filaments of a founding fungus may grow over thousands of acres of soil and persist for centuries or millennia , all the while spawning genetically identical mushrooms above ground , and biologists have argued that such hyphal masses qualify as some of the largest and most ancient organisms on Earth .
Most fungi are adapted to grow in cool or foresty temperatures , maybe 60 , 70 degrees Fahrenheit , which is why the pathogens among them tend to prey on plants , or cold - blooded animals like insects , reptiles or amphibians .
Even then , most fungal diseases are not fatal , and the virulent strain that is thought to be involved in today ’s mass amphibian die - offs may have been introduced into natural populations by frogs used in medical research .
With their hot body temperatures , mammals and birds suffer from few fungal diseases save those confined to the coolish epidermis .
Bats are mammals , but the species now afflicted by white - nose syndrome are cave - hibernating bats , and when the bats lapse into their hibernation torpor , said David S. Blehert , a microbiologist with the United States Geological Survey ’s National Wildlife Health Center in Madison , Wis. , their core body temperature drops down to just a couple of degrees above cave conditions , as low as 44 degrees .
“ This pathogen is treating the bats as if they were forgotten tubs of cottage cheese in the back of the refrigerator , ” Dr. Blehert said .
Moreover , the fungus appears to be unusually virulent .
“ We ’re seeing in excess of 90 percent mortality at some sites , ” Dr. Blehert added .
Since the disease was first identified west of Albany in March 2007 , it has spread to bats in nine states and is on the cusp of reaching bat populations that aggregate in groups 300,000 strong , “ the largest colonies of hibernating mammals known on the planet , ” Dr. Blehert said .
In an effort to block the pathogen ’s passage , wildlife authorities are closing off caves to human traffic , for now the only measure they can think of to keep the wrath of Robigus at bay .
If You Meet Jesus On The Road , Kill Him
A famous old piece of Zen wisdom says : “ If you meet Buddha on the road , kill him . ”
There are a couple of reasons why we are called to take Buddha out .
The most commonly cited reason is that the prophet in the road is not really Buddha at all , but a figment of our imaginations — a psychological projection of the person we want Buddha to be .
To approach the real Buddha we have to eliminate ( kill ) these projections .
The other reason for killing Buddha in the road is that by doing so we drop our last crutch and begin walking our spiritual path with full freedom and independence .
In other words , we kill Buddha in the road to attain Buddha - hood ourselves .
By killing Buddha we honor Buddha and ironically give him life .
This teaching actually finds great resonance in the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John .
In the Gospel narratives , the disciples insist on seeing Jesus of Nazareth only through the prism of their own psychological projections , expecting him to assume the crown of an earthly king , all the while refusing to truly honor Jesus by accepting the kingdom of heaven within , where Christ reigns eternally .
So , today , let the Progressive Christian be the Zen Christian :
If you meet Jesus on the road , kill him .
Where you want this killin’ done ?

According to reports , Washington state surveillance firm Veratect Corp. raised the first warning about a possible swine flu outbreak in Mexico more than two weeks before the World Health Organization ( WHO ) made its own announcement .
( Source : pnwlocalnews.com )
It also appears as that federal and international health officials had access to the Veratect Corp. warning .
Emails relating to the possible outbreak spreading in Mexico were sent to 10 officials of the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) and prevention .
It 's not known why health officials did n't act sooner than they did .
Data Mining Technique Detected Outbreak
Kirkland , Washington - based Veratect uses a data mining technique to automatically search tens of thousands of web sites daily for early signs of looming medical problems or civil unrest anywhere in the world .
When items of interest are found , the results are turned over to a team of 35 analysts who post legitimate threats on the company 's web site .
Government agencies , businesses and other groups have access to the Veratect web site .
Veratect has been unsuccessful in trying to sell its services to the CDC , the WHO and the Department of Homeland Security , though the CDC and the WHO were given access to the Veratect web site on a trial basis earlier this year .
Flu Detected Weeks Before WHO 's Announcement
18 days before WHO issued the alert about a possible Swine flu pandemic , Veratect reported on a strange outbreak of respiratory disease in La Gloria , Mexico , noting that local residents thought the flu outbreak was related to contamination from pig breeding farms nearby .
( Source : mcclatchydc.com )
The information was available to the CDC as well as many state and local health authorities .
Records show that an epidemiologist at the Pan American Health Organization -- part of the WHO -- viewed the message about the La Gloria outbreak on April 10 and on April 11 .
An automated email was sent to 10 people at the CDC on April 16 to notify them that a disease with an ' unspecified number of atypical pneumonia cases ' was detected at a hospital in Oaxaca .
Data Mining Technique for Detecting Outbreaks Untested
When there was evidence of the outbreak spreading , Veratect 's chief scientist called people he knew at the CDC 's emergency operations center on April 20 to make them aware of what was happening in Mexico .
During that time , the CDC was focusing its attention on possible swine flu events happening in Texas and California .
Apparently the CDC was not aware that the outbreak was spreading in Mexico .
Four days later , WHO made its announcement about the outbreak .
Veratect hopes to be part of an effective global health monitoring system that is badly needed .
The use of data mining to track possible disease outbreaks is , however , currently unfounded .

Pakistan says there is an " urgent need for a comprehensive response " Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has appealed for urgent cash aid to help up to two million people who have fled fighting with the Taliban .
Addressing international donors in Islamabad , Mr Gilani warned the mass exodus had " grave repercussions " .
The UN says that about 1.5 million people have been displaced since the army 's latest offensive began on 2 May , and two million since last August .
The donors have so far responded with pledges of $ 224 m , officials said .
See a map of the region
The fighting continues , with at least seven people killed in Lower Dir. ' Concrete and visible '
" Given the magnitude of the task that lies ahead , the government of Pakistan would like to seek the support from the donor community , both for the ongoing relief efforts and for the rebuilding process , " the prime minister said .
We have to win the hearts and minds of the people
Yusuf Raza Gilani
Tide turns against the Taliban Inside the war zone Eyewitnesses in Swat " There is an urgent need for a joint and comprehensive response to this issue by all those who are committed to fighting terrorism .
We need to do something concrete and visible . "
Mr Gilani said that a special prime minister 's fund had been established for the internally displaced and called for domestic and international donations .
The US has praised Pakistan 's latest efforts to fight what some in Washington have described as an " existential threat " to the country caused by the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
International donors have pledged $ 224 m for the relief and rehabilitation of those displaced in North West Frontier Province , $ 110 m from the US .
Pakistan has immediately allocated $ 25 m to the NWFP government for relief efforts , but critics warn that is not enough to provide adequate reconstruction and law enforcement .
Ministers say the UN will launch an urgent appeal on Friday in a bid to raise further money .
Correspondents say that as the conflict ploughs on , concerns are mounting about how to cope with the huge number of displaced people , uprooted in what human rights groups have described as Pakistan 's largest movement of people since partition from India in 1947 .
A senior US military official based in Islamabad said the crisis could last until December because the authorities expected large numbers of displaced people to remain in temporary camps until the end of the year .
Explosive device
In the latest fighting , at least seven people have been killed in two separate incidents in in the district of Lower Dir , officials say .
Four militants and three security personnel , including an army officer , died .
The first incident took place in a mountainous part of the Shahi Koto area , when a security force convoy was hit by an improvised explosive device on the main road .
" Three people were killed in the attack , " a local official in Dir told the BBC .
" Two more were injured and one of them is in critical condition . "
The army says that it is gaining the upper hand in Buner
The second incident involved clashes between militants and security forces in the Qambar area .
The incidents took place two days after security forces claimed to have taken complete control of Dir district .
In Swat , the army says that about 15,000 members of the security forces are fighting between 4,000 and 5,000 militants .
It says more than 1,000 militants and more than 50 soldiers have been killed .
There has been no independent confirmation of the casualties - communications with the few remaining local people still in Swat have been seriously disrupted .
The army say that after clearing Taliban strongholds and supply depots in Swat 's mountains , soldiers are battling militants in towns where many thousands of civilians are believed to be hiding .
The army is also conducting a big offensive against Taliban militants in Buner .
Meanwhile US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was " encouraged " by the army 's offensive .
Appearing before a Congressional committee on Wednesday she said that the Pakistani government was taking more positive action than previously and its action was backed by opposition parties .
" If you look at the political support today , the statements that are being made by the prime minister and others in support of the military 's action against the Taliban - we 've never seen anything quite like this before .
" That does not guarantee the outcome , but it certainly is , to some extent , reassuring that the government and opposition are now united in their recognition of the threat posed by extremism . "

There are many unlikely animal pairings in the world , but some of the most uncanny ones involve birds .
Wait , what ?
Those flighty animals the flit about and flee at the slightest sign of trouble ?
Precisely those .
They have been known to climb in and clean the teeth of a crocodile , lounge on the backs of buffalo , moose , hippos , elephants and zebras and even to share a residence with ants – their natural prey .
The first set of symbiotic wonders focused mainly on underwater matches – this set focuses on fliers of the friendly skies .
Plovers and Crocodiles
It looks like something out of a storybook – and in fact it can be traced back to accounts told thousands of years ago – a crocodile opens its mouth , invites a bird in before … what ?
:: Chomp : : it swallows the sap alive ?
Amazingly , the crocodile remains still while the plover picks meat from its mouth .
This cleans the crocodile ’s teeth and prevents infection while providing a somewhat scary meal for the hungry bird .
Honeyguides and Ratels
The honeyguide bird has something of a problem : it wants access to the juicy wax insides of a honeybee nest but lacks the ability to access it directly .
It has learned , however , to lead other predators to such nests and then wait for the remains of the spoils .
The honey badger ( or ratel , shown above ) is one such creature with which the bird works in collaboration , but honeyguides have also been known to lead humans to find nests .
One native population finds honey three times faster because of these incredible birds .
Egrets and … Everything Else

Egrets are strangely equal - opportunity symbiotics – they will ride on the backs of all kinds of large mammals , picking parasites from their fur or skin to nourish themselves , which , in turn , frees these animals of their burden – often kicked up to their backs while walking .
Moreover , it is suspected that egrets also are more sensitive to changes in their surroundings and vigilant than their steeds , making them good at early warnings when it comes to environmental predators or other dangers .
Oxpeckers and Zebras

Oxpeckers , like egrets , free their furry companions of lice , ticks and other annoyances but of particular importance is their flying scream when predators approach – after all , zebras are more susceptible than many large mammal species ( such as elephants and hippos shown above ) to potential aggressors .
However , their actions are not always completely in the interests of their hosts : they are suspected to sometimes nip open wounds on a zebra ’s back in order to encourage more parasites to take root for later meals .
Ostriches and Zebras

Oxpeckers are n’t the only birds that zebras have been known to pair with – they also are often found in the company of giant flightless ostriches .
Both of these species is justifiably concerned with approaching danger .
Unfortunately , the ostrich has terrible senses of smell and hearing and the zebra has poor eyesight .
Fortunately , the zebra can smell or hear certain dangers approaching while the ostrich can see others .
Both are prepared to warn one another at a moment ’s notice so they can each flee as needed .
Woodpecker and Tree Ants

No one knows for certain how the arrangement works , but a certain species of woodpecker and tree ant are known to call temporary truces despite being mortal enemies most of the time .
The southern rufous woodbecker and the black tree ant are normally predator and prey – but when the bird lays its eggs in the nest of the ants an agreement is made , a non-aggression pact of sorts , that protects the bird ’s eggs from attacks by the nest and the ants ’ nest from other birds while the chosen bird is nesting there .
Meat Ants and Leafhoppers
( Images via : Wikipedia , Geocities and BrisbaneInsects )
Other forms of ants , including meat ants , have been known to team up with other species as well , including butterflies and leafhoppers .
Normally , meat ants are vicious and territorial – feeding on dead animals and forcing other species of ants to stay out of their way and forage at night .
However , they make special exceptions for certain other creatures of the trees and skies that secrete substances they can feed on – not only do they leave these partners alive but they actually actively protect them from predators as well .
The Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill to broadly expand national community service programs , increasing the number of positions to 250,000 from 75,000 and creating new cadres of volunteers focused on education , clean energy , health care , and veterans .
In addition to adding positions to the 75,000 existing AmeriCorps slots , the bill would create four new service corps , specializing in areas that largely align with President Obama ’s early agenda .
The Senate measure will now be sent to the House , which approved a different version of the legislation last week .
Officials said they expected the House to adopt the measure next week and send it on to President Obama , a huge proponent of community service programs , who will sign into law .
“ The American habits of the heart are shining through , ” declared Senator Barbara A. Mikulski , Democrat of Maryland , who helped shepherd the bill to final passage .
“ All across America , people want to volunteer if they have the opportunity to do so . ”

How AmeriCorps Became Bipartisan
A half million people have served through AmeriCorps now - a voting constituency - and every member of Congress has shaken their hands and heard their stories of how they ’ve worked in schools , nursing homes , crime - ridden neighborhoods to help communities .
More important , lawmakers have met with the heads of the local non profit groups that run the AmeriCorps programs , often popular and influential leaders in any congressional district .
Advocates for AmeriCorps now include not just national service fetishists like myself ( wrote a book on the subject ) but the entire non-profit and charitable sector .
AmeriCorps members , you see , do n’t work for the government .
The feds offer the money for a small stipend and scholarship but most of the corps members are recruited and managed by non-profits .
For charities , AmeriCorps has become a valuable form of in kind subsidy .
Indeed , it ’s often a way to increase a charity ’s ability to use unpaid volunteers - a key reason it ’s won over hardcore conservative like Hatch .
“ National service programs [ have ] a multiplying effect , ” he declared during the debate .
Based on past patterns , the 250,000 AmeriCorps members will help recruit or manage seven million unpaid volunteers .
“ This is a conservative program in many respects , ” Hatch said .

Are Taxpayers Bailing Out Troubled Banks Twice ?
Bank Practices Inflame Good Customers , Irk Government
The federal government is taking up the fight against credit card companies accused of taking advantage of consumers .
In taking aim at what he called " abuse that goes unpunished , " President Obama has asked Congress to send him a bill by Memorial Day that prevents credit card companies from suddenly raising rates on everyday customers .
" Americans know they have a responsibility to live within their means and pay what they owe , " Obama said .
" But they also have a right to not get ripped off by sudden rate hikes , unfair penalties and hidden fees . "
Congress is moving swiftly to comply with the president 's request .
A credit card holder 's Bill of Rights has already passed the House .
The bill would prohibit retroactive rate increases , prevent companies from issuing cards to anyone under 18 and eliminate what 's called " double - cycle billing . "
Double - cycle billing is a little known calculation used by many companies .
The company looks at your current monthly balance , as well as your previous months ' spending , and averages them both , charging you a higher interest rate .
Although the practice is considered deceptive , credit card holders often consent to it when they sign a contract .
" Most of these credit card companies have a little clause left somewhere in the back on page 28 in language that says , 'we can charge you any amount we want , at any time we want , for no reason at all , ' " said Elizabeth Warren , a law professor at Harvard .
Warren chairs the Congressional Oversight Panel , an independent agency that tracks the hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars already being used to help the banks survive .
On the heels of this week 's stress tests , which showed 10 of the nation 's 19 largest banks will need a further injection of cash to survive , she said it 's no secret where the banks will get the money .
" We 've seen a sharp rise in interest rates in the last few months on good customers who are paying .
It 's coming from banks taking taxpayer dollars . "
Warren said .
In essence , that means the banks will raise rates on taxpayers who helped them out in the first place .
One of those taxpayers , Mindy Busch , graduated from college today .
She and her husband , Michael , are now expecting a baby .
What they were not expecting were the rate hikes on the credit cards they pay faithfully .
Bank of America raised their interest rate from 20 percent to 32 percent .
" It 's just not fair , " Busch said .
" We pay every month , and this is a bank that is benefitting already from our taxpayer dollars . "
Bank of America told ABC
News they could not comment on an individual 's account .
As far as rates go , the bank said , " Any hikes reflect the current economic conditions .
Our costs of providing credit have significantly increased . "

See the virtual body parts
Doctors could soon be testing medications or surgery on your virtual twin before you get to undergo the real treatment .
Researchers around the world are creating different personalised simulations of living body parts , so that bespoke therapies can be tested and optimised without risk to the patient .
A virtual model developed by a team at Université Libre de Bruxelles replicates a person ’s gait and is about to be trialled in clinics as a way of analysing the effects of conditions such as cerebral palsy .
Elsewhere , computer scientists at University College London have created bespoke simulations of blood flowing through a brain aneurism , while researchers at the University of Oxford have modelled changing blood flow through the heart as it contracts .
Such models could be used to test how drugs affect , say , how blood flows through the affected area .
Models of individual body parts could eventually be integrated to simulate a patient ’s entire body ( see our feature : Virtual twins could bring the end of animal research ) .

The New York Times reported today that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) " had been engaged in ' over - collection ' of domestic communications of Americans , " by which the NSA would spy on " groups of Americans and collect their domestic communications without proper court authority . "
According to the Times , a review conducted over the course of the Presidential transition revealed " that the N.S.A. was improperly capturing information involving significant amounts of American traffic . "
The Times also reported new information on " earlier domestic surveillance activities , including the agency ’s attempt to wiretap a congressman without court approval on an overseas trip . "
In addition , " a senior F.B.I. agent recently came forward with what the inspector general ’s office described as allegations of ' significant misconduct ' in the surveillance program ...
Those allegations are said to involve the question of whether the N.S.A. targeted Americans in eavesdropping operations based on insufficient evidence tying them to terrorism . "
EFF is litigating against both the telecoms and the government in an effort to stop the illegal spying on millions of ordinary Americans .
Take action now !
As many as 300,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans may have suffered from PTSD or depression at some point , and the military has already spent millions on treatment for returning troops - everything from " samurai meditation " to at - home computerized counselors .
Now the Pentagon 's advanced research arm is hoping that a combination of neuroscience , psychology , and creative pill - popping can stop battlefield stress before it even starts .
Darpa is hosting a one - day information session to solicit proposals for “ Enabling Stress Resistance ” among troops .
They ’re hoping to harness advances in molecular biology ( the science of cell - to - cell interaction ) and neuroscience that would short - circuit the brain ’s stress response .
Using animals as test subjects , Darpa first wants a precise understanding of how stress targets and damages the brain .
Recent technological developments in neuroscience present the opportunity for these challenges to be addressed as never before .
Cutting edge molecular biological techniques coupled with in - vivo measurement technologies may allow for manipulation of the stress pathways and behavioral analysis in real - time .
These powerful tools allow assessment of the effects of stress with extreme temporal and anatomical precision .
The program ’s ultimate goal is quick - fix stress mitigation , using " cognitive , behavioral or pharmacological interventions that will prevent the deleterious effects of stress on the brain . ”
We 've already heard talk of pills to boost soldier bravado , so stress – from occupational to emotional – could be the next target for tactical pharmacology .
The intervention would prevent on - the - spot anxiety , but Darpa ’s hoping it can also thwart post - traumatic symptoms , like “ cognitive dysfunction and insomnia . ”
Targeting the cerebral root of stress would transform mental health beyond the military , but the project is still in its infancy .
Before research can start , Darpa plans to assemble a dream team , including experts and researchers in “ industry , small business and academia ” to tackle the initiative .

Advertisement A police officer thought to be shown on video pushing a man at the G20 protests in London who later died is to be questioned by the police watchdog .
An independent criminal probe has begun into the death of Ian Tomlinson , 47 , who had a heart attack minutes after the incident on 1 April .
More video aired on Channel 4 appears to show him being hit with a baton .
The Metropolitan Police ( Met ) has now acknowledged Mr Tomlinson came " into contact with police " before he died .
Initially the force said it was unaware he had sustained the alleged assault and said its officers ' first contact with him was when they gave him medical aid before he died .
" It is now clear that Mr Tomlinson did come into contact with police prior to his death and that a number of the officers depicted in the footage on a national newspaper 's website have identified themselves as MPS officers , " it said in a statement .
Scotland Yard said the officer seen on Channel 4 footage was one of four who had come forward to give information .
The IPCC has ordered a second post - mortem test as part of its inquiry .
See a map of the scene Mr Tomlinson 's stepson Paul King said the footage has " deeply touched " the family and said " we can not lay our father to rest " until they get justice .
The IPCC began its investigation before footage surfaced of Mr Tomlinson being shoved .
Ian Tomlinson lived and worked in the City of London
The watchdog said it would examine the footage and discuss it with the Crown Prosecution Service .
Following Mr Tomlinson 's death , the IPCC initially said it would oversee an investigation into the incident to be carried out by the City of London police .
Deborah Glass , of the IPCC , explained the decision to take over the inquiry : " People are rightly concerned about this tragic death and this footage is clearly disturbing .
" In light of new information which we became aware of yesterday [ Tuesday ] evening , we have now taken the decision to independently investigate . "
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said no officers had been suspended .
He added : " A total of four officers , inclusive of this officer , have now come forward with potentially relevant information in relation to the investigation into the death of Mr Tomlinson . "
The video , shot at 1929 BST at the Royal Exchange Passage , appears to show newspaper vendor Mr Tomlinson , who was going home from work and not protesting , walking away from a group of police officers .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The footage , recorded by a New York fund manager , appears to show Mr Tomlinson landing heavily after being pushed by an officer .
Minutes later , Mr Tomlinson collapsed and died of a heart attack , after walking about 50 yards to nearby Cornhill where he received first aid from police .
The Guardian newspaper obtained the video and has handed it to the IPCC .
And new footage , taken by a Channel 4 News cameraman , shows an officer apparently hitting him left - handed with a baton , then shoving him to the ground .
The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the images raised " obvious concerns " and pledged full support from the force .

hen implementing a sequence of elements that needs to grow and shrink dynamically , is a fine choice .
It provides the convenience of a standard container class , including automatic memory management , random access to elements , a uniform interface , and compatibility with standard algorithms .
However , for a sequence whose size is fixed , the performance hit that comes with all that convenience is n't always justifiable .
In particular , a vector incurs the following overhead :
Nontrivial initialization and destruction .
The constructor and destructor of std::vector are relatively costly .
This overhead is particularly noticeable when your program creates a large number of vectors .
are relatively costly .
This overhead is particularly noticeable when your program creates a large number of vectors .
Allocation time .
Vectors allocate storage for their elements at runtime .
Space overhead .
A vector object typically occupies 32 bytes .
Built - in arrays carry none of this overhead .
They allocate their storage statically and have zero space overhead .
So why not just use built - in arrays instead for your fixed - sized sequences ?
Built - in arrays have their own downside :
Their security loopholes make them an insecure choice .
Luckily , the C++ Standard Library offers a container - like template called std :: array , which offers a secure , efficient , and convenient alternative to built - in arrays without the overhead of vectors .
This 10 - Minute Solution shows how to use this powerful alternative for fixed - sized sequences .
How can I implement fixed - sized sequences without the security loopholes of built - in arrays or the noticeable overhead of vectors ?
Use std:array as a secure , efficient , and convenient alternative to built - in arrays and vectors for your fixed - sized sequences .
" Hank Paulson is a national hero .
I said it last October and I 'm sticking by it .
And now , there 's actual evidence to back me up .
The TARP bailout worked .
The Wall Street crisis is over . " -- Evan Newmark , " It 's Time to Enshrine Hank Paulson as National Hero , " Wall Street Journal .
So here 's the letter I wrote to the Wall Street Journal after reading Evan Newmark 's paean to Hank Paulson last week :
Dear WSJ , Just out of curiosity -- did Evan Newmark ever work for Goldman , Sachs ?
And if the answer to the question is yes , do n't you think that might have been a good fact to disclose before he fellated Hank Paulson in his " Mean Street " column ?
Sincerely ,
Matt Taibbi
Can you imagine what a craven , bumlicking ass - goblin you 'd have to be to get a job working for the Wall Street Journal , not mention up front that you used to be a Goldman , Sachs managing director , and then write a lengthy article calling your former boss a " national hero " -- in the middle of a sweeping financial crisis , one in which half the world is in a panic and the unemployment rate just hit a 25 - year high ?
Behavior like this , you usually do n't see it outside prison trusties who spend their evenings shining the guards ' boots .
I can't even think of a political press secretary who would sink that low .
Hank Paulson , a hero ?
Are you fucking kidding us ?
Exactly what part of Paulson 's record is heroic , Evan ?
The part where he called up SEC director William Donaldson in 2004 and quietly arranged to get the state to drop capital requirements for the country 's top five investment banks ?
You remember that business , right , Evan ?
Your hero Paulson met with Donaldson and got the rules changed so that Goldman and four other banks no longer had to abide by the old restrictions that forced banks to actually have a dollar or two on hand for every ten or so they lent out .
After that , it was party time !
Bear Stearns in just a few years had a debt - to - equity ration of 33 - 1 !
Lehman 's went to 32 - 1 .
By an amazing coincidence , both of these companies exploded just a few years after that meeting , and all of the rest of us , Evan , ended up footing the bill , thanks to a state - sponsored rescue of Bear and a much larger massive bailout of Wall Street in general , necessitated in large part by the damage caused by the chaos surrounding Lehman 's collapse .
Meanwhile your own Goldman , Sachs ended up with a 22:1 debt - to - equity ratio a few years following that meeting , a number that would have been much higher if one did n't count the hedges Goldman bought through a company called AIG .
Thanks in large part to Paulson 's leadership in his last years as head of Goldman , the company was so massively over - leveraged that it would have gone under if AIG -- which owed Goldman billions when it went into its death spiral last September -- had been allowed to collapse .
But thanks to Hank Paulson , who heroically stepped in and gave AIG $ 80 billion the same weekend he allowed one of Goldman 's last key competitors , Lehman , to collapse , Goldman did n't have to go without that money ; $ 13 billion of the AIG bailout went straight to Goldman .
So I guess we have Paulson to thank for the fact that he used about $ 13 billion of our taxpayer money to essentially bail out his own fuckups .
I mean , that 's heroism if I 've ever seen it .
Audie Murphy has nothing on that .
Sit your asses back down , Harriet Tubman , Thomas More , Gandhi and Jesus Christ .
Hank Paulson is in the house !
Or maybe it was Paulson 's foresight in heading off the crisis before it happened that inspired you ?
Maybe it was the way Paulson pronounced the subprime fallout " contained " in 2007 and called the economy the " strongest in decades ? "
Or maybe it was the way he remained calm last July , saying that it was a " very manageable situation " and " our regulators are on top of it ? "
Remember how he said all that shit , Evan , just about six weeks before the world exploded ?
Remember that Henry Paulson was actually in charge of regulating the financial environment during the last years of the crisis and did nothing as his buddies on Wall Street built one gigantic mountain of leverage after another , gashing underwriting standards across the board , saddling the country with a generation of toxic assets that all of the rest of us will be paying for in taxes ( instead of , for instance , a health care program , which we can now no longer afford ) for the next fifty fucking years ?
Do you remember that part ?
Or was it his non-intervention last summer when gas prices hit $ 4.50 a gallon thanks again to his old buddies at Goldman and Morgan Stanley , who juiced the commodities market with so much speculative cash that oil prices soared despite the fact that supply was up and demand was down all year ?
Do you remember that part ?
How about the way food prices soared thanks to the same commodities speculators ?
According to the World Food Program at the UN , about 100 million people joined the ranks of the hungry last year during the commodities spike .
Or maybe it was the way the Treasury Department refused to tell the Congress really anything at all about how it chose whom to give TARP money to ; how when the Congressional Oversight Panel asked Paulson what criteria he was using to decide who gets bailout money and who does n't , he sent Congress back a copy of a TARP application form .
Maybe it was that .
Or maybe it was the way Paulson got a $ 200 million tax deferral thanks to an obscure rule that allows executives who join the government to defer taxes on their holdings .
That means that not only did Paulson use billions of our money to bail out his own mistakes , he managed to use a loophole to get out of paying his fair share of that same bailout .
Even if it were n't about five years too early to make any kind of judgment at all about whether or not TARP helped , the notion that Henry Paulson is a hero is complete and utter madness because TARP would never have been necessary if someone , anyone who was n't a greed - addled incompetent like Paulson had actually been regulating the economy in the last years of the Bush adminstration .
If anyone besides Paulson had been running Goldman Sachs earlier in this decade -- if a person with a serious brain injury had been in his place , for instance , or a horse , or a head of lettuce -- we'd all be better off today , because there would n't be so many toxic Goldman - underwritten mortgage - backed CDOs on the market .
We , all of us , are paying the freight for assholes like Paulson , and like you , for that matter .
And while we 're getting over it , slowly , you 're really not helping when you open your mouth and pat yourself on the back for all the good deeds you 've done .
Spare , us , okay ?
Just give it up .

A Kenyan man bit a python who wrapped him in its coils and hauled him up a tree in a struggle that lasted hours , local media said Wednesday .
Farm manager Ben Nyaumbe was working at the weekend when the serpent , apparently hunting for livestock , struck in the Malindi area of Kenya ’s Indian Ocean coast .
“ I stepped on a spongy thing on the ground and suddenly my leg was entangled with the body of a huge python , ” he told the Daily Nation newspaper .
When the snake coiled itself round his upper body , Nyaumbe resorted to desperate measures : “ I had to bite it . ”
The python dragged him up a tree , but when it eased its grip , Nyaumbe said he was able to take a mobile phone out of his pocket and phone for help .
When his supervisor came with a policeman , Nyaumbe smothered the snake ’s head with his shirt , while the rescuers tied it with a rope and pulled .
“ We both came down , landing with a thud , ” said Nyaumbe , who survived with damaged lips and bruising .
The snake escaped from the three sacks it was bundled into .
Selecting a game engine used to be a snap when there was only a handful from which to choose .
But today , developers have a plethora of possibilities -- from rolling their own to licensing an engine originally built for a specific game ( like the Unreal Engine ) to licensing a generic engine ( like Emergent 's Gamebryo ) .
To add to the confusion , says San Francisco - based independent games consultant Mark DeLoura , during the past few months the number of game engines available has suddenly increased from a relative few to something that needs a spreadsheet to keep track of .
Which is why , in February , he sent out a survey to industry executives asking for their feedback on the use of game engines .
Last month , he shared some of his results on his Gamasutra blog .
Faced with such a grand buffet of choices , how do successful developers make their selections ?
Alex Seropian considers himself " engine agnostic , " having had all three experiences -- first , creating the Halo Engine at Bungie , then -- at Wideload -- using the Unreal Engine for a very un -" Unreal " - like Hail To The Chimp , and , finally , employing the Gamebryo Engine for the soon - to - be released Texas Cheat ' Em. Seropian is president and founder of Chicago - based Wideload Games .
But what was there about each project that influenced him to make the decisions that he did ?
Choosing to create an engine -- the Halo Engine -- for Halo back in 1991 was a no- brainer , recalls Seropian .
" Eighteen years ago you really did n't have many choices , " he says .
" Besides , the team at Bungie wanted to build Halo around some very particular technology features and core mechanics , and that necessitated our constructing our own game engine . "
The project -- building both the engine and the first Halo game -- took almost nine years until the Xbox platform was released in 2001 .
" It 's a long , long process , " says Seropian , " and things have changed since then .
Teams are bigger , projects are more expensive , and anyone who , today , wonders ' Hey , should I start up a game project from absolutely nothing and write every piece of code from scratch ? ' needs to know what a very big , daunting , multi- year investment it is . "
Indeed , exactly a year ago , Wideload released Cyclomite , one of its " Shorts " ( or casual ) games using the Torque Engine which it licensed .
But first Wideload prototyped the game by writing its own 2D sprite engine .
" Even that took us four months to build , " notes Seropian .
" But if we had wanted to write a 3D engine that was going to be competitive on a next - gen console , that would have taken many , many years .
To start making an engine today that 's going to compete with Halo 3 or Gears of War , that 's a four - year investment . "
" If you 've got a large enough team that 's really funded well or if you have a specific feature in mind that you 're looking to exploit , then that 's practical .
For an independent developer like me , that 's definitely not practical . "
Gamecock / Wideload 's Hail to the Chimp
And so , for Wideload 's Hail To The Chimp -- a party game comprised of a collection of mini-games -- Seropian looked at five different engines , but turned to the Unreal Engine 3 for several reasons .
" First , we license engines in general because we are a small , 25 - person company and we want to stay that way , " explains Seropian .
" Second , we were building Chimp for both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 , and the Unreal Engine targets both those platforms . "
" And the third and most important reason was that the Unreal 3 offered all the systems that we needed -- one for save games , one for networking , one for the interface we were building , and so on .
Basically , for us , it was a soup - to - nuts solution . "
Notes : Three Philosophers is a unique blend of a Belgian - style dark ale and Liefmans Kriek , an authentic cherry ale from Belgium .
Cherry chestnut in color , it 's opaque but not cloudy with full carbonation topped by a smooth , tan head .
Flavors and aromas of roasted malt , molasses and brown sugar , dark fruits , brandied raisins and chocolate , Three Philosophers has notable sweetness with low hop bitterness .
The mid-palate shows a soft malt center which gives way to a dry , warm , wine - like finish .
The complexity of this beer make it a good candidate for ageing gracefully , as spicy sherry and port notes should intensify .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea ’s government and the family of former President Roh Moo-hyun agreed on Sunday to hold a public funeral for the leader who likely jumped to his death after being hounded for weeks in a widening corruption scandal .
Roh , 62 , whose single five - year term as president ended about 15 months ago , appears to have leapt from a cliff behind his rural home on Saturday morning .
He wrote in a note before his death : “ Do n’t blame anybody .
Please cremate me .
And please leave a small tombstone near home . ”
Local police said the results of a provisional investigation indicate the death was suicide .
“ It is more desirable to send the former president off in an honorable and courteous way befitting a former president and to allow as many people as possible to pay reverence and praise him , ” Cheon Ho-seon , a spokesman for Roh when he was president , said in a statement .
Local media said the government and family were looking to hold the funeral on Friday for Roh , a self - taught lawyer who rose from rural poverty and won the presidency backed by a generation of students who hit the streets to fight for democracy in the 1980s .
Perhaps
Roh ’s most celebrated moment came when he went to Pyongyang in 2007 for a summit with Kim Jong - il in what was only the second meeting of leaders of the divided peninsula .
North Korea reported on Roh ’s death on Sunday , saying in a two - sentence dispatch : “ Media at home and abroad are linking the motive of his death with the mental burden caused by the intensive investigation of the prosecution . ”
Roh was questioned last month by prosecutors on suspicion that his family took about $ 6 million in bribes from a shoe company CEO , which tarnished a reputation he tried to nurture of being a reformer who wanted to clean up government .
The South Korean public largely saw Roh as an ineffective leader whose government was marred by numerous missteps and overwhelmingly voted to replace him with a conservative businessman who pledged to undo Roh ’s economic policies .

The likelihood of suicide could boost sympathy for opponents of his successor President Lee Myung - bak , whose hardline policies have largely overturned the more accommodating approach of Roh in dealings with North Korea and strike - prone labor unions .
Mourners in Seoul paid respects to Roh at the weekend while tearful residents of his southeast Bongha Village hometown lined the streets when a coffin carrying Roh ’s body arrived back from hospital on Saturday .

It took scientists a decade to sequence the complete genome Scientists have finished sequencing the mouse genome after a 10 - year effort .
The humble mouse is the experimental workhorse in laboratories worldwide , so this high - quality genome sequence will aid in the fight against human disease .
The search for novel treatments could benefit from a greater understanding of the mouse genetic code , which is about 75 % similar to our own .
An international team of researchers have published details of the work in the open- access journal PLoS Biology .
The sequence comprises the full complement of genetic material in the nucleus of a cell .
It is effectively the genetic " instruction booklet " for a living animal .
The mouse ( Mus musculus ) becomes only the second mammal after humans to have its complete genome laid bare .
But draft sequences have been published for the chimp , dog , rat , cat , macaque and even the duck - billed platypus
The mouse is the animal most often used to better understand human illnesses and how they develop .
Research carried out using mice has led to advances in the treatment of cancer , diabetes , heart disease and countless other conditions .
Good model Co-author Professor Chris Ponting , from the University of Oxford , told BBC News the work confirmed that the mouse was an excellent experimental model for human disease .

More from Today programme " Completion of the genome is extremely important in helping us to identify the genes that underpin biology that is the same across all mammals , " he said .
But he said it was also important to separate the genes humans shared with mice from those which differed between them .
About 75 % of mouse genes have a single equivalent in humans .
But some 5,000 genes arose after the ancestors of mice and humans went their separate evolutionary ways .
" In retrospect , our previous picture of the mouse genome was incomplete , " said Dr Leo Goodstadt from the University of Oxford .
" Only when all the missing pieces of the genomic puzzle had been filled in did we realise that we had been missing large numbers of genes found only in mice , and not in humans . "
The mouse genome sequencing effort began in 1999 , and a draft sequence was published in 2002 .
The cost , borne by US and UK sequencing centres , is estimated to exceed $ 100 m ( £ 62 m ) .
Some groups oppose animal experimentation , campaigning to ban or limit the animals used .
In the UK , growth in the use of genetically modified ( GM ) animals - mainly mice - is largely responsible for a steady rise in the numbers of animals used in experiments since 1997 .
Professor Ponting , from the Medical Research Council 's ( MRC ) Functional Genomics Unit at Oxford , said the complete genome could provide insights into the evolution of mammals .
Humans and mice share a remarkable level of similarity , despite having evolved independently for the last 90 million years .

Russia 's navy has been plagued by a series of accidents since 1991
A Russian warship has mistakenly shelled a village near the northern city of St Petersburg , officials say .
They say the small anti-submarine vessel fired up to 15 artillery rounds at Pesochnoye during target practice late on Thursday .
No injuries were reported in the village .
It was not immediately clear how much property damage there was .
Some terrified villagers said they thought a war had started , Russia 's Ria Novosti news agency reports .
Russia 's navy has been plagued by a series of accidents since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , including the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000 that left more than 100 sailors dead .
Lenders are completely in control of the pricing in many markets around California and the rest of the Country , and they control the lowest tier of the market here in Irvine .
What will they do with their power ?
Asking Price : $ 263,500
Address : 244 Lemon Grove , Irvine , CA 92618
{book7}
Bonus question : Would you buy on a freeway ?
I Wanna Rule the World — 10CC
I wanna be a boss
I wanna be a big boss
I wanna boss the world around
I wanna be the biggest boss
that ever bossed the world around
Lenders will be the bosses of the Irvine market because they will control the majority of for - sale property in the market .
They already control many markets where REOs make up more than 50 % of all sales .
They completely control the bottom market strata here in Irvine , and as foreclosures work their way up the property ladder , they will end up controlling our entire real estate market .
A couple of weeks ago , I wrote about Irvine ’s Future REO Inventory .
In that post , I noted the following :
Foreclosure is a four step process : ( 1 ) the borrower quits making
payments , ( 2 ) the lender issues of Notice of Default , ( 3 ) the lender
issues a notice of Trustee Sale , and ( 4 ) the foreclosure auction occurs
on the courthouse steps .
Steps 1 , 2 and 3 are separated by 90 days
each .
At any time during this period , either the borrower can get
current with their payments , or the borrower and lender can agree to a
loan modification .
If either contingency occurs , the foreclosure
process is aborted .
California passed SB1137 to force lenders to try harder to reach
borrowers in default and work out a loan modification plan .
Also , the
GSEs and many large banks were on voluntary or mandated foreclosure
moratoria .
This caused a dramatic decline in Notices of Default ( step
2 ) . Unfortunately , as I noted Moritorium on Defaults Announced ,
stopping lenders from issuing notices does nothing to prevent borrowers
from actually defaulting ( step 1 ) .
Borrowers everywhere stopped making
payments , and lenders merely stopped issuing notices about it .
I borrowed the chart below from Mish ’s blog showing the delinquency rate since January of 2006 ( # 1 above — people who quit making payments ) .
As you can see , there has been a steady increase in the delinquency rate .
This is the first step in the foreclosure process .
Unless a borrower who goes delinquent cures this delinquency , the property will work its way through the system and ultimately become REO .
In the past , people cured their delinquencies either by selling the property or borrowing the payments from another source .
In today ’s market , they cannot sell because they are underwater , and creditors have cut off other lines of credit ; therefore , the two primary methods of curing default have been removed .
Of course , this assumes that people want to cure their delinquency .
When their is no equity in the property , and when the cost of ownership exceeds the cost of rental , there is little incentive to cure delinquency .
In short , people walk .
Since the primary methods of curing delinquencies have been curtailed , and since the desire to cure is also diminished , the cure rate has dropped to near zero .
Since the cure rate is near zero and likely to stay that way , new delinquencies will end up as foreclosures .
The current delinquency rate is 9.12 % .
That means that over 9 % of all homes with a mortgage are entering the foreclosure pipeline right now .
The rate of delinquency is still getting worse .
In the astute observations last week , Dafox posted a link to Orange County foreclosure data .
One of the charts created from this data is shows the number of NODs and foreclosures with the foreclosure numbers shifted by one year to account for the duration of the foreclosure process .
I have taken the delinquency chart based on national data and guestimated the loan delinquency rate in Orange County based on national trends .
I combined the two data sources into the chart below .
The purpose of the chart is to illustrate the pipelines of inventory currently working its way through the system .
Remember just because a lender has n’t filed a NOD does not mean people are not going delinquent on their payments ; these properties make up the “ Delinquency Inventory . ”
The foreclosure tsunami will continue to build until delinquencies stop rising and actual foreclosures catch up .
There are no “ green shoots ” here .
Another kind of inventory known as “ pipeline inventory ” is the number of properties moving from NOD through to foreclosure .
These properties will become REO unless the loans are cured .
The chart demonstrates that lenders were processing their foreclosures as they were obtaining them through mid 2007 ; there was little delinquency or pipeline inventory .
In late 2007 as the various foreclosure moratoria began , lenders began falling behind on their filing of NODs and their foreclosure processes .
The foreclosure moratoria were supposed to workout
several million loans and stop people from entering the foreclosure
process .
As we all know , this process has been a fiasco .
The number of
loan modifications completed is a very small percentage of the number
of delinquencies , and 70 % of those loan modifications default in 6
months .
Other than buying the banks a little time , the foreclosure
moratoria were a failure .
The delays in foreclosure caused a buildup of properties in the system in the form of delinquency inventory and pipeline inventory .
Unless the delinquencies and defaults are cured during the process –which seems unlikely –these properties will become REO .
As we all know becoming REO is only part of the story .
Once a property becomes REO , it must be disposed of by the bank .
The inventory owned by the bank but not being sold in the open market is known as “ shadow inventory , ” and estimates of this number vary widely .
I cannot find a data source to verify the number , but the rumor is that there are 50,000 + bank owned properties in the five - county area of Southern California .
Add together loan delinquencies , pipeline inventory and shadow inventory , and you have a huge number of homes that will emerge from the system as must - sell inventory .
It will take years for the lenders to catch up on all the loan delinquencies they are facing because they are falling further behind every day .
The result of all this inventory in the hands of lenders is a complete domination of the market by REO .
What will lenders do ?
The fantasy of fence sitters everywhere is that lenders will either by choice or by force will dump large numbers of properties on the market all at one time and create so much must - sell inventory that prices roll back to the stone ages .
I rather doubt 1970s prices are on the horizon .
There will be regulatory pressure on the lenders to dispose of their assets , but an extreme rollback in prices would be so disruptive , that regulators will likely give the lenders some room to work off their inventories without causing a catastrophic collapse of asset values .
So the question is , “ How low will they go ? ”
Lenders are not completely stupid ( kool aid insane perhaps , but not utterly clueless ) .
Most understand cashflow valuations , and they can recognize price levels where it is cheaper for people to own than it is to rent .
Once they cross that threshold , they know they can entice a renter to purchase a property from them because it really is a good deal .
Depending on the desirability for long - term owner occupancy , they may have to increase their discounts in order to find a buyer , but it is n’t very likely that lenders will allow asset values to drop far below rental parity because even they recognize the value there .
IMO , once lenders gain total control of housing markets with the inventory they have , they will push prices down to rental parity and attempt to hold them there .
There will be some pressure from regulators to dispose of assets , but there will be a pushback from lenders who recognize the floor of values rental parity creates .
This tension will keep prices at these levels until the inventory of REO is flushed through the system .
It is hard to estimate how long this flushing process will take without hard numbers .
Based on the current state of our economy , the huge number of bad loans yet to reset , and the general trend illustrated in the charts above , I would estimate we will not see a peak in foreclosures until 2012 , and it will be three to five years after that before the inventory is purged from the system .
It will take a decade to work off the excesses of The Great Housing Bubble .

This property is tracking right on the statutory limits .
Relative to what we have been seeing , this one is on the fast track .
Given the rapid deteioration of low end pricing , it is wise to get this done as quickly as possible .
Pricing of these low end properties are still above cashflow investor levels , so quick foreclosure and sale provides opportunity for the lender to bequeath future depreciation to a knife catcher .

IMO , this is a well executed price drop .
They started high enough to get some of their money back , after an initial look , they began methodically lowering the price , and they did so at an unpredictable interval so potential buyers could not just wait a certain number of days expecting further declines .
Of course , it can be argued that such a large price drop reflects too high a starting asking price .
This is probably an accurate criticism , but with as fast as the low end collapsed , it is hard to say for sure .

This property was a classic “ put ” to the bank .
The owner paid $ 62,500 on 10/29/1997 using a $ 35,000 first mortgage and a $ 27,500 downpayment .
She only borrowed against the property once during the bubble taking out a $ 20,000 loan in late 2003 – that is until 7/23/2007 when she took out a $ 212,000 first mortgage .
Her timing was great because two weeks later the credit crunch hit , and financing these properties became significantly more difficult .

The discount on this property is remarkable : 43 % .
The sad part is that it is still overpriced .
It is probably near rental parity , but this is n’t a property an owner - occupant wants .
This must fall to cashflow investor levels , and it is n’t there yet .
{book4}
Will the Cartel Collapse ?
Implicit in my belief that prices will hold at prices between rental parity and cashflow investor levels is the belief that a variety of lenders holding properties will behave as an informal cartel and hold prices at levels above where supply and demand would find its own equilibrium .
Cartels are inherently unstable because each member has an incentive to cheat .
There is the possibility that the collapse of cartel pricing may push prices even lower .
I doubt this will happen , not because the cartel will be stable , but because I believe cashflow investors will provide sufficient demand to mop up any supply .
I might be wrong .
What do you think the lenders will do ?
Pirate Bay judge Tomas Norström 's objectivity has already been called into doubt because of his ties to national and international pro-copyright lobby groups .
Now , one of the defense lawyers says he has uncovered another scandal and claims to have evidence that Norström was n't assigned to the case randomly , as should be the case according to court procedure .
In recent weeks we have written about the Pirate Bay judge ’s ties to various national and international pro-copyright groups .
Because of his involvement with these groups the lawyers of the defendants have asked for a retrial , and according to some legal experts , they just might have a chance of achieving that .
Meanwhile , the evidence against the judge is stacking up .
Peter Sunde , Pirate Bay ’s spokesperson has pointed out that Norström ’s appointment to the TPB case might be set up .
In Sweden – like in most other countries – a judge is usually appointed to a case randomly .
However , not with the Pirate Bay trial according to defense lawyer Per E Samuelson .
“ We ’ve found some things , particularly about the random selection .
It does n’t seem to have been random , ” Samuelson told SVT .
The chief magistrate of the district court in Stockholm denied this , claiming that the regular selection procedure was carried out .
Tomas Norström addressing the international media after the Pirate bay verdict
Peter Sunde , one of the defendants convicted by the court over which Norström presided , previously told Torrent Freak that he hopes to see a retrial .
“ In the best interest of the Swedish people ’s trust in the system a retrial should be not only granted , but pushed for , ” he said .
Judge Tomas Norström himself refused to comment on the continued allegations .
The defense lawyers have meanwhile filed requests a retrial .

PDF Talk : “ The Not - So - Hidden Politics of Class Online ” Understanding retweeting on Twitter » xkcd meets reality Earlier this week , xkcd posted a fantastic comic about the apocalypse happening and the dead rising to walk the earth .
In the comic , mathematicians scribbled frantically and raced to Paul Erdos ’ grave to get him to sign a document that is presumably co-authorship on a paper .
( For the uninitiated , read about the Erdos number . )
Anyhow , I forwarded this to Henry Cohn – a mathematician friend of mine – who sent me the most hysterical email that I just had to share :
By the way , there ’s no need to wait until the end times to write papers with dead mathematicians .
One example of this is the paper “ Higher algebraic K - theory of schemes and of derived categories ” by R. W. Thomason and Thomas Trobaugh , which Thomason wrote with his deceased friend Trobaugh after Trobaugh appeared to him in a dream : “ The first author must state that his coauthor and close friend , Tom Trobaugh , quite intelligent , singularly original , and inordinately generous , killed himself consequent to endogenous depression .
Ninety - four days later , in my dream , Tom ’s simulacrum remarked , ‘ The direct limit characterization of perfect complexes shows that they extend , just as one extends a coherent sheaf . ’
Awaking with a start , I knew this idea had to be wrong , since some perfect complexes have a non-vanishing K_0 obstruction to extension .
I had worked on this problem for 3 years , and saw this approach to be hopeless .
But Tom ’s simulacrum had been so insistent , I knew he would n’t let me sleep undisturbed until I had worked out the argument and could point to the gap .
This work quickly led to the key results of this paper .
To Tom , I could have explained why he must be listed as a coauthor . ”

Itay and Tal have been together for eight years since the night they met
By Tim Franks
BBC News , Jerusalem
CONTRASTING CITIES
There is an old joke around these parts .
Question : Other than Jerusalem , what do ultra-religious Jews , Muslims and Christians love ?
Answer :
They love to hate homosexuals .
But travel the 60 km ( 40 miles ) from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv , and you enter a world apart .
Major streets are decked with the multi-coloured Gay Pride banner .
Meir Dizengoff is waiting for an annual parade with a difference
In this centenary year of the city , this is now Gay Pride month .
On Friday , in Meir Dizengoff park , tens of thousands of people are expected to attend the annual Gay Pride parade which will end , this year , with a twist .
Four couples will take part in what is being called Israel 's first , public , gay wedding ceremony .
Tal Dekel and Itay Gourevitch , are sitting , wedged happily next to each other , on a park bench .
Tal is a fashion designer , Itay a website editor .
Both are 33 .
They have been together for eight years , since the night they met in a club .
Two weeks ago , they decided to get married .
" It 's a chance to have our own rights : to have a quiet corner with our family , just like everyone else , " says Tal .
Itay says that things have improved for gay and lesbian Israelis .
He can now , at least in Tel Aviv , walk down the street , arm in arm with his partner .
" Fifteen years ago , I would have been beaten up . "
But there is still discrimination , he says .
" As a gay couple , we can't get a loan to buy a house together .
We do n't have the right to adopt a child : we 'd have to go abroad to do that .
But we have all the obligations : we have to pay all the taxes . "
BIBLICAL BAN
The idea of the " weddings " was Yaniv Weizmann's .
He has a unique position in Israeli local government .
He is the advisor to the mayor of Tel Aviv on gay affairs , as well as tourism .
Mr Weizmann says that he wanted to draw attention to the fact that Israel 's gay community ( which he estimates is one in 10 of the population ) is growing older , and so cares now about getting married and starting a family .
If a man wants to marry his sister , would that be OK ?
Would it be alright if , tomorrow , he wanted to marry his mother ?
Binyamin Babayoff
The weddings will , he predicts , be " very beautiful and very , very emotional " .
They will have all the Jewish trimmings : a canopy , a glass to break , a certificate .
But he also is aware of the limitations .
State - recognised non-religious marriages , along with all the tax breaks and legal rights which those afford , will only come , he says , when Russian immigrants ( many of whom are not Jewish ) and gay people , and other groups who do not meet the religious standards of the Orthodox establishment , campaign together .
Until then , " the power will stay in the hands of the religious guys in Israel . "
One of those " religious guys " has an office in City Hall just down the corridor from Mr Weizmann .
As he squeezes into his small room , Councilman Binyamin Babayoff , from the ultra-religious Shas Party , produces a Bible and a fluorescent green marker pen .
He highlights Leviticus Chapter 18 , Verse 22 , for my benefit : " Thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is an abomination . "
Mr Babayoff says that the weddings will turn Tel Aviv into a modern - day Sodom and Gomorrah .
He reaches for the rhetorical question : " If a man wants to marry his sister , would that be OK ?
Would it be alright if , tomorrow , he wanted to marry his mother ? "
But despite his profound convictions , he accepts that the highly religious are in a minority in Tel Aviv , and that " we live in a democracy " .
" Just because you do n't agree , it does n't mean that you then have to go and make a big noise about it in public . "
It is enough , he says , to point out that " it is such a grave offence according to the Torah . "
OFFICIAL COMMITMENT
Israel 's democratic credentials , are , however , questioned by the lawyer , Irit Rosenblum .
Her New Family group is run out of one of the most handsom streets in Tel Aviv .
Irit Rosenblum is pioneering a scheme to give benefits to same - sex couples " We are the only democracy in the world , " she says , " that has no civil marriage . "
She began her fight to change that , nine years ago .
Back then , she says , they were " weirdos " .
Now , though , she sees more and more consensus .
New Family has produced a card , which , for about $ 60 , will aim to prove , officially , a couple 's commitment .
They sign an affadavit in front of a lawyer , and in return receive a small laminated card which , Irit Rosenblum says , affords the couple a range of municipal benefits , including easier parking , reduced health club membership , and lower local tax .
" Now they are considered to be a family . "
All this is still some distance from the situation in , for example , Britain - where the state now recognises civil partnerships between same - sex couples .
But last week , there were signs of change stirring .
The speaker of the Knesset ( Israeli Parliament ) attended a conference , in the Knesset , on gay rights .
Reuven Rivlin , of the governing right - wing Likud Party , declared : " The gay sector has been persecuted for many years ...
I need to stand up straight and say that you can be respected for any way in which you choose to lead your lives .
Bear the flag that you hoist with pride . "
A selection of your comments :
The issue of gay marriage is against the purpose of marriage .
In fact , it 's evil and unbiblical .
Those involved in it should come out from it before they will attract God 's anger .
Okorondu justin , Porth Harcourt , Nigeria
With all the fighting in the region one would think the country would embrace the thought of two people creating love and peace , not war .
I say we need more celebrations not funerals .
I wish everyone a happy pride day !
Verge , Toronto , Canada Homosexuality has always been condemned by God in the scriptures , be it Old Testament , New Testament or even the Muslim Holy Book .
If we believe that the scriptures are God breathed , then how does that which is an abomination in His eyes become OK if enough people agree ?
In Sodom and Gomorrah , God killed the entire city save 8 !
Democracy does n't make evil become good !
KS , Fort Myers , FL , USA
If someone wants to have gay marriage what 's the problem .
Until and unless the couples are not satisfied with each other , then there is a problem .
Shahbaz Khan , Baghdad , Iraq
This is typical of Israeli democracy .
The only one in the region !
It is very often forgotten by the BBC to mention just how pro-gay Tel Aviv and Israel is .
The fact is it's one of the most advanced and pro-gay societies in the world .

[ In this Gamasutra article , Nintendo and Microsoft Game Studios veteran Wilson talks about the value of diverse video game testing , suggesting a formula to make sure that your game debuts with the fewest bugs possible . ]
The need for wide - spectrum testing
In the process of software development , there are constant pitfalls and perils to avoid , both to application developers and game developers alike .
Software testing , one of the most resource - consuming stages of the development cycle , possesses more than its fair share of these problems , as well as tending to have an unfortunate stigma attached to it .
Some developers consider it a short process to find glaring errors , a necessary evil or a secondary concern .
Consumers consider it to be the stage in which any problem they have with the product should have been found ( often rightly so ) .
Testers themselves often consider the testing stage to be rushed or insufficient once it ends .
The biggest misconception about software testing is that any one method of testing is better than another .
There is both an art and a science to software testing , and neither of them should be ignored .
Testing a strict set of conditions or performing seemingly random tests just are n't enough by themselves , no matter how extensive the process becomes ; both the art and the science are needed to find as many of the bugs as possible , leaving the software as functional and polished as possible .
The differences between ad - hoc testing and test cases
Ad-Hoc Testing
Ad -hoc testing , also known as free testing , is a style of testing that definitely falls into the artistic side of the spectrum .
This form of testing is most often used in game testing , but it can also be found in consumer - use panels and focus groups , where individuals are brought in to try new software with very broad goals that they are directed to complete .
As a style , it is very fluid and often seems random ; a game tester may progress along half of a level as the developer intended only to attempt to jump through a crack in the environment , causing their character to leave the bounds of the environment and become stuck , unable to return to the normal flow of play .
When testing a piece of presentation software , a tester may attempt to loop through the entire presentation rapidly multiple times , not allowing time for the images or videos to load , which may stress the available memory to the point that the software stops responding and locks up .
The Good
While these seem like random things to try during the testing process , they are things that may occur in the real world .
This is where ad - hoc testing becomes an art : finding things that the end - user may attempt that the developers have n't planned for .
This may seem simple enough , but the amount of creativity necessary for this form of testing can sometimes seem staggering .
Entering a dungeon in a game , letting it populate halfway , then deciding to go back to town and save the game quickly may lock up the game -- but if a player forgets to save their game before entering a dungeon , it could definitely happen .
Plans can certainly be made to test these sorts of situations , but there 's no effective way to plan for them all .
This is where ad - hoc testing is the most useful : testing situations that may otherwise occur after release that were n't planned for during development .
The number of unusual actions good testers will try when left to their own devices can be surprising , and they will often find a fair number of problems that can then be corrected before release .
The Bad
While this sounds great , and it often finds some major issues that would otherwise have been unnoticed , there are a few problems with this method .
It 's almost impossible to cover all of a piece of software 's functionality in this way ; there 's often too much space to cover to allow a testing team to perform free testing without any focus .
Also , it is likely that more testers will focus on areas that they have a preference for over others , which will leave some areas of the software with less coverage .
To diminish this problem , many advocates for this style of testing temper their test plans by assigning ad - hoc testers to specific portions of the software , but this still is n't enough to compensate for the lack of disciplined testing .
Test Cases
This is the scientific side of testing .
Developers and test leads will produce a list of tests to be performed based on the functions in the product , which functions interact with other functions , what different parameters there are for each function , etc
Test cases are the counterpoint to ad - hoc testing ; where ad - hoc testing seems random , test cases are strict and disciplined .
They are used to go over a function , which can be as simple as moving between cells in a spreadsheet or as complex as casting an intricate spell at a group of enemies , from every point of view and with each command style that the writer of the test cases can think of .
The Good
Test cases perform where ad - hoc testing can often lack : they ensure that the most common actions that will be performed are tested in a large variety of ways in every area of the software .
This alone is a boon to the testing process , as the color palette that an ad - hoc tester may take for granted in the software they 're testing may have an incorrect variable call in just one format style , resulting in the desired blue becoming green .
A test case to check the color implementation for each color in each format would easily catch such problems .
The Bad
The amount of coverage a title receives through test cases is dependent upon the people writing the cases .
This coverage can be very extensive , especially when the test cases are written by people with years of experience and an in - depth knowledge of the functions that need to be tested , but nobody can account for everything that an end - user may attempt .
There are just too many random variables to be considered for test cases to cover every possible occurrence .
It 's also important to note that some testers may be easily bored by such strict testing protocols , which in rare cases could result in the test cases not being completed properly .
from the book “ Your Music and People ” : Some people like to pay .
Let them .
2009-06-03
Not everyone is broke .
When musicians put me on the guest list at a venue , I pay anyway .
I like to support the venue and the artist .
When the record label Magnatune let people pay as little as $ 5 to buy an album , they paid an average of $ 9.82 .
Many pay much more , because they know it goes to the artist .
Radiohead ’s album “ In Rainbows ” was offered for free , but 40 % of people chose to pay for it anyway .
It ’s like donating money to their favorite charity .
They do n’t have to , but it makes them happy .
When you ’re offering something for free , do n’t forget that there are lots of people that like to pay !
Appeal to this side of people , giving them a reason to pay that feels good .
Tell them what their payment will support .
Show them how much you appreciate the purchase .
It will actually make them happy to give you money .
A couple of weeks ago , I got a message from Robicelli ’s Gourmet Market Robicelli ’s Gourmet Market requesting that we come try their cupcakes .
We get tons of messages about events , products , and restaurants , and while I always appreciate the invitation and offerings , we just ca n’t get to every one .
There was something special about this message from Allison though .
Allison and her husband , Matt , are natives of Bay Ridge , who ’ve both spent time working at top restaurants around New York , but ultimately wanted to go home to Bay Ridge and open up a mom and pop shop .
While mom and pop shops are disappearing , they took on the challenge , and for that , they deserve all of our support .
What Robicelli’s has , is that personal touch that national chains do not have .
If you stop in , you ’ll likely find Allison and / or Matt working there , where they will spend the time to talk to you about everything and anything they sell .
If you want to learn about gourmet food , go there and ask .
Allison is more talkative but Matt has this tattoo .
Enough said .
We were invited to try their cupcakes , and that we did .
The husband and wife team have a friendly family feud going , about who makes better cupcakes , so try them and tell them which one you like more .
We got to try three flavors ( they make new flavors weekly ) and the winner for us was the Chocolate Turtle : Chocolate Cake with Salted Caramel Buttercream , Candied Pecans & Ganache .
Which one of you made these ?
Can I give you a hug ?
The moist chocolate cake tastes like chocolate , is n’t too sweet , and the Salted Caramel Buttercream is sweet , but has the true flavor of caramelized sugar .
It was insanely good , sophisticated , and beautiful before we let it melt ( sorry ) .
We also tried the Pecan French Toast ( too sweet for us because it ’s Maple Custard soaked ) , and Allison ’s Famous Carrot Cake , and a few things become quite evident .
1 . The cake portion is moist , which Allison attributes to making small batches .
( I ’ve complained countless times about dry cupcakes all over NYC . )
2 . They do not skimp on good quality ingredients .
For $ 2.50 per cupcake , these are the best bang or your buck cupcakes in NYC .
They make French Buttercream .
They garnish with nuts ( when appropriate ) .
You can really taste the flavors !
3 . Allison and Matt are talented and creative .
Seeing lists of other flavors they ’ve done ( check out some at Cupcakes Take the Cake ) , makes me want to go weekly to try their new flavor .
If I could just wish upon a star here , I would prefer them less sweet but , that ’s me .
Go there for cupcakes , but do n’t leave without the inside scoop .
They ’ve been around the block , or all over Bay Ridge , and know where to find lots of other great eats , often at other great places with that same personal touch that ’s really missing in Manhattan these days .
We got a long list from Allison and tried to eat as much as we could in 4 hours so stay tuned for : brunch at Hom , pizza at Nino ’s , Shore Road Bagels and Deli , Leske ’s Danish Bakery , and Roll - N - Roaster .
So , thanks for inviting us to Bay Ridge .
We think it ’s a delicious neighborhood and will be back for more .

WASHINGTON --
A transit train smashed into the rear of another at the height of the capital city 's Monday evening rush hour , killing at least six people and injuring scores of others as the front end of the trailing train jackknifed violently into the air and fell atop the first .
Cars of both trains were ripped open and smashed together in the worst accident in the Metrorail system 's 33 - year history .
Washington fire spokesman Alan Etter said crews had to cut some people out of what he described as a " mass casualty event . "
Rescue workers propped steel ladders up to the upper train cars to help survivors scramble to safety .
Seats from the smashed cars spilled out onto the track .
Washington Mayor Adrian
Fenty said six were confirmed dead .
Fire Chief Dennis Rubin said rescue workers treated 76 people at the scene and sent some of them to local hospitals , six with critical injuries .
A search for further victims continued into the night .
A Metro official said the dead included the female operator of the trailing train .
Her name was not immediately released .
The crash around 5 p.m. EDT ( 2100 GMT ) took place on the system 's red line , Metro 's busiest , which runs below ground for much of its length but is at ground level at the accident site near the Maryland border in northeast Washington .
Metro chief John Catoe said the first train was stopped on the tracks , waiting for another to clear the station ahead , when the trailing train , one of the oldest in the Metro fleet , plowed into it from behind .
Officials had no explanation for the accident .
The National Transportation Safety Board took charge of the investigation and sent a team to the site .
Washington police and the FBI also had investigators at the scene to help search the wreckage for any overlooked injured or dead passengers and evidence .
Each train had six cars and was capable of holding as many as 1,200 people .
Safety Board member Debbie Hersman said the trains were bound for downtown .
That would mean they were less likely to be filled during the afternoon rush hour .
More than 200 firefighters from Washington , Maryland and Virginia eventually converged on the scene .
Sabrina Webber , a 45 - year - old real estate agent who lives in the neighborhood , said the first rescuers to arrive had to use the " jaws of life " to pry open a wire fence along rail line to get to the train .
Webber raced to the scene after hearing a loud boom like a " thunder crash " and then sirens .
She said there was no panic among the survivors .
Passenger Jodie Wickett , a nurse , told CNN she was seated on one train , sending text messages on her phone , when she felt the impact .
She said she sent a message to someone that it felt like the train had hit a bump .
" From that point on , it happened so fast , I flew out of the seat and hit my head . "
Wickett said she stayed at the scene and tried to help .
She said " people are just in very bad shape . "
" The people that were hurt , the ones that could speak , were calling back as we called out to them , " she said .
" Lots of people were upset and crying , but there were no screams . "
One man said he was riding a bicycle across a bridge over the Metro tracks when the sound of the crash got his attention .
" I did n't see any panic , " Barry Student said .
" The whole situation was so surreal . "
At Howard University Hospital , Dr. Johnnie Ford , an emergency room doctor , said a 14 - year - old girl suffered two broken legs in the accident .
A 20 - year - old male patient " looked like he had been tumbled around quite a bit , bumps and bruises from head to toe , " Ford said .
Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said less than two hours after the crash that federal authorities had no indication of any terrorism connection .
" I do n't know the reason for this accident , " Metro's Catoe said .
" I would still say the system is safe , but we 've had an incident . "
Monday 's crash was the third major subway or commuter rail crash in a big city in the past nine months .
In the earlier accidents :
-- In September 2008 , a commuter rail train and a freight train crashed in Los Angeles , killing 25 people .
The crash was blamed on an engineer on the commuter rail sending text messages on a cell phone .
-- Last month about 50 people were injured in Boston when one trolley rear - ended another .
The conductor admitted to sending a text message when the crash occurred .
No reason was given for the Washington crash , but some safety experts are concerned about the recent increase .
" I 'm not sure if everyone in the safety system is paying the proper attention that needs to be paid , " said Barry Sweedler , a San Francisco - based safety consultant and former investigator and manager at the National Transportation Safety Board .
" These things should n't be happening . "
However , Robert Lauby , a former NTSB rail investigator , said the increase in accidents could well be mere coincidence .
" Just because you had them does n't mean there 's a specific issue that caused them , " Lauby said .
The only other time in Metrorail 's 33 - year history that there were passenger fatalities was on Jan. 13 , 1982 , when three people died as a result of a derailment underneath downtown .
That was a day of disaster in the capital -- shortly before the subway crash , an Air Florida plane slammed into the 14th Street Bridge immediately after takeoff in a severe snowstorm from Washington National Airport across the Potomac River .
The plane crash killed 78 people .
“ Every child is trained in one way or another , ” says Deborah Drapper ’s father .
“ Even if you just neglect them , that ’s a training .
But it ’s a different training . ”
Deborah , a 13 - year - old winsome blond , lives in the lush countryside of rural Britain with eight of her ten siblings .
She is articulate and sincere — and deeply disconcerting .
In a recent documentary aired on the BBC , Deborah 13 : Servant of God , we meet Deborah and her family , who seclude themselves from the rest of society and consider one another friends as well as kin .
Everything revolves around home and the family , including the children ’s education .
“ I think it teaches us everything we need to know for life , ” Deborah remarks after her mother explains why she and her husband chose to educate their children at home .
“ I ’d much rather be homeschooled than go to school . ”
Mr. Drapper candidly distinguishes between their approach to family and the normal life of state - schooled children — whom , he suggests , spend all day away from their parents , come home to a television meal , and then are off to meet their friends .
“ We have not had a television for 14 or 15 years , ” he says , “ but we are not completely cut off from the world .
We have computers ; we trust [ the children ] to be on the Internet in their bedrooms without fear of what they are coming up to , because we know who they are .
We know what their natures are , what their characters are .
So no , I do n’t have any worries about them missing out .
I ’m glad they miss out on some of it — the bullying , the peer - pressure , and being led into things that are inappropriate . ”
When presented with magazine images of Britney Spears and Victoria Beckham , neither Deborah nor her sister is able to identify them .
Protected from popular culture and worldly influence , their attention is focused not on entertainment but on learning to live “ God ’s way . ”
This includes keeping an open womb .
Deborah ’s mum — humbly endearing with her gentle British lilt — reveals that she and her husband decided to let God be in control and thus receive as many children as He wants to give them .
Deborah clings to her convictions , to her purpose , with even more determination than her parents .
At first impression , she seems like the perfect spokesperson for the fundamentalist vision .
She is intelligent ; her devotion to God and family is evident ; her faith strong and clear .
She cares nothing for fashion , since , after all , “ what does it matter that this hat is in style when all of the elements are burning up ? ”
Giving no thought to what other girls her age might be doing , Deborah says , “ I do n’t see anything special about someone my age . ”
She ’s an inspiration for beleaguered conservatives , who often struggle to raise children in a society that they perceive as hostile to their beliefs .
This picturesque family with a bold , outspoken young daughter seems to show that such a lifestyle is an attainable ideal .
Matthew , the oldest boy in the Drapper clan , is enrolled in college and studying to be a chef .
We see evidence of Deborah ’s rhetorical prowess in a conversation they share while he is home on break .
“ Here ’s my question , okay ? ” she says .
“ Science .
Define science . ”
Matthew and Deborah are reclining on a rock , overlooking the countryside .
“ Science is stuff you can prove , ” Matthew offers , seemingly intimidated by the mind of his younger sister .
“ Science is like knowledge basically , ” asserts Deborah .
“ Things you can observe and test and demonstrate and test again and again and get the same result .
Okay , so that ’s science .
So here ’s my question . ”
She pauses to fold her hands , almost prayerfully .
“ How can you test and observe and demonstrate the Big Bang ? ”
“ It ’s a belief , ” says Matthew .
“ Exactly .
There ’s no scientific evidence for it at all . ”
Deborah speaks , as always , with assurance .
“ You would have to need help to believe a theory that stupid . ”
We never meet the documentary ’s narrator , who pushes Deborah , at times aggressively , to defend her positions .
One wonders about the agenda behind the camera .
Does this child pose a threat to the filmmakers ’ worldview ?
Do they hope to discredit this little girl before she even reaches adulthood ?
But Deborah holds her own , fearless and strong as any old tent - revival preacher .
After every effort to remain untainted by the world , however , her initially sunny demeanor can turn unexpectedly morbid .
“ I think anyone who told the smallest white lie should be going to hell , ” she says , “ so , we should all be going to hell . ”
“ But what if hell does n’t exist ? ” the narrator interjects .
The wind tousles her hair as she stops to ponder this question .
“ Well then , I ’ll die and go to the grave and that will be it . ”
Deborah ’s serious demeanor belies the girlie pink top she wears ; she is , after all , barely a teenager .
“ But what if it does exist ?
What will happen to you ? ”
Dramatic silence .
“ If I die and that is the end , it is probably a waste of my life .
I ’ll just be dead .
But if you die , and there is a hell , you wo n’t just be dead . ”
By far , her favorite tool for evangelism is fear of eternal damnation .
She takes part in a family puppet show which not - so - subtly proclaims judgment , fire , weeping , and gnashing of teeth to a very young audience — messages that horrify parents in attendance .
This is the fear that emboldens Deborah to witness everywhere she goes .
“ I do n’t like to make people upset , ” she says , “ but it ’s good to make them scared about hell . ”
Eternal fire is the punch line for an ice - breaker she often uses , an old trick for those trying to secure souls for God .
“ Do you believe you are a good person ? ” she asks .
The inevitable “ yes ” plays right into her spiel .
“ Have you ever told a lie ?
Stolen anything ?
Taken
God ’s name in vain ?
How , then , can you call yourself good ? ”
She asserts her own wretchedness ; with tears , she explains that if it were n’t for Jesus , whom she found “ on my own at age six , ” she would be going to hell herself for her many sins .
“ I think I am living my life like I want to , ” she muses .
“ I ’ve given my life to the Lord ; anything that happens to it is what He wants .
I ’ll probably be dead longer than I am alive — it ’s just a wee dash between two dates : when you were born and when you die .
You know it ’s not that much , but I ’ve given my wee dash to the Lord . ”
How long can this preoccupation with the gravity of life and death persist ?
One wonders how Deborah will change with age , if she will grant herself some metaphysical slack when more temporal matters assert themselves .
But for the moment , her mission is clear , and her focus remains steadfastly on eternity .
GM and Segway have teamed up before the New York Auto Show on what they ’re calling the PUMA project .
The prototype vehicle was exclusively unveiled today on the Today Show .
It ’s no April Fool ’s joke .
http://jalopnik.com/5201180/gm-segway-to-unveil-new-two+wheeled-urban-vehicle
PUMA stands for Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility and the prototype running around outside NBC ’s Today Show this morning is an experimental prototype of a vehicle Larry Burns , GM ’s vice president of research and development , and strategic planning , claims we ’ll see a roadable version by January .

The 300 - pound prototype runs on a lithium - ion battery and uses Segway ’s characteristic two - wheel balancing technology , along with dual electric motors .
It ’s designed to reach speeds of up to 35 miles - per - hour and can run 35 miles on a single charge .
There ’s other cool advantages as well .
This PUMA pod , also could involve a vast communications network that would allow vehicles to interact with each other , regulate the flow of traffic and prevent crashes from happening .
The appliance - ization of transportation continues !

UPDATE : Segway just released the following video of Project P.U.M.A. in action ( Hat tip to The College Driver ! ) .
We ’ll have our own video and photos from the live reveal underway right now here in New York very soon .
Kids Painting Easel
These retail for $ 60 +
We built this one for $ 11 , it is bigger and better .
A lot of people are not aware of the free stuff you can get .
Surplus to our consumer society .
I approached our local motorcycle dealership and a kitchen design place .
At the first I could take whatever packing crates the motorcycles and mowers came in , both steel and timber .
At the second place I got some useful melamine offcuts .
All freely given after I asked and explained what I was doing .
The two solid lengths of timber I got were 6 ft each .
I needed three legs , so my easel was then 4 ft high , based on my available timber .
I got two legs and then joined the third leg with a halved joint and glue and screws .
I then cut the tops as seen in the photo and drilled a hole through them for the bolt .
This bolt will allow the easel to spread and collapse .
Next I braced the two front legs with a length of timber from the one way pallet .
On top of this I scew nailed a melamine offcut to hold the textas , crayons , paints etc .
To the front of this I nailed part of the mdf we would use as the backing board .
I screwed a chain between one front leg and the back one to provide some more stability , but it is pretty solid and not too heavy .
Here it is in action .
It will provide many years of service , as you can see my daughter can grow into it .
We have yet to give it a protective coat of paint .
Also we thought we would get some blackboard paint for the back of the mdf to make it into a blackboard as well .
Anyway , many hours of fun ahead .
Cheap , sturdy and did n't take long .

Bluefin tuna - the staple of sushi boxes the world over - is on the brink of extinction , with its plight highlighted in a new film .
Sandwich seller Pret A Manger is changing its stance on tuna , but should the rest of us follow suit ?
The bluefin tuna is one of the world 's most impressive fish - a predatory cruiser of the open ocean that can zoom through the sea at the rate of 40 mph and grow to the size of a small car .
What we try and do is link it to everything else in the sea , like turtles and whales and big sharks
Giles Bartlett , WWF
The bluefin has become the unwitting star of the campaign to end overfishing .
The End of the Line , a documentary based on a book by journalist Charles Clover , examines the mismanagement of bluefin fisheries as a microcosm of how we are hoovering the seas of their fish .
The bluefin is particularly prized in Japan .
And the explosion in the market for sushi - which 25 years ago was a relative rarity outside Japan - has created a global market for the three species of bluefin , as has the taste for omega - 3 - rich tuna steaks to be pan - fried or thrown on a barbecue .
" Bluefin tuna has become the poster boy for the overfishing campaign .
It 's on the buffers - it 's really on the slide down now , " Clover says .
" There are no large tuna anymore .
There were bluefins of 250lb in Japanese fish markets when I went there four years ago - there are none now .
A third of the catch is undersize . "
1 . Fish shoals are encircled by a large " wall " of net 2 .
Net is closed off at base , like a purse 3 .
Fish captured along with a bycatch of non-target species , including bluefin and dolphins
The backlash against those selling bluefin has already begun - a raft of celebrities , including actress Charlize Theron and Sting , have barracked high - end fusion restaurant chain Nobu for still offering the critically endangered bluefin - some have likened it to offering a dish made of tiger or white rhino .
Let 's be clear - bluefin is not the tuna you add to your jacket potato or rustle up a tuna pasta bake with .
The tuna that finds its way into cans is usually the much more common skipjack variety .
But even the catching of skipjack impacts on the bluefin .
Skipjacks are caught using purse - seine nets , which encircle an area before being pulled together in the shape of a purse .
Rod and line " The trouble is , " Clover says , " the skipjack run with all these other tuna species , like bigeye and bluefin .
The skipjack are close to the surface and the bluefins swim further down , so there is often bluefin bycatch . "
The solution may be to buy canned tuna which is caught by pole and line - fishing vessels with rods and lines .
This method is much less wasteful , with fewer fish dying from bycatch - and underage fish can be returned to the sea .
Bluefin tuna - too valuable to ignore for fishermen Clover 's film , which had its premiere in the UK on Monday , has already had an effect on another high - street name , the Pret A Manger sandwich chain .
Co-founder Julian Metcalfe was so incensed when he saw the film he made the chain change its policy on tuna .
Out went the yellowfin tuna from the sushi - less endangered than bluefin , but still overfished .
The tuna and cucumber sandwiches are - from July - to use only supplies from a sustainable rod-and - line fishery from the Maldives , says the chain 's head of sustainability , Nicki Fisher .
" Our skipjack was dolphin - friendly but was still caught by purse seine nets .
The dolphins could get out of the nets , but the sharks , the turtles and the bluefin could n't .
Seeing the film has really galvanised us into action . "
Other supermarkets have also been taking action .
Supermarket changes Marks & Spencer made its big announcement on Tuesday , boasting it is the first of the supermarkets to switch to pole - and - line - caught tuna , not just with fresh and canned but also in sandwiches and salads .
The retailer sells 20,000 tuna sandwiches per day .
Sainsburys switched a while back to using pole - and - line - caught for all own brand canned and fresh tuna , while Morrisons says all own brand fresh , and some canned , is pole - and - line .
Waitrose is introducing an own brand pole - and - line canned range and Co-op has 60 % of its own brand as pole - and - line , Greenpeace says .
Environmental groups have hit out at the mismanagement of the fishery
But the environmental campaign group has criticised the two big tuna suppliers Princes and John West for not making the switch .
" John West tuna is largely made of skipjack tuna caught using a combination of pole - and - line and purse seine fishing .
Global stocks of skipjack are scientifically recognised as being healthy and are not overfished , " says John West board member Adolfo Valsecchi .
Mr Valsecchi suggests the firm does its utmost to minimise bycatch and promote sustainability in both purse seine and pole - and - line fishing .
Moving to pole - and - line across the skipjack market would help eliminate the issue of bluefin killed because of bycatch , but it would not get rid of the wider problem .
Efforts to regulate the fishery in the Mediterranean - where the Atlantic population of bluefin migrates to spawn - have failed because the Sicilian and Neapolitan mafias have a stake in the fisheries , and have little compunction about putting profit ahead of sustainability .
Illegal tuna worth more than $ 6bn ( £ 3.2 bn ) is thought to have made its way to Japanese markets in the 20 years up to 2006 .
Also , tuna spend their life on the move , and range over a number of territorial waters to and from spawning grounds , which has made the management of the fishery by the likes of the European Union so difficult .
Giles Bartlett , the fisheries officer for the Worldwide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , admits that while the WWF was able to make an icon of some endangered animals , like the panda , a fish may be a more difficult sell .
" That 's the real challenge we face .
What we try and do is link it to everything else in the sea , like turtles and whales and big sharks , " he says .
" It 's not just about sustainable fishing , it 's about how we look after the oceans as well . "
What Mr Bartlett says will save the bluefin is a better fisheries management system - at the moment the Mediterranean fishery continues to fish thousands of tonnes more each year than even the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) scientists say is allowable .
He says centralised management , with quotas revised once a year , will not work .
Fishermen have to agree quotas , and have the flexibility to manage them over five or 10 years .
For the moment , though , sushi lovers cannot look forward to a guilt - free portion of bluefin .
Below is a selection of your comments .
The final line of the piece on bluefin tuna sums it up for me .
Using the phrase for the moment suggest there is some hope for the bluefin tuna , and for me , as a fisheries scientist and someone who has worked with fisheries all over the world I can't see that happening .
I do n't believe there will ever be a time when guilt free bluefin will be available , certainly not in my lifetime .
The problem is there is too many vested interests for the politicians in the EU making the decision .
They do n't police it because they want the votes or are scared to upset the fishermen ( like the scenes from the cod closure ) .
It seems that the lessons learned from the cod in Canada have not been learned .
Will it take the extinction of one of the most beautiful and perfectly evolved marine fish species before sensible fisheries management is implemented across the world ?
The fact that some scientists believe bluefin tuna has already collapsed and that the actual catch is almost 6 times what should really be taken suggests this species will be added to the list currently populated by the dodo , the great auk and other species man 's greed has been responsible for making extinct .
Adam Payne , Oxford , UK
As a marine biologist , it is heartening to see major supermarket chains starting to take note of these issues and changing their approach to sourcing fish .
I hope that the message also trickles through to those companies who still think it is acceptable to carry on serving and selling fish that are either endangered , or are part of an unsustainable fishery .
Charlotte , Southampton
This movie , End of the Line , along with the award - winning Sharkwater , should be made compulsory viewing by the government at all schools across the UK .
How difficult would that be ?
That 's how we should get the message out there and the plight of the oceans into our children 's consciousness .
Sophia Butler - Cowdry , London , UK
No , if you catch tuna with a pole and line you tend to snag sea birds , that 's why albatross numbers are plummeting faster than a gannet after a mackerel .
There is no easy , sustainable way of catching these fish , so stop it , we 're not going to die of starvation .
Paul Braham , Ringwood UK I have not yet seen the ' End of the Line ' documentary , but having read this article and a few other similar items recently , I will be cutting bluefin and yellowfin tuna out and only eating pole and line caught skipjack tuna from now on .
What really bothers me is that without the sort of media attention that this story and similar have had , people are not in a position to make an informed decision about whether or not to eat , buy or use a certain product .
Scientific information of this sort should be available for all types of product that have an environmental impact of one kind or another , to enable consumers to make informed choices .
The big chicken debate last year was a similar situation , albeit higher profile - without knowing what really goes on how can we be in a position to take steps as consumers to try and change it ?
Duncan Paine , Cheshire , UK
Well we 're back to the age old problem of too many human mouths to feed , fishermen being a bit over greedy maybe , but there again , human population drives the demand .
Cuts in human population will create a better wildlife \human balance and therefore stories like this wo n't need to be written .
There are something like 6 billion people on the planet which with today 's technologies is about 2 - 3 billion too many .
The numbers are unsustainable .
Frederick , London
The only way to police our seas is to incorporate an international fish regulation policy .
This must be backed by all governments or fishermen will not listen .
We must learn from the Canadian cod lesson .
Naval backing may even be necessary where rogue fishermen are concerned .
Adhere to the regulations or face stern action .
Joseph , Liverpool
It is n't really true to say that bluefin is a staple of sushi boxes .
It has been a rarity for some time now , and only available at the most expensive sashimi restaurants .
The tuna you get in most high street sushi restaurants is usually yellowfin , perhaps albacore .
Regardless of what the cannery companies say , tuna is on its way out .
You 'll notice that it will gradually get more expensive until it is eventually given blanket protection .
Sadly that will be after the fishery has collapsed .
Simon Rogerson , London
The basic problem is that there are too many of us , and the planet is simply not big enough to provide us all with what we need to eat .
We are about to do an Easter Island , but on a much grander scale .

Click here to hear Liam Neeson 's entire speech
Click here for special Liam Neeson photo gallery
( article and audio copyright 2009 IrishCentral LLC )
In his first public speaking appearance since losing his wife Natasha Richardson in a tragic skiing accident , Irish actor Liam Neeson last night quoted poet Paul Muldoon on how art helps the heart heal .
Art “ builds from pain , from misery , from a deep - seated hurt , a monument to the human heart that shines like a golden dome among roofs rain - glazed and leaden . ”
Neeson was being awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater , Queens University Belfast , at a ceremony in New York at the British Consulate .
Ironically , the event came almost exactly a year after he and Natasha were honored by the American Ireland Fund at their annual dinner in May .
Expressing his deep gratitude for all the school had give him , Neeson said he learned one great lesson while there : " I think it is a message that a university always gives its students in the end :
It ’s time to move on , get on with your life .
I got on with mine , and I ’m still getting on . "
Then , to a good bit of laughter from the star - struck crowd , Neeson thanked the university for finally giving him a degree .
“ I started my course of studies at Queens 38 years ago .
It ’s been a long haul and a rather crooked path .
It feels good to have a degree in my hand , ” said Neeson , who left the college before graduating .
The actor 's two sons , Michael and Daniel , sat with family friends closest to the podium , and chuckled when they saw their royally - robed father make his entrance .
Neeson gave them a playful wink .
“ You could hear a pin drop ” said a person who was at the event .
" The love in the room for Liam was very evident . ”
Neeson appeared nervous at first , and apologized for reading his speech from notes .
“ Everybody assumes that actors are great public speakers .
It ’s terrifying .
Forgive me for reading it , ” he said .
He recounted his years in Queens and his lack of involvement with all that was happening in Northern Ireland during The Troubles .
Then , in January 1972 in the aftermath of Bloody Sunday -- one of the most violent days of The Troubles when 14 unarmed civilians were killed in Derry by a British paratrooper regiment -- Neeson suddenly woke up to a new reality .
“ I ’d go into my morning classes and was surprised to find them largely empty .
Only two or three other students in my physics lecture hall .
Leaving the building after class and walking back to the halls of residence , I was surrounded by a throng of about a hundred angry students who shouted at me , called me a scab .
They were protesting against the Bloody Sunday killings , which had happened the day before , and were staging a university - wide strike .
" I had been totally unaware of the events the day before , totally unaware of the students ’ strike , and almost totally unaware of the larger grim struggle that was going on in Ireland .
‘ It was an experience that shook me deeply , in complicated ways .
But the message I took then was , ' Boy , you ’ve got to wake up .
Get moving .
You ’ve got to get going . '
" It came to me maybe with more of a short , sharp shock than it does to most , ” he said .
" But in a way , I think it is a message that a university always gives its students in the end : I got on with my life , and I ’m still getting on . "
He said he took the same message from the role he first played onstage in Brian Friel ’s " Philadelphia Here I Come , ” which he called " a play about the need to get on with your life , of the wrench of departure that comes with that need . "
At the end of his speech , Neeson choked up , barely able to get out his last line .
But the accomplished actor came through :
" I ’m a deeply honored and humbled man from Ballymena tonight . "

As reported in the Hartford Courant , Hal Turner has been arrested for asking his audience to kill two elected officials and an official from a regulatory agency .
Finally , someone is treating the advocates for domestic terrorism the right way .
Mr. Turner 's comments are above and beyond the threshold of free speech , " Capitol police Chief Michael J. Fallon said in an e-mail announcing the warrant .
" He is inciting others through his website to commit acts of violence and has created fear and alarm .
He should be held accountable for his conduct . "
So what did he say that was so bad ?
Sexual abuse was " endemic " in State - run institutions for boys and children lived in " daily terror " of being beaten over more than five decades , the long - awaited Commission into Child Abuse report has found .
The report , that runs to thousands of pages , outlined a harrowing account of the emotional , physical and sexual abuse inflicted on young people who attended schools and institutions from 1940 onwards .
It found that corporal punishment was " pervasive , severe , arbitrary and unpredictable " in the institutions where " children lived with the daily terror of not knowing where the next beating was coming from . "
The report said that the level of emotional abuse of disadvantaged , neglected and abandoned children by religious and lay staff was " disturbing " and that the Catholic Church was aware long - term sex offenders were repeatedly abusing children .
There were angry scenes at the launch of the report in Dublin 's Conrad Hotel this afternoon when some victims were refused admission .
Reacting to the report , victims ' group
One in Four said it was a " shameful day for Ireland " .
The report is a devastating indictment of Church and State authorities when it came to their exercise of responsibility for the care of children in the Republic of Ireland throughout most of the 20th century .
The Commission , set up in May 2000 , heard evidence from almost 2,000 people who spent their childhood in 216 institutions in the Republic , mainly in the decades between 1940 and the mid-1980s .
However it also heard evidence from some people going back as far as 1914 and up to 2000 .
Sexual abuse was " endemic in boys institutions " , involving such abuse by some staff members and some older boys .
Sexual abuse " was not systematic in girls ' schools " , though girls were subjected to predatory sexual abuse by male employees ( of the institutions ) or visitors or in outside placements .
Among the boys ' industrial schools investigated in detail by the Commission were Artane in Dublin , Letterfrack in Galway , St Joseph 's in Salthill Co Galway and St Joseph 's in Tralee Co Kerry , which were all run by the Christian Brothers .
Also investigated was the boys ' reformatory at Daingean , Co Offaly , run by the Oblate fathers , as well as industrial schools at Ferryhouse , Co Tipperary and at Upton , Co Cork run by the Rosminian fathers , and Greenmount industrial school in Cork , run by the Presentation Brothers .
Where girls ' institutions were concerned it investigated Goldenbridge industrial school in Dublin , St Joseph's in Clifden Co Galway , St Michael 's at Cappoquin , Co Waterford and St Joseph's in Dundalk Co Louth , all of which were run by the Sisters of Mercy .
It also investigated St Patrick 's girls ' industrial school in Kilkenny which was run by the Sisters of Charity .
Where all such institutions were concerned the Commission found that " children were frequently hungry , food was inadequate , inedible and badly prepared in many schools . "
Clothing was " a particular problem in boys ' schools where children often worked for long hours outdoors on farms .
In addition , boys were often left in their soiled and wet clothes throughout the day and wore them for long periods . "
But where all were concerned , " in all schools up until the 1960s clothes stigmatized the children as industrial school residents . "
Accommodation in the institutions was " cold , spartan and bleak " with sanitary provision " primitive " in most boys ' schools particularly .
Academic education " was not seen as a priority for industrials school children " and " in reality , the industrial training afforded by all schools was of a nature that served the needs of the institution rather than the needs of the child . "
A finding which the Commission said was " a disturbing element " of the evidence presented before it , was " `the level of emotional abuse that disadvantaged , neglected and abandoned children were subjected to generally by religious and lay staff '' at the institutions .
Witnessing such abuse of other children , as well as witnessing beatings , " had a powerful and distressing impact " on children .
Separation of siblings and restrictions on family contacts " were profoundly damaging for family relationships . "
It meant that " some children lost their sense of identity and kinship , which was never recovered . "
In addition to the conclusions above the Commission found that " schools were run in a severe , regimented manner that imposed unreasonable and oppressive discipline on children and even staff . "
The system of institutionalisation in Ireland at the time was " a response to a 19th century social problem , which was outdated and incapable of meeting the needs of individual children . "
The defects of the system " were exacerbated by the way it was operated by the ( religious ) congregations . "
It also found that " the capital and financial commitment made by the religious was a major factor in prolonging the system " while " the system of funding through capitation grants led to demands by managers ( of the institutions ) for children to be committed to industrial schools for reasons of economic viability of the institutions . "
By contrast it found that in England , from the mid-1920s on , " smaller , or family - like settings " were set up and were seen to provide better care for children in need .
The Commission noted how , despite these advances in England , " in Ireland , however , the industrial school system thrived . "
Where the Department of Education was concerned the Commission found that its " deferential and submissive attitude " towards the religious congregations " compromised its ability to carry out its statutory duty of inspections and monitoring of the schools . "
The institutions were also " accorded a low status within the Department " which " generally saw itself as facilitating the congregations and the resident managers ( of the institutions ) . "
It found that the system of inspection of the institutions by the Department of Education " was fundamentally flawed and incapable of being effective . "
Noting that " many witnesses who complained of abuse nevertheless expressed some positive memories " and that " small gestures of kindness were vividly recalled " , the Commission 's final conclusion was that " more kindness and humanity would have gone a long way to make up for poor standards of care " in the institutions .
Speaking at the launch of the report today , the head of the commision , Mr Justice Sean Ryan , said : “ For all that the report tries to do , it does not try to balance what happened to children in institutions against what might have become of them if they had not been taken into care in the first place . ”
“ When you take people into a State - regulated , statutory systems of care , whether it is right or wrong to subject them to such detention , you owe them a duty to take proper care of them and it cannot be an answer to a complaint about abuse or inadequate care that the people would have been worse off if you had not taken them in . ”
He also said all parties had co-operated with the commission in its investigation and singled out in particular among the religious congregations , the Rosminians for praise who operated industrial schools at Upton in Cork and Ferryhouse in Tipperary .
He said the Rosminian congregation accepted responsibility for the abuse in their institutions but they did not stop at that point .
Their attitude was to seek to understand the abuse whereas other congregations tried to explain it .
The Swedish Pirate Party - a group of online radicals who back free downloading of music and films from the internet - is taking advantage of a series of high profile anti-piracy cases to stage a pan-European electoral assault for 2009 's European elections .
" The battle over our privacy and the hunt on filesharers is fought down in Brussels .
That is why we want to go there , " the party 's leader Rickard Falkvinge told EUobserver .
The group 's electoral platform is based on three principles : to fundamentally reform copyright law , get rid of the patent system , and ensure that citizens ' rights to privacy are respected .
" Not only do we think these are worthwhile goals .
We also believe they are realistically achievable on a European basis .
The sentiments that led to the formation of the Pirate Party in Sweden are present throughout Europe , " reads a party declaration .
It was in 2006 , after a new law forbidding the downloading of copyright protected material from the internet , such as music and films , was introduced , that a group of Swedish file sharers decided to start a political movement , attracting over 4000 supporting signatures within the first 24 hours of the party 's launch .
A list of possible future MEPs has now been drafted , and the party is convinced it stands a good chance of winning a seat in the European assembly .
" All the way up to the election in June , controversial legislation surrounding our issues are in the pipelines .
The debate puts the spotlight on us , and attract voters , " Rickard Falkvinge said .
The Pirate Party has already surpassed the long - established Green and Left parties in number of active members , while its youth wing , " Young Pirates " , has become the second biggest political youth group in the country .
The group needs an estimated 100,000 votes to cross the country 's four percent threshold in the election - a number the party thinks can be achieved by appealing to those who normally would not bother to vote but who do regularly share their strong views on computer freedoms : students , particularly at technical universities .
Perfect timing
The timing of the European elections is perfect for those who defend cost - free consumption of culture online .
The Swedish media , political establishment and public opinion has for over a year been involved in heated discussions about surveillance in society , bringing file - sharing and online rules to the top of the political agenda .
Last summer , a controversial law on tapping e-mails was passed by the Swedish parliament , giving officials the power to open all emails and listen to any telephone conversation in the country .
The bill provoked widespread opposition , with protesters handing out copies of George Orwell 's 1984 .
Soon after , the new " Ipred- law " , based on the European Union 's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive , which would give copyright holders the right to seek a court order requiring internet service providers to reveal the names of people linked to IP - addresses through which illegal downloading occurs , caused a fresh ruckus .
Over 50,000 internet users immediately signed up to the " Stop the Ipred - law " group on Facebook , and the Pirate Party signed up 600 new members in only one day .
Expressen , a daily newspaper , wrote in an editorial that even though the EU has given young people things like the Erasmus study programme , aka the possibility of drinking wine in another EU country with other European youngsters , it has not made EU politics more interesting to them .
But the fact that the Brussels makes proposals such as the Ipred - law and the data retention directive has caught the young voters interest in the EU , the paper stated , guessing that election participation among the young would reach unexpected heights in June if for no other reason than pure " Ipred - fury " .
Media - hyped trial
More than 10 percent of the Swedish population participates in file - sharing , according to Statistics Sweden .
For men between the ages of 26 to 35 , the figure rises to 56 percent .
With new anti-piracy measures , around 1.3 million ' ordinary people ' - and voters - of all ages , professions and social backgrounds , risk being criminalised for a hobby they have no intention of giving up , and they are closely following the state of play with legislation that affects file - sharing .
On 16 February , a highly publicised trial of the content industry begnan against those responsible for the Pirate Bay , a site that enables people to find others willing to share audio , video , games and other files with them .
Four individuals have been charged with being accessories to breaking copyright law , facing fines or up to two years in prison if found guilty .
Plaintiffs in the case include media giants such as Warner Bros , MGM , Colombia Pictures Industries , 20th Century Fox , Sony BMG , Universal and EMI , led by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) .
They are claiming damages of € 12 million .
The first day of the trial was such an event that Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter 's reported that tickets to get the courtroom were selling on the black market for as high as €50 .
The trial 's political undercurrent has been powerful , with the Pirate Party accepting more than 2000 new members since it began .
The court 's decision on the Pirate Bay trial is due on April 17 .
European pirates unite
While Sweden is home to the first Pirate Party , similar groupings have since sprung up all over Europe , many of which are planning to run in the June elections on the same manifesto as their Swedish peers .
The German Pirate Party is busy trying to collect enough signatures to be able to run in the election .
" We have got a lot of hard work to do … but we really want to reach the goal we set for ourselves , to take part in the European elections , " a spokesperson for the German pirate branch states on the party 's website .
In an interview with Canal Plus , the leader of the Spanish Pirate Party , Carlos Ayala , explains that his party will use the internet rather than traditional campaigning methods to reach disaffected voters ahead of the June elections .
Other countries with their own pirate branches include Finland , Poland , Austria , Belgium and France .
But not all have the same instant appeal to their voters .
" It 's not realistic to hope for our own all - pirates political group in the European Parliament this year , but definitely for 2014 , " Rikard Falkvinge told this website .
Under current EU assembly rules , a party must have at least 25 members from seven member states .
" We want to free Molly from her terrible pain .
If there is anyone out there who may be able to help then we would love to hear from them . "
Feature Article - February 2000 by Do-While Jones
Let ’s Talk About Lucy
One of the best known “ human ancestors ” is an Australopithecus afarensis skeleton called Lucy .
Probably nobody knows more about Lucy and her species than her discover , Donald Johanson .
So let ’s see what Donald Johanson has to say about Australopithecus afarensis .
All Those Fossils
Of the 250 hominid fossils we found at Hadar between 1973 and 1975 that led to the naming of a new species , Australopithecus afarensis , the earliest bones are from 3.4 million years ago .
Dato ’s discovery -- if it was 3 million years old -- had allowed us to double our estimates as to the length of time that hominids lived at Hadar .
1
These " 16 fossils " make up just part of one skull .
Our most observant readers will immediately notice that it is a male skull .
Just how was this skull found ?
We are so glad you asked .
We went looking for Yoel Rak , an Israeli paleoanthropologist who had interrupted his anatomy lectures at Tel Aviv University to join us in the field .
Yoel had looked furiously for hominid fossils at Hadar in 1990 but came up empty - handed .
He said he could n’t leave this year without finding a hominid , and as an expert on the australopithecine face , what he really wanted was a skull , which had so far eluded us .
2 … Perhaps because
Yoel was with me , I began mentally picturing skull fragments -- smooth , flat , slightly dished pieces of bone .
Then I blew away some soft sand in front of me and saw the edges of a pair of eye sockets .
“ Oh my God , ” I shouted .
“ Here ’s part of the skull .
We ’ve got glabella ! ”
Glabella , one of the reference points used for skull measurements , is the most forward projecting part of the forehead , just above the bony ridge over the eye sockets .
3
This brings up a question of objectivity .
Evolutionists sometimes criticize creationists for starting with a preconceived notion , and then looking for evidence to back up that conclusion .
If it is wrong for creationists to do this , then it is wrong for evolutionists to do it , too .
There should not be a double standard .
We do n’t entirely agree with the evolutionists ’ claim that it is wrong to look for data to support a theory .
You rarely find something unless you are actively seeking it .
There are scientists who believe there is a cure for AIDS , and they are looking for it .
There is nothing wrong with that .
It only becomes wrong if the desire to find the cure makes you consciously ( or unconsciously ) report the results incorrectly .
That is , there is nothing wrong if a zealous doctor actually finds a cure for AIDS .
There is something wrong if he manipulates the data to make it appear that he has found a cure when he has n’t .
So , we do n’t blame Yoel Rak and Donald Johanson for looking for a hominid skull .
We realize , however , that their strong desire to find something may have affected their analysis of what they actually discovered .
Johanson certainly seemed to make a positive identification of a fragmentary bone very quickly .
Therefore , we are just a little bit cautious about taking the Australopithecus face he found at face value .
Does Money Corrupt ?
In October 1973 , we arrived at Hadar with nine other French and American scientists , prepared for a two - month stay .
By this time I had left Chicago and taken a job teaching anthropology at Case Western Reserve University , in Cleveland .
With these credentials , I had managed to get some funding for my first expedition as a co-leader .
I knew , though , that I had to prove myself by finding some hominids or the money would dry up .
4
Imagine what would have happened if he had found these fossils and reported , “ I found a lot of ape bones . ”
You can almost hear the money cracking as it dries up .
Does money really influence the interpretation of data ?
That ’s hard to say , but after almost 30 years working in the defense industry , I ’ve noticed an interesting pattern .
Whenever a weapon system is in trouble , and its funding is about to be cut off , the test results show that the weapon works well enough to go into production .
Then , after the weapon is introduced into the fleet , and funding is about to be cut because the project was successfully completed , there always seems to be a study that shows that the weapon does n’t work well enough , and a “ product improvement program ” gets funded .
Is it just a coincidence that studies always seem to come to the conclusion that brings the most money ?
Remember the “ evidence of life ” found on the “ Martian Meteorite ” in August , 1996 ?
That sure gave the NASA Mars program a big boost .
By December 14 , 1996 , Science News reported that , “ they do n’t have a shred of evidence to back it up . ”
Do you think money was a factor in the initial report ?
A passionate desire to prove evolution ( and a pressing need to fund for further research ) may have affected Johanson ’s analysis .
Consider these statements :
I found a bone from the palm of the hand , a second metacarpal , looking more like a fresh twentieth - century bone than one that had been buried for 3 million years .
5
Did he ever consider , even for a moment , the possibility that it does n’t look 3 million years old because it really is n’t 3 million years old ?
Could it look more like a 20th century bone because it might be just a few hundred years old ?
There are probably evolutionists reading this who are thinking to themselves , “ That ’s ridiculous .
That bone could n’t be hundreds of years old because Australopithecines died out 3 million years ago . ”
How do they know when they became extinct ?
Evolutionists claimed that the coelacanth had been extinct for millions of years before one was captured alive a few years ago .
Maybe Johanson has actually found evidence that Australopithecines lived in modern times .
He says it looks fresh .
Maybe it is fresh .
Calibrated Fossils
Though we had no confirmed dates yet from the rocks at Hadar , by comparing other mammal fossils from Hadar , especially pig teeth , with those that had been found at the Omo , Tom Gray and I suspected that the knee joint could be between 3 and 4 million years old .
6
When radioactive dating gives the desired results ( i.e. , the same as the presumed age of the pig fossils ) , then radioactive dating is considered to be precise and accurate .
But when it gives different ages , then the radioactive dates are swept under the rug with statements like this one :
The site , known as Gona , has hundreds of stone tools -- flaked pebbles and cobbles of lava -- that may be the oldest example of human technology , some 2.5 million years old .
The ash layers at Gona , however , do not give reliable dates , and Bob has been struggling since 1975 to determine the age of these artifacts .
7
When that was written in 1994 , poor old Bob had been trying for almost 20 years to get a radioactive date close enough to 2.5 million years that people would believe it .
We wonder how many times he tried , and what dates he actually got .
Did he consistently get 50 million years ?
Did he get ages that vary from 1 million years to 200 million years ?
We will never know because they wo n’t be published .
The justification for not publishing them will be , “ There is no reason to publish them because they are obviously erroneous . ”
Evidence Against Evolution
Separated by 200,000 years , these fossils were almost identical -- making a good case for little evolutionary change in this hominid species .
From fossils found at a site south of Hadar , the Middle Awash , we know that Australopithecus afarensis existed as far back as 3.8 million years ago , so it seems to have lived for almost a million years , remaining remarkably similar for all that time .
8
All the 1992 Hadar hominids are about 3 million years old ; the oldest Hadar hominids come from sediments that are 3.4 million years old .
Add on the fossils from Laetoli , a site in Tanzania , most of which date to 3.4 and 3.5 million years ago , and you have a half million years of documented Australopithecus afarensis evolution .
Including the Middle Awash site south of Hadar , where hominid fossils are 3.8 or 3.9 million years old , that adds up to almost a million years with afarensis around , evolving very little , from what we could tell after our first look at the new fossils .
9
In other words , he believes the fossils show evidence of one million years without any evolution .
Then , in the last 2.5 million years , he says , Australopithecines evolved into modern humans .
Where is the logic in that ?
The Laetoli Footprints
We even had a set of footprints .
Owen called the famous footprint trail discovered in 1978 by Mary Leakey ’s team at Laetoli , Tanzania , the “ perfect cementing evidence ” for bipedalism [ walking upright on two feet ] .
In a trail of ash that has been dated to 3.5 million years ago , the tracks of two hominids were captured for a distance of nearly eighty feet , lasting impressions that give us a direct glimpse of how they got around .
I believe that afarensis made the footprints -- first because afarensis fossils have been found at Laetoli , and second , because a composite foot , made from fossil bones belonging to Homo from nearby Olduvai Gorge combined with Hadar toe bones , has been shown to fit the Laetoli prints .
When a chimpanzee walks on two legs , it leaves a print with the big toe splayed away from the rest of the foot .
The Laetoli prints resemble modern human footprints , with the big toe in line with the other toes .
10
The facts are : 1 ) that the footprints are indistinguishable from modern human footprints and 2 ) that the rocks are unquestionably dated ( by evolutionists ’ standards ) to be 3.5 million years old .
So , what conclusions could an evolutionist reach ?
One could say that this is “ perfect cementing evidence ” that modern man ( Homo sapiens ) lived 3.5 million years ago .
If that is true , they lived before almost all of the alleged “ human ancestors ” .
Therefore , those other hominid species could not be ancestral to man .
The second conclusion one might reach is that the ash is n’t really 3.5 million years old .
If modern man has only been around for a few hundred thousand years , then the ash fell within the last few hundred thousand years .
If that is true , then Lucy lived a few hundred thousand years ago , and could not have been our ancestor .
Since the first two conclusions are unacceptable to evolutionists , they come to the third conclusion -- that afarensis ( Lucy ) made the footprints .
But look at Lucy ’s skeleton at the right .
Notice her feet in particular .
( Just kidding .
There are n’t any feet to notice . )
That ’s why they need “ a composite foot , made from fossil bones belonging to Homo from a nearby Olduvai Gorge combined with Hadar toe bones ” to compare with the tracks .
Is it scientifically valid to make a composite foot using 3.5 million - year - old toe bones from one species and foot bones from another upright - walking species that allegedly lived about one million years later ?
The very fact that Johanson has to do something this silly means that he does n’t have any 3.5 million - year - old foot bones that fit the tracks .
Lucy ’s Pelvis
Lucy ’s left innominate [ hip - joint socket ] had been bent out of shape and broken into about forty pieces while it was embedded in the ground .
Owen X - rayed the fossil and discovered that the back of Lucy ’s pelvis , where the sacrum connects with the innominate , had smashed against a rock or another bone during burial , shattering and twisting the ilium .
He then spent six months carefully outlining and numbering each fragment of ilium , casting each piece of the fossil in plaster , smoothing out the edges , and then reassembling them in a three - dimensional jigsaw puzzle .
Every fragment had to line up with adjoining pieces from both the front and the back side of the bone to convince Owen that he had overcome any distortion that occurred after the bone was damaged .
Once Owen had restored the left side of the pelvis , he sculpted a mirror image of the right side in plaster and placed Lucy ’s sacrum in between to complete his masterpiece . …
When Owen brings a human pelvis , a chimp pelvis , and a cast of Lucy ’s pelvis into an elementary - school classroom , the children have no trouble deciding which two look alike .
Lucy ’s pelvis has a bowl shape like a human pelvis , but it is not as deep .
11
So , Lucy 's left - half pelvis you saw above is n’t one piece .
It is about forty pieces that have been carefully shaped to remove the “ distortion ” they experienced during burial .
Distortion is , by definition , a deviation from the normal shape .
But since this is the only pelvis ( actually , it is just a half - pelvis ) they have for this species , how do they know what it is supposed to look like ?
All they have is a pre-conceived notion of what it should look like .
Since it did n’t look like that when it came out of the ground , they had to reshape it to look the way Owen Lovejoy thought it should look .
Why Call Lucy a “ Hominid ” ?
Over this considerable span of time the fossil remains of Australopithecus afarensis reveal a unique but constant mosaic of features : from the neck up , chimpanzee ; from the waist down , human .
12
The human characteristics are “ from the waist down . ”
Is he referring to the missing foot bones that are so remarkably human ?
Or is he referring to the composite foot bones made from a Homo species that supposedly lived more than a million years later ?
Or is it the pelvis that was radically redesigned during reconstruction to make it look more human and less “ distorted ” that is the feature that makes Lucy human from the waist down ?
What Did Johanson Really Find ?
Furthermore , by his own reckoning , he found bones that span more than one million years with very little variation in them .
He found positive evidence that Australopithecus afarensis shows virtually no sign of evolution in a million years .
Footnotes :
By today ’s standards , this commercial for the Newton is beyond boring .
But if you ’re curious , the ad is called “ Intelligence by Newton ” , and it might make the few remaining Newton die - hards swell up .
He has taken on drugs , crime and corruption in Baltimore ; and brutalised young soldiers in Iraq .
Now David Simon , the creator of the hit TV series
The Wire , is to create a drama that treats Hurricane Katrina as an allegory for the financial , social and cultural disasters that have shaken the US over the past year .
The series , called Treme , after a New Orleans neighbourhood , was commissioned by HBO earlier this month after a successful pilot , and will air in the US in 2010 .
Filming will start later this year – after the hurricane season abates .
The 10 - or 12 - part drama will be , Simon told the Guardian , " an allegory for the trauma that the country as a whole went through two years later " .
" The fact is that the levees on the canals were substandard , and done on the cheap at an immense profit .
Ultimately that becomes a metaphor , " he said .
" New Orleans was relying on things that were believed to be genuine bulwarks against tragedy and disaster .
People felt that there were similar bulwarks protecting our financial institutions and foreign policy .
Now , two years on , we are all essentially in the same boat as New Orleans .
Katrina was an outlyer of where we are today . "
Simon , whose
The Wire has been hailed as a masterpiece of novelistic , sophisticated television was speaking to the Guardian ahead of his appearance at the Guardian Hay festival , which opens tomorrow .
Simon will be speaking at the festival on 30 May about his book The Corner , an account by him and his collaborator , Ed Burns , of a year spent observing life on the street in West Baltimore .
The book , published in the US in 1997 , became the basis of The Wire , along with Homicide , Simon 's earlier book about the year he spent shadowing officers in the Baltimore Police Department .
Homicide was first published in the US in 1992 , and The Corner came out in 1997 – but it is only now , after the wildfire success of The Wire , that the works are receiving attention in the UK , after publisher Canongate picked them up , republishing Homicide last year and The Corner last month .
Simon said his late - flowering literary success in Britain was " remarkable .
Homicide was published very briefly in the UK in the 1990s , when it sold about 11 copies ... the UK has been very kind to The Wire . "
Simon was a reporter at the Baltimore Sun when he took leave of absence to work with former police officer Burns on The Corner , an example of what he called " stand around and watch " journalism – slow - burn reporting that almost became ethnography .
" The story changes the longer you stay in one place .
After two weeks your view of the situation and people changes .
After two months it might completely turn around .
I did care for those people – and I wanted their lives to end better than in many cases they did . "
The work is a lovingly detailed account of the lives of richly complex characters such as Gary McCullough , a former businessman whose life has become chaotic after becoming ensnared by heroin addiction ; and his ex-wife Fran , a junkie who struggles to cling on to the vestiges of family life .
It is a trenchantly political work , for it declines to see these otherwise overlooked people as mere statistics , but gives them vivid , human life .
And , despite his avowed admiration for Obama , Simon believes the new regime will do nothing to solve the US 's drugs problems .
" I do not believe that we have the stomach for serious change , " he said .
" The war on drugs is as disastrous as any government policy has been over the past 50 years , but I do not believe Obama and his people will use their political capital to end it ...
If a policy failed this unequivocally in any other part of US life you would cashier the generals .
But the drug problem oppresses the poor .
If rich kids were wandering the streets stealing car radios we would not be so complacent .
But it is easier to brutalise the poor and discard them .
We are not a manufacturing economy any more and we do n't need our least educated people , so we marginalise them .
The cynicism of Reagan and Thatcher still applies . "
On Treme , Simon said : " It picks up three months after the storm , and will deliver a story of people trying to pick up their lives and culture again .
New Orleans is one of the most extraordinary cultural creations in the US in terms of almost every artform – and it is very vulnerable .
The characters have to find their way back and try to solve the existential crisis that Katrina has left them . "
The show will be , he said , a " homage to one of America 's greatest achievements , African - American music .
A thousand years from now , if anyone is talking about anything on this rotating orb , and they mention America , they might talk about constitutional government or democracy or baseball – but they will surely talk about blues and jazz .
New Orleans is the cradle of all that . "
The Guardian Hay festival this year foregrounds major religious figures .
Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury , will speak to AN Wilson ; and Desmond Tutu will deliver a lecture .
Major literary figures speaking include Alan Bennett ; the Swedish thriller writer Henning Mankell ; novelists Anne Michaels , Rose Tremain and Sarah Waters ; and poets Simon Armitage and Carol Ann Duffy , the new poet laureate .
The science programme homes in on the politics of climate change , with highlights including Nicholas Stern and Anthony Giddens .
The Guardian Hay festival runs from tomorrow until 31 May .
I 'm not a lawyer so I will leave the legal parsings to others .
But I do want to note something quite odd in Andy McCarthy 's latest defense of torture as national policy for the US .
He wants to argue that those who waterboarded terror suspects were not torturing per se because they were intending to procure intelligence , and not torturing purely for the hell of it .
I do n't believe there 's much evidence that the intent of the torture program was sadism , although obviously once you condone torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners in any war , the sadism will emerge .
And I see no evidence that those who waterboarded Zubaydah were doing it for the evil joy of it ( although we do n't know who the torturers were exactly in that case , or most others ) .
But this is all irrelevant .
The crime of torture is not about sadism .
It is specifically about getting intelligence .
The UN Convention 's definition could n't be clearer on this :
[ A ] ny act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him , or a third person , information or a confession , punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating or coercing him or a third person , or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind , when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity .
It does not include pain or suffering arising only from , inherent in , or incidental to , lawful sanctions .
Torture is not sadism ; it can be done from misguided but not sadistic motives , i.e. the false belief that it 's necessary to procure intelligence .
No SERE training does this .
No SERE - trained soldier is genuinely being coerced to give up information ; they have the ability to end the session at any time ; and the point is to help them resist such torture techniques .
Those administering it are thereby not torturers - legally or morally .
They are not trying to obliterate a human being 's agency by subjecting him to this terrifying ordeal for 183 times ; they are trying to train someone to retain their psychic integrity under this kind of pressure .
( And you 'll notice that waterboarding can be used this way on trainee soldiers in a way that , say , stress positions , or cold cells , can't .
That 's because stress positions and cold cells are , in most cases , worse than waterboarding . )
What the far right wants is to turn this into a question of graphic sadism or to present those of us who support Obama 's return to the rule of law and human decency as seeking to prove the equivalence of George Bush and Pol Pot .
We 're not .
We 're saying that torture is torture ; that the intent to procure intelligence from it in no way mitigates it ( indeed more precisely fits the UN definition ) ; that America did it ; and that those responsible need to be held accountable .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

IT HAS been a cheerful couple of days for those starved of bright economic news .
Hopeful statistics have been trickling in from many parts of the world .
On Friday May 29th revised first quarter GDP figures for America showed that the economy there had contracted slightly less than had earlier been reported .
In addition durable - goods orders in the country rose by the most in 16 months .
In Japan , factory output rose by 5.2 % in April , the biggest monthly increase , in percentage terms , in over half a century .
And in the first quarter India 's economy grew by a bullish 5.8 % , compared with a year before , while South Korea 's industrial production continued to rise in April .
Even in gloomy Europe there are encouraging signs .
Poland 's GDP ticked up by 0.8 % in the first quarter , as did German private consumption ( in the same period ) and retail sales also grew , by 0.5 % , in April .
British consumer confidence remained steady in April , and house prices there rose both in March and May , according to one index .
For optimists , these are all signs that might point towards the beginning of the end of the “ Great Recession ” .
Headline writers , and those who are urging stockmarkets to continue rising , will continue to talk of hopes of recovery .
Yet a closer look at the detail of the latest figures suggests that hope springs eternal and will latch on to what it can — even when a more sober analysis would suggest there is a long way to go before recovery sets in .
Optimists make much of statistics that beat analysts ' expectations .
But when a particular figure outdoes predictions it may be because those expectations were overly pessimistic , rather than a sign that something fundamental has changed for the better .
What , for instance , is the right reference point on the latest news on India 's economy ?
Doomsters might fret that it has grown at the slowest quarterly pace in several years .
Cheerleaders could rejoice that it has expanded slightly faster than most people had expected .
Weary of negative news , the latter explanation is a tempting way to make sense of the numbers , but the gloomy view is equally valid .
Consider , too , the figures for consumer confidence in Britain .
Although consumer gloom seems to have abated , the reported level of – 27 is remarkably low by historical standards .
If one takes into account reports that British consumers had been growing a bit more confident in recent months , the latest statistic could suggest a halt to a small rally , which is hardly something to cheer .
This example highlights the difficulty of extrapolating from a single month or quarter of data , which can easily be skewed by one - off events such as a national holiday or sudden desperate measures by retailers to offload stock .
Discerning whether a more sustained recovery might be under way takes , unsurprisingly , more data .
Thus pessimists , who are unconvinced that the worst is over for the world economy , have much to reinforce their dark mood .
One particular concern is that the financial and credit problems at the root of the global recession have not been dealt with satisfactorily .
Keiichiro Kobayashi , a Japanese economist , has looked back to Japan 's experience in the late 1990s and argues that unless the banks are fixed , a strong recovery for the world economy is impossible .
Some disagree , suggesting that economic output can bounce back even before credit and financial markets are again healthy , if consumers get their wallets open .
But even if this argument is compelling in some historical cases , this time it seems that household spending in many economies will remain weak because of high levels of debt .
One man who has made his name in recent years as a doom - monger , Nouriel Roubini , an economist at New York University , recently suggested that recovery from recession was far from imminent , arguing that “ it 's going to last another six to nine months ” .
It might not be surprising that he avoids a bullish prediction , but Mr Roubini goes one step further , noting that other economists are still suggesting a “ doomsday ” scenario , with continuing contraction for a long time to come , and thus even he could be considered as an optimist .

868 : The Diamond Sutra , a 16 - foot scroll containing one of the most cherished Buddhist texts , is printed .
A dated colophon is included , making it the first known block - printed text to carry an explicit date .
The Chinese text , translated from Sanskrit , is a relatively short sutra dealing with the core Buddhist practice of non-abidance .
The scroll includes six separate sheets that were printed using wood blocks , plus a single woodcut depicting Buddha with his disciples and a couple of cats .
Each sheet measures 12 by 30 inches .
The printer , Wang Jie , pasted them together to form the scroll .
The Diamond Sutra is not the earliest example of block printing , but it is the earliest to carry a colophon that includes a verifiable date .
Wang Jie 's colophon reads :
" Reverently made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong . "
On the modern calendar , that works out to May 11 , 868 .
The original scroll eventually disappeared and lay undisturbed until its discovery a thousand years later , unearthed along with the Dunhuang manuscripts in one of the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas in Turkestan , along the Silk Road trading route .
The Diamond Sutra now resides at the British Museum in London .

Graffiti artist Banksy has unveiled his most ambitious British project to date , a made over museum in his home town of Bristol .
Staged in the council - owned City Museum and Art Gallery , Banksy v Bristol Museum was such a closely guarded secret even senior councillors were unaware of the plans , while visitors and staff were told that filming had been taking place .
The exhibition features animatronics , installations and a sensory display .
Jon Kay takes a look at some of the artworks on display and talks to Kate Brindley , Museum Director .
It looks like L.A. air could be killing us in more ways than one .
Two studies released Wednesday have linked toxic air pollution in Southern California to cancer and complications with birth .
Exposure to local traffic - generated pollution increased the risk of major complications and preterm birth , concluded a report published online in Environmental Health Perspectives .
Local scientists studied the relationship of traffic pollution , preterm birth and a complication called preeclampsia that can lead to maternal and perinatal morbidity .
By measuring pregnant women 's exposure to chemicals emitted by local traffic ( nitrogen oxides and particulate matter ) , the researchers concluded that the risk for preeclampsia increased by as much as 42 % at the highest exposures .
The risk for " very preterm delivery " ( meaning delivery when the fetus is less than 30 weeks old ) increased by as much as 128 % for women exposed to the highest levels .
The study was the first to look at the connection between preeclampsia and air toxics .
It focused on births in Los Angeles and Orange counties .
Meanwhile , an Environmental Protection Agency study found that Los Angeles has some of the highest levels of cancer - related toxic air pollutants in the country .
For residents of Cerritos , located at the heart of the L.A. basin , the EPA estimated the cancer risk due to air toxics at 1,200 in 1 million , the highest in the country and more than 33 times the national average .
The statistic represents the expected number of additional deaths per million people , based on a lifetime exposure to the chemicals .
ST . JOHN'S , N.L. - Lawyers in Canada are increasingly warning their clients about the perils of posting information on social websites such as Facebook after a small but growing number of cases faltered because of damning messages and photographs .
Last month , a Newfoundland man 's lawsuit was largely foiled , partly because of Facebook postings that contradicted his claims .
Dennis
Terry filed the suit after suffering whiplash from two car accidents in 2001 and 2003 .
In addition to other losses , he argued the injuries harmed his social life , claiming his friends stopped phoning him to go out after he repeatedly declined their invitations .
At one point , Terry testified he had trouble playing pool -- a pastime he often enjoyed with friends -- because he was unable to bend over the table after making a couple of shots .
But after defence lawyers produced evidence from Terry 's Facebook profile that suggested a life brimming with activity , provincial Supreme Court Justice James Adams concluded the plaintiff exaggerated the toll his injuries took .
" He went to and hosted parties , attended weekend outings at summer cabins , drank alcohol frequently , smoked marijuana daily and appeared to have a number of friends with whom he communicated and socialized on a regular basis , " Adams wrote in his April 17 ruling .
" I find it incredible that Mr. Terry 's social life miraculously improved in the few months he was communicating on Facebook and that for the remainder of the time from 2001 to 2007 he essentially had no or little social life .
Without this evidence , I would have been left with a very different impression of Mr. Terry 's social life . "
After defence lawyers confronted him with the Facebook evidence , Terry closed his account .
He was awarded $ 40,000 in general damages and suffering , but the judge rejected his other claims that sought up to $ 1.3 million .
Terry and his lawyer declined to comment on the case .
It 's one of a few across Canada that highlights how information posted on Facebook or other social networking sites , including MySpace and Twitter , can come back to destroy a case under the scrutiny of a courtroom .
In February , Ontario Superior Court Justice David Brown ruled that a man suing over injuries from a 2004 car accident must submit to cross-examination from defence lawyers about postings on his Facebook account , including content not available to the public .
" To permit a party claiming very substantial damages for loss of enjoyment of life to hide behind self - set privacy controls on a website , the primary purpose of which is to enable people to share information about how they lead their social lives , risks depriving the opposite party of access to material that may be relevant to ensuring a fair trial , " Brown ruled .
Brenda Hollingsworth , a personal injury lawyer in Ottawa , says uncovering as much information as possible about potential clients has become part of her vetting process before taking on cases .
" I now routinely Google my own clients just to let them know what 's on there and to make sure that I 'm not surprised , " Hollingsworth said .
" As these decisions come out , lawyers clue in that we have to warn our clients about this , and I 'm willing to bet that ( for ) most personal injury lawyers , that 's part of their opening pitch to prospective clients : ` Do n't be an idiot about what you put on Facebook . ' "
But online scribbles and pictures can be an unfair evidentiary tool if used out of context , she said .
" You may have someone after an accident who goes to one special occasion and swallows a bottle of Tylenol to go , and then all of a sudden that one three - hour night five years ago becomes blown out of proportion , " she said .
" These pictures get blown up for the jury and they 've got you with a beer in your hand , sitting in a lawn chair and no amount of explanation can really shake that image . "
The increasing use of information on social networking sites as evidence underscores the importance of honesty and managing one 's online persona , Hollingsworth said .
" The bottom line is if you 're scrupulously honest , you can't be tripped up by a photo . "

If you travel a great deal in your line of work , you know the trade offs involved with trying to pack and transport as many business tools and reference materials as possible into the smallest amount of space ( in addition to the rest of your luggage ) .
Mastering this art can mean more productive business meetings on the road ; fewer missed flights from running through concourses with excess baggage ; and far less stress in your life overall .
Several high tech manufacturers have embraced this challenge by developing innovative new products that can increase your productivity and at the same time , reduce the size and weight of your luggage .
Once you learn about these products and start to use them , you will very likely consider them to be “ essential ” gear for road warriors like yourself and wonder how you ever survived without them .
You ’ve heard the saying : “ Good things come in small packages . ”
Here are a few new products that exemplify this phrase and can make your life on the road much easier and more productive for a reasonable price .
Mobile Digital Scribes :
This category of products has been around for a few years , but really has n’t reached the mainstream due to technical hurdles that needed to be cleared .
The good news is that a paradigm shift is now underway !
This is being led by IOGEAR Inc. , a consumer electronics company who offers a range of cutting - edge products offering connectivity , networking , mobility and desktop computing solutions .
IOGEAR ’s new GPEN200N Mobile Digital Scribe , which looks very much like a normal ballpoint pen , captures handwritten notes and drawings as the user writes and stores them as images in a small , portable electronic receiving unit .
These images can then be easily uploaded to any PC where OCR recognition software converts the handwritten notes into digital text .
This groundbreaking product eliminates the need for lugging a computer to meetings or having to balance your PC on your tray table in - flight .
You simply take handwritten notes and then upload to your computer at your convenience .
( You can even e-mail your handwritten notes and drawings if you like . )
The price is around $ 100 .
Ultra-Mobile Personal Computers ( UMPC’s ) :
These are also known as “ Netbooks ” or mini-notebook PC’s .
When this new product category was first introduced recently , the concept focused primarily on providing a lightweight , compact solution for fast , easy internet browsing and e-mail access ( hence the nickname “ Netbooks ” ) .
Due to inadequate hard drive capacities , early UMPC ’s had limited software capabilities compared to their larger notebook PC cousins .
However , that has changed dramatically with the introduction of Micro - Star International ’s new line of MSI Wind Netbook computers , winners of PC Magazine ’s Editors ’ Choice Award in 2008 .
These sleek machines offer massive hard drive capacities ( 160 GB ) with efficient Intel Atom processors running Windows XP
Home edition , which allows them to operate like much larger notebook PC’s .
And they do this in a 2.3 lb. package that ’s about the size of a hardback novel ( 10.3 ” x 7 ” x 1.3 ” ) .
These machines can deliver notebook performance in “ nano ” size for under $ 500 .
Keyboard , Video , Mouse Switches ( KVM’s ) :
These are firmware devices that allow a user to control multiple computers from a single keyboard , video monitor and mouse .
Once again , IOGEAR , Inc. is on the leading edge of technology for business travelers with its new USB Laptop KVM Switch .
This product supplies “ plug and play ” USB convenience for easy switching and file transfers between two computers ( can be between any combination of desktop , laptop or netbook PC’s ) .
It is excellent for business travelers who travel with one computer and have another at home or their office and wish to keep files on both computers for backup and various different applications .
This KVM product is compact , lightweight and is compatible with Windows 2000 , XP and Vista .
The price is under $ 100 .
Mobile Printers :
If you are a one - person show and need the functionality of an office in your carry - on , the Canon Pixma iP100 Photo Printer is your best bet .
Not only is it fast , it is also very easy to set up and use .
Keep one thing in mind : if you ’re looking for laser graphics , go to Kinko’s .
But when you need a printing solution “ on - the - run ” , this is an excellent choice .
The ink jet unit is compact and light ( 4.4 lbs. ) and costs about $ 250 .
Portable Projectors :
This product category is astounding and Dell ’s M109S ( lovingly termed “ pocket projector ” ) leads the charge .
Earning an Editors ’ Choice award from PC Magazine is a lofty accomplishment .
This unit is about the size of a heavy pack of cigarettes ( 1.5 ” x 3.6 ” x 4.1 ” and under 1 pound ) .
Plus , it ’s remarkably easy to use in minutes !
And , considering what you would have paid a year ago for a unit about 5 times larger , this is a bargain at about $ 500 .
There you have it , affordable new products that can make your life on the road easier and should prove to be essential gear in your future travels .
Absolutely wrong , Rafa .
That is precisely the price you have to pay to ensure your sport is as clean as possible .
It is the price Cycling and Athletics has been paying through clenched teeth for years and getting maligned for it .
Why is tennis not prepared to pay this price ?
The sport lends itself well to possible drug misuse and there are persistent reports in the Spanish press that some very big name tennis players were uncovered in the Operation Puerto exercise a few years back which exposed a number of cyclists allegedly involved in blood doping .
On September 15 , around 2,000 LGBT rights activists marched through Kharkiv in the first event of its kind in the eastern Ukrainian city .
When the march ended , most of the participants left safely through a nearby subway station , but a crowd of far - right counterdemonstrators had gathered in a neighbouring park , apparently on the hunt for LGBT activists attempting to leave on foot .
Video from the scene captured one slightly - built teenager with a streak of dyed hair trying to move through the burly opposition group .
Suddenly a tattooed man slaps the teen in the head and a mob chases him — kicking at his legs and punching him in the head — as his female friend , wearing a rainbow T - shirt , looks on helplessly .
After the teen is kicked to the ground amid chants and cheers , two masked men try to stomp on and kick him in the head .
Gleb Garanich , a veteran photographer with Reuters , shot several photographs of the shocking scene that unfolded in front of him .
Garanich has covered conflicts , mostly in the former Soviet Union , since 1991 and understands street violence better than most journalists .
In 2013 , he was famously photographed soaked with blood after being struck by a riot policeman during Ukraine ’s 2013 - 2014 Euromaidan protests .
As the beating continued in Kharkiv ’s Shevchenko Park , a second photographer , Andrew Kravchenko , captured what happened next .
After the same tattooed man who had begun the violence grabbed hold of the badly hurt teen , Garanich stepped in to seize the boy from the man ’s grasp and , without addressing the mob , simply walked the teen out of the situation .
In an email , Garanich states that he intervened “ because there was a serious threat to [ the teenager ’s ] life . ”
Kravchenko agrees , saying if it were not for Garanich ’s actions , the boy “ could have been killed ” by a mob which was hungry for violence and low on targets .
“ In short , ” Kravchenko said on Facebook , Garanich is “ a real man . ”
Kharkiv police say they are aware of the attack in Shevchenko Park and “ investigative actions are ongoing . ”

LIBERTY DOLLAR ALERT :
June 2009 Vol. 11 No. 06 - A Urgent News for All Liberty Dollar Supporters !
FBI Arrests Bernard , Kevin , Sarah & Rachelle
The battle for a value based currency has begun !
The last two days have been amazing !
Just shortly after midnight on Tuesday , the phone started ringing and I let the answering machine take the call .
But very soon there was another call with an even more urgent message !
Very quickly , a friend of Kevin Innes , explained to me that Kevin had been " detained " by the local sheriff and was being held for the FBI to arrest him !
Holy Cow !!
The # 2 supporter for the Liberty Dollar and co-instructor at the Liberty Dollar University training sessions was in deep trouble with the Feds !
I was sure to be next .
But would they arrive in a few minutes or would it be a pre-dawn Nazi style assault ?
Finally , I got up at 4:00 AM .
I was very concerned for Kevin and wondered when the FBI would hit me .
Fortunately the morning was quickly filled with a flurry of calls from Kevin 's friend , other interested parties , the usual business calls and making preparations for the inevitable knock on the door .
But nobody came .
Then just after noon , Niles , who 's wife , Rachelle , manages the Liberty Dollar Fulfillment Office , called to tell me that Rachelle had been picked up by the FBI at the LD Office and was due to be arraigned in just a few hours !
The FBI strikes again !
Luckily , I was able to talk to Rachelle via her cell phone while the FBI was holding her .
I was pleased that the FBI agents were the friendly professional types and afforded Rachelle and I quite a few minutes of private conversation .
Under the circumstances , Rachelle 's demeanor and resolve was right on target .
And very quickly , I learned that a warrant had been issued for my arrest .
And just a quickly , Rachelle was off to court to be arraigned .
Much later in the afternoon , I learned to my surprise that three big FBI agents had arrested Sarah at work .
She and Rachelle were arraigned together and quickly released to on their own recognizance ( OR ) before the sun set on a very eventful day for the Liberty Dollar .
The quick , professional effort with Sarah and Rachelle were gratifying and encouraging .
Unfortunately , I was to learn that Sarah lost her job because of this event .
By last afternoon it was clear that the Liberty Dollar would be best served by my turning myself in to the to the US Marshals , otherwise know as ' self reporting . '
After a few calls , I found myself talking to Agent Andy ( aka Agent F ) who was his usual friendly , chatty self .
He even recognized my voice although we had only spoken twice and that was over 18 months ago .
Sure enough he confirmed that a federal arrest warrant for my arrest had been issued .
And after a bit of gamesmanship with Agent Andy , I agreed to report to the US Marshal 's office in Fort Myers , Florida at 9:00 AM on Thursday morning as it was too late to be arraigned , plus an overnight in jail would have wrinkled by clothes :)
The following morning , Thursday , June 4 , 2009 , I actually arrived at the Marshal 's office at 8:30 due to light traffic .
As the saying goes , " If you gotta do time , do federal time . "
Quite simply , the federal boys are better educated , better trained and have better manners .
I was immediately escorted to a holding cell .
After an hour or less , I met with the Pre-Trila Service rep and made it to court at 11:00 in chains and handcuffs .
The female judge was businesslike and granted my request to attend my son's graduation in Physics from UCLA next week .
After fingerprinting , signing a $ 50,000 Appearance Bond , one final meeting with the Pre-Indictment Service rep , I was free .
In general , the arraignment was a pleasant affair .
The US Marshals did their job with very little attitude , as they should .
After all , I am self reporting , and it is n't for anything violent , I just want to prove that I have a right to issue my own currency and if any body chooses to use it then it is a " private contract . "
It is certainly not a crime .
And so it came to pass , 2009 years after the birth of Christ , that four regular Americans have taken a stand to defend the People 's right to protect themselves from a government currency that has a long and unforgiving history of stealing the people 's purchasing power .
This is a test of individual rights , as protected by the Tenth Amendment .
It is the deciding moment that a private voluntary barter currency ( PVBC ) is legal in the great United States of America .
This is a test that the Liberty Dollar must and will pass , for that I have no doubt .
But it will not be easy or cheap .
Please , if you support our efforts , support us with any kind of money you have , including pro bono services .
Now that the Liberty Dollar faces a federal criminal trial , it is the US Government v Liberty Dollar ala Bernard , Kevin , Sarah & Rachelle .
Please help us win .
Please help yourself win .
Please help American win .
Very simply this is a Win or Lose battle .
In addition to money for this legal fight we need articles that reference non-government currency , such as Air Miles as currency , legal research assistance , expert witnesses , legal assistance , etc .
If you support the ideals of the Liberty Dollar , this is the time to get behind the Liberty Dollar .
We critically need your help !
Please send your digital info to Legal@LibertyDollar.org and your donations of value including other kinds of " currencies " to :

The best news is that the Liberty Dollar finally has the opportunity to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is legal .
Over two years ago I sued the US government for a Declaratory Judgment to resolve the legality issue .
And how did they respond , they raided the Liberty Dollar and confiscated over $ 4 million dollars in gold , silver and cash .
The US government has done everything possible to kill the Liberty Dollar !
And guess what ?
It has not worked .
The mere fact that the Liberty Dollar is still in business is a testament to your demand for Real Money and the ideals that the Liberty Dollar represents .
Thank you , thank you , thank you for your support !
Trust me , the Liberty Dollar is not made up of any fat cats .
We are all just regular Americans .
And we all just want good money , a lot less government and no damn war !
